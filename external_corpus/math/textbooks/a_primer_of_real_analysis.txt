Preface

This is a short introduction to the fundamentals of real analysis. Although the
prerequisites are few, I have written the text assuming the reader has the level
of mathematical maturity of one who has completed the standard sequence of
calculus courses, has had some exposure to the ideas of mathematical proof (in-
cluding induction), and has an acquaintance with such basic ideas as equivalence
relations and the elementary algebraic properties of the integers.

Fundamentals

1.1 Sets and relations

1.1.1 The integers

Kronecker once said, "God made the integers; all the rest is the work of man."
Taking this as our starting point, we assume the existence of the set

Z = {. . . , -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .},  (1.1.1)

the set of integers. Moreover, we assume the properties of the operations of addi-
tion and multiplication of integers, along with other elementary properties such
as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, that is, the statement that every
integer may be factored into a product of prime numbers and this factorization
is essentially unique.

1.1.2 Sets

We will take a naive view of sets: given any property p, we may determine a
set by collecting together all objects which have property p. This may be done
either by explicit enumeration, such as, p is the property of being one of a, b,
or c, which creates the set {a, b, c}, or by stating the desired property, such as,
p is the property of being a positive integer, which creates the set

Z+ = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}.                     (1.1.2)

    The notation x  A indicates that x is an element of the set A. Given sets
A and B, we say A is a subset of B, denoted A  B, if from the fact that x  A
it necessarily follows that x  B. We say sets A and B are equal if both A  B
and B  A.

    Given two sets A and B, we call the set

A  B = {x : x  A or x  B}                     (1.1.3)

                        1
2                                 CHAPTER 1. FUNDAMENTALS

the union of A and B and the set

                      A  B = {x : x  A and x  B}                (1.1.4)

the intersection of A and B. We call the set

                           A \ B = {x : x  A, x / B}            (1.1.5)

the difference of A and B.
    More generally, if I is a set and {A :   I} is a collection of sets, one for

each element of I, then we have the union

                          A = {x : x  A for some }              (1.1.6)

                      I

and the intersection

                          A = {x : x  A for all }.              (1.1.7)

                      I

Example 1.1.1. For example, if I = {2, 3, 4, . . .} and we let

   A2 = {n : n  Z+, n > 1, n = 2m for any m  Z+ with m > 1}

and, for any i  I, i > 2,

   Ai = {n : n  Ai-1, n = mi for any m  Z+ with m > 1},

then iI Ai is the set of prime numbers.
    If A and B are both sets, we call the set

                      A × B = {(a, b) : a  A, b  B}             (1.1.8)

the cartesian product of A and B. If A = B, we write

                           A2 = A × A.                          (1.1.9)

Example 1.1.2. Z2 = {(m, n) : m  Z, n  Z} is the set of all ordered pairs of
integers.

1.1.3 Relations

Given two sets A and B, we call a subset R of A × B a relation. Given a
relation R, we will write a R b, or simply a  b if R is clear from the context,
to indicate that (a, b)  R.

Example 1.1.3. We say that an integer m divides and integer n if n = mi for
some integer i. If we let

                        R = {(m, n) : m  Z, n  Z, m divides n},

then R is a relation. For example, 3 R 12.
1.2. FUNCTIONS                                                           3

    Consider a set A and a relation R  A2. For purposes of conciseness, we
say simply that R is a relation on A. If R is such that a R a for every a  A,
we say R is reflexive; if R is such that b R a whenever a R b, we say R is
symmetric; if a R b and b R c together imply a R c, we say R is transitive.
We call a relation which is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive an equivalence

relation .

Exercise 1.1.1. Show that the relation R on Z defined by m R n if m divides
n is reflexive and transitive, but not symmetric.

Exercise 1.1.2. Show that the relation R on Z defined by m R n if m - n is
even is an equivalence relation.

Given an equivalence relation R on a set A and an element x  A, we call

                             [x] = {y : y  A, y R x}  (1.1.10)

the equivalence class of x.

Exercise 1.1.3. Given an equivalence relation R on a set A, show that
a. [x]  [y] =  if and only if x R y;
b. [x] = [y] if and only if x R y.

    As a consequence of the previous exercise, the equivalence classes of an
equivalence relation on a set A constitute a partition of A (that is, A may be
written as the disjoint union of the equivalence classes).

Exercise 1.1.4. Find the equivalence classes for the equivalence relation in
Exercise 1.1.2.

1.2 Functions

If A and B are sets, we call a relation R  A × B a function with domain A
if for every a  A there exists one, and only one, b  B such that (a, b)  R.
We typically indicate such a relation with the notation f : A  B, and write
f (a) = b to indicate that (a, b)  R. We call the set of all b  B such that
f (a) = b for some a  A the range of f . With this notation, we often refer to
R as the graph of f .

    We say f : A  B is one-to-one if for every b in the range of f there exists a
unique a  A such that f (a) = b. We say f is onto if for every b  B there exists
at least one a  A such that f (a) = b. For example, the function f : Z+  Z+
4                               CHAPTER 1. FUNDAMENTALS

defined by f (z) = z2 is one-to-one, but not onto, whereas the function f : Z  Z
defined by f (z) = z + 1 is both one-to-one and onto.

    Given two functions, g : A  B and f : B  C, we define the composition,
denoted f  g : A  C, to be the function defined by f  g(a) = f (g(a)).

    If f : A  B is both one-to-one and onto, then we may define a function
f -1 : B  A by requiring f -1(b) = a if and only if f (a) = b. Note that this
implies that f  f -1(b) = b for all b  B and f -1  f (a) = a for all a  A. We
call f -1 the inverse of f .

    Given any collection of nonempty sets, {A},   I, we assume the existence
of a function  : I  B, B = I A, with the property that ()  A. We
call such a function a choice function. The assumption that choice functions

always exist is known as the Axiom of Choice.

1.3 Rational numbers

Let P = {(p, q) : p, q  Z, q = 0}. We define an equivalence relation on P by
saying (p, q)  (s, t) if pt = qs.

Exercise 1.3.1. Show that the relation as just defined is indeed an equivalence
relation.

    We will denote the equivalence class of (p, q)  P by p/q, or qp . We call the
set of all equivalence classes of P the rational numbers, which we denote by Q.
If p  Z, we will denote the equivalence class of (p, 1) by p; that is, we let

                        p                                                     (1.3.1)
                          = p.

                        1

In this way, we may think of Z as a subset of Q.

1.3.1 Field properties

We wish to define operations of addition and multiplication on elements of Q.

We begin by defining operations on the elements of P . Namely, given (p, q)  P

and (s, t)  P , define

                        (p, q)  (s, t) = (pt + sq, qt)                        (1.3.2)

and

                        (p, q)  (s, t) = (ps, qt).                            (1.3.3)

Now suppose (p, q)  (a, b) and (s, t)  (c, d). It follows that (p, q)  (s, t) 
(a, b)  (c, d), that is, (pt + sq, qt)  (ad + cb, bd), since

     (pt + sq)bd = pbtd + sdqb = qatd + tcqb = (ad + cb)qt.                   (1.3.4)

Moreover, (p, q)  (s, t)  (a, b)  (c, d), that is, (ps, qt)  (ac, bd), since

                        psbd = pbsd = qatc = qtac.                            (1.3.5)
1.3. RATIONAL NUMBERS                                                            5

This shows that the equivalence class of a sum or product depends only on the
equivalence classes of the elements being added or multiplied. Thus we may
define addition and multiplication on Q by

                                     p s pt + sq                            (1.3.6)
                                           +=
                                     qt             qt

and p s ps
                                           q × t = qt ,                     (1.3.7)

and the results will not depend on which representatives we choose for each

equivalence class. Of course, multiplication is often denoted using juxtaposition,

that is,                             p × s = p s,
                                     q t qt
                                                                            (1.3.8)

and repeated multiplication may be denoted by exponentiation, that is, an,

a  Q and n  Z+, represents the product of a with itself n times.         p
                                                                         q
Note that if (p, q)  P ,         then (-p, q)  (p, -q).  Hence,  if a =      Q,  then

we let                               - a = -p = p .
                                               q -q
                                                                            (1.3.9)

For any a, b  Q, we will write a - b to denote a + (-b).
             p
If  a     =  q    Q  with  p  =  0,  then  we  let

                                           a-1 = q .                        (1.3.10)
                                                    p

Moreover, we will write

                                           1 = a-1,                         (1.3.11)
                                           a                                (1.3.12)

                                           an 1 = a-n                       (1.3.13)

for any n  Z+, and, for any b  Q,

                                           b = ba-1.
                                           a

It is now easy to show that

1. a + b = b + a for all a, b  Q;
2. (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all a, b, c  Q;
3. ab = ba for all a, b  Q;
4. (ab)c = a(bc) for all a, b, c  Q;
5. a(b + c) = ab + ac for all a, b, c  Q;
6. a + 0 = a for all a  Q;

7. a + (-a) = 0 for all a  Q;

8. 1a = a for all a  Q;

9. if a  Q, a = 0, then aa-1 = 1.

Taken together, these statements imply that Q is a field .

1.3.2 Order and metric properties

We say a rational number a is positive if there exist p, q  Z+ such that a = qp .
We denote the set of all positive elements of Q by Q+.

    Given a, b  Q, we say a is less than b, or, equivalently, b is greater than a,
denoted either by a < b or b > a, if b - a is positive. In particular, a > 0 if
and only if a is positive. If a < 0, we say a is negative. We write a  b, or,
equivalently, b  a, if either a < b or a = b.

Exercise 1.3.2. Show that for any a  Q, one and only one of the following
must hold: (a) a < 0, (b) a = 0, (c) a > 0.

Exercise 1.3.3. Show that if a, b  Q+, then a + b  Q+.
Exercise 1.3.4. Suppose a, b, c  Q. Show each of the following:

a. One, and only one, of the following must hold:

    (i) a < b,
   (ii) a = b,
   (iii) a > b.

b. If a < b and b < c, then a < c.

c. If a < b, then a + c < b + c.

d. If a > 0 and b > 0, then ab > 0.

Exercise 1.3.5. Show that if a, b  Q with a > 0 and b < 0, then ab < 0.

Exercise 1.3.6. Show that if a, b, c  Q with a < b, then ac < bc if c > 0 and
ac > bc if c < 0.

Exercise 1.3.7. Show that if a, b  Q with a < b, then

                                  a<  a+b  < b.

                                      2

   As a consequence of Exercise 1.3.4 we say Q is an ordered field .
   For any a  Q, we call

                          |a| = a,         if a  0,                   (1.3.14)
                                   -a,     if a < 0,

the absolute value of a.
1.3. RATIONAL NUMBERS                                                                           7

Exercise 1.3.8. Show that for any a  Q, -|a|  a  |a|.

Proposition 1.3.1. For any a, b  Q, |a + b|  |a| + |b|.
Proof. If a + b  0, then

      |a| + |b| - |a + b| = |a| + |b| - a - b = (|a| - a) + (|b| - b).                    (1.3.15)

Both of the terms on the right are nonnegative by Exercise 1.3.8. Hence the
sum is nonnegative and the proposition follows. If a + b < 0, then

      |a| + |b| - |a + b| = |a| + |b| + a + b = (|a| + a) + (|b| + b).                    (1.3.16)

Again, both of the terms on the right are nonnegative by Exercise 1.3.8. Hence

the sum is nonnegative and the theorem follows.                                           Q.E.D.

It is now easy to show that the absolute value satisfies

1. |a - b|  0 for all a, b  Q, with |a - b| = 0 if and only if a = b,

2. |a - b| = |b - a| for all a, b  Q,

3. |a - b|  |a - c| + |c - b| for all a, b, c  Q.

Note that the last statement, known as the triangle inequality, follows from
writing

                              a - b = (a - c) + (c - b)                                   (1.3.17)

and applying the previous proposition. These properties show that the function

                                    d(a, b) = |a - b|                                     (1.3.18)

is a metric, and we will call |a - b| the distance from a to b.

Suppose        a, b    Q+  with  a  <  b  and    let  p, q, r, s    Z+    such  that  a   =  p  and
                                                                                             q

b = rs . For any n  Z+, we have

                           na - b = n p - r = nps - rq .                                  (1.3.19)
                                          qs             qs

If we choose n large enough so that nps - rq > 0, it follows that na - b > 0,

that is, na > b. We say that the ordered field Q is archimedean. Note that it
                                                                                b
also  follows  that  we  may  choose   n  large  enough  to       ensure  that  n  <  a.

1.3.3 Upper and lower bounds

Definition 1.3.1. Let A  Q. If s  Q is such that s  a for every a  A, then
we call s an upper bound for A. If s is an upper bound for A with the property
that s  t whenever t is an upper bound for A, then we call s the supremum,
or least upper bound , of A, denoted s = sup A. Similarly, if r  Q is such that
r  a for every a  A, then we call r a lower bound for A. If r is a lower bound
for A with the property that r  t whenever t is a lower bound for A, then we
call r the infimum, or greatest lower bound , of A, denoted r = inf A.

Exercise 1.3.9. Show that the supremum of a set A  Q, if it exists, is unique,
and thus justify the use of the definite article in the previous definition.

    A set which does not have an upper bound will not, a fortiori, have a supre-
mum. Moreover, even sets which have upper bounds need not have a supremum.

Example 1.3.1. Q does not have an upper bound.
Example 1.3.2. Consider the set

                                   A = {a : a  Q+, a2 < 2}.
Note that if a, b  Q+ with a < b, then

                                 b2 - a2 = (b - a)(b + a) > 0,

from which it follows that a2 < b2. Hence if a  Q+ with a2 > 2, then a is an
upper bound for A. For example, 4 is an upper bound for A.

    Now suppose s  Q+ is the supremum of A. We must have either s2 < 2,
s2 > 2, or s2 = 2.

    Suppose s2 < 2 and let = 2 - s2. By the archimedean property of Q, we
may choose n  Z+ such that

                                    2s + 1
                                             <,

                                       n

from which it follows that

                          2s 1 2s + 1n 2s + 1
                             + 2=                                <.
                          nn               n               n

Hence                        1 2 2 2s 1 2

                      s+            = s + + 2 < s + = 2,
                             n                nn

which  implies  that  s+  1     A.  Since  s  <  s+  1n ,  this  contradicts  the  assumption
                          n

that s is an upper bound for A.
1.3. RATIONAL NUMBERS                                                             9

So now suppose s2 > 2. Again let n  Z+ and note that

                               s-  1 2 2 2s 1
                                           = s - + 2.
                                   n                   nn

If we let = s2 - 2, then we may choose n  Z+ so that

                                           2s
                                               <.

                                           n

It follows that             1 2 2 1 1

                     s-     n      > s - + 2 = 2 + 2 > 2.
                                                n             n

Thus  s-  1  is  an  upper  bound  for  A  and  s-  1  <  s,  contradicting  the  assumption
          n                                         n

that s = sup A.

Thus we must have s2 = 2. However, this is impossible in light of the follow-

ing proposition. Hence we must conclude that A does not have a supremum.

Proposition 1.3.2. There does not exist a rational number s with the property
that s2 = 2.

Proof. Suppose there exists s  Q such that s2 = 2. Choose a, b  Z+ so that a
and b are relatively prime (that is, they have no factor other than 1 in common)
and s = ab . Then

                                               a2
                                               b2 = 2,

so a2 = 2b2. Thus a2, and hence a, is an even integer. So there exists c  Z+
such that a = 2c. Hence

                                          2b2 = a2 = 4c2,

from which it follows that b2 = 2c, and so b is also an even integer. But this

contradicts the assumption that a and b are relatively prime.                     Q.E.D.

Exercise 1.3.10. Show that there does not exist a rational number s with the
property that s2 = 3.

Exercise 1.3.11. Show that there does not exist a rational number s with the
property that s2 = 6.

Exercise 1.3.12. Let A = {a : a  Q, a3 < 2}.
1. Show that if a  A and b < a, then b  A.

2. Show that if a / A, and b > a, then b / A.

1.3.4 Sequences

Definition 1.3.2. Suppose n  Z, I = {n, n + 1, n + 2, . . .}, and A is a set. We
call a function  : I  A a sequence with values in A.

    Frequently, we will define a sequence  by specifying its values with notation

such as, for example, {(i)}iI , or {(i)} i=n. Thus, for example, {i2} i=1 de-
notes the sequence  : Z+  Z defined by (i) = i2. Moreover, it is customary
to denote the values of a sequence using subscript notation. Thus if ai = (i),

i  I, then {ai}iI denotes the sequence . For example, we may define the
sequence of the previous example by writing ai = i2, i = 1, 2, 3, . . ..

Definition 1.3.3. Suppose {ai}iI is a sequence with values in Q. We say that
{ai}iI converges, and has limit L, L  Q, if for every  Q+, there exists

N  Z such that

                |ai - L| < whenever i > N.                (1.3.20)

    If the sequence {ai}iI converges to L, we write

                                   lim ai = L.            (1.3.21)

                                   i

Example 1.3.3. We have                  1
since, for any rational number    lim = 0,
                                 i i
                                > 0,

                                1 -0 = 1 <
                                i   i

for any i > N , where N is any integer larger than 1 .

Definition 1.3.4. Suppose {ai}iI is a sequence with values in Q. We call
{ai}iI a Cauchy sequence if for every  Q+, there exists N  Z such that

    |ai - ak| < whenever both i > N and k > N.            (1.3.22)

Proposition 1.3.3. If {ai}iI converges, then {ai}iI is a Cauchy sequence.
Proof. Suppose lim ai = L. Given  Q+, choose an integer N such that

                                i

                                            |ai - L| < 2  (1.3.23)
for all i > N . Then for any i, k > N , we have

|ai - ak| = |(ai - L) + (L - ak)|  |ai - L| + |ak - L| < 2 + 2 = . (1.3.24)

Hence {ai}iI is a Cauchy sequence.                        Q.E.D.

    The proposition shows that every convergent sequence in Q is a Cauchy
sequence, but, as the next example shows, the converse does not hold.
1.3. RATIONAL NUMBERS                                   11

Example 1.3.4. Let

                           f (x) = x2 - 2

and consider the sequence constructed as follows: Begin by setting a1 = 1,
b1 = 2, and x1 = 32 . If f (a1)f (x1) < 0, set

                           x2 = a1 + x1 ,
                                      2

a2 = a1, and b2 = x1; otherwise, set

                           x2 = x1 + b1 ,
                                      2

a2 = x1, and b2 = b1. In general, given an, xn, and bn, if f (an)f (xn) < 0, set

                           xn+1 = an + xn ,
                                          2

an+1 = an, and bn+1 = xn; otherwise, set

                           xn+1 = xn + bn ,
                                          2

an+1 = xn, and bn+1 = bn. Note that for any positive integer N , f (aN ) < 0,
f (bN ) > 0, and

                                           aN < xi < bN

for all i > N . Moreover,                     1
so                         |bN - aN | = N-1 ,

                                            2
                                              1

                            |xi - xk| < N-1
                                           2

for all i, k > N . Hence given any  Q+, if we choose an integer N such that
2N-1 > 1 , then

                                                        1
                                      |xi - xk| < N-1 <

                                                     2

for all i, k > N , showing that {xi} i=1 is a Cauchy sequence. Now suppose
{xi} i=1 converges to s  Q. Note that we must have

                           ai  s  bi

for all i  Z+. If f (s) < 0, then, since the set {a : a  Q+, a2 < 2} does not
have a supremum, there exists t  Q+ such that s < t and f (t) < 0. If we

choose N so that             1 < t - s,
                           2N -1

then                                                1
                  |s - bN |  |aN - bN | = N-1 < t - s.

                                                 2
12                              CHAPTER 1. FUNDAMENTALS

Hence bN < t, which implies that f (bN ) < 0, contradicting the construction
of {bi} i=1. Hence we must have f (s) > 0. But if f (s) > 0, then there exists
t  Q+ such that t < s and f (t) > 0. We can then choose N so that t < aN ,
implying that f (aN ) > 0, contradicting the construction of {ai} i=1. Hence we
must have f (s) = 0, which is not possible since s  Q. Thus we must conclude
that {xi} i=1 does not converge.

1.4 Real Numbers

Let C be the set of all Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. We define a

relation on C as follows: If {ai}iI and {bj}jJ are Cauchy sequences in Q,
then {ai}iI  {bj}jJ , which we will write more simply as ai  bi, if for every

rational number > 0, there exists an integer N such that

                             |ai - bi| <                               (1.4.1)

whenever i > N . This relation is clearly reflexive and symmetric. To show

that it is also transitive, and hence an equivalence relation, suppose ai  bi and
bi  ci. Given  Q+, choose N so that

                             |ai - bi| < 2                             (1.4.2)
                                                                       (1.4.3)
for all i > N and M so that

                             |bi - ci| < 2

for all i > M . Let L be the larger of N and M . Then, for all i > L,

               |ai - ci|  |ai - bi| + |bi - ci| < 2 + 2 = .            (1.4.4)

Hence ai  ci.

Definition 1.4.1. Using the equivalence relation just defined, we call the set
of equivalence classes of C the real numbers, denoted R.

    Note that if a  Q, we may identify a with the equivalence class of the
sequence {bi} i=1 where bi = a, i = 1, 2, 3, . . ., and thus consider Q to be a
subset of R.

Exercise 1.4.1. Suppose {ai}iI and {bi}iJ are sequences in Q with

                             lim ai = lim bi.
                             i  i

Show that ai  bi.
1.4. REAL NUMBERS                                                           13

1.4.1 Field properties

Suppose {ai}iI and {bj}jJ are both Cauchy sequences of rational numbers.
Let K = I  J and define a new sequence {sk}kK by setting sk = ak + bk.
Given any rational > 0, choose integers N and M such that

                                           |ai - aj| < 2                    (1.4.5)
for all i, j > N and                                                        (1.4.6)

                                           |bi - bj| < 2
for all i, j > M . If L is the larger of N and M , then, for all i, j > L,

   |si - sj| = |(ai - aj) + (bi - bj)|  |ai - aj| + |bi - bj| < 2 + 2 = , (1.4.7)

showing that {si}kK is also a Cauchy sequence. Moreover, suppose ai  ci
and bi  di. Given  Q+, choose N so that

                                           |ai - ci| < 2                    (1.4.8)
for all i > N and choose M so that

                                           |bi - di| < 2                    (1.4.9)
for all i > M . If L is the larger of N and M , then, for all i > L,

|(ai + bi) - (ci + di)|  |ai - ci| + |bi - di| < 2 + 2 = .                  (1.4.10)

Hence ai + bi  ci + di. Thus if u, v  R, with u being the equivalence class of
{ai}iI and v being the equivalence class of {bj}jJ , then we may unambigu-
ously define u + v to be the equivalence class of {ai + bi}iK , where K = I  J.

    Suppose {ai}iI and {bj}jJ are both Cauchy sequences of rational numbers.
Let K = I  J and define a new sequence {pk}kK by setting pk = akbk. Let
B > 0 be an upper bound for the set {|ai| : i  I}  {|bj| : j  J}. Given > 0,

choose integers N and M such that

                                          |ai - aj| < 2B                    (1.4.11)
for all i, j > N and                                                        (1.4.12)

                                          |bi - bj| < 2B
for all i, j > M . If L is the larger of N and M , then, for all i, j > L,

                           |pi - pj| = |aibi - ajbj|
                                       = |aibi - aj bi + aj bi - aj bj |

                                       = |bi||ai - aj| + |aj||bi - bj|

                   <B +B                                                    (1.4.13)

14                 CHAPTER 1. FUNDAMENTALS

Hence {pk}kK is a Cauchy sequence.
    Now suppose {ci}iH and {di}iG are Cauchy sequences with ai  ci and

bi  di. Let B > 0 be an upper bound for the set {|bj| : j  J}  {|ci| : i  H}.
Given > 0, choose integers N and M such that

                   |ai - ci| < 2B                                     (1.4.14)
                                                                      (1.4.15)
for all i > N and
                                                                      (1.4.16)
                   |bi - di| < 2B

for all i > M . If L is the larger of N and M , then, for all i > L,

                   |aibi - cidi| = |aibi - bici + bici - cidi|
                                   = |bi(ai - ci) + ci(bi - di|
                                    |bi(ai - ci)| + |ci(bi - di)|
                                   = |bi||ai - ci| + |ci||bi - di|

                                   <B +B
                                         2B 2B

                                   =.

Hence aibi  cidi. Thus if u, v  R, with u being the equivalence class of {ai}iI
and v being the equivalence class of {bj}jJ , then we may unambiguously define
uv to be the equivalence class of {aibi}iK , where K = I  J.

    If u  R, we define -u = (-1)u. Note that if {ai}iI is a Cauchy sequence
of rational numbers in the equivalence class of u, then {-ai}iI is a Cauchy
sequence in the equivalence class of -u.

    We will say that a sequence {ai}iI is bounded away from 0 if there exists
a rational number  > 0 and an integer N such that |ai| >  for all i > N . It
should be clear that any sequence which converges to 0 is not bounded away

from 0. Moreover, as a consequence of the next exercise, any Cauchy sequence

which does not converge to 0 must be bounded away from 0.

Exercise 1.4.2. Suppose {ai}iI is a Cauchy sequence which is not bounded
away from 0. Show that the sequence converges and lim ai = 0.

                                                                                                    i

Exercise 1.4.3. Suppose {ai}iI is a Cauchy sequence which is bounded away
from 0 and ai  bi. Show that {bj}jJ is also bounded away from 0.

    Now suppose {ai}iI is a Cauchy sequence which is bounded away from 0

and choose  > 0 and N so that |ai| >  for all i > N . Define a new sequence
{ci} i=N+1 by setting

                          1                                           (1.4.17)
                   ci = ai , i = N + 1, N + 2, . . . .
1.4. REAL NUMBERS                                                                                 15

Given > 0, choose M so that

                                           |ai - aj| < 2                                   (1.4.18)

for all i, j > M . Let L be the larger of N and M . Then, for all i, j > L, we
have

                                       |ci - cj| = 1 - 1                                   (1.4.19)
                                                      ai aj

                                                  = aj - ai
                                                        aiaj

                                                  = |aj - ai|
                                                       |aiaj |
                                                      2

                                                  < 2
                                                  =.

Hence {ci} i=N+1 is a Cauchy sequence.
    Now suppose {bj}jJ is a Cauchy sequence with ai  bi. By Exercise 1.4.3

we know that {bj}jJ is also bounded away from 0, so choose  > 0 and K such

that |bj| >  for all j > K. Given > 0, choose P so that

                                           |ai - bi| < .                                   (1.4.20)

for all i > P . Let S be the larger of N , K, and P . Then, for all i, j > S, we
have

                                       1-1          = bi - ai
                                       ai bi              aibi

                                                    = |bi - ai|                            (1.4.21)
                                                         |aibi|
                                                        

                                                    <
                                                        

                                                    =.

Hence  1     bi1 .  Thus  if  u  =  0  is  a  real  number    which  is  the  equivalence  class  of
       ai
{ai}iI (necessarily bounded away from 0), then we may define

                                              a-1 = 1                                      (1.4.22)
                                                       a

to be the equivalence class of

                                              1                                            (1.4.23)
                                                           ,

                                              ai i=N +1

where N has been chosen so that |ai| >  for all i > N and some  > 0.
    It follows immediately from these definitions that R is a field. That is:
16  CHAPTER 1. FUNDAMENTALS

1. a + b = b + a for all a, b  R;
2. (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all a, b, c  R;

4. (ab)c = a(bc) for all a, b, c  R;
5. a(b + c) = ab + ac for all a, b, c  R;
6. a + 0 = a for all a  R;
7. a + (-a) = 0 for all a  R;
8. 1a = a for all a  R;
9. if a  R, a = 0, then aa-1 = 1.

1.4.2 Order and metric properties

Definition 1.4.2. Given u  R, we say that u is positive, written u > 0, if u
is the equivalence class of a Cauchy sequence {ai}iI for which there exists a
rational number > 0 and an integer N such that ai > for every i > N . A
real number u  R is said to be negative if -u > 0. We let R+ denote the set
of all positive real numbers.

Exercise 1.4.4. Show that if u  R, then one and only one of the following is
true: (a) u > 0, (b) u < 0, or (c) u = 0.

Exercise 1.4.5. Show that if a, b  R+, then a + b  R+.

Definition 1.4.3. Given real numbers u and v, we say u is greater than v,
written u > v, or, equivalently, v is less than u, written, v < u, if u - v > 0. We
write u  v, or, equivalently, v  u, to indicate that u is either greater than or
equal to v. We say that u is nonnegative if u  0.

Exercise 1.4.6. Show that R is an ordered field, that is, verify the following:
a. For any a, b  R, one and only one of the following must hold: (i) a < b, (ii)

     a = b, (iii) a > b.

b. If a, b, c  R with a < b and b < c, then a < c.
c. If a, b, c  R with a < b, then a + c < b + c.
d. If a, b  R with a > 0 and b > 0, then ab > 0.
Exercise 1.4.7. Show that if a, b  R with a > 0 and b < 0, then ab < 0.
1.4. REAL NUMBERS                                                      17

Exercise 1.4.8. Show that if a, b, c  R with a < b, then ac < bc if c > 0 and
ac > bc if c < 0.

Exercise 1.4.9. Show that if a, b  R with a < b, then for any real number 
with 0 <  < 1, a < a + (1 - )b < b.

Definition 1.4.4. For any a  R, we call                                (1.4.24)
                                     |a| = a, if a  0,
                                               -a, if a < 0,

the absolute value of a.

Exercise 1.4.10. Show that for any a  R, -|a|  a  |a|.

Proposition 1.4.1. For any a, b  R, |a + b|  |a| + |b|.
Proof. If a + b  0, then

|a| + |b| - |a + b| = |a| + |b| - a - b = (|a| - a) + (|b| - b).       (1.4.25)

Both of the terms on the right are nonnegative by Exercise 1.4.10. Hence the
sum is nonnegative and the proposition follows. If a + b < 0, then

|a| + |b| - |a + b| = |a| + |b| + a + b = (|a| + a) + (|b| + b).       (1.4.26)

Again, both of the terms on the right are nonnegative by Exercise 1.4.10. Hence

the sum is nonnegative and the proposition follows.                    Q.E.D.

It is now easy to show that the absolute value function satisfies

1. |a - b|  0 for all a, b  R, with |a - b| = 0 if and only if a = b,
2. |a - b| = |b - a| for all a, b  R,
3. |a - b|  |a - c| + |c - b| for all a, b, c  R.
These properties show that the function

                   d(a, b) = |a - b|                                   (1.4.27)

is a metric, and we will call |a - b| the distance from a to b.
Proposition 1.4.2. Given a  R+, there exist r, s  Q such that 0 < r < a < s.
18                            CHAPTER 1. FUNDAMENTALS

Proof. Let {u}iI be a Cauchy sequence in the equivalence class of a. Since

a > 0, there exists a rational > 0 and an integer N such that ui > for all

i > N . Let r = 2 . Then ui - r > 2 for every i > N , so a - r > 0, that is,
0 < r < a.

    Now choose an integer M so that |ui - uj| < 1 for all i, j > M . Let

s = uM+1 + 2. Then

                    s - ui = uM+1 + 2 - ui > 1                     (1.4.28)

for all i > M . Hence s > a.                                       Q.E.D.

Proposition 1.4.3. R is an archimedean ordered field.

Proof. Given real numbers a and b with 0 < a < b, let r and s be rational
numbers for which 0 < r < a < b < s. Since Q is a an archimedean field, there
exists an integer n such that nr > s. Hence

                              na > nr > s > b.                     (1.4.29)

                                                                                                         Q.E.D.

Proposition 1.4.4. Given a, b  R with a < b, there exists r  Q such that
a < r < b.

Proof. Let {u}iI be a Cauchy sequence in the equivalence class of a and let
{v}jJ be in the equivalence class of b. Since b - a > 0, there exists a rational

  > 0 and an integer N such that vi - ui > for all i > N . Now choose an
integer M so that |ui - uj| < 4 for all i, j > M . Let r = uM+1 + 2 . Then

                    r - ui = uM+1 + 2 - ui                         (1.4.30)
                            = 2 - (ui - uM+1)
                            >2-4
                            =
                                4

for all i > M and

                           vi - r = vi - uM+1 - 2                  (1.4.31)
                                    = (vi - ui) - (uM+1 - ui) - 2  Q.E.D.
                                    > -4-2
                                    =
                                       4

for all i larger than the larger of N and M . Hence a < r < b.

1.4.3 Upper and lower bounds

Definition 1.4.5. Let A  R. If s  R is such that s  a for every a  A, then
we call s an upper bound for A. If s is an upper bound for A with the property

that s  t whenever t is an upper bound for A, then we call s the supremum,
or least upper bound , of A, denoted s = sup A. Similarly, if r  R is such that
r  a for every a  A, then we call r a lower bound for A. If r is a lower bound
for A with the property that r  t whenever t is a lower bound for A, then we

call r the infimum, or greatest lower bound , of A, denoted r = inf A.

Theorem 1.4.5. Suppose A  R, A = , has an upper bound. Then sup A
exists.

Proof. Let a  A and let b be an upper bound for A. Define sequences {ai} i=1
and {bi} i=1 as follows: Let a1 = a and b1 = b. For i > 1, let

                               c = ai-1 + bi-1 .          (1.4.32)
                                           2

If c is an upper bound for A, let ai = ai-1 and let bi = c; otherwise, let ai = c

and bi = bi-1. Then

                               |bi - ai| = 2i-1 |b - a|   (1.4.33)

for i = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Now, for i = 1, 2, 3, . . ., let ri be a rational number such that

ai < ri < bi. Given any > 0, we may choose N so that

                               2N > |b - a| .             (1.4.34)

Then, whenever i > N and j > N ,

              |ri - rj| < |bN+1 - aN+1| = 2N |b - a| < .  (1.4.35)

Hence {ri} i=1 is a Cauchy sequence. Let s  R be the equivalence class of
{ri} i=1. Note that, for i = 1, 2, 3, . . ., ai  s  bi.

    Now if s is not an upper bound for A, then there exists a  A with a > s.

Let  = a - s and choose an integer N such that

                               2N > |b - a| .             (1.4.36)
                                          

Then                 bN+1  s + 2N |b - a| < s +  = a.

But, by construction, bN+1 is an upper bound for A. Thus s must be an upper

bound for A.

Now suppose t is another upper bound for A and t < s. Let  = s - t and

choose an integer N such that

                               2N > |b - a| .             (1.4.38)

Then                 aN+1  s - 2N |b - a| > s -  = t,

                                                       (1.4.39)

which implies that aN+1 is an upper bound for A. But, by construction, aN+1
is not an upper bound for A. Hence s must be the least upper bound for A,

that is, s = sup A.                                    Q.E.D.

Exercise 1.4.11. Show that if A  R is nonempty and has a lower bound, then
inf A exists. (Hint: You may wish to first show that inf A = - sup(-A), where

-A = {x : -x  A}).

Sequences and Series

2.1 Sequences

Definition 2.1.1. Let {ai}iI be a sequence of real numbers. We say {ai}iI

converges, and has limit L, if for every real number > 0 there exists an integer

N such that

                         |ai - L| < whenever i > N.         (2.1.1)

We say a sequence {ai}iI which does not converge diverges.

Definition 2.1.2. We say a sequence {ai}iI is nondecreasing if ai+1  ai for
every i  I and increasing if ai+1 > ai for every i  I. We say a sequence
{ai}iI is nonincreasing if ai+1  ai for every i  I and decreasing if ai+1 < ai
for every i  I.

Definition 2.1.3. We say a set A  R is bounded if there exists a real number
M such that |a|  M for every a  A. We say a sequence {ai}iI of real

numbers is bounded if there exists a real number M such that |ai|  M for all

i  I.

Theorem 2.1.1. If {ai}iI is a nondecreasing, bounded sequence of real num-
bers, then {ai}iI converges.

Proof. Since {ai}iI is bounded, the set of A = {ai : i  I} has a supremum.
Let L = sup A. For any > 0, there must exist N  I such that aN > L - (or
else L - would be an upper bound for A which is smaller than L). But then

                         L - < aN  ai  L < L +              (2.1.2)

for all i  N , that is,

                         |ai - L| <                         (2.1.3)

for all i  N . Thus {ai}iI converges and

                         L = lim ai.                        (2.1.4)

    We conclude from the previous theorem that every nondecreasing sequence
of real numbers either has a limit or is not bounded, that is, is unbounded.

Exercise 2.1.1. Show that a nonincreasing, bounded sequence of real numbers
must converge.

Definition 2.1.4. Let {ai}iI be a sequence of real numbers. If for every real
number M there exists an integer N such that ai > M whenever i > N , then
we say the sequence {ai}iI diverges to positive infinity, denoted by

                           lim ai = +.                      (2.1.5)

                           i

Similarly, if for every real number M there exists an integer N such that ai < M

whenever i > N , then we say the sequence {ai}iI diverges to negative infinity,

denoted by

                           lim ai = -.                      (2.1.6)

                           i

Exercise 2.1.2. Show that a nondecreasing sequence of real numbers either
converges or diverges to positive infinity.

Exercise 2.1.3. Show that a nonincreasing sequence of real numbers either
converges or diverges to negative infinity.

2.1.1 Extended real numbers

It is convenient to add the symbols + and - to the real numbers R. Al-
though neither + nor - is a real number, we agree to the following opera-
tional conventions:

1. Given any real number r, - < r < .

2. For any real number r,

            r + (+) = r - (-) = r +  = +,                   (2.1.7)

                            r + (-) = r - (+) = r -  = -,   (2.1.8)
     and r r                                                (2.1.9)

                                           + = - = 0.
3. For any real number r > 0, r · (+) = + and r · (-) = -.
4. For any real number r < 0, r · (+) = - and r · (-) = +.
2.1. SEQUENCES                                                                  23

5. If ai = -, i = 1, 2, 3, . . ., then lim ai = -.

                                                                    i

6. If ai = +, i = 1, 2, 3, . . ., then lim ai = +.

                                                                    i

    Note that with the order relation defined in this manner, + is an upper
bound and - is a lower bound for any set A  R. Thus if A  R does not
have a finite upper bound, then sup A = +; similarly, if A  R does not have
a finite lower bound, then inf A = -.

    When working with extended real numbers, we refer to the elements of R as
finite real numbers and the elements + and - as infinite real numbers.

Exercise 2.1.4. Do the extended real numbers form a field?

2.1.2 Limit superior and inferior

Definition 2.1.5. Let {ai}iI be a sequence of real numbers and, for each
i  I, let ui = sup{aj : j  i}. If ui = + for every i  I, we let

                   lim sup ai = +;                          (2.1.10)

                     i

otherwise, we let

                   lim sup ai = inf{ui : i  I}.             (2.1.11)

                     i

In either case, we call lim sup an the limit superior of the sequence {ai}iI .

                                            n

Definition 2.1.6. Let {ai}iI be a sequence of real numbers and, for each
i  I, let li = inf{aj : j  i}. If li = - for every i  I, we let

                   lim inf ai = -;                          (2.1.12)

                    i

otherwise, we let

                   lim inf ai = sup{li : i  I}.             (2.1.13)

                    i

In either case, we call lim inf an the limit inferior of the sequence {ai}iI .

                           lim ai = lim bi,                                   (2.1.16)
                           i          i

then

                        lim ci = lim ai = lim bi.                             (2.1.17)

Proof. Let L = lim ai = lim bi. Suppose L is finite. Given     > 0, there exists

an integer M such that

and
                                            |bi - L| < 3

whenever i > M . Then

               |ai - bi|  |ai - L| + |L - bi| < + = 2                         (2.1.20)
                                                         33 3

whenever i > M . Let K be the larger of N and M . Then

    |ci - L|  |ci - bi| + |bi - L|  |ai - bi| + |bi - L| < 2 + =              (2.1.21)

Proposition 2.1.3. Suppose {ai}iI is a sequence for which

                          lim sup ai = lim inf ai.               (2.1.24)
                                    i
                          i

Then

                       lim ai = lim sup ai = lim inf ai.         (2.1.25)
                       i                         i
                                 i

Proof. Let ui = sup{ak : k  i} and li = inf{ak : k  i}. Then li  ai  ui
for all i  I. Now

                     lim li = lim inf ai = lim sup ai = lim ui,  (2.1.26)

so the result follows from the squeeze theorem.

Exercise 2.1.11. Suppose u is a real number such that u  0 and u < for
any real number > 0. Show that u = 0.

2.1.3 Completeness

Definition 2.1.7. Suppose {ai}iI is a sequence in R. We call {ai}iI a Cauchy
sequence if for every > 0 there exists an integer N such that

                          |ai - aj| <                            (2.1.27)

whenever both i > N and j > N .

Theorem 2.1.4. Suppose {ai}iI is a Cauchy sequence in R. Then {ai}iI
converges to a limit L  R.

Proof. Let ui = sup{ak : k  i} and li = inf{ak : k  i}. Given any > 0,

there exists N  Z such that |ai - aj| < for all i, j > N . Thus, for all i, j > N ,

ai < aj + , and so

                       ai  inf{aj + : j  i} = li +               (2.1.28)
26                               CHAPTER 2. SEQUENCES AND SERIES

for all i > N . Since {li}iI is a nondecreasing sequence,

                       ai  sup{li + : i  I} = lim inf ai +                  (2.1.29)

                                                                         i

for all i > N . Hence

                       ui = sup{ak : k  i}  lim inf ai +                    (2.1.30)

                                                                    i

for all i > N . Thus

       lim sup ai = inf{ui : i  I}  lim inf ai + .                          (2.1.31)
                                                         i
                      i

Since lim inf ai  lim sup ai, it follows that
    i
       i

                         | lim sup ai - lim inf ai|  .                      (2.1.32)
                                 i
                         i

Since this is true for every > 0, we have lim sup ai = lim inf ai, and so {ai}iI
                                                            i
                                               i

converges by Proposition 2.1.3.                                             Q.E.D.

    As a consequence of the previous theorem, we say that R is a complete metric
space.

Exercise 2.1.12. Suppose A  R, A = , and s = sup A. Show that there
exists a sequence {ai} i=1 with ai  A such that lim ai = s.

Exercise 2.1.13. Given a real number x  0, show that there exists a real
number s  0 such that s2 = x.

              
    We let x denote the number s in the previous exercise, the square root of
x.

2.1.4 Some basic results about sequences

Proposition 2.1.5. Suppose {xi}iI is a convergent sequence in R,  is a real
number, and L = lim xi. Then the sequence {xi}iI converges and

                                  i

                                 lim xi = L.                                (2.1.33)

                                 i

Proof. If  = 0, then {xi}iI clearly converges to 0. So assume  = 0. Given
  > 0, choose an integer N such that

                                          |xi - L| < ||                     (2.1.34)
whenever i > N . Then for any i > N we have

                           |xi - L| = |||xi - L| < || || = .                (2.1.35)
Thus lim xi = L.                                                            Q.E.D.

Proposition 2.1.8. Suppose {xi}iI and {yi}iI are convergent sequences in

R with L = lim xi, M = lim yi, and yi = 0 for all i  I. If M = 0, then the

Proposition 2.1.10. If x  R and |x| < 1, then

                                                  lim xn = 0.                        (2.1.50)

                                                 n

Proof. We first assume x  0. Then the sequence {xn} n=1 is nonincreasing and
bounded below by 0. Hence the sequence converges. Let L = lim xn. Then

                                                                                                                     n

2.1.5 Subsequences

Definition 2.1.8. Given a sequence {xi} i=m, suppose {nk} k=1 is an increasing
sequence of integers with

                                    m  n1 < n2 < n3 < · · · .                        (2.1.52)

Then  we  call       the  sequence  {x  n  k  }       a  subsequence  of  {xi} i=m.
                                                 k=1

Example 2.1.2. The sequence {x2k} k=1 is a subsequence of the sequence
{xi}i=1  . For example, 2i i=1 1  is a subsequence of i i=1 1  .

Exercise 2.1.22. Suppose {xi} i=m converges with lim xi = L. Show that

                                                                                                      i

every subsequence {xnk } k=1 of {xi} i=m also converges and lim xnk = L.

                                                                                                                 k

Exercise 2.1.23. Suppose {xi} i=m diverges to +. Show that every subse-
                              {xi} i=m
quence  {x  n  k  }  k=1  of            also     diverges  to  +.

Exercise 2.1.24. Suppose {xi} i=m diverges to -. Show that every subse-
                              {xi} i=m
quence  {x  n  k  }  k=1  of            also     diverges  to  -.

Definition 2.1.9. Given a sequence {xi} i=m, we call any extended real number
 which is the limit of a subsequence of {xi} i=m a subsequential limit of {xi} i=m.
Example 2.1.3. -1 and 1 are both subsequential limits of {(-1)i} i=0.
2.1. SEQUENCES                                                                               31

Exercise 2.1.25. Suppose the sequence {xi} i=m is not bounded. Show that
either - or + is a subsequential limit of {xi} i=m.

Proposition 2.1.11. Suppose  is the set of all subsequential limits of the
sequence {xi} i=m. Then  = .

Proof. By the previous exercise, the proposition is true if {xi} i=m is not
bounded. So suppose {xi} i=m is bounded and choose real numbers a and b
such that a  xi  b for all i  m. Construct sequences {ai} i=1 and {bi} i=1 as
follows: Let a1 = a and b1 = b. For i  1, let

                                 c = ai-1 + bi-1 .                              (2.1.53)
                                             2

If there exists an integer N such that ai-1  xj  c for all j > N , let ai = ai-1

and bi = c; otherwise, let ai = c and bi = bi-1. Let n1 = m and, for k =

2, 3, 4, . . ., let nk be the smallest integer for which nk > nk-1 and ak  xnk  bk.

Then {xnk } k=1 is a Cauchy sequence which is a subsequence of {xi} i=m. Thus
{xnk } k=1 converges and  = .
                                                                                Q.E.D.

Exercise 2.1.26. Suppose A  R and B  R with a  b for every a  A and
b  B. Show that sup A  inf B.

Proposition 2.1.12. Let  be the set of subsequential limits of a sequence

{xi} i=m. Then

                                 lim sup xi = sup .                             (2.1.54)

                                 i

Proof. Let s = sup  and, for i  m, ui = sup{xj : j  i}. Now since xj  ui

for all j  i, it follows that   ui for every    and i  m. Hence, from the

previous exercise, s  inf{ui : i  m} = lim sup xi.

                                           i

Now suppose s < lim sup xi. Then there exists a real number t such that

                         i

s < t < lim sup xi. In particular, t < ui for every i  m. Let n1 be the smallest

         i

integer for which n1  m and xn1 > t. For k = 2, 3, 4, . . ., let nk be the smallest

integer  for  which  nk  > nk-1  and  xnk  > t.  Then  {x  n  k  }       is  a  subsequence  of
                                                                    k=1
{xi} i=m which has a subsequential limit   t. Since  is also then a subsequen-
tial limit of {xi} i=m, we have    and   t > s, contradicting s = sup .

Hence we must have lim sup xi = sup .                                           Q.E.D.

                                        i=m

We call the sequence {sn} n=m an infinite series. If {sn} n=m converges, we call

                                   i=m

to denote either {sn} n=m, the infinite series, or s, the sum of the infinite series.

                                                                                      

Of course, if {sn} n=m diverges, then we say ai diverges.

Proof. Let sn = ai and s = lim sn. Since an = sn - sn-1, we have

Exercise 2.2.4. Let s = (-1)n. Note that

                                                 i=0

                                   

       s = (-1)n = 1 - (-1)n = 1 - s,

            n=0                  n=0

from which it follows that s = 12 . Is this correct?

Exercise 2.2.5. Show that for any real number x = 1,

(Hint: Note that xn+1 = sn+1 - sn = 1 + xsn - sn.)

Proof. If sn = xi, then, by the previous exercise,

                              i=0

2.2.1 Comparison tests

The following two propositions are together referred to as the comparison test.
34                            CHAPTER 2. SEQUENCES AND SERIES

                              

Proposition 2.2.3. Suppose ai and bi are infinite series for which there

                         i=m  i=k

                                                                                        

exists an integer N such that 0  ai  bi whenever i  N . If bi converges,

                                                                                                                 i=k
      

then ai converges.

      i=m

                                                 

Proof. By Exercise 2.2.3 We need only show that ai converges. Let sn be

                                                 i=N                                                                    

the nth partial sum of ai and let tn be the nth partial sum of bi. Now

                    i=N                                                                                               i=N

                         sn+1 - sn = an+1  0                                                                                 (2.2.8)

for every n  N , so {sn} n=N is a nondecreasing sequence. Moreover,

                                                                                                                             (2.2.9)

                         sn  tn  bi < +

                                            i=N

for every n  N . Thus {sn} n=N is a nondecreasing, bounded sequence, and so

converges.                                                                                                                   Q.E.D.

                              

Proposition 2.2.4. Suppose ai and bi are infinite series for which there

                         i=m  i=k

                                                                                        

exists an integer N such that 0  ai  bi whenever i  N . If ai diverges,

                                                                                                                   i=k
      

then bi diverges.

      i=m

                                                 

Proof. By Exercise 2.2.3 we need only show that bi diverges. Let sn be

                                                 i=N                                                                    

the nth partial sum of ai and let tn be the nth partial sum of bi. Now

                    i=N                                                                                                 i=N
{sn} n=N is a nondecreasing sequence which diverges, and so we must have

 lim sn = +. Thus given any real number M there exists an integer L such

n

that

                           M < sn  tn                                                                                        (2.2.10)

                                                                                                                             Q.E.D.

whenever n > L. Hence lim tn = + and bi diverges.

                                      n=1

exists an integer N and a real number M > 0 such that 0  ai  M bi whenever

                            i=m        i=k

exists an integer N and a real number M > 0 such that 0  ai  M bi whenever

                    

i  N . If ai diverges, then i=k  bi diverges.

i=m

Proof. By the comparison test,              diverges.  Hence, by the previous
                                                                               Q.E.D.
                                      M bi

exercise, bi also diverges.      i=m

                 i=m

    We call the results of the next two exercises, which are direct consequences
of the last two propositions, the limit comparison test.

                                     

Exercise 2.2.7. Suppose ai and bi are infinite series for which ai  0

                      i=m            i=m
                                       

and bi > 0 for all i  m. Show that if bi converges and

                                     i=m

                            lim ai < +,                 (2.2.14)
                            i bi

           

then ai converges.

         i=m

                                     

Exercise 2.2.8. Suppose ai and bi are infinite series for which ai  0

                      i=m            i=m
                                       

and bi > 0 for all i  m. Show that if ai diverges and

                                     i=m

                            lim ai < +,                 (2.2.15)
                            i bi

           

then bi diverges.

         i=m

Exercise 2.2.9. Show that         1
converges.                            n2n

                                 n=1

Exercise 2.2.10. Show that        xn

                                 n=0 n!

converges for any real number x  0.
38                    CHAPTER 2. SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Exercise 2.2.11. Let S be the set of all finite sums of numbers in the set
{a1, a2, a3, . . .}, where ai  0 for i = 1, 2, 3, . . .. That is

         S=      ai : J  {1, 2, 3, . . . , n} for some n  Z+ .

             iJ

                      

Show that ai converges if and only if sup S < , in which case

                     i=1

                  

                     ai = sup S.

                 i=1

    One consequence of the preceding exercise is that the sum of a sequence of

nonnegative numbers depends only on the numbers begin added, and not on

the order in which they are added. That is, if  : Z+  Z+ is one-to-one and
                      

onto, ai converges if and only if a(i) converges, and, in that case,

    i=1               i=1

                           

                      ai = a(i).

3.1 Binary representations

Suppose {an} n=1 is a sequence such that, for each n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., either an = 0

or an = 1 and, for any integer N , there exists an integer n > N such that

an = 0. Then  0  2n an  2n 1

                                                                          (3.1.1)

for n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., so the infinite series

                an                                                        (3.1.2)
                   2n

              n=1

converges to some real number x by the comparison test. Moreover,

                          1                                               (3.1.3)
              0  x < 2n = 1.

                              n=1

We call the sequence {an} n=1 the binary representation for x, and write

              x = .a1a2a3a4 . . . .                                       (3.1.4)

Exercise 3.1.1. Suppose {an} n=1 and {bn} n=1 are both binary representations
for x. Show that an = bn for n = 1, 2, 3, . . ..

    Now suppose x  R with 0  x < 1. Construct a sequence {an} n=1 as
follows: If 0  x < 12 , let a1 = 0; otherwise, let a1 = 1. For n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., let

                                                      n=1

Proof. Given           >  0,    choose    an  integer  N   such     that   1  <  .  Then, for any

an integer n > N such that an = 0.

Proof. If an = 1 for n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., then

                        1                                             (3.1.14)
                  x = 2n = 1,

                          n=1

contradicting the assumption that 0  x < 1. Now suppose there exists an
integer N such that aN = 0 but an = 1 for every n > N . Then

x = sN +          2n = sN-1 +                  2n = sN-1 + 2N ,       (3.1.15)

          n=N +1               n=N +1

implying that aN = 1, and thus contradicting the assumption that aN = 0.

    Combining the previous lemma with the previous proposition yields the fol-
lowing result.

Proposition 3.1.4. With the notation as above, x = .a1a2a3a4 . . . .

    The next theorem now follows from Exercise 3.1.1 and the previous propo-
sition.

Theorem 3.1.5. Every real number 0  x < 1 has a unique binary represen-
tation.

3.2 Countable and uncountable sets

Definition 3.2.1. A function  : A  B is said to be a one-to-one correspon-
dence if  is both one-to-one and onto.
Definition 3.2.2. We say sets A and B have the same cardinality if there exists
a one-to-one correspondence  : A  B.

    We denote the fact that A and B have the same cardinality by writing
|A| = |B|.

Exercise 3.2.1. Define a relation on sets by setting A  B if and only if
|A| = |B|. Show that this relation is an equivalence relation.

Definition 3.2.3. Let A be a set. If, for n  Z+, A has the cardinality of the
set {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}, we say A is finite and write |A| = n. If A has the cardinality

of Z+, we say A is countable and write |A| = 0.

Example 3.2.1. If we define  : Z+  Z by
                  
                  n - 1
                               , if n is odd,
          (n) = 2
                  - n , if n is even,                                 (3.2.1)

                    2

then  is a one-to-one correspondence. Thus |Z| = 0.
42                        CHAPTER 3. CARDINALITY

Exercise 3.2.2. Let A be the set of even integers. Show that |A| = 0.
Exercise 3.2.3. Verify each of the following:
a. If A is a nonempty subset of Z+, then A is either finite or countable.
b. If A is a nonempty subset of a countable set B, then A is either finite or

     countable.

Proposition 3.2.1. Suppose A and B are countable sets. Then the set C =
A  B is countable.

Proof. Suppose A and B are disjoint, that is, A  B = . Let  : Z+  A and
 : Z+  B be one-to-one correspondences. Define  : Z+  C by

     (n) =   n+1 2 ,      if n is odd,   (3.2.2)
             n2 ,         if n is even.

Then  is a one-to-one correspondence, showing that C is countable.

    If A and B are not disjoint, then  is onto but not one-to-one. However, in
that case C has the cardinality of an infinite subset of Z+, and so is countable.

                                                                                                         Q.E.D.

Definition 3.2.4. A nonempty set which is not finite is said to be infinite. An
infinite set which is not countable is said to be uncountable.

Exercise 3.2.4. Suppose A is uncountable and B  A is countable. Show that
A \ B is uncountable.

Proposition 3.2.2. Suppose A and B are countable. Then C = A × B is
countable.

Proof. Let  : Z+  A and  : Z+  B be one-to-one correspondences. Let
ai = (i) and bi = (i). Define  : Z+  C by letting

             (1) = (a1, b1),              (3.2.3)
                                          (3.2.4)

             (4) = (a1, b3),              (3.2.9)

             (5) = (a2, b2),             (3.2.10)

             (6) = (a3, b1),

             (7) = (a1, b4),

            ...=.     ..

That is, form the infinite matrix with (ai, bj) in the ith row and jth column,

and then count the entries by reading down the diagonals from right to left.

Then  is a one-to-one correspondence and C is countable.                   Q.E.D.

Proposition 3.2.3. Q is countable.
Proof. By the previous proposition, Z × Z is countable. Let

A = {(p, q) : p, q  Z, q > 0, p and q relatively prime}.                   (3.2.11)

Then A is infinite and A  Z × Z, so A is countable. But clearly |Q| = |A|, so

Q is countable.                                                            Q.E.D.

Proposition 3.2.4. Suppose for each i  Z+, Ai is countable. Then

                                                                           (3.2.12)

                 B = Ai

                          i=1

is countable.

Proof. Suppose the sets Ai, i  Z+, are pairwise disjoint, that is, AiAj =  for
all i, j  Z+. For each i  Z+, let i : Z+  Ai be a one-to-one correspondence.
Then  : Z+ × Z+  B defined by

                 (i, j) = i(j)                                             (3.2.13)

is a one-to-one correspondence, and so |B| = |Z+ × Z+| = 0.
    If the sets Ai, i  Z+, are not disjoint, then  is onto but not one-to-one.

But then there exists a subset P of Z+ ×Z+ such that  : P  B is a one-to-one

correspondence. Since P is an infinite subset of a countable set, P is countable

and so |B| = 0.                                                            Q.E.D.

    If in the previous proposition we allow that, for each i  Z+, Ai is either
finite or countable, then B = i=1  Ai will be either finite or countable.

3.3 Power sets

Definition 3.3.1. Given a set A, we call the set of all subsets of A the power
set of A, which we denote P(A).

Example 3.3.1. If A = {1, 2, 3}, then

            P(A) = {, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}} .

Proposition 3.3.1. If A is finite with |A| = n, then |P(A)| = 2n.

Proof. Let

B = {(b1, b2, . . . , bn) : bi = 0 or bi = 1, i = 1, 2, . . . , n}         (3.3.1)
44                                              CHAPTER 3. CARDINALITY

and let a1, a2, . . . , an be the elements of A. Define  : B  P(A) by letting

           (b1, b2, . . . , bn) = {ai : bi = 1, i = 1, 2, . . . , n}.  (3.3.2)

Then  is a one-to-one correspondence. The result now follows from the next

exercise.                                                              Q.E.D.

Exercise 3.3.1. With B as in the previous proposition, show that |B| = 2n.

    In analogy with the case when A is finite, we let 2|A| = |P(A)| for any
nonempty set A.

Definition 3.3.2. Suppose A and B are sets for which there exists a one-to-
one function  : A  B but there does not exist a one-to-one correspondence
 : A  B. Then we write |A| < |B|.

Theorem 3.3.2. If A is a nonempty set, then |A| < |P(A)|.

Proof. Define  : A  P(A) by (a) = {a}. Then  is one-to-one. Now
suppose  : A  P(A) is any one-to-one function. Let

           C = {a : a  A, a / (a)}.                                    (3.3.3)

Suppose there exists a  A such that (a) = C. Then a  C if and only if

a / C, an obvious contradiction. Thus C is not in the range of , and so  is

not a one-to-one correspondence.                                       Q.E.D.

Lemma 3.3.3. Let A be the set of all sequences {ai} i=1 with ai = 0 or ai = 1
for each i = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Then |A| = |P(Z+)|.
Proof. Define  : A  P(Z+) by

            ({ai} i=1) = {i : i  Z+, ai = 1}.                          (3.3.4)

Then  is a one-to-one correspondence.                                  Q.E.D.

    Now let B be the set of all sequences {ai} i=1 in A such that for every integer
N there exists an integer n > N such that an = 0. Let C = A \ B,

           D0 = {{ai} i=1 : ai = 1, i = 1, 2, 3, . . .},               (3.3.5)

and

           Dj = {{ai} i=1 : aj = 0, ak = 1 for k > j}                  (3.3.6)

for j = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Then |D0| = 1 and |Dj| = 2j-1 for j = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Moreover,

                                                                       (3.3.7)

                                  C = Dj,

                                           j=0
3.3. POWER SETS                                              45

so C is countable. Since A = B  C, and A is uncountable, it follows that B is
uncountable. Now if we let

                                  I = {x : x  R, 0  x < 1},  (3.3.8)
we have seen that the function  : B  I defined by

                  ({ai} i=1) = .a1a2a3a4 . . .               (3.3.9)

is a one-to-one correspondence. It follows that I is uncountable. As a conse-
quence, we have the following result.

Theorem 3.3.4. R is uncountable.

Exercise 3.3.2. Let I = {x : x  R, 0  x < 1}. Show that
a. |I| = |{x : x  R, 0  x  1}|
b. |I| = |{x : x  R, 0 < x < 1}|
c. |I| = |{x : x  R, 0 < x < 2}|
d. |I| = |{x : x  R, -1 < x < 1}|
Exercise 3.3.3. Let I = {x : x  R, 0  x < 1} and suppose a and b are real
numbers with a < b. Show that

                                 |I| = |{x : x  R, a  x < b}|.

Exercise 3.3.4. Does there exist a set A  R for which 0 < |A| < 20 ?

4.1 Intervals

Definition 4.1.1. Given any two extended real numbers a < b, we call the set

                      (a, b) = {x : x  R, a < x < b}           (4.1.1)

an open interval . Given any two finite real numbers a  b, we call the sets

                      [a, b] = {x : x  R, a  x  b},            (4.1.2)

                      (-, b] = {x : x  R, x  b},               (4.1.3)

and

                      [a, +) = {x : x  R, x  a}                (4.1.4)

closed intervals. We call any set which is an open interval, a closed interval, or
is given by, for some finite real numbers a < b,

                      (a, b] = {x : x  R, a < x  b}            (4.1.5)
                                                               (4.1.6)
or                    [a, b) = {x : x  R, a  x < b},
an interval .                                                  (4.1.7)

Proposition 4.1.1. If a, b  R with a < b, then

               (a, b) = {x : x = a + (1 - )b, 0 <  < 1}.

Proof. Suppose x = a + (1 - )b for some 0 <  < 1. Then

                      b - x = b - a = (b - a) > 0,             (4.1.8)

so x < b. Similarly,

               x - a = ( - 1)a + (1 - )b = (1 - )(b - a) > 0,  (4.1.9)

                      47
48                  CHAPTER 4. TOPOLOGY OF THE REAL LINE

so a < x. Hence x  (a, b).
    Now suppose x  (a, b). Then

    x= b-x a+ x-a b= b-x a+ 1- b-x b                                 (4.1.10)

and                                                                  Q.E.D.
                                          0 < b - x < 1.

4.2 Open sets

Definition 4.2.1. We say a set U  R is open if for every x  U there exists
  > 0 such that

                    (x - , x + )  U.                                 (4.2.1)

Proposition 4.2.1. Every open interval I is an open set.

Proof. Suppose I = (a, b), where a < b are extended real numbers. Given
x  I, let be the smaller of x - a and b - x. Suppose y  (x - , x + ). If
b = +, then b > y; otherwise, we have

    b - y > b - (x + ) = (b - x) -  (b - x) - (b - x) = 0,           (4.2.2)

so b > y. If a = -, then a < y; otherwise,

    y - a > (x - ) - a = (x - a) -  (x - a) - (x - a) = 0,           (4.2.3)

so a < y. Thus y  I and I is an open set.                            Q.E.D.

    Note that R is an open set (it is, in fact, the open interval (-, +)), as
is  (it satisfies the definition trivially).

Proposition 4.2.2. Suppose A is a set and, for each   A, U is an open set.
Then

                                    U                                (4.2.4)

                                 A

is an open set.

Proof. Let x  A U. Then x  U for some   A. Since U is open,
there exists an > 0 such that (x - , x + )  U. Thus

                    (x - , x + )  U  U.                              (4.2.5)

                                                             A

Hence A U is open.                                                   Q.E.D.
4.3. CLOSED SETS                                     49

Proposition 4.2.3. Suppose U1, U2, . . . , Un is a finite collection of open sets.

Then

                                                                       n

                                          Ui         (4.2.6)

                                     i=1

is open.

Proof. Let x  i=1 n Ui. Then x  Ui for every i = 1, 2, . . . , n. For each i,
choose i > 0 such that (x- i, x+ i)  Ui. Let be the smallest of 1, 2, . . . , n.

Then > 0 and

                  (x - , x + )  (x - i, x + i)  Ui   (4.2.7)

for every i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Thus

                                                 n   (4.2.8)

                  (x - , x + )  Ui.

                                                i=1

Hence i=1 n Ui is an open set.                       Q.E.D.

    Along with the facts that R and  are both open sets, the last two proposi-
tions show that the collection of open subsets of R form a topology.

Definition 4.2.2. Let A  R. We say x  A is an interior point of A if there
exists an > 0 such that (x - , x + )  A. We call the set of all interior points

of A the interior of A, denoted A.

Exercise 4.2.1. Show that if A  R, then A is open.

Exercise 4.2.2. Show that A is open if and only if A = A.

Exercise 4.2.3. Let U  R be a nonempty open set. Show that sup U / U
and inf U / U .

4.3 Closed sets

Definition 4.3.1. We call a point x  R a limit point of a set A  R if for
every > 0 there exists a  A, a = x, such that a  (x - , x + ).

Definition 4.3.2. Suppose A  R. We call a point a  A an isolated point of
A if there exists an > 0 such that

                  A  (a - , a + ) = {a}.             (4.3.1)
50              CHAPTER 4. TOPOLOGY OF THE REAL LINE

Exercise 4.3.1. Identify the limit points and isolated points of the following
sets:

a. [-1, 1],

b. (-1, 1),

c. 1 : n  Z+ ,
        n

d. Z,
e. Q.
Exercise 4.3.2. Suppose x is a limit point of the set A. Show that for every

  > 0, the set (x - , x + )  A is infinite.

    We let A denote the set of limit points of a set A.

Definition 4.3.3. Given a set A  R, we call the set A = A  A the closure
of A.

Definition 4.3.4. We call a set C  R closed if C = C.
Proposition 4.3.1. If A  R, then A is closed.

Proof. Suppose x is a limit point of A. We will show that x is a limit point of
A, and hence x  A. Now for any > 0, there exists a  A, a = x, such that

                a  x - 2,x + 2 .                        (4.3.2)

If a  A, let b = a. If a / A, then a is a limit point of A, so there exists b  A,
b = a and b = x, such that

                b  a - 2,a + 2 .                         (4.3.3)

In either case                                           (4.3.4)
                                                        Q.E.D.
                |x - b|  |x - a| + |a - b| < 2 + 2 = .

Hence x  A , and so A is closed.

Proposition 4.3.2. A set C  R is closed if and only if for every convergent
sequence {ak}kK with ak  C for all k  K,

                                  lim ak  C.            (4.3.5)

                                  k
4.3. CLOSED SETS                                                                                                      51

Proof. Suppose C is closed and {ak}kK is a convergent sequence with ak  C

for all k  K. Let x = lim ak. If x = ak for some integer k, then x  C.

                                               k

Otherwise, for every > 0, there exists an integer N such that |aN - x| < .

Hence aN = x and

                            aN  (x - , x + ).                                                                         (4.3.6)

Thus x is a limit point of C, and so x  C since C is closed.

    Now suppose that for every convergent sequence {ak}kK with ak  C for
all k  K, lim ak  C. Let x be a limit point of C. For k = 1, 2, 3, . . ., choose

                    k

ak  C such that ak  x - 1k , x + 1k . Then clearly

                            x = lim ak,                                                                               (4.3.7)

                                    k

so x  C. Thus C is closed.                                                                                        Q.E.D.

Exercise 4.3.3. Show that every closed interval I is a closed set.

Proposition 4.3.3. Suppose A is a set and, for each   A, C is a closed set.
Then

                                          C                                                                           (4.3.8)

                                     A

is a closed set.

Proof. Suppose x is a limit point of A C. Then for any > 0, there exists

y  A C such that y = x and y  (x - , x + ). But then for any   A,

y  C, so x is a limit point of C. Since C is closed, it follows that x  C

for every   A. Thus x  A C and A C is closed.                                                                     Q.E.D.

Then n

                                     i=1

is closed.

Proof. Suppose {ak}kK is a convergent sequence with ak  i=1 n Ci for every

k  K. Let L = lim ak. Since K is an infinite set, there must exist an integer
                  k
m and a subsequence {anj } j=1 such that anj  Cm for j = 1, 2, . . .. Since every
                                                        
subsequence of {ak}kK     converges  to  L,  {a  nj  }  j=1                                   must  converge  to  L.  Since

Cm is closed,

                                                                                           n

                          L = lim anj  Cm  Ci.                                                                    (4.3.10)

Thus i=1 n Ci is closed.                                                                                          Q.E.D.
52             CHAPTER 4. TOPOLOGY OF THE REAL LINE

    Note that both R and  satisfy the definition of a closed set.

Proposition 4.3.5. A set C  R is closed if and only if R \ C is open.

Proof. Assume C is closed and let U = R \ C. If C = R, then U = , which is
open; if C = , then U = R, which is open. So we may assume both C and U
are nonempty. Let x  U . Then x is not a limit point of C, so there exists an

> 0 such that

               (x - , x + )  C = .                                 (4.3.11)

Thus

               (x - , x + )  U,                                    (4.3.12)

so U is open.

    Now suppose U = R \ C is open. If U = R, then C = , which is closed;
if U = , then C = R, which is closed. So we may assume both U and C are
nonempty. Let x be a limit point of C. Then, for every > 0,

               (x - , x + )  C = .                                 (4.3.13)

Hence there does not exist > 0 such that

Thus x / U , so x  C and C is closed.                              Q.E.D.

Definition 4.4.1. Suppose T  R. If A is a set, U is an open set for every
  A, and

                  T  U,                                                       (4.4.1)

                  A

then we call {U :   A} an open cover of T .

Example 4.4.1. For n = 3, 4, 5, . . ., let

      Un = 1 , n - 1 .
                nn

Then {Un : n = 3, 4, 5, . . .} is an open cover of the open interval (0, 1).

Definition 4.4.2. Suppose {U :   A} is an open cover of T  R. If B  A
and

                  T  U,                                                       (4.4.2)

                  B

then we call {U :   B} a subcover of {U :   A}. If B is finite, we call
{U :   B} a finite subcover of {U :   A}.

Exercise 4.4.1. Show that the open cover of (0, 1) given in the previous ex-
ample does not have a finite subcover.

Definition 4.4.3. We say a set K  R is compact if every open cover of K has
a finite subcover.

Example 4.4.2. As a consequence of the previous exercise, the open interval
(0, 1) is not compact.

Exercise 4.4.2. Show that every finite subset of R is compact.
Exercise 4.4.3. Suppose n  Z+ and K1, K2, . . . , Kn are compact sets. Show
that i=1 n Ki is compact.

Proposition 4.4.1. If I is a closed, bounded interval, then I is compact.

Proof. Let a  b be finite real numbers and I = [a, b]. Suppose {U :   A}

is an open cover of I. Let O be the set of sets {U :   B} with the properties

that B is a finite subset of A and a  B U. Let

Clearly, a  T so T = . Let s = sup T . Suppose s < b. Since {U :   A} is

an open cover of I, there exists an   A for which s  U. Hence there exists

an > 0 such that

                             (s - , s + )  U.                                         (4.4.4)

Moreover, there exists a {U :   B}  O for which

                             [a, s - 2 ]  U.                                          (4.4.5)

contradicting the definition of s. Hence we must have s = b. Now choose U
such that b  U. Then, for some > 0,

                             (b - , b + )  U.                                         (4.4.8)

Proposition 4.4.2. If K is a closed, bounded subset of R, then K is compact.

Proof. Since K is bounded, there exist finite real numbers a and b such that
K  [a, b]. Let {U :   A} be an open cover of K. Let V = R \ K. Then

                             {U :   A}  {V }                                          (4.4.11)

is an open cover of [a, b]. Since [a, b] is compact, there exists a finite subcover
of this cover. This subcover is either of the form {U :   B} or {U :  
B}  {V } for some B  A. In the former case, we have

                             K  [a, b]  U;                                            (4.4.12)

                                                     B

in the latter case, we have

                                    K  [a, b] \ V  U.                                 (4.4.13)
                                                                                      Q.E.D.
                                                                                   B

In either case, we have found a finite subcover of {U :   A}.

Then        

                Un = (-, x)  (x, +)  K.                                           (4.4.15)

However, for any N  Z+, there exists a  K with

           a  x- 1 ,x+ 1 ,
                                                                 N  N

and hence

           a / Un =

                  n=1

Thus the open cover {Un : n  Z+} does not have a finite subcover, contradicting

the assumption that K is compact.                                                 Q.E.D.

Exercise 4.4.5. Suppose that for each  in some set A, K is compact. Show
that A K is compact.

Proposition 4.4.4. If K  R is compact, then K is bounded.
Proof. Suppose K is not bounded. For n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., let Un = (-n, n). Then

                                                                                  (4.4.18)

But, for any integer N , there exists a  K such that |a| > N , from which it

follows that

                       n=1

Thus the open cover {Un : n  Z+} does not have a finite subcover, contradicting

    Taken together, the previous three propositions yield the following funda-
mental result:

Theorem 4.4.5 (Heine-Borel Theorem). A set K  R is compact if and only
if K is closed and bounded.

Proposition 4.4.6. If K  R is compact and {xn}nI is a sequence with
xn  K for every n  I, then {xn}nI has a convergent subsequence {xnk } k=1

with

                                   lim xnk  K.                   (4.4.20)

                                   k

Proof. Since K is bounded, {xn}nI has a convergent subsequence {xnk } k=1.

Since K is closed, we must have lim xnk  K.                      Q.E.D.

                                                              k

Proposition 4.4.7. Suppose K  R is such that whenever {xn}nI is a se-
quence with xn  K for every n  I, then {xn}nI has a subsequence {xnk } k=1
with lim xnk  K. Then K is compact.

         k

Proof. Suppose K is unbounded. Then we may construct a sequence {xn} n=1
such that xn  K and |xn| > n for n = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Hence the only possi-

ble subsequential limits of {xn} n=1 would be - and +, contradicting our

assumptions. Thus K must be bounded.

Now suppose {xn}nI is a convergent sequence with xn  K for all n  I. If

L = lim xn, then L is the only subsequential limit of {xn}nI . Hence, by the

        n

assumptions of the proposition, L  K. Hence K is closed.

Since K is both closed and bounded, it is compact.               Q.E.D.

Exercise 4.4.6. Show that a set K  R is compact if and only if every infinite
subset of K has a limit point in K.

Exercise 4.4.7. Show that if K is compact, then sup K  K and inf K  K.

Theorem 4.4.8. Given a set K  R, the following are equivalent:
1. Every open cover of K has a finite subcover.
2. Every sequence in K has a subsequential limit in K.
3. Every infinite subset of K has a limit point in K.

    It should be clear that if lim f (x) = L and S+(D, a) = , then f (a+) = L.

Proposition 5.1.1. Suppose D  R, f : D  R, and a is a limit point of D.
If f (a-) = f (a+) = L, then lim f (x) = L.

                                                      xa

Proof. Suppose {xn} n=m  S(D, a). Let

                          J - = {n : n  Z, xn < a}            (5.1.15)

and

                          J+ = {n : n  Z, xn > a}.            (5.1.16)

Suppose J- is empty or finite and let k = m - 1 if J- =  and, otherwise, let
k be the largest integer in J -. Then {xn} n=k+1  S+(D, a), and so

                                    lim f (xn) = f (a+) = L.  (5.1.17)

                                                   n

A similar argument shows that if J+ is empty or finite, then

                           lim f (xn) = f (a-) = L.           (5.1.18)

                          n

    If neither J - nor J + is finite or empty, then {xn}nJ- and {xn}nJ+ are sub-
sequences of {xn} n=m with {xn}nJ-  S-(D, a) and {xn}nJ+  S+(D, a).

Hence, given any > 0, we may find integers N and M such that

                          |f (xn) - L| <                      (5.1.19)

J-  J+ = {j : j  Z+, j  m}, it follows that

let  > 0 be such that |f (x) - L| < whenever x = a and x  (a - , a + )  D.

5.1.3 Examples

Example 5.1.5. Define f : R  R by

                                            1, if x is rational,
                                f (x) =

                                            0, if x is irrational.

Let a  R. Since every open interval contains both rational and irrational
numbers, for any  > 0 and any choice of L  R, there will exist x  (a-, a+),
x = a, such that

                                          |f (x) - L|  1 .
                                                           2

Hence lim f (x) does not exist for any real number a.

            xa

Example 5.1.6. Define f : R  R by

                                            x, if x is rational,
                                f (x) =

                                            0, if x is irrational.

Then lim f (x) = 0 since, given > 0, |f (x)| < provided |x| < .

             f (x) = q        if x is irrational,

                      0,

where p and q are taken to be relatively prime integers with q > 0, and we take
q = 1 when x = 0. Show that, for any real number a, lim f (x) = 0.

Next define s : R  R by s(x) = (x - x ), where x denotes the largest
integer less than or equal to x (that is, x is the floor of x). The function s is

an example of a sawtooth function. See the graphs of  and s in Figure 5.1.1.
Note that for any n  Z,

                                   s([n, n + 1]) = [-1, 1].

Now let D = R \ {0} and define  : D  R by

                                   (x) = s         1      .

                         1 , 1 = s([n, n + 1]) = [-1, 1].
                               n+1 n

Hence for any > 0, ((0, )) = [-1, 1], and so lim (x) does not exist.

                                                                                                   x0+

5.2 Monotonic functions

Definition 5.2.1. Suppose D  R, f : D  R, and (a, b)  D. We say
f is increasing on (a, b) if f (x) < f (y) whenever a < x < y < b; we say f

is decreasing on (a, b) if f (x) > f (y) whenever a < x < y < b; we say f is
nondecreasing on (a, b) if f (x)  f (y) whenever a < x < y < b; and we say f is
nonincreasing on (a, b) if f (x)  f (y) whenever a < x < y < b. We will say f is
monotonic on (a, b) if f is either nondecreasing or nonincreasing on (a, b) and

we will say f is strictly monotonic on (a, b) if f is either increasing or decreasing

on (a, b).

Proposition 5.2.1. If f is monotonic on (a, b), then f (c+) and f (c-) exist for
every c  (a, b).

Proof. Suppose f is nondecreasing on (a, b). Let c  (a, b) and let

                    = sup{f (x) : a < x < c}.                        (5.2.1)
68                CHAPTER 5. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY

Note that   f (c) < +. Given any > 0, there must exist  > 0 such that

                   - < f (c - )  .                                                         (5.2.2)

Since f is nondecreasing, it follows that

                  |f (x) - | <                                                             (5.2.3)

whenever x  (c - , c). Thus f (c-) = . A similar argument shows that

f (c+) =  where

                   = inf{f (x) : c < x < b}.                                               (5.2.4)

    If f is nonincreasing, similar arguments yield

                  f (c-) = inf{f (x) : a < x < c}                                          (5.2.5)

and

                  f (c+) = sup{f (x) : c < x < b}.                                         (5.2.6)

                                                                                           Q.E.D.

Proposition 5.2.2. If f is nondecreasing on (a, b) and a < x < y < b, then

                  f (x+)  f (y-).                                                          (5.2.7)

Proof. By the previous proposition,

                  f (x+) = inf{f (t) : x < t < b}                                          (5.2.8)

and                                                                                        (5.2.9)
                               f (y-) = sup{f (t) : a < t < y}.

Since f is nondecreasing,

                  inf{f (t) : x < t < b} = inf{f (t) : x < t < y}                          (5.2.10)

and               sup{f (t) : a < t < y} = sup{f (t) : x < t < y}.                         (5.2.11)
Thus

     f (x+) = inf{f (t) : x < t < y}  sup{f (t) : x < t < y} = f (y-). (5.2.12)

                                                                                           Q.E.D.

Similarly, we say that that f diverges to - as x approaches a, denoted

5.4 Continuous Functions

5.4.1 Continuity at a point

Definition 5.4.1. Suppose D  R, f : D  R, and a  D. We say f is
continuous at a if either a is an isolated point of D or lim f (x) = f (a). If f is

                                                                                                        xa

not continuous at a, we say f is discontinuous at a, or that f has a discontinuity
at a.
Example 5.4.1. Define f : R  R by

                                            1, if x is rational,
                                f (x) =

                                            0, if x is irrational.

Then, by Example 5.1.5, f is discontinuous at every x  R.
Example 5.4.2. Define f : R  R by

                                            x, if x is rational,
                                f (x) =

                                            0, if x is irrational.

Then, by Example 5.1.6 and Exercise 5.1.10, f is continuous at 0, but discon-
tinuous at every x = 0.

If D  R,   R, f : D  R, and g : D  R, then we define f : D  R by

                                        (f )(x) = f (x),                         (5.4.1)

f + g : D  R by

                                (f + g)(x) = f (x) + g(x),                       (5.4.2)
                                                                                 (5.4.3)
and f g : D  R by

                                     (f g)(x) = f (x)g(x).

Moreover,  if  g(x)  =  0  for  all  x    D,  we  define   f  :  D    R  by
                                                           g

                                          f            f (x)
                                              (x) = .                            (5.4.4)
                                          g            g(x)

Proposition 5.4.1. Suppose D  R,   R, f : D  R, and g : D  R. If

f and g are continuous at a, then f , f + g, and f g are all continuous at a.

Moreover,  if  g(x) = 0    for  all  x  D,    then  f  is  continuous    at  a.
                                                    g

Exercise 5.4.1. Prove the previous proposition.

Proposition 5.4.2. Suppose D  R, f : D  R, f (x)  0 for all x  D, and
f is continuous at a  D. If g : D  R is defined by g(x) = f (x), then g is

continuous at a.

Exercise 5.4.2. Prove the previous proposition.

Proposition 5.4.3. Suppose D  R, f : D  R, and a  D. Then f is
continuous at a if and only if for every > 0 there exists  > 0 such that

               |f (x) - f (a)| < whenever x  (a - , a + )  D.                    (5.4.5)

Proof. Suppose f is continuous at a. If a is an isolated point of D, then there
exists a  > 0 such that

                                (a - , a + )  D = {a}.                           (5.4.6)

Then for any > 0, if x  (a - , a + )  D, then x = a, and so

                        |f (x) - f (a)| = |f (a) - f (a)| = 0 < .                (5.4.7)

If a is a limit point of D, then lim f (x) = f (a) implies that for any > 0 there

                                                          xa

exists  > 0 such that

               |f (x) - f (a)| < whenever x  (a - , a + )  D.                    (5.4.8)
72                              CHAPTER 5. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY

    Now suppose that for every > 0 there exists  > 0 such that

    |f (x) - f (a)| < whenever x  (a - , a + )  D.              (5.4.9)

If a is an isolated point, then f is continuous at a. If a is a limit point, then
this condition implies lim f (x) = f (a), and so f is continuous at a. Q.E.D.

                                          xa

    From the preceding, it should be clear that a function f : D  R is contin-

uous at a point a of D if and only if for every sequence {xn}nI with xn  D

for every n  I and lim xn = a, lim f (xn) = f (a).
                  n             n

Exercise 5.4.3. Show that if f : D  R is continuous at a  D and f (a) > 0,
then there exists an open interval I such that a  I and f (x) > 0 for every

x  I  D.

Proposition 5.4.4. Suppose D  R, E  R, g : D  R, f : E  R, g(D)  E,
and a  D. If g is continuous at a and f is continuous at g(a), then f  g is

continuous at a.

Proof. Let {xn}nI be a sequence with xn  D for every n  I and lim xn = a.

                                                                                                                             n

Then, since g is continuous at a, {g(xn)}nI is a sequence with g(xn)  E

for every n  I and lim g(xn) = g(a). Hence, since f is continuous at g(a),

                                        n

 lim f (g(xn)) = f (g(a)). That is,

n

                      lim (f  g)(xn) = (f  g)(a).               (5.4.10)

                     n

Hence f  g is continuous at a.                                  Q.E.D.

Definition 5.4.2. Let D  R, f : D  R, and a  D. If f is not continuous
at a but both f (a-) and f (a+) exist, then we say f has a simple discontinuity

at a.

Proposition 5.4.5. Suppose f is monotonic on the interval (a, b). Then every
discontinuity of f in (a, b) is a simple discontinuity. Moreover, if E is the set of
points in (a, b) at which f is discontinuous, then either E = , E is finite, or E
is countable.

Proof. The first statement follows immediately from Proposition 5.2.1. For

the second statement, suppose f is nondecreasing and suppose E is nonempty.

From Exercise 2.1.26 and the the proof of Proposition 5.2.1, it follows that for

every x  (a, b),

                     f (x-)  f (x)  f (x+).                     (5.4.11)

Hence x  E if and only if f (x-) < f (x+). Hence for every x  E, we may
choose a rational number rx such that f (x-) < rx < f (x+). Now if x, y  E
with x < y, then, by Proposition 5.2.2,

                     rx < f (x+)  f (y-) < ry,                  (5.4.12)
5.4. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS                                   73

so rx = ry. Thus we have a one-to-one correspondence between E and a subset

of Q, and so E is either finite or countable. A similar argument holds if f is

nonincreasing.                                              Q.E.D.

Exercise 5.4.4. Define f : R  R by
                
                1                                        p
                           , if x is rational and x = ,
                f (x) = q                                q
                0, if x is irrational,

where p and q are taken to be relatively prime integers with q > 0, and we take
q = 1 when x = 0. Show that f is continuous at every irrational number and
has a simple discontinuity at every rational number.

5.4.2 Continuity on a set

Definition 5.4.3. Suppose D  R and f : D  R. We say f is continuous on
D if f is continuous at every point a  D.

Proposition 5.4.6. If f is a polynomial, then f is continuous on R.

Proposition 5.4.7. If D  R and f : D  R is a rational function, then f is
continuous on D.

                                                                      
Exercise 5.4.5. Explain why the function f (x) = 1 - x2 is continuous on
[-1, 1].

Exercise 5.4.6. Discuss the continuity of the function

                           
                           x + 1, if x < 0,

                f (x) =  2 4,       if x = 0,
                            x,      if x > 0.

If D  R, f : D  R, and E  R, we let                         (5.4.13)
                              f -1(E) = {x : f (x)  E}.

Proposition 5.4.8. Suppose D  R and f : D  R. Then f is continuous on
D if and only if for every open set V  R, f -1(V ) = U  D for some open set
U  R.

Proof. Suppose f is continuous on D and V  R is an open set. If V f (D) = ,
then f -1(V ) = , which is open. So suppose V  f (D) =  and let a  f -1(V ).
Since V is open and f (a)  V , there exists a > 0 such that

                (f (a) - a, f (a) + a)  V.                  (5.4.14)
74         CHAPTER 5. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY

Since f is continuous, there exists a > 0 such that            (5.4.15)
            f ((a - a, a + a)  D)  (f (a) - a, f (a) + a)  V.

That is, (a - a, a + a)  D  f -1(V ). Let

       U=  (a - a, a + a).                                     (5.4.16)

           af -1(V )

Then U is open and f -1(V ) = U  D.

    Now suppose that for every open set V  R, f -1(V ) = U  D for some open
set U  R. Let a  D and let > 0 be given. Since (f (a) - , f (a) + ) is open,
there exists an open set U such that

       U  D = f -1((f (a) - , f (a) + )).                      (5.4.17)

Since U is open and a  U , there exists  > 0 such that (a - , a + )  U . But

then

       f ((a - , a + )  D)  (f (a) - , f (a) + ).              (5.4.18)

That is, if x  (a - , a + )  D, then |f (x) - f (a)| < . Hence f is continuous

at a.                                                          Q.E.D.

Exercise 5.4.7. Let D  R and f : D  R. For any E  R, show that
f -1(R \ E) = (R \ f -1(E))  D.

Exercise 5.4.8. Let A be a set and, for each   A, let U  R. Given D  R
and a function f : D  R, show that

            f -1(U) = f -1       U

       A                    A

and

          f -1(U) = f -1       U .

Exercise 5.4.9. Suppose D  R and f : D  R. Show that f is continuous
on D if and only if for every closed set C  R, f -1(C) = F  D for some closed
set F  R.

Exercise 5.4.10. Let D  R. We say a function f : D  R is Lipschitz if
there exists   R,  > 0, such that |f (x) - f (y)|  |x - y| for all x, y  D.

Show that if f is Lipschitz, then f is continuous.

5.4.3 Intermediate Value Theorem

Theorem 5.4.9 (Intermediate Value Theorem). Suppose a, b  R, a < b, and
f : [a, b]  R. If f is continuous and s  R is such that either f (a)  s  f (b)
or f (b)  s  f (a), then there exists c  [a, b] such that f (c) = s.

Proof. Suppose f (a) < f (b) and f (a) < s < f (b). Let

                        c = sup{x : x  [a, b], f (x)  s}.                        (5.4.19)

Suppose f (c) < s. Then c < b and, since f is continuous at c, there exists

a  > 0 such that f (x) < s for all x  (c, c + ). But then f c + 2 < s,
contradicting the definition of c. Similarly, if f (c) > s, then c > a and there

exists  > 0 such that f (x) > s for all x  (c - , c), again contradicting the

definition of c. Hence we must have f (c) = s.                                   Q.E.D.

Example 5.4.3. Suppose a  R, a > 0, and consider f (x) = xn - a where
n  Z, n > 1. Then f (0) = -a < 0 and

                    f (1 + a) = (1 + a)n - a

                                                       n  n ai - a
                                                          i
                               = 1 + na +

                                                     i=2

                                                                  n  n ai > 0,
                                                                     i
                               = 1 + (n - 1)a +

                                                                i=2

where  n  is the binomial coefficient
       i

                               n           n!                                    (5.4.20)
                                  i = i!(n - i)! .

Hence, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a real number  > 0

such that n = a. Moreover, there is only one such  since f is increasing on

(0, +).

    We call  the nth root of a, and write

                                   = n a                                         (5.4.21)

or                                         1

                                   = an.                                         (5.4.22)

Moreover, if a  R, a < 0, n  Z+ is odd, and  is the nth root of -a, then

                    (-)n = (-1)n()n = (-1)(-a) = a.                              (5.4.23)

That is, - is the nth root of a.

Definition  5.4.4.  If  n=  p  Q  with  q   Z+,           then       we  define
                            q

on (0, +).

Intermediate Value Theorem.

5.4.4 Extreme Value Theorem

Theorem 5.4.10. Suppose D  R is compact and f : D  R is continuous.
Then f (D) is compact.

Proof. Given a sequence {yn}nI in f (D), choose a sequence {xn}nI such

that f (xn) = yn. Since D is compact, {xn}nI has a convergent subsequence

{xnk } k=1 with

                         lim xnk = x  D.                  (5.4.25)

                         k

Let y = f (x). Then y  f (D) and, since f is continuous,

                         y = lim f (xnk ) = lim ynk .     (5.4.26)
                         k  k

Hence f (D) is compact.                                   Q.E.D.

Exercise 5.4.17. Prove the previous theorem using the open cover definition
of a compact set.

Theorem 5.4.11 (Extreme Value Theorem). Suppose D  R is compact and
f : D  R is continuous. Then there exists a  D such that f (a)  f (x) for all
x  D and there exists b  D such that f (b)  f (x) for all x  D.
5.4. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS                               77

Proof. Let s = sup f (D) and t = inf f (D). Then s  f (D), so there exists

a  D such that f (a) = s, and t  f (D), so there exists b  D such that

f (b) = t.                                              Q.E.D.

    As a consequence of the Extreme Value Theorem, a continuous function on
a closed bounded interval attains both a maximum and a minimum value.

Exercise 5.4.18. Find an example of a closed bounded interval [a, b] and a
function f : [a, b]  R such that f attains neither a maximum nor a minimum
value on [a, b].

Exercise 5.4.19. Find an example of a bounded interval I and a function
f : I  R which is continuous on I such that f attains neither a maximum nor
a minimum value on I.

Exercise 5.4.20. Suppose K  R is compact and a / K. Show that there
exists b  K such that |b - a|  |x - a| for all x  K.

Proposition 5.4.12. Suppose D  R is compact, f : D  R is continuous and
one-to-one, and E = f (D). Then f -1 : E  D is continuous.

Proof. Let V  R be an open set. We need to show that f (V  D) = U  E
for some open set U  R. Let C = D  (R \ V ). Then C is a closed subset of D,
and so is compact. Hence f (C) is a compact subset of E. Thus f (C) is closed,
and so U = R \ f (C) is open. Moreover, U  E = E \ f (C) = f (V  D). Thus
f -1 is continuous.

Exercise 5.4.21. Suppose f : [0, 1]  (2, 3]  [0, 2] by

                        x,  if 0  x  1,
            f (x) =
            x - 1, if 2 < x  3.

Show that f is continuous, one-to-one, and onto, but that f -1 is not continuous.

5.4.5 Uniform continuity

Definition 5.4.5. Suppose D  R and f : D  R. We say f is uniformly
continuous on D if for every > 0 there exists  > 0 such that for any x, y  D,

            |f (x) - f (y)| < whenever |x - y| < .      (5.4.27)

    Clearly, if f is uniformly continuous on D then f is continuous on D. How-
ever, a continuous function need not be uniformly continuous.

Example 5.4.4. Define f : (0, +) by f (x) = 1x . Given any  > 0, choose
     Z+                  1                    1              n+1 1 .
n        such  that  n(n+1)  <  .  Let  x  =  n  and  y  =            Then

                     |x - y| = 1 - 1 = 1 < .
                                  n n + 1 n(n + 1)

However,

                     |f (x) - f (y)| = |n - (n + 1)| = 1.

Hence, for example, there does not exist a  > 0 such that

                                        |f (x) - f (y)| < 1
                                                              2

whenever |x - y| < . Thus f is not uniformly continuous on (0, +), although
f is continuous on (0, +).

Example 5.4.5. Define f : R  R by f (x) = 2x. Let                     > 0 be given. If  = 2 ,
then

                                 |f (x) - f (y)| = 2|x - y| <

whenever |x - y| < . Hence f is uniformly continuous on R.

Exercise 5.4.23. Let f (x) = x2. Show that f is not uniformly continuous on
(-, +).

Proposition 5.4.13. Suppose D  R is compact and f : D  R is continuous.
Then f is uniformly continuous on D.

Proof. Let > 0 be given. For every x  D, choose x such that

                                        |f (x) - f (y)| < 2                 (5.4.28)
whenever y  D and |x - y| < x. Let                                          (5.4.29)

                                Jx = x - x , x + x .
                                              2          2

Then {Jx : x  D} is an open cover of D. Since D is compact, there must exist

x1, x2, . . . , xn, n  Z+, such that Jx1 , Jx2 , . . . , Jxn is an open cover of D. Let 

be the smallest of

                                   x1 , x2 , . . . , xn .                   (5.4.30)

5.4. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS                                         79

Now let x, y  D with |x - y| < . Then for some integer k, 1  k  n, x  Jxk ,

that is,

           |x - xk| < xk .                                        (5.4.31)
                           2

Moreover,

           |y - xk|  |y - x| + |x - xk| <  + xk  xk .             (5.4.32)
                                                          2

Hence

|f (x) - f (y)|  |f (x) - f (xk)| + |f (xk) - f (y)| < 2 + 2 = .  (5.4.33)
                                                                  Q.E.D.

Exercise 5.4.24. Suppose D  R and f : D  R is uniformly continuous.
Show that if {xn}nI is a Cauchy sequence in D, then {f (xn)}nI is a Cauchy
sequence in f (D).

Exercise 5.4.25. Suppose f : (0, 1)  R is uniformly continuous. Show that
f (0+) exists.

6.1 Best linear approximations

Definition 6.1.1. We say a function f : R  R is linear if for every x, y  R,

          f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y)          (6.1.1)

and for every   R and x  R,

                             f (x) = f (x).  (6.1.2)

Exercise 6.1.1. Show that if f : R  R is linear, then there exists m  R such
that f (x) = mx for all x  R.

Definition 6.1.2. Suppose D  R, f : D  R, and a is an interior point of D.

We say f is differentiable at a if there exists a linear function dfa : R  R such

that  lim f (x) - f (a) - dfa(x - a) = 0.

      xa                     x-a             (6.1.3)

We call the function dfa the best linear approximation to f at a, or the differ-
ential of f at a.

Proposition 6.1.1. Suppose D  R, f : D  R, and a is an interior point of
D. Then f is differentiable at a if and only if

             lim f (x) - f (a)               (6.1.4)
             xa x - a

exists, in which case dfa(x) = mx where

          m = lim f (x) - f (a) .            (6.1.5)

Proof. Let m  R and let L : R  R be the linear function L(x) = mx. Then

                f (x) - f (a) - L(x - a) = f (x) - f (a) - m(x - a)
                       x-a                                  x-a

6.2 Derivatives

Definition 6.2.1. Suppose D  R, f : D  R, a is an interior point of D, and
f is differentiable at a. We call

                                 lim f (x) - f (a)                     (6.2.1)
                                 xa x - a

the derivative of f at a, which we denote f (a).

    Note that if f is differentiable at a, then

                       lim f (x) - f (a) = lim f (a + h) - f (a) .     (6.2.2)
                       xa x - a      h0                     h

Definition 6.2.2. Suppose D  R, f : D  R, and E is the set of interior

points of D at which f is differentiable. We call the function f : E  R defined

by

                       f (x) = lim f (x + h) - f (x)                   (6.2.3)
                                 h0                  h

the derivative of f .

Example 6.2.1. Let n  Z+ and define f : R  R by f (x) = xn. Then

                f (x) = lim    (x + h)n - xn

                                                k=2

                       = nxn-1.

Example 6.2.2. Define f : R  R by f (x) = |x|. Then

         f (0 + h) - f (0) = |h| = 1, if h > 0,
                  h                       h  -1, if h < 0.

Hence             lim f (0 + h) - f (0) = -1

                  h0-                     h

and               lim f (0 + h) - f (0) = 1.

                  h0+                     h

Thus f is not differentiable at 0.

                                    f (x) = x2, if x  0.

Is f differentiable at 0?
Exercise 6.2.4. Define f : R  R by

                                                 x2, if x < 0,
                                    f (x) = x3, if x  0.

Is f differentiable at 0?

Proposition 6.2.1. If f is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a.

Proof. If f is differentiable at a, then

     lim (f (x) - f (a)) = lim f (x) - f (a) (x - a) = f (a)(0) = 0.  (6.2.4)
     xa           xa                x-a

Hence lim f (x) = f (a), and so f is continuous at a.                 Q.E.D.

where we know lim g(a + h) = g(a) by the continuity of g at a, which in turn

where we know lim g(a + h) = g(a) by the continuity of g at a, which in turn

Exercise 6.2.8. Show that for any integer n = 0, if f (x) = xn, then f (x) =

Proposition 6.2.6 (Chain rule). Suppose D  R, E  R, g : D  R, f : E 
R, g(D)  E, g is differentiable at a, and f is differentiable at g(a). Then f  g

is differentiable at a and

                  (f  g) (a) = f (g(a))g (a).                           (6.2.9)

Proof. Since a is an interior point of D and g(a) is an interior point of E, we may

choose  > 0 so that (a - , a + )  D and > 0 so that (g(a) - , g(a) + )  E.

Define  : (-, )  R by                                        if h = 0,  (6.2.10)

and  : (- , )  R by                                          if h = 0,  (6.2.11)

          (h) = 0, h

The assumption that g is differentiable at a implies that  is continuous at 0
and the assumption that f is differentiable at g(a) implies that  is continuous
at 0. Moreover, note that

           f (g(a + h)) = (h(h) + g (a)h)(h(h) + g (a)h)                    (6.2.17)
                                 + f (g(a))(h(h) + g (a)h) + f (g(a)),      (6.2.18)

so

       f (g(a + h)) - f (g(a)) = (h(h) + g (a)h)(h(h) + g (a)h)
                                          + f (g(a))(h(h) + g (a)h)

                                    = h(h)(h(h) + g (a)h)
                                          + hg (a)(h(h) + g (a)h)
                                          + f (g(a))(h)h + f (g(a))g (a)h.

Hence

  f (g(a + h)) - f (g(a)) = f (g(a))g (a) + (h)(h(h) + g (a)h)
               h
                                     + g (a)(h(h) + g (a)h) + f (g(a))(h). (6.2.19)

Now

                   lim (h) = 0,                                             (6.2.20)
                                                                            (6.2.21)

                   lim (h(h) + g (a)h) = 0,

                   h0

and, since  and  are continuous at 0,

                   lim (h(h) + g (a)h) = 0.                                 (6.2.22)

                   h0                                                       (6.2.23)

Thus  lim f (g(a + h)) - f (g(a)) = f (g(a))g (a).

Proposition 6.2.7. Suppose D  R, f : D  R is one-to-one, a is in the
interior of D, f (a) is in the interior of f (D), f -1 is continuous at f (a), and f
is differentiable at a with f (a) = 0. Then f -1 is differentiable at f (a) and

          (f -1) (f (a)) = 1 .                                            (6.2.24)
                              f (a)

Proof. Choose  > 0 so that (f (a) - , f (a) + )  f (D). For h  (-, ), let

          k = f -1(f (a) + h) - a.                                        (6.2.25)

Then

          f -1(f (a) + h) = a + k,                                        (6.2.26)
                                                                          (6.2.27)
so                                                                        (6.2.28)
                                       f (a) + h = f (a + k)
                                                                          (6.2.29)
and
                                      h = f (a + k) - f (a).

Hence

f -1(f (a) + h) - f -1(f (a))         a+k-a                      1
       h = f (a + k) - f (a) = f (a + k) - f (a) .

Now if h  0, then k  0 (since f -1 is continuous at f (a)), and so

lim    f -1(f (a) + h) - f -1(f (a))  = lim                   1  =  1  .  (6.2.30)

Example 6.2.3. For n  Z+, define f : [0, +)  R by f (x) = n x. Then f is

       f (x) = 1 g (f (x)) = n( n x)n-1 1 = 1n x n1 -1.

Exercise 6.2.9. Let n = 0 be a rational number and let f (x) = xn. Show that

6.3 Mean Value Theorem

6.3.1 Rolle's theorem

Definition 6.3.1. We say f is differentiable on an open interval I if f is dif-
ferentiable at every point a  I.
88                           CHAPTER 6. DERIVATIVES

Definition 6.3.2. Suppose D  R and f : D  R. We say f has a local
maximum at a point a  D if there exists  > 0 such that f (a)  f (x) for all

x  (a - , a + )  D. We say f has a local minimum at a point a  D if there

exists  > 0 such that f (a)  f (x) for all x  (a - , a + )  D.

Proposition 6.3.1. Suppose D  R, f : D  R, and a is an interior point of D
at which f has either a local maximum or a local minimum. If f is differentiable

at a, then f (a) = 0.

Proof. Suppose f has a local maximum at a (a similar argument works if f has
a local minimum at a). Choose  > 0 so that (a - , a + )  D and f (a)  f (x)
for all x  (a - , a + ). Then

                             f (x) - f (a)  0                (6.3.1)
                                 x-a

for all x  (a - , a) and     f (x) - f (a)  0                (6.3.2)
for all x  (a, a + ). Hence      x-a

                              lim f (x) - f (a)  0           (6.3.3)
                             xa- x - a

and                           lim f (x) - f (a)  0.          (6.3.4)
Hence                        xa+ x - a                       (6.3.5)

       0  lim f (x) - f (a) = f (a) = lim f (x) - f (a)  0,
               xa- x - a     xa+ x - a

so we must have f (a) = 0.                                   Q.E.D.

Theorem 6.3.2 (Rolle's Theorem). Let a, b  R and suppose f is continuous
on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b). If f (a) = f (b), then there exists a point

c  (a, b) at which f (c) = 0.

Proof. By the Extreme Value Theorem, we know f attains a maximum and a

minimum value on [a, b]. Let m be the minimum value and M the maximum

value of f on [a, b]. If m = M = f (a) = f (b), then f (x) = m for all x  [a, b],

and so f (x) = 0 for all x  (a, b). Otherwise, one of m or M occurs at a point

c in (a, b). Hence f has either a local maximum or a local minimum at c, and

so f (c) = 0.                                                Q.E.D.

Exercise 6.3.1. Suppose f is differentiable on (a, b) and f (x) = 0 for all
x  (a, b). Show that for any x, y  (a, b), f (x) = f (y).

tion.

Exercise 6.3.3. Let f (x) be a third degree polynomial. Show that the equation
f (x) = 0 as at least one, but no more than three, solutions.

6.3.2 Mean Value Theorem

Theorem 6.3.3 (Generalized Mean Value Theorem). Let a, b  R. If f and
g are continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), then there exists a point
c  (a, b) at which

                    (f (b) - f (a))g (c) = (g(b) - g(a))f (c).          (6.3.6)

Proof. Let

            h(t) = (f (b) - f (a))g(t) - (g(b) - g(a))f (t).            (6.3.7)

Then h is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b). Moreover,

            h(a) = f (b)g(a) - f (a)g(a) - f (a)g(b) + f (a)g(a)        (6.3.8)
                  = f (b)g(a) - f (a)g(b)

and

            h(b) = f (b)g(b) - f (a)g(b) - f (b)g(b) + f (b)g(a)        (6.3.9)
                  = f (b)g(a) - f (a)g(b).

Hence, by Rolle's theorem, there exists a point c  (a, b) at which h (c) = 0.
But then

     0 = h (c) = (f (b) - f (a))g (c) - (g(b) - g(a))f (c),             (6.3.10)

which implies that

                    (f (b) - f (a))g (c) = (g(b) - g(a))f (c).          (6.3.11)

                                                                        Q.E.D.

Theorem 6.3.4 (Mean Value Theorem). Let a, b  R. If f is continuous on
[a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), then there exists a point c  (a, b) at which

                    f (b) - f (a) = (b - a)f (c).                       (6.3.12)

Exercise 6.3.4. Prove the Mean Value Theorem using Rolle's theorem and the

function                         f (b) - f (a) (t - a) + f (a) .

Exercise 6.3.5. Let a, b  R. Suppose f is continuous on [a, b], differentiable
on (a, b), and |f (x)|  M for all x  (a, b). Show that

               |f (b) - f (a)|  M |b - a|.

Exercise 6.3.6. Show that for all x > 0,

Exercise 6.3.8. Suppose I is an open interval, f : I  R, g : I  R, and
f (x) = g (x) for all x  I. Show that there exists   R such that

                               g(x) = f (x) + 

for all x  I.

Exercise 6.3.9. Let D = R \ {0}. Define f : D  R and g : D  R by
f (x) = x2 and

                                 x2,      if x < 0,
               g(x) = x2 + 1, if x > 0.

Show that f (x) = g (x) for all x  D, but there does not exist   R such that
g(x) = f (x) +  for all x  D. Why does this not contradict the conclusion of

the previous exercise?

Proposition 6.3.5. If f is differentiable on (a, b) and f (x) > 0 for all x  (a, b),
then f is increasing on (a, b).

Proof. Let x, y  (a, b) with x < y. By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists
a point c  (x, y) such that

               f (y) - f (x) = (y - x)f (c).                      (6.3.13)

Since y - x > 0 and f (c) > 0, we have f (y) > f (x), and so f is increasing on

(a, b).                                                           Q.E.D.

then f is decreasing on (a, b).

Exercise 6.3.10. State and prove similar conditions for nonincreasing and

6.4 Discontinuities of derivatives

Theorem 6.4.1 (Intermediate Value Theorem for Derivatives). Suppose f is
differentiable on an open interval I, a, b  I, and a < b. If   R and either
f (a) <  < f (b) or f (a) >  > f (b), then there exists c  (a, b) such that
f (c) = .

Proof. Suppose f (a) <  < f (b) and define g : I  R by g(x) = f (x) - x.
Then g is differentiable on I, and so continuous on [a, b]. Let c be a point in
[a, b] at which g attains its minimum value. Now

                        g (a) = f (a) -  < 0,  (6.4.1)

so there exists a < t < b such that

                        g(t) - g(a) < 0.       (6.4.2)

Thus c = a. Similarly,

                        g (b) = f (b) -  > 0,  (6.4.3)

so there exists a < s < b such that

                        g(s) - g(b) < 0.       (6.4.4)

Thus c = b. Hence c  (a, b), and so g (c) = 0. Thus 0 = f (c) - , and so

f (c) = .                                      Q.E.D.

Exercise 6.4.1. Define g : (-1, 1)  R by

                                g(x) = -1, if - 1 < x < 0,
                                              1, if 0  x < 1.

Does there exist a function f : (-1, 1)  R such that f (x) = g(x) for all
x  (-1, 1)?

Exercise 6.4.2. Suppose f is differentiable on an open interval I. Show that
f cannot have any simple discontinuities in I.

Thus s (x) = 1 = (x - x ) when x is an integer, and so s (x) = (x - x ) for

all x  R.

      Also,  (x) = 12x - 6, so  (x) = 0 if and only if x = 12 . Since (0) = 1,
  1   = - 12 , and (1) = 1, we see that  attains a maximum value of 1 and a

minimum value of - 12 on the interval [0, 1]. Hence for any n  Z,

      It follows from the preceding, in the same manner as the result in Example

6.6 Taylor's Theorem

6.6.1 Derivatives of higher order

Definition 6.6.1. Suppose f is differentiable on an open interval I and f is
differentiable at a  I. We call the derivative of f at a the second derivative of
f at a, which we denote f (a).

    By continued differentiation, we may define the higher order derivatives f ,
f , and so on. In general, for any integer n, n  0, we let f (n) denote the nth
derivative of f , where f (0) denotes f .

Exercise 6.6.1. Suppose D  R, a is an interior point of D, f : D  R, and
f (a) exists. Show that

                lim     f (a + h) + f (a - h) - 2f (a)  = f (a).

                h0                h2

Find an example to illustrate that this limit may exist even if f (a) does not
exist.

    For any open interval (a, b), where a and b are extended real numbers, we
let C(n)(a, b), where n  Z+, denote the set of all functions f with the property
that each of f, f (1), f (2), . . . , f (n) is defined and continuous on (a, b).

Theorem 6.6.1 (Taylor's Theorem). Suppose f  C(n)(a, b) and f (n) is differ-
entiable on (a, b). Let ,   (a, b) with  = , and let

      P (x) = f () + f ()(x - ) + f () (x - )2 + · · ·                 (6.6.1)
                                                  2

                   + f (n)() (x - )n

             n = f (k)() (x - )k.
                         k!

                    k=0

Then there exists a point  between  and  such that

      f () = P () + f (n+1)() ( - )n+1.                                (6.6.2)
                           (n + 1)!

Proof. First note that P (k)() = f (k)() for k = 0, 1, . . . , n. Let

                                    f () - P ()
                                M=         n+1 .                       (6.6.3)
                                    ( - )

Then

                      f () = P () + M ( - )n+1.                        (6.6.4)
                                                                       (6.6.5)
We need to show that                   f (n+1)()
                                M=

                                        (n + 1)!

for some  between  and . Let

      g(x) = f (x) - P (x) - M (x - )n+1.                              (6.6.6)

Then, for k = 0, 1, . . . , n,

                      g(k)() = f (k)() - P (k)() = 0.                  (6.6.7)

Now g() = 0, so, by Rolle's theorem, there exists 1 between  and  such that

g (1) = 0. Using Rolle's theorem again, we see that there exists 2 between 

and 1 such that g (2) = 0. Continuing for n + 1 steps, we find n+1 between
 and n (and hence between  and ) such that g(n+1)(n+1) = 0. Hence

      0 = g(n+1)(n+1) = f (n+1)(n+1) - (n + 1)!M.                      (6.6.8)

Letting  = n+1, we have         M=  f (n+1)()  ,                        (6.6.9)
as required.                                                           Q.E.D.

    We call the polynomial P in the statement of Taylor's theorem the Taylor
polynomial of order n for f at .

                                       
Example 6.6.1. Let f (x) = x. Then the 4th order Taylor polynomial for f
at 1 is

P (x) = 1 + 1 (x - 1) - 1 (x - 1)2 + 1 (x - 1)3 - 5 (x - 1)4.

By Taylor's theorem, for any x > 0 there exists  between 1 and x such that

                         9 105 (x - 1)5 = P (x) + 9 7 (x - 1)5.

for some  with 1 <  < 1.2. Hence P (1.2) underestimates 1.2 by a value
which is no larger than 800000 7 . Note that

                         P (1.2) =   17527  = 1.0954375

                                     16000

and

                                                = 0.00000875.

                                      800000
    
So 1.2 lies between 1.0954375 and 1.09544625.

7.1 Upper and lower integrals

Definition 7.1.1. Given a closed interval [a, b]  R with a < b, we call any
finite subset of [a, b] which includes both a and b a partition of [a, b].

    For convenience, whenever we consider a partition P of an interval [a, b] we
will index the elements in increasing order, starting with 0. That is, if |P | = n+1
and P = {x0, x1, . . . , xn}, then

         a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xn = b.                   (7.1.1)

Definition 7.1.2. Suppose P = {x0, x1, . . . , xn} is a partition of [a, b] and
f : [a, b]  R is bounded. For i = 1, 2, . . . , n, let

         mi = inf{f (x) : xi-1  x  xi}                        (7.1.2)

and                                                           (7.1.3)
                              Mi = sup{f (x) : xi-1  x  xi}.  (7.1.4)

We call                         n                             (7.1.5)

           L(f, P ) = mi(xi - xi-1)

                               i=1

the lower sum of f determined by P and

                                 n

           U (f, P ) = Mi(xi - xi-1)

                               i=1

Definition 7.1.3. If P1 and P2 are both partitions of [a, b] and P1  P2, then
we call P2 a refinement of P1.

Definition 7.1.4. If P1 and P2 are both partitions of [a, b], then we call the
partition P = P1  P2 the common refinement of P1 and P2.

Lemma 7.1.1. Suppose P1 = {x0, x1, . . . , xn} is a partition of [a, b], s  (a, b),
s / P1, and f : [a, b]  R is bounded. If P2 = P1 {s}, then L(f, P1)  L(f, P2)
and U (f, P2)  U (f, P1).

Proof. Suppose xi-1 < s < xi and let

        w1 = inf{f (x) : xi-1  x  s},                                     (7.1.6)
        W1 = sup{f (x) : xi-1  x  s},                                     (7.1.7)
        w2 = inf{f (x) : s  x  xi},                                       (7.1.8)
        W2 = sup{f (x) : s  x  xi},                                       (7.1.9)
        mi = inf{f (x) : xi-1  x  xi},                                   (7.1.10)

and                                                                      (7.1.11)
                              Mi = sup{f (x) : xi-1  x  xi}.

Then w1  mi, w2  mi, W1  Mi, and W2  Mi. Hence

L(f, P2) - L(f, P1) = w1(s - xi-1) + w2(xi - s) - mi(xi - xi-1)          (7.1.12)
                         = w1(s - xi-1) + w2(xi - s) - mi(s - xi-1)
                               - mi(xi - s)
                         = (w1 - mi)(s - xi-1) + (w2 - mi)(xi - s)
                         0

and                                                                      (7.1.13)

   U (f, P1) - U (f, P2) = Mi(xi - xi-1) - W1(s - xi-1) - W2(xi - s)
                             = Mi(s - xi-1) + Mi(xi - s) - W1(s - xi-1)
                                   - W2(xi - s)
                             = (Mi - W1)(s - xi-1) + (Mi - W2)(xi - s)
                              0.

Thus L(f, P1)  L(f, P2) and U (f, P2)  U (f, P1).                        Q.E.D.

Proposition 7.1.2. Suppose P1 and P2 are partitions of [a, b], with P2 a re-

finement of P1. If f : [a, b]  R is bounded, then L(f, P1)  L(f, P2) and
U (f, P2)  U (f, P1).

Proof. The proposition follows immediately from repeated use of the previous

lemma.                                                                   Q.E.D.

Proposition 7.1.3. Suppose P1 and P2 are partitions of [a, b]. If f : [a, b]  R
is bounded, then L(f, P1)  U (f, P2).
7.1. UPPER AND LOWER INTEGRALS                                         101

Proof. The result follows immediately from the definitions if P1 = P2. Other-
wise, let P be the common refinement of P1 and P2. Then

L(f, P1)  L(f, P )  U (f, P )  U (f, P2).          (7.1.14)

                                                   Q.E.D.

Definition 7.1.5. Suppose a < b and f : [a, b]  R is bounded. We call

 b                                                 (7.1.15)

  f = sup{L(f, P ) : P is a partition of [a, b]}

a

the lower integral of f over [a, b] and

 b                                                 (7.1.16)

  f = inf{U (f, P ) : P is a partition of [a, b]}

a

the upper integral of f over [a, b].

    Note that both the lower integral and the upper integral are finite real num-
bers since the lower sums are all bounded above by any upper sum and the
upper sums are all bounded below by any lower sum.

Proposition 7.1.4. Suppose a < b and f : [a, b]  R is bounded. Then

                                         b     b

                                            f  f.  (7.1.17)

                                      a     a

Proof. Let P be a partition of [a, b]. Then for any partition Q of [a, b], we have
L(f, Q)  U (f, P ). Hence U (f, P ) is an upper bound for any lower sum, and so

 b                                                 (7.1.18)

  f  U (f, P ).

But this shows that the lower integral is a lower bound for any upper sum.

7.2 Integrals

Definition 7.2.1. Suppose a < b and f : [a, b]  R is bounded. We say f is
integrable on [a, b] if

                                           b               b

                                              f = f.                           (7.2.1)

                                        a               a

If f is integrable, we call the common value of the upper and lower integrals the

integral of f over [a, b], denoted

                                                 b

                                                    f.                         (7.2.2)

                                              a

That is, if f is integrable on [a, b],

                  b                              b                          b

                                    f = f = f.                                 (7.2.3)

               a                              a                          a

Example 7.2.1. Define f : [0, 1]  R by

               f (x) = 1, if x  Q,
                           0, if x / Q.

For any partition P = {x0, x1, . . . , xn}, we have

                                    n

               L(f, P ) = 0(xi - xi-1) = 0

                                   i=1

and n
                         U (f, P ) = (xi - xi-1) = xn - x0 = 1.

                                                        i=1

Thus                                           1

                                                f =0

                                              0

and

                                                                      1

                                                  f = 1.

                                                                    0

Hence f is not integrable on [0, 1].

Example 7.2.2. Let   R, a < b, and define f : [a, b]  R by f (x) =  for
all x  [a, b]. For any partition P = {x0, x1, . . . , xn}, we have

                           n

      L(f, P ) = (xi - xi-1) = (xn - x0) = (b - a)

                 U (f, P ) = (xi - xi-1) = (xn - x0) = (b - a).

Theorem 7.2.1. Suppose a < b and f : [a, b]  R is bounded. Then f is
integrable on [a, b] if and only if for every > 0 there exists a partition P of

[a, b] such that

Let P be the common refinement of P1 and P2. Then

    U (f, P ) - L(f, P )  U (f, P2) - L(f, P1)                                              b

That is, f is integrable on [a, b].

Example  7.2.3.  Suppose  f : [0, 1]  R    is defined by
                                     
                                     0,             1
                                            if x = ,
                           f (x) =
                                     1,             2
                                                    1
                                            if x = .
                                                    2

If P is a partition of [0, 1], then clearly L(f, P ) = 0. Given > 0, let

                          P = {0, 1 - , 1 + , 1}.
                                     2 42 4

Then                             1         - 1-
                 U (f, P ) = +

                                  24          24 2

Hence U (f, P ) - L(f, P ) < , so f is integrable on [0, 1]. Moreover,

7.2.1 Notation and terminology

The definition of the integral described in this section is due to Darboux. One
may show it to be equivalent to the integral defined by Riemann. Hence func-
tions that are integrable in the sense of this discussion are referred to as Riemann
integrable functions and we call the integral the Riemann integral . This is in
distinction to the Lebesgue integral , part of a more general theory of integration.

    We sometimes refer to this integral as the definite integral , as opposed to an
indefinite integral , the latter being a name given to an antiderivative (a function
whose derivative is equal to a given function).

    If f is integrable on [a, b], then we will also denote

                                          b

                                             f                (7.2.13)

The variable x in the latter is a "dummy" variable; we may just as well write

                                                                      b       (7.2.15)

7.3 Integrability conditions

Proposition 7.3.1. If a < b and f : [a, b]  R is monotonic, then f is integrable
on [a, b].

Proof. Suppose f is nondecreasing. Given > 0, let n  Z+ be large enough

that                               (f (b) - f (a))(b - a) < .

For i = 0, 1, . . . , n, let

                                         xi = a + (b - a)i .                  (7.3.2)
                                                         n

Let P = {x0, x1, . . . , xn}. Then

                              n                         n

U (f, P ) - L(f, P ) = f (xi)(xi - xi-1) - f (xi-1)(xi - xi-1)

                              i=1                       i=1

                      n b-a
                  = (f (xi) - f (xi-1)) n

                      i=1

                  = b - a ((f (x1) - f (x0)) + (f (x2) - f (x1)) + · · ·
                       n

                              + (f (xn-1) - f (xn-2)) + (f (xn) - f (xn-1)))

                  = b - a (f (b) - f (a))
                       n

                  <.                                                          (7.3.3)

Hence f is integrable on [a, b].                                              Q.E.D.

Example 7.3.1. Let  : Q[0, 1]  Z+ be a one-to-one correspondence. Define

f : [0, 1]  R by                                        1

                                      f (x) =           2(q) .

                                                  qx

Then f is increasing on [0, 1], and hence integrable on [0, 1].

Proposition 7.3.2. If a < b and f : [a, b]  R is continuous, then f is inte-
grable on [a, b].

Proof. Given > 0, let

                                        = b - a.                          (7.3.4)

Since f is uniformly continuous on [a, b], we may choose  > 0 such that

                                   |f (x) - f (y)| <                      (7.3.5)

whenever |x - y| < . Let P = {x0, x1, . . . , xn} be a partition with

                              sup{|xi - xi-1| : i = 1, 2, . . . , n} < .  (7.3.6)

If, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n,

                              mi = inf{f (x) : xi-1  x  xi}               (7.3.7)

and                                                                       (7.3.8)
                              Mi = sup{f (x) : xi-1  x  xi},              (7.3.9)

then Mi - mi < . Hence

                              n                        n

U (f, P ) - L(f, P ) = Mi(xi - xi-1) - mi(xi - xi-1)

                              i=1                      i=1

                              n

                              = (Mi - mi)(xi - xi-1)

                                  i=1
                                       n

                              <  (xi - xi-1)

                                  i=1

                              = (b - a)

                              =.

Thus f is integrable on [a, b].                                           Q.E.D.

Proof. Given > 0, let P1 and P2 be partitions of [a, b] with

                                    U (f, P1) - L(f, P1) < 2                (7.4.4)

                                    U (g, P2) - L(g, P2) < 2 .
Let P = P1  P2. By the previous proposition,

                              U (f + g, P )  U (f, P ) + U (g, P )

and

       L(f + g, P )  L(f, P ) + L(g, P ).                                   (7.4.7)

Hence

U (f + g, P ) - L(f + g, P )  (U (f, P ) + U (g, P )) - (L(f, P ) + L(g, P ))

          = (U (f, P ) - L(f, P )) + (U (g, P ) - L(g, P ))

Exercise 7.4.5. Prove the previous proposition.

Proposition 7.4.4. Suppose a < b, f : [a, b]  R is bounded, and c  (a, b).
Then f is integrable on [a, b] if and only if f is integrable on both [a, c] and

[c, b].

Proof. Suppose f is integrable on [a, b]. Given > 0, let Q be a partition of

[a, b] such that

                        U (f, Q) - L(f, Q) < .                                   (7.4.13)

Let P = Q  {c}, P1 = P  [a, c], and P2 = P  [c, b]. Then

(U (f, P1) - L(f, P1)) + (U (f, P2) - L(f, P2)) = (U (f, P1) + U (f, P2))
                                                                  - (L(f, P1) + L(f, P2))

                                                            = U (f, P ) - L(f, P )
                                                             U (f, Q) - L(f, Q)

Thus we must have both

                        U (f, P1) - L(f, P1) <                                   (7.4.15)

                                    U (f, P2) - L(f, P2) < .

Hence f is integrable on both [a, c] and [c, b].

    Now suppose f is integrable on both [a, c] and [c, b]. Given > 0, let P1 and

Let P = P1  P2. Then P is a partition of [a, b] and

7.5.1 The other Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Proposition 7.5.3. Suppose f is integrable on [a, b] and F : [a, b]  R is

defined by

                                                                            x

                    F (x) = f (t)dt.                                                                       (7.5.10)

                           a

Then F is uniformly continuous on [a, b].

Proof. Let > 0 be given and let M > 0 be such that |f (x)|  M for all
x  [a, b]. Then for any x, y  [a, b] with x < y and y - x < M ,

   |F (y) - F (x)| =    y                                                                                  (7.5.11)

                          f (t)dt  M (y - x) < .

                       x

Hence F is uniformly continuous on [a, b].                                                                 Q.E.D.

    The following theorem is often considered to be part of the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus.

Theorem 7.5.4. Suppose f is integrable on [a, b] and continuous at u  (a, b).
If F : [a, b]  R is defined by

                                       x                                                                   (7.5.12)

                    F (x) = f (t)dt,

                                     a

then F is differentiable at u and F (u) = f (u).

Proof. Let > 0 be given and choose  > 0 such that |f (x) - f (u)| <
whenever |x - u| < . Then if 0 < h < , we have

F (u + h) - F (u) - f (u) = 1 u+h f (t)dt - f (u)
   h                      hu

                       =  1 u+h                                                (f (t) - f (u))dt

                          hu

                       <.                                                                                  (7.5.13)

If - < h < 0, then

F (u + h) - F (u) - f (u) = - 1 u f (t)dt - f (u)
h                       h u+h

                    =  1u                                                      f (t)dt + f (u)

                       h u+h

                    =  1u                                                      f (t)dt -  1u      f (u)dt

                       h u+h                                                              h u+h

                    =  1u                                                      (f (t) - f (u))dt

                    <.                                                                                     (7.5.14)

Hence

                 F (u) = lim F (u + h) - F (u) = f (u).                 (7.5.15)

Proposition 7.5.5. If a < b and f is continuous on [a, b], then there exists a

function F : [a, b]  R which is continuous on [a, b] with F (x) = f (x) for all
x  (a, b).

Proof. Let

                                              x                         (7.5.16)

                           F (x) = f (t)dt.

Example 7.5.1. If                            x        1 + t4 dt,
                 
                           g(x) =
then g (x) = 1 + x4.
                                           0

Proposition 7.5.6 (Integration by substitution). Suppose I is an open interval,

 : I  R, a < b, [a, b]  I, and  is continuous on [a, b]. If f : ([a, b])  R is
continuous, then

                      (b)                          b

                           f (u)du = f ((x)) (x)dx.                     (7.5.17)

                      (a)                       a

Proof. If m and M are the minimum and maximum values, respectively, of 
on [a, b], then ([a, b]) = [m, M ]. If m = M , then (x) = m for all x  [a, b], and
both sides of (7.5.17) are 0. So we may assume m < M . Let F be a function
which is continuous on [m, M ] with F (u) = f (u) for every u  (m, M ). Let
g = F  . Then

                 g (x) = F ((x)) (x) = f ((x)) (x).                     (7.5.18)

So if (a)  (b),

                  b

                    f ((x)) (x)dx = g(b) - g(a)

7.6 Taylor's theorem revisited

The following is a version of Taylor's Theorem with an alternative form of the
remainder term.

Theorem 7.6.1 (Taylor's Theorem). Suppose f  C(n+1)(a, b),   (a, b), and

                          Pn(x) =  n f (k)()                                         (x - )k.       (7.6.1)

                                   k=0  k!

Then, for any x  (a, b),

                f (x) = Pn(x) +         x f (n+1)(t)                                 (x - t)ndt.    (7.6.2)

                                      n!

Proof. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have

                           x                                                                        (7.6.3)

                             f (t)dt = f (x) - f (),

                          

which implies that

                                                                                  x

                          f (x) = f () + f (t)dt.                                                   (7.6.4)

                                                        

Hence the theorem holds for n = 0. Suppose the result holds for n = k - 1, that

is,

                f (x) = Pk-1(x) +       x f (k)(t)                                   (x - t)k-1dt.  (7.6.5)

                                         (k - 1)!

Let

                            F (t) = f (k)(t),                                                       (7.6.6)

                                   (x - t)k-1                                                       (7.6.7)
                          g(t) = (k - 1)! ,

and                       G(t) = - (x - t)k .                                                       (7.6.8)
Then                                      k!

     x f (k)(t) x (x - t)k-1dt = F (t)g(t)dt
      (k - 1)!
                          

                                                                                               x

                          = F (x)G(x) - F ()G() - F (t)G(t)dt

                                                                                               

                          = f (k)()(x - )k x + f (k+1)(t) (x - t)kdt.                               (7.6.9)
                                   k!                                                 k!

Hence                                   x f (k+1)(t)

                f (x) = Pk(x) +       k!                                             (x - t)kdt,    (7.6.10)
                                                                                                    Q.E.D.
and so the theorem holds for n = k.

Exercise 7.7.1. Prove the preceding proposition.

Example 7.7.1. Suppose

                                        1
                           f (x) = 1 + x2

and                        

                            1, if 0  x < 1,

                           g(x) =  2 1 , if x  1.
                                       x

Then, for b > 1,

     b 1 b1                                          1    1
     0 0 1 g(x)dx = dx + x2 dx = 1 + 1 - b = 2 - b ,

so                         + 1

                           g(x)dx = lim 2 - = 2.

                        0

Since 0 < f (x)  g(x) for all x  0, it follows that

                           0 1 + x2 dx

                           0 1 + x2 dx < 2.

Also, the substitution u = -x shows that

8.1 The arctangent function

Definition 8.1.1. For any x  R, we call                            (8.1.1)

the arctangent of x.

Proposition 8.1.1. The arctangent function is differentiable at every x  R.
Moreover, if f (x) = arctan(x), then

Proof. The result follows immediately from Theorem 7.5.4.          Q.E.D.

Proposition 8.1.2. The arctangent is increasing on R.

Proof. The result follows immediately from the previous proposition and the

fact that                    1

    The following proposition says that the arctangent function is an odd func-
tion.

     0 arctan(x) = 1 + t2 0 dt = - 1 + u2 du = - arctan(-x).                    (8.1.4)

     It now follows that

                  lim arctan(x) = - lim arctan(-x) = -  .                      (8.1.5)

Hence the range of the arctangent function is - 2 , 2 .

Proposition 8.1.4. If x > 0, then

8.2 The tangent function

Let                 A =  + n : n  Z

and D = R \ A. Let  t : -,   R

                                                               (8.2.2)

be the inverse of the arctangent function. Note that t is increasing and differ-

entiable on - 2 , 2 . We may extend t to a function on D as follows: For any
x  D, let

                    g(x) = sup n : n  Z, -  + n < x            (8.2.3)
                                                    2

and define T (x) = t(x - g(x)).

Definition 8.2.1. With the notation of the above discussion, for any x  D,
we call the value T (x) the tangent of x, which we denote tan(x).

Proposition 8.2.1. The tangent function has domain D (as defined above),

range R, and is differentiable at every point x  D. Moreover, the tangent
function is increasing on each interval of the form

                    -  + n,  + n ,                             (8.2.4)

Definition 8.2.2. Let E  R. We say a function f : E  R is periodic if
there exists a real number p > 0 such that, for each x  E, x + p  E and

f (x + p) = f (x). We say p is the period of a periodic function f if p is the

smallest positive number for which f (x + p) = f (x) for all x  E.

Proof. Suppose y1, y2  - 2 , 2 with y1 + y2  - 2 , 2 . Let x1 = tan(y1)
and x2 = tan(y2). Note that if x1 > 0, then x1x2  1 would imply that

                                   x1

that                        x2  1 ,

                            x1                      (8.2.10)

u is a number between -x1 and x2. If x1 > 0, then

                             -x1 = 1 + u2 0 du + 1 + u2 du

                                        0

                             = - arctan(-x1) + arctan(x2)

                             = arctan(x1) + arctan(x2).

    Now suppose y1, y2       - 2 , 2       with y1 + y2 > 2 . Then y1 + y2  2 ,  ,
x1 > 0, x2 > 0, and
                                                   1
                                           x2 > x1 .                                   (8.2.24)

With u and x as above, note then that as u increases from -x1 to x1 1 , t increases
                                                  1
from  0  to  +,  and  as  u  increases     from   x1  to  x2,    t  increases    from  -  to  x.

Hence we have

               x1                  01                     + 1
    0 arctan(x) +  = 1 + t2 - dt + 1 + t2 0 dt + 1 + t2 dt

               x1                  + 1
               - = 1 + t2 0 dt + 1 + t2 dt

               x2 1                 1

                                   x1 1
               x1 = 1 + u2 -x1 du + 1 + u2 du
               1

                     x2 1
               -x1 = 1 + u2 du

               = arctan(x2) - arctan(-x1)

               = arctan(x2) + arctan(x1).                      (8.2.25)

Hence

               tan(y1 + y2) = tan(y1 + y2 - )                  (8.2.26)
                               = tan(arctan(x))
                               = x1 + x2
                                   1 - x1x2
                               = tan(y1) + tan(y2) .
                                   1 - tan(y1) tan(y2)

    The case when x1 < 0 may be handled similarly; it then follows that the
addition formula holds for all y1, y2  - 2 , 2 . The case for arbitrary y1, y2  D
with y1 + y2  D then follows from the periodicity of the tangent function.

                                                                                                         Q.E.D.

Note that

which shows that both s and c are continuous functions.
    Next, we extend the definitions of s and c to functions

and                          C : -  , 3  R                         (8.3.8)
by defining                            22                          (8.3.9)

Note that

which shows that both S and C are continuous at 2 . Thus both S and C are
continuous.

    Finally, for any x  R, let

and

                             cos(x) = C(x - 2g(x)).                (8.3.15)
130                                        CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS

Definition 8.3.1. With the notation as above, for any x  R, we call sin(x)
and cos(x) the sine and cosine of x, respectively.

Proposition 8.3.1. The sine and cosine functions are continuous on R.
Proof. From the definitions, it is sufficient to verify continuity at 23 . Now

     lim sin(x) = lim S(x) = S 3 = -s  = -1                       (8.3.16)
     x 2 3 -  x 2 3 -                         2             2

and

              lim sin(x) = lim S(x - 2)
              x 2 3 +                x 2 3 +

                                     = lim s(x)

                                         x-  + 2

                                     = lim           y
                                                    1 + y2
                                         y-

                                     = lim          1

and so sine is continuous at 23 . Similarly,

                                     = lim           1
                                        y- -         y

                                                    1 + y2 1

                                     = 0,                         (8.3.19)

and so cosine is continuous at 23 .                               Q.E.D.

132                                  CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS

Then

cos2(x + y) = 21
                   1 + tan (x + y)

       =              1
          1+   tan(x) + tan(y) 2
              1 - tan(x) tan(y)

                        (1 - tan(x) tan(y))2
       = (1 - tan(x) tan(y))2 + (tan(x) + tan(y))2

              (1 - tan(x) tan(y))2
       = (1 + tan2(x))(1 + tan2(y))

                                                                       2

       = (cos(x) cos(y) - sin(x) sin(y))2.

Hence

       cos(x + y) = ±(cos(x) cos(y) - sin(x) sin(y)).      (8.3.26)

Consider a fixed value of x. Note that the positive sign must be chosen when
y = 0. Moreover, increasing y by  changes the sign on both sides, so the
positive sign must be chosen when y is any multiple of . Since sine and cosine
are continuous functions,the choice of sign could change only at points at which
both sides are 0, but these points are separated by a distance of , so we must
always choose the positive sign. Hence we have

              cos(x + y) = cos(x) cos(y) - sin(x) sin(y)   (8.3.27)

for all x, y  R for which x, y, and x + y are in the domain of the tangent
function. The identity for the other values of x and y now follows from the

continuity of the sine and cosine functions.               Q.E.D.

Proposition 8.3.9. For any x, y  R,

Proposition 8.4.4. If r  Q and x is a positive real number, then        (8.4.8)
                                        log(xr) = r log(x).

Proof. Using the substitution t = ur, we have

       log(xr) =  xr 1        x rur-1              x1                    (8.4.9)

Proof. Given a real number M , choose an integer n for which n log(2) > M
(there exists such an n since log(2) > 0). Then for any x > 2n, we have

                      log(x) > log(2n) = n log(2) > M.                  (8.4.10)

Hence lim log(x) = +.

            x+

    Similarly, given any real number M , we may choose an integer n for which
-n log(2) < M . Then for any 0 < x < 2n 1 , we have

                                     1                                  (8.4.11)
                  log(x) < log n = -n log(2) < M.

                                     2

Hence lim log(x) = -.                                                   Q.E.D.

8.5 The exponential function

Definition 8.5.1. We call the inverse of the logarithm function the exponential
function. We denote the value of the exponential function at a real number x
by exp(x).

Proposition 8.5.1. The exponential function has domain R and range (0, +).
Moreover, the exponential function is increasing and differentiable on R. If
f (x) = exp(x), then f (x) = exp(x).

Proof. Only the final statement of the proposition requires proof.  If we let
                                                                      (8.5.1)
g(x) = log(x), then

                      f (x) =   1           = exp(x).

                                g (exp(x))

                                                                    Q.E.D.

Proposition 8.5.2. For any real numbers x and y,

                      exp(x + y) = exp(x) exp(y).                   (8.5.2)

Proof. The result follows from

log(exp(x) exp(y)) = log(exp(x)) + log(exp(y)) = x + y.             (8.5.3)

                                                                    Q.E.D.
8.5. THE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION                                             139

Proposition 8.5.3. For any real number x,                             (8.5.4)
                                       exp(-x) = 1 .                  (8.5.5)
                                                       exp(x)        Q.E.D.

Proof. The result follows from
                           log 1 = - log(exp(x)) = -x.
                                  exp(x)

Exercise 8.5.1. Use Taylor's theorem to show that

exp(1) = e =  1                                           .          (8.5.6)

              n=0 n!

Proposition 8.5.4. For any rational number ,                         (8.5.7)
                                            exp() = e.

Proof. Since log(e) = 1, we have                                     (8.5.8)
                                     log(e) =  log(e) = .

Definition 8.5.2. If  is an irrational number, we define             Q.E.D.
                                           e = exp().                 (8.5.9)

Note that for any real numbers x and y,                              (8.5.10)
                                       ex+y = exey

and                                                                  (8.5.11)
                                             e-x = ex1 .

Moreover, log(ex) = x and, if x > 0, elog(x) = x.

Definition 8.5.3. If x and a are real numbers with a > 0, we define

ax = ex log(a).                                                      (8.5.12)

Show that f (x) = axa-1.

Proof. We know that                       log(y)            (8.5.14)
Hence                              lim 1 = 0.               (8.5.15)
Letting y = ex, we have           y+ y                      (8.5.16)

                         x+               x

Proof. First note that, letting x = 1h ,

     lim 1 +  x = lim (1 + h) h1 = lim e h1 log(1+h).       (8.5.18)
     x+        x         h0+                     h0+

Using l'H^opital's rule, we have

               lim       log(1 + h)       = lim        = ,  (8.5.19)

               h0+                h       h0+ 1 + h

and the result follows from the continuity of the exponential function. Q.E.D.
