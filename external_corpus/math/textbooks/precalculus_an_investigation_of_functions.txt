About the Authors

                          David Lippman received his master's degree
                          in mathematics from Western Washington
                          University and has been teaching at Pierce
                          College since Fall 2000.

                          Melonie Rasmussen also received her
                          master's degree in mathematics from
                          Western Washington University and has
                          been teaching at Pierce College since Fall
                          2002. Prior to this Melonie taught for the
Puyallup School district for 6 years after receiving her teaching credentials from Pacific
Lutheran University.

We have both been long time advocates of open learning, open materials, and basically
any idea that will reduce the cost of education for students. It started by supporting the
college's calculator rental program, and running a book loan scholarship program.
Eventually the frustration with the escalating costs of commercial text books and the
online homework systems that charged for access led them to take action.

First, David developed IMathAS, open source online math homework software that runs
WAMAP.org and MyOpenMath.com. Through this platform, we became integral parts
of a vibrant sharing and learning community of teachers from around Washington State
that support and contribute to WAMAP. Our pioneering efforts, supported by dozens of
other dedicated faculty and financial support from the WA-SBCTC, have led to a system
used by thousands of students every quarter, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars over
comparable commercial offerings.

David continued further and wrote his first open textbook, Math in Society, a math for
liberal arts majors book, after being frustrated by students having to pay $100+ for a
textbook for a terminal course. Together, frustrated by both cost and the style of
commercial texts, we began writing PreCalculus: An Investigation of Functions in 2010.
Since then, David has contributed to several other open texts.

Preface

Over the years, when reviewing books we found that many had been mainstreamed by
the publishers in an effort to appeal to everyone, leaving them with very little
character. There were only a handful of books that had the conceptual and application
driven focus we liked, and most of those were lacking in other aspects we cared about,
like providing students sufficient examples and practice of basic skills. The largest
frustration, however, was the never ending escalation of cost and being forced into new
editions every three years. We began researching open textbooks, however the ability for
those books to be adapted, remixed, or printed were often limited by the types of licenses,
or didn't approach the material the way we wanted.

This book is available online for free, in both Word and PDF format. You are free to
change the wording, add materials and sections or take them away. We welcome
feedback, comments and suggestions for future development at
precalc@opentextbookstore.com. Additionally, if you add a section, chapter or problems,
we would love to hear from you and possibly add your materials so everyone can benefit.

In writing this book, our focus was on the story of functions. We begin with function
notation, a basic toolkit of functions, and the basic operation with functions: composition
and transformation. Building from these basic functions, as each new family of functions
is introduced we explore the important features of the function: its graph, domain and
range, intercepts, and asymptotes. The exploration then moves to evaluating and solving
equations involving the function, finding inverses, and culminates with modeling using
the function.

The "rule of four" is integrated throughout - looking at the functions verbally,
graphically, numerically, as well as algebraically. We feel that using the "rule of four"
gives students the tools they need to approach new problems from various angles. Often
the "story problems of life" do not always come packaged in a neat equation. Being able
to think critically, see the parts and build a table or graph a trend, helps us change the
words into meaningful and measurable functions that model the world around us.

There is nothing we hate more than a chapter on exponential equations that begins
"Exponential functions are functions that have the form f(x)=ax." As each family of
functions is introduced, we motivate the topic by looking at how the function arises from
life scenarios or from modeling. Also, we feel it is important that precalculus be the
bridge in level of thinking between algebra and calculus. In algebra, it is common to see
numerous examples with very similar homework exercises, encouraging the student
to mimic the examples. Precalculus provides a link that takes students from the basic
plug & chug of formulaic calculations towards building an understanding that equations
and formulas have deeper meaning and purpose. While you will find examples and
similar exercises for the basic skills in this book, you will also find examples of multistep
problem solving along with exercises in multistep problem solving. Often times these
exercises will not exactly mimic the exercises, forcing the students to employ their
critical thinking skills and apply the skills they've learned to new situations. By
iv

developing students' critical thinking and problem solving skills this course prepares
students for the rigors of Calculus.

While we followed a fairly standard ordering of material in the first half of the book, we
took some liberties in the trig portion of the book. It is our opinion that there is no need
to separate unit circle trig from triangle trig, and instead integrated them in the first
chapter. Identities are introduced in the first chapter, and revisited throughout. Likewise,
solving is introduced in the second chapter and revisited more extensively in the third
chapter. As with the first part of the book, an emphasis is placed on motivating the
concepts and on modeling and interpretation.

About the Second Edition

About 4 years and several minor typo revisions after the original release of this book, we
started contemplating creating a second edition. We didn't want to change much; we've
always found it very annoying when new editions change things just for the sake of
making it seem different. However, in talking with instructors from around the country,
we knew there were a few topics that we had left out that other schools need. We didn't
want to suffer the same "content bloat" that many commercial books do, but we also
wanted to make it easier for more schools to adopt open resources.

We put our plans for a new revision on hold after OpenStax started working on a
precalculus book, using the first edition of this text as a base. After the final product
came out, though, we felt it had strayed a bit far from our original vision. We had written
this text, not to be an encyclopedic reference text, but to be a concise, easy-to-read,
student-friendly approach to precalculus. We valued contextual motivation and
conceptual understanding over procedural skills. Our book took, in places, a non-
traditional approach to topics and content ordering. Ultimately, we decided to go ahead
with this second edition.

The primary changes in the second edition are:
     New, higher resolution graphs throughout
     New sections added to Chapter 3:
             o 3.4 Factor theorem (includes long division of polynomials)
             o 3.5 Real zeros of polynomials (using rational roots theorem)
             o 3.6 Complex zeros of polynomials
     Coverage of oblique asymptotes added to the rational equations section (now 3.7)
     A new section 8.5 on dot product of vectors
     A new chapter 9 on conic sections

There were many additional refinements, some new examples added, and Try it Now
answers expanded, but most of the book remains unchanged.

Instructor Resources

As part of the Washington Open Course Library project, we developed a full course
package to accompany this text. The course shell was built for the IMathAS online
homework platform, and is available for Washington State faculty at www.wamap.org
and mirrored for others at www.myopenmath.com. It contains:

     Online homework for each section (algorithmically generated, free response),
         most with video help associated.

     Video lessons for each section. The videos were mostly created and selected by
         James Sousa, of Mathispower4u.

     A selection of printable class worksheets, activities, and handouts
     Support materials for an example course (does not include all sections):

             o Suggested syllabus and Day by day course guide
             o Instructor guide with lecture outlines and examples
             o Discussion forums
             o Diagnostic review
             o Chapter review problems
             o Sample quizzes and sample chapter exams

The course shell was designed to follow Quality Matters (QM) guidelines, but has not yet
been formally reviewed.

Getting Started

To get started using this textbook and the online supplementary materials,
     Request an instructor account on WAMAP (in Washington) or MyOpenMath
         (outside Washington).
     Review the table of contents of the text, and compare it to your course outcomes
         or student learning objectives. Determine which sections you will need to cover,
         and which to omit. If there are topics in your outcomes that are not in the text,
         explore other sources like the Stitz/Zeager Precalc or OpenStax Precalc to
         supplement from. Also check the book's website, as we may offer additional
         online-only topics.
     Once your instructor account is approved, log in, and click Add New Course
     From the "Use content from a template course", select "Precalculus -
         Lippman/Rasmussen 2nd Ed". Note that you might also see two half-book
         templates, one covering chapters 1 - 4, and the other covering chapters 5 - 9.
     Once you have copied the course, go through and remove any sections you don't
         need for your course. Refer to the Training Course Quickstart videos in
         MyOpenMath and WAMAP for more details on how to make those changes.

How To Be Successful In This Course

This is not a high school math course, although for some of you the content may seem
familiar. There are key differences to what you will learn here, how quickly you will be
required to learn it and how much work will be required of you.

You will no longer be shown a technique and be asked to mimic it repetitively as the only
way to prove learning. Not only will you be required to master the technique, but you
will also be required to extend that knowledge to new situations and build bridges
between the material at hand and the next topic, making the course highly cumulative.

As a rule of thumb, for each hour you spend in class, you should expect this course will
require an average of 2 hours of out-of-class focused study. This means that some of you
with a stronger background in mathematics may take less, but if you have a weaker
background or any math anxiety it will take you more.

Notice how this is the equivalent of having a part time job, and if you are taking a
fulltime load of courses as many college students do, this equates to more than a full time
job. If you must work, raise a family and take a full load of courses all at the same time,
we recommend that you get a head start & get organized as soon as possible. We also
recommend that you spread out your learning into daily chunks and avoid trying to cram
or learn material quickly before an exam.

To be prepared, read through the material before it is covered in class and note or
highlight the material that is new or confusing. The instructor's lecture and activities
should not be the first exposure to the material. As you read, test your understanding
with the Try it Now problems in the book. If you can't figure one out, try again after
class, and ask for help if you still can't get it.

As soon as possible after the class session recap the day's lecture or activities into a
meaningful format to provide a third exposure to the material. You could summarize
your notes into a list of key points, or reread your notes and try to work examples done in
class without referring back to your notes. Next, begin any assigned homework. The
next day, if the instructor provides the opportunity to clarify topics or ask questions, do
not be afraid to ask. If you are afraid to ask, then you are not getting your money's
worth! If the instructor does not provide this opportunity, be prepared to go to a tutoring
center or build a peer study group. Put in quality effort and time and you can get quality
results.

Lastly, if you feel like you do not understand a topic. Don't wait, ASK FOR HELP!

ASK: Ask a teacher or tutor, Search for ancillaries, Keep a detailed list of questions
FOR: Find additional resources, Organize the material, Research other learning options
HELP: Have a support network, Examine your weaknesses, List specific examples & Practice

Best of luck learning! We hope you like the course & love the price.
David & Melonie

Section 1.1 Functions and Function Notation

What is a Function?
The natural world is full of relationships between quantities that change. When we see
these relationships, it is natural for us to ask "If I know one quantity, can I then determine
the other?" This establishes the idea of an input quantity, or independent variable, and a
corresponding output quantity, or dependent variable. From this we get the notion of a
functional relationship in which the output can be determined from the input.

For some quantities, like height and age, there are certainly relationships between these
quantities. Given a specific person and any age, it is easy enough to determine their
height, but if we tried to reverse that relationship and determine age from a given height,
that would be problematic, since most people maintain the same height for many years.

 Function
 Function: A rule for a relationship between an input, or independent, quantity and an
 output, or dependent, quantity in which each input value uniquely determines one
 output value. We say "the output is a function of the input."

Example 1
 In the height and age example above, is height a function of age? Is age a function of
 height?

 In the height and age example above, it would be correct to say that height is a function
 of age, since each age uniquely determines a height. For example, on my 18th birthday,
 I had exactly one height of 69 inches.

 However, age is not a function of height, since one height input might correspond with
 more than one output age. For example, for an input height of 70 inches, there is more
 than one output of age since I was 70 inches at the age of 20 and 21.

Example 2
 At a coffee shop, the menu consists of items and their prices. Is price a function of the
 item? Is the item a function of the price?

 We could say that price is a function of the item, since each input of an item has one
 output of a price corresponding to it. We could not say that item is a function of price,
 since two items might have the same price.

Example 3
 In many classes the overall percentage you earn in the course corresponds to a decimal
 grade point. Is decimal grade a function of percentage? Is percentage a function of
 decimal grade?

 For any percentage earned, there would be a decimal grade associated, so we could say
 that the decimal grade is a function of percentage. That is, if you input the percentage,
 your output would be a decimal grade. Percentage may or may not be a function of
 decimal grade, depending upon the teacher's grading scheme. With some grading
 systems, there are a range of percentages that correspond to the same decimal grade.

 One-to-One Function
 Sometimes in a relationship each input corresponds to exactly one output, and every
 output corresponds to exactly one input. We call this kind of relationship a one-to-
 one function.

From Example 3, if each unique percentage corresponds to one unique decimal grade
point and each unique decimal grade point corresponds to one unique percentage then it
is a one-to-one function.

Try it Now
Let's consider bank account information.
1. Is your balance a function of your bank account number?

    (if you input a bank account number does it make sense that the output is your balance?)

2. Is your bank account number a function of your balance?

    (if you input a balance does it make sense that the output is your bank account number?)
                               Section 1.1 Functions and Function Notation              3

Function Notation

To simplify writing out expressions and equations involving functions, a simplified
notation is often used. We also use descriptive variables to help us remember the
meaning of the quantities in the problem.

Rather than write "height is a function of age", we could use the descriptive variable h to
represent height and we could use the descriptive variable a to represent age.

"height is a function of age"  if we name the function f we write
"h is f of a"                  or more simply
h = f(a)                       we could instead name the function h and write
h(a)                           which is read "h of a"

Remember we can use any variable to name the function; the notation h(a) shows us that
h depends on a. The value "a" must be put into the function "h" to get a result. Be
careful - the parentheses indicate that age is input into the function (Note: do not confuse
these parentheses with multiplication! It does not mean "h times a").

Function Notation

The notation output = f(input) defines a function named f. This would be read "output
is f of input"

Example 4
 Introduce function notation to represent a function that takes as input the name of a
 month, and gives as output the number of days in that month.

 The number of days in a month is a function of the name of the month, so if we name
 the function f, we could write "days = f(month)" or d = f(m). If we simply name the
 function d, we could write d(m)

 For example, d(March) = 31, since March has 31 days. The notation d(m) reminds us
 that the number of days, d (the output) is dependent on the name of the month, m (the
 input)

Example 5
 A function N = f(y) gives the number of police officers, N, in a town in year y. What
 does f(2005) = 300 tell us?

 When we read f(2005) = 300, we see the input quantity is 2005, which is a value for the
 input quantity of the function, the year (y). The output value is 300, the number of
 police officers (N), a value for the output quantity. Remember N=f(y). This tells us that
 in the year 2005 there were 300 police officers in the town.
4 Chapter 1

Tables as Functions

Functions can be represented in many ways: Words (as we did in the last few examples),
tables of values, graphs, or formulas. Represented as a table, we are presented with a list
of input and output values.
In some cases, these values represent everything we know about the relationship, while in
other cases the table is simply providing us a few select values from a more complete
relationship.

Table 1: This table represents the input, number of the month (January = 1, February = 2,
and so on) while the output is the number of days in that month. This represents
everything we know about the months & days for a given year (that is not a leap year)

(input) Month           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
number, m               31 28 31 30 31 30 31 31 30 31 30 31

(output) Days
in month, D

Table 2: The table below defines a function Q = g(n). Remember this notation tells us g
is the name of the function that takes the input n and gives the output Q.

n 1                  2         3  4       5

Q 8                  6         7  6       8

Table 3: This table represents the age of children in years and their corresponding
heights. This represents just some of the data available for height and ages of children.

 Which of these tables define a function (if any)? Are any of them one-to-one?

The first and second tables define functions. In both, each input corresponds to exactly
one output. The third table does not define a function since the input value of 5
corresponds with two different output values.

Only the first table is one-to-one; it is both a function, and each output corresponds to
exactly one input. Although table 2 is a function, because each input corresponds to
exactly one output, each output does not correspond to exactly one input so this
function is not one-to-one. Table 3 is not even a function and so we don't even need to
consider if it is a one-to-one function.

Solving and Evaluating Functions:

When we work with functions, there are two typical things we do: evaluate and
solve. Evaluating a function is what we do when we know an input, and use the function
to determine the corresponding output. Evaluating will always produce one result, since
each input of a function corresponds to exactly one output.

Solving equations involving a function is what we do when we know an output, and use
the function to determine the inputs that would produce that output. Solving a function
could produce more than one solution, since different inputs can produce the same
output.

Example 7
 Using the table shown, where Q=g(n)

a) Evaluate g(3)                      n 1  2                   3  4  5

                                      Q 8  6                   7  6  8

Evaluating g(3) (read: "g of 3")
means that we need to determine the output value, Q, of the function g given the input
value of n=3. Looking at the table, we see the output corresponding to n=3 is Q=7,
allowing us to conclude g(3) = 7.

b) Solve g(n) = 6

Solving g(n) = 6 means we need to determine what input values, n, produce an output
value of 6. Looking at the table we see there are two solutions: n = 2 and n = 4.

When we input 2 into the function g, our output is Q = 6

When we input 4 into the function g, our output is also Q = 6

Graphs as Functions
Oftentimes a graph of a relationship can be used to define a
function. By convention, graphs are typically created with the
input quantity along the horizontal axis and the output quantity
along the vertical.
The most common graph has y on the vertical axis and x on the
horizontal axis, and we say y is a function of x, or y = f(x) when
the function is named f.

Example 8
 Which of these graphs defines a function y=f(x)? Which of these graphs defines a one-
 to-one function?

 Looking at the three graphs above, the first two define a function y=f(x), since for each
 input value along the horizontal axis there is exactly one output value corresponding,
 determined by the y-value of the graph. The 3rd graph does not define a function y=f(x)
 since some input values, such as x=2, correspond with more than one output value.
 Graph 1 is not a one-to-one function. For example, the output value 3 has two
 corresponding input values, -1 and 2.3
 Graph 2 is a one-to-one function; each input corresponds to exactly one output, and
 every output corresponds to exactly one input.
 Graph 3 is not even a function so there is no reason to even check to see if it is a one-to-
 one function.

Vertical Line Test

The vertical line test is a handy way to think about whether a graph defines the
vertical output as a function of the horizontal input. Imagine drawing vertical lines
through the graph. If any vertical line would cross the graph more than once, then the
graph does not define only one vertical output for each horizontal input.

 Horizontal Line Test
 Once you have determined that a graph defines a function, an easy way to determine if
 it is a one-to-one function is to use the horizontal line test. Draw horizontal lines
 through the graph. If any horizontal line crosses the graph more than once, then the
 graph does not define a one-to-one function.

Evaluating a function using a graph requires taking the given input and using the graph to
look up the corresponding output. Solving a function equation using a graph requires
taking the given output and looking on the graph to determine the corresponding input.

Example 9
 Given the graph of f(x)
 a) Evaluate f(2)
 b) Solve f(x) = 4

 a) To evaluate f(2), we find the input of x=2 on the
 horizontal axis. Moving up to the graph gives the
 point (2, 1), giving an output of y=1. f(2) = 1.

 b) To solve f(x) = 4, we find the value 4 on the
 vertical axis because if f(x) = 4 then 4 is the
 output. Moving horizontally across the graph gives
 two points with the output of 4: (-1,4) and
 (3,4). These give the two solutions to f(x) = 4: x =
 -1 or x = 3
 This means f(-1)=4 and f(3)=4, or when the input is -1 or 3, the output is 4.

Notice that while the graph in the previous example is a function, getting two input
values for the output value of 4 shows us that this function is not one-to-one.

5. Using the graph from example 9, solve f(x)=1.
8 Chapter 1

Formulas as Functions

When possible, it is very convenient to define relationships using formulas. If it is
possible to express the output as a formula involving the input quantity, then we can
define a function.

Example 10
 Express the relationship 2n + 6p = 12 as a function p = f(n) if possible.

To express the relationship in this form, we need to be able to write the relationship
where p is a function of n, which means writing it as p = [something involving n].

2n + 6p = 12  subtract 2n from both sides
6p = 12 - 2n  divide both sides by 6 and simplify

p = 12 - 2n = 12 - 2n = 2 - 1 n
6             66  3

Having rewritten the formula as p=, we can now express p as a function:
p = f (n) = 2 - 1 n

                  3

It is important to note that not every relationship can be expressed as a function with a
formula.

Note the important feature of an equation written as a function is that the output value can
be determined directly from the input by doing evaluations - no further solving is
required. This allows the relationship to act as a magic box that takes an input, processes
it, and returns an output. Modern technology and computers rely on these functional
relationships, since the evaluation of the function can be programmed into machines,
whereas solving things is much more challenging.

Example 11
 Express the relationship x2 + y2 = 1 as a function y = f(x) if possible.

 If we try to solve for y in this equation:
  y2 =1- x2
  y =  1- x2

 We end up with two outputs corresponding to the same input, so this relationship cannot
 be represented as a single function y = f(x).
                                   Section 1.1 Functions and Function Notation             9

As with tables and graphs, it is common to evaluate and solve functions involving
formulas. Evaluating will require replacing the input variable in the formula with the
value provided and calculating. Solving will require replacing the output variable in the
formula with the value provided, and solving for the input(s) that would produce that
output.

Example 12
 Given the function k(t) = t3 + 2

 a) Evaluate k(2)
 b) Solve k(t) = 1

a) "Evaluate k(2)" means we want to find the output when the input is t = 2. We plug in
the input value 2 into the formula wherever we see the input variable t, then simplify
k(2) = 23 + 2

k(2) = 8 + 2

So k(2) = 10

b) "Solve k(t) = 1" means we want to find the input t that will give us an output of 1.

We set the formula for k(t) equal to 1, and solve for the input

k(t) = 1   substitute the original formula k(t) = t3 + 2

t3 + 2 =1  subtract 2 from each side

t3 = -1    take the cube root of each side

t = -1

When solving an equation using formulas, you can check your answer by using your
solution in the original equation to see if your calculated answer is correct.

We want to know if k(t) = 1 is true when t = -1.
k(-1) = (-1)3 + 2

       = -1+ 2
       = 1 which was the desired result.

Example 13
 Given the function h( p) = p2 + 2 p
 a) Evaluate h(4)
 b) Solve h(p) = 3

 To evaluate h(4) we substitute the value 4 for the input variable p in the given function.
 a) h(4) = (4)2 + 2(4)

          = 16 + 8
          = 24
10 Chapter 1

b) h(p) = 3          Substitute the original function h( p) = p2 + 2 p

p2 + 2p = 3          This is quadratic, so we can rearrange the equation to get it = 0

p2 + 2 p - 3 = 0 subtract 3 from each side

p2 + 2 p - 3 = 0 this is factorable, so we factor it

( p + 3)( p -1) = 0

By the zero factor theorem since ( p + 3)( p -1) = 0 , either ( p + 3) = 0 or ( p -1) = 0 (or

both of them equal 0) and so we solve both equations for p, finding p = -3 from the first
equation and p = 1 from the second equation.

This gives us the solution: h(p) = 3 when p = 1 or p = -3

We found two solutions in this case, which tells us this function is not one-to-one.

Basic Toolkit Functions

In this text, we will be exploring functions - the shapes of their graphs, their unique
features, their equations, and how to solve problems with them. When learning to read,
we start with the alphabet. When learning to do arithmetic, we start with numbers.
When working with functions, it is similarly helpful to have a base set of elements to
build from. We call these our "toolkit of functions" - a set of basic named functions for
which we know the graph, equation, and special features.

For these definitions we will use x as the input variable and f(x) as the output variable.

You will see these toolkit functions, combinations of toolkit functions, their graphs and
their transformations frequently throughout this book. In order to successfully follow
along later in the book, it will be very helpful if you can recognize these toolkit functions
and their features quickly by name, equation, graph and basic table values.

Not every important equation can be written as y = f(x). An example of this is the
equation of a circle. Recall the distance formula for the distance between two points:

dist = (x2 - x1 )2 + (y2 - y1 )2

A circle with radius r with center at (h, k) can be described as all points (x, y) a distance

of r from the center, so using the distance formula, r = (x - h)2 + (y - k )2 , giving

Equation of a circle

A circle with radius r with center (h, k) has equation r 2 = (x - h)2 + (y - k )2

    originally left Padelford Hall.

c. Dave leaves Padelford Hall and walks at a constant speed. It takes him 6 minutes

    speed he had when he originally left Padelford Hall.

Section 1.2 Domain and Range

One of our main goals in mathematics is to model the real world with mathematical
functions. In doing so, it is important to keep in mind the limitations of those models we
create.

This table shows a relationship between circumference and height of a tree as it grows.

Circumference, c 1.7 2.5  5.5 8.2 13.7
                          45.2 54.6 92.1
Height, h     24.5 31

While there is a strong relationship between the two, it would certainly be ridiculous to
talk about a tree with a circumference of -3 feet, or a height of 3000 feet. When we
identify limitations on the inputs and outputs of a function, we are determining the
domain and range of the function.

Domain and Range
Domain: The set of possible input values to a function
Range: The set of possible output values of a function

Example 1
 Using the tree table above, determine a reasonable domain and range.

 We could combine the data provided with our own experiences and reason to
 approximate the domain and range of the function h = f(c). For the domain, possible
 values for the input circumference c, it doesn't make sense to have negative values, so c
 > 0. We could make an educated guess at a maximum reasonable value, or look up that
 the maximum circumference measured is about 119 feet1. With this information, we
 would say a reasonable domain is 0  c 119 feet.

 Similarly for the range, it doesn't make sense to have negative heights, and the
 maximum height of a tree could be looked up to be 379 feet, so a reasonable range is
  0  h  379 feet.

Example 2

 When sending a letter through the United States Postal Service, the price depends upon
 the weight of the letter2, as shown in the table below. Determine the domain and range.

             Letters  Price
Weight not Over       $0.58
1 ounce               $0.78
2 ounces              $0.98
3 ounces              $1.18
3.5 ounces

Suppose we notate Weight by w and Price by p, and set up a function named P, where
Price, p is a function of Weight, w. p = P(w).

Since acceptable weights are 3.5 ounces or less, and negative weights don't make sense,
the domain would be 0  w  3.5 . Technically 0 could be included in the domain, but
logically it would mean we are mailing nothing, so it doesn't hurt to leave it out.

Since possible prices are from a limited set of values, we can only define the range of
this function by listing the possible values. The range is p = $0.58, $0.78, $0.98, or
$1.18.

Try it Now
1. The population of a small town in the year 1960 was 100 people. Since then the

    population has grown to 1400 people reported during the 2010 census. Choose
    descriptive variables for your input and output and use interval notation to write the
    domain and range.

Notation

In the previous examples, we used inequalities to describe the domain and range of the
functions. This is one way to describe intervals of input and output values, but is not the
only way. Let us take a moment to discuss notation for domain and range.

Using inequalities, such as 0  c 163 , 0  w  3.5 , and 0  h  379 imply that we are
interested in all values between the low and high values, including the high values in
these examples.

However, occasionally we are interested in a specific list of numbers like the range for
the price to send letters, p = $0.58, $0.78, $0.98, or $1.18. These numbers represent a set
of specific values: {0.58, 0.78, 0.98, 1.18}

24 Chapter 1

Representing values as a set, or giving instructions on how a set is built, leads us to
another type of notation to describe the domain and range.

Suppose we want to describe the values for a variable x that are 10 or greater, but less
than 30. In inequalities, we would write 10  x  30 .

When describing domains and ranges, we sometimes extend this into set-builder

notation, which would look like this: x |10  x  30 . The curly brackets {} are read as

"the set of", and the vertical bar | is read as "such that", so altogether we would read

x |10  x  30 as "the set of x-values such that 10 is less than or equal to x and x is less

than 30."

When describing ranges in set-builder notation, we could similarly write something like

 f (x) | 0  f (x)  100 , or if the output had its own variable, we could use it. So for our
tree height example above, we could write for the range h | 0  h  379 . In set-builder
notation, if a domain or range is not limited, we could write t | t is a real number , or
t | t   , read as "the set of t-values such that t is an element of the set of real numbers.

A more compact alternative to set-builder notation is interval notation, in which
intervals of values are referred to by the starting and ending values. Curved parentheses
are used for "strictly less than," and square brackets are used for "less than or equal to."
Since infinity is not a number, we can't include it in the interval, so we always use curved
parentheses with  and -. The table below will help you see how inequalities
correspond to set-builder notation and interval notation:

Inequality        Set Builder Notation  Interval notation
5  h 10                                 (5, 10]
5  h 10           h | 5  h  10          [5, 10)
5  h 10           h | 5  h  10          (5, 10)
                  h | 5  h  10          (-,10)
h 10              h | h  10             [10, )
h 10              h | h  10             (-, )
                  h | h  
all real numbers

To combine two intervals together, using inequalities or set-builder notation we can use
the word "or". In interval notation, we use the union symbol,  , to combine two
unconnected intervals together.

Example 3
 Describe the intervals of values shown on the line graph below using set builder and
 interval notations.

 To describe the values, x, that lie in the intervals shown above we would say, "x is a real
 number greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3, or a real number greater
 than 5."
 As an inequality it is: 1  x  3 or x  5

 In set builder notation: x |1  x  3 or x  5

 In interval notation: [1,3]  (5, )

Remember when writing or reading interval notation:
Using a square bracket [ means the start value is included in the set
Using a parenthesis ( means the start value is not included in the set

   interval notation.

Domain and Range from Graphs
We can also talk about domain and range based on graphs. Since domain refers to the set
of possible input values, the domain of a graph consists of all the input values shown on
the graph. Remember that input values are almost always shown along the horizontal
axis of the graph. Likewise, since range is the set of possible output values, the range of
a graph we can see from the possible values along the vertical axis of the graph.
Be careful - if the graph continues beyond the window on which we can see the graph,
the domain and range might be larger than the values we can see.
26 Chapter 1
Example 4

 Determine the domain and range of the graph below.

 In the graph above3, the input quantity along the horizontal axis appears to be "year",
 which we could notate with the variable y. The output is "thousands of barrels of oil per
 day", which we might notate with the variable b, for barrels. The graph would likely
 continue to the left and right beyond what is shown, but based on the portion of the
 graph that is shown to us, we can determine the domain is 1975  y  2008 , and the
 range is approximately180  b  2010 .
 In interval notation, the domain would be [1975, 2008] and the range would be about
 [180, 2010]. For the range, we have to approximate the smallest and largest outputs
 since they don't fall exactly on the grid lines.
Remember that, as in the previous example, x and y are not always the input and output
variables. Using descriptive variables is an important tool to remembering the context of
the problem.

Domains and Ranges of the Toolkit functions
We will now return to our set of toolkit functions to note the domain and range of each.
Constant Function: f (x) = c
The domain here is not restricted; x can be anything. When this is the case we say the
domain is all real numbers. The outputs are limited to the constant value of the function.
Domain: (-, )
Range: [c]
Since there is only one output value, we list it by itself in square brackets.
Identity Function: f (x) = x
Domain: (-, )
Range: (-, )
Quadratic Function: f (x) = x2
Domain: (-, )
Range: [0, )
Multiplying a negative or positive number by itself can only yield a positive output.
Cubic Function: f (x) = x3
Domain: (-, )
Range: (-, )
28 Chapter 1

Reciprocal: f (x) = 1
                         x

Domain: (-, 0)  (0, )
Range: (-, 0)  (0, )
We cannot divide by 0 so we must exclude 0 from the domain.
One divide by any value can never be 0, so the range will not include 0.

                                   1
Reciprocal squared: f (x) = 2

                                   x
Domain: (-, 0)  (0, )
Range: (0, )
We cannot divide by 0 so we must exclude 0 from the domain.

Cube Root: f (x) = 3 x
Domain: (-, )
Range: (-, )

Square Root: f (x) = 2 x , commonly just written as, f (x) = x
Domain: [0, )
Range: [0, )
When dealing with the set of real numbers we cannot take the square root of a negative
number so the domain is limited to 0 or greater.

Absolute Value Function: f (x) = x
Domain: (-, )
Range: [0, )
Since absolute value is defined as a distance from 0, the output can only be greater than
or equal to 0.

Example 5                                              b) g(x) = 3
 Find the domain of each function: a) f (x) = 2 x + 4               6 - 3x

a) Since we cannot take the square root of a negative number, we need the inside of the
square root to be non-negative.
x + 4  0 when x  -4 .
The domain of f(x) is [-4, ) .

b) We cannot divide by zero, so we need the denominator to be non-zero.
6 - 3x = 0 when x = 2, so we must exclude 2 from the domain.
The domain of g(x) is (-,2)  (2, ) .
                                                              Section 1.2 Domain and Range 29

Piecewise Functions

In the toolkit functions we introduced the absolute value function f (x) = x .
With a domain of all real numbers and a range of values greater than or equal to 0, the
absolute value can be defined as the magnitude or modulus of a number, a real number
value regardless of sign, the size of the number, or the distance from 0 on the number
line. All of these definitions require the output to be greater than or equal to 0.

If we input 0, or a positive value the output is unchanged
f (x) = x if x  0

If we input a negative value the sign must change from negative to positive.
f (x) = -x if x  0 , since multiplying a negative value by -1 makes it positive.

Since this requires two different processes or pieces, the absolute value function is often
called the most basic piecewise defined function.

Piecewise Function

A piecewise function is a function in which the formula used depends upon the
domain the input lies in. We notate this idea like:

        formula 1 if  domain to use formula 1
                      domain to use formula 2
f (x) = formula 2 if  domain to use formula 3
        formula 3 if

Example 6
 A museum charges $5 per person for a guided tour with a group of 1 to 9 people, or a

 of people, n, to the cost, C.

 To set up this function, two different formulas would be needed. C = 5n would work
 for n values under 10, and C = 50 would work for values of n ten or greater. Notating
 this:

          5n if 0  n  10
  C(n) =

A prepaid cell phone company uses the function below to determine the cost, C, in

dollars for g gigabytes of data transfer.

C(g) =              g2
25 +10(g - 2) if

Find the cost of using 1.5 gigabytes of data, and the cost of using 4 gigabytes of data.

To find the cost of using 1.5 gigabytes of data, C(1.5), we first look to see which piece
of domain our input falls in. Since 1.5 is less than 2, we use the first formula, giving
C(1.5) = $25.

The find the cost of using 4 gigabytes of data, C(4), we see that our input of 4 is greater
than 2, so we'll use the second formula. C(4) = 25 + 10(4-2) = $45.

The first two component functions are from our library of Toolkit functions, so we
know their shapes. We can imagine graphing each function, then limiting the graph to
the indicated domain. At the endpoints of the domain, we put open circles to indicate
where the endpoint is not included, due to a strictly-less-than inequality, and a closed
circle where the endpoint is included, due to a less-than-or-equal-to inequality.

                                   .
For the third function, you should recognize this as a linear equation from your previous
coursework. If you remember how to graph a line using slope and intercept, you can do
that. Otherwise, we could calculate a couple values, plot points, and connect them with
a line.

At x = 2, f(2) = 6 - 2 = 4. We place an open circle here.
At x = 3, f(3) = 6 - 3 = 3. Connect these points with a line.

Now that we have each piece individually, we combine them onto the same graph:

Section 1.3 Rates of Change and Behavior of Graphs

Since functions represent how an output quantity varies with an input quantity, it is
natural to ask about the rate at which the values of the function are changing.

For example, the function C(t) below gives the average cost, in dollars, of a gallon of
gasoline t years after 2000.

t  2          3  4  5  6  7  8                      9

C(t) 1.47 1.69 1.94 2.30 2.51 2.64 3.01 2.14

If we were interested in how the gas prices had changed between 2002 and 2009, we
could compute that the cost per gallon had increased from $1.47 to $2.14, an increase of
$0.67. While this is interesting, it might be more useful to look at how much the price
changed per year. You are probably noticing that the price didn't change the same
amount each year, so we would be finding the average rate of change over a specified
amount of time.

The gas price increased by $0.67 from 2002 to 2009, over 7 years, for an average of
 $0.67  0.096 dollars per year. On average, the price of gas increased by about 9.6
7 years
cents each year.

Rate of Change

A rate of change describes how the output quantity changes in relation to the input
quantity. The units on a rate of change are "output units per input units"

Some other examples of rates of change would be quantities like:
     A population of rats increases by 40 rats per week
     A barista earns $9 per hour (dollars per hour)
     A farmer plants 60,000 onions per acre
     A car can drive 27 miles per gallon
     A population of grey whales decreases by 8 whales per year
     The amount of money in your college account decreases by $4,000 per quarter
                                   Section 1.3 Rates of Change and Behavior of Graphs 37

 Average Rate of Change
 The average rate of change between two input values is the total change of the
 function values (output values) divided by the change in the input values.
 Average rate of change = Change of Output = y = y2 - y1

                                  Change of Input x x2 - x1

Example 1
 Using the cost-of-gas function from earlier, find the average rate of change between
 2007 and 2009

 From the table, in 2007 the cost of gas was $2.64. In 2009 the cost was $2.14.

 The input (years) has changed by 2. The output has changed by $2.14 - $2.64 = -0.50.
 The average rate of change is then - $0.50 = -0.25 dollars per year

                                            2 years

1. Using the same cost-of-gas function, find the average rate of change between 2003 and

   2008

Notice that in the last example the change of output was negative since the output value
of the function had decreased. Correspondingly, the average rate of change is negative.

Example 2
 Given the function g(t) shown here, find the average rate of change on the interval
 [0, 3].

 At t = 0, the graph shows g(0) = 1
 At t = 3, the graph shows g(3) = 4

 The output has changed by 3 while the input has changed by
 3, giving an average rate of change of:
  4-1 = 3 =1
  3-0 3

 record your distance from home over time. Find your average speed over the first 6

D(t) (miles) 10             55       90      153 214 240 292 300

Here, your average speed is the average rate of change.
You traveled 282 miles in 6 hours, for an average speed of
292 -10 = 282 = 47 miles per hour

We can more formally state the average rate of change calculation using function
notation.

Average Rate of Change using Function Notation

Given a function f(x), the average rate of change on the interval [a, b] is

Average rate of change = Change of Output = f (b) - f (a)
                            Change of Input     b-a

We can start by computing the function values at each endpoint of the interval

f (2) = 22 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 7

f (4) = 42 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 63

Graphical Behavior of Functions

As part of exploring how functions change, it is interesting to explore the graphical
behavior of functions.

 Increasing/Decreasing
 A function is increasing on an interval if the function values increase as the inputs
 increase. More formally, a function is increasing if f(b) > f(a) for any two input values
 a and b in the interval with b>a. The average rate of change of an increasing function
 is positive.

 A function is decreasing on an interval if the function values decrease as the inputs
 increase. More formally, a function is decreasing if f(b) < f(a) for any two input
 values a and b in the interval with b>a. The average rate of change of a decreasing
 function is negative.

Example 7
 Given the function p(t) graphed here, on what intervals
 does the function appear to be increasing?

 The function appears to be increasing from t = 1 to t = 3,
 and from t = 4 on.

 In interval notation, we would say the function appears to
 be increasing on the interval (1, 3) and the interval (4, ) .

Notice in the last example that we used open intervals (intervals that don't include the
endpoints) since the function is neither increasing nor decreasing at t = 1, 3, or 4.
         Section 1.3 Rates of Change and Behavior of Graphs 41

Local Extrema
A point where a function changes from increasing to decreasing is called a local
maximum.

A point where a function changes from decreasing to increasing is called a local
minimum.

Together, local maxima and minima are called the local extrema, or local extreme
values, of the function.

Example 8
 Using the cost of gasoline function from the beginning of the section, find an interval on
 which the function appears to be decreasing. Estimate any local extrema using the
 table.

t  2  3  4  5  6  7  8                                                              9

C(t) 1.47 1.69 1.94 2.30 2.51 2.64 3.01 2.14

It appears that the cost of gas increased from t = 2 to t = 8. It appears the cost of gas
decreased from t = 8 to t = 9, so the function appears to be decreasing on the interval
(8, 9).

Since the function appears to change from increasing to decreasing at t = 8, there is
local maximum at t = 8.

Example 9                                                                           Use these to

 Use a graph to estimate the local extrema of the function f (x) = 2 + x .
                                                                                x3

 determine the intervals on which the function is increasing.

Using technology to graph the function, it appears there is a local minimum somewhere
between x = 2 and x =3, and a symmetric local maximum somewhere between x = -3
and x = -2.

Most graphing calculators and graphing utilities can estimate the location of maxima
and minima. Below are screen images from two different technologies, showing the
estimate for the local maximum and minimum.
42 Chapter 1

 Based on these estimates, the function is increasing on the intervals (-,-2.449) and
  (2.449, ) . Notice that while we expect the extrema to be symmetric, the two different
 technologies agree only up to 4 decimals due to the differing approximation algorithms
 used by each.

As you can see, the sales for each company are increasing, but they are increasing in very
different ways. To describe the difference in behavior, we can investigate how the
average rate of change varies over different intervals. Using tables of values,

Company A    Rate of  Company B    Rate of

From the tables, we can see that the rate of change for company A is decreasing, while
the rate of change for company B is increasing.

When the rate of change is getting smaller, as with Company A, we say the function is
concave down. When the rate of change is getting larger, as with Company B, we say
the function is concave up.

 Concavity
 A function is concave up if the rate of change is increasing.
 A function is concave down if the rate of change is decreasing.
 A point where a function changes from concave up to concave down or vice versa is
 called an inflection point.

Example 10
 An object is thrown from the top of a building. The object's height in feet above
 ground after t seconds is given by the function h(t) = 144 -16t 2 for 0  t  3 . Describe

 the concavity of the graph.

Sketching a graph of the function, we can see that the function
is decreasing. We can calculate some rates of change to
explore the behavior.

   t             h(t)     Rate of

                          Change

   0             144

                          -16

   1             128

                          -48

   2             80

                          -80

   3             0

Notice that the rates of change are becoming more negative, so the rates of change are
decreasing. This means the function is concave down.

Example 11
 The value, V, of a car after t years is given in the table below. Is the value increasing or
 decreasing? Is the function concave up or concave down?

t             0        2       4       6         8

   V(t) 28000 24342 21162 18397 15994
Since the values are getting smaller, we can determine that the value is decreasing. We

can compute rates of change to determine concavity.

t                      0           2          4                  6            8
V(t)                                                                          15994
Rate of change         28000       24342      21162              18397  -1201.5

                               -1829      -1590          -1382.5

Since these values are becoming less negative, the rates of change are increasing, so
this function is concave up.

Example 12
 Estimate from the graph shown the intervals
 on which the function is concave down and
 concave up.

 On the far left, the graph is decreasing but
 concave up, since it is bending upwards. It
 begins increasing at x = -2, but it continues to
 bend upwards until about x = -1.

 From x = -1 the graph starts to bend
 downward, and continues to do so until about
 x = 2. The graph then begins curving upwards
 for the remainder of the graph shown.

 From this, we can estimate that the graph is concave up on the intervals (-,-1) and
  (2, ) , and is concave down on the interval (-1,2) . The graph has inflection points at
 x = -1 and x = 2.

Section 1.4 Composition of Functions

Suppose we wanted to calculate how much it costs to heat a house on a particular day of
the year. The cost to heat a house will depend on the average daily temperature, and the
average daily temperature depends on the particular day of the year. Notice how we have
just defined two relationships: The temperature depends on the day, and the cost depends
on the temperature. Using descriptive variables, we can notate these two functions.

The first function, C(T), gives the cost C of heating a house when the average daily
temperature is T degrees Celsius, and the second, T(d), gives the average daily
temperature on day d of the year in some city. If we wanted to determine the cost of
heating the house on the 5th day of the year, we could do this by linking our two functions
together, an idea called composition of functions. Using the function T(d), we could
evaluate T(5) to determine the average daily temperature on the 5th day of the year. We
could then use that temperature as the input to the C(T) function to find the cost to heat
the house on the 5th day of the year: C(T(5)).

 Composition of Functions
 When the output of one function is used as the input of another, we call the entire
 operation a composition of functions. We write f(g(x)), and read this as "f of g of x"
 or "f composed with g at x".

 An alternate notation for composition uses the composition operator: 
  ( f  g)(x) is read "f of g of x" or "f composed with g at x", just like f(g(x)).

Example 1
 Suppose c(s) gives the number of calories burned doing s sit-ups, and s(t) gives the
 number of sit-ups a person can do in t minutes. Interpret c(s(3)).

 When we are asked to interpret, we are being asked to explain the meaning of the
 expression in words. The inside expression in the composition is s(3). Since the input
 to the s function is time, the 3 is representing 3 minutes, and s(3) is the number of sit-
 ups that can be done in 3 minutes. Taking this output and using it as the input to the
 c(s) function will gives us the calories that can be burned by the number of sit-ups that
 can be done in 3 minutes.

Note that it is not important that the same variable be used for the output of the inside
function and the input to the outside function. However, it is essential that the units on
the output of the inside function match the units on the input to the outside function, if the
units are specified.
52 Chapter 1

Example 2
 Suppose f(x) gives miles that can be driven in x hours, and g(y) gives the gallons of gas
 used in driving y miles. Which of these expressions is meaningful: f(g(y)) or g(f(x))?

 The expression g(y) takes miles as the input and outputs a number of gallons. The
 function f(x) is expecting a number of hours as the input; trying to give it a number of
 gallons as input does not make sense. Remember the units must match, and number of
 gallons does not match number of hours, so the expression f(g(y)) is meaningless.

 The expression f(x) takes hours as input and outputs a number of miles driven. The
 function g(y) is expecting a number of miles as the input, so giving the output of the f(x)
 function (miles driven) as an input value for g(y), where gallons of gas depends on
 miles driven, does make sense. The expression g(f(x)) makes sense, and will give the
 number of gallons of gas used, g, driving a certain number of miles, f(x), in x hours.

   cost C depends on the clearance price, p, according to the function C(p). Clearance
   price, p, depends on the original discount, d, given to the clearance item, p(d).
   Interpret C(p(d)).

Composition of Functions using Tables and Graphs

When working with functions given as tables and graphs, we can look up values for the
functions using a provided table or graph, as discussed in section 1.1. We start evaluation
from the provided input, and first evaluate the inside function. We can then use the
output of the inside function as the input to the outside function. To remember this,
always work from the inside out.

Example 3
 Using the tables below, evaluate f (g(3)) and g( f (4))

x  f(x)  x  g(x)

1  6     1  3

2  8     2  5

3  3     3  2

4  1     4  7

To evaluate f (g(3)) , we start from the inside with the value 3. We then evaluate the
inside expression g(3) using the table that defines the function g: g(3) = 2 .
                                                     Section 1.4 Composition of Functions 53
 We can then use that result as the input to the f function, so g(3) is replaced by the
 equivalent value 2 and we can evaluate f (2) . Then using the table that defines the
 function f, we find that f (2) = 8 .
  f (g(3)) = f (2) = 8 .
 To evaluate g( f (4)) , we first evaluate the inside expression f (4) using the first table:
  f (4) = 1. Then using the table for g we can evaluate:
  g( f (4)) = g(1) = 3 .

Try it Now
2. Using the tables from the example above, evaluate f (g(1)) and g( f (3)) .

Example 4
 Using the graphs below, evaluate f (g(1)) .

 To evaluate f (g(1)) , we again start with the inside evaluation. We evaluate g(1) using
 the graph of the g(x) function, finding the input of 1 on the horizontal axis and finding
 the output value of the graph at that input. Here, g(1) = 3 .
 Using this value as the input to the f function, f (g(1)) = f (3) . We can then evaluate
 this by looking to the graph of the f(x) function, finding the input of 3 on the horizontal
 axis, and reading the output value of the graph at this input.
  f (3) = 6 , so f (g(1)) = 6 .

Try it Now
3. Using the graphs from the previous example, evaluate g( f (2)) .
54 Chapter 1

Composition using Formulas

When evaluating a composition of functions where we have either created or been given
formulas, the concept of working from the inside out remains the same. First, we
evaluate the inside function using the input value provided, then use the resulting output
as the input to the outside function.

Example 5
 Given f (t) = t 2 - t and h(x) = 3x + 2 , evaluate f (h(1)) .

 Since the inside evaluation is h(1) we start by evaluating the h(x) function at 1:
  h(1) = 3(1) + 2 = 5

 Then f (h(1)) = f (5) , so we evaluate the f(t) function at an input of 5:
  f (h(1)) = f (5) = 52 - 5 = 20

Try it Now
4. Using the functions from the example above, evaluate h( f (-2)) .

While we can compose the functions as above for each individual input value, sometimes
it would be really helpful to find a single formula which will calculate the result of a
composition f(g(x)). To do this, we will extend our idea of function evaluation. Recall
that when we evaluate a function like f (t) = t 2 - t , we put whatever value is inside the
parentheses after the function name into the formula wherever we see the input variable.

Example 6
 Given f (t) = t 2 - t , evaluate f (3) and f (-2) .

  f (3) = 32 - 3
  f (-2) = (-2)2 - (-2)

 We could simplify the results above if we wanted to
  f (3) = 32 - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6
  f (-2) = (-2)2 - (-2) = 4 + 2 = 6
                                                     Section 1.4 Composition of Functions 55

We are not limited, however, to using a numerical value as the input to the function. We
can put anything into the function: a value, a different variable, or even an algebraic
expression, provided we use the input expression everywhere we see the input variable.

Example 7
 Using the function from the previous example, evaluate f(a).

 This means that the input value for t is some unknown quantity a. As before, we
 evaluate by replacing the input variable t with the input quantity, in this case a.
  f (a) = a2 - a

The same idea can then be applied to expressions more complicated than a single letter.

Example 8
 Using the same f(t) function from above, evaluate f (x + 2) .

Everywhere in the formula for f where there was a t, we would replace it with the input
(x + 2) . Since in the original formula the input t was squared in the first term, the entire
input x + 2 needs to be squared when we substitute, so we need to use grouping
parentheses. To avoid problems, it is advisable to always use parentheses around
inputs.

f (x + 2) = (x + 2)2 - (x + 2)

We could simplify this expression further to f (x + 2) = x2 + 3x + 2 if we wanted to:

f (x + 2) = (x + 2)(x + 2) - (x + 2)    Use the "FOIL" technique (first, outside, inside, last)

f (x + 2) = x2 + 2x + 2x + 4 - (x + 2)  distribute the negative sign

f (x + 2) = x2 + 2x + 2x + 4 - x - 2    combine like terms

f (x + 2) = x2 + 3x + 2

Example 9
 Using the same function, evaluate f (t 3 ) .

 Note that in this example, the same variable is used in the input expression and as the
 input variable of the function. This doesn't matter - we still replace the original input t
 in the formula with the new input expression, t3 .
  f (t 3 ) = (t 3 )2 - (t 3 ) = t 6 - t 3

This now allows us to find an expression for a composition of functions. If we want to
find a formula for f(g(x)), we can start by writing out the formula for g(x). We can then
evaluate the function f(x) at that expression, as in the examples above.

Example 10
 Let f (x) = x2 and g(x) = 1 - 2x , find f(g(x)) and g(f(x)).
                                   x

 To find f(g(x)), we start by evaluating the inside, writing out the formula for g(x).
  g(x) = 1 - 2x

           x
                                    1 

 We then use the expression  - 2x  as input for the function f.
                                    x 

                 1 
  f (g(x)) = f  - 2x 

                 x 

 We then evaluate the function f(x) using the formula for g(x) as the input.
                           1   1 2

 Since f (x) = x2 , f  - 2x =  - 2x 
                          x  x 
                                                                          1 2

 This gives us the formula for the composition: f (g(x)) =  - 2x .
                                                                         x 

 Likewise, to find g(f(x)), we evaluate the inside, writing out the formula for f(x)

 g( f (x)) = g(x2 )

 Now we evaluate the function g(x) using x2 as the input.
  g( f (x)) = 2 1 - 2x 2

Example 11
 A city manager determines that the tax revenue, R, in millions of dollars collected on a
 population of p thousand people is given by the formula R( p) = 0.03 p + p , and that
 the city's population, in thousands, is predicted to follow the formula
  p(t) = 60 + 2t + 0.3t 2 , where t is measured in years after 2010. Find a formula for the
 tax revenue as a function of the year.

 Since we want tax revenue as a function of the year, we want year to be our initial input,
 and revenue to be our final output. To find revenue, we will first have to predict the
 city population, and then use that result as the input to the tax function. So we need to
 find R(p(t)). Evaluating this,

 R( p(t)) = R(60 + 2t + 0.3t 2 ) = 0.03(60 + 2t + 0.3t 2 )+ 60 + 2t + 0.3t 2

 This composition gives us a single formula which can be used to predict the tax revenue
 during a given year, without needing to find the intermediary population value.

 For example, to predict the tax revenue in 2017, when t = 7 (because t is measured in
 years after 2010),

 R( p(7)) = 0.03(60 + 2(7) + 0.3(7)2 )+ 60 + 2(7) + 0.3(7)2  12.079 million dollars

Domain of Compositions

When we think about the domain of a composition h(x) = f (g(x)) , we must consider
both the domain of the inner function and the domain of the composition itself. While it
is tempting to only look at the resulting composite function, if the inner function were
undefined at a value of x, the composition would not be possible.

Example 12                      x - 2 . Find the domain of f ( g(x)) .
 Let f (x) = 21 and g(x) =
                x -1

Since we want to avoid the square root of negative numbers, the domain of g(x) is the
set of values where x - 2  0 . The domain is x  2 .

The composition is f ( g(x)) =  2 1 = 1 = 1 .
                                ( x - 2 ) -1 (x - 2) -1 x - 3

The composition is undefined when x = 3, so that value must also be excluded from the
domain. Notice that the composition doesn't involve a square root, but we still have to
consider the domain limitation from the inside function.
58 Chapter 1

 Combining the two restrictions, the domain is all values of x greater than or equal to 2,
 except x = 3.

 In inequalities, the domain is: 2  x  3 or x  3.

 In interval notation, the domain is: 2,3)  (3, ) .

Decomposing Functions

In some cases, it is desirable to decompose a function - to write it as a composition of
two simpler functions.

Example 13
 Write f (x) = 3 + 5 - x2 as the composition of two functions.

 We are looking for two functions, g and h, so f (x) = g(h(x)) . To do this, we look for a
 function inside a function in the formula for f(x). As one possibility, we might notice
 that 5 - x2 is the inside of the square root. We could then decompose the function as:
  h(x) = 5 - x2
  g(x) = 3+ x

 We can check our answer by recomposing the functions:

 g(h(x)) = g(5 - x2 )= 3+ 5 - x2

 Note that this is not the only solution to the problem. Another non-trivial
 decomposition would be h(x) = x2 and g(x) = 3 + 5 - x

Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions

Often when given a problem, we try to model the scenario using mathematics in the form
of words, tables, graphs and equations in order to explain or solve it. When building
models, it is often helpful to build off of existing formulas or models. Knowing the basic
graphs of your tool-kit functions can help you solve problems by being able to model
new behavior by adapting something you already know. Unfortunately, the models and
existing formulas we know are not always exactly the same as the ones presented in the
problems we face.
Fortunately, there are systematic ways to shift, stretch, compress, flip and combine
functions to help them become better models for the problems we are trying to solve. We
can transform what we already know into what we need, hence the name,
"Transformation of functions." When we have a story problem, formula, graph, or table,
we can then transform that function in a variety of ways to form new functions.
Shifts
Example 1

 To regulate temperature in a green building, air flow vents near the roof open and close
 throughout the day to allow warm air to escape. The graph below shows the open vents
 V (in square feet) throughout the day, t in hours after midnight. During the summer, the
 facilities staff decides to try to better regulate temperature by increasing the amount of
 open vents by 20 square feet throughout the day. Sketch a graph of this new function.

 We can sketch a graph of this new function
 by adding 20 to each of the output values of
 the original function. This will have the
 effect of shifting the graph up.
                                                Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions 65

Notice that in the second graph, for each input value, the output value has increased by
twenty, so if we call the new function S(t), we could write S(t) = V (t) + 20 .

Note that this notation tells us that for any value of t, S(t) can be found by evaluating the
V function at the same input, then adding twenty to the result.
This defines S as a transformation of the function V, in this case a vertical shift up 20
units.

Notice that with a vertical shift the input values stay the same and only the output
values change.

Vertical Shift
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as
g(x) = f (x) + k , where k is a constant

then g(x) is a vertical shift of the function f(x), where all the output values have been
increased by k.
If k is positive, then the graph will shift up
If k is negative, then the graph will shift down

Example 2
 A function f(x) is given as a table below. Create a table for the function g(x) = f (x) - 3

x 2               4           6  8

f(x) 1            3           7  11

The formula g(x) = f (x) - 3 tells us that we can find the output values of the g function

by subtracting 3 from the output values of the f function. For example,

f (2) = 1         is found from the given table

g(x) = f (x) - 3  is our given transformation

g(2) = f (2) - 3 = 1- 3 = -2

Subtracting 3 from each f(x) value, we can complete a table of values for g(x)

x 2               4           6  8

g(x) -2 0                     4  8

As with the earlier vertical shift, notice the input values stay the same and only the output
values change.
66 Chapter 1

Try it Now
1. The function h(t) = -4.9t2 + 30t gives the height h of a ball (in meters) thrown

   upwards from the ground after t seconds. Suppose the ball was instead thrown from
   the top of a 10 meter building. Relate this new height function b(t) to h(t), then find a
   formula for b(t).

The vertical shift is a change to the output, or outside, of the function. We will now look
at how changes to input, on the inside of the function, change its graph and meaning.

Example 3
 Returning to our building air flow example from the beginning of the section, suppose
 that in Fall, the facilities staff decides that the original venting plan starts too late, and
 they want to move the entire venting program to start two hours earlier. Sketch a graph
 of the new function.

V(t) = the original venting plan  F(t) = starting 2 hours sooner

In the new graph, which we can call F(t), at each time, the air flow is the same as the
original function V(t) was two hours later. For example, in the original function V, the
air flow starts to change at 8am, while for the function F(t) the air flow starts to change
at 6am. The comparable function values are V (8) = F (6) .

Notice also that the vents first opened to 220 sq. ft. at 10 a.m. under the original plan,
while under the new plan the vents reach 220 sq. ft. at 8 a.m., so V (10) = F (8) .

In both cases we see that since F(t) starts 2 hours sooner, the same output values are
reached when, F (t) = V (t + 2)

Note that V (t + 2) had the effect of shifting the graph to the left.
                                                  Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions 67

Horizontal changes or "inside changes" affect the domain of a function (the input) instead
of the range and often seem counterintuitive. The new function F(t) uses the same
outputs as V(t), but matches those outputs to inputs two hours earlier than those of V(t).
Said another way, we must add 2 hours to the input of V to find the corresponding output
for F: F (t) = V (t + 2) .

Horizontal Shift
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as
g(x) = f (x + k) , where k is a constant
then g(x) is a horizontal shift of the function f(x)
If k is positive, then the graph will shift left
If k is negative, then the graph will shift right

Example 4
 A function f(x) is given as a table below. Create a table for the function g(x) = f (x - 3)

x 2     4                     6  8

f(x) 1  3                     7  11

The formula g(x) = f (x - 3) tells us that the output values of g are the same as the

output value of f with an input value three smaller. For example, we know that f (2) = 1.

To get the same output from the g function, we will need an input value that is 3 larger:
We input a value that is three larger for g(x) because the function takes three away
before evaluating the function f.

g(5) = f (5 - 3) = f (2) = 1

x 5     7                     9  11

g(x) 1  3                     7  11

The result is that the function g(x) has been shifted to the right by 3. Notice the output
values for g(x) remain the same as the output values for f(x) in the chart, but the
corresponding input values, x, have shifted to the right by 3: 2 shifted to 5, 4 shifted to
7, 6 shifted to 9 and 8 shifted to 11.
68 Chapter 1

Example 5
 The graph shown is a transformation of the toolkit function
  f (x) = x2 . Relate this new function g(x) to f(x), and then
 find a formula for g(x).

 Notice that the graph looks almost identical in shape to the
  f (x) = x2 function, but the x values are shifted to the right
 two units. The vertex used to be at (0, 0) but now the
 vertex is at (2, 0) . The graph is the basic quadratic
 function shifted two to the right, so
  g(x) = f (x - 2)

 Notice how we must input the value x = 2, to get the output value y = 0; the x values
 must be two units larger, because of the shift to the right by 2 units.

 We can then use the definition of the f(x) function to write a formula for g(x) by
 evaluating f (x - 2) :
 Since f (x) = x2 and g(x) = f (x - 2)
  g(x) = f (x - 2) = (x - 2)2

 If you find yourself having trouble determining whether the shift is +2 or -2, it might
 help to consider a single point on the graph. For a quadratic, looking at the bottom-
 most point is convenient. In the original function, f (0) = 0 . In our shifted function,
  g(2) = 0 . To obtain the output value of 0 from the f function, we need to decide
 whether a +2 or -2 will work to satisfy g(2) = f (2 ? 2) = f (0) = 0 . For this to work, we
 will need to subtract 2 from our input values.

When thinking about horizontal and vertical shifts, it is good to keep in mind that vertical
shifts are affecting the output values of the function, while horizontal shifts are affecting
the input values of the function.

Example 6
 The function G(m) gives the number of gallons of gas required to drive m miles.
 Interpret G(m) +10 and G(m +10) .

  G(m) +10 is adding 10 to the output, gallons. This is 10 gallons of gas more than is
 required to drive m miles. So, this is the gas required to drive m miles, plus another 10
 gallons of gas.

  G(m +10) is adding 10 to the input, miles. This is the number of gallons of gas
 required to drive 10 miles more than m miles.

2. Given the function f (x) = x graph the original function f (x) and the transformation

    g(x) = f (x + 2) .
   a. Is this a horizontal or a vertical change?
   b. Which way is the graph shifted and by how many units?
   c. Graph f(x) and g(x) on the same axes.

Now that we have two transformations, we can combine them together.
Remember:
Vertical Shifts are outside changes that affect the output (vertical) axis values shifting the
transformed function up or down.
Horizontal Shifts are inside changes that affect the input (horizontal) axis values shifting
the transformed function left or right.

Example 7
 Given f (x) = x , sketch a graph of h(x) = f (x +1) - 3 .
 The function f is our toolkit absolute value function. We know that this graph has a V
 shape, with the point at the origin. The graph of h has transformed f in two ways:
  f (x +1) is a change on the inside of the function, giving a horizontal shift left by 1,
 then the subtraction by 3 in f (x +1) - 3 is a change to the outside of the function,
 giving a vertical shift down by 3. Transforming the graph gives

 We could also find a formula for this transformation by evaluating the expression for
 h(x):
  h(x) = f (x +1) - 3
  h(x) = x +1 - 3
70 Chapter 1

Example 8
 Write a formula for the graph shown, a transformation
 of the toolkit square root function.
 The graph of the toolkit function starts at the origin, so
 this graph has been shifted 1 to the right, and up 2. In
 function notation, we could write that as
  h(x) = f (x -1) + 2 . Using the formula for the square
 root function we can write
  h(x) = x -1 + 2
 Note that this transformation has changed the domain
 and range of the function. This new graph has domain
  [1, ) and range [2, ) .

Reflections
Another transformation that can be applied to a function is a reflection over the horizontal
or vertical axis.

Example 9
 Reflect the graph of s(t) = t both vertically and horizontally.
 Reflecting the graph vertically, each output value will be reflected over the horizontal t
 axis:

 Since each output value is the opposite of the original output value, we can write
  V (t) = -s(t)
 V (t) = - t
 Notice this is an outside change or vertical change that affects the output s(t) values so
 the negative sign belongs outside of the function.
                                                Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions 71

Reflecting horizontally, each input value will be reflected over the vertical axis.

Since each input value is the opposite of the original input
value, we can write
H (t) = s(-t)
H (t) = -t

Notice this is an inside change or horizontal change that
affects the input values so the negative sign is on the inside
of the function.

Note that these transformations can affect the domain and
range of the functions. While the original square root function has domain [0, ) and
range [0, ) , the vertical reflection gives the V(t) function the range (-, 0] , and the
horizontal reflection gives the H(t) function the domain (-, 0] .

Reflections
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as
g(x) = - f (x) ,
then g(x) is a vertical reflection of the function f(x), sometimes called a reflection
about the x-axis

If we define a new function g(x) as
g(x) = f (-x) ,
then g(x) is a horizontal reflection of the function f(x), sometimes called a reflection
about the y-axis

Example 10

A function f(x) is given as a table below.  Create a table for the function  g(x) = - f (x)

and h(x) = f (-x)

                   x 2     4                6  8

                   f(x) 1  3                7  11

For g(x), this is a vertical reflection, so the x values stay the same and each output value
will be the opposite of the original output value

For h(x), this is a horizontal reflection, and each input value will be the opposite of the
original input value and the h(x) values stay the same as the f(x) values:

                   x -2 -4 -6 -8

                   h(x) 1  3                7  11
72 Chapter 1

Example 11
 A common model for learning has an equation similar
 to k(t) = -2-t +1, where k is the percentage of mastery

 that can be achieved after t practice sessions. This is a
 transformation of the function f (t) = 2t shown here.

 Sketch a graph of k(t).

This equation combines three transformations into one
equation.

A horizontal reflection: f (-t) = 2-t           combined with

A vertical reflection:  - f (-t) = -2-t         combined with

A vertical shift up 1:  - f (-t) +1 = -2-t +1

We can sketch a graph by applying these transformations one at a time to the original

function:

The original graph      Horizontally reflected              Then vertically reflected

 Then, after shifting up 1, we get the final graph.
  k(t) = - f (-t) +1 = -2-t +1.
 Note: As a model for learning, this function would

 be limited to a domain of t  0 , with corresponding

 range [0,1) .

Try it Now
3. Given the toolkit function f (x) = x2 , graph g(x) = -f(x) and h(x) = f(-x).

    Do you notice anything surprising?
            Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions 73

Some functions exhibit symmetry, in which reflections result in the original graph. For
example, reflecting the toolkit functions f (x) = x2 or f (x) = x about the y-axis will

result in the original graph. We call these types of graphs symmetric about the y-axis.

Likewise, if the graphs of f (x) = x3 or f (x) = 1 were reflected over both axes, the
                                                           x

result would be the original graph:

f (x) = x3  f (-x)  - f (-x)

We call these graphs symmetric about the origin.

 Even and Odd Functions
 A function is called an even function if
   f (x) = f (-x)
 The graph of an even function is symmetric about the vertical axis

 A function is called an odd function if
   f (x) = - f (-x)
 The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin

Note: A function can be neither even nor odd if it does not exhibit either symmetry. For
example, the f (x) = 2x function is neither even nor odd.

Example 12
 Is the function f (x) = x3 + 2x even, odd, or neither?

 Without looking at a graph, we can determine this by finding formulas for the
 reflections, and seeing if they return us to the original function:
74 Chapter 1

  f (-x) = (-x)3 + 2(-x) = -x3 - 2x
 This does not return us to the original function, so this function is not even.

 We can now try also applying a horizontal reflection:

 - f (-x) = -(-x3 - 2x) = x3 + 2x

 Since - f (-x) = f (x) , this is an odd function.

Stretches and Compressions

With shifts, we saw the effect of adding or subtracting to the inputs or outputs of a
function. We now explore the effects of multiplying the inputs or outputs.

Remember, we can transform the inside (input values) of a function or we can transform
the outside (output values) of a function. Each change has a specific effect that can be
seen graphically.

Example 13
 A function P(t) models the growth of a population of
 fruit flies. The growth is shown in the graph. A
 scientist is comparing this to another population, Q, that
 grows the same way, but starts twice as large. Sketch a
 graph of this population.

 Since the population is always twice as large, the new
 population's output values are always twice the original
 function output values. Graphically, this would look
 like the second graph shown.

 Symbolically, Q(t) = 2P(t)

 This means that for any input t, the value of the Q
 function is twice the value of the P function. Notice the
 effect on the graph is a vertical stretching of the graph,
 where every point doubles its distance from the
 horizontal axis. The input values, t, stay the same while
 the output values are twice as large as before.
                                                Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions 75

Vertical Stretch/Compression
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as
g(x) = kf (x) , where k is a constant
then g(x) is a vertical stretch or compression of the function f(x).

If k > 1, then the graph will be stretched
If 0< k < 1, then the graph will be compressed
If k < 0, then there will be combination of a vertical stretch or compression with a
vertical reflection

Example 14
 A function f(x) is given as a table below. Create a table for the function g(x) = 1 f (x)
                                                                                                     2

x 2        4                6  8

f(x) 1     3                7  11

The formula g(x) = 1 f (x) tells us that the output values of g are half of the output
                          2

values of f with the same inputs. For example, we know that f (4) = 3 . Then

g(4) = 1 f (4) = 1 (3) = 3
2       2     2

x 2        4                6  8

g(x) 1/2 3/2 7/2 11/2

The result is that the function g(x) has been compressed vertically by . Each output
value has been cut in half, so the graph would now be half the original height.

Example 15
 The graph shown is a transformation of the toolkit
 function f (x) = x3 . Relate this new function g(x) to
 f(x), then find a formula for g(x).

 When trying to determine a vertical stretch or shift, it
 is helpful to look for a point on the graph that is
 relatively clear. In this graph, it appears that g(2) = 2 .
 With the basic cubic function at the same input,
  f (2) = 23 = 8 .
76 Chapter 1

Based on that, it appears that the outputs of g are  the outputs of the function f, since
g(2) = 1 f (2) .

         4

From this we can fairly safely conclude that:
g(x) = 1 f (x)

         4

We can write a formula for g by using the definition of the function f

g(x) = 1 f (x) = 1 x3
4             4

Now we consider changes to the inside of a function.

Example 16
 Returning to the fruit fly population we looked at earlier, suppose the scientist is now
 comparing it to a population that progresses through its lifespan twice as fast as the
 original population. In other words, this new population, R, will progress in 1 hour the
 same amount the original population did in 2 hours, and in 2 hours, will progress as
 much as the original population did in 4 hours. Sketch a graph of this population.

 Symbolically, we could write
  R(1) = P(2)
  R(2) = P(4) , and in general,
  R(t) = P(2t)

Graphing this,                Transformed, R(t)
   Original population, P(t)

Note the effect on the graph is a horizontal compression, where all input values are half
their original distance from the vertical axis.

Horizontal Stretch/Compression
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as
g(x) = f (kx) , where k is a constant
then g(x) is a horizontal stretch or compression of the function f(x).

If k > 1, then the graph will be compressed by 1k
If 0< k < 1, then the graph will be stretched by 1k
If k < 0, then there will be combination of a horizontal stretch or compression with a
horizontal reflection.

Example 17
                                                                                                      1 

 A function f(x) is given as a table below. Create a table for the function g(x) = f  x
                                                                                                      2

f(x) 1  3  7  11

                           1 
The formula g(x) = f  x tells us that the output values for g are the same as the

                           2 
output values for the function f at an input half the size. Notice that we don't have

                                                                  1 
enough information to determine g(2) since g(2) = f   2 = f (1) , and we do not

                                                                  2 
have a value for f (1) in our table. Our input values to g will need to be twice as large
to get inputs for f that we can evaluate. For example, we can determine g(4) since

           1 
g(4) = f   4 = f (2) = 1.

           2 

x 4     8  12 16

g(x) 1  3  7  11

Since each input value has been doubled, the result is that the function g(x) has been
stretched horizontally by 2.
78 Chapter 1

Example 18
 Two graphs are shown below. Relate the function g(x) to f(x).

 The graph of g(x) looks like the graph of f(x) horizontally compressed. Since f(x) ends at
 (6,4) and g(x) ends at (2,4) we can see that the x values have been compressed by 1/3,

 because 6(1/3) = 2. We might also notice that g(2) = f (6), and g(1) = f (3). Either
 way, we can describe this relationship as g(x) = f (3x). This is a horizontal

 compression by 1/3.

Notice that the coefficient needed for a horizontal stretch or compression is the
reciprocal of the stretch or compression. To stretch the graph horizontally by 4, we need

                                              1 
a coefficient of 1/4 in our function: f  x  . This means the input values must be four

                                              4 
times larger to produce the same result, requiring the input to be larger, causing the
horizontal stretching.

Try it Now
4. Write a formula for the toolkit square root function horizontally stretched by three.

It is useful to note that for most toolkit functions, a horizontal stretch or vertical stretch
can be represented in other ways. For example, a horizontal compression of the function

f ( x) = x2 by  would result in a new function g ( x) = (2x)2 , but this can also be written
as g ( x) = 4x2 , a vertical stretch of f(x) by 4. When writing a formula for a transformed

toolkit, we only need to find one transformation that would produce the graph.
                                                  Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions 79

Combining Transformations

When combining transformations, it is very important to consider the order of the
transformations. For example, vertically shifting by 3 and then vertically stretching by 2
does not create the same graph as vertically stretching by 2 then vertically shifting by 3.

When we see an expression like 2 f (x) + 3 , which transformation should we start with?
The answer here follows nicely from order of operations, for outside transformations.
Given the output value of f(x), we first multiply by 2, causing the vertical stretch, then
add 3, causing the vertical shift. (Multiplication before Addition)

 Combining Vertical Transformations
 When combining vertical transformations written in the form af (x) + k ,
 first vertically stretch by a, then vertically shift by k.

Horizontal transformations are a little trickier to think about. When we write
g(x) = f (2x + 3) for example, we have to think about how the inputs to the g function
relate to the inputs to the f function. Suppose we know f (7) = 12 . What input to g
would produce that output? In other words, what value of x will allow
g(x) = f (2x + 3) = f (12) ? We would need 2x + 3 = 12 . To solve for x, we would first
subtract 3, resulting in horizontal shift, then divide by 2, causing a horizontal
compression.

 Combining Horizontal Transformations
 When combining horizontal transformations written in the form f (bx + p) ,
 first horizontally shift by p, then horizontally stretch by 1/b.

This format ends up being very difficult to work with, since it is usually much easier to
horizontally stretch a graph before shifting. We can work around this by factoring inside
the function.

                   p 
f (bx + p) = f b x + 

                   b 
Factoring in this way allows us to horizontally stretch first, then shift horizontally.

 Combining Horizontal Transformations (Factored Form)
 When combining horizontal transformations written in the form f (b(x + h)) ,
 first horizontally stretch by 1/b, then horizontally shift by h.
80 Chapter 1

 Independence of Horizontal and Vertical Transformations
 Horizontal and vertical transformations are independent. It does not matter
 whether horizontal or vertical transformations are done first.

Example 19
 Given the table of values for the function f(x) below, create a table of values for the
 function g(x) = 2 f (3x) + 1

x 6     12 18 24

f(x) 10 14 15 17

There are 3 steps to this transformation and we will work from the inside out. Starting
with the horizontal transformations, f (3x) is a horizontal compression by 1/3, which

means we multiply each x value by 1/3.

x    2 4 6 8

f (3x) 10 14 15 17

Looking now to the vertical transformations, we start with the vertical stretch, which
will multiply the output values by 2. We apply this to the previous transformation.

x    2 4 6 8

2 f (3x) 20 28 30 34

Finally, we can apply the vertical shift, which will add 1 to all the output values.

x                           2 4 6 8

   g(x) = 2 f (3x) + 1 21 29 31 35

Example 20
                                                                         1 

 Using the graph of f(x) below, sketch a graph of k(x) = f  x + 1 - 3
                                                                         2 

To make things simpler, we'll start by factoring out

the inside of the function

1    1                      
f  x + 1 - 3 = f  (x + 2) - 3
2    2                      

By factoring the inside, we can first horizontally
stretch by 2, as indicated by the  on the inside of
the function. Remember twice the size of 0 is still 0,
so the point (0,2) remains at (0,2) while the point
(2,0) will stretch to (4,0).
                                                  Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions 81

 Next, we horizontally shift left by 2 units, as indicated by the x+2.

 Last, we vertically shift down by 3 to complete our sketch, as indicated by the -3 on the
 outside of the function.

 Horizontal stretch by 2 Horizontal shift left by 2 Vertical shift down 3

Example 21
 Write an equation for the transformed graph of the quadratic function shown.

 Since this is a quadratic function, first consider what
 the basic quadratic tool kit function looks like and how
 this has changed. Observing the graph, we notice
 several transformations:

 The original tool kit function has been flipped over the
 x axis, some kind of stretch or compression has
 occurred, and we can see a shift to the right 3 units and
 a shift up 1 unit.

 In total there are four operations:
 Vertical reflection, requiring a negative sign outside the function
 Vertical Stretch or Horizontal Compression*
 Horizontal Shift Right 3 units, which tells us to put x-3 on the inside of the function
 Vertical Shift up 1 unit, telling us to add 1 on the outside of the function
 * It is unclear from the graph whether it is showing a vertical stretch or a horizontal
 compression. For the quadratic, it turns out we could represent it either way, so we'll
 use a vertical stretch. You may be able to determine the vertical stretch by observation.

 By observation, the basic tool kit function has a vertex at (0, 0) and symmetrical points
 at (1, 1) and (-1, 1). These points are one unit up and one unit over from the vertex.
 The new points on the transformed graph are one unit away horizontally but 2 units
 away vertically. They have been stretched vertically by two.
82 Chapter 1

Not everyone can see this by simply looking at the graph. If you can, great, but if not,
we can solve for it. First, we will write the equation for this graph, with an unknown
vertical stretch.

f (x) = x2                        The original function
- f (x) = -x2                     Vertically reflected
- af (x) = -ax2                   Vertically stretched
- af (x - 3) = -a(x - 3)2         Shifted right 3
- af (x - 3) +1 = -a(x - 3)2 +1   Shifted up 1

We now know our graph is going to have an equation of the form g(x) = -a(x - 3)2 +1.
To find the vertical stretch, we can identify any point on the graph (other than the
highest point), such as the point (2,-1), which tells us g(2) = -1. Using our general
formula, and substituting 2 for x, and -1 for g(x)
-1 = -a(2 - 3)2 + 1

-1 = -a +1

- 2 = -a

2=a

This tells us that to produce the graph we need a vertical stretch by two.
The function that produces this graph is therefore g(x) = -2(x - 3)2 +1.

 The basic reciprocal squared function is increasing on
  (-,0) and decreasing on (0, ) . Because of the vertical
 flip, the g(x) function will be decreasing on the left and
 increasing on the right. The horizontal shift right by 1 will
 also shift these intervals to the right one. From this, we can
 determine g(x) will be increasing on (1, ) and decreasing
 on (-,1) . We also could graph the transformation to help
 us determine these intervals.

Section 1.6 Inverse Functions

A fashion designer is travelling to Milan for a fashion show. He asks his assistant, Betty,

what 75 degrees Fahrenheit is in Celsius, and after a quick search on Google, she finds

the formula C = 5 (F - 32) . Using this formula, she calculates 5 (75 - 32)  24 degrees
9                                                               9

Celsius. The next day, the designer sends his assistant the week's weather forecast for

Milan, and asks her to convert the temperatures to Fahrenheit.

At first, Betty might consider using the formula she has already found to do the
conversions. After all, she knows her algebra, and can easily solve the equation for F
after substituting a value for C. For example, to convert 26 degrees Celsius, she could
write:
26 = 5 (F - 32)

      9
26  9 = F - 32

     5
F = 26  9 + 32  79

          5

After considering this option for a moment, she realizes that solving the equation for each
of the temperatures would get awfully tedious, and realizes that since evaluation is easier
than solving, it would be much more convenient to have a different formula, one which
takes the Celsius temperature and outputs the Fahrenheit temperature. This is the idea of
an inverse function, where the input becomes the output and the output becomes the
input.

 Inverse Function
 If f (a) = b , then a function g(x) is an inverse of f if g(b) = a .
 The inverse of f(x) is typically notated f -1(x) , which is read "f inverse of x", so
 equivalently, if f (a) = b then f -1(b) = a .

Important: The raised -1 used in the notation for inverse functions is simply a notation,
and does not designate an exponent or power of -1.
94 Chapter 1

Example 1
 If for a particular function, f (2) = 4 , what do we know about the inverse?

 The inverse function reverses which quantity is input and which quantity is output, so if
  f (2) = 4 , then f -1(4) = 2 .

 Alternatively, if you want to re-name the inverse function g(x), then g(4) = 2

Try it Now
1. Given that h-1(6) = 2 , what do we know about the original function h(x)?

Notice that the original function and the inverse function undo each other. If f (a) = b ,
then f -1(b) = a , returning us to the original input. More simply put, if you compose
these functions together you get the original input as your answer.

f -1 ( f (a)) = a and f ( f -1(b)) = b

Domain of f            Range of f
             f (x)

a                      b

             f -1 (x)

Since the outputs of the function f are the inputs to f -1 , the range of f is also the domain
of f -1 . Likewise, since the inputs to f are the outputs of f -1 , the domain of f is the range
of f -1 .

Basically, like how the input and output values switch, the domain & ranges switch as
well. But be careful, because sometimes a function doesn't even have an inverse
function, or only has an inverse on a limited domain. For example, the inverse of
f (x) = x is f -1(x) = x2 , since a square "undoes" a square root, but it is only the

inverse of f(x) on the domain [0,), since that is the range of f (x) = x .

Example 2
 The function f (x) = 2x has domain (-, ) and range (0, ) , what would we expect
 the domain and range of f -1 to be?

We would expect f -1 to swap the domain and range of f, so f -1 would have domain
(0, ) and range (-, ) .
                                                               Section 1.6 Inverse Functions 95

Example 3
 A function f(t) is given as a table below, showing distance in miles that a car has
 traveled in t minutes. Find and interpret f -1(70)

           t (minutes) 30 50 70 90
           f(t) (miles) 20 40 60 70

 The inverse function takes an output of f and returns an input for f. So in the expression
  f -1(70) , the 70 is an output value of the original function, representing 70 miles. The
 inverse will return the corresponding input of the original function f, 90 minutes, so
  f -1(70) = 90 . Interpreting this, it means that to drive 70 miles, it took 90 minutes.

 Alternatively, recall the definition of the inverse was that if f (a) = b then f -1(b) = a .
 By this definition, if you are given f -1(70) = a then you are looking for a value a so
 that f (a) = 70 . In this case, we are looking for a t so that f (t) = 70 , which is when t =
 90.

2. Using the table below

              t (minutes) 30 50 60 70 90

         a. f (60)
        b. f -1 (60)

Example 4
 A function g(x) is given as a graph below. Find g(3) and g -1(3)

 To evaluate g(3) , we find 3 on the
 horizontal axis and find the corresponding
 output value on the vertical axis. The point
 (3, 1) tells us that g(3) = 1
 To evaluate g -1(3) , recall that by definition
  g -1(3) means g(x) = 3. By looking for the
 output value 3 on the vertical axis we find
 the point (5, 3) on the graph, which means
 g(5) = 3, so by definition g -1(3) = 5 .
96 Chapter 1

Try it Now
3. Using the graph in Example 4 above

   a. find g -1(1)
   b. estimate g -1 (4)

Example 5
 Returning to our designer's assistant, find a formula for the inverse function that gives
 Fahrenheit temperature given a Celsius temperature.

 A quick Google search would find the inverse function, but alternatively, Betty might
 look back at how she solved for the Fahrenheit temperature for a specific Celsius value,
 and repeat the process in general
  C = 5 (F - 32)

       9
  C  9 = F - 32

      5
  F = 9 C + 32

       5

 By solving in general, we have uncovered the inverse function. If
  C = h(F ) = 5 (F - 32)

                 9
 Then
  F = h -1 (C) = 9 C + 32

                   5
 In this case, we introduced a function h to represent the conversion since the input and
 output variables are descriptive, and writing C -1 could get confusing.

It is important to note that not all functions will have an inverse function. Since the
inverse f -1(x) takes an output of f and returns an input of f, in order for f -1 to itself be
a function, then each output of f (input to f -1 ) must correspond to exactly one input of f
(output of f -1 ) in order for f -1 to be a function. You might recall that this is the
definition of a one-to-one function.

 Properties of Inverses
 In order for a function to have an inverse, it must be a one-to-one function.
                                                               Section 1.6 Inverse Functions 97

In some cases, it is desirable to have an inverse for a function even though the function is
not one-to-one. In those cases, we can often limit the domain of the original function to
an interval on which the function is one-to-one, then find an inverse only on that interval.

If you have not already done so, go back to the toolkit functions that were not one-to-one
and limit or restrict the domain of the original function so that it is one-to-one. If you are
not sure how to do this, proceed to Example 6.

Example 6
 The quadratic function h(x) = x2 is not one-to-one. Find a domain on which this
 function is one-to-one, and find the inverse on that domain.

 We can limit the domain to [0, ) to restrict the graph to a
 portion that is one-to-one, and find an inverse on this limited
 domain.

 You may have already guessed that since we undo a square
 with a square root, the inverse of h(x) = x2 on this domain
 is h-1 (x) = x .

 You can also solve for the inverse function algebraically. If h(x) = x2 , we can
 introduce the variable y to represent the output values, allowing us to write y = x2 . To
 find the inverse we solve for the input variable

 To solve for x we take the square root of each side. y = x2 and get y = x , so
  x =  y . We have restricted x to being non-negative, so we'll use the positive square
 root, x = y or h-1 ( y) = y . In cases like this where the variables are not descriptive,
 it is common to see the inverse function rewritten with the variable x: h-1(x) = x .
 Rewriting the inverse using the variable x is often required for graphing inverse
 functions using calculators or computers.

 Note that the domain and range of the square root function do
 correspond with the range and domain of the quadratic function
 on the limited domain. In fact, if we graph h(x) on the
 restricted domain and h-1(x) on the same axes, we can notice
 symmetry: the graph of h-1(x) is the graph of h(x) reflected
 over the line y = x.

Example 7
 Given the graph of f(x) shown, sketch a graph of f -1(x) .
 This is a one-to-one function, so we will be able to sketch
 an inverse. Note that the graph shown has an apparent
 domain of (0,) and range of (-,), so the inverse will
 have a domain of (-,) and range of (0,).
 Reflecting this graph of the line y = x, the point (1, 0)
 reflects to (0, 1), and the point (4, 2) reflects to (2, 4).

Linear Functions

Chapter one was a window that gave us a peek into the entire course. Our goal was to
understand the basic structure of functions and function notation, the toolkit functions,
domain and range, how to recognize and understand composition and transformations of
functions and how to understand and utilize inverse functions. With these basic
components in hand we will further research the specific details and intricacies of each
type of function in our toolkit and use them to model the world around us.

 Mathematical Modeling
 As we approach day to day life we often need to quantify the things around us, giving
 structure and numeric value to various situations. This ability to add structure enables
 us to make choices based on patterns we see that are weighted and systematic. With
 this structure in place we can model and even predict behavior to make decisions.
 Adding a numerical structure to a real world situation is called Mathematical
 Modeling.

When modeling real world scenarios, there are some common growth patterns that are
regularly observed. We will devote this chapter and the rest of the book to the study of
the functions used to model these growth patterns.

Section 2.1 Linear Functions

As you hop into a taxicab in Las Vegas, the meter will immediately read $3.50; this is the
"drop" charge made when the taximeter is activated. After that initial fee, the taximeter
will add $2.76 for each mile the taxi drives1. In this scenario, the total taxi fare depends
upon the number of miles ridden in the taxi, and we can ask whether it is possible to
model this type of scenario with a function. Using descriptive variables, we choose m for
miles and C for Cost in dollars as a function of miles: C(m).

1 Nevada Taxicab Authority, retrieved Aug 4, 2020. There is also a waiting fee assessed when the taxi is
waiting at red lights, but we'll ignore that in this discussion.
This chapter is part of Precalculus: An Investigation of Functions  Lippman & Rasmussen 2020.

102 Chapter 2

We know for certain that C(0) = 3.50 , since the $3.50 drop charge is assessed regardless

of how many miles are driven. Since $2.67 is added for each mile driven, then
C(1) = 3.50 + 2.67 = 6.17 .

If we then drove a second mile, another $2.67 would be added to the cost:
C(2) = 3.50 + 2.67 + 2.67 = 3.50 + 2.67(2) = 8.84

If we drove a third mile, another $2.67 would be added to the cost:
C(3) = 3.50 + 2.67 + 2.67 + 2.67 = 3.50 + 2.67(3) = 11.51

From this we might observe the pattern, and conclude that if m miles are driven,
C(m) = 3.50 + 2.67m because we start with a $3.50 drop fee and then for each mile

increase we add $2.67.

It is good to verify that the units make sense in this equation. The $3.50 drop charge is

measured in dollars; the $2.67 charge is measured in dollars per mile.

                dollars        (m miles )
C(m) = 3.50dollars +  2.67
                            mile 

When dollars per mile are multiplied by a number of miles, the result is a number of

dollars, matching the units on the 3.50, and matching the desired units for the C function.

Notice this equation C(m) = 3.50 + 2.67m consisted of two quantities. The first is the

fixed $3.50 charge which does not change based on the value of the input. The second is
the $2.67 dollars per mile value, which is a rate of change. In the equation, this rate of
change is multiplied by the input value.

Looking at this same problem in table format we can also see the cost changes by $2.67
for every 1 mile increase.

m  0             1          2      3
                                   11.51
C(m) 3.50        6.17 8.84

It is important here to note that in this equation, the rate of change is constant; over any
interval, the rate of change is the same.

Graphing this equation, C(m) = 3.50 + 2.67m we see
the shape is a line, which is how these functions get
their name: linear functions.

When the number of miles is zero the cost is $3.50,
giving the point (0, 3.50) on the graph. This is the
vertical or C(m) intercept. The graph is increasing in a
straight line from left to right because for each mile
the cost goes up by $2.67; this rate remains consistent.
                                                                Section 2.1 Linear Functions 103

In this example, you have seen the taxicab cost modeled in words, an equation, a table
and in graphical form. Whenever possible, ensure that you can link these four
representations together to continually build your skills. It is important to note that you
will not always be able to find all 4 representations for a problem and so being able to
work with all 4 forms is very important.

Linear Function

A linear function is a function whose graph produces a line. Linear functions can
always be written in the form

f (x) = b + mx   or  f (x) = mx + b ; they're equivalent

where

b is the initial or starting value of the function (when input, x = 0), and
m is the constant rate of change of the function

Many people like to write linear functions in the form f (x) = b + mx because it

corresponds to the way we tend to speak: "The output starts at b and increases at a
rate of m."

For this reason alone we will use the f (x) = b + mx form for many of the examples,
but remember they are equivalent and can be written correctly both ways.

Slope and Increasing/Decreasing
m is the constant rate of change of the function (also called slope). The slope
determines if the function is an increasing function or a decreasing function.
f (x) = b + mx is an increasing function if m  0

f (x) = b + mx is a decreasing function if m  0

If m = 0 , the rate of change zero, and the function f (x) = b + 0x = b is just a
horizontal line passing through the point (0, b), neither increasing nor decreasing.

Example 1
 Marcus currently owns 200 songs in his iTunes collection. Every month, he adds 15
 new songs. Write a formula for the number of songs, N, in his iTunes collection as a
 function of the number of months, m. How many songs will he own in a year?

 The initial value for this function is 200, since he currently owns 200 songs, so
  N (0) = 200 . The number of songs increases by 15 songs per month, so the rate of
 change is 15 songs per month. With this information, we can write the formula:
  N (m) = 200 + 15m .
104 Chapter 2

 N(m) is an increasing linear function. With this formula we can predict how many
 songs he will have in 1 year (12 months):
  N (12) = 200 + 15(12) = 200 + 180 = 380 . Marcus will have 380 songs in 12 months.

   amount of money you save after y years, if you start with nothing.
   "The most important thing, spend less than you earn!2"

Calculating Rate of Change
Given two values for the input, x1 and x2 , and two corresponding values for the output,
y1 and y2 , or a set of points, (x1, y1) and (x2 , y2 ) , if we wish to find a linear
function that contains both points we can calculate the rate of change, m:
m = change in output = y = y2 - y1

      change in input x x2 - x1

Rate of change of a linear function is also called the slope of the line.

Note in function notation, y1 = f (x1) and y2 = f (x2 ) , so we could equivalently write

m = f ( x2 ) - f ( x1 )

          x2 - x1

Example 2
 The population of a city increased from 23,400 to 27,800 between 2002 and 2006. Find
 the rate of change of the population during this time span.

The rate of change will relate the change in population to the change in time. The

population increased by 27800 - 23400 = 4400 people over the 4 year time interval. To

find the rate of change, the number of people per year the population changed by:

4400 people = 1100 people = 1100 people per year
4 years  year

Notice that we knew the population was increasing, so we would expect our value for m
to be positive. This is a quick way to check to see if your value is reasonable.

Example 3
 The pressure, P, in pounds per square inch (PSI) on a diver depends upon their depth
 below the water surface, d, in feet, following the equation P(d ) = 14.696 + 0.434d .
 Interpret the components of this function.

 The rate of change, or slope, 0.434 would have units output = pressure = PSI . This
                                                                     input depth ft

 tells us the pressure on the diver increases by 0.434 PSI for each foot their depth
 increases.

 The initial value, 14.696, will have the same units as the output, so this tells us that at a
 depth of 0 feet, the pressure on the diver will be 14.696 PSI.

Example 4
 If f (x) is a linear function, f (3) = -2 , and f (8) = 1, find the rate of change.

  f (3) = -2 tells us that the input 3 corresponds with the output -2, and f (8) = 1 tells us
 that the input 8 corresponds with the output 1. To find the rate of change, we divide the
 change in output by the change in input:

  m = change in output = 1 - (-2) = 3 . If desired we could also write this as m = 0.6
        change in input 8 - 3 5

 Note that it is not important which pair of values comes first in the subtractions so long
 as the first output value used corresponds with the first input value used.

2. Given the two points (2, 3) and (0, 4), find the rate of change. Is this function

   increasing or decreasing?

We can now find the rate of change given two input-output pairs, and can write an
equation for a linear function once we have the rate of change and initial value. If we
have two input-output pairs and they do not include the initial value of the function, then
we will have to solve for it.
106 Chapter 2

Example 5
 Write an equation for the linear function graphed to the
 right.

 Looking at the graph, we might notice that it passes
 through the points (0, 7) and (4, 4). From the first
 value, we know the initial value of the function is b = 7,
 so in this case we will only need to calculate the rate of
 change:

  m= 4-7 = -3
        4-0 4

 This allows us to write the equation:
  f (x) = 7 - 3 x

                4

Example 6
 If f (x) is a linear function, f (3) = -2 , and f (8) = 1, find an equation for the function.

In example 3, we computed the rate of change to be m = 3 . In this case, we do not
                                                                       5

know the initial value f (0) , so we will have to solve for it. Using the rate of change, we

know the equation will have the form f (x) = b + 3 x . Since we know the value of the
                                                            5

function when x = 3, we can evaluate the function at 3.

f (3) = b + 3 (3)  Since we know that f (3) = -2 , we can substitute on the left side
             5     This leaves us with an equation we can solve for the initial value

- 2 = b + 3 (3)
           5

b = -2 - 9 = -19
           55

Combining this with the value for the rate of change, we can now write a formula for
this function:
 f (x) = -19 + 3 x

Example 7

 Working as an insurance salesperson, Ilya earns a base salary and a commission on each
 new policy, so Ilya's weekly income, I, depends on the number of new policies, n, he
 sells during the week. Last week he sold 3 new policies, and earned $760 for the week.
 The week before, he sold 5 new policies, and earned $920. Find an equation for I(n),
 and interpret the meaning of the components of the equation.

The given information gives us two input-output pairs: (3,760) and (5,920). We start

by finding the rate of change.

m = 920 - 760 = 160 = 80
5-3              2

Keeping track of units can help us interpret this quantity. Income increased by $160
when the number of policies increased by 2, so the rate of change is $80 per policy; Ilya
earns a commission of $80 for each policy sold during the week.

We can then solve for the initial value

I (n) = b + 80n           then when n = 3, I (3) = 760 , giving

760 = b + 80(3)           this allows us to solve for b

b = 760 - 80(3) = 520

This value is the starting value for the function. This is Ilya's income when n = 0,
which means no new policies are sold. We can interpret this as Ilya's base salary for
the week, which does not depend upon the number of policies sold.

Writing the final equation:
I (n) = 520 + 80n
Our final interpretation is: Ilya's base salary is $520 per week and he earns an
additional $80 commission for each policy sold each week.

 Given the table below write a linear equation that represents the table values

weeks

P(w), number 1000 1080 1160 1240

of rats

We can see from the table that the initial value of rats is 1000 so in the linear format
P(w) = b + mw , b = 1000.

Rather than solving for m, we can notice from the table that the population goes up by
80 for every 2 weeks that pass. This rate is consistent from week 0, to week 2, 4, and 6.
The rate of change is 80 rats per 2 weeks. This can be simplified to 40 rats per week and
we can write
P(w) = b + mw as P(w) = 1000 + 40w

If you didn't notice this from the table you could still solve for the slope using any two

points from the table. For example, using (2, 1080) and (6, 1240),

m = 1240 -1080 = 160 = 40 rats per week

Section 2.2 Graphs of Linear Functions

When we are working with a new function, it is useful to know as much as we can about
the function: its graph, where the function is zero, and any other special behaviors of the
function. We will begin this exploration of linear functions with a look at graphs.

When graphing a linear function, there are three basic ways to graph it:
    1) By plotting points (at least 2) and drawing a line through the points
    2) Using the initial value (output when x = 0) and rate of change (slope)
    3) Using transformations of the identity function f (x) = x

Example 1
 Graph f (x) = 5 - 2 x by plotting points
                        3

 In general, we evaluate the function at two or more inputs to find at least two points on
 the graph. Usually it is best to pick input values that will "work nicely" in the equation.
 In this equation, multiples of 3 will work nicely due to the 2 in the equation, and of

                                                                           3
 course using x = 0 to get the vertical intercept. Evaluating f(x) at x = 0, 3 and 6:
  f (0) = 5 - 2 (0) = 5

               3
  f (3) = 5 - 2 (3) = 3

               3
  f (6) = 5 - 2 (6) = 1

               3

 These evaluations tell us that the points (0,5),
 (3,3), and (6,1) lie on the graph of the line.
 Plotting these points and drawing a line through
 them gives us the graph.

When using the initial value and rate of change to graph, we need to consider the
graphical interpretation of these values. Remember the initial value of the function is the
output when the input is zero, so in the equation f (x) = b + mx , the graph includes the
point (0, b). On the graph, this is the vertical intercept - the point where the graph
crosses the vertical axis.

For the rate of change, it is helpful to recall that we calculated this value as
m = change of output

       change of input
                                                   Section 2.2 Graphs of Linear Functions 115

From a graph of a line, this tells us that if we
divide the vertical difference, or rise, of the
function outputs by the horizontal difference,
or run, of the inputs, we will obtain the rate
of change, also called slope of the line.

m = change of output = rise
       change of input run

Notice that this ratio is the same regardless of
which two points we use.

 Graphical Interpretation of a Linear Equation
 Graphically, in the equation f (x) = b + mx ,

 b is the vertical intercept of the graph and tells us we can start our graph at (0, b)

 m is the slope of the line and tells us how far to rise & run to get to the next point

 Once we have at least 2 points, we can extend the graph of the line to the left and
 right.

Example 2
 Graph f (x) = 5 - 2 x using the vertical intercept and slope.
                        3

 The vertical intercept of the function is (0, 5), giving us a point on the graph of the line.

 The slope is - 2 . This tells us that for every 3 units the graph "runs" in the horizontal,
                    3

 the vertical "rise" decreases by 2 units.

 In graphing, we can use this by first plotting
 our vertical intercept on the graph, then
 using the slope to find a second point. From
 the initial value (0, 5) the slope tells us that
 if we move to the right 3, we will move
 down 2, moving us to the point (3, 3). We
 can continue this again to find a third point
 at (6, 1). Finally, extend the line to the left
 and right, containing these points.

1. Consider that the slope - 2 could also be written as 2 . Using 2 , find another
               3                                 -3  -3

point on the graph that has a negative x value.

Another option for graphing is to use transformations of the identity function f (x) = x .

In the equation f (x) = mx , the m is
acting as the vertical stretch of the
identity function. When m is
negative, there is also a vertical
reflection of the graph. Looking at
some examples:

In f (x) = mx + b , the b acts as the

vertical shift, moving the graph up
and down without affecting the
slope of the line. Some examples:
                                                   Section 2.2 Graphs of Linear Functions 117

Using Vertical Stretches or Compressions along with Vertical Shifts is another way to
look at identifying different types of linear functions. Although this may not be the
easiest way for you to graph this type of function, make sure you practice each method.

Example 3
 Graph f (x) = -3 + 1 x using transformations.
                          2

The equation is the graph of the identity function vertically compressed by  and
vertically shifted down 3.

Vertical compression  combined with Vertical shift

Notice how this nicely compares to the other method where the vertical intercept is found
at (0, -3) and to get to another point we rise (go up vertically) by 1 unit and run (go
horizontally) by 2 units to get to the next point (2, -2), and the next one (4, -1). In these
three points (0, -3), (2, -2), and (4, -1), the output values change by +1, and the x values
change by +2, corresponding with the slope m = .

Example 4
 Match each equation with one of the lines in the graph below
  f (x) = 2x + 3
  g(x) = 2x - 3
  h(x) = -2x + 3
  j(x) = 1 x + 3
           2

 Only one graph has a vertical intercept of -
 3, so we can immediately match that graph
 with g(x).
118 Chapter 2

 For the three graphs with a vertical
 intercept at 3, only one has a negative
 slope, so we can match that line with h(x).
 Of the other two, the steeper line would
 have a larger slope, so we can match that
 graph with equation f(x), and the flatter
 line with the equation j(x).

In addition to understanding the basic behavior of a linear function (increasing or
decreasing, recognizing the slope and vertical intercept), it is often helpful to know the
horizontal intercept of the function - where it crosses the horizontal axis.

 Finding Horizontal Intercepts
 The horizontal intercept of the function is where the graph crosses the horizontal
 axis. If a function has a horizontal intercept, you can always find it by solving
 f(x) = 0.

Example 5
 Find the horizontal intercept of f (x) = -3 + 1 x
                                                         2

 Setting the function equal to zero to find what input will put us on the horizontal axis,
  0 = -3 + 1 x

             2
  3= 1x

      2
  x=6

 The graph crosses the horizontal axis at (6,0)
                                                   Section 2.2 Graphs of Linear Functions 119

There are two special cases of lines: a horizontal line and a
vertical line. In a horizontal line like the one graphed to the
right, notice that between any two points, the change in the
outputs is 0. In the slope equation, the numerator will be 0,
resulting in a slope of 0. Using a slope of 0 in the
 f (x) = b + mx , the equation simplifies to f (x) = b .

Notice a horizontal line has a vertical intercept, but no
horizontal intercept (unless it's the line f(x) = 0).

In the case of a vertical line, notice that between any two
points, the change in the inputs is zero. In the slope equation,
the denominator will be zero, and you may recall that we
cannot divide by the zero; the slope of a vertical line is
undefined. You might also notice that a vertical line is not a
function. To write the equation of vertical line, we simply
write input=value, like x = b .
Notice a vertical line has a horizontal intercept, but no vertical
intercept (unless it's the line x = 0).

 Horizontal and Vertical Lines
 Horizontal lines have equations of the form f (x) = b
 Vertical lines have equations of the form x = a

Example 6
 Write an equation for the horizontal line graphed above.

 This line would have equation f (x) = 2

Example 7
 Write an equation for the vertical line graphed above.

 This line would have equation x = 2

   function and find its horizontal intercept.
120 Chapter 2

Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

When two lines are graphed together, the lines will be parallel if they are increasing at
the same rate - if the rates of change are the same. In this case, the graphs will never
cross (unless they're the same line).

Parallel Lines
Two lines are parallel if the slopes are equal (or, if both lines are vertical).

In other words, given two linear equations f (x) = b + m1x and g(x) = b + m2 x, the
lines will be parallel if m1 = m2 .

Example 8
 Find a line parallel to f (x) = 6 + 3x that passes through the point (3, 0)

We know the line we're looking for will have the same slope as the given line, m = 3.

Using this and the given point, we can solve for the new line's vertical intercept:

g(x) = b + 3x  then at (3, 0),

0 = b + 3(3)

b = -9

 The line we're looking for is g(x) = -9 + 3x

If two lines are not parallel, one other interesting possibility is that the lines are
perpendicular, which means the lines form a right angle (90 degree angle - a square
corner) where they meet. In this case, the slopes when multiplied together will equal -1.
Solving for one slope leads us to the definition:

Perpendicular Lines

Given two linear equations f (x) = b + m1x and g(x) = b + m2 x
The lines will be perpendicular if m1m2 = -1, and so m2 = - 1

                                                                           m1
We often say the slope of a perpendicular line is the "negative reciprocal" of the other
line's slope.

Example 9

Find the slope of a line perpendicular to a line with:

a) a slope of 2.  b) a slope of -4.  c) a slope of 2 .
                                                     3

If the original line had slope 2, the perpendicular line's slope would be m2 = -1
                                                                                                 2

If the original line had slope -4, the perpendicular line's slope would be m2 = - 1 = 1
                                                                                                 -4 4

If the original line had slope 2 , the perpendicular line's slope would be m2 = -1 = - 3
                                  3 23 2

Example 10
 Find the equation of a line perpendicular to f (x) = 6 + 3x and passing through the point
 (3, 0)

The original line has slope m = 3. The perpendicular line will have slope m = - 1 .
                                                                                                  3

Using this and the given point, we can find the equation for the line.

g(x) = b - 1 x    then at (3, 0),
             3

0 = b - 1 (3)
        3

b =1

The line we're looking for is g(x) = 1 - 1 x .

3. Given the line h(t) = -4 + 2t , find an equation for the line passing through (0, 0) that

   is: a) parallel to h(t). b) perpendicular to h(t).

Example 12
 A line passes through the points (-2, 6) and (4, 5). Find the equation of a perpendicular
 line that passes through the point (4, 5).

 From the two given points on the reference line, we can calculate the slope of that line:
  m1 = 5 - 6 = -1

         4 - (-2) 6
122 Chapter 2

The perpendicular line will have slope
m2 = -1 = 6

       -1
          6

We can then solve for the vertical intercept that makes the line pass through the desired

point:

g(x) = b + 6x          then at (4, 5),

5 = b + 6(4)

b = -19
Giving the line g(x) = -19 + 6x

Intersections of Lines

The graphs of two lines will intersect if they are not parallel. They will intersect at the
point that satisfies both equations. To find this point when the equations are given as
functions, we can solve for an input value so that f (x) = g(x) . In other words, we can
set the formulas for the lines equal, and solve for the input that satisfies the equation.

Example 13
 Find the intersection of the lines h(t) = 3t - 4 and j(t) = 5 - t

Setting h(t) = j(t) ,

3t - 4 = 5 - t

4t = 9

t=9
    4

This tells us the lines intersect when the input is 9 .
                                                            4

We can then find the output value of the intersection point

by evaluating either function at this input

j  = 5 - =

These lines intersect at the point  ,  . Looking at the

graph, this result seems reasonable.

Two parallel lines can also intersect if they happen to be the same line. In that case, they
intersect at every point on the lines.

4. Look at the graph in example 13 above and answer the following for the function h(t):

   a. Vertical intercept coordinates
   b. Horizontal intercepts coordinates

   d. Is j(t) parallel or perpendicular to h(t) (or neither)
   e. Is h(t) an Increasing or Decreasing function (or neither)
   f. Write a transformation description from the identity toolkit function f(x) = x

Finding the intersection allows us to answer other questions as well, such as discovering
when one function is larger than another.

Example 14
 Using the functions from the previous example, for what values of t is h(t)  j(t)

 To answer this question, it is helpful first to know where the functions are equal, since
 that is the point where h(t) could switch from being greater to smaller than j(t) or vice-
 versa. From the previous example, we know the functions are equal at t = 9 .

                                                                                              4
 By examining the graph, we can see that h(t), the function with positive slope, is going
 to be larger than the other function to the right of the intersection. So h(t)  j(t) when

Section 2.3 Modeling with Linear Functions

When modeling scenarios with a linear function and solving problems involving
quantities changing linearly, we typically follow the same problem solving strategies that
we would use for any type of function:

 Problem solving strategy
 1) Identify changing quantities, and then carefully and clearly define descriptive

      variables to represent those quantities. When appropriate, sketch a picture or
      define a coordinate system.
 2) Carefully read the problem to identify important information. Look for
      information giving values for the variables, or values for parts of the functional
      model, like slope and initial value.
 3) Carefully read the problem to identify what we are trying to find, identify, solve,
      or interpret.
 4) Identify a solution pathway from the provided information to what we are trying to
      find. Often this will involve checking and tracking units, building a table or even
      finding a formula for the function being used to model the problem.
 5) When needed, find a formula for the function.
 6) Solve or evaluate using the formula you found for the desired quantities.
 7) Reflect on whether your answer is reasonable for the given situation and whether it
      makes sense mathematically.
 8) Clearly convey your result using appropriate units, and answer in full sentences
      when appropriate.

Example 1
 Emily saved up $3500 for her summer visit to Seattle. She anticipates spending $400
 each week on rent, food, and fun. Find and interpret the horizontal intercept and
 determine a reasonable domain and range for this function.

 In the problem, there are two changing quantities: time and money. The amount of
 money she has remaining while on vacation depends on how long she stays. We can
 define our variables, including units.
 Output: M, money remaining, in dollars
 Input: t, time, in weeks

 Reading the problem, we identify two important values. The first, $3500, is the initial
 value for M. The other value appears to be a rate of change - the units of dollars per
 week match the units of our output variable divided by our input variable. She is
 spending money each week, so you should recognize that the amount of money
 remaining is decreasing each week and the slope is negative.
130 Chapter 2

 To answer the first question, looking for the horizontal intercept, it would be helpful to
 have an equation modeling this scenario. Using the intercept and slope provided in the
 problem, we can write the equation: M (t) = 3500 - 400t .

 To find the horizontal intercept, we set the output to zero, and solve for the input:
  0 = 3500 - 400t
  t = 3500 = 8.75

       400

 The horizontal intercept is 8.75 weeks. Since this represents the input value where the
 output will be zero, interpreting this, we could say: Emily will have no money left after
 8.75 weeks.

 When modeling any real life scenario with functions, there is typically a limited domain
 over which that model will be valid - almost no trend continues indefinitely. In this
 case, it certainly doesn't make sense to talk about input values less than zero. It is also
 likely that this model is not valid after the horizontal intercept (unless Emily's going to
 start using a credit card and go into debt).

 The domain represents the set of input values and so the reasonable domain for this
 function is 0  t  8.75 .

 However, in a real world scenario, the rental might be weekly or nightly. She may not
 be able to stay a partial week and so all options should be considered. Emily could stay
 in Seattle for 0 to 8 full weeks (and a couple of days), but would have to go into debt to
 stay 9 full weeks, so restricted to whole weeks, a reasonable domain without going in to
 debt would be 0  t  8 , or 0  t  9 if she went into debt to finish out the last week.

 The range represents the set of output values and she starts with $3500 and ends with $0
 after 8.75 weeks so the corresponding range is 0  M (t)  3500 . If we limit the rental
 to whole weeks, however, the range would change. If she left after 8 weeks because she
 didn't have enough to stay for a full 9 weeks, she would have M(8) = 3500-400(8) =
 $300 dollars left after 8 weeks, giving a range of 300  M (t)  3500 . If she wanted to
 stay the full 9 weeks she would be $100 in debt giving a range of -100  M (t)  3500 .

 Most importantly remember that domain and range are tied together, and what ever you
 decide is most appropriate for the domain (the independent variable) will dictate the
 requirements for the range (the dependent variable).

    been loaded. How much longer will she have to wait for all 80 million rows to load?

Example 2
 Jamal is choosing between two moving companies. The first, U-Haul, charges an up-
 front fee of $20, then 59 cents a mile. The second, Budget, charges an up-front fee of
 $16, then 63 cents a mile3. When will U-Haul be the better choice for Jamal?

 The two important quantities in this problem are the cost, and the number of miles that
 are driven. Since we have two companies to consider, we will define two functions:

 Input: m, miles driven
 Outputs:
 Y(m): cost, in dollars, for renting from U-Haul
 B(m): cost, in dollars, for renting from Budget

 Reading the problem carefully, it appears that we were given an initial cost and a rate of
 change for each company. Since our outputs are measured in dollars but the costs per
 mile given in the problem are in cents, we will need to convert these quantities to match
 our desired units: $0.59 a mile for U-Haul, and $0.63 a mile for Budget.

 Looking to what we're trying to find, we want to know when U-Haul will be the better
 choice. Since all we have to make that decision from is the costs, we are looking for
 when U-Haul will cost less, or when Y (m)  B(m) . The solution pathway will lead us
 to find the equations for the two functions, find the intersection, then look to see where
 the Y(m) function is smaller. Using the rates of change and initial charges, we can write
 the equations:
  Y (m) = 20 + 0.59m
  B(m) = 16 + 0.63m

 These graphs are sketched to the right, with
 Y(m) drawn dashed.

 To find the intersection, we set the
 equations equal and solve:
 Y(m) = B(m)
  20 + 0.59m = 16 + 0.63m
  4 = 0.04m
  m = 100

 This tells us that the cost from the two companies will be the same if 100 miles are
 driven. Either by looking at the graph, or noting that Y(m) is growing at a slower rate,
 we can conclude that U-Haul will be the cheaper price when more than 100 miles are
 driven.

Example 3

 A town's population has been growing linearly. In 2004 the population was 6,200. By
 2009 the population had grown to 8,100. If this trend continues,
 a. Predict the population in 2013
 b. When will the population reach 15000?

The two changing quantities are the population and time. While we could use the actual
year value as the input quantity, doing so tends to lead to very ugly equations, since the
vertical intercept would correspond to the year 0, more than 2000 years ago!
To make things a little nicer, and to make our lives easier too, we will define our input
as years since 2004:
Input: t, years since 2004
Output: P(t), the town's population

The problem gives us two input-output pairs. Converting them to match our defined
variables, the year 2004 would correspond to t = 0, giving the point (0, 6200). Notice
that through our clever choice of variable definition, we have "given" ourselves the
vertical intercept of the function. The year 2009 would correspond to t = 5, giving the
point (5, 8100).

To predict the population in 2013 (t = 9), we would need an equation for the population.

Likewise, to find when the population would reach 15000, we would need to solve for

the input that would provide an output of 15000. Either way, we need an equation. To

find it, we start by calculating the rate of change:

m = 8100 - 6200 = 1900 = 380 people per year
5-0            5

Since we already know the vertical intercept of the line, we can immediately write the
equation:
P(t) = 6200 + 380t

To predict the population in 2013, we evaluate our function at t = 9
P(9) = 6200 + 380(9) = 9620
If the trend continues, our model predicts a population of 9,620 in 2013.

To find when the population will reach 15,000, we can set P(t) = 15000 and solve for t.
15000 = 6200 + 380t
8800 = 380t
t  23.158

Our model predicts the population will reach 15,000 in a little more than 23 years after
2004, or somewhere around the year 2027.

Example 4
 Anna and Emanuel start at the same intersection. Anna walks east at 4 miles per hour
 while Emanuel walks south at 3 miles per hour. They are communicating with a two-
 way radio with a range of 2 miles. How long after they start walking will they fall out
 of radio contact?

 In essence, we can partially answer this question by saying they will fall out of radio
 contact when they are 2 miles apart, which leads us to ask a new question: how long
 will it take them to be 2 miles apart?

 In this problem, our changing quantities are time and the two peoples' positions, but
 ultimately we need to know how long will it take for them to be 2 miles apart. We can
 see that time will be our input variable, so we'll define
 Input: t, time in hours.

 Since it is not obvious how to define our output variables, we'll start by drawing a
 picture.

                                              Anna walking east, 4 miles/hour

                           Distance between them

          Emanuel walking south, 3 miles/hour

 Because of the complexity of this question, it may be helpful to introduce some
 intermediary variables. These are quantities that we aren't directly interested in, but
 seem important to the problem. For this problem, Anna's and Emanuel's distances
 from the starting point seem important. To notate these, we are going to define a
 coordinate system, putting the "starting point" at the intersection where they both
 started, then we're going to introduce a variable, A, to represent Anna's position, and
 define it to be a measurement from the starting point, in the eastward direction.
 Likewise, we'll introduce a variable, E, to represent Emanuel's position, measured from
 the starting point in the southward direction. Note that in defining the coordinate
 system we specified both the origin, or starting point, of the measurement, as well as the
 direction of measure.

 While we're at it, we'll define a third variable, D, to be the measurement of the distance
 between Anna and Emanuel. Showing the variables on the picture is often helpful.
 Looking at the variables on the picture, we remember we need to know how long it
 takes for D, the distance between them, to equal 2 miles.

                         E

                                                                    a  c

Seeing this picture we remember that in order to find the distance          b
between the two, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem, a              a2 + b2 = c2
property of right triangles.

From here, we can now look back at the problem for relevant information. Anna is
walking 4 miles per hour, and Emanuel is walking 3 miles per hour, which are rates of
change. Using those, we can write formulas for the distance each has walked.

They both start at the same intersection and so when t = 0, the distance travelled by each
person should also be 0, so given the rate for each, and the initial value for each, we get:

A(t) = 4t
E(t) = 3t

Using the Pythagorean theorem we get:           substitute in the function formulas
                                                solve for D(t) using the square root
D(t)2 = A(t)2 + E(t)2
D(t)2 = (4t)2 + (3t)2 =16t2 + 9t2 = 25t2
D(t) =  25t2 = 5 t

Since in this scenario we are only considering positive values of t and our distance D(t)
will always be positive, we can simplify this answer to D(t) = 5t

Interestingly, the distance between them is also a linear function. Using it, we can now
answer the question of when the distance between them will reach 2 miles:
D(t) = 2
5t = 2
t = 2 = 0.4

    5

They will fall out of radio contact in 0.4 hours, or 24 minutes.

Example 5

 There is currently a straight road leading from the town of Westborough to a town 30
 miles east and 10 miles north. Partway down this road, it junctions with a second road,
 perpendicular to the first, leading to the town of Eastborough. If the town of
 Eastborough is located 20 miles directly east of the town of Westborough, how far is the
 road junction from Westborough?

It might help here to draw a picture of        (0, 0)    20 miles     Other town
the situation. It would then be helpful to  Westborough                    (30, 10)
introduce a coordinate system. While we
could place the origin anywhere, placing                           (20, 0)
it at Westborough seems convenient.                                Eastborough
This puts the other town at coordinates
(30, 10), and Eastborough at (20, 0).

Using this point along with the origin, we can find the slope of the line from
Westborough to the other town: m = 10 - 0 = 1 . This gives the equation of the road

                                               30 - 0 3
from Westborough to the other town to be W (x) = 1 x .

                                                               3

From this, we can determine the perpendicular road to Eastborough will have slope
m = -3 . Since the town of Eastborough is at the point (20, 0), we can find the equation:

E(x) = -3x + b   plug in the point (20, 0)

0 = -3(20) + b

b = 60
E(x) = -3x + 60

We can now find the coordinates of the junction of the roads by finding the intersection
of these lines. Setting them equal,
1 x = -3x + 60
3

10 x = 60        Substituting this back into W(x)
 3
10x =180
x = 18

y = W (18) = 1 (18) = 6
                3

The roads intersect at the point (18, 6). Using the distance formula, we can now find
the distance from Westborough to the junction:

dist = (18 - 0)2 + (6 - 0)2  18.934 miles.

Section 2.4 Fitting Linear Models to Data

In the real world, rarely do things follow trends perfectly. When we expect the trend to
behave linearly, or when inspection suggests the trend is behaving linearly, it is often
desirable to find an equation to approximate the data. Finding an equation to approximate
the data helps us understand the behavior of the data and allows us to use the linear
model to make predictions about the data, inside and outside of the data range.

Example 1
 The table below shows the number of cricket chirps in 15 seconds, and the air
 temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit4. Plot this data, and determine whether the data
 appears to be linearly related.

         chirps 44 35 20.4 33 31 35 18.5 37 26
         Temp 80.5 70.5 57 66 68 72 52 73.5 53

 Plotting this data, it appears there may be a trend, and that the trend appears roughly
 linear, though certainly not perfectly so.

                         90

Temperature (degrees F)  80

                         70

                         60

                         50

                         40

                             10  20  30  40                    50

                                 Cricket Chirps in 15 seconds

The simplest way to find an equation to approximate this data is to try to "eyeball" a line
that seems to fit the data pretty well, then find an equation for that line based on the slope
and intercept.

You can see from the trend in the data that the number of chirps increases as the
temperature increases. As you consider a function for this data you should know that you
are looking at an increasing function or a function with a positive slope.

1. a. What descriptive variables would you choose to represent Temperature & Chirps?

   b. Which variable is the independent variable and which is the dependent variable?
   c. Based on this data and the graph, what is a reasonable domain & range?
   d. Based on the data alone, is this function one-to-one, explain?

Example 2
 Using the table of values from the previous example, find a linear function that fits the
 data by "eyeballing" a line that seems to fit.

On a graph, we could try sketching in a line.

Note the scale on the axes have been adjusted 90

to start at zero to include the vertical axis and 80

vertical intercept in the graph.                    70

Using the starting and ending points of our         50

"hand drawn" line, points (0, 30) and (50, 90), 40

this graph has a slope of m = = 1.2 and a           20
                                  50
vertical intercept at 30, giving an equation of 10
                                                    0

where c is the number of chirps in 15 seconds,
and T(c) is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

This linear equation can then be used to approximate the solution to various questions we
might ask about the trend. While the data does not perfectly fall on the linear equation,
the equation is our best guess as to how the relationship will behave outside of the values
we have data for. There is a difference, though, between making predictions inside the
domain and range of values we have data for, and outside that domain and range.

Interpolation and Extrapolation
Interpolation: When we predict a value inside the domain and range of the data
Extrapolation: When we predict a value outside the domain and range of the data

For the Temperature as a function of chirps in our hand drawn model above,
     Interpolation would occur if we used our model to predict temperature when the
         values for chirps are between 18.5 and 44.
     Extrapolation would occur if we used our model to predict temperature when the
         values for chirps are less than 18.5 or greater than 44.
                                                 Section 2.4 Fitting Linear Models to Data 143

Example 3
 a) Would predicting the temperature when crickets are chirping 30 times in 15 seconds
 be interpolation or extrapolation? Make the prediction, and discuss if it is reasonable.

 b) Would predicting the number of chirps crickets will make at 40 degrees be
 interpolation or extrapolation? Make the prediction, and discuss if it is reasonable.

 With our cricket data, our number of chirps in the data provided varied from 18.5 to 44.
 A prediction at 30 chirps per 15 seconds is inside the domain of our data, so would be
 interpolation. Using our model:
  T (30) = 30 +1.2(30) = 66 degrees.

 Based on the data we have, this value seems reasonable.

 The temperature values varied from 52 to 80.5. Predicting the number of chirps at 40
 degrees is extrapolation since 40 is outside the range of our data. Using our model:
  40 = 30 +1.2c
 10 = 1.2c
  c  8.33

 Our model predicts the crickets would chirp 8.33 times in 15 seconds. While this might
 be possible, we have no reason to believe our model is valid outside the domain and
 range. In fact, generally crickets stop chirping altogether below around 50 degrees.

When our model no longer applies after some point, it is sometimes called model
breakdown.

Fitting Lines with Technology

While eyeballing a line works reasonably well, there are statistical techniques for fitting a
line to data that minimize the differences between the line and data values5. This
technique is called least-square regression, and can be computed by many graphing
calculators, spreadsheet software like Excel or Google Docs, statistical software, and
many web-based calculators.

5 Technically, the method minimizes the sum of the squared differences in the vertical direction between
the line and the data values.
144 Chapter 2

Example 4
 Find the least-squares regression line using the cricket chirp data from above.

Using the cricket chirp data from earlier,     90     10            20  30        40  50
with technology we obtain the equation:        80
T (c) = 30.281+1.143c                          70
                                               60
Notice that this line is quite similar to the  50
equation we "eyeballed", but should fit the    40
data better. Notice also that using this       30
equation would change our prediction for       20
the temperature when hearing 30 chirps in      10
15 seconds from 66 degrees to:
T (30) = 30.281+1.143(30) = 64.571  64.6        0
degrees.                                           0

Most calculators and computer software will also provide you with the correlation
coefficient, a measure of how closely the line fits the data.

Correlation Coefficient
The correlation coefficient is a value, r, between -1 and 1.
r > 0 suggests a positive (increasing) relationship
r < 0 suggests a negative (decreasing) relationship
The closer the value is to 0, the more scattered the data
The closer the value is to 1 or -1, the less scattered the data is

The correlation coefficient provides an easy way to get some idea of how close to a line
the data falls.

We should only compute the correlation coefficient for data that follows a linear pattern;
if the data exhibits a non-linear pattern, the correlation coefficient is meaningless. To get
a sense for the relationship between the value of r and the graph of the data, here are
some large data sets with their correlation coefficients:
                                                 Section 2.4 Fitting Linear Models to Data 145

Example 5
 Calculate the correlation coefficient for our cricket data.

 Because the data appears to follow a linear pattern, we can use technology to calculate
 r = 0.9509. Since this value is very close to 1, it suggests a strong increasing linear
 relationship.

Section 2.5 Absolute Value Functions

So far in this chapter we have been studying the behavior of linear functions. The
Absolute Value Function is a piecewise-defined function made up of two linear
functions. The name, Absolute Value Function, should be familiar to you from
Section 1.2. In its basic form f (x) = x it is one of our toolkit functions.

 Absolute Value Function
 The absolute value function can be defined as

                 x if x  0
  f (x) = x = 

                -x if x  0

The absolute value function is commonly used to determine the distance between
two numbers on the number line. Given two values a and b, then a - b will give
the distance, a positive quantity, between these values, regardless of which value is
larger.

Example 1
 Describe all values, x, within a distance of 4 from the number 5.

 We want the distance between x and 5 to be less than or equal to 4. The distance can be
 represented using the absolute value, giving the expression
  x-5 4

Example 2
 A 2010 poll reported 78% of Americans believe that people who are gay should be able
 to serve in the US military, with a reported margin of error of 3%8. The margin of error
 tells us how far off the actual value could be from the survey value9. Express the set of
 possible values using absolute values.

 Since we want the size of the difference between the actual percentage, p, and the
 reported percentage to be less than 3%,
   p - 78  3

8 http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm, retrieved August 4, 2010
9 Technically, margin of error usually means that the surveyors are 95% confident that actual value falls
within this range.

Important Features

The most significant feature of the absolute value graph is the corner point where the
graph changes direction. When finding the equation for a transformed absolute
value function, this point is very helpful for determining the horizontal and vertical
shifts.

Example 3
 Write an equation for the function graphed.

 The basic absolute value function changes direction at
 the origin, so this graph has been shifted to the right 3
 and down 2 from the basic toolkit function.

 We might also notice that the graph appears stretched,
 since the linear portions have slopes of 2 and -2.
 From this information we could write the write the
 equation in two ways:

  f (x) = 2 x - 3 - 2 , treating the stretch as a vertical stretch
  f (x) = 2(x - 3) - 2 , treating the stretch as a horizontal compression

Note that these equations are algebraically equivalent - the stretch for an absolute value
function can be written interchangeably as a vertical or horizontal stretch/compression.

If you had not been able to determine the stretch based on the slopes of the lines, you

can solve for the stretch factor by putting in a known pair of values for x and f(x)

f (x) = a x - 3 - 2  Now substituting in the point (1, 2)

2 = a1-3 - 2

4 = 2a

a=2

2. Given the description of the transformed absolute value function write the equation.

   The absolute value function is horizontally shifted left 2 units, is vertically flipped, and
   vertically shifted up 3 units.
                                       Section 2.5 Absolute Value Functions 151

The graph of an absolute value function will have a vertical intercept when the input
is zero. The graph may or may not have horizontal intercepts, depending on how the
graph has been shifted and reflected. It is possible for the absolute value function to
have zero, one, or two horizontal intercepts.

Zero horizontal intercepts        One                               Two

To find the horizontal intercepts, we will need to solve an equation involving an
absolute value.

Notice that the absolute value function is not one-to-one, so typically inverses of
absolute value functions are not discussed.

Solving Absolute Value Equations

To solve an equation like 8 = 2x - 6 , we can notice that the absolute value will be

equal to eight if the quantity inside the absolute value were 8 or -8. This leads to

two different equations we can solve independently:

2x - 6 = 8 or 2x - 6 = -8

2x = 14  2x = -2

x=7      x = -1

Solutions to Absolute Value Equations
An equation of the form A = B , with B  0 , will have solutions when
A = B or A = -B

Example 4
 Find the horizontal intercepts of the graph of f (x) = 4x + 1 - 7

 The horizontal intercepts will occur when f (x) = 0 . Solving,
152 Chapter 2

0 = 4x +1 - 7  Isolate the absolute value on one side of the equation
7 = 4x +1      Now we can break this into two separate equations:

7 = 4x +1      - 7 = 4x +1
               -8 = 4x
6 = 4x     or  x = - 8 = -2

x= 6 = 3             4
     42

The graph has two horizontal intercepts, at x = 3 and x = -2
                                                           2

Example 5
 Solve 1 = 4 x - 2 + 2

 Isolating the absolute value on one side the equation,
  1=4x-2 +2
  -1= 4 x - 2
  -1 = x-2

    4

 At this point, we notice that this equation has no solutions - the absolute value always
 returns a positive value, so it is impossible for the absolute value to equal a negative
 value.

3. Find the horizontal & vertical intercepts for the function f (x) = - x + 2 + 3

Solving Absolute Value Inequalities

When absolute value inequalities are written to describe a set of values, like the
inequality x - 5  4 we wrote earlier, it is sometimes desirable to express this set of
values without the absolute value, either using inequalities, or using interval
notation.

We will explore two approaches to solving absolute value inequalities:
    1) Using the graph
    2) Using test values
                              Section 2.5 Absolute Value Functions 153

Example 6
 Solve x - 5  4

With both approaches, we will need to know first where the corresponding equality is
true. In this case, we first will find where x - 5 = 4 . We do this because the absolute

value is a nice friendly function with no breaks, so the only way the function values can
switch from being less than 4 to being greater than 4 is by passing through where the
values equal 4. Solve x - 5 = 4 ,

x - 5 = 4 or      x - 5 = -4
x=9               x =1

To use a graph, we can sketch the function f (x) = x - 5 . To help us see where the
outputs are 4, the line g(x) = 4 could also be sketched.

On the graph, we can see that indeed the output
values of the absolute value are equal to 4 at x = 1
and x = 9. Based on the shape of the graph, we
can determine the absolute value is less than or
equal to 4 between these two points, when
1  x  9. In interval notation, this would be the
interval [1,9].

As an alternative to graphing, after determining
that the absolute value is equal to 4 at x = 1 and x
= 9, we know the graph can only change from
being less than 4 to greater than 4 at these values. This divides the number line up into
three intervals: x<1, 1<x<9, and x>9. To determine when the function is less than 4, we
could pick a value in each interval and see if the output is less than or greater than 4.

Interval  Test x  f(x)        <4 or >4?
x<1       0       0-5 =5      greater
1<x<9     6       6-5 =1      less
x>9       11      11 - 5 = 6  greater

Since 1  x  9 is the only interval in which the output at the test value is less than 4,
we can conclude the solution to x - 5  4 is 1  x  9 .
154 Chapter 2

Example 7
 Given the function f (x) = - 1 4x - 5 + 3 , determine for what x values the function
                                      2
 values are negative.

We are trying to determine where f(x) < 0, which is when - 1 4x - 5 + 3  0 . We begin
                                                                           2

by isolating the absolute value:

- 1 4x - 5  -3     when we multiply both sides by -2, it reverses the inequality
  2

4x - 5  6

Next we solve for the equality 4x - 5 = 6

4x - 5 = 6         4x - 5 = -6

4x = 11 or 4x = -1

x = 11             x = -1
     4                  4

We can now either pick test values or sketch a graph of the function to determine on

which intervals the original function value are negative. Notice that it is not even really

important exactly what the graph looks like, as long as we know that it crosses the

horizontal axis at x = -1 and x = 11 , and that the graph has been reflected vertically.
                   4              4

From the graph of the function, we can see the
function values are negative to the left of the first
horizontal intercept at x = -1 , and negative to the

                                  4
right of the second intercept at x = 11 . This gives

                                            4
us the solution to the inequality:

x  -1 or x  11
4               4

                                           -1 11 
In interval notation, this would be  - ,    ,

A square is cut out of cardboard, with each side having length L. If we wanted to write a

function for the area of the square, with L as the input and the area as output, you may

recall that the area of a rectangle can be found by multiplying the length times the width.

Since our shape is a square, the length & the width are the same, giving the formula:

A(L)    =  L    L  =    2

                      L

Likewise, if we wanted a function for the volume of a cube with each side having some

length L, you may recall volume of a rectangular box can be found by multiplying length

by width by height, which are all equal for a cube, giving the formula:

V  (L)  =  L    L    L  =    3

                           L

These two functions are examples of power functions, functions that are some power of
the variable.

Power Function
A power function is a function that can be represented in the form
 f (x) = x p
Where the base is a variable and the exponent, p, is a number.

Example 1
 Which of our toolkit functions are power functions?

 The constant and identity functions are power functions, since they can be written as
  f (x) = x0 and f (x) = x1 respectively.

 The quadratic and cubic functions are both power functions with whole number powers:
  f (x) = x2 and f (x) = x3 .

 The reciprocal and reciprocal squared functions are both power functions with negative
 whole number powers since they can be written as f (x) = x-1 and f (x) = x-2 .

 The square and cube root functions are both power functions with fractional powers
 since they can be written as f (x) = x1 2 or f (x) = x1 3 .

1. What point(s) do the toolkit power functions have in common?

Characteristics of Power Functions

Shown to the right are the graphs of
f (x) = x2 , f (x) = x4 , and f (x) = x6 , all even whole number
powers. Notice that all these graphs have a fairly similar
shape, very similar to the quadratic toolkit, but as the power
increases the graphs flatten somewhat near the origin, and
become steeper away from the origin.

To describe the behavior as numbers become larger and

larger, we use the idea of infinity. The symbol for positive infinity is , and -  for

negative infinity. When we say that "x approaches infinity", which can be symbolically
written as x   , we are describing a behavior - we are saying that x is getting large in
the positive direction.

With the even power functions, as the x becomes large in either the positive or negative
direction, the output values become very large positive numbers. Equivalently, we could
describe this by saying that as x approaches positive or negative infinity, the f(x) values
approach positive infinity. In symbolic form, we could write: as x  , f (x)   .

Shown here are the graphs of
 f (x) = x3 , f (x) = x5 , and f (x) = x7 , all odd whole number
powers. Notice all these graphs look similar to the cubic
toolkit, but again as the power increases the graphs flatten
near the origin and become steeper away from the origin.

For these odd power functions, as x approaches negative
infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. As x approaches
positive infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity. In
symbolic form we write: as x  - , f (x)  - and as x   , f (x)   .

 Long Run Behavior
 The behavior of the graph of a function as the input takes on large negative values,
  x  - , and large positive values, x   , is referred to as the long run behavior of
 the function.

Example 2
 Describe the long run behavior of the graph of f (x) = x8 .

 Since f (x) = x8 has a whole, even power, we would expect this function to behave
 somewhat like the quadratic function. As the input gets large positive or negative, we
 would expect the output to grow without bound in the positive direction. In symbolic
 form, as x  , f (x)   .

Example 3
 Describe the long run behavior of the graph of f (x) = -x9

 Since this function has a whole odd power, we would expect it to behave somewhat like
 the cubic function. The negative in front of the x9 will cause a vertical reflection, so as
 the inputs grow large positive, the outputs will grow large in the negative direction, and
 as the inputs grow large negative, the outputs will grow large in the positive direction.

 In symbolic form, for the long run behavior we would write: as x   , f (x)  -
 and as x  - , f (x)   .

 You may use words or symbols to describe the long run behavior of these functions.

Polynomials

An oil pipeline bursts in the Gulf of Mexico, causing an oil slick in a roughly circular
shape. The slick is currently 24 miles in radius, but that radius is increasing by 8 miles
each week. If we wanted to write a formula for the area covered by the oil slick, we
could do so by composing two functions together. The first is a formula for the radius, r,
of the spill, which depends on the number of weeks, w, that have passed.
162 Chapter 3

Hopefully you recognized that this relationship is linear:
r(w) = 24 + 8w

We can combine this with the formula for the area, A, of a circle:
A(r) = r 2

Composing these functions gives a formula for the area in terms of weeks:
A(w) = A(r(w)) = A(24 + 8w) =  (24 + 8w)2

Multiplying this out gives the formula
A(w) = 576 + 384w + 64w2

This formula is an example of a polynomial. A polynomial is simply the sum of terms
each consisting of a vertically stretched or compressed power function with non-negative
whole number power.

 Terminology of Polynomial Functions
 A polynomial is function that can be written as f (x) = a0 + a1x + a2 x2 +  + an xn

 Each of the ai constants are called coefficients and can be positive, negative, or zero,
 and be whole numbers, decimals, or fractions.

 A term of the polynomial is any one piece of the sum, that is any ai xi . Each
 individual term is a transformed power function.

 The degree of the polynomial is the highest power of the variable that occurs in the
 polynomial.

 The leading term is the term containing the highest power of the variable: the term
 with the highest degree.

 The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the leading term.

 Because of the definition of the "leading" term we often rearrange polynomials so that
 the powers are descending.
  f (x) = an x n + ..... + a2 x 2 + a1x + a0
3.1 Power and Polynomial Functions 163

Example 4
 Identify the degree, leading term, and leading coefficient of these polynomials:

a) f (x) = 3 + 2x2 - 4x3 b) g(t) = 5t 5 - 2t 3 + 7t  c) h( p) = 6 p - p3 - 2

a) For the function f(x), the degree is 3, the highest power on x. The leading term is the
term containing that power, - 4x3 . The leading coefficient is the coefficient of that
term, -4.

b) For g(t), the degree is 5, the leading term is 5t 5 , and the leading coefficient is 5.

c) For h(p), the degree is 3, the leading term is - p3 , so the leading coefficient is -1.

 Long Run Behavior of Polynomials
 For any polynomial, the long run behavior of the polynomial will match the long run
 behavior of the leading term.

Example 5
 What can we determine about the long run behavior and
 degree of the equation for the polynomial graphed here?

 Since the output grows large and positive as the inputs
 grow large and positive, we describe the long run

 behavior symbolically by writing: as x   , f (x)  
 . Similarly, as x  - , f (x)  - .

 In words, we could say that as x values approach
 infinity, the function values approach infinity, and as x
 values approach negative infinity the function values
 approach negative infinity.

 We can tell this graph has the shape of an odd degree power function which has not
 been reflected, so the degree of the polynomial creating this graph must be odd, and the
 leading coefficient would be positive.

Short Run Behavior

Characteristics of the graph such as vertical and horizontal intercepts and the places the
graph changes direction are part of the short run behavior of the polynomial.

Like with all functions, the vertical intercept is where the graph crosses the vertical axis,
and occurs when the input value is zero. Since a polynomial is a function, there can only
be one vertical intercept, which occurs at the point (0, a0 ) . The horizontal intercepts
occur at the input values that correspond with an output value of zero. It is possible to
have more than one horizontal intercept.

Horizontal intercepts are also called zeros, or roots of the function.

Example 6
 Given the polynomial function f (x) = (x - 2)(x + 1)(x - 4) , written in factored form for
 your convenience, determine the vertical and horizontal intercepts.

 The vertical intercept occurs when the input is zero.
  f (0) = (0 - 2)(0 + 1)(0 - 4) = 8 .

 The graph crosses the vertical axis at the point (0, 8).

 The horizontal intercepts occur when the output is zero.
  0 = (x - 2)(x + 1)(x - 4) when x = 2, -1, or 4.
 f(x) has zeros, or roots, at x = 2, -1, and 4.

 The graph crosses the horizontal axis at the points (2, 0), (-1, 0), and (4, 0)

Notice that the polynomial in the previous example, which would be degree three if
multiplied out, had three horizontal intercepts and two turning points - places where the
graph changes direction. We will now make a general statement without justifying it -
the reasons will become clear later in this chapter.

 Intercepts and Turning Points of Polynomials
 A polynomial of degree n will have:
 At most n horizontal intercepts. An odd degree polynomial will always have at least
 one.
 At most n-1 turning points

Example 7
 What can we conclude about the graph of the
 polynomial shown here?

 Based on the long run behavior, with the graph
 becoming large positive on both ends of the graph, we
 can determine that this is the graph of an even degree
 polynomial. The graph has 2 horizontal intercepts,
 suggesting a degree of 2 or greater, and 3 turning points,
 suggesting a degree of 4 or greater. Based on this, it
 would be reasonable to conclude that the degree is even
 and at least 4, so it is probably a fourth degree
 polynomial.

Section 3.2 Quadratic Functions

In this section, we will explore the family of 2nd degree polynomials, the quadratic
functions. While they share many characteristics of polynomials in general, the
calculations involved in working with quadratics is typically a little simpler, which makes
them a good place to start our exploration of short run behavior. In addition, quadratics
commonly arise from problems involving area and projectile motion, providing some
interesting applications.

Example 1

 A backyard farmer wants to enclose a rectangular space for a new garden. She has
 purchased 80 feet of wire fencing to enclose 3 sides, and will put the 4th side against the
 backyard fence. Find a formula for the area enclosed by the fence if the sides of fencing
 perpendicular to the existing fence have length L.

In a scenario like this involving geometry, it is often   Garden L
                                                            W
helpful to draw a picture. It might also be helpful to

introduce a temporary variable, W, to represent the side
of fencing parallel to the 4th side or backyard fence.

Since we know we only have 80 feet of fence available,    Backyard

we know that L +W + L = 80 , or more simply,

2L +W = 80 . This allows us to represent the width, W, in terms of L: W = 80 - 2L

Now we are ready to write an equation for the area the fence encloses. We know the

area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, so
A = LW = L(80 - 2L)

A(L)  =  80 L  -        2

                  2L

This formula represents the area of the fence in terms of the variable length L.

Short run Behavior: Vertex

We now explore the interesting features of the graphs of quadratics. In addition to
intercepts, quadratics have an interesting feature where they change direction, called the
vertex. You probably noticed that all quadratics are related to transformations of the
basic quadratic function f (x) = x2 .
168 Chapter 3

Example 2
 Write an equation for the quadratic graphed below as a transformation of f (x) = x2 ,
 then expand the formula and simplify terms to write the equation in standard
 polynomial form.

 We can see the graph is the basic quadratic shifted to the left 2 and down 3, giving a
 formula in the form g(x) = a(x + 2)2 - 3 . By plugging in a point that falls on the grid,
 such as (0,-1), we can solve for the stretch factor:
  -1 = a(0 + 2)2 - 3
  2 = 4a
  a=1

       2
 Written as a transformation, the equation for this formula is g(x) = 1 (x + 2)2 - 3 . To

                                                                                    2
 write this in standard polynomial form, we can expand the formula and simplify terms:
  g(x) = 1 (x + 2)2 - 3

           2
  g(x) = 1 (x + 2)(x + 2) - 3

           2
  g(x) = 1 (x2 + 4x + 4) - 3

           2
  g(x) = 1 x2 + 2x + 2 - 3

           2
  g(x) = 1 x2 + 2x -1

           2

Notice that the horizontal and vertical shifts of the basic quadratic determine the location
of the vertex of the parabola; the vertex is unaffected by stretches and compressions.

Forms of Quadratic Functions

The standard form of a quadratic function is f (x) = ax2 + bx + c

The transformation form of a quadratic function is f (x) = a(x - h)2 + k

The vertex of the quadratic function is located at (h, k), where h and k are the numbers
in the transformation form of the function. Because the vertex appears in the
transformation form, it is often called the vertex form.

In the previous example, we saw that it is possible to rewrite a quadratic function given in
transformation form and rewrite it in standard form by expanding the formula. It would
be useful to reverse this process, since the transformation form reveals the vertex.

Expanding out the general transformation form of a quadratic gives:
 f (x) = a(x - h)2 + k = a(x - h)(x - h) + k
 f (x) = a(x2 - 2xh + h2 ) + k = ax2 - 2ahx + ah2 + k

This should be equal to the standard form of the quadratic:
ax2 - 2ahx + ah2 + k = ax2 + bx + c

The second degree terms are already equal. For the linear terms to be equal, the
coefficients must be equal:
- 2ah = b , so h = - b

                        2a

This provides us a method to determine the horizontal shift of the quadratic from the

standard form. We could likewise set the constant terms equal to find:

2 2  b 2 b2 b2
ah + k = c , so k = c - ah = c - a -  = c - a 2 = c -
 2a                                               4a         4a

170 Chapter 3

In practice, though, it is usually easier to remember that k is the output value of the
function when the input is h, so k = f (h) .

Finding the Vertex of a Quadratic

For a quadratic given in standard form, the vertex (h, k) is located at:

b               -b 
h = - , k = f (h) = f  
2a              2a 

Example 3
 Find the vertex of the quadratic f (x) = 2x2 - 6x + 7 . Rewrite the quadratic into
 transformation form (vertex form).

The horizontal coordinate of the vertex will be at h = - b = - - 6 = 6 = 3
                                                                       2a 2(2) 4 2

                                    3  32  3 5
The vertical coordinate of the vertex will be at f   = 2  - 6  + 7 =
                                   2 2 2                                            2

Rewriting into transformation form, the stretch factor will be the same as the a in the
original quadratic. Using the vertex to determine the shifts,

2. Given the equation g(x) = 13 + x2 - 6x write the equation in standard form and then in

   transformation/vertex form.

As an alternative to using a formula for finding the vertex, the equation can also be
written into vertex form by completing the square. This process is most easily
explained through example. In most cases, using the formula for finding the vertex will
be quicker and easier than completing the square, but completing the square is a useful
technique when faced with some other algebraic problems.

Example 4
 Rewrite f (x) = 2x2 -12x + 14 into vertex form by completing the square.

 We start by factoring the leading coefficient from the quadratic and linear terms.

 2(x2 - 6x)+14
                                                                     3.2 Quadratic Functions 171

Next, we are going to add something inside the parentheses so that the quadratic inside
the parentheses becomes a perfect square. In other words, we are looking for values p

and q so that (x2 - 6x + p)= (x - q)2 .

Notice that if multiplied out on the right, the middle term would be -2q, so q must be
half of the middle term on the left; q = -3. In that case, p must be (-3)2 = 9.

(x2 - 6x + 9)= (x - 3)2

Now, we can't just add 9 into the expression - that would change the value of the
expression. In fact, adding 9 inside the parentheses actually adds 18 to the expression,
since the 2 outside the parentheses will distribute. To keep the expression balanced, we
can subtract 18.

2(x2 - 6x + 9)+ 14 -18

Simplifying, we are left with vertex form.

2(x - 3)2 - 4

In addition to enabling us to more easily graph a quadratic written in standard form,
finding the vertex serves another important purpose - it allows us to determine the
maximum or minimum value of the function, depending on which way the graph opens.

Example 5
 Returning to our backyard farmer from the beginning of the section, what dimensions
 should she make her garden to maximize the enclosed area?

Earlier we determined the area she could enclose with 80 feet of fencing on three sides

was given by the equation  A(L)  =  80  L  -       2  .  Notice that quadratic has been vertically

                                              2L

reflected, since the coefficient on the squared term is negative, so the graph will open

downwards, and the vertex will be a maximum value for the area.

In finding the vertex, we take care since the equation is not written in standard
polynomial form with decreasing powers. But we know that a is the coefficient on the
squared term, so a = -2, b = 80, and c = 0.
Finding the vertex:
h = - 80 = 20 , k = A(20) = 80(20) - 2(20)2 = 800

        2(-2)

The maximum value of the function is an area of 800 square feet, which occurs when L
= 20 feet. When the shorter sides are 20 feet, that leaves 40 feet of fencing for the
longer side. To maximize the area, she should enclose the garden so the two shorter
sides have length 20 feet, and the longer side parallel to the existing fence has length 40
feet.
172 Chapter 3

Example 6

 A local newspaper currently has 84,000 subscribers, at a quarterly charge of $30.
 Market research has suggested that if they raised the price to $32, they would lose 5,000
 subscribers. Assuming that subscriptions are linearly related to the price, what price
 should the newspaper charge for a quarterly subscription to maximize their revenue?

Revenue is the amount of money a company brings in. In this case, the revenue can be
found by multiplying the charge per subscription times the number of subscribers. We
can introduce variables, C for charge per subscription and S for the number subscribers,
giving us the equation
Revenue = CS

Since the number of subscribers changes with the price, we need to find a relationship

between the variables. We know that currently S = 84,000 and C = 30, and that if they

raise the price to $32 they would lose 5,000 subscribers, giving a second pair of values,

C = 32 and S = 79,000. From this we can find a linear equation relating the two

quantities. Treating C as the input and S as the output, the equation will have form

S = mC + b . The slope will be

m = 79,000 - 84,000 = - 5,000 = -2,500
32 - 30                  2

This tells us the paper will lose 2,500 subscribers for each dollar they raise the price.
We can then solve for the vertical intercept

S = -2500C + b                          Plug in the point S = 84,000 and C = 30
84,000 = -2500 (30) + b                 Solve for b
b = 159,000

This gives us the linear equation S = -2,500C +159,000 relating cost and subscribers.
We now return to our revenue equation.

Revenue = CS                            Substituting the equation for S from above
Revenue = C(-2,500C +159,000)           Expanding
Revenue = -2,500C2 +159,000C

We now have a quadratic equation for revenue as a function of the subscription charge.
To find the price that will maximize revenue for the newspaper, we can find the vertex:
h = - 159,000 = 31.8

       2(-2,500 )

The model tells us that the maximum revenue will occur if the newspaper charges
$31.80 for a subscription. To find what the maximum revenue is, we can evaluate the
revenue equation:
Maximum Revenue = - 2,500(31.8)2 + 159,000(31.8) = $2,528,100

Short run Behavior: Intercepts

As with any function, we can find the vertical intercepts of a quadratic by evaluating the
function at an input of zero, and we can find the horizontal intercepts by solving for when
the output will be zero. Notice that depending upon the location of the graph, we might
have zero, one, or two horizontal intercepts.

zero horizontal intercepts one horizontal intercept two horizontal intercepts

Example 7
 Find the vertical and horizontal intercepts of the quadratic f (x) = 3x2 + 5x - 2

We can find the vertical intercept by evaluating the function at an input of zero:

f (0) = 3(0)2 + 5(0) - 2 = -2  Vertical intercept at (0,-2)

For the horizontal intercepts, we solve for when the output will be zero
0 = 3x2 + 5x - 2

In this case, the quadratic can be factored easily, providing the simplest method for

solution

0 = (3x -1)(x + 2)

0 = 3x -1           0= x+2                                  1 
x = 1 or            x = -2     Horizontal intercepts at  ,0 and (-2,0)

    3                                                       3 

Notice that in the standard form of a quadratic, the constant term c reveals the vertical
intercept of the graph.

Example 8
 Find the horizontal intercepts of the quadratic f (x) = 2x2 + 4x - 4

 Again we will solve for when the output will be zero
  0 = 2x2 + 4x - 4
174 Chapter 3

Since the quadratic is not easily factorable in this case, we solve for the intercepts by

first rewriting the quadratic into transformation form.

h = - b = - 4 = -1            k = f (-1) = 2(-1)2 + 4(-1) - 4 = -6
       2a 2(2)

f (x) = 2(x +1)2 - 6

Now we can solve for when the output will be zero
0 = 2(x + 1)2 - 6
6 = 2(x + 1)2
3 = (x + 1)2

x +1=  3

x = -1  3

The graph has horizontal intercepts at (-1 - 3,0) and (-1 + 3,0)

3. In Try it Now problem 2 we found the standard & transformation form for the function

    g(x) = 13 + x2 - 6x . Now find the Vertical & Horizontal intercepts (if any).

The process in the last example is done commonly enough that sometimes people find it

easier to solve the problem once in general and remember the formula for the result,

rather than repeating the process each time. Based on our previous work we showed that

any quadratic in standard form can be written into transformation form as:

     b 2 b2
f (x) = a x +  + c -
     2a                   4a

Solving for the horizontal intercepts using this general equation gives:

Example 9
 A ball is thrown upwards from the top of a 40-foot-tall building at a speed of 80 feet per
 second. The ball's height above ground can be modeled by the equation
  H (t) = -16t2 + 80t + 40 .

 What is the maximum height of the ball?
 When does the ball hit the ground?

To find the maximum height of the ball, we would need to know the vertex of the

quadratic.

          80 80 5                5   5 2  5 
  h=-           = = , k = H   = -16  + 80  + 40 = 140
       2(-16) 32 2              2        2 2

The ball reaches a maximum height of 140 feet after 2.5 seconds.

To find when the ball hits the ground, we need to determine when the height is zero -

when H(t) = 0. While we could do this using the transformation form of the quadratic,

we can also use the quadratic formula:

  t=  - 80  80 2 - 4(-16)(40) - 80  8960

Since the square root does not simplify nicely, we can use a calculator to approximate
the values of the solutions:

  t = - 80 - 8960  5.458 or     t = - 80 + 8960  -0.458
           - 32                          - 32

The second answer is outside the reasonable domain of our model, so we conclude the
ball will hit the ground after about 5.458 seconds.

Section 3.3 Graphs of Polynomial Functions

In the previous section, we explored the short run behavior of quadratics, a special case
of polynomials. In this section, we will explore the short run behavior of polynomials in
general.

Short run Behavior: Intercepts

As with any function, the vertical intercept can be found by evaluating the function at an
input of zero. Since this is evaluation, it is relatively easy to do it for a polynomial of any
degree.

To find horizontal intercepts, we need to solve for when the output will be zero. For
general polynomials, this can be a challenging prospect. While quadratics can be solved
using the relatively simple quadratic formula, the corresponding formulas for cubic and
4th degree polynomials are not simple enough to remember, and formulas do not exist for
general higher-degree polynomials. Consequently, we will limit ourselves to three cases:

           1) The polynomial can be factored using known methods: greatest common
               factor and trinomial factoring.

           2) The polynomial is given in factored form.
           3) Technology is used to determine the intercepts.

Other techniques for finding the intercepts of general polynomials will be explored in the
next section.

Example 1
 Find the horizontal intercepts of f (x) = x6 - 3x4 + 2x2 .

We can attempt to factor this polynomial to find solutions for f(x) = 0.

x6 - 3x4 + 2x2 = 0             Factoring out the greatest common factor
                               Factoring the inside as a quadratic in x2
x2 (x4 - 3x2 + 2) = 0

x2 (x2 -1)(x2 - 2) = 0         Then break apart to find solutions

x2 = 0                  (x2 -1) = 0      (x2 - 2) = 0
x=0
        or              x2 =1        or  x2 = 2

                        x = 1            x= 2

This gives us 5 horizontal intercepts.
182 Chapter 3

Example 2
 Find the vertical and horizontal intercepts of g(t) = (t - 2)2 (2t + 3)

The vertical intercept can be found by evaluating g(0).
g(0) = (0 - 2)2 (2(0) + 3) = 12

The horizontal intercepts can be found by solving g(t) = 0

(t - 2)2 (2t + 3) = 0                Since this is already factored, we can break it apart:

(t - 2)2 = 0           (2t + 3) = 0

t - 2 = 0 or           t = -3
t=2                         2

We can always check our answers are reasonable by graphing the polynomial.

Example 3
 Find the horizontal intercepts of h(t) = t 3 + 4t 2 + t - 6

 Since this polynomial is not in factored form, has no
 common factors, and does not appear to be factorable
 using techniques we know, we can turn to technology to
 find the intercepts.

 Graphing this function, it appears there are horizontal
 intercepts at t = -3, -2, and 1.

 We could check these are correct by plugging in these
 values for t and verifying that h(-3) = h(-2) = h(1) = 0 .

1. Find the vertical and horizontal intercepts of the function f (t) = t 4 - 4t 2 .

Graphical Behavior at Intercepts

If we graph the function f (x) = (x + 3)(x - 2)2 (x +1)3 ,
notice that the behavior at each of the horizontal
intercepts is different.

At the horizontal intercept x = -3, coming from the
(x + 3) factor of the polynomial, the graph passes
directly through the horizontal intercept.
                                                       3.3 Graphs of Polynomial Functions 183

The factor (x + 3) is linear (has a power of 1), so the behavior near the intercept is like
that of a line - it passes directly through the intercept. We call this a single zero, since the
zero corresponds to a single factor of the function.

At the horizontal intercept x = 2, coming from the (x - 2)2 factor of the polynomial, the
graph touches the axis at the intercept and changes direction. The factor is quadratic
(degree 2), so the behavior near the intercept is like that of a quadratic - it bounces off
the horizontal axis at the intercept. Since (x - 2)2 = (x - 2)(x - 2) , the factor is repeated
twice, so we call this a double zero. We could also say the zero has multiplicity 2.

At the horizontal intercept x = -1, coming from the (x +1)3 factor of the polynomial, the
graph passes through the axis at the intercept, but flattens out a bit first. This factor is
cubic (degree 3), so the behavior near the intercept is like that of a cubic, with the same
"S" type shape near the intercept that the toolkit x 3 has. We call this a triple zero. We
could also say the zero has multiplicity 3.

By utilizing these behaviors, we can sketch a reasonable graph of a factored polynomial
function without needing technology.

Graphical Behavior of Polynomials at Horizontal Intercepts

If a polynomial contains a factor of the form (x - h) p , the behavior near the horizontal

intercept h is determined by the power on the factor.

p = 1           p = 2                                       p = 3

Single zero     Double zero                            Triple zero
Multiplicity 1  Multiplicity 2                         Multiplicity 3

For higher even powers 4,6,8 etc.... the graph will still bounce off the horizontal axis
but the graph will appear flatter with each increasing even power as it approaches and
leaves the axis.

For higher odd powers, 5,7,9 etc... the graph will still pass through the horizontal axis
but the graph will appear flatter with each increasing odd power as it approaches and
leaves the axis.
184 Chapter 3

Example 4
 Sketch a graph of f (x) = -2(x + 3)2 (x - 5) .

 This graph has two horizontal intercepts. At x = -3, the factor is squared, indicating the
 graph will bounce at this horizontal intercept. At x = 5, the factor is not squared,
 indicating the graph will pass through the axis at this intercept.

 Additionally, we can see the leading term, if this polynomial were multiplied out, would
 be - 2x3 , so the long-run behavior is that of a vertically reflected cubic, with the
 outputs decreasing as the inputs get large positive, and the inputs increasing as the
 inputs get large negative.

 To sketch this we consider the following:

 As x  - the function f (x)   so we know the graph starts in the 2nd quadrant

 and is decreasing toward the horizontal axis.

 At (-3, 0) the graph bounces off the horizontal axis and so the function must start
 increasing.

 At (0, 90) the graph crosses the vertical axis at the vertical intercept.

 Somewhere after this point, the graph must turn back down or start decreasing toward
 the horizontal axis since the graph passes through the next intercept at (5,0).

 As x   the function f (x)  - so we know the

 graph continues to decrease and we can stop drawing
 the graph in the 4th quadrant.

 Using technology we can verify the shape of the
 graph.

Solving Polynomial Inequalities

One application of our ability to find intercepts and sketch a graph of polynomials is the
ability to solve polynomial inequalities. It is a very common question to ask when a
function will be positive and negative. We can solve polynomial inequalities by either
utilizing the graph, or by using test values.

Example 5
 Solve (x + 3)(x +1)2 (x - 4)  0

As with all inequalities, we start by solving the equality (x + 3)(x +1)2 (x - 4) = 0 ,

which has solutions at x = -3, -1, and 4. We know the function can only change from
positive to negative at these values, so these divide the inputs into 4 intervals.

We could choose a test value in each interval and evaluate the function
 f (x) = (x + 3)(x +1)2 (x - 4) at each test value to determine if the function is positive or

negative in that interval

Interval     Test x in interval         f( test value)  >0 or <0?
x < -3       -4                         72              > 0
-3 < x < -1  -2                         -6              < 0
-1 < x < 4   0                          -12             < 0
x > 4        5                          288             > 0

On a number line this would look like:  negative        0 positive
        positive 0 negative 0

 From our test values, we can determine this function is positive when x < -3 or x > 4, or
 in interval notation, (-,-3)  (4, )

We could have also determined on which intervals the function was positive by sketching
a graph of the function. We illustrate that technique in the next example
186 Chapter 3

Example 6
 Find the domain of the function v(t) = 6 - 5t - t 2 .

 A square root is only defined when the quantity we are taking the square root of, the
 quantity inside the square root, is zero or greater. Thus, the domain of this function will
 be when 6 - 5t - t 2  0 .

 We start by solving the equality 6 - 5t - t 2 = 0 . While we could use the quadratic
 formula, this equation factors nicely to (6 + t)(1 - t) = 0 , giving horizontal intercepts t =
 1 and t = -6.

 Sketching a graph of this quadratic will allow us to
 determine when it is positive.

 From the graph we can see this function is positive
 for inputs between the intercepts. So 6 - 5t - t 2  0
 for - 6  t  1, and this will be the domain of the v(t)
 function.

Writing Equations using Intercepts

Since a polynomial function written in factored form will have a horizontal intercept
where each factor is equal to zero, we can form a function that will pass through a set of
horizontal intercepts by introducing a corresponding set of factors.

 Writing an Equation for a Polynomial from Intercepts
 If we know the horizontal intercepts and the behavior or multiplicity at those
 intercepts, we can write a polynomial of minimal degree with those intercepts.

 1. Determine the horizontal intercepts x = x1, x2, , xk
 2. Examine the behavior at each intercept to determine the corresponding multiplicity

      of each intercept, p1, p2, , pk
 3. Write the polynomial in factored form f (x) = a(x - x1) p1 (x - x2 ) p2 (x - xk ) pk
 4. Use another point on the graph to solve for the stretch factor a

 Notice the degree of the polynomial will be the sum of the multiplicities pi .
                                                       3.3 Graphs of Polynomial Functions 187

Example 7
 Write a formula for the polynomial function
 graphed here.

 This graph has three horizontal intercepts: x = -3,
 2, and 5. At x = -3 and 5 the graph passes through
 the axis, suggesting the corresponding factors of
 the polynomial will be linear. At x = 2 the graph
 bounces at the intercept, suggesting the
 corresponding factor of the polynomial will be 2nd
 degree (quadratic).

 Together, this gives us:
  f (x) = a(x + 3)(x - 2)2 (x - 5)

 To determine the stretch factor, we can utilize another point on the graph. Here, the
 vertical intercept appears to be (0,-2), so we can plug in those values to solve for a:
  - 2 = a(0 + 3)(0 - 2)2 (0 - 5)
  - 2 = -60a
  a= 1

       30

 The graphed polynomial appears to represent the function
  f (x) = 1 (x + 3)(x - 2)2 (x - 5) .

Estimating Extrema
With quadratics, we were able to algebraically find the maximum or minimum value of
the function by finding the vertex. For general polynomials, finding these turning points
is not possible without more advanced techniques from calculus. Even then, finding
where extrema occur can still be algebraically challenging. For now, we will estimate the
locations of turning points using technology to generate a graph.

Example 8
 An open-top box is to be constructed by cutting out squares from each corner of a 14cm
 by 20cm sheet of plastic then folding up the sides. Find the size of squares that should
 be cut out to maximize the volume enclosed by the box.
                                                                                     w
 We will start this problem by drawing a picture, labeling the w
 width of the cut-out squares with a variable, w.
 Notice that after a square is cut out from each end, it leaves a
  (14 - 2w) cm by (120 - 2w) cm rectangle for the base of the
 box, and the box will be w cm tall. This gives the volume:
  V (w) = (14 - 2w)(20 - 2w)w = 280 w - 68w2 + 4w3
 Using technology to sketch a graph allows us to estimate the maximum value for the
 volume, restricted to reasonable values for w: values from 0 to 7.

 From this graph, we can estimate the maximum value is around 340, and occurs when
 the squares are about 2.75cm square. To improve this estimate, we could use advanced
 features of our technology, if available, or simply change our window to zoom in on our
 graph.

 From this zoomed-in view, we can refine our estimate for the max volume to about 339,
 when the squares are 2.7cm square.

Section 3.4 Factor Theorem and Remainder Theorem

In the last section, we limited ourselves to finding the intercepts, or zeros, of polynomials
that factored simply, or we turned to technology. In this section, we will look at
algebraic techniques for finding the zeros of polynomials like h(t) = t3 + 4t2 + t - 6 .

Long Division

In the last section we saw that we could write a polynomial as a product of factors, each
corresponding to a horizontal intercept. If we knew that x = 2 was an intercept of the
polynomial x 3 + 4x 2 - 5x -14 , we might guess that the polynomial could be factored as
x3 + 4x2 - 5x -14 = (x - 2)(something) . To find that "something," we can use
polynomial division.

Example 1
 Divide x3 + 4x2 - 5x -14 by x - 2

 Start by writing the problem out in long division form

  x - 2 x3 + 4x 2 -5x -14

Now we divide the leading terms: x3  x = x2 . It is best to align it above the same-
powered term in the dividend. Now, multiply that x2 by x - 2 and write the result
below the dividend.

               x2            Now subtract that expression from the dividend.
x - 2 x3 + 4x 2 -5x -14

      x3 - 2x2

                 x2
x - 2 x3 + 4x 2 -5x -14

    -(x3 - 2x2 )

               6x2 - 5x -14

Again, divide the leading term of the remainder by the leading term of the divisor.
6x2  x = 6x . We add this to the result, multiply 6x by x - 2 , and subtract.
                                 3.4 Factor Theorem and Remainder Theorem 195

                x2 + 6x          Repeat the process one last time.
x - 2 x3 + 4x 2 -5x -14

    -(x3 - 2x2 )

               6x2 - 5x -14

        -(6x2 -12x)

                     7x -14

                 x2 + 6x + 7
x - 2 x3 + 4x 2 -5x -14

    -(x3 - 2x2 )

               6x2 - 5x -14

        - (6x2 -12x)

                      7x -14

              -(7x -14)

                            0

This tells us x3 + 4x2 - 5x -14 divided by x - 2 is x2 + 6x + 7 , with a remainder of

zero. This also means that we can factor x3 + 4x2 - 5x -14 as ( x - 2)( x2 + 6x + 7) .

This gives us a way to find the intercepts of this polynomial.

Example 2
 Find the horizontal intercepts of h(x) = x3 + 4x2 - 5x -14 .

To find the horizontal intercepts, we need to solve h(x) = 0. From the previous

example, we know the function can be factored as h(x) = ( x - 2)( x2 + 6x + 7) .

h(x) = ( x - 2)( x2 + 6x + 7) = 0 when x = 2 or when x2 + 6x + 7 = 0 . This doesn't factor

nicely, but we could use the quadratic formula to find the remaining two zeros.

x=  -6  62 - 4(1)(7)  = -3  2 .

    2(1)

The horizontal intercepts will be at (2, 0) , (-3- 2,0) , and (-3+ 2,0) .

1. Divide 2x3 - 7x + 3 by x + 3 using long division.

The Factor and Remainder Theorems
When we divide a polynomial, p(x) by some divisor polynomial d(x), we will get a
quotient polynomial q(x) and possibly a remainder r(x). In other words,
p(x) = d(x)q(x) + r(x) .

Because of the division, the remainder will either be zero, or a polynomial of lower
degree than d(x). Because of this, if we divide a polynomial by a term of the form x - c ,
then the remainder will be zero or a constant.
If p(x) = (x - c)q(x) + r , then p(c) = (c - c)q(c) + r = 0 + r = r , which establishes the
Remainder Theorem.

 The Remainder Theorem
 If p(x) is a polynomial of degree 1 or greater and c is a real number, then when p(x)
 is divided by x - c , the remainder is p(c) .

If x - c is a factor of the polynomial p, then p(x) = (x - c)q(x) for some polynomial q.
Then p(c) = (c - c)q(c) = 0 , showing c is a zero of the polynomial. This shouldn't
surprise us - we already knew that if the polynomial factors it reveals the roots.
If p(c) = 0 , then the remainder theorem tells us that if p is divided by x - c , then the
remainder will be zero, which means x - c is a factor of p.

 The Factor Theorem
 If p(x) is a nonzero polynomial, then the real number c is a zero of p(x) if and only
 if x - c is a factor of p(x) .

Synthetic Division
Since dividing by x - c is a way to check if a number is a zero of the polynomial, it
would be nice to have a faster way to divide by x - c than having to use long division
every time. Happily, quicker ways have been discovered.
                                             3.4 Factor Theorem and Remainder Theorem 197

Let's look back at the long division we did in Example 1 and try to streamline it. First,
let's change all the subtractions into additions by distributing through the negatives.

                 x2 + 6x + 7
x - 2 x3 + 4x 2 -5x -14

       -x3 + 2x2
                6x2 - 5x -14

              - 6x2 +12x
                      7x -14

                    -7x +14
                            0

Next, observe that the terms -x3 , -6x2 , and -7x are the exact opposite of the terms
above them. The algorithm we use ensures this is always the case, so we can omit them
without losing any information. Also note that the terms we `bring down' (namely the
-5x and -14) aren't really necessary to recopy, so we omit them, too.

               x2 + 6x + 7
x - 2 x3 + 4x 2 -5x -14

              2x2
              6x2

                    12x
                      7x
                          14
                           0

Now, let's move things up a bit and, for reasons which will become clear in a moment,
copy the x3 into the last row.

               x2 + 6x + 7
x - 2 x3 + 4x 2 -5x -14

             2x2 12x 14
       x3 6x2 7x 0

Note that by arranging things in this manner, each term in the last row is obtained by
adding the two terms above it. Notice also that the quotient polynomial can be obtained
by dividing each of the first three terms in the last row by x and adding the results. If you
take the time to work back through the original division problem, you will find that this is
exactly the way we determined the quotient polynomial.
198 Chapter 3

This means that we no longer need to write the quotient polynomial down, nor the x in
the divisor, to determine our answer.

x - 2 x3 + 4x 2 -5x -14
             2x2 12x 14

       x3 6x2 7x 0

We've streamlined things quite a bit so far, but we can still do more. Let's take a
moment to remind ourselves where the 2x2 , 12x and 14 came from in the second row.
Each of these terms was obtained by multiplying the terms in the quotient, x2 , 6x and 7,
respectively, by the -2 in x - 2, then by -1 when we changed the subtraction to addition.
Multiplying by -2 then by -1 is the same as multiplying by 2, so we replace the -2 in the
divisor by 2. Furthermore, the coefficients of the quotient polynomial match the
coefficients of the first three terms in the last row, so we now take the plunge and write
only the coefficients of the terms to get

    2 1 4 -5 -14
                  2 12 14

           1 6 7 0

We have constructed a synthetic division tableau for this polynomial division problem.
Let's re-work our division problem using this tableau to see how it greatly streamlines the
division process. To divide x3 + 4x2 - 5x -14 by x - 2 , we write 2 in the place of the
divisor and the coefficients of x3 + 4x2 - 5x -14 in for the dividend. Then "bring down"
the first coefficient of the dividend.

2 1 4 -5 -14   2 1 4 -5 -14
                      
                      1

Next, take the 2 from the divisor and multiply by the 1 that was "brought down" to get 2.
Write this underneath the 4, then add to get 6.

2 1 4 -5 -14   2 1 4 -5 -14
        2              2
       1              1 6

Now take the 2 from the divisor times the 6 to get 12, and add it to the -5 to get 7.

2 1 4 -5 -14   2 1 4 -5 -14
        2 12           2 12
       1 6            1 6 7
                 3.4 Factor Theorem and Remainder Theorem 199

Finally, take the 2 in the divisor times the 7 to get 14, and add it to the -14 to get 0.

2 1 4 -5 -14     2 1 4 -5 -14
        2 12 14          2 12 14
       1 6 7            1 6 7 0

The first three numbers in the last row of our tableau are the coefficients of the quotient
polynomial. Remember, we started with a third degree polynomial and divided by a first
degree polynomial, so the quotient is a second degree polynomial. Hence the quotient is
x 2 + 6x + 7 . The number in the box is the remainder. Synthetic division is our tool of
choice for dividing polynomials by divisors of the form x - c. It is important to note that
it works only for these kinds of divisors. Also take note that when a polynomial (of
degree at least 1) is divided by x - c, the result will be a polynomial of exactly one less
degree. Finally, it is worth the time to trace each step in synthetic division back to its
corresponding step in long division.

Example 3
 Use synthetic division to divide 5x3 - 2x2 +1 by x - 3 .

 When setting up the synthetic division tableau, we need to enter 0 for the coefficient of
 x in the dividend. Doing so gives

        3 5 -2 0 1
                15 39 117
               5 13 39 118

 Since the dividend was a third degree polynomial, the quotient is a quadratic
 polynomial with coefficients 5, 13 and 39. Our quotient is q(x) = 5x2 +13x + 39 and
 the remainder is r(x) = 118. This means
  5x3 - 2x2 +1 = (x - 3)(5x2 +13x + 39) +118 .

 It also means that x - 3 is not a factor of 5x3 - 2x2 +1 .

Example 4
 Divide x3 + 8 by x + 2

 For this division, we rewrite x + 2 as x - (-2) and proceed as before.

       -2 1 0 0 8
                -2 4 -8
               1 -2 4 0
200 Chapter 3

 The quotient is x2 - 2x + 4 and the remainder is zero. Since the remainder is zero,
  x + 2 is a factor of x3 + 8 .

 x3 + 8 = (x + 2)( x2 - 2x + 4)

2. Divide 4x4 - 8x2 - 5x by x - 3 using synthetic division.

Using this process allows us to find the real zeros of polynomials, presuming we can
figure out at least one root. We'll explore how to do that in the next section.

Example 5
 The polynomial p(x) = 4x4 - 4x3 -11x2 +12x - 3 has a horizontal intercept at x = 1
                                                                                                       2
 with multiplicity 2. Find the other intercepts of p(x).

Since x = 1 is an intercept with multiplicity 2, then x - 1 is a factor twice. Use

From the first division, we get 4x - 4x -11x +12x - 3 =  x - (4x - 2x -12x - 6)432

44x - 4x -11x +12x - 3 =  x -  x -  (4x -12) .32

                               2 2

To find the remaining intercepts, we set 4x2 -12 = 0 and get x =  3 .

                                                  1 1
Note this also means 4x - 4x -11x +12x - 3 = 4 x -  x - ( x - 3)( x + 3 ) .432

Section 3.5 Real Zeros of Polynomials

In the last section, we saw how to determine if a real number
was a zero of a polynomial. In this section, we will learn how
to find good candidates to test using synthetic division. In the
days before graphing technology was commonplace,
mathematicians discovered a lot of clever tricks for determining
the likely locations of zeros. Technology has provided a much
simpler approach to narrow down potential candidates, but it is
not always sufficient by itself. For example, the function
shown to the right does not have any clear intercepts.

There are two results that can help us identify where the zeros of a polynomial are. The
first gives us an interval on which all the real zeros of a polynomial can be found.

Cauchy's Bound

Given a polynomial f (x) = an xn + an-1xn-1 + + a1x + a0 , let M be the largest of the
coefficients in absolute value. Then all the real zeros of f(x) lie in the interval

- M -1,  M
 an          +1

         an 

Example 1
 Let f (x) = 2x4 + 4x3 - x2 - 6x - 3. Determine an interval which contains all the real
 zeros of f.

To find the M from Cauchy's Bound, we take the absolute value of the coefficients and
pick the largest, in this case -6 = 6 . Divide this by the absolute value of the leading

coefficient, 2, to get 3. All the real zeros of f lie in the interval

- 6 -1,  6
 2
          +1 = -3 -1, 3 +1 = [-4, 4] .

         2 

Knowing this bound can be very helpful when using a graphing calculator, since we can
use it to set the display bounds. This helps avoid missing a zero because it is graphed
outside of the viewing window.

1. Determine an interval which contains all the real zeros of f (x) = 3x3 -12x2 + 6x - 8

Now that we know where we can find the real zeros, we still need a list of possible real
zeros. The Rational Roots Theorem provides us a list of potential integer and rational
zeros.

Rational Roots Theorem

Given a polynomial f (x) = an xn + an-1xn-1 + + a1x + a0 with integer coefficients, if r
is a rational zero of f, then r is of the form r =  p , where p is a factor of the constant

                                                          q
term a0 , and q is a factor of the leading coefficient, an .

This gives us a list of numbers to try in our synthetic division, which is a nicer place to
start than simply guessing. If none of the numbers in the list are zeros, then either the
polynomial has no real zeros at all, or all the real zeros are irrational numbers.

Example 2
 Let f (x) = 2x4 + 4x3 - x2 - 6x - 3. Use the Rational Roots Theorem to list all the
 possible rational zeros of f(x).

To generate a complete list of rational zeros, we need to take each of the factors of the

constant term, a0 = -3 , and divide them by each of the factors of the leading coefficient

a4 = 2 . The factors of -3 are 1 and 3. Since the Rational Roots Theorem tacks on a

 anyway, for the moment, we consider only the positive factors 1 and 3. The factors of

2 are 1 and 2, so the Rational Roots Theorem gives the list

 1 1 3 3  1  3
 ,  ,  ,   , or 1,  , 3,  
 1 2 1 2  2  2

Now we can use synthetic division to test these possible zeros. To narrow the list first,
we could use graphing technology to help us identify some good possibilities.
                                                               3.5 Real Zeros of Polynomials 205

Example 3
 Find the horizontal intercepts of f (x) = 2x4 + 4x3 - x2 - 6x - 3.
 From Example 1, we know that the real zeros lie in the interval [-4, 4]. Using a
 graphing calculator, we could set the window accordingly and get the graph below.

                    1  3
In Example 2, we learned that any rational zero must be on the list 1,  , 3,   .
                    2  2

From the graph, it looks like -1 is a good possibility, so we try that using synthetic

division.

-1 2 4 -1 -6 -3
        -2 -2 3 3
       2 2 -3 -3 0

Success! Remembering that f was a fourth degree polynomial, we know that our
quotient is a third degree polynomial. If we can do one more successful division, we
will have knocked the quotient down to a quadratic, and, if all else fails, we can use the
quadratic formula to find the last two zeros. Since there seems to be no other rational
zeros to try, we continue with -1. Also, the shape of the crossing at x = -1 leads us to
wonder if the zero x = -1 has multiplicity 3.

-1 2 2 -3 -3
         -2 0 3
        2 0 -3 0

Success again! Our quotient polynomial is now 2x2 - 3 . Setting this to zero gives

2x2 - 3 = 0 , giving x =  3 =  6 . Since a fourth degree polynomial can have at
                                22

most four zeros, including multiplicities, then the intercept x = -1 must only have
multiplicity 2, which we had found through division, and not 3 as we had guessed.
206 Chapter 3

It is interesting to note that we could greatly improve on the graph of y = f (x) in the
previous example given to us by the calculator. For instance, from our determination of
the zeros of f and their multiplicities, we know the graph crosses at x = - 6  -1.22

                                                                                           2
then turns back upwards to touch the x-axis at x = -1. This tells us that, despite what the
calculator showed us the first time, there is a relative maximum occurring at x = -1 and
not a "flattened crossing" as we originally believed.

After resizing the window, we see not only the relative maximum but also a relative
minimum just to the left of x = -1.

In this case, mathematics helped reveal something that was hidden in the initial graph.

Example 4
 Find the real zeros of f (x) = 4x3 -10x2 - 2x + 2 .

Cauchy's Bound tells us that the real zeros lie in the

 10 10 
interval - -1, +1 = [-3.5, 3.5].
 4  4 

Graphing on this interval reveals no clear integer
zeros. Turning to the rational roots theorem, we need
to take each of the factors of the constant term, a0 = 2
, and divide them by each of the factors of the leading
coefficient a3 = 4 . The factors of 2 are 1 and 2. The
factors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4, so the Rational Roots
Theorem gives the list

Section 3.6 Complex Zeros

When finding the zeros of polynomials, at some point you're faced with the problem
x2 = -1. While there are clearly no real numbers that are solutions to this equation,
leaving things there has a certain feel of incompleteness. To address that, we will need
utilize the imaginary unit, i.

Imaginary Number i

The most basic complex number is i, defined to be i = -1 , commonly called an
imaginary number. Any real multiple of i is also an imaginary number.

Example 1
 Simplify -9 .

We can separate -9 as    9 -1 . We can take the square root of 9, and write the
square root of -1 as i.

  -9 = 9 -1 = 3i

A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number.

Complex Number
A complex number is a number z = a + bi , where a and b are real numbers
a is the real part of the complex number
b is the imaginary part of the complex number

i = -1

Arithmetic on Complex Numbers

Before we dive into the more complicated uses of complex numbers, let's make sure we
remember the basic arithmetic involved. To add or subtract complex numbers, we simply
add the like terms, combining the real parts and combining the imaginary parts.
                                                                            3.6 Complex Zeros 211

Example 3
 Add 3 - 4i and 2 + 5i .

 Adding (3 - 4i) + (2 + 5i) , we add the real parts and the imaginary parts
  3+ 2 - 4i + 5i
  5+ i

Try it Now
1. Subtract 2 + 5i from 3 - 4i .

We can also multiply and divide complex numbers.

Example 4
 Multiply: 4(2 + 5i) .

 To multiply the complex number by a real number, we simply distribute as we would
 when multiplying polynomials.

  4(2 + 5i)
 = 4 2 + 45i
  = 8 + 20i

Example 5
 Divide (2 + 5i) .
            (4 - i)

 To divide two complex numbers, we have to devise a way to write this as a complex
 number with a real part and an imaginary part.

 We start this process by eliminating the complex number in the denominator. To do
 this, we multiply the numerator and denominator by a special complex number so that
 the result in the denominator is a real number. The number we need to multiply by is
 called the complex conjugate, in which the sign of the imaginary part is changed.

 Here, 4+i is the complex conjugate of 4-i. Of course, obeying our algebraic rules, we
 must multiply by 4+i on both the top and bottom.
  (2 + 5i)  (4 + i)
   (4 - i) (4 + i)
212 Chapter 3

To multiply two complex numbers, we expand the product as we would with

polynomials (the process commonly called FOIL - "first outer inner last"). In the

numerator:

(2 + 5i)(4 + i)                  Expand

= 8 + 20i + 2i + 5i2             Since i = -1 , i2 = -1
= 8 + 20i + 2i + 5(-1)                    Simplify

= 3+ 22i

Following the same process to multiply the denominator

(4 - i)(4 + i)                   Expand

= (16 - 4i + 4i - i2)            Since i = -1 , i2 = -1

= (16 - (-1))

=17

Combining this we get 3 + 22i = 3 + 22i

2. Multiply 3 - 4i and 2 + 3i .

In the last example, we used the conjugate of a complex number

 Complex Conjugate
 The conjugate of a complex number a + bi is the number a - bi .
 The notation commonly used for conjugation is a bar: a + bi = a - bi

Complex Zeros of Polynomials
Complex numbers allow us a way to write solutions to quadratic equations that do not
have real solutions.

Example 6
 Find the zeros of f (x) = x2 - 2x + 5.

x = 2  (-2)2 - 4(1)(5) = 2  -16 = 2  4i = 1 2i .

3. Find the zeros of f (x) = 2x2 + 3x + 4 .

Two things are important to note. First, the zeros 1+ 2i and 1- 2i are complex
conjugates. This will always be the case when we find non-real zeros to a quadratic
function with real coefficients.

Second, we could write f (x) = x2 - 2x + 5 = ( x - (1+ 2i))( x - (1- 2i)) if we really wanted

to, so the Factor and Remainder Theorems hold.

How do we know if a general polynomial has any complex zeros? We have seen
examples of polynomials with no real zeros; can there be polynomials with no zeros at
all? The answer to that last question, which comes from the Fundamental Theorem of
Algebra, is "No."

 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
 A non-constant polynomial f with real or complex coefficients will have at least one
 real or complex zero.

This theorem is an example of an "existence" theorem in mathematics. It guarantees the
existence of at least one zero, but provides no algorithm to use for finding it.

Now suppose we have a polynomial f(x) of degree n. The Fundamental Theorem of
Algebra guarantees at least one zero z1 , then the Factor Theorem guarantees that f can be

factored as f (x) = ( x - z1 ) q1(x) , where the quotient q1(x) will be of degree n-1.
214 Chapter 3

If this function is non-constant, than the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra applies to it,
and we can find another zero. This can be repeated n times.

Complex Factorization Theorem

If f is a polynomial f with real or complex coefficients with degree n  1, then f has
exactly n real or complex zeros, counting multiplicities.

If z1, z2, , zk are the distinct zero of f with multiplicities m1, m2,  , mk respectively,

then f (x) = a ( x - z1 )m1 ( x - z2 )m2 ( x - zk )mk

 Find all the real and complex zeros of f (x) = 12x5 - 20x4 +19x3 - 6x2 - 2x +1.

Excellent! So far, we have factored the polynomial to

When factoring a polynomial like we did at the end of the last example, we say that it is
factored completely over the complex numbers, meaning it is impossible to factor the
polynomial any further using complex numbers. If we wanted to factor the function over

                                                                                                                                     2

                                                                     2  3
Since the zeros of x2 - x +1 are nonreal, we call x2 - x +1 an irreducible quadratic
meaning it is impossible to break it down any further using real numbers.

It turns out that a polynomial with real number coefficients can be factored into a product
of linear factors corresponding to the real zeros of the function and irreducible quadratic
factors which give the nonreal zeros of the function. Consequently, any nonreal zeros
will come in conjugate pairs, so if z is a zero of the polynomial, so is z .

Section 3.7 Rational Functions

In the previous sections, we have built polynomials based on the positive whole number
power functions. In this section, we explore functions based on power functions with
negative integer powers, called rational functions.

Example 1
 You plan to drive 100 miles. Find a formula for the time the trip will take as a function
 of the speed you drive.

 You may recall that multiplying speed by time will give you distance. If we let t
 represent the drive time in hours, and v represent the velocity (speed or rate) at which
 we drive, then vt = distance . Since our distance is fixed at 100 miles, vt = 100 .
 Solving this relationship for the time gives us the function we desired:
  t(v) = 100 = 100v-1

           v

While this type of relationship can be written using the negative exponent, it is more
common to see it written as a fraction.

This particular example is one of an inversely proportional relationship - where one
quantity is a constant divided by the other quantity, like y = 5 .

                                                                         x
Notice that this is a transformation of the reciprocal toolkit function, f (x) = 1

                                                                                              x

Several natural phenomena, such as gravitational force and volume of sound, behave in a
manner inversely proportional to the square of another quantity. For example, the

                                                                                                         k
volume, V, of a sound heard at a distance d from the source would be related by V = 2

                                                                                                        d
for some constant value k.

                                                                                                         1
These functions are transformations of the reciprocal squared toolkit function f (x) = 2 .

                                                                                                         x

We have seen the graphs of the basic reciprocal function and the squared reciprocal
function from our study of toolkit functions. These graphs have several important
features.

        x  f (x) = 2

                   x

Let's begin by looking at the reciprocal function, f (x) = 1 . As you well know, dividing
                                                                      x

by zero is not allowed and therefore zero is not in the domain, and so the function is
undefined at an input of zero.

Short run behavior:
As the input values approach zero from the left side (taking on very small, negative
values), the function values become very large in the negative direction (in other words,
they approach negative infinity).
We write: as x  0- , f (x)  - .

As we approach zero from the right side (small, positive input values), the function
values become very large in the positive direction (approaching infinity).
We write: as x  0+ , f (x)   .

This behavior creates a vertical asymptote. An asymptote is a line that the graph
approaches. In this case the graph is approaching the vertical line x = 0 as the input
becomes close to zero.

Long run behavior:
As the values of x approach infinity, the function values approach 0.
As the values of x approach negative infinity, the function values approach 0.
Symbolically: as x  , f (x)  0

Based on this long run behavior and the graph we can see that the function approaches 0
but never actually reaches 0, it just "levels off" as the inputs become large. This behavior
creates a horizontal asymptote. In this case the graph is approaching the horizontal line
 f (x) = 0 as the input becomes very large in the negative and positive directions.

 Vertical and Horizontal Asymptotes
 A vertical asymptote of a graph is a vertical line x = a where the graph tends towards

 positive or negative infinity as the inputs approach a. As x  a , f (x)   .

 A horizontal asymptote of a graph is a horizontal line y = b where the graph
 approaches the line as the inputs get large. As x  , f (x)  b .

Rational Function

A rational function is a function that can be written as the ratio of two polynomials,
P(x) and Q(x).

f (x) =  P(x) a0 + a1x + a2 x2 +  + apxp
           =                      + bq xq

Example 3
 A large mixing tank currently contains 100 gallons of water, into which 5 pounds of
 sugar have been mixed. A tap will open pouring 10 gallons per minute of water into the
 tank at the same time sugar is poured into the tank at a rate of 1 pound per minute. Find
 the concentration (pounds per gallon) of sugar in the tank after t minutes.

 Notice that the amount of water in the tank is changing linearly, as is the amount of
 sugar in the tank. We can write an equation independently for each:
  water = 100 +10t
  sugar = 5 + 1t

 The concentration, C, will be the ratio of pounds of sugar to gallons of water
  C(t) = 5 + t

          100 + 10t

Finding Asymptotes and Intercepts

Given a rational function, as part of investigating the short run behavior we are interested
in finding any vertical and horizontal asymptotes, as well as finding any vertical or
horizontal intercepts, as we have done in the past.

To find vertical asymptotes, we notice that the vertical asymptotes in our examples occur
when the denominator is zero, so the function is undefined. With one exception, a
vertical asymptote will occur whenever the denominator is zero.

Example 4

Find the vertical asymptotes of the function k(x) =  5 + 2x2

                                                     2-x-x    2

To find the vertical asymptotes, we determine where this function will be undefined by
setting the denominator equal to zero:
2- x - x2 = 0

(2 + x)(1 - x) = 0

x = -2, 1
222 Chapter 3

 This indicates two vertical asymptotes, which a look
 at a graph confirms.

The exception to this rule can occur when both the
numerator and denominator of a rational function are zero at the same input.

Example 5
                                                                 x-2

 Find the vertical asymptotes of the function k(x) = 2 .
                                                                 x -4

 To find the vertical asymptotes, we determine where this function will be undefined by
 finding where denominator will be zero. We can do this by factoring:

 k ( x) = 2x - 2 = x - 2 , so the denominator is zero at x = 2, -2

           x - 4 (x - 2)(x + 2)

 However, the numerator of this function is also
 equal to zero when x = 2. The function will still
 be undefined at 2, since 0 is undefined, but if

                                0
  x  2 then x - 2 = 1 which does

                (x - 2)(x + 2) x + 2
 not have a vertical asymptote at x = 2.

 The graph of k(x) will have a vertical asymptote
 at x = -2, but at x = 2 the graph will have a hole:
 a single point where the graph is not defined,
 indicated by an open circle.

 Vertical Asymptotes and Holes of Rational Functions
 At points where the denominator of a rational function equals zero and the numerator
 is not zero, the rational function has a vertical asymptote.

 At points where both the numerator and denominator of a rational function equal zero,
 factor the numerator and denominator and simplify: either the simplified function will
 have a vertical asymptote (and the original function will as well) or the graph of the
 original function will have a hole.
                                                                        3.7 Rational Functions 223

To find horizontal asymptotes, we are interested in the behavior of the function as the
input grows large, so we consider long run behavior of the numerator and denominator
separately. Recall that a polynomial's long run behavior will mirror that of the leading
term. Likewise, a rational function's long run behavior will mirror that of the ratio of the
leading terms of the numerator and denominator functions.

There are three distinct outcomes when this analysis is done:

Case 1: The degree of the denominator > degree of the numerator
                         3x + 2

Example: f (x) = 2
                      x + 4x - 5
                                                      3x 3

In this case, the long run behavior is f (x)  2 = . This tells us that as the inputs grow
                                                      xx

large, this function will behave similarly to the function g(x) = 3 . As the inputs grow
                                                                            x

large, the outputs will approach zero, resulting in a horizontal asymptote at y = 0 .
As x  , f (x)  0

Case 2: The degree of the denominator < degree of the numerator
Example: f (x) = 3x2 + 2

                        x-5
In this case, the long run behavior is f (x)  3x2 = 3x . This tells us that as the inputs

                                                         x
grow large, this function will behave similarly to the function g(x) = 3x . As the inputs
grow large, the outputs will grow and not level off, so this graph has no horizontal
asymptote.
As x  , f (x)   , respectively.

Case 3: The degree of the denominator = degree of the numerator
                         3x2 + 2

Example: f (x) = 2
                       x + 4x - 5
                                                        3x2

In this case, the long run behavior is f (x)  2 = 3 . This tells us that as the inputs grow
                                                         x

large, this function will behave like the function g(x) = 3 , which is a horizontal line. As
x  , f (x)  3 , resulting in a horizontal asymptote at y = 3 .
224 Chapter 3

 Horizontal Asymptote of Rational Functions
 The horizontal asymptote of a rational function can be determined by looking at the
 degrees of the numerator and denominator.
 Degree of denominator > degree of numerator: Horizontal asymptote at y = 0
 Degree of denominator < degree of numerator: No horizontal asymptote
 Degree of denominator = degree of numerator: Horizontal asymptote at ratio of
 leading coefficients.

Example 6
 In the sugar concentration problem from earlier, we created the equation
  C(t) = 5 + t .
          100 + 10t
 Find the horizontal asymptote and interpret it in context of the scenario.

 Both the numerator and denominator are linear (degree 1), so since the degrees are
 equal, there will be a horizontal asymptote at the ratio of the leading coefficients. In the
 numerator, the leading term is t, with coefficient 1. In the denominator, the leading
 term is 10t, with coefficient 10. The horizontal asymptote will be at the ratio of these

 values: As t   , C(t)  1 . This function will have a horizontal asymptote at

 This tells us that as the input gets large, the output values will approach 1/10. In
 context, this means that as more time goes by, the concentration of sugar in the tank will
 approach one tenth of a pound of sugar per gallon of water or 1/10 pounds per gallon.

Example 7
 Find the horizontal and vertical asymptotes of the function
  f (x) = (x - 2)(x + 3)
            (x -1)(x + 2)(x - 5)

 First, note this function has no inputs that make both the numerator and denominator
 zero, so there are no potential holes. The function will have vertical asymptotes when
 the denominator is zero, causing the function to be undefined. The denominator will be
 zero at x = 1, -2, and 5, indicating vertical asymptotes at these values.

 The numerator has degree 2, while the denominator has degree 3. Since the degree of
 the denominator is greater than that of the numerator, the denominator will grow faster
 than the numerator, causing the outputs to tend towards zero as the inputs get large, and
 so as x  , f (x)  0 . This function will have a horizontal asymptote at y = 0 .

Intercepts

As with all functions, a rational function will have a vertical intercept when the input is
zero, if the function is defined at zero. It is possible for a rational function to not have a
vertical intercept if the function is undefined at zero.

Likewise, a rational function will have horizontal intercepts at the inputs that cause the
output to be zero (unless that input corresponds to a hole). It is possible there are no
horizontal intercepts. Since a fraction is only equal to zero when the numerator is zero,
horizontal intercepts will occur when the numerator of the rational function is equal to
zero.

Example 8
 Find the intercepts of f (x) = (x - 2)(x + 3)
                                       (x -1)(x + 2)(x - 5)

 We can find the vertical intercept by evaluating the function at zero
  f (0) = (0 - 2)(0 + 3) = - 6 = - 3

           (0 -1)(0 + 2)(0 - 5) 10 5

The horizontal intercepts will occur when the function is equal to zero:

0 = (x - 2)(x + 3)         This is zero when the numerator is zero

Graphical Behavior at Intercepts and Vertical Asymptotes

As with polynomials, factors of the numerator may have integer powers greater than one.
Happily, the effect on the shape of the graph at those intercepts is the same as we saw
with polynomials: if the factor giving the intercept is not squared, the graph passes
through the axis; if the factor is squared, the graph will bounce off the axis at that
intercept. The behavior at vertical asymptotes also depends on the power on the factor.

Graphical Behavior of Rational Functions at Vertical Asymptotes

If a rational function contains a factor of the form (x - h) p in the denominator, the

behavior near the asymptote h is determined by the power on the factor.

         p = 1             p = 1           p = 2                         p = 2

When the factor is not squared, on one side of the asymptote the graph heads towards
positive infinity and on the other side the graph heads towards negative infinity.

When the factor is squared, the graph either heads toward positive infinity on both
sides of the vertical asymptote, or heads toward negative infinity on both sides.

For example, the graph of

f (x) =  (x + 1)2 (x - 3)  is shown here.

         (x + 3) (x - 2)2

At the horizontal intercept x = -1
corresponding to the (x +1)2 factor of the
numerator, the graph bounces at the
intercept, consistent with the quadratic
nature of the factor.

At the horizontal intercept x = 3 corresponding to the (x - 3) factor of the numerator, the
graph passes through the axis as we'd expect from a linear factor.

At the vertical asymptote x = -3 corresponding to the (x + 3)2 factor of the denominator,
the graph heads towards positive infinity on both sides of the asymptote, consistent with

                         1
the behavior of the 2 toolkit.

At the vertical asymptote x = 2 corresponding to the (x - 2) factor of the denominator,
the graph heads towards positive infinity on the left side of the asymptote and towards
negative infinity on the right side, consistent with the behavior of the 1 toolkit.

                                                                                      x

Example 9
 Sketch a graph of f (x) = 2 (x + 2)(x - 3) .
                                  (x +1) (x - 2)

We can start our sketch by finding intercepts and asymptotes. Evaluating the function

at zero gives the vertical intercept:

f (0) =  (0 + 2)(0 - 3)  =3

         2(0 +1) (0 - 2)

Looking at when the numerator of the function is zero, we can determine the graph will
have horizontal intercepts at x = -2 and x = 3. At each, the behavior will be linear, with
the graph passing through the intercept.

Looking at when the denominator of the function is zero, we can determine the graph
will have vertical asymptotes at x = -1 and x = 2.

Finally, the degree of denominator is larger than the
degree of the numerator, telling us this graph has a
horizontal asymptote at y = 0.
To sketch the graph, we might start by plotting the three
intercepts. Since the graph has no horizontal intercepts
between the vertical asymptotes, and the vertical
intercept is positive, we know the function must remain
positive between the asymptotes, letting us fill in the
middle portion of the graph.

Since the factor associated with the vertical asymptote at x = -1 was squared, we know
the graph will have the same behavior on both sides of the asymptote. Since the graph
heads towards positive infinity as the inputs approach the asymptote on the right, the
graph will head towards positive infinity on the left as
well. For the vertical asymptote at x = 2, the factor was
not squared, so the graph will have opposite behavior on
either side of the asymptote.

After passing through the horizontal intercepts, the graph
will then level off towards an output of zero, as indicated
by the horizontal asymptote.

5. Given the function f (x) =  (x + 2)2 (x - 2)    , use the characteristics of polynomials and

                               22(x -1) (x - 3)

rational functions to describe its behavior and sketch the function.

Since a rational function written in factored form will have a horizontal intercept where
each factor of the numerator is equal to zero, we can form a numerator that will pass
through a set of horizontal intercepts by introducing a corresponding set of factors.
Likewise, since the function will have a vertical asymptote where each factor of the
denominator is equal to zero, we can form a denominator that will produce the vertical
asymptotes by introducing a corresponding set of factors.

Writing Rational Functions from Intercepts and Asymptotes

If a rational function has horizontal intercepts at x = x1, x2 ,, xn , and vertical
asymptotes at x = v1, v2 ,, vm then the function can be written in the form

f (x) = a  (x - x1 ) p1 (x - x2 ) p2 (x - xn ) pn

            q(x - v1) (x - v2 ) (x - vm )1q2qn

where the powers pi or qi on each factor can be determined by the behavior of the
graph at the corresponding intercept or asymptote, and the stretch factor a can be
determined given a value of the function other than the horizontal intercept, or by the
horizontal asymptote if it is nonzero.

Example 10
 Write an equation for the rational function
 graphed here.

 The graph appears to have horizontal
 intercepts at x = -2 and x = 3. At both, the
 graph passes through the intercept,
 suggesting linear factors.

 The graph has two vertical asymptotes.
 The one at x = -1 seems to exhibit the basic
 behavior similar to 1 , with the graph

                          x
 heading toward positive infinity on one
 side and heading toward negative infinity on the other.
                                                               3.7 Rational Functions 229

                                                                       1
The asymptote at x = 2 is exhibiting a behavior similar to 2 , with the graph heading

                                                                       x
toward negative infinity on both sides of the asymptote.

Utilizing this information indicates an function of the form

f (x) = a  (x + 2)(x - 3)

           (x + 1)(x - 2)  2

To find the stretch factor, we can use another clear point on the graph, such as the

vertical intercept (0,-2):

-2=a  (0 + 2)(0 - 3)

      (0 + 1)(0 - 2)  2

-2 = a -6
          4

a = -8 = 4
     -6 3

This gives us a final function of f (x) =  4(x + 2)(x - 3)

                                           3(x + 1)(x - 2)  2

Oblique Asymptotes

Earlier we saw graphs of rational functions that had no horizontal asymptote, which
occurs when the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator.
We can, however, describe in more detail the long-run behavior of a rational function.

Example 11
 Describe the long-run behavior of f (x) = 3x2 + 2
                                                         x-5

 Earlier we explored this function when discussing horizontal asymptotes. We found the
 long-run behavior is f (x)  3x2 = 3x , meaning that x  , f (x)   ,

                                       x
 respectively, and there is no horizontal asymptote.

 If we were to do polynomial long division, we could get a better understanding of the
 behavior as x  .
230 Chapter 3

                   3x +15
  x - 5 3x 2+ 0x + 2

     -(3x2 -15x)

                  15x + 2

          -(15x - 75)

                       77
 This means f (x) = 3x2 + 2 can be rewritten as

                             x-5
  f (x) = 3x +15 + 77 .

                      x-5
 As x  , the term 77 will become very

                              x-5
 small and approach zero, becoming insignificant.
 The remaining 3x +15 then describes the long-run
 behavior of the function: as x  ,
  f (x)  3x +15 .

 We call this equation y = 3x +15 the oblique
 asymptote of the function.

 In the graph, you can see how the function is
 approaching the line on the far left and far right.

 Oblique Asymptotes
 To explore the long-run behavior of a rational function,
 1) Perform polynomial long division (or synthetic division)
 2) The quotient will describe the asymptotic behavior of the function

 When this result is a line, we call it an oblique asymptote, or slant asymptote.

Example 12
 Find the oblique asymptote of f (x) = -x2 + 2x +1
                                                       x +1

 Performing polynomial long division:

  x +1 - x 2 +2x +1

     -(-x2 - x)

                   3x +1

            -(3x + 3)

                       -2
This allows us to rewrite the function as
 f (x) = -x + 3 - 2 .

                   x +1

The quotient, y = -x + 3 , is the oblique asymptote
of f(x). Just like functions we saw earlier
approached their horizontal asymptote in the long
run, this function will approach this oblique
asymptote in the long run.

6. Find the oblique asymptote of f (x) = 1+ 7x - 2x2

                                                   x-2

While we primarily concern ourselves with oblique asymptotes, this same approach can
describe other asymptotic behavior.

Example 13
 Describe the long-run shape of f (x) = -x3 - x2 + 4x + 2
                                                           x +1

 We could rewrite this using long division as
  f (x) = -x2 + 4 + 2 .

                       x +1

 Just looking at the quotient gives us the
 asymptote, y = -x2 + 4 .

 This suggests that in the long run, the function
 will behave like a downwards opening parabola.
 The function will also have a vertical asymptote
 at x = -1 .

Section 3.8 Inverses and Radical Functions

In this section, we will explore the inverses of polynomial and rational functions, and in
particular the radical functions that arise in the process.

Example 1
 A water runoff collector is built in the shape of a parabolic trough as shown below.
 Find the surface area of the water in the trough as a function of the depth of the water.

                                                                      12 in
                                            3ft

                               18 in

 Since it will be helpful to have an equation for the parabolic cross-sectional shape, we
 will impose a coordinate system at the cross section, with x measured horizontally and y
 measured vertically, with the origin at the vertex of the parabola.

                                                   x

 From this we find an equation for the parabolic shape. Since we placed the origin at the
 vertex of the parabola, we know the equation will have form y(x) = ax2 . Our equation
 will need to pass through the point (6,18), from which we can solve for the stretch
 factor a:
 18 = a62
  a = 18 = 1

       36 2
 Our parabolic cross section has equation y(x) = 1 x 2

                                                             2
 Since we are interested in the surface area of the water, we are interested in determining
 the width at the top of the water as a function of the water depth. For any depth y the
 width will be given by 2x, so we need to solve the equation above for x. However
 notice that the original function is not one-to-one, and indeed given any output there are
 two inputs that produce the same output, one positive and one negative.
240 Chapter 3

 To find an inverse, we can restrict our original function to a limited domain on which it
 is one-to-one. In this case, it makes sense to restrict ourselves to positive x values. On
 this domain, we can find an inverse by solving for the input variable:
  y = 1 x2

       2
  2y = x2
  x =  2y

 This is not a function as written. Since we are limiting ourselves to positive x values,
 we eliminate the negative solution, giving us the inverse function we're looking for
  x(y) = 2y

 Since x measures from the center out, the entire width of the water at the top will be 2x.
 Since the trough is 3 feet (36 inches) long, the surface area will then be 36(2x), or in
 terms of y:
  Area = 72 x = 72 2 y

The previous example illustrated two important things:
    1) When finding the inverse of a quadratic, we have to limit ourselves to a domain
         on which the function is one-to-one.
    2) The inverse of a quadratic function is a square root function. Both are toolkit
         functions and different types of power functions.

Functions involving roots are often called radical functions.

Example 2
 Find the inverse of f (x) = (x - 2)2 - 3 = x2 - 4x +1

From the transformation form of the function, we can see this is a transformed quadratic
with vertex at (2,-3) that opens upwards. Since the graph will be decreasing on one
side of the vertex, and increasing on the other side, we can restrict this function to a
domain on which it will be one-to-one by limiting the domain to x  2.

To find the inverse, we will use the vertex form of the quadratic. We start by replacing

the f(x) with a simple variable y, then solve for x.

y = (x - 2)2 - 3  Add 3 to both sides

y + 3 = (x - 2)2  Take the square root

 y+3=x-2          Add 2 to both sides

2 y+3 = x
                                       3.8 Inverses and Radical Functions 241

Of course, as written this is not a function. Since we restricted our original function to a
domain of x  2, the outputs of the inverse should be the same, telling us to utilize the
positive case:
x = f -1 ( y) = 2 + y + 3

If the quadratic had not been given in vertex form, rewriting it into vertex form is
probably the best approach. Alternatively, we could have taken the standard equation
and rewritten it equal to zero:
0 = x2 - 4x +1- y

We would then be able to use the quadratic formula with a =1, b = -4 , and c = (1- y) ,

resulting in the same solutions we found above:

x=  -(-4)  (-4)2 - 4(1)(1- y)  = 2  12 + 4 y     = 2 3+ y

    2                               2

1. Find the inverse of the function f (x) = x2 +1 , on the domain x  0 .

While it is not possible to find an inverse of most polynomial functions, some other basic
polynomials are invertible.

Example 3
 Find the inverse of the function f (x) = 5x3 +1.

 This is a transformation of the basic cubic toolkit function, and based on our knowledge
 of that function, we know it is one-to-one. Solving for the inverse by solving for x
  y = 5x3 +1
  y -1 = 5x3
  y -1 = x3

    5
  x = f -1 ( y) = 3 y - 1

                      5

Notice that this inverse is also a transformation of a power function with a fractional
power, x1/3.

2. Which toolkit functions have inverse functions without restricting their domain?

Besides being important as an inverse function, radical functions are common in
important physical models.

Example 4
 The velocity, v in feet per second, of a car that slammed on its brakes can be determined
 based on the length of skid marks that the tires left on the ground. This relationship is
 given by
  v(d) = 2gfd
 In this formula, g represents acceleration due to gravity (32 ft/sec2), d is the length of
 the skid marks in feet, and f is a constant representing the friction of the surface. A car
 lost control on wet asphalt, with a friction coefficient of 0.5, leaving 200 foot skid
 marks. How fast was the car travelling when it lost control?

 Using the given values of f = 0.5 and d = 200, we can evaluate the given formula:
  v(200) = 2(32)(0.5)(200) = 80 ft/sec , which is about 54.5 miles per hour.

When radical functions are composed with other functions, determining domain can
become more complicated.

Example 5                                 (x + 2)(x - 3) .
 Find the domain of the function f (x) =      (x -1)

Since a square root is only defined when the quantity under the radical is non-negative,
we need to determine where (x + 2)(x - 3)  0 . A rational function can change signs

                                         (x -1)
(change from positive to negative or vice versa) at horizontal intercepts and at vertical
asymptotes. For this equation, the graph could change signs at x = -2, 1, and 3.

To determine on which intervals the rational expression is positive, we could evaluate
the expression at test values, or sketch a graph. While both approaches work equally
well, for this example we will use a graph.

This function has two horizontal intercepts, both of which exhibit linear behavior,
where the graph will pass through the intercept. There is one vertical asymptote,
corresponding to a linear factor, leading to a behavior similar to the basic reciprocal
toolkit function. There is a vertical intercept at (0, 6).
                                                       3.8 Inverses and Radical Functions 243

This graph does not have a horizontal asymptote, since the degree of the numerator is
larger than the degree of the denominator.

From the vertical intercept and horizontal intercept at x = -2, we can sketch the left side
of the graph. From the behavior at the asymptote,
we can sketch the right side of the graph.

From the graph, we can now tell on which
intervals this expression will be non-negative, so
the original function f(x) will be defined.
f(x) has domain - 2  x  1 or x  3 , or in interval

notation, [-2,1)  [3, ) .

Like with finding inverses of quadratic functions, it is sometimes desirable to find the
inverse of a rational function, particularly of rational functions that are the ratio of linear
functions, such as our concentration examples.

Example 6
 The function C(n) = 20 + 0.4n was used in the previous section to represent the
                             100 + n
 concentration of an acid solution after n mL of 40% solution has been added to 100 mL
 of a 20% solution. We might want to be able to determine instead how much 40%
 solution has been added based on the current concentration of the mixture.

To do this, we would want the inverse of this function:

C = 20 + 0.4n      multiply both sides by the denominator
      100 + n

C(100 + n) = 20 + 0.4n distribute

100C + Cn = 20 + 0.4n group everything with n on one side

100C - 20 = 0.4n - Cn factor out n

100C - 20 = (0.4 - C)n divide to find the inverse

n(C) = 100C - 20
          0.4 - C

If, for example, we wanted to know how many mL of 40% solution need to be added to
obtain a concentration of 35%, we can simply evaluate the inverse rather than solving
an equation involving the original function:
n(0.35) = 100(0.35) - 20 = 15 = 300 mL of 40% solution would need to be added.

Section 4.1 Exponential Functions

India is the second most populous country in the world, with a population in 2008 of
about 1.14 billion people. The population is growing by about 1.34% each year1. We
might ask if we can find a formula to model the population, P, as a function of time, t, in
years after 2008, if the population continues to grow at this rate.

In linear growth, we had a constant rate of change - a constant number that the output
increased for each increase in input. For example, in the equation f (x) = 3x + 4 , the
slope tells us the output increases by three each time the input increases by one. This
population scenario is different - we have a percent rate of change rather than a constant
number of people as our rate of change.

To see the significance of this difference consider these two companies:

Company A has 100 stores, and expands by opening 50 new stores a year

Company B has 100 stores, and expands by increasing the number of stores by 50% of
their total each year.

Looking at a few years of growth for these companies:

                        stores in the first year. 100 + 0.50(100) = 150

2  150 + 50 = 200       Store A grows by 50, 150 + 50% of 150

                        Store B grows by 75 150 + 0.50(150) = 225

3  200 + 50 = 250       Store A grows by 50, 225 + 50% of 225

                        Store B grows by 112.5 225 + 0.50(225) = 337.5

Notice that with the percent growth, each year the company grows by 50% of the current
year's total, so as the company grows larger, the number of stores added in a year grows
as well.

To try to simplify the calculations, notice that after 1 year the number of stores for

company B was:

100 + 0.50(100)      or equivalently by factoring

100(1 + 0.50) = 150

We can think of this as "the new number of stores is the original 100% plus another
50%".

After 2 years, the number of stores was:

150 + 0.50(150)      or equivalently by factoring

150(1 + 0.50)        now recall the 150 came from 100(1+0.50). Substituting that,

100(1+ 0.50)(1+ 0.50) = 100(1+ 0.50)2 = 225

After 3 years, the number of stores was:

225 + 0.50(225) or equivalently by factoring

225(1 + 0.50)        now recall the 225 came from 100(1+ 0.50)2 . Substituting that,

100(1+ 0.50)2 (1+ 0.50) = 100(1+ 0.50)3 = 337.5

From this, we can generalize, noticing that to show a 50% increase, each year we
multiply by a factor of (1+0.50), so after n years, our equation would be
B(n) = 100(1+ 0.50)n

In this equation, the 100 represented the initial quantity, and the 0.50 was the percent
growth rate. Generalizing further, we arrive at the general form of exponential functions.

 Exponential Function
 An exponential growth or decay function is a function that grows or shrinks at a
 constant percent growth rate. The equation can be written in the form
  f (x) = a(1+ r)x or f (x) = abx where b = 1+r

 Where
 a is the initial or starting value of the function
 r is the percent growth or decay rate, written as a decimal
 b is the growth factor or growth multiplier. Since powers of negative numbers behave
 strangely, we limit b to positive values.

To see more clearly the difference between exponential and linear growth, compare the
two tables and graphs below, which illustrate the growth of company A and B described
above over a longer time frame if the growth patterns were to continue.

Example 1
 Write an exponential function for India's population, and use it to predict the population
 in 2020.

 At the beginning of the chapter we were given India's population of 1.14 billion in the
 year 2008 and a percent growth rate of 1.34%. Using 2008 as our starting time (t = 0),
 our initial population will be 1.14 billion. Since the percent growth rate was 1.34%, our
 value for r is 0.0134.
 Using the basic formula for exponential growth f (x) = a(1+ r)x we can write the
 formula, f (t) = 1.14(1+ 0.0134 )t

 To estimate the population in 2020, we evaluate the function at t = 12, since 2020 is 12
 years after 2008.
  f (12) = 1.14(1+ 0.0134 )12  1.337 billion people in 2020

 For comparison, the actual population of India in 2020 was about 1.380 billion.

1. Given the three statements below, identify which represent exponential functions.

A. The cost of living allowance for state employees increases salaries by 3.1% each year.
B. State employees can expect a $300 raise each year they work for the state.
C. Tuition costs have increased by 2.8% each year for the last 3 years.

Example 2
 A certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of savings account offered by banks, typically
 offering a higher interest rate in return for a fixed length of time you will leave your
 money invested. If a bank offers a 24 month CD with an annual interest rate of 1.2%
 compounded monthly, how much will a $1000 investment grow to over those 24
 months?

 First, we must notice that the interest rate is an annual rate, but is compounded monthly,
 meaning interest is calculated and added to the account monthly. To find the monthly
 interest rate, we divide the annual rate of 1.2% by 12 since there are 12 months in a
 year: 1.2%/12 = 0.1%. Each month we will earn 0.1% interest. From this, we can set
 up an exponential function, with our initial amount of $1000 and a growth rate of r =
 0.001, and our input m measured in months.

                  .012 m
  f (m) = 1000 1 + 

                  12 
  f (m) = 1000 (1+ 0.001)m
 After 24 months, the account will have grown to f (24) = 1000(1+ 0.001)24 = $1024.28

2. Looking at these two equations that represent the balance in two different savings

accounts, which account is growing faster, and which account will have a higher

balance after 3 years?

A(t) = 1000 (1.05)t     B(t) = 900(1.075)t

In all the preceding examples, we saw exponential growth. Exponential functions can
also be used to model quantities that are decreasing at a constant percent rate. An
example of this is radioactive decay, a process in which radioactive isotopes of certain
atoms transform to an atom of a different type, causing a percentage decrease of the
original material over time.
                                                          Section 4.1 Exponential Functions 253

Example 3
 Bismuth-210 is an isotope that radioactively decays by about 13% each day, meaning
 13% of the remaining Bismuth-210 transforms into another atom (polonium-210 in this
 case) each day. If you begin with 100 mg of Bismuth-210, how much remains after one
 week?

 With radioactive decay, instead of the quantity increasing at a percent rate, the quantity
 is decreasing at a percent rate. Our initial quantity is a = 100 mg, and our growth rate
 will be negative 13%, since we are decreasing: r = -0.13. This gives the equation:
  Q(d) = 100(1- 0.13)d = 100(0.87)d
 This can also be explained by recognizing that if 13% decays, then 87 % remains.

 After one week, 7 days, the quantity remaining would be
  Q(7) = 100(0.87)7 = 37.73 mg of Bismuth-210 remains.

3. A population of 1000 is decreasing 3% each year. Find the population in 30 years.

Example 4
 T(q) represents the total number of Android smart phone contracts, in thousands, held
 by a certain Verizon store region measured quarterly since January 1, 2016,
 Interpret all the parts of the equation T (2) = 86(1.64)2 = 231.3056 .

 Interpreting this from the basic exponential form, we know that 86 is our initial value.
 This means that on Jan. 1, 2016 this region had 86,000 Android smart phone contracts.
 Since b = 1 + r = 1.64, we know that every quarter the number of smart phone contracts
 grows by 64%. T(2) = 231.3056 means that in the 2nd quarter (or at the end of the
 second quarter) there were approximately 231,306 Android smart phone contracts.

Finding Equations of Exponential Functions

In the previous examples, we were able to write equations for exponential functions since
we knew the initial quantity and the growth rate. If we do not know the growth rate, but
instead know only some input and output pairs of values, we can still construct an
exponential function.

Example 5
 In 2009, 80 deer were reintroduced into a wildlife refuge area from which the
 population had previously been hunted to elimination. By 2015, the population had
 grown to 180 deer. If this population grows exponentially, find a formula for the
 function.
254 Chapter 4

By defining our input variable to be t, years after 2009, the information listed can be
written as two input-output pairs: (0,80) and (6,180). Notice that by choosing our input
variable to be measured as years after the first year value provided, we have effectively
"given" ourselves the initial value for the function: a = 80. This gives us an equation
of the form
 f (t) = 80bt .

Substituting in our second input-output pair allows us to solve for b:

180 = 80b6        Divide by 80

b6 = 180 = 9      Take the 6th root of both sides.
       80 4

b = 6 9 = 1.1447
      4

This gives us our equation for the population:
 f (t) = 80(1.1447 )t

Recall that since b = 1+r, we can interpret this to mean that the population growth rate
is r = 0.1447, and so the population is growing by about 14.47% each year.

In this example, you could also have used (9/4)^(1/6) to evaluate the 6th root if your
calculator doesn't have an nth root button.

In the previous example, we chose to use the f (x) = abx form of the exponential
function rather than the f (x) = a(1+ r)x form. This choice was entirely arbitrary -
either form would be fine to use.

When finding equations, the value for b or r will usually have to be rounded to be written
easily. To preserve accuracy, it is important to not over-round these values. Typically,
you want to be sure to preserve at least 3 significant digits in the growth rate. For
example, if your value for b was 1.00317643, you would want to round this no further
than to 1.00318.

In the previous example, we were able to "give" ourselves the initial value by clever
definition of our input variable. Next, we consider a situation where we can't do this.

Example 6
 Find a formula for an exponential function passing through the points (-2,6) and (2,1).

 Since we don't have the initial value, we will take a general approach that will work for
 any function form with unknown parameters: we will substitute in both given input-
 output pairs in the function form f (x) = abx and solve for the unknown values, a and b.
 Substituting in (-2, 6) gives 6 = ab-2
 Substituting in (2, 1) gives 1 = ab2

 We now solve these as a system of equations. To do so, we could try a substitution
 approach, solving one equation for a variable, then substituting that expression into the
 second equation.
 Solving 6 = ab-2 for a:
  a = -2 6 = 6b2

       b

 In the second equation, 1 = ab2 , we substitute the expression above for a:
 1 = (6b2 )b2
 1 = 6b4
  1 = b4
  6
  b = 4 1  0.6389

         6

 Going back to the equation a = 6b2 lets us find a:
  a = 6b2 = 6(0.6389 )2 = 2.4492

 Putting this together gives the equation f (x) = 2.4492 (0.6389 )x

Example 7
 Find an equation for the exponential function
 graphed.

The initial value for the function is not clear in this
graph, so we will instead work using two clearer
points. There are three clear points: (-1, 1), (1, 2),
and (3, 4). As we saw in the last example, two
points are sufficient to find the equation for a
standard exponential, so we will use the latter two
points.

Substituting in (1,2) gives 2 = ab1
Substituting in (3,4) gives 4 = ab3

Solving the first equation for a gives a = 2 .
                                                     b

Substituting this expression for a into the second equation:

4 = ab3

4 = 2 b3 = 2b3  Simplify the right-hand side
b        b

4 = 2b2

2 = b2

b= 2

Since we restrict ourselves to positive values of b, we will use b =  2 . We can then go
back and find a:
a=2= 2 = 2

     b2

This gives us a final equation of f (x) = 2( 2) x .

Compound Interest

In the bank certificate of deposit (CD) example earlier in the section, we encountered
compound interest. Typically bank accounts and other savings instruments in which
earnings are reinvested, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, utilize compound
interest. The term compounding comes from the behavior that interest is earned not on
the original value, but on the accumulated value of the account.
                                                          Section 4.1 Exponential Functions 257

In the example from earlier, the interest was compounded monthly, so we took the annual
interest rate, usually called the nominal rate or annual percentage rate (APR) and
divided by 12, the number of compounds in a year, to find the monthly interest. The
exponent was then measured in months.

Generalizing this, we can form a general formula for compound interest. If the APR is
written in decimal form as r, and there are k compounding periods per year, then the
interest per compounding period will be r/k. Likewise, if we are interested in the value
after t years, then there will be kt compounding periods in that time.

 Compound Interest Formula
 Compound Interest can be calculated using the formula

             r kt
  A(t) = a1 + 

             k
 Where
 A(t) is the account value
 t is measured in years
 a is the starting amount of the account, often called the principal
 r is the annual percentage rate (APR), also called the nominal rate
 k is the number of compounding periods in one year

Example 8
 If you invest $3,000 in an investment account paying 3% interest compounded
 quarterly, how much will the account be worth in 10 years?

 Since we are starting with $3000, a = 3000
 Our interest rate is 3%, so r = 0.03
 Since we are compounding quarterly, we are compounding 4 times per year, so k = 4
 We want to know the value of the account in 10 years, so we are looking for A(10), the
 value when t = 10.

                   0.03 4(10)
  A(10) = 3000 1 +  = $4045 .05

                   4

 The account will be worth $4045.05 in 10 years.
258 Chapter 4

Example 9
 A 529 plan is a college savings plan in which a relative can invest money to pay for a
 child's later college tuition, and the account grows tax free. If Lily wants to set up a
 529 account for her new granddaughter, wants the account to grow to $40,000 over 18
 years, and she believes the account will earn 6% compounded semi-annually (twice a
 year), how much will Lily need to invest in the account now?

 Since the account is earning 6%, r = 0.06
 Since interest is compounded twice a year, k = 2

 In this problem, we don't know how much we are starting with, so we will be solving
 for a, the initial amount needed. We do know we want the end amount to be $40,000,
 so we will be looking for the value of a so that A(18) = 40,000.

                          0.06 2(18)
  40,000 = A(18) = a1 + 

                          2
  40,000 = a(2.8983 )
  a = 40,000  $13,801

 Lily will need to invest $13,801 to have $40,000 in 18 years.

5. Recalculate example 2 from above with quarterly compounding.

Because of compounding throughout the year, with compound interest the actual increase
in a year is more than the annual percentage rate. If $1,000 were invested at 10%, the
table below shows the value after 1 year at different compounding frequencies:

Frequency     Value after 1 year
Annually      $1100
Semiannually  $1102.50
Quarterly     $1103.81
Monthly       $1104.71
Daily         $1105.16

If we were to compute the actual percentage increase for the daily compounding, there
was an increase of $105.16 from an original amount of $1,000, for a percentage increase
of 105.16 = 0.10516 = 10.516% increase. This quantity is called the annual percentage

     1000
yield (APY).
                        Section 4.1 Exponential Functions 259

Notice that given any starting amount, the amount after 1 year would be

          r k
A(1) = a1 +  . To find the total change, we would subtract the original amount, then

          k

to find the percentage change we would divide that by the original amount:

 r k
a1 +  - a
 k          r        k

a          = 1 +  -1
            k

Annual Percentage Yield

The annual percentage yield is the actual percent a quantity increases in one year. It
can be calculated as

          r k
APY = 1 +  -1

          k

This is equivalent to finding the value of $1 after 1 year, and subtracting the original
dollar.

Example 10
 Bank A offers an account paying 1.2% compounded quarterly. Bank B offers an
 account paying 1.1% compounded monthly. Which is offering a better rate?

We can compare these rates using the annual percentage yield - the actual percent

increase in a year.

            0.012 4
Bank A: APY = 1 +        -1 = 0.012054 = 1.2054%
            4

            0.011 12
Bank B: APY = 1 +        -1 = 0.011056 = 1.1056%
            12 

Bank B's monthly compounding is not enough to catch up with Bank A's better APR.
Bank A offers a better rate.

A Limit to Compounding

As we saw earlier, the amount we earn increases as we increase the compounding
frequency. The table, though, shows that the increase from annual to semi-annual
compounding is larger than the increase from monthly to daily compounding. This might
lead us to believe that although increasing the frequency of compounding will increase
our result, there is an upper limit to this process.
260 Chapter 4

To see this, let us examine the value of $1 invested at 100% interest for 1 year.

Frequency        Value
Annual           $2
Quarterly        $2.441406
Monthly          $2.613035
Daily            $2.714567
Hourly           $2.718127
Once per minute  $2.718279
Once per second  $2.718282

These values do indeed appear to be approaching an upper limit. This value ends up

being so important that it gets represented by its own letter, much like how  represents a

number.

Euler's Number: e
                                                        1 k

e is the letter used to represent the value that 1 +  approaches as k gets big.

e  2.718282

Because e is often used as the base of an exponential, most scientific and graphing
calculators have a button that can calculate powers of e, usually labeled ex. Some
computer software instead defines a function exp(x), where exp(x) = ex.

Because e arises when the time between compounds becomes very small, e allows us to
define continuous growth and allows us to define a new toolkit function, f (x) = ex .

 Continuous Growth Formula
 Continuous Growth can be calculated using the formula
  f (x) = aerx
 where
 a is the starting amount
 r is the continuous growth rate

This type of equation is commonly used when describing quantities that change more or
less continuously, like chemical reactions, growth of large populations, and radioactive
decay.

Example 11
 Radon-222 decays at a continuous rate of 17.3% per day. How much will 100mg of
 Radon-222 decay to in 3 days?

 Since we are given a continuous decay rate, we use the continuous growth formula.
 Since the substance is decaying, we know the growth rate will be negative: r = -0.173
  f (3) = 100e-0.173(3)  59.512 mg of Radon-222 will remain.

6. Interpret the following: S(t) = 20e0.12t if S(t) represents the growth of a substance in

   grams, and time is measured in days.

Continuous growth is also often applied to compound interest, allowing us to talk about
continuous compounding.

Example 12
 If $1000 is invested in an account earning 10% compounded continuously, find the
 value after 1 year.

 Here, the continuous growth rate is 10%, so r = 0.10. We start with $1000, so a = 1000.
 To find the value after 1 year,
  f (1) = 1000 e0.10(1)  $1105 .17

 Notice this is a $105.17 increase for the year. As a percent increase, this is
  105.17 = 0.10517 = 10.517% increase over the original $1000.
   1000

Notice that this value is slightly larger than the amount generated by daily compounding
in the table computed earlier.

The continuous growth rate is like the nominal growth rate (or APR) - it reflects the
growth rate before compounding takes effect. This is different than the annual growth
rate used in the formula f (x) = a(1+ r)x , which is like the annual percentage yield - it

reflects the actual amount the output grows in a year.

While the continuous growth rate in the example above was 10%, the actual annual yield

was 10.517%. This means we could write two different looking but equivalent formulas

for this account's growth:

f (t) = 1000e0.10t          using the 10% continuous growth rate

f (t) = 1000(1.10517)t      using the 10.517% actual annual yield rate.

Section 4.2 Graphs of Exponential Functions

Like with linear functions, the graph of an exponential function is determined by the
values for the parameters in the function's formula.

To get a sense for the behavior of exponentials, let us begin by looking more closely at
the function f (x) = 2x . Listing a table of values for this function:

x     -3  -2  -1                            0       1  2  3

      1   1   1
f(x) 8 4 2 1 2 4 8

Notice that:
    1) This function is positive for all values of x.
    2) As x increases, the function grows faster and faster (the rate of change
           increases).
    3) As x decreases, the function values grow smaller, approaching zero.
    4) This is an example of exponential growth.

                                       1 x
Looking at the function g(x) =  

                                      2

x     -3  -2  -1                            0       1  2  3

g(x)  8   4   2                             1       1  1  1

                                                    2  4  8

Note this function is also positive for all values of x, but in this case grows as x decreases,
and decreases towards zero as x increases. This is an example of exponential decay. You
may notice from the table that this function appears to be the horizontal reflection of the
 f (x) = 2x table. This is in fact the case:

                             1 x
 f (-x) = 2-x = (2-1 ) x =   = g(x)

                            2

Looking at the graphs also confirms this
relationship.

Consider a function of the form f (x) = abx .
Since a, which we called the initial value in the
last section, is the function value at an input of
zero, a will give us the vertical intercept of the
graph.
268 Chapter 4

From the graphs above, we can see that an exponential graph will have a horizontal
asymptote on one side of the graph, and can either increase or decrease, depending upon
the growth factor. This horizontal asymptote will also help us determine the long run
behavior and is easy to determine from the graph.

The graph will grow when the growth rate is positive, which will make the growth factor
b larger than one. When it's negative, the growth factor will be less than one.

 Graphical Features of Exponential Functions
 Graphically, in the function f (x) = abx
 a is the vertical intercept of the graph
 b determines the rate at which the graph grows. When a is positive,

         the function will increase if b > 1
         the function will decrease if 0 < b < 1
 The graph will have a horizontal asymptote at y = 0
 The graph will be concave up if a > 0; concave down if a < 0.

 The domain of the function is all real numbers
 The range of the function is (0, )

When sketching the graph of an exponential function, it can be helpful to remember that
the graph will pass through the points (0, a) and (1, ab).

The value b will determine the function's long run behavior:

If b > 1, as x   , f (x)   and as x  - , f (x)  0 .
If 0 < b < 1, as x   , f (x)  0 and as x  - , f (x)   .

Example 1
                                 1x

 Sketch a graph of f (x) = 4 
                                 3

 This graph will have a vertical intercept at (0,4), and pass
                         4

 through the point 1,  . Since b < 1, the graph will be
                         3

 decreasing towards zero. Since a > 0, the graph will be
 concave up.

 We can also see from the graph the long run behavior: as

  x   , f (x)  0 and as x  - , f (x)   .
                                             Section 4.2 Graphs of Exponential Functions 269
To get a better feeling for the effect of a and b on the graph, examine the sets of graphs
below. The first set shows various graphs, where a remains the same and we only change
the value for b.

Notice that the closer the value of b is to 1, the less steep the graph will be.
In the next set of graphs, a is altered and our value for b remains the same.

Notice that changing the value for a changes the vertical intercept. Since a is multiplying
the bx term, a acts as a vertical stretch factor, not as a shift. Notice also that the long run
behavior for all of these functions is the same because the growth factor did not change
and none of these a values introduced a vertical flip.
270 Chapter 4
Example 2

 Match each equation with its graph.
  f (x) = 2(1.3) x
  g(x) = 2(1.8) x
  h(x) = 4(1.3) x
  k(x) = 4(0.7) x

 The graph of k(x) is the easiest to identify, since it is the only equation with a growth
 factor less than one, which will produce a decreasing graph. The graph of h(x) can be
 identified as the only growing exponential function with a vertical intercept at (0,4).
 The graphs of f(x) and g(x) both have a vertical intercept at (0,2), but since g(x) has a
 larger growth factor, we can identify it as the graph increasing faster.

Try it Now
1. Graph the following functions on the same axis:

   f (x) = (2) x ; g(x) = 2(2)x ; h(x) = 2(1/ 2)x .

Transformations of Exponential Graphs
While exponential functions can be transformed following the same rules as any function,
there are a few interesting features of transformations that can be identified. The first
was seen at the beginning of the section - that a horizontal reflection is equivalent to a
change in the growth factor. Likewise, since a is itself a stretch factor, a vertical stretch
of an exponential corresponds with a change in the initial value of the function.
                                             Section 4.2 Graphs of Exponential Functions 271

Next consider the effect of a horizontal shift on an exponential function. Shifting the
function f (x) = 3(2)x four units to the left would give f (x + 4) = 3(2) x+4 . Employing
exponent rules, we could rewrite this:
 f (x + 4) = 3(2)x+4 = 3(2) x (24 ) = 48(2) x

Interestingly, it turns out that a horizontal shift of an exponential function corresponds
with a change in initial value of the function.

Lastly, consider the effect of a vertical shift on an exponential function. Shifting
 f (x) = 3(2)x down 4 units would give the equation f (x) = 3(2)x - 4 .

Graphing that, notice it is substantially different
than the basic exponential graph. Unlike a basic
exponential, this graph does not have a
horizontal asymptote at y = 0; due to the vertical
shift, the horizontal asymptote has also shifted

to y = -4. We can see that as x  , f (x)  
and as x  - , f (x)  -4 .

We have determined that a vertical shift is the
only transformation of an exponential function
that changes the graph in a way that cannot be
achieved by altering the parameters a and b in the basic exponential function f (x) = abx .

 Transformations of Exponentials
 Any transformed exponential can be written in the form
  f (x) = abx + c

 where y = c is the horizontal asymptote.

Note that, due to the shift, the vertical intercept is shifted to (0, a+c).

2. Write the equation and graph the exponential function described as follows:

     f (x) = ex is vertically stretched by a factor of 2, flipped across the y axis and shifted
    up 4 units.

 Sketch a graph of f (x) = -3  + 4 .
                                   2

Notice that in this exponential function, the negative in the stretch factor -3 will cause a

vertical reflection, and the vertical shift up 4 will move the horizontal asymptote to

                                                             1 x
y = 4. Sketching this as a transformation of g(x) =   ,

                                                            2

The basic g(x) =  

                    2

 Vertically shifted up four units

 Notice that while the domain of this function is unchanged, due to the reflection and

 shift, the range of this function is (-, 4) .

 As x   , f (x)  4 and as x  - , f (x)  - .

Functions leading to graphs like the one above are common as models for learning and
models of growth approaching a limit.

 Find an equation for the function graphed.

 Looking at this graph, it appears to have a horizontal
 asymptote at y = 5, suggesting an equation of the form
  f (x) = abx + 5 . To find values for a and b, we can
 identify two other points on the graph. It appears the
 graph passes through (0,2) and (-1,3), so we can use
 those points. Substituting in (0,2) allows us to solve
 for a.
  2 = ab0 + 5
  2 = a+5
  a = -3

 Substituting in (-1,3) allows us to solve for b
  3 = -3b-1 + 5

A population of 50 flies is expected to double every week, leading to a function of the

form f (x) = 50(2)x , where x represents the number of weeks that have passed. When

will this population reach 500? Trying to solve this problem leads to:

500 = 50(2)x  Dividing both sides by 50 to isolate the exponential

10 = 2x

While we have set up exponential models and used them to make predictions, you may
have noticed that solving exponential equations has not yet been mentioned. The reason
is simple: none of the algebraic tools discussed so far are sufficient to solve exponential
equations. Consider the equation 2 x = 10 above. We know that 23 = 8 and 24 = 16 , so
it is clear that x must be some value between 3 and 4 since g(x) = 2x is increasing. We

could use technology to create a table of values or graph to better estimate the solution.

From the graph, we could better estimate the solution to be
around 3.3. This result is still fairly unsatisfactory, and since
the exponential function is one-to-one, it would be great to
have an inverse function. None of the functions we have
already discussed would serve as an inverse function and so
we must introduce a new function, named log as the inverse
of an exponential function. Since exponential functions have
different bases, we will define corresponding logarithms of
different bases as well.

Logarithm

The logarithm (base b) function, written log b (x), is the inverse of the exponential

function (base b), bx .

Since the logarithm and exponential are inverses, it follows that:

 Properties of Logs: Inverse Properties

 log b (b x ) = x

  b logb x = x

Recall from the definition of an inverse function that if f (a) = c , then f -1(c) = a .

Applying this to the exponential and logarithmic functions, we can convert between a
logarithmic equation and its equivalent exponential.
278 Chapter 4

 Logarithm Equivalent to an Exponential
 The statement ba = c is equivalent to the statement log b (c) = a .

Alternatively, we could show this by starting with the exponential function c = ba , then
taking the log base b of both sides, giving logb (c) = logb ba . Using the inverse property
of logs, we see that logb (c) = a .

Since log is a function, it is most correctly written as log b (c) , using parentheses to
denote function evaluation, just as we would with f(c). However, when the input is a
single variable or number, it is common to see the parentheses dropped and the
expression written as log b c .

Example 1

Write these exponential equations as logarithmic equations:

a) 23 = 8            is equivalent to log 2 (8) = 3

1. Write the exponential equation 42 = 16 as a logarithmic equation.
                                                         Section 4.3 Logarithmic Functions 279

By establishing the relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions, we can
now solve basic logarithmic and exponential equations by rewriting.

Example 3

 Solve log 4 (x) = 2 for x.

 By rewriting this expression as an exponential, 42 = x , so x = 16.

Example 4
 Solve 2 x = 10 for x.

 By rewriting this expression as a logarithm, we get x = log 2 (10) .

While this does define a solution, and an exact solution at that, you may find it somewhat
unsatisfying since it is difficult to compare this expression to the decimal estimate we
made earlier. Also, giving an exact expression for a solution is not always useful - often
we really need a decimal approximation to the solution. Luckily, this is a task calculators
and computers are quite adept at. Unluckily for us, most calculators and computers will
only evaluate logarithms of two bases. Happily, this ends up not being a problem, as
we'll see briefly.

Common and Natural Logarithms
The common log is the logarithm with base 10, and is typically written log( x) .
The natural log is the logarithm with base e, and is typically written ln( x) .

Example 5                                         Values of the common log
 Evaluate log(1000 ) using the definition of the
 common log.                                      number number as log(number)

 To evaluate log(1000 ) , we can let                   exponential
  x = log(1000 ) , then rewrite into exponential
 form using the common log base of 10:            1000 103               3
 10 x = 1000 .
                                                  100  102               2
 From this, we might recognize that 1000 is the
 cube of 10, so x = 3.                            10   101               1

                                                  1    100               0

                                                  0.1  10-1              -1

                                                  0.01 10-2              -2

                                                  0.001 10-3             -3

We also can use the inverse property of logs to write log 10(103 )= 3 .

2. Evaluate log(1000000 ) .

Example 6

 Evaluate ln ( e ).
 We can rewrite ln ( e ) as ln (e1/2 ). Since ln is a log base e, we can use the inverse

 property for logs: ln (e1/ 2 ) = log e (e1/ 2 ) = 1 .

                                                     2

Example 7
 Evaluate log(500) using your calculator or computer.
 Using a computer, we can evaluate log( 500)  2.69897

To utilize the common or natural logarithm functions to evaluate expressions like
log 2 (10) , we need to establish some additional properties.

 Properties of Logs: Exponent Property

 log b (Ar ) = r log b (A)

To show why this is true, we offer a proof:
    Since the logarithmic and exponential functions are inverses, blogb A = A .

  Raising both sides to the r power, we get Ar = (blogb A )r .
  Utilizing the exponential rule that states ( x p )q = x pq , Ar = (blogb A )r = br logb A
  Taking the log of both sides, log b (Ar ) = ( log b br logb A )

  Utilizing the inverse property on the right side yields the result: log b (Ar ) = r log b A

Example 8

 Rewrite log 3 (25) using the exponent property for logs.

 Since 25 = 52,

 log 3 (25) = log 3 (52 ) = 2 log 3 (5)
                                                         Section 4.3 Logarithmic Functions 281

Example 9
 Rewrite 4 ln( x) using the exponent property for logs.

 Using the property in reverse, 4ln( x) = ln(x4 ).

Try it Now
                                                              1

3. Rewrite using the exponent property for logs: ln  2  .
                                                              x 

The exponent property allows us to find a method for changing the base of a logarithmic
expression.

 Properties of Logs: Change of Base

 log b (A) = log c ( A)

               log c (b)

Proof:

   Let log b (A) = x .

    Rewriting as an exponential gives b x = A .
    Taking the log base c of both sides of this equation gives log c b x = log c A ,
    Now utilizing the exponent property for logs on the left side, x log c b = log c A
    Dividing, we obtain x = log c A . Replacing our original expression for x,

                                    log c b
     log b A = log c A

                 log c b

With this change of base formula, we can finally find a good decimal approximation to
our question from the beginning of the section.

Example 10
 Evaluate log 2 (10) using the change of base formula.

 According to the change of base formula, we can rewrite the log base 2 as a logarithm
 of any other base. Since our calculators can evaluate the natural log, we might choose
 to use the natural logarithm, which is the log base e:
282 Chapter 4

  log 2 10 = log e 10 = ln 10
               log e 2 ln 2

 Using our calculators to evaluate this,
  ln 10  2.30259  3.3219
   ln 2 0.69315

 This finally allows us to answer our original question - the population of flies we
 discussed at the beginning of the section will take 3.32 weeks to grow to 500.

Example 11
 Evaluate log 5 (100) using the change of base formula.

 We can rewrite this expression using any other base. If our calculators are able to
 evaluate the common logarithm, we could rewrite using the common log, base 10.
  log 5 (100) = log 10 100  2 = 2.861

                   log 10 5 0.69897

While we can solve the basic exponential equation 2 x = 10 by rewriting in logarithmic
form and then using the change of base formula to evaluate the logarithm, the proof of
the change of base formula illuminates an alternative approach to solving exponential
equations.

 Solving exponential equations:
 1. Isolate the exponential expressions when possible
 2. Take the logarithm of both sides
 3. Utilize the exponent property for logarithms to pull the variable out of the

      exponent
 4. Use algebra to solve for the variable.

Example 12
 Solve 2 x = 10 for x.

 Using this alternative approach, rather than rewrite this exponential into logarithmic
 form, we will take the logarithm of both sides of the equation. Since we often wish to
 evaluate the result to a decimal answer, we will usually utilize either the common log or
 natural log. For this example, we'll use the natural log:
                                               Section 4.3 Logarithmic Functions 283

ln(2x ) = ln(10)           Utilizing the exponent property for logs,
                           Now dividing by ln(2),
xln(2) = ln(10)

x = ln(10)  3.3219

    ln (2)

Notice that this result matches the result we found using the change of base formula.

Example 13
 In the first section, we predicted the population (in billions) of India t years after 2008
 by using the function f (t) = 1.14(1+ 0.0134 )t . If the population continues following

 this trend, when will the population reach 2 billion?

We need to solve for time t so that f(t) = 2.

2 = 1.14(1.0134 )t         Divide by 1.14 to isolate the exponential expression

  2 = 1.0134 t             Take the logarithm of both sides of the equation
1.14

2
ln  = ln (1.0134 )  t      Apply the exponent property on the right side

1.14 

  2                        Divide both sides by ln(1.0134)

ln  = t ln (1.0134 )

  1.14 

       2
     ln 
t = 1.14   42.23 years

   ln(1.0134 )

If this growth rate continues, the model predicts the population of India will reach 2
billion about 42 years after 2008, or approximately in the year 2050.

4. Solve 5(0.93) x = 10 .

Example 14
 Solve 5(1.07)3t = 2

 To start, we want to isolate the exponential part of the expression, the (1.07)3t , so it is
 alone on one side of the equation. Then we can use the log to solve the equation. We
 can use any base log; this time we'll use the common log.
284 Chapter 4

5(1.07)3t = 2                       Divide both sides by 5 to isolate the exponential
                                    Take the log of both sides.
(1.07)3t = 2                        Use the exponent property for logs
            5
                                    Divide by 3log(1.07) on both sides
                  2
log ((1.07) ) = log  3t             Simplify and evaluate

                  5

                     2

          2
      log  
t =  5   -4.5143

   3log (1.07)

Note that when entering that expression on your calculator, be sure to put parentheses
around the whole denominator to ensure the proper order of operations:
log(2/5)/(3*log(1.07))

In addition to solving exponential equations, logarithmic expressions are common in
many physical situations.

Example 15

 In chemistry, pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a liquid. The pH is related to
 the concentration of hydrogen ions, [H+], measured in moles per liter, by the equation

 pH = -log(H + ) .

 If a liquid has concentration of 0.0001 moles per liber, determine the pH.
 Determine the hydrogen ion concentration of a liquid with pH of 7.

To answer the first question, we evaluate the expression - log(0.0001). While we could

use our calculators for this, we do not really need them here, since we can use the
inverse property of logs:

- log (0.0001) = -log (10-4 ) = -(-4) = 4

To answer the second question, we need to solve the equation 7 = -log (H + ) . Begin

by isolating the logarithm on one side of the equation by multiplying both sides by -1:

-7 = log (H + ) . Rewriting into exponential form yields the answer:

H +    = 10-7  =  0.0000001  moles  per  liter.

                                                         Section 4.3 Logarithmic Functions 285

Logarithms also provide us a mechanism for finding continuous growth models for
exponential growth given two data points.

Example 15
 A population grows from 100 to 130 in 2 weeks. Find the continuous growth rate.

Measuring t in weeks, we are looking for an equation P(t) = aert so that P(0) = 100 and

P(2) = 130. Using the first pair of values,
100 = aer0 , so a = 100.

Using the second pair of values,

130 = 100er2         Divide by 100

130 = er2            Take the natural log of both sides
100                  Use the inverse property of logs

ln(1.3) = ln(er2 )

ln(1.3) = 2r

r = ln(1.3)  0.1312
        2

This population is growing at a continuous rate of 13.12% per week.

In general, we can relate the standard form of an exponential with the continuous growth
form by noting (using k to represent the continuous growth rate to avoid the confusion of
using r in two different ways in the same formula):
a(1 + r) x = aekx

(1 + r) x = ekx

1+ r = ek

Converting Between Periodic to Continuous Growth Rate
In the equation f (x) = a(1+ r)x , r is the periodic growth rate, the percent growth
each time period (weekly growth, annual growth, etc.).

In the equation f (x) = aekx , k is the continuous growth rate.

You can convert between these using: 1 + r = ek .

Remember that the continuous growth rate k represents the nominal growth rate before
accounting for the effects of continuous compounding, while r represents the actual
percent increase in one time unit (one week, one year, etc.).
286 Chapter 4

Example 16
 A company's sales can be modeled by the function S(t) = 5000 e0.12t , with t measured in
 years. Find the annual growth rate.

 Noting that 1 + r = ek , then r = e0.12 -1 = 0.1275 , so the annual growth rate is 12.75%.
 The sales function could also be written in the form S(t) = 5000 (1+ 0.1275)t .

Section 4.4 Logarithmic Properties

In the previous section, we derived two important properties of logarithms, which
allowed us to solve some basic exponential and logarithmic equations.

 Properties of Logs
 Inverse Properties:

 log b (b x ) = x

  b logb x = x

 Exponential Property:

 log b (Ar ) = r log b (A)

 Change of Base:

 log b (A) = log c ( A)

               log c (b)

While these properties allow us to solve a large number of problems, they are not
sufficient to solve all problems involving exponential and logarithmic equations.

 Properties of Logs
 Sum of Logs Property:

 log b (A) + log b (C) = log b (AC)

 Difference of Logs Property:
                                 A

 log b (A) - log b (C ) = log b  

                                C

It's just as important to know what properties logarithms do not satisfy as to memorize
the valid properties listed above. In particular, the logarithm is not a linear function,
which means that it does not distribute: log(A + B)  log(A) + log(B).
To help in this process we offer a proof to help solidify our new rules and show how they
follow from properties you've already seen.
290 Chapter 4

Let a = log b (A) and c = log b (C).

By definition of the logarithm, ba = A and bc = C .
Using these expressions, AC = babc
Using exponent rules on the right, AC = ba+c
Taking the log of both sides, and utilizing the inverse property of logs,

log b (AC ) = log b (ba+c ) = a + c

Replacing a and c with their definition establishes the result

log b (AC) = log b A + log b C

The proof for the difference property is very similar.

With these properties, we can rewrite expressions involving multiple logs as a single log,
or break an expression involving a single log into expressions involving multiple logs.

Example 1

 Write log 3 (5) + log 3 (8) - log 3 (2) as a single logarithm.

 Using the sum of logs property on the first two terms,

 log 3 (5) + log 3 (8) = log 3 (58) = log 3 (40)

 This reduces our original expression to log 3 (40) - log 3 (2)

 Then using the difference of logs property,
                                  40 

 log 3 (40) - log 3 (2) = log 3   = log 3 (20)

                                 2

Example 2

 Evaluate 2log(5)+ log(4) without a calculator by first rewriting as a single logarithm.

 On the first term, we can use the exponent property of logs to write

 2log (5) = log (52 ) = log (25)

 With the expression reduced to a sum of two logs, log(25)+ log(4), we can utilize the

 sum of logs property

 log(25)+ log(4) = log(4 25) = log(100)

 Since 100 = 102, we can evaluate this log without a calculator:

 log(100) = log (102 ) = 2
                                                         Section 4.4 Logarithmic Properties 291

1. Without a calculator evaluate by first rewriting as a single logarithm:

  log 2 (8)+ log 2 (4)

Example 3
                x4y 

 Rewrite ln   as a sum or difference of logs
               7

 First, noticing we have a quotient of two expressions, we can utilize the difference
 property of logs to write

 ln    x  = ln 4 y  (x4 y)- ln( 7)

    7

 Then seeing the product in the first term, we use the sum property

 ln(x4 y)- ln( 7) = ln(x4 )+ ln( y) - ln( 7)

 Finally, we could use the exponent property on the first term

 ln (x4 )+ ln( y) - ln( 7) = 4ln( x) + ln( y) - ln( 7)

Interestingly, solving exponential equations was not the reason        value   log(value)
logarithms were originally developed. Historically, up until the            1  0.0000000
advent of calculators and computers, the power of logarithms was            2  0.3010300
that these log properties reduced multiplication, division, roots, or       3  0.4771213
powers to be evaluated using addition, subtraction, division and            4  0.6020600
multiplication, respectively, which are much easier to compute              5  0.6989700
without a calculator. Large books were published listing the                6  0.7781513
logarithms of numbers, such as in the table to the right. To find           7  0.8450980
the product of two numbers, the sum of log property was used.               8  0.9030900
Suppose for example we didn't know the value of 2 times 3.                  9  0.9542425
Using the sum property of logs:                                                1.0000000
                                                                          10
log( 2  3) = log( 2) + log( 3)

Using the log table,
log( 2  3) = log( 2) + log( 3) = 0.3010300 + 0.4771213 = 0.7781513

We can then use the table again in reverse, looking for 0.7781513 as an output of the
logarithm. From that we can determine:
log( 2  3) = 0.7781513 = log( 6) .

By using addition and the table of logs, we were able to determine 2  3 = 6 .
292 Chapter 4

Likewise, to compute a cube root like 3 8

log( 3 8) == log (81/ 3 ) = 1 log( 8) = 1 (0.9030900 ) = 0.3010300 = log( 2)
               3  3

So 3 8 = 2 .

Although these calculations are simple and insignificant, they illustrate the same idea that
was used for hundreds of years as an efficient way to calculate the product, quotient,
roots, and powers of large and complicated numbers, either using tables of logarithms or
mechanical tools called slide rules.

These properties still have other practical applications for interpreting changes in
exponential and logarithmic relationships.

Example 4

 Recall that in chemistry, pH = -log(H + ) . If the concentration of hydrogen ions in a

 liquid is doubled, what is the affect on pH?

 Suppose C is the original concentration of hydrogen ions, and P is the original pH of the

 liquid, so P = -log(C). If the concentration is doubled, the new concentration is 2C.

 Then the pH of the new liquid is

 pH = -log(2C)

 Using the sum property of logs,

 pH = -log(2C) = -(log(2) + log(C)) = -log(2) - log(C)

 Since P = -log(C), the new pH is

  pH = P - log( 2) = P - 0.301

 When the concentration of hydrogen ions is doubled, the pH decreases by 0.301.

Log properties in solving equations

The logarithm properties often arise when solving problems involving logarithms. First,
we'll look at a simpler log equation.

Example 5
 Solve log( 2x - 6) = 3.

 To solve for x, we need to get it out from inside the log function. There are two ways
 we can approach this.
                                           Section 4.4 Logarithmic Properties 293

Method 1: Rewrite as an exponential.

Recall that since the common log is base 10, log( A) = B can be rewritten as the
exponential 10 B = A . Likewise, log( 2x - 6) = 3 can be rewritten in exponential form as
10 3 = 2x - 6

Method 2: Exponentiate both sides.

If A = B , then 10 A = 10 B . Using this idea, since log( 2x - 6) = 3 , then 10 log(2x-6) = 103 .
Use the inverse property of logs to rewrite the left side and get 2x - 6 = 103 .

Using either method, we now need to solve 2x - 6 = 103 . Evaluate 10 3 to get

2x - 6 = 1000      Add 6 to both sides

2x = 1006          Divide both sides by 2

x = 503

Occasionally the solving process will result in extraneous solutions - answers that are
outside the domain of the original equation. In this case, our answer looks fine.

Example 6
 Solve log( 50 x + 25) - log( x) = 2 .

In order to rewrite in exponential form, we need a single logarithmic expression on the

left side of the equation. Using the difference property of logs, we can rewrite the left

side:

 50 x + 25 
log            =2
x

Rewriting in exponential form reduces this to an algebraic equation:

50 x + 25 = 10 2 = 100                  Multiply both sides by x
    x

50x + 25 = 100 x                        Combine like terms

25 = 50x                                Divide by 50

x = 25 = 1
     50 2

Checking this answer in the original equation, we can verify there are no domain issues,
and this answer is correct.

2. Solve log( x2 - 4) = 1+ log( x + 2) .
294 Chapter 4

Example 7
 Solve ln( x + 2) + ln( x +1) = ln( 4x +14) .

ln( x + 2) + ln( x +1) = ln( 4x +14)           Use the sum of logs property on the right
                                               Expand
ln((x + 2)(x +1)) = ln( 4x +14)

ln(x2 + 3x + 2)= ln( 4x +14)

We have a log on both side of the equation this time. Rewriting in exponential form

would be tricky, so instead we can exponentiate both sides.

eln(x2 +3x+2) = eln(4x+14)                     Use the inverse property of logs

x2 + 3x + 2 = 4x +14                           Move terms to one side

x2 - x -12 = 0                                 Factor

(x - 4)(x + 3) = 0

x = 4 or x = -3.

Checking our answers, notice that evaluating the original equation at x = -3 would
result in us evaluating ln(-1) , which is undefined. That answer is outside the domain

of the original equation, so it is an extraneous solution and we discard it. There is one
solution: x = 4.

More complex exponential equations can often be solved in more than one way. In the
following example, we will solve the same problem in two ways - one using logarithm
properties, and the other using exponential properties.

Example 8a
 In 2008, the population of Kenya was approximately 38.8 million, and was growing by
 2.64% each year, while the population of Sudan was approximately 41.3 million and
 growing by 2.24% each year2. If these trends continue, when will the population of
 Kenya match that of Sudan?

 We start by writing an equation for each population in terms of t, the number of years
 after 2008.
  Kenya(t) = 38.8(1+ 0.0264)t
  Sudan(t) = 41.3(1+ 0.0224)t

 To find when the populations will be equal, we can set the equations equal
  38.8(1.0264)t = 41.3(1.0224)t

For our first approach, we take the log of both sides of the equation.

log (38.8(1.0264)t ) = log (41.3(1.0224)t )

Utilizing the sum property of logs, we can rewrite each side,

log(38.8) + log (1.0264t ) = log(41.3) + log (1.0224t )

Then utilizing the exponent property, we can pull the variables out of the exponent

log(38.8) + t log (1.0264) = log(41.3) + t log (1.0224)

Moving all the terms involving t to one side of the equation and the rest of the terms to
the other side,

t log (1.0264) - t log (1.0224) = log(41.3) - log(38.8)

Factoring out the t on the left,

t (log (1.0264) - log (1.0224)) = log(41.3) - log(38.8)

Dividing to solve for t
t = log(41.3) - log(38.8) 15.991years until the populations will be equal.

   log(1.0264) - log (1.0224)

Example 8b
 Solve the problem above by rewriting before taking the log.

Starting at the equation
38.8(1.0264)t = 41.3(1.0224)t

Divide to move the exponential terms to one side of the equation and the constants to
the other side
1.0264t = 41.3
1.0224t 38.8

Using exponent rules to group on the left,

 1.0264 t 41.3
       =
 1.0224  38.8

Taking the log of both sides

    1.0264 t     41.3 
log         = log  
    1.0224    38.8 
296 Chapter 4

Utilizing the exponent property on the left,

       1.0264   41.3 
t log        = log  
       1.0224   38.8 

Dividing gives

           41.3 
      log  
t=         38.8      15.991 years

         1.0264 
    log           
         1.0224 

While the answer does not immediately appear identical to that produced using the

previous method, note that by using the difference property of logs, the answer could be

rewritten:

           41.3 
      log  
t=         38.8     =  log(41.3) - log(38.8)

         1.0264  log(1.0264) - log(1.0224)
    log           
         1.0224 

While both methods work equally well, it often requires fewer steps to utilize algebra
before taking logs, rather than relying solely on log properties.

In this second table, notice that
    1) As the input increases, the output increases.
    2) As input increases, the output increases more slowly.
    3) Since the exponential function only outputs positive values, the logarithm can
         only accept positive values as inputs, so the domain of the log function is (0, ) .

    4) Since the exponential function can accept all real numbers as inputs, the logarithm
         can output any real number, so the range is all real numbers or (-, ) .

Sketching the graph, notice that as the input
approaches zero from the right, the output of the
function grows very large in the negative direction,
indicating a vertical asymptote at
x = 0.
In symbolic notation we write
as x  0+ , f (x)  - , and as x  , f (x)

When sketching a general logarithm with base b, it can be helpful to remember that the
graph will pass through the points (1, 0) and (b, 1).
To get a feeling for how the base affects the shape of the graph, examine the graphs
below.

Notice that the larger the base, the slower the graph grows. For example, the common
log graph, while it grows without bound, it does so very slowly. For example, to reach an
output of 8, the input must be 100,000,000.

Another important observation made was the domain of the logarithm. Like the
reciprocal and square root functions, the logarithm has a restricted domain which must be
considered when finding the domain of a composition involving a log.

Example 1
 Find the domain of the function f (x) = log( 5 - 2x)

The logarithm is only defined with the input is positive, so this function will only be
defined when 5 - 2x  0 . Solving this inequality,
- 2x  -5

1. Find the domain of the function f (x) = log( x - 5) + 2 ; before solving this as an

   inequality, consider how the function has been transformed.
302 Chapter 4

Transformations of the Logarithmic Function
Transformations can be applied to a logarithmic function using the basic transformation
techniques, but as with exponential functions, several transformations result in interesting
relationships.
First recall the change of base property tells us that log b x = log c x = 1 log c x

                                                                        log c b log c b
From this, we can see that log b x is a vertical stretch or compression of the graph of the
log c x graph. This tells us that a vertical stretch or compression is equivalent to a change
of base. For this reason, we typically represent all graphs of logarithmic functions in
terms of the common or natural log functions.
Next, consider the effect of a horizontal compression on the graph of a logarithmic
function. Considering f (x) = log( cx) , we can use the sum property to see
 f (x) = log( cx) = log( c) + log( x)
Since log(c) is a constant, the effect of a horizontal compression is the same as the effect
of a vertical shift.

Example 2
 Sketch f (x) = ln( x) and g(x) = ln( x) + 2 .
 Graphing these,

 Note that this vertical shift could also be written as a horizontal compression, since
  g(x) = ln( x) + 2 = ln( x) + ln( e2 ) = ln( e2 x) .

While a horizontal stretch or compression can be written as a vertical shift, a horizontal
reflection is unique and separate from vertical shifting.
Finally, we will consider the effect of a horizontal shift on the graph of a logarithm.
                                               Section 4.5 Graphs of Logarithmic Functions 303

Example 3
 Sketch a graph of f (x) = ln( x + 2) .
 This is a horizontal shift to the left by 2 units. Notice that none of our logarithm rules
 allow us rewrite this in another form, so the effect of this transformation is unique.
 Shifting the graph,

 Notice that due to the horizontal shift, the vertical asymptote shifted to x = -2, and the
 domain shifted to (-2, ) .

Combining these transformations,

Example 4
 Sketch a graph of f (x) = 5log( -x + 2) .
 Factoring the inside as f (x) = 5log( -(x - 2)) reveals that this graph is that of the
 common logarithm, horizontally reflected, vertically stretched by a factor of 5, and
 shifted to the right by 2 units.
 The vertical asymptote will be shifted to x = 2,
 and the graph will have domain (, 2) . A rough
 sketch can be created by using the vertical
 asymptote along with a couple points on the
 graph, such as
  f (1) = 5log( -1 + 2) = 5log(1) = 0
  f (-8) = 5log( -(-8) + 2) = 5log(10) = 5

2. Sketch a graph of the function f (x) = -3log( x - 2) + 1.

 Transformations of Logs
 Any transformed logarithmic function can be written in the form

 f (x) = a log(x - b) + k , or f (x) = a log (- ( x - b)) + k if horizontally reflected,

 where x = b is the vertical asymptote.

Example 5
 Find an equation for the logarithmic function
 graphed.

 This graph has a vertical asymptote at x = -2 and
 has been vertically reflected. We do not know yet
 the vertical shift (equivalent to horizontal stretch)
 or the vertical stretch (equivalent to a change of
 base). We know so far that the equation will have
 form
  f (x) = -a log( x + 2) + k

 It appears the graph passes through the points (-1, 1) and (2, -1). Substituting in (-1, 1),
 1 = -a log( -1 + 2) + k
 1 = -a log(1) + k
 1= k

 Next, substituting in (2, -1),
  -1 = -a log( 2 + 2) + 1
  - 2 = -a log( 4)
  a= 2

       log( 4)

 This gives us the equation f (x) = - 2 log( x + 2) +1.
                                             log( 4)

 This could also be written as f (x) = -2log4(x + 2) +1.

Section 4.6 Exponential and Logarithmic Models

While we have explored some basic applications of exponential and logarithmic
functions, in this section we explore some important applications in more depth.

Radioactive Decay

In an earlier section, we discussed radioactive decay - the idea that radioactive isotopes
change over time. One of the common terms associated with radioactive decay is half-
life.

Half Life

The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half the substance to
decay.

Given the basic exponential growth/decay equation h(t) = abt , half-life can be found by
solving for when half the original amount remains; by solving 1 a = a(b)t , or more

                                                                                2
simply 1 = bt . Notice how the initial amount is irrelevant when solving for half-life.

          2

Example 1
 Bismuth-210 is an isotope that decays by about 13% each day. What is the half-life of
 Bismuth-210?

We were not given a starting quantity, so we could either make up a value or use an
unknown constant to represent the starting amount. To show that starting quantity does
not affect the result, let us denote the initial quantity by the constant a. Then the decay
of Bismuth-210 can be described by the equation Q(d) = a(0.87)d .

To find the half-life, we want to determine when the remaining quantity is half the

original: 1 a . Solving,
            2

1 a = a(0.87)d            Divide by a,
2

1 = 0.87 d                Take the log of both sides
2

1
log   = log (0.87 )d      Use the exponent property of logs

2
                        Section 4.6 Exponential and Logarithmic Models 309

    1                   Divide to solve for d

log   = d log (0.87)

    2

          1
      log  
d =  2   4.977 days

   log (0.87)

This tells us that the half-life of Bismuth-210 is approximately 5 days.

Example 2
 Cesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years. If you begin with 200mg of cesium-137,
 how much will remain after 30 years? 60 years? 90 years?

 Since the half-life is 30 years, after 30 years, half the original amount, 100mg, will
 remain.

 After 60 years, another 30 years have passed, so during that second 30 years, another
 half of the substance will decay, leaving 50mg.

 After 90 years, another 30 years have passed, so another half of the substance will
 decay, leaving 25mg.

Example 3
 Cesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years. Find the annual decay rate.

Since we are looking for an annual decay rate, we will use an equation of the form
Q(t) = a(1+ r)t . We know that after 30 years, half the original amount will remain.

Using this information

1 a = a(1 + r)30  Dividing by a
2

1 = (1 + r)30     Taking the 30th root of both sides
2

30 1 = 1+ r       Subtracting one from both sides,
  2

r = 30 1 -1  -0.02284
       2

This tells us cesium-137 is decaying at an annual rate of 2.284% per year.

Example 4
 Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope that is present in organic materials, and is commonly
 used for dating historical artifacts. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 years. If a bone
 fragment is found that contains 20% of its original carbon-14, how old is the bone?

To find how old the bone is, we first will need to find an equation for the decay of the
carbon-14. We could either use a continuous or annual decay formula, but opt to use
the continuous decay formula since it is more common in scientific texts. The half life
tells us that after 5730 years, half the original substance remains. Solving for the rate,

1 a = aer5730         Dividing by a
2

1 = er5730            Taking the natural log of both sides
2

1
ln  = ln (e )
               r5730  Use the inverse property of logs on the right side

2

  1                   Divide by 5730
ln   = 5730 r

  2

       1
    ln  
r =  2   -0.000121
     5730

Now we know the decay will follow the equation Q(t) = ae-0.000121t . To find how old

the bone fragment is that contains 20% of the original amount, we solve for t so that
Q(t) = 0.20a.

0.20a = ae-0.000121t           years
0.20 = e -0.000121t

ln( 0.20) = ln (e-0.000121t )

ln( 0.20) = -0.000121 t

t = ln( 0.20)  13301
    - 0.000121

The bone fragment is about 13,300 years old.

   milligram remains?

Doubling Time

For decaying quantities, we asked how long it takes for half the substance to decay. For
growing quantities we might ask how long it takes for the quantity to double.

 Doubling Time
 The doubling time of a growing quantity is the time it takes for the quantity to
 double.

Given the basic exponential growth equation h(t) = abt , doubling time can be found by
solving for when the original quantity has doubled; by solving 2a = a(b) x , or more
simply 2 = b x . Like with decay, the initial amount is irrelevant when solving for
doubling time.

Example 5
 Cancer cells sometimes increase exponentially. If a cancerous growth contained 300
 cells last month and 360 cells this month, how long will it take for the number of cancer
 cells to double?

 Defining t to be time in months, with t = 0 corresponding to this month, we are given
 two pieces of data: this month, (0, 360), and last month, (-1, 300).

 From this data, we can find an equation for the growth. Using the form C(t) = abt , we
 know immediately a = 360, giving C(t) = 360bt . Substituting in (-1, 300),
  300 = 360b-1
  300 = 360

           b
  b = 360 = 1.2

       300

 This gives us the equation C(t) = 360(1.2)t

 To find the doubling time, we look for the time when we will have twice the original
 amount, so when C(t) = 2a.
312 Chapter 4

2a = a(1.2)t           months for the number of cancer cells to double.

2 = (1.2)t

log (2) = log (1.2t )

log(2) = t log(1.2)
t = log (2)  3.802

   log (1.2)

Example 6
 Use of a new social networking website has been growing exponentially, with the
 number of new members doubling every 5 months. If the site currently has 120,000
 users and this trend continues, how many users will the site have in 1 year?

 We can use the doubling time to find a function that models the number of site users,
 and then use that equation to answer the question. While we could use an arbitrary a as
 we have before for the initial amount, in this case, we know the initial amount was
 120,000.

 If we use a continuous growth equation, it would look like N(t) = 120ert , measured in
 thousands of users after t months. Based on the doubling time, there would be 240
 thousand users after 5 months. This allows us to solve for the continuous growth rate:
  240 = 120er5
  2 = er5

  ln 2 = 5r
  r = ln 2  0.1386

        5

 Now that we have an equation, N(t) = 120e0.1386t , we can predict the number of users
 after 12 months:
  N(12) = 120e0.1386(12) = 633.140 thousand users.

 So after 1 year, we would expect the site to have around 633,140 users.

Newton's Law of Cooling

When a hot object is left in surrounding air that is at a lower temperature, the object's
temperature will decrease exponentially, leveling off towards the surrounding air
temperature. This "leveling off" will correspond to a horizontal asymptote in the graph
of the temperature function. Unless the room temperature is zero, this will correspond to
a vertical shift of the generic exponential decay function.

 Newton's Law of Cooling
 The temperature of an object, T, in surrounding air with temperature Ts will behave
 according to the formula
  T (t) = aekt + Ts

 Where
 t is time
 a is a constant determined by the initial temperature of the object
 k is a constant, the continuous rate of cooling of the object

While an equation of the form T (t) = abt + Ts could be used, the continuous growth form
is more common.

Example 7
 A cheesecake is taken out of the oven with an ideal internal temperature of 165 degrees
 Fahrenheit, and is placed into a 35 degree refrigerator. After 10 minutes, the
 cheesecake has cooled to 150 degrees. If you must wait until the cheesecake has cooled
 to 70 degrees before you eat it, how long will you have to wait?

 Since the surrounding air temperature in the refrigerator is 35 degrees, the cheesecake's
 temperature will decay exponentially towards 35, following the equation
  T (t) = aekt + 35

 We know the initial temperature was 165, so T (0) = 165 . Substituting in these values,
  165 = aek0 + 35
  165 = a + 35
  a = 130
314 Chapter 4

 We were given another pair of data, T (10) = 150 , which we can use to solve for k
  150 = 130ek10 + 35
 115 = 130 ek10
  115 = e10k
  130

     115 
  ln   = 10k

    130 
          115 

       ln  
  k = 130  = -0.0123

          10

 Together this gives us the equation for cooling: T (t) = 130e-0.0123t + 35 .
 Now we can solve for the time it will take for the temperature to cool to 70 degrees.
  70 = 130 e -0.0123t + 35
  35 = 130 e-0.0123t
   35 = e-0.0123t
  130

     35 
  ln  = -0.0123t

  t = 130   106.68

 It will take about 107 minutes, or one hour and 47 minutes, for the cheesecake to cool.
 Of course, if you like your cheesecake served chilled, you'd have to wait a bit longer.

Logarithmic Scales

For quantities that vary greatly in magnitude, a standard scale of measurement is not
always effective, and utilizing logarithms can make the values more manageable. For
example, if the average distances from the sun to the major bodies in our solar system are
listed, you see they vary greatly.

Notice that on the log scale above Example 8, the visual distance on the scale between
points A and B and between C and D is the same. When looking at the values these
points correspond to, notice B is ten times the value of A, and D is ten times the value of
C. A visual linear difference between points corresponds to a relative (ratio) change
between the corresponding values.

Logarithms are useful for showing these relative changes. For example, comparing
$1,000,000 to $10,000, the first is 100 times larger than the second.
1,000,000 = 100 = 10 2

  10,000

Likewise, comparing $1000 to $10, the first is 100 times larger than the second.
1,000 = 100 = 10 2

  10

When one quantity is roughly ten times larger than another, we say it is one order of
magnitude larger. In both cases described above, the first number was two orders of
magnitude larger than the second.

Notice that the order of magnitude can be found as the common logarithm of the ratio of
the quantities. On the log scale above, B is one order of magnitude larger than A, and D
is one order of magnitude larger than C.

Orders of Magnitude

Given two values A and B, to determine how many orders of magnitude A is greater
than B,

                                                  A
Difference in orders of magnitude = log  

                                                 B

Example 10
 On the log scale above Example 8, how many orders of magnitude larger is C than B?

 The value B corresponds to 10 2 = 100
 The value C corresponds to 105 = 100,000

                        100,000  10 3 5
The relative change is           = 1000 = 2 = 10 . The log of this value is 3.
                        100      10

C is three orders of magnitude greater than B, which can be seen on the log scale by the

visual difference between the points on the scale.

6. Using the table from Try it Now #5, what is the difference of order of magnitude

   between the softest sound a human can hear and the launching of the space shuttle?

Earthquakes

An example of a logarithmic scale is the Moment Magnitude Scale (MMS) used for
earthquakes. This scale is commonly and mistakenly called the Richter Scale, which was
a very similar scale succeeded by the MMS.

 Moment Magnitude Scale
 For an earthquake with seismic moment S, a measurement of earth movement, the
 MMS value, or magnitude of the earthquake, is

        2 S
  M = log  

        3  S0 
 Where S0 = 1016 is a baseline measure for the seismic moment.

Example 11
 If one earthquake has a MMS magnitude of 6.0, and another has a magnitude of 8.0,
 how much more powerful (in terms of earth movement) is the second earthquake?

 Since the first earthquake has magnitude 6.0, we can find the amount of earth
 movement for that quake, which we'll denote S1. The value of S0 is not particularly
 relevant, so we will not replace it with its value.
  6.0 = 2 log    S1 

         3  S0 
      3   S1 
  6.0  = log  
      2   S0 
  9 = log    S1 

           S0 
  S1 = 109
  S0
  S1 = 10 9 S0

 This tells us the first earthquake has about 109 times more earth movement than the
 baseline measure.
                                      Section 4.6 Exponential and Logarithmic Models 319

Doing the same with the second earthquake, S2, with a magnitude of 8.0,
8.0 = 2 log    S2 

       3  S0 
S2 = 1012 S0

Comparing the earth movement of the second earthquake to the first,
S2 1012 S0 3

    = 9 = 10 = 1000
S1 10 S0

The second value's earth movement is 1000 times as large as the first earthquake.

Example 12
 One earthquake has magnitude of 3.0. If a second earthquake has twice as much earth
 movement as the first earthquake, find the magnitude of the second quake.

Since the first quake has magnitude 3.0,
       2 S

3.0 = log  
       3  S0 

Solving for S,

3  S 
3.0  = log  
2               S0 

          S
4.5 = log  

           S0 

10 4.5 = S
         S0

S = 10 4.5 S0

Since the second earthquake has twice as much earth movement, for the second quake,
S = 2 10 4.5 S0

Finding the magnitude,

2  2 10 4.5 S0 
M = log              
3  S0 

M = 2 log (2 10 4.5 )  3.201

      3

The second earthquake with twice as much earth movement will have a magnitude of
about 3.2.
320 Chapter 4

In fact, using log properties, we could show that whenever the earth movement doubles,
the magnitude will increase by about 0.201:

      2  2S  2  S 
M = log   = log  2  

      3  S0  3  S0 

M =  2 log( 2) + log    S 
3               S0 

2  2 S
M = log( 2) + log  
3  3  S0 

                2 S
M = 0.201 + log  

                3  S0 

This illustrates the most important feature of a log scale: that multiplying the quantity
being considered will add to the scale value, and vice versa.

35. Myoglobin and hemoglobin are oxygen-carrying molecules in the human body.
    Hemoglobin is found inside red blood cells, which flow from the lungs to the muscles

    half of the myoglobin (i.e. 50%) is oxygen saturated. (Note: More precisely, you need

Section 4.7 Fitting Exponential Models to Data

In the previous section, we saw number lines using logarithmic scales. It is also common
to see two dimensional graphs with one or both axes using a logarithmic scale.
One common use of a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis is to graph quantities that are
changing exponentially, since it helps reveal relative differences. This is commonly used
in stock charts, since values historically have grown exponentially over time. Both stock
charts below show the Dow Jones Industrial Average, from 1928 to 2010.

Both charts have a linear horizontal scale, but the first graph has a linear vertical scale,
while the second has a logarithmic vertical scale. The first scale is the one we are more
familiar with, and shows what appears to be a strong exponential trend, at least up until
the year 2000.
                                            Section 4.7 Fitting Exponential Models to Data 329

Example 1
 There were stock market drops in 1929 and 2008. Which was larger?

 In the first graph, the stock market drop around 2008 looks very large, and in terms of
 dollar values, it was indeed a large drop. However, the second graph shows relative
 changes, and the drop in 2009 seems less major on this graph, and in fact the drop
 starting in 1929 was, percentage-wise, much more significant.

 Specifically, in 2008, the Dow value dropped from about 14,000 to 8,000, a drop of
 6,000. This is obviously a large value drop, and amounts to about a 43% drop. In 1929,
 the Dow value dropped from a high of around 380 to a low of 42 by July of 1932.
 While value-wise this drop of 338 is much smaller than the 2008 drop, it corresponds to
 a 89% drop, a much larger relative drop than in 2008. The logarithmic scale shows
 these relative changes.

The second graph above, in which one axis uses a linear scale and the other axis uses a
logarithmic scale, is an example of a semi-log graph.

Semi-log and Log-log Graphs
A semi-log graph is a graph with one axis using a linear scale and one axis using a
logarithmic scale.

A log-log graph is a graph with both axes using logarithmic scales.

Example 2
 Plot 5 points on the graph of f (x) = 3(2)x on a semi-log graph with a logarithmic scale
 on the vertical axis.

 To do this, we need to find 5 points on the graph, then calculate the logarithm of the
 output value. Arbitrarily choosing 5 input values,

x  f(x)  log(f(x))

-3 3(2)-3 = 3 -0.426
                           8

-1 3(2)-1 = 3 0.176
                           2

0  3(2)0 = 3 0.477

2  3(2)2 = 12 1.079

5  3(2)5 = 96 1.982
330 Chapter 4
 Plotting these values on a semi-log graph,

Notice that on this semi-log scale, values from the exponential function appear linear.

We can show this behavior is expected by utilizing logarithmic properties. For the

function f (x) = abx , finding log(f(x)) gives

log ( f (x)) = log (abx )      Utilizing the sum property of logs,

log ( f (x)) = log (a) + log (bx ) Now utilizing the exponent property,

log( f (x)) = log(a)+ xlog(b)

This relationship is linear, with log(a) as the vertical intercept, and log(b) as the slope.
This relationship can also be utilized in reverse.

Example 3
 An exponential graph is plotted on semi-log axes. Find a formula for the exponential
 function g(x) that generated this graph.

The graph is linear, with vertical intercept at (0, 1). Looking at the change between the
points (0, 1) and (4, 4), we can determine the slope of the line is 3 . Since the output is

                                                                                  4

log(g(x)), this leads to the equation log (g(x)) = 1 + 3 x .

                                                                 4
                                  Section 4.7 Fitting Exponential Models to Data 331

We can solve this formula for g(x) by rewriting in exponential form and simplifying:

log (g(x)) = 1 + 3 x              Rewriting as an exponential,

                   4

                    1+ 3 x        Breaking this apart using exponent rules,

g(x) = 10 4

                              3x  Using exponent rules to group the second factor,

g(x) = 101 10 4

g(x) = 101  10 4 3  x             Evaluating the powers of 10,

Fitting Exponential Functions to Data

Some technology options provide dedicated functions for finding exponential functions
that fit data, but many only provide functions for fitting linear functions to data. The
semi-log scale provides us with a method to fit an exponential function to data by
building upon the techniques we have for fitting linear functions to data.

 To fit an exponential function to a set of data using linearization
 1. Find the log of the data output values
 2. Find the linear equation that fits the (input, log(output)) pairs. This equation will

      be of the form log(f(x)) = b + mx.
 3. Solve this equation for the exponential function f(x)

Example 4
 The table below shows the cost in dollars per megabyte of storage space on computer
 hard drives from 1980 to 2004, and the data is shown on a standard graph to the right,
 with the input changed to years after 1980.

        Year Cost per MB
        1980 192.31
        1984 87.86
        1988 15.98
        1992 4
        1996 0.173
        2000 0.006849
        2004 0.001149

This data appears to be decreasing exponentially. To find a function that models this
decay, we would start by finding the log of the costs.

Year t         Cost per MB  log(Cost)
1980 0         192.31       2.284002
1984 4         87.86        1.943791
1988 8         15.98        1.203577
1992 12        4            0.60206
1996 16        0.173        -0.76195
2000 20        0.006849     -2.16437
2004 24        0.001149     -2.93952

As hoped, the graph of the log of costs appears fairly linear, suggesting an exponential
function will fit the original data will fit reasonably well. Using technology, we can
find a linear equation to fit the log(Cost) values. Using t as years after 1980, linear
regression gives the equation:
log( C(t)) = 2.794 - 0.231t

Solving for C(t),
C(t) = 10 2.794-0.231t
C(t) = 10 2.794 10 -0.231t

C(t) = 10 2.794  (10 -0.231)t

C(t) = 622  (0.5877 )t

This equation suggests that the cost per megabyte for storage on computer hard drives is
decreasing by about 41% each year.

Using this function, we could predict the cost of storage in the future. Predicting the
cost in the year 2020 (t = 40):
                         Section 4.7 Fitting Exponential Models to Data 333

C(40) = 622(0.5877 )40  0.000000364 dollars per megabyte, a really small number.

That is equivalent to $0.36 per terabyte of hard drive storage.

Comparing the values predicted by this model to the actual data, we see the model
matches the original data in order of magnitude, but the specific values appear quite
different. This is, unfortunately, the best exponential model that can fit the data. It is
possible that a non-exponential model would fit the data better, or there could just be
wide enough variability in the data that no relatively simple model would fit the data
any better.

missing: the circle. We already know certain things about the circle, like how to find area
and circumference, and the relationship between radius and diameter, but now, in this
chapter, we explore the circle and its unique features that lead us into the rich world of
trigonometry.

Section 5.1 Circles

To begin, we need to find distances. Starting with the Pythagorean Theorem, which
relates the sides of a right triangle, we can find the distance between two points.

Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean Theorem states that the sum of the squares of the legs of a right

triangle will equal the square of the hypotenuse of the triangle.        c

                                                                   a

In graphical form, given the triangle shown, a2 + b2 = c2 .           b

We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between two points on a graph.

Example 1
 Find the distance between the points (-3, 2) and (2, 5).

 By plotting these points on the plane, we can then draw a
 right triangle with these points at each end of the
 hypotenuse. We can calculate horizontal width of the
 triangle to be 5 and the vertical height to be 3.

This chapter is part of Precalculus: An Investigation of Functions  Lippman & Rasmussen 2020.

338 Chapter 5

 From these we can find the distance between the points using the Pythagorean
 Theorem:
  dist 2 = 52 + 32 = 34
  dist = 34

Notice that the width of the triangle was calculated using the difference between the x
(input) values of the two points, and the height of the triangle was found using the
difference between the y (output) values of the two points. Generalizing this process
gives us the distance formula.

 Distance Formula
 The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2 , y2 ) can be calculated as
  dist = (x2 - x1 )2 + ( y2 - y1 )2

                                                              r
If we wanted to find an equation to represent a circle with
a radius of r centered at a point (h, k), we notice that the  (h, k)
distance between any point (x, y) on the circle and the
center point is always the same: r. Noting this, we can
use our distance formula to write an equation for the
radius:
r = (x - h)2 + ( y - k)2

Squaring both sides of the equation gives us the standard equation for a circle.

Equation of a Circle
The equation of a circle centered at the point (h, k) with radius r can be written as
(x - h)2 + ( y - k)2 = r 2

Notice that a circle does not pass the vertical line test. It is not possible to write y as a
function of x or vice versa.
                                                                 Section 5.1 Circles 339

Example 2
 Write an equation for a circle centered at the point (-3, 2) with radius 4.

Using the equation from above, h = -3, k = 2, and the radius r = 4. Using these in our

formula,

(x - (-3))2 + ( y - 2)2 = 42  simplified, this gives

(x + 3)2 + ( y - 2)2 = 16

Example 3
 Write an equation for the circle graphed here.

This circle is centered at the origin, the point (0, 0). By

measuring horizontally or vertically from the center out to the

circle, we can see the radius is 3. Using this information in our

formula gives:

(x - 0)2 + ( y - 0)2 = 32     simplified, this gives

x2 + y2 = 9

2. Write an equation for a circle centered at (4, -2) with radius 6.

Notice that, relative to a circle centered at the origin, horizontal and vertical shifts of the
circle are revealed in the values of h and k, which are the coordinates for the center of the
circle.

Points on a Circle

As noted earlier, an equation for a circle cannot be written so that y is a function of x or
vice versa. To find coordinates on the circle given only the x or y value, we must solve
algebraically for the unknown values.

Example 4
 Find the points on a circle of radius 5 centered at the origin with an x value of 3.

 We begin by writing an equation for the circle centered at the origin with a radius of 5.
  x2 + y 2 = 25

 Substituting in the desired x value of 3 gives an equation we can solve for y.
340 Chapter 5

  32 + y 2 = 25
  y 2 = 25 - 9 = 16
  y =  16 = 4

 There are two points on the circle with an x value of 3: (3, 4) and (3, -4).

Example 5
 Find the x intercepts of a circle with radius 6 centered at the point (2, 4).

We can start by writing an equation for the circle.
(x - 2)2 + ( y - 4)2 = 36

To find the x intercepts, we need to find the points where y = 0.  Substituting in zero for
y, we can solve for x.
(x - 2)2 + (0 - 4)2 = 36

(x - 2)2 +16 = 36

(x - 2)2 = 20

x - 2 =  20

x = 2  20 = 2  2 5

The x intercepts of the circle are (2 + 2 5,0) and (2 - 2 5,0)

Example 6
 In a town, Main Street runs east to west, and Meridian Road runs north to south. A
 pizza store is located on Meridian 2 miles south of the intersection of Main and
 Meridian. If the store advertises that it delivers within a 3-mile radius, how much of
 Main Street do they deliver to?

 This type of question is one in which introducing a coordinate system and drawing a
 picture can help us solve the problem. We could
 either place the origin at the intersection of the two
 streets, or place the origin at the pizza store itself. It is
 often easier to work with circles centered at the origin,
 so we'll place the origin at the pizza store, though
 either approach would work fine.

 Placing the origin at the pizza store, the delivery area
 with radius 3 miles can be described as the region
 inside the circle described by x2 + y2 = 9 .
                                                                           Section 5.1 Circles 341

Main Street, located 2 miles north of the pizza store and running east to west, can be
described by the equation y = 2.
To find the portion of Main Street the store will deliver to, we first find the boundary of
their delivery region by looking for where the delivery circle intersects Main Street. To
find the intersection, we look for the points on the circle where y = 2. Substituting y = 2
into the circle equation lets us solve for the corresponding x values.

x2 + 22 = 9
x2 = 9- 4 = 5
x =  5  2.236

This means the pizza store will deliver 2.236 miles down Main Street east of Meridian
and 2.236 miles down Main Street west of Meridian. We can conclude that the pizza
store delivers to a 4.472 mile long segment of Main St.

In addition to finding where a vertical or horizontal line intersects the circle, we can also
find where an arbitrary line intersects a circle.

Example 7
 Find where the line f (x) = 4x intersects the circle (x - 2)2 + y 2 = 16 .

Normally, to find an intersection of two functions f(x) and g(x) we would solve for the x
value that would make the functions equal by solving the equation f(x) = g(x). In the
case of a circle, it isn't possible to represent the equation as a function, but we can
utilize the same idea.

The output value of the line determines the y value: y = f (x) = 4x . We want the y

value of the circle to equal the y value of the line, which is the output value of the
function. To do this, we can substitute the expression for y from the line into the circle
equation.

(x - 2)2 + y 2 = 16         replace y with the line formula: y = 4x
(x - 2)2 + (4x)2 = 16       expand
x 2 - 4x + 4 + 16 x 2 = 16  simplify
17 x2 - 4x + 4 = 16         since this equation is quadratic, we arrange one side to be 0
17 x2 - 4x -12 = 0

Since this quadratic doesn't appear to be easily factorable, we can use the quadratic
formula to solve for x:

x=  - (-4)  (-4)2 - 4(17)(-12) 4  832
                            =          , or approximately x  0.966 or -0.731
    2(17)                      34
342 Chapter 5

 From these x values we can use either equation to find the corresponding y values.
 Since the line equation is easier to evaluate, we might choose to use it:
  y = f (0.966) = 4(0.966) = 3.864
  y = f (-0.731) = 4(-0.731) = -2.923

 The line intersects the circle at the points (0.966, 3.864) and (-0.731, -2.923).

Section 5.2 Angles 347

Section 5.2 Angles

Because many applications involving circles also involve a rotation of the circle, it is
natural to introduce a measure for the rotation, or angle, between two rays (line segments)
emanating from the center of a circle. The angle measurement you are most likely
familiar with is degrees, so we'll begin there.

Measure of an Angle                                                      terminal side

The measure of an angle is a measurement between two                                angle
intersecting lines, line segments or rays, starting at the initial side               initial side
and ending at the terminal side. It is a rotational measure, not a
linear measure.

Measuring Angles

 Degrees
 A degree is a measurement of angle. One full rotation around the circle is equal to
 360 degrees, so one degree is 1/360 of a circle.

 An angle measured in degrees should always include the unit "degrees" after the
 number, or include the degree symbol . For example, 90 degrees = 90 .

 Standard Position
 When measuring angles on a circle, unless otherwise directed, we measure angles in
 standard position: starting at the positive horizontal axis and with counter-clockwise
 rotation.

Example 1
 Give the degree measure of the angle shown on the circle.

 The vertical and horizontal lines divide the circle into quarters.
 Since one full rotation is 360 degrees= 360 , each quarter rotation
 is 360/4 = 90 or 90 degrees.

Example 2
 Show an angle of 30 on the circle.

 An angle of 30 is 1/3 of 90 , so by dividing a quarter rotation into
 thirds, we can sketch a line at 30 .
348 Chapter 5

Going Greek

When representing angles using variables, it is traditional to use Greek letters. Here is a
list of commonly encountered Greek letters.

                or

theta          phi   alpha  beta

Working with Angles in Degrees

Notice that since there are 360 degrees in one rotation, an
angle greater than 360 degrees would indicate more than 1
full rotation. Shown on a circle, the resulting direction in
which this angle's terminal side points would be the same as
for another angle between 0 and 360 degrees. These angles
would be called coterminal.

Coterminal Angles

After completing their full rotation based on the given angle, two angles are
coterminal if they terminate in the same position, so their terminal sides coincide
(point in the same direction).

Example 3

 Find an angle  that is coterminal with 800 , where 0   360

 Since adding or subtracting a full rotation, 360 degrees, would result in an angle with
 terminal side pointing in the same direction, we can find coterminal angles by adding or
 subtracting 360 degrees. An angle of 800 degrees is coterminal with an angle of 800-
 360 = 440 degrees. It would also be coterminal with an angle of 440-360 = 80 degrees.

 The angle  = 80 is coterminal with 800 .

 By finding the coterminal angle between 0 and 360 degrees, it can be easier to see
 which direction the terminal side of an angle points in.

On a number line a positive number is measured to the right and a negative number is
measured in the opposite direction (to the left). Similarly a positive angle is measured
counterclockwise and a negative angle is measured in the opposite direction (clockwise).

Example 4
 Show the angle - 45 on the circle and find a positive angle that is coterminal and

  0    360.

Since 45 degrees is half of 90 degrees, we can start at the        315
positive horizontal axis and measure clockwise half of a 90                    -45
degree angle.

Since we can find coterminal angles by adding or subtracting a
full rotation of 360 degrees, we can find a positive coterminal
angle here by adding 360 degrees:
- 45 + 360 = 315

Angles in Radians

While measuring angles in degrees may be familiar, doing so often complicates matters
since the units of measure can get in the way of calculations. For this reason, another
measure of angles is commonly used. This measure is based on the distance around a
circle.
350 Chapter 5

Arclength                                                               r s
Arclength is the length of an arc, s, along a circle of radius r         

subtended (drawn out) by an angle .

It is the portion of the circumference between the initial and
terminal sides of the angle.

The length of the arc around an entire circle is called the circumference of a circle. The

circumference of a circle is C = 2r . The ratio of the circumference to the radius,
produces the constant 2 . Regardless of the radius, this ratio is always the same, just as

how the degree measure of an angle is independent of the radius.

To elaborate on this idea, consider two circles, one with radius 2 and one with radius 3.

Recall the circumference (perimeter) of a circle is C = 2r , where r is the radius of the
circle. The smaller circle then has circumference 2 (2) = 4 and the larger has
circumference 2 (3) = 6 .

Drawing a 45 degree angle on the two circles, we might be

interested in the length of the arc of the circle that the angle

indicates. In both cases, the 45 degree angle draws out an arc that                     45
is 1/8th of the full circumference, so for the smaller circle, the                            2 3

arclength = 1 (4 ) = 1  , and for the larger circle, the length of the
8                 2

arc or arclength = 1 (6 ) = 3  .
               8     4

Notice what happens if we find the ratio of the arclength divided by the radius of the
circle:

                   1
Smaller circle: 2 = 1 

                     24
                 3
Larger circle: 4 = 1 
                   34

The ratio is the same regardless of the radius of the circle - it only depends on the angle.
This property allows us to define a measure of the angle based on arclength.
                                                                           Section 5.2 Angles 351

Radians
The radian measure of an angle is the ratio of the length of the circular arc subtended
by the angle to the radius of the circle.

In other words, if s is the length of an arc of a circle, and r is the radius of the circle,
then
radian measure = s

                     r
If the circle has radius 1, then the radian measure corresponds to the length of the arc.

Because radian measure is the ratio of two lengths, it is a unitless measure. It is not
necessary to write the label "radians" after a radian measure, and if you see an angle that
is not labeled with "degrees" or the degree symbol, you should assume that it is a radian
measure.

Considering the most basic case, the unit circle (a circle with radius 1), we know that 1
rotation equals 360 degrees, 360 . We can also track one rotation around a circle by

finding the circumference, C = 2r , and for the unit circle C = 2 . These two different

ways to rotate around a circle give us a way to convert from degrees to radians.

1 rotation = 360 = 2 radians
 rotation = 180 =  radians
 rotation = 90 =  radians

                        2

Example 5
 Find the radian measure of one third of a full rotation.

For any circle, the arclength along such a rotation would be one third of the

circumference, C = 1 (2r) = 2r . The radian measure would be the arclength divided
                3             3

by the radius:

Radian measure = 2 r = 2 .

circular arc to the radius of the circle,  = s . From this relationship, we can find

                                                    r
arclength along a circle given an angle.

 Arclength on a Circle

 The length of an arc, s, along a circle of radius r subtended by angle in radians is
  s = r

Example 9
 Mercury orbits the sun at a distance of approximately 36 million miles. In one Earth
 day, it completes 0.0114 rotation around the sun. If the orbit was perfectly circular,
 what distance through space would Mercury travel in one Earth day?

 To begin, we will need to convert the decimal rotation value to a radian measure.

 Since one rotation = 2 radians,
 0.0114 rotation = 2 (0.0114) = 0.0716 radians.

 Combining this with the given radius of 36 million miles, we can find the arclength:
  s = (36)(0.0716) = 2.578 million miles travelled through space.

5. Find the arclength along a circle of radius 10 subtended by an angle of 215 degrees.

In addition to arclength, we can also use angles to find the area of a sector of a circle. A
sector is a portion of a circle contained between two lines from the center, like a slice of
pizza or pie.

Recall that the area of a circle with radius r can be found using the formula A =  r2 . If a

sector is cut out by an angle of  , measured in radians, then the fraction of full circle that

angle has cut out is  , since 2 is one full rotation. Thus, the area of the sector would
                       2

be this fraction of the whole area:

   2  r2 1 2
Area of sector =   r =               = r
 2                      2 2

Area of a Sector

The area of a sector of a circle with radius r subtended by an

angle  , measured in radians, is                                       r

Area of sector = 1  r2

Example 10
 An automatic lawn sprinkler sprays a distance of 20 feet while rotating 30 degrees.
 What is the area of the sector of grass the sprinkler waters?

First, we need to convert the angle measure into radians. Since 30 degrees is one of our

common angles, you ideally should already know the equivalent radian measure, but if

not we can convert:

30 degrees = 30   =  radians.                                          30 20 ft

                                  1  2                    2
The area of the sector is then Area =   (20) = 104.72 ft

Linear and Angular Velocity

When your car drives down a road, it makes sense to describe its speed in terms of miles
per hour or meters per second. These are measures of speed along a line, also called
linear velocity. When a point on a circle rotates, we would describe its angular velocity,
or rotational speed, in radians per second, rotations per minute, or degrees per hour.

 Angular and Linear Velocity
 As a point moves along a circle of radius r, its angular velocity,  , can be found as

 the angular rotation  per unit time, t.
  =

       t

 The linear velocity, v, of the point can be found as the distance travelled, arclength s,
 per unit time, t.
  v= s

      t

Example 11
 A water wheel completes 1 rotation every 5 seconds. Find the
 angular velocity in radians per second.2

 The wheel completes 1 rotation = 2 radians in 5 seconds, so the
 angular velocity would be  = 2  1.257 radians per second.

                                         5

Combining the definitions above with the arclength equation, s = r , we can find a

relationship between angular and linear velocities. The angular velocity equation can be

solved for  , giving  = t . Substituting this into the arclength equation gives
s = r = rt .

Substituting this into the linear velocity equation gives
v = s = rt = r

     tt

 Relationship Between Linear and Angular Velocity
 When the angular velocity is measured in radians per unit time, linear velocity and
 angular velocity are related by the equation
  v = r

Example 12
 A bicycle has wheels 28 inches in diameter. A tachometer determines the wheels are
 rotating at 180 RPM (revolutions per minute). Find the speed the bicycle is travelling
 down the road.

Here we have an angular velocity and need to find the corresponding linear velocity,
since the linear speed of the outside of the tires is the speed at which the bicycle travels
down the road.

We begin by converting from rotations per minute to radians per minute. It can be

helpful to utilize the units to make this conversion

180 rotations  2 radians = 360 radians
minute rotation                 minute

Using the formula from above along with the radius of the wheels, we can find the

linear velocity

v = (14 inches)  360  radians  = 5040  inches

                      minute           minute

You may be wondering where the "radians" went in this last equation. Remember that
radians are a unitless measure, so it is not necessary to include them.

Finally, we may wish to convert this linear velocity into a more familiar measurement,
like miles per hour.
5040 inches  1 feet  1 mile  60 minutes = 14.99 miles per hour (mph).

         minute 12 inches 5280 feet 1 hour

Section 5.3 Points on Circles Using Sine and Cosine

While it is convenient to describe the location of a point on a circle using an angle or a
distance along the circle, relating this information to the x and y coordinates and the circle
equation we explored in Section 5.1 is an important application of trigonometry.

A distress signal is sent from a sailboat during a storm, but the transmission is unclear
and the rescue boat sitting at the marina cannot determine the sailboat's location. Using
high powered radar, they determine the distress signal is coming from a distance of 20
miles at an angle of 225 degrees from the marina. How many miles east/west and
north/south of the rescue boat is the stranded sailboat?

In a general sense, to investigate this, we begin by                      (x, y)
drawing a circle centered at the origin with radius r,              r
and marking the point on the circle indicated by some                
angle . This point has coordinates (x, y).

If we drop a line segment vertically down from this
point to the x axis, we would form a right triangle
inside of the circle.

No matter which quadrant our angle  puts us in we
can draw a triangle by dropping a perpendicular line
segment to the x axis, keeping in mind that the values
of x and y may be positive or negative, depending on the quadrant.

Additionally, if the angle  puts us on an axis, we simply measure the radius as the x or y
with the other value being 0, again ensuring we have appropriate signs on the coordinates
based on the quadrant.

Triangles obtained from different radii will all be similar triangles, meaning
corresponding sides scale proportionally. While the lengths of the sides may change, as
we saw in the last section, the ratios of the side lengths will always remain constant for
any given angle.

y1 = y2        r1 y1  r2
r1 r2                         y2
x1 = x2         x1
r1 r2                  
                        x2

To be able to refer to these ratios more easily, we will give them names. Since the ratios

depend on the angle, we will write them as functions of the angle  .

Sine and Cosine                                                              (x, y)

For the point (x, y) on a circle of radius r at an angle of  , we can  r
                                                                             y
define two important functions as the ratios of the sides of the
corresponding triangle:                                                 
The sine function: sin( ) = y                                           x

                                   r

The cosine function: cos( ) = x
                                       r

In this chapter, we will explore these functions using both circles and right triangles. In
the next chapter, we will take a closer look at the behavior and characteristics of the sine
and cosine functions.

Example 1
 The point (3, 4) is on the circle of radius 5 at some angle . Find cos( ) and sin( ) .

Knowing the radius of the circle and coordinates of the point, we can evaluate the

cosine and sine functions as the ratio of the sides.

cos( ) = x = 3  sin( ) = y = 4
           r5              r5

There are a few cosine and sine values which we can determine fairly easily because the
corresponding point on the circle falls on the x or y axis.

Example 2                                                                (0, r)

 On any circle, the terminal side of a 90 degree angle                     90
 points straight up, so the coordinates of the
 corresponding point on the circle would be (0, r).
 Using our definitions of cosine and sine,
  cos(90) = x = 0 = 0

 Coordinates of the Point on a Circle at a Given Angle

 On a circle of radius r at an angle of  , we can find the coordinates of the point

 (x, y) at that angle using
  x = r cos( )
  y = r sin( )

 On a unit circle, a circle with radius 1, x = cos( ) and y = sin( ) .

Utilizing the basic equation for a circle centered at the origin, x2 + y2 = r 2 , combined
with the relationships above, we can establish a new identity.

x2 + y2 = r2                         substituting the relations above,
(r cos( ))2 + (r sin( ))2 = r 2      simplifying,
r 2 (cos( ))2 + r 2 (sin( ))2 = r 2  dividing by r 2
(cos( ))2 + (sin( ))2 = 1            or using shorthand notation
cos 2 ( ) + sin 2 ( ) = 1

Here cos2 ( ) is a commonly used shorthand notation for (cos( ))2 . Be aware that many
calculators and computers do not understand the shorthand notation.

In Section 5.1 we related the Pythagorean Theorem a 2 + b2 = c2 to the basic equation of
a circle x2 + y2 = r 2 , which we have now used to arrive at the Pythagorean Identity.

Pythagorean Identity
The Pythagorean Identity. For any angle , cos 2 ( ) + sin 2 ( ) = 1.

One use of this identity is that it helps us to find a cosine value of an angle if we know
the sine value of that angle or vice versa. However, since the equation will yield two
possible values, we will need to utilize additional knowledge of the angle to help us find
the desired value.
                            Section 5.3 Points on Circles Using Sine and Cosine 365

Example 3

 If sin( ) = 3 and  is in the second quadrant, find cos( ) .

                7

Substituting the known value for sine into the Pythagorean identity,
             32

cos 2 ( ) +   = 1
            7

cos 2 ( ) + 9 = 1
             49

cos 2 ( ) = 40
             49

cos( ) =  40 =  40 =  2 10
          49           7    7

Since the angle is in the second quadrant, we know the x value of the point would be
negative, so the cosine value should also be negative. Using this additional information,

we can conclude that cos( ) = - 2 10 .
                                            7

Values for Sine and Cosine

At this point, you may have noticed that we haven't found any cosine or sine values from
angles not on an axis. To do this, we will need to utilize our knowledge of triangles.

First, consider a point on a circle at an angle of 45 degrees, or  .                 (x, y) = (x, x)
                                                                             4

At this angle, the x and y coordinates of the corresponding point               1 y
on the circle will be equal because 45 degrees divides the first

quadrant in half. Since the x and y values will be the same, the                45

sine and cosine values will also be equal. Utilizing the                        x

Pythagorean Identity,

inside a circle with one side at an angle of 30 degrees, and
another at an angle of -30 degrees. If the resulting two right
triangles are combined into one large triangle, notice that all
three angles of this larger triangle will be 60 degrees.
                     Section 5.3 Points on Circles Using Sine and Cosine 367

Since all the angles are equal, the sides will all be equal as            r  60
well. The vertical line has length 2y, and since the sides are all  60            y
equal we can conclude that 2y = r, or y = r . Using this, we
                                                                         r          y

We have now found the cosine and sine values for all the commonly encountered angles
in the first quadrant of the unit circle.

For any given angle in the first quadrant, there will be an angle in another quadrant with
the same sine value, and yet another angle in yet another quadrant with the same cosine
value. Since the sine value is the y coordinate on the unit circle, the other angle with the
same sine will share the same y value, but have the opposite x value. Likewise, the angle
with the same cosine will share the same x value, but have the opposite y value.

As shown here, angle  has the same sine value as angle ; the cosine values would be
opposites. The angle  has the same cosine value as the angle ; the sine values would be
opposites.

sin( ) = sin( ) and cos( ) = - cos( )  sin( ) = - sin(  ) and cos( ) = cos( )

                           (x, y)                              (x, y)
                r                                        r

                                                            

                                                  

It is important to notice the relationship between the angles. If, from the angle, you
measured the smallest angle to the horizontal axis, all would have the same measure in
absolute value. We say that all these angles have a reference angle of .
              Section 5.3 Points on Circles Using Sine and Cosine 369

Reference Angle                                                   (x, y)
An angle's reference angle is the size of the
smallest angle to the horizontal axis.                          

A reference angle is always an angle between 0                
and 90 degrees, or 0 and  radians.

                               2

Angles share the same cosine and sine values as
their reference angles, except for signs (positive or
negative) which can be determined from the
quadrant of the angle.

Example 5
 Find the reference angle of 150 degrees. Use it to find cos(150) and sin(150) .

150 degrees is located in the second quadrant. It is 30 degrees short of the horizontal
axis at 180 degrees, so the reference angle is 30 degrees.

This tells us that 150 degrees has the same sine and cosine values as 30 degrees, except

for sign. We know that sin( 30) = 1 and cos(30) = 3 . Since 150 degrees is in the
              2                                        2

second quadrant, the x coordinate of the point on the circle would be negative, so the

cosine value will be negative. The y coordinate is positive, so the sine value will be

positive.

sin(150 ) = 1 and cos(150) = - 3
           2  2

The (x, y) coordinates for the point on a unit circle at an angle of 150 are  - 3 ,  1  .
                                                                                         2 2

Using symmetry and reference angles, we can fill in cosine and sine values at the rest of
the special angles on the unit circle. Take time to learn the (x, y) coordinates of all the
major angles in the first quadrant!

Example 7
 We now have the tools to return to the sailboat question posed at the beginning of this
 section.

A distress signal is sent from a sailboat during a         N
storm, but the transmission is unclear and the rescue
boat sitting at the marina cannot determine the                  225
sailboat's location. Using high powered radar, they                          E
determine the distress signal is coming from a point W
20 miles away at an angle of 225 degrees from the       20 mi
marina. How many miles east/west and north/south
of the rescue boat is the stranded sailboat?

We can now answer the question by finding the S
coordinates of the point on a circle with a radius of 20
miles at an angle of 225 degrees.

x = 20 cos(225) = 20   - 2   -14.142 miles

                         2

y = 20 sin (225) = 20   - 2   -14.142 miles

                         2

The sailboat is located 14.142 miles west and 14.142 miles south of the marina.

The special values of sine and cosine in the first quadrant are very useful to know, since
knowing them allows you to quickly evaluate the sine and cosine of very common angles
without needing to look at a reference or use your calculator. However, scenarios do
come up where we need to know the sine and cosine of other angles.

To find the cosine and sine of any other angle, we turn to a computer or calculator. Be
aware: most calculators can be set into "degree" or "radian" mode, which tells the
calculator the units for the input value. When you evaluate "cos(30)" on your calculator,
it will evaluate it as the cosine of 30 degrees if the calculator is in degree mode, or the
cosine of 30 radians if the calculator is in radian mode. Most computer software with
cosine and sine functions only operates in radian mode.
372 Chapter 5

Example 8
 Evaluate the cosine of 20 degrees using a calculator or computer.

 On a calculator that can be put in degree mode, you can evaluate this directly to be
 approximately 0.939693.

 On a computer or calculator without degree mode, you would first need to convert the

Section 5.4 The Other Trigonometric Functions

In the previous section, we defined the sine and cosine functions as ratios of the sides of a
right triangle in a circle. Since the triangle has 3 sides there are 6 possible combinations
of ratios. While the sine and cosine are the two prominent ratios that can be formed,
there are four others, and together they define the 6 trigonometric functions.

Tangent, Secant, Cosecant, and Cotangent Functions

For the point (x, y) on a circle of radius r at an angle of  , we can        (x, y)

define four additional important functions as the ratios of the        r
sides of the corresponding triangle:                                         y

The tangent function:   tan( ) = y                                      
                                   x                                     x

The secant function:    sec( ) = r
                                   x

The cosecant function:  csc( ) = r
                                   y

The cotangent function: cot( ) = x
                                            y

Geometrically, notice that the definition of tangent corresponds with the slope of the line
segment between the origin (0, 0) and the point (x, y). This relationship can be very
helpful in thinking about tangent values.

You may also notice that the ratios defining the secant, cosecant, and cotangent are the
reciprocals of the ratios defining the cosine, sine, and tangent functions, respectively.
Additionally, notice that using our results from the last section,
tan( ) = y = r sin( ) = sin( )

           x r cos( ) cos( )

Applying this concept to the other trig functions we can state the reciprocal identities.

Identities

The other four trigonometric functions can be related back to the sine and cosine
functions using these basic relationships:

tan( ) = sin( )   sec( ) = 1                   csc( ) = 1        cot( ) = 1 = cos( )
          cos( )            cos( )                       sin( )            tan( ) sin( )
376 Chapter 5

These relationships are called identities. Identities are statements that are true for all
values of the input on which they are defined. Identities are usually something that can
be derived from definitions and relationships we already know, similar to how the
identities above were derived from the circle relationships of the six trig functions. The
Pythagorean Identity we learned earlier was derived from the Pythagorean Theorem and
the definitions of sine and cosine. We will discuss the role of identities more after an
example.

Example 1
                                  5 

 Evaluate tan(45) and sec  .
                                   6

 Since we know the sine and cosine values for these angles, it makes sense to relate the
 tangent and secant values back to the sine and cosine values.

tan(45) = sin( 45) =    2
             cos(45)      2 =1

                        2
                          2

Notice this result is consistent with our interpretation of the tangent value as the slope
of the line passing through the origin at the given angle: a line at 45 degrees would
indeed have a slope of 1.

1. Evaluate csc  .
                    6

Just as we often need to simplify algebraic expressions, it is often also necessary or
helpful to simplify trigonometric expressions. To do so, we utilize the definitions and
identities we have established.
                      Section 5.4 The Other Trigonometric Functions 377

Example 2

 Simplify sec( ) .
          tan( )

We can simplify this by rewriting both functions in terms of sine and cosine

sec( ) 1cos( )        To divide the fractions we could invert and multiply
tan( ) = sin ( )      cancelling the cosines,

             cos( )
= 1 cos( )

  cos( ) sin ( )

= 1 sin ( ) = csc( )  simplifying and using the identity

By showing that sec( ) can be simplified to csc( ), we have, in fact, established a new
                tan( )

identity: that sec( ) = csc( ).
             tan( )

Occasionally a question may ask you to "prove the identity" or "establish the identity."
This is the same idea as when an algebra book asks a question like "show that
(x -1)2 = x2 - 2x +1." In this type of question, we must show the algebraic
manipulations that demonstrate that the left and right side of the equation are in fact
equal. You can think of a "prove the identity" problem as a simplification problem where
you know the answer: you know what the end goal of the simplification should be, and
just need to show the steps to get there.

To prove an identity, in most cases you will start with the expression on one side of the
identity and manipulate it using algebra and trigonometric identities until you have
simplified it to the expression on the other side of the equation. Do not treat the identity
like an equation to solve - it isn't! The proof is establishing if the two expressions are
equal, so we must take care to work with one side at a time rather than applying
an operation simultaneously to both sides of the equation.

Example 3
 Prove the identity 1+ cot( ) = sin( ) + cos( ) .
                         csc( )

 Since the left side seems a bit more complicated, we will start there and simplify the
 expression until we obtain the right side. We can use the right side as a guide for what
 might be good steps to make. In this case, the left side involves a fraction while the
 right side doesn't, which suggests we should look to see if the fraction can be reduced.
378 Chapter 5

Additionally, since the right side involves sine and cosine and the left does not, it
suggests that rewriting the cotangent and cosecant using sine and cosine might be a
good idea.

1+ cot( )                    Rewriting the cotangent and cosecant
 csc( )                      To divide the fractions, we invert and multiply
  1+ cos( )

    sin( )

= 1+ cos()  sin()            Distributing,
   sin()  1                  Simplifying the fractions,
                             Establishing the identity.
= 1 sin( ) + cos( )  sin( )
       1 sin( ) 1

= sin( ) + cos( )

Notice that in the second step, we could have combined the 1 and cos( ) before
                                                                             sin( )

inverting and multiplying. It is very common when proving or simplifying identities for
there to be more than one way to obtain the same result.

We can also utilize identities we have previously learned, like the Pythagorean Identity,
while simplifying or proving identities.

Example 4

 Establish the identity cos2 ( ) = 1- sin ( ).
                    1+ sin( )

Since the left side of the identity is more complicated, it makes sense to start there. To
simplify this, we will have to reduce the fraction, which would require the numerator to
have a factor in common with the denominator. Additionally, we notice that the right
side only involves sine. Both of these suggest that we need to convert the cosine into
something involving sine.

Recall the Pythagorean Identity told us cos 2 ( ) + sin 2 ( ) = 1. By moving one of the
trig functions to the other side, we can establish:

sin 2 ( ) = 1- cos 2 ( )     and                cos 2 ( ) = 1- sin 2 ( )

Utilizing this, we now can establish the identity. We start on one side and manipulate:
                                Section 5.4 The Other Trigonometric Functions 379

 cos2 ( )                       Utilizing the Pythagorean Identity
1+ sin( )                       Factoring the numerator
                                Cancelling the like factors
= 1- sin 2 ( )                  Establishing the identity
  1+ sin ( )

= (1- sin ( ))(1+ sin ( ))
       1+ sin ( )

= 1- sin ( )

We can also build new identities from previously established identities. For example, if

we divide both sides of the Pythagorean Identity by cosine squared (which is allowed

since we've already shown the identity is true),

cos 2 ( ) + sin 2 ( )      1    Splitting the fraction on the left,
                       =2
cos 2 ( )              cos ( )

cos 2 ( ) sin 2 ( )        1    Simplifying and using the definitions of tan and sec

2. Use a similar approach to establish that cot 2 ( ) +1 = csc2 ( ) .

 Identities
 Alternate forms of the Pythagorean Identity
 1+ tan 2 ( ) = sec2 ( )

Example 5

 If tan( ) = 2 and  is in the 3rd quadrant, find cos( ) .

                7

 There are two approaches to this problem, both of which work equally well.
380 Chapter 5

Approach 1
Since tan( ) = y and the angle is in the third quadrant, we can imagine a triangle in a

                   x
circle of some radius so that the point on the circle is (-7, -2), so y = - 2 = 2 .

                                                                                 x -7 7

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the radius of the circle:
(-7)2 + (-2)2 = r 2 , so r = 53 .

Now we can find the cosine value:
cos( ) = x = - 7

           r 53

Approach 2
Using the 1+ tan 2 ( ) = sec2 ( ) form of the Pythagorean Identity with the known

tangent value,
1+ tan 2 ( ) = sec2 ( )

2  2

1 +   = sec ( )2

7

53 = sec2 ( )
49

sec( ) =  53 =  53
      49                 7

Since the angle is in the third quadrant, the cosine value will be negative so the secant
value will also be negative. Keeping the negative result, and using definition of secant,

sec( ) = - 53
               7

   1 = - 53                  Inverting both sides
cos( ) 7

cos( ) = - 7 = - 7 53

Section 5.5 Right Triangle Trigonometry

In section 5.3 we were introduced to the sine and cosine function as ratios of the sides of
a triangle drawn inside a circle, and spent the rest of that section discussing the role of
those functions in finding points on the circle. In this section, we return to the triangle,
and explore the applications of the trigonometric functions to right triangles where circles
may not be involved.

Recall that we defined sine and cosine as        (x, y)
sin( ) = y
                                           r
           r                                     y
cos( ) = x
                                            
           r                                 x

Separating the triangle from the circle, we can make equivalent but more general
definitions of the sine, cosine, and tangent on a right triangle. On the right triangle, we
will label the hypotenuse as well as the side opposite the angle and the side adjacent (next
to) the angle.

Right Triangle Relationships               hypotenuse        opposite
Given a right triangle with an angle of 
                                                 
sin( ) = opposite                                  adjacent
           hypotenuse

cos( ) = adjacent
           hypotenuse

tan( ) = opposite
           adjacent

A common mnemonic for remembering these relationships is SohCahToa, formed from
the first letters of "Sine is opposite over hypotenuse, Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse,
Tangent is opposite over adjacent."
386 Chapter 5

Example 1                                                        17
 Given the triangle shown, find the value for cos( ) .                               8

 The side adjacent to the angle is 15, and the                 
 hypotenuse of the triangle is 17, so
  cos( ) = adjacent = 15                                             15

              hypotenuse 17

When working with general right triangles, the same rules apply regardless of the
orientation of the triangle. In fact, we can evaluate the sine and cosine of either of the
two acute angles in the triangle.

1. A right triangle is drawn with angle  opposite a side with length 33, angle

You may have noticed that in the above example that cos( ) = sin(  ) and

cos( ) = sin( ) . This makes sense since the side opposite  is also adjacent to . Since

the three angles in a triangle need to add to , or 180 degrees, then the other two angles

must add to  , or 90 degrees, so  =  -  , and  =  -  . Since cos( ) = sin(  ) ,

then cos( ) = sin  -   .

Cofunction Identities

The cofunction identities for sine and cosine are:

                                         
cos( ) = sin  -           sin( ) = cos -  

              2                         2 

In the previous examples, we evaluated the sine and cosine on triangles where we knew
all three sides of the triangle. Right triangle trigonometry becomes powerful when we
start looking at triangles in which we know an angle but don't know all the sides.

Example 3
 Find the unknown sides of the triangle pictured here.

Since sin( ) = opposite , sin( 30) = 7 .
   hypotenuse                            b
                                                              30 b
From this, we can solve for the side b.                    a
b sin( 30) = 7
                                                                             7
b= 7
     sin( 30)

To obtain a value, we can evaluate the sine and simplify
b = 7 = 14

       2

To find the value for side a, we could use the cosine, or simply apply the Pythagorean
Theorem:
a2 + 72 = b2
a 2 + 7 2 = 14 2

a = 147

2. A right triangle has one angle of  and a hypotenuse of 20. Find the unknown sides

    and angles of the triangle.

Example 4
 To find the height of a tree, a person walks to a point 30 feet from the base of the tree,
 and measures the angle from the ground to the top of the tree to be 57 degrees. Find the
 height of the tree.

We can introduce a variable, h, to represent the height   57
of the tree. The two sides of the triangle that are most       30 feet
important to us are the side opposite the angle, the
height of the tree we are looking for, and the adjacent
side, the side we are told is 30 feet long.

The trigonometric function which relates the side
opposite of the angle and the side adjacent to the angle
is the tangent.

tan(57) = opposite = h     Solving for h,
             adjacent 30   Using technology, we can approximate a value

h = 30 tan(57)
h = 30 tan(57)  46.2 feet

The tree is approximately 46 feet tall.

Example 5

 A person standing on the roof of a 100 foot tall building is looking towards a skyscraper
 a few blocks away, wondering how tall it is. She measures the angle of declination
 from the roof of the building to the base of the skyscraper to be 20 degrees and the
 angle of inclination to the top of the skyscraper to be 42 degrees.
                                            Section 5.5 Right Triangle Trigonometry 389

To approach this problem, it would be

good to start with a picture. Although

we are interested in the height, h, of the

skyscraper, it can be helpful to also label

other unknown quantities in the picture -                         a
in this case the horizontal distance x
between the buildings and a, the height                                    h
of the skyscraper above the person.                  42 x

To start solving this problem, notice we 100 ft      20
                                                           100 ft

have two right triangles. In the top

triangle, we know one angle is 42

degrees, but we don't know any of the sides of the triangle, so we don't yet know

enough to work with this triangle.

In the lower right triangle, we know one angle is 20 degrees, and we know the vertical
height measurement of 100 ft. Since we know these two pieces of information, we can
solve for the unknown distance x.

tan(20) = opposite = 100              Solving for x
             adjacent x

x tan(20) = 100

x = 100
    tan(20)

Now that we have found the distance x, we know enough information to solve the top
right triangle.
tan(42) = opposite = a = a

              adjacent x 100 tan(20)

tan(42) = a tan(20)
                 100

100 tan(42) = a tan(20)

100 tan(42) = a
   tan(20)

Approximating a value,
a = 100 tan(42)  247.4 feet

       tan(20)

Adding the height of the first building, we determine that the skyscraper is about 347
feet tall.

Periodic Functions

In the previous chapter, the trigonometric functions were introduced as ratios of sides of a
right triangle, and related to points on a circle. We noticed how the x and y values of the
points did not change with repeated revolutions around the circle by finding coterminal
angles. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at the important characteristics and
applications of these types of functions, and begin solving equations involving them.

The London Eye1 is a huge Ferris wheel 135 meters
(394 feet) tall in London, England, which completes one
rotation every 30 minutes. When we look at the
behavior of this Ferris wheel it is clear that it completes
1 cycle, or 1 revolution, and then repeats this revolution
over and over again.

This is an example of a periodic function, because the
Ferris wheel repeats its revolution or one cycle every 30
minutes, and so we say it has a period of 30 minutes.

In this section, we will work to sketch a graph of a
rider's height above the ground over time and express
this height as a function of time.

 Periodic Functions
 A periodic function is a function for which a specific horizontal shift, P, results in the
 original function: f (x + P) = f (x) for all values of x. When this occurs we call the
 smallest such horizontal shift with P > 0 the period of the function.

You might immediately guess that there is a connection here to finding points on a circle,
since the height above ground would correspond to the y value of a point on the circle.
We can determine the y value by using the sine function. To get a better sense of this
function's behavior, we can create a table of values we know, and use them to sketch a
graph of the sine and cosine functions.

Listing some of the values for sine and cosine on a unit circle,

Here you can see how for each angle, we use the y value of the point on the circle to
determine the output value of the sine function.

                                                f() = sin()

Plotting more points gives the full shape of the sine and cosine functions.

Notice how the sine values are positive between 0 and , which correspond to the values
of sine in quadrants 1 and 2 on the unit circle, and the sine values are negative between 
and 2, corresponding to quadrants 3 and 4.

Like the sine function we can track the value of the cosine function through the 4
quadrants of the unit circle as we place it on a graph.
Both of these functions are defined for all real numbers, since we can evaluate the sine
and cosine of any angle. By thinking of sine and cosine as coordinates of points on a unit
circle, it becomes clear that the range of both functions must be the interval [-1, 1] .

 Domain and Range of Sine and Cosine
 The domain of sine and cosine is all real numbers, (-, ) .
 The range of sine and cosine is the interval [-1, 1].

Both these graphs are called sinusoidal graphs.
In both graphs, the shape of the graph begins repeating after 2. Indeed, since any
coterminal angles will have the same sine and cosine values, we could conclude that

sin( + 2 ) = sin( ) and cos( + 2 ) = cos( ) .

In other words, if you were to shift either graph horizontally by 2, the resulting shape
would be identical to the original function. Sinusoidal functions are a specific type of
periodic function.

 Period of Sine and Cosine
 The periods of the sine and cosine functions are both 2.
398 Chapter 6

Looking at these functions on a domain centered at the vertical axis helps reveal
symmetries.

sine                cosine

The sine function is symmetric about the origin, the same symmetry the cubic function
has, making it an odd function. The cosine function is clearly symmetric about the y axis,
the same symmetry as the quadratic function, making it an even function.

Negative Angle Identities

The sine is an odd function, symmetric about the origin, so sin( - ) = - sin( ) .
The cosine is an even function, symmetric about the y-axis, so cos(- ) = cos( ) .

These identities can be used, among other purposes, for helping with simplification and
proving identities.

                                                                                 
You may recall the cofunction identity from last chapter, sin( ) = cos -   .

                                                                                     2 

Graphically, this tells us that the sine and cosine graphs are horizontal transformations of
each other. We can prove this by using the cofunction identity and the negative angle
identity for cosine.

                 
sin( ) = cos -  = cos - +  = cos -  -  = cos - 
      2          2    2      2

Now we can clearly see that if we horizontally shift the cosine function to the right by /2
we get the sine function.

Remember this shift is not representing the period of the function. It only shows that the
cosine and sine function are transformations of each other.

Transforming Sine and Cosine

Example 2
 A point rotates around a circle of radius 3.
 Sketch a graph of the y coordinate of the
 point.

 Recall that for a point on a circle of radius
 r, the y coordinate of the point is

  y = r sin( ) , so in this case, we get the
 equation y( ) = 3sin( ) .

 The constant 3 causes a vertical stretch of
 the y values of the function by a factor of 3.

 Notice that the period of the function does not change.

Since the outputs of the graph will now oscillate between -3 and 3, we say that the
amplitude of the sine wave is 3.

    function.
400 Chapter 6

Example 3                                                    3 ft
 A circle with radius 3 feet is mounted with its center 4
 feet off the ground. The point closest to the ground is                     4 ft
 labeled P. Sketch a graph of the height above ground of
 the point P as the circle is rotated, then find a function  P
 that gives the height in terms of the angle of rotation.

 Sketching the height, we note that it will start 1 foot
 above the ground, then increase up to 7 feet above the
 ground, and continue to oscillate 3 feet above and
 below the center value of 4 feet.

Although we could use a transformation of either the
sine or cosine function, we start by looking for
characteristics that would make one function easier to
use than the other.

We decide to use a cosine function because it starts at
the highest or lowest value, while a sine function starts
at the middle value. A standard cosine starts at the
highest value, and this graph starts at the lowest value,
so we need to incorporate a vertical reflection.

Second, we see that the graph oscillates 3 above and below the center, while a basic
cosine has an amplitude of one, so this graph has been vertically stretched by 3, as in
the last example.

Finally, to move the center of the circle up to a height of 4, the graph has been vertically
shifted up by 4. Putting these transformations together,

h( ) = -3cos( ) + 4

Midline
The center value of a sinusoidal function, the value that the function oscillates above
and below, is called the midline of the function, corresponding to a vertical shift.

The function f ( ) = cos( ) + k has midline at y = k.

2. What is the midline of the function f ( ) = 3cos( ) - 4 ? Sketch a graph of the

    function.
                                                                Section 6.1 Sinusoidal Graphs 401

To answer the Ferris wheel problem at the beginning of the section, we need to be able to
express our sine and cosine functions at inputs of time. To do so, we will utilize
composition. Since the sine function takes an input of an angle, we will look for a

function that takes time as an input and outputs an angle. If we can find a suitable  (t)
function, then we can compose this with our f ( ) = cos( ) function to obtain a sinusoidal
function of time: f (t) = cos( (t)) .

Example 4
 A point completes 1 revolution every 2 minutes around a circle of radius 5. Find the x
 coordinate of the point as a function of time, if it starts at (5, 0).

 Normally, we would express the x coordinate of a point on a circle centered at the origin

 using x = r cos( ) . Here we write the function x( ) = 5cos( ) .

 The rotation rate of 1 revolution every 2 minutes is an
 angular velocity. We can use this rate to find a formula for
 the angle as a function of time. The point begins at an
 angle of 0. Since the point rotates 1 revolution = 2
 radians every 2 minutes, it rotates  radians every minute.
 After t minutes, it will have rotated:

  (t) =  t radians

 Composing this with the cosine function, we obtain a
 function of time.

  x(t) = 5cos( (t)) = 5cos( t)

Notice that this composition has the effect of a horizontal compression, changing the
period of the function.

To see how the period relates to the stretch or compression coefficient B in the equation

f (t) = sin(Bt), note that the period will be the time it takes to complete one full

revolution of a circle. If a point takes P minutes to complete 1 revolution, then the

angular velocity is 2 radians . Then  (t) = 2 t . Composing with a sine function,
P minutes                    P

                        2 
f (t) = sin( (t)) = sin  t 

                         P 

From this, we can determine the relationship between the coefficient B and the period:
B = 2 .

      P
402 Chapter 6

Notice that the stretch or compression coefficient B is a ratio of the "normal period of a
sinusoidal function" to the "new period." If we know the stretch or compression
coefficient B, we can solve for the "new period": P = 2 .

                                                                  B

Summarizing our transformations so far:

 Transformations of Sine and Cosine

 Given an equation in the form f (t) = Asin(Bt)+ k or f (t) = Acos(Bt)+ k

 A is the vertical stretch, and is the amplitude of the function.
 B is the horizontal stretch/compression, and is related to the period, P, by P = 2 .

                                                                                                  B
 k is the vertical shift and determines the midline of the function.

                                                        6 

Using the relationship above, the stretch/compression factor is B =  , so the period
                                                                                  6

will be P = 2 = 2 = 2  6 = 12 .

While it is common to compose sine or cosine with functions involving time, the
composition can be done so that the input represents any reasonable quantity.
     Section 6.1 Sinusoidal Graphs 403

Example 6
 A bicycle wheel with radius 14 inches has the bottom-most point on the wheel marked
 in red. The wheel then begins rolling down the street. Write a formula for the height
 above ground of the red point after the bicycle has travelled x inches.

The height of the point begins at the lowest value, 0,            Starting
increases to the highest value of 28 inches, and
continues to oscillate above and below a center height     14in
of 14 inches. In terms of the angle of rotation, :

h( ) = -14 cos( ) + 14

In this case, x is representing a linear distance the      Rotated by 
wheel has travelled, corresponding to an arclength
along the circle. Since arclength and angle can be                       
                                                                    x
related by s = r , in this case we can write x = 14 ,

which allows us to express the angle in terms of x:
 (x) = x

         14

Composing this with our cosine-based function from above,

x    1 
h(x) = h( (x)) = -14 cos  + 14 = -14 cos x  + 14
14   14 

The period of this function would be P = 2 = 2 = 2 14 = 28 , the circumference

                                                        14
of the circle. This makes sense - the wheel completes one full revolution after the
bicycle has travelled a distance equivalent to the circumference of the wheel.

Example 7

 Determine the midline, amplitude, and period of the function f (t) = 3sin(2t)+1.

Amplitude, midline, and period, when combined with vertical flips, allow us to write
equations for a variety of sinusoidal situations.

3. If a sinusoidal function starts on the midline at point (0,3), has an amplitude of 2, and

    a period of 4, write a formula for the function

Example 8
 Find a formula for the sinusoidal function
 graphed here.

 The graph oscillates from a low of -1 to a
 high of 3, putting the midline at y = 1,
 halfway between.

 The amplitude will be 2, the distance from
 the midline to the highest value (or lowest
 value) of the graph.

 The period of the graph is 8. We can measure this from the first peak at x = -2 to the
 second at x = 6. Since the period is 8, the stretch/compression factor we will use will be
  B = 2 = 2 = 

        P 84

 At x = 0, the graph is at the midline value, which tells us the graph can most easily be
 represented as a sine function. Since the graph then decreases, this must be a vertical
 reflection of the sine function. Putting this all together,

                  
   f (t) = -2sin  t  + 1

                  4 

With these transformations, we are ready to answer the Ferris wheel problem from the
beginning of the section.

Example 9
 The London Eye is a huge Ferris wheel in London, England, which completes one
 rotation every 30 minutes. The diameter of the wheel is 120 meters, but the passenger
 capsules sit outside the wheel. Suppose the diameter at the capsules is 130 meters, and
 riders board from a platform 5 meters above the ground. Express a rider's height above
 ground as a function of time in minutes.

 It can often help to sketch a graph of the situation before trying to find the equation.
                                                                Section 6.1 Sinusoidal Graphs 405

 With a diameter of 130 meters, the wheel has a
 radius of 65 meters. The height will oscillate with
 amplitude of 65 meters above and below the
 center.

 Passengers board 5 meters above ground level, so
 the center of the wheel must be located 65 + 5 =
 70 meters above ground level. The midline of the
 oscillation will be at 70 meters.

 The wheel takes 30 minutes to complete 1
 revolution, so the height will oscillate with period
 of 30 minutes.

 Lastly, since the rider boards at the lowest point,
 the height will start at the smallest value and
 increase, following the shape of a flipped cosine curve.
 Putting these together:
 Amplitude: 65
 Midline: 70
 Period: 30, so B = 2 = 

                         30 15
 Shape: negative cosine

 An equation for the rider's height would be
                   

  h(t) = -65cos  t  + 70
                    15 

Try it Now
4. The Ferris wheel at the Puyallup Fair2 has a diameter of about 70

    feet and takes 3 minutes to complete a full rotation. Passengers
    board from a platform 10 feet above the ground. Write an
    equation for a rider's height above ground over time.

While these transformations are sufficient to represent many situations, occasionally we
encounter a sinusoidal function that does not have a vertical intercept at the lowest point,
highest point, or midline. In these cases, we need to use horizontal shifts. Since we are
combining horizontal shifts with horizontal stretches, we need to be careful. Recall that
when the inside of the function is factored, it reveals the horizontal shift.

406 Chapter 6

 Horizontal Shifts of Sine and Cosine

 Given an equation in the form f (t) = Asin(B(t - h))+ k or f (t) = Acos(B(t - h))+ k

 h is the horizontal shift of the function

Example 10
                                      

 Sketch a graph of f (t) = 3sin  t -  .
                                      4 4

To reveal the horizontal shift, we first need to factor inside the function:

   
f (t) = 3sin  (t -1)
4  

This graph will have the shape of a sine function, starting at the midline and increasing,

with an amplitude of 3. The period of the graph will be P = 2 = 2 = 2  4 = 8 .
                                           B                                     

                                                                              4
Finally, the graph will be shifted to the right by 1.

In some physics and mathematics books, you will hear the horizontal shift referred to as
phase shift. In other physics and mathematics books, they would say the phase shift of
the equation above is  , the value in the unfactored form. Because of this ambiguity, we

                           4
will not use the term phase shift any further, and will only talk about the horizontal shift.

Example 11
 Find a formula for the function graphed here.

With highest value at 1 and lowest value at -5, the
midline will be halfway between at -2.

The distance from the midline to the highest or
lowest value gives an amplitude of 3.

The period of the graph is 6, which can be
measured from the peak at x = 1 to the next peak at
x = 7, or from the distance between the lowest
points. This gives B = 2 = 2 =  .

                              P 63

For the shape and shift, we have more than one option. We could either write this as:
A cosine shifted 1 to the right
A negative cosine shifted 2 to the left
A sine shifted  to the left
A negative sine shifted 2.5 to the right

While any of these would be fine, the cosine shifts are easier to work with than the sine

shifts in this case, because they involve integer values. Writing these:

   
y(x) = 3cos (x -1) - 2    or
3  

     
y(x) = -3cos (x + 2) - 2
3    

Again, these functions are equivalent, so both yield the same graph.

Section 6.2 Graphs of the Other Trig Functions

In this section, we will explore the graphs of the other four trigonometric functions.
We'll begin with the tangent function. Recall that in Chapter 5 we defined tangent as y/x
or sine/cosine, so you can think of the tangent as the slope of a line through the origin
making the given angle with the positive x axis.

At an angle of 0, the line would be horizontal with a slope of zero. As the angle increases
towards /2, the slope increases more and more. At an angle of /2, the line would be
vertical and the slope would be undefined.
Immediately past /2, the line would have a steep
negative slope, giving a large negative tangent value.
There is a break in the function at /2, where the
tangent value jumps from large positive to large
negative.

We can use these ideas along with the definition of
tangent to sketch a graph. Since tangent is defined as
sine/cosine, we can determine that tangent will be
zero when sine is zero: at -, 0, , and so on.
Likewise, tangent will be undefined when cosine is
zero: at -/2, /2, and so on.

The tangent is positive from 0 to /2 and  to 3/2, corresponding to quadrants 1 and 3 of
the unit circle.

Using technology, we can obtain a graph of tangent on a standard grid.

Notice that the graph appears to repeat itself. For any
angle on the circle, there is a second angle with the
same slope and tangent value halfway around the
circle, so the graph repeats itself with a period of ;
we can see one continuous cycle from - /2 to /2,
before it jumps and repeats itself.

The graph has vertical asymptotes and the tangent is
undefined wherever a line at that angle would be
vertical: at /2, 3/2, and so on. While the domain of
the function is limited in this way, the range of the
function is all real numbers.

The range of the tangent function is all real numbers, (-, )

With the tangent function, like the sine and cosine functions, horizontal
stretches/compressions are distinct from vertical stretches/compressions. The horizontal
stretch can typically be determined from the period of the graph. With tangent graphs, it
is often necessary to determine a vertical stretch using a point on the graph.

Example 1
 Find a formula for the function graphed here.

The graph has the shape of a tangent
function, however the period appears to be 8.
We can see one full continuous cycle from -4
to 4, suggesting a horizontal stretch. To
stretch  to 8, the input values would have to
be multiplied by 8 . Since the constant k in

                   

f ( ) = a tan (k ) is the reciprocal of the

horizontal stretch 8 , the equation must have
                     

form
               

f ( ) = a tan   .
               8 

We can also think of this the same way we did with sine and cosine. The period of the

tangent function is  but it has been transformed and now it is 8; remember the ratio of
the "normal period" to the "new period" is  and so this becomes the value on the

                                                     8
inside of the function that tells us how it was horizontally stretched.

To find the vertical stretch a, we can use a point on the graph.  Using the point (2, 2)

        
2 = a tan  2 = a tan  . Since tan  = 1, a = 2.

This function would have a formula f ( ) = 2 tan   .

                                          6 

For the graph of secant, we remember the reciprocal identity where sec( ) = 1 .
                                                                                      cos( )

Notice that the function is undefined when the cosine is 0, leading to a vertical asymptote
in the graph at /2, 3/2, etc. Since the cosine is always no more than one in absolute
value, the secant, being the reciprocal, will always be no less than one in absolute value.
Using technology, we can generate the graph. The graph of the cosine is shown dashed
so you can see the relationship.

f ( ) = sec( ) = 1
                   cos( )

                                                                     
The graph of cosecant is similar. In fact, since sin( ) = cos -   , it follows that

                                                                        2 
               
csc( ) = sec -   , suggesting the cosecant graph is a horizontal shift of the secant
               2 
graph. This graph will be undefined where sine is 0. Recall from the unit circle that this
occurs at 0, , 2, etc. The graph of sine is shown dashed along with the graph of the
cosecant.

 f ( ) = csc( ) = 1

Features of the Graph of Secant and Cosecant
The secant and cosecant graphs have period 2 like the sine and cosine functions.
Secant has domain    + k , where k is an integer

                             2

Cosecant has domain   k , where k is an integer

Both secant and cosecant have range of (-,-1]  [1, )

Example 2
                                       

 Sketch a graph of f ( ) = 2 csc   +1. What is the domain and range of this
                                        2 

 function?

The basic cosecant graph has vertical asymptotes at the integer multiples of . Because

of the factor  inside the cosecant, the graph will be compressed by 2 , so the vertical
2                                           

asymptotes will be compressed to  = 2  k = 2k . In other words, the graph will have
                                             

vertical asymptotes at the integer multiples of 2, and the domain will correspondingly

be   2k , where k is an integer.

The basic sine graph has a range of [-1, 1]. The vertical stretch by 2 will stretch this to
[-2, 2], and the vertical shift up 1 will shift the range of this function to [-1, 3].

The basic cosecant graph has a range of (-,-1]  [1, ) . The vertical stretch by 2 will
stretch this to (-,-2]  [2, ) , and the vertical shift up 1 will shift the range of this
function to (-,-1]  [3, ) .

The resulting graph is shown to the right.

Notice how the graph of the transformed
cosecant relates to the graph of

               
 f ( ) = 2sin    + 1 shown dashed.

                                2 

Finally, we'll look at the graph of cotangent. Based on its definition as the ratio of cosine
to sine, it will be undefined when the sine is zero: at at 0, , 2, etc. The resulting graph
is similar to that of the tangent. In fact, it is a horizontal flip and shift of the tangent
function, as we'll see shortly in the next example.

 Features of the Graph of Cotangent
 The cotangent graph has period 

 Cotangent has domain   k , where k is an integer

 Cotangent has range of all real numbers, (-, )

In Section 6.1 we determined that the sine function was an odd function and the cosine
was an even function by observing the graph and establishing the negative angle
identities for cosine and sine. Similarly, you may notice from its graph that the tangent
function appears to be odd. We can verify this using the negative angle identities for sine
and cosine:

tan(- ) = sin (- ) = - sin ( ) = - tan( )
          cos(- ) cos( )

The secant, like the cosine it is based on, is an even function, while the cosecant, like the
sine, is an odd function.

Section 6.3 Inverse Trig Functions

In previous sections, we have evaluated the trigonometric functions at various angles, but
at times we need to know what angle would yield a specific sine, cosine, or tangent value.
For this, we need inverse functions. Recall that for a one-to-one function, if f (a) = b ,

then an inverse function would satisfy f -1(b) = a .

You probably are already recognizing an issue - that the sine, cosine, and tangent
functions are not one-to-one functions. To define an inverse of these functions, we will
need to restrict the domain of these functions to yield a new function that is one-to-one.
We choose a domain for each function that includes the angle zero.

Sine, limited to -  ,     Cosine, limited to 0,                            
                    2 2                            Tangent, limited to  - , 

                                                                           2 2

On these restricted domains, we can define the inverse sine, inverse cosine, and inverse
tangent functions.

Inverse Sine, Cosine, and Tangent Functions

For angles in the interval -  ,    , if sin( ) = a , then sin -1(a) = 

                               2 2

For angles in the interval 0, , if cos( ) = a , then cos-1(a) = 

                            
For angles in the interval  - ,  , if tan( ) = a , then tan (a) = -1

The sin-1 ( x) is sometimes called the arcsine function, and notated arcsin(a).
The cos-1 ( x) is sometimes called the arccosine function, and notated arccos(a) .
The tan-1 ( x) is sometimes called the arctangent function, and notated arctan(a).

The graphs of the inverse functions are shown here:

sin-1 ( x)               cos-1 ( x)                                tan-1 ( x)

Notice that the output of each of these inverse functions is an angle.

In other words, what angle  would satisfy sin ( ) = 1 ?

                                                                2

There are multiple angles that would satisfy this relationship, such as  and 5 , but
                                                                               6  6

                    -1 1  
answer will be sin   = .

Remember that the inverse is a function so for each input, we will get exactly one
output.

In Section 5.5, we worked with trigonometry on a right triangle to solve for the sides of a
triangle given one side and an additional angle. Using the inverse trig functions, we can
solve for the angles of a right triangle given two sides.

While we could use a similar technique as in the last example, we

will demonstrate a different technique here. From the inside, we

know there is an angle so tan( ) = 7 . We can envision this as the 7

                                           4

opposite and adjacent sides on a right triangle.                   

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the hypotenuse of 4
this triangle:
42 + 72 = hypotenuse 2

hypotenuse = 65

Now, we can represent the sine of the angle as opposite side divided by hypotenuse.

We know there is an angle  so that sin ( ) = x . Using the Pythagorean Theorem,

cos( ) =  9 - x2 =  9 - x2

Since we know that the inverse sine must give an angle on the interval -  ,    , we
                                                                                    2 2

can deduce that the cosine of that angle must be positive. This gives us

Section 6.4 Solving Trig Equations

In Section 6.1, we determined the height of a rider on the London Eye Ferris wheel could

                                                   
be determined by the equation h(t) = -65cos  t  + 70 .

                                                      15 
If we wanted to know length of time during which the rider is more than 100 meters
above ground, we would need to solve equations involving trig functions.

Solving using known values

In the last chapter, we learned sine and cosine values at commonly encountered angles.
We can use these to solve sine and cosine equations involving these common angles.

Example 1

 Solve sin (t ) = 1 for all possible values of t.

                    2

Notice this is asking us to identify all angles, t, that have a sine value of 1 . While
                                                                                         2

evaluating a function always produces one result, solving for an input can yield multiple

solutions. Two solutions should immediately jump to mind from the last chapter:

t =  and t = 5 because they are the common angles on the unit circle with a sin of
    6          6

Looking at a graph confirms that there are more than these two solutions. While eight
are seen on this graph, there are an infinite number of solutions!

Remember that any coterminal angle will also have the same sine value, so any angle
coterminal with these our first two solutions is also a solution. Coterminal angles can
be found by adding full rotations of 2, so we can write the full set of solutions:

t =  + 2k where k is an integer, and t = 5 + 2k where k is an integer.

Example 2

 A circle of radius 5 2 intersects the line x = -5 at two points. Find the angles  on the
 interval 0    2 , where the circle and line intersect.

The x coordinate of a point on a circle can be found as x = r cos( ), so the x coordinate

of points on this circle would be x = 5 2 cos( ). To find where the line x = -5

intersects the circle, we can solve for where the x value on the circle would be -5.

- 5 = 5 2 cos( )     Isolating the cosine

-1 = cos( )          Recall that -1 = - 2 , so we are solving

cos( ) = - 2

 The depth of water at a dock rises and falls with the tide, following the equation

                
  f (t) = 4sin  t  + 7 , where t is measured in hours after midnight. A boat requires a

               12 
 depth of 9 feet to tie up at the dock. Between what times will the depth be 9 feet?

To find when the depth is 9 feet, we need to solve f(t) = 9.

                     Isolating the sine
4sin  t  + 7 = 9

While we know what angles have a sine value of 1 , because of the horizontal

stretch/compression it is less clear how to proceed.

To deal with this, we can make a substitution, defining a new temporary variable u to be

                 1
u = t , so our equation sin  t  = becomes
     12        12  2

sin (u) = 1

          2

From earlier, we saw the solutions to this equation were
u =  + 2k where k is an integer, and

     6
u = 5 + 2k where k is an integer

      6

To undo our substitution, we replace the u in the solutions with u =  t and solve for t.
                                                                                   12

12 6                                    12 6

Dividing by /12, we obtain solutions

t = 2 + 24k where k is an integer, and
t = 10 + 24k where k is an integer.

The depth will be 9 feet and the boat
will be able to approach the dock
between 2am and 10am.

Notice how in both scenarios, the 24k
shows how every 24 hours the cycle will be repeated.

                                                                                       1
In the previous example, looking back at the original simplified equation sin  t  = ,

                                                                                         12  2

we can use the ratio of the "normal period" to the stretch factor to find the period:

2        12 
      = 2   = 24 . Notice that the sine function has a period of 24, which is reflected

in the solutions: there were two unique solutions on one full cycle of the sine function,

and additional solutions were found by adding multiples of a full period.

2. Solve 4sin( 5t) -1 = 1 for all possible values of t.

Solving using the inverse trig functions

Not all equations involve the "special" values of the trig functions to we have learned.
To find the solutions to these equations, we need to use the inverse trig functions.

Example 4

 Use the inverse sine function to find one solution to sin( ) = 0.8.

 Since this is not a known unit circle value, calculating the inverse,  = sin -1(0.8) . This

 requires a calculator and we must approximate a value for this angle. If your calculator
 is in degree mode, your calculator will give you an angle in degrees as the output. If
 your calculator is in radian mode, your calculator will give you an angle in radians. In

 radians,  = sin -1(0.8)  0.927 , or in degrees,  = sin-1 (0.8)  53.130 .

If you are working with a composed trig function and you are not solving for an angle,
you will want to ensure that you are working in radians. In calculus, we will almost
always want to work with radians since they are unit-less.

Notice that the inverse trig functions do exactly what you would expect of any function -
for each input they give exactly one output. While this is necessary for these to be a

function, it means that to find all the solutions to an equation like sin( ) = 0.8, we need

to do more than just evaluate the inverse function.

To find additional solutions, it is good to remember four things:
     The sine is the y-value of a point on the unit circle
     The cosine is the x-value of a point on the unit circle
     The tangent is the slope of a line at a given angle
     Other angles with the same sin/cos/tan will have the same reference angle

Example 5

 Find all solutions to sin( ) = 0.8.

 We would expect two unique angles on one cycle to have this sine value. In the

 previous example, we found one solution to be  = sin -1(0.8)  0.927 . To find the

 other, we need to answer the question "what other angle has the same sine value as an
 angle of 0.927?"
434 Chapter 6

We can think of this as finding all the angles where the y-       0.8
value on the unit circle is 0.8. Drawing a picture of the circle    0.929
helps how the symmetry.
On a unit circle, we would recognize that the second angle                             1
would have the same reference angle and reside in the second
quadrant. This second angle would be located at

 =  - sin -1(0.8) , or approximately    - 0.927 = 2.214 .

To find more solutions we recall that angles coterminal with
these two would have the same sine value, so we can add full
cycles of 2.

 = sin -1(0.8) + 2k and  =  - sin -1(0.8) + 2k where k is an integer,
or approximately,  = 0.927 + 2k and  = 2.214 + 2k where k is an integer.

Example 6

 Find all solutions to sin (x) = - 8 on the interval 0  x  360 .

                                       9

We are looking for the angles with a y-value of -8/9 on the unit
circle. Immediately we can see the solutions will be in the
third and fourth quadrants.

First, we will turn our calculator to degree mode. Using the                            1
                                                -1 8                          -62.7
                                                                  -8/9
inverse, we can find one solution x = sin  -   -62.734 .
                                                   9

While this angle satisfies the equation, it does not lie in the
domain we are looking for. To find the angles in the desired
domain, we start looking for additional solutions.

First, an angle coterminal with - 62.734will have the same sine. By adding a full
rotation, we can find an angle in the desired domain with the same sine.
x = -62.734 + 360 = 297.266

There is a second angle in the desired domain that lies in the third quadrant. Notice that
62.734 is the reference angle for all solutions, so this second solution would be
62.734 past 180
x = 62.734 +180 = 242.734

The two solutions on 0  x  360 are x = 297.266and x = 242.734

Example 7

 Find all solutions to tan(x) = 3 on 0  x  2 .

Using the inverse tangent function, we can find one solution x = tan-1(3)  1.249 .

Unlike the sine and cosine, the tangent function only attains any output value once per
cycle, so there is no second solution in any one cycle.

By adding , a full period of tangent function, we can find          4.391    1.249
a second angle with the same tangent value. Notice this
gives another angle where the line has the same slope.                                  1

If additional solutions were desired, we could continue to
add multiples of , so all solutions would take on the form

x = 1.249 + k , however we are only interested in
0  x  2 .
x = 1.249 +  = 4.391

The two solutions on 0  x  2 are x = 1.249 and x = 4.391.

           3

We're looking for two angles where the x-coordinate on a                     2.301

unit circle is -2/3. A second angle with the same cosine       2                          1
                                                                           -2.301
would be located in the third quadrant. Notice that the        -           or 3.982
                                                                 3

location of this angle could be represented as t = -2.301 .

To represent this as a positive angle we could find a

coterminal angle by adding a full cycle.

t = -2.301 + 2 = 3.982

The equation has two solutions between 0 and 2, at t = 2.301 and t = 3.982.

Example 9

 Solve cos(3t) = 0.2 for all solutions on two cycles, 0  t  4 .

                                                                            3

 As before, with a horizontal compression it can be helpful to make a substitution, u = 3t
 Making this substitution simplifies the equation to a form we have already solved.

 cos(u) = 0.2

 u = cos-1(0.2)  1.369

 A second solution on one cycle would be located in the fourth quadrant with the same
 reference angle.

 u = 2 -1.369 = 4.914

 In this case, we need all solutions on two cycles, so we need to find the solutions on the
 second cycle. We can do this by adding a full rotation to the previous two solutions.
  u = 1.369 + 2 = 7.653
  u = 4.914 + 2 = 11.197

 Undoing the substitution, we obtain our four solutions:
 3t = 1.369, so t = 0.456
 3t = 4.914 so t = 1.638
 3t = 7.653, so t = 2.551
 3t = 11.197, so t = 3.732

u = sin  -   -0.730

This angle is in the fourth quadrant. A second angle with the same sine would be in the
third quadrant with 0.730 as a reference angle:

u =  + 0.730 = 3.871

We can write all solutions to the equation sin (u) = - 2 as

                                                               3
u = -0.730 + 2 k or u = 3.871 + 2 k , where k is an integer.

Undoing our substitution, we can replace u in our solutions with u =  t and solve for t

 t = -0.730 + 2 k or    t = 3.871 + 2 k              Divide by 
t = -0.232 + 2k or     t = 1.232 + 2k

We now can return to the question we began the section with.

Example 11
 The height of a rider on the London Eye Ferris wheel can be determined by the equation

                  
  h(t) = -65cos  t  + 70 . How long is the rider more than 100 meters above ground?

                   15 

To find how long the rider is above 100 meters, we first find the times at which the rider

is at a height of 100 meters by solving h(t) = 100.

                       Isolating the cosine
100 = -65cos  t  + 70

                 15 

               
30 = -65cos  t 

                15 

30                     We make the substitution u =  t
    = cos  t                                                15
-65  15 

30 = cos(u)            Using the inverse, we find one solution

u = cos    2.051
                                                                                       1

                                                                           u = -2.051
This angle is in the second quadrant. A second angle                       or 4.230
with the same cosine would be symmetric in the third
quadrant. This angle could be represented as u = -2.051,
but we need a coterminal positive angle, so we add 2:

u = 2 - 2.051  4.230

Now we can undo the substitution to solve for t
 t = 2.051 so t = 9.793 minutes after the start of the ride
15
 t = 4.230 so t = 20.197 minutes after the start of the ride
15

A rider will be at 100 meters after 9.793 minutes, and again after 20.197 minutes. From
the behavior of the height graph, we know the rider will be above 100 meters between
these times. A rider will be above 100 meters for 20.197 - 9.793 = 10.404 minutes of
the ride.

can find the coterminal solution by adding a full cycle: u = -0.6435 + 2 = 5.6397 .

Another angle with the same sin would be in the third quadrant with the reference

angle 0.6435. u =  + 0.6435 = 3.7851 .

                                 2

Section 6.5 Modeling with Trigonometric Functions

Solving right triangles for angles

In Section 5.5, we used trigonometry on a right triangle to solve for the sides of a triangle
given one side and an additional angle. Using the inverse trig functions, we can solve for
the angles of a right triangle given two sides.

Example 1
 An airplane needs to fly to an airfield located 300 miles east and 200 miles north of its
 current location. At what heading should the airplane fly? In other words, if we ignore
 air resistance or wind speed, how many degrees north of east should the airplane fly?

We might begin by drawing a picture and labeling all of

the known information. Drawing a triangle, we see we                                 200
are looking for the angle . In this triangle, the side              
opposite the angle  is 200 miles and the side adjacent
is 300 miles. Since we know the values for the                          300

opposite and adjacent sides, it makes sense to use the

tangent function.

tan( ) = 200       Using the inverse,
           300

         -1 200 
 = tan    0.588 , or equivalently about 33.7 degrees.

            300 

The airplane needs to fly at a heading of 33.7 degrees north of east.

Example 2

 OSHA safety regulations require that the base of a ladder be placed 1 foot from the wall
 for every 4 feet of ladder length3. Find the angle such a ladder forms with the ground.

For any length of ladder, the base needs to be one quarter of the distance

the foot of the ladder is away from the wall. Equivalently, if the base is

a feet from the wall, the ladder can be 4a feet long. Since a is the side    4a

adjacent to the angle and 4a is the hypotenuse, we use the cosine function.

cos( ) = a = 1 Using the inverse 
4a 4                                                                             a

1. A cable that anchors the center of the London Eye Ferris wheel to the ground must be

    second anchor on the ground is 23 meters from the base of the wheel. What is the
    angle from the ground up to the center of the Ferris wheel and how long is the cable?

Example 3
 In a video game design, a map shows the location of other characters relative to the
 player, who is situated at the origin, and the direction they are facing. A character
 currently shows on the map at coordinates (-3, 5). If the player rotates
 counterclockwise by 20 degrees, then the objects in the map will correspondingly rotate
 20 degrees clockwise. Find the new coordinates of the character.

 To rotate the position of the character, we can imagine it as
 a point on a circle, and we will change the angle of the
 point by 20 degrees. To do so, we first need to find the
 radius of this circle and the original angle.

 Drawing a right triangle inside the circle, we can find the
 radius using the Pythagorean Theorem:

 (-3)2 + 52 = r2

  r = 9 + 25 = 34

 To find the angle, we need to decide first if we are going to find the acute angle of the
 triangle, the reference angle, or if we are going to find the angle measured in standard
 position. While either approach will work, in this case we will do the latter. Since for
 any point on a circle we know x = r cos( ) , using our given information we get
  - 3 = 34 cos( )

   - 3 = cos( )
    34
  = cos -1   - 3   120.964

              34 
 While there are two angles that have this cosine value, the angle of 120.964 degrees is
 in the second quadrant as desired, so it is the angle we were looking for.

 Rotating the point clockwise by 20 degrees, the angle of the point will decrease to
 100.964 degrees. We can then evaluate the coordinates of the rotated point
  x = 34 cos(100.964)  -1.109
  y = 34 sin(100.964)  5.725

 The coordinates of the character on the rotated map will be (-1.109, 5.725).

Modeling with sinusoidal functions

Many modeling situations involve functions that are periodic. Previously we learned that
sinusoidal functions are a special type of periodic function. Problems that involve
quantities that oscillate can often be modeled by a sine or cosine function and once we
create a suitable model for the problem we can use that model to answer various
questions.

Example 4

 The hours of daylight in Seattle oscillate from a low of 8.5 hours in January to a high of
 16 hours in July4. When should you plant a garden if you want to do it during a month
 where there are 14 hours of daylight?

To model this, we first note that the hours of daylight oscillate with a period of 12
months. B = 2 =  corresponds to the horizontal stretch, found by using the ratio of

                 12 6
the original period to the new period.

With a low of 8.5 and a high of 16, the midline will be halfway between these values, at
16 + 8.5 = 12.25 .

    2
The amplitude will be half the difference
between the highest and lowest values:
16 - 8.5 = 3.75 , or equivalently the

    2
distance from the midline to the high or
low value, 16-12.25=3.75.

Letting January be t = 0, the graph starts
at the lowest value, so it can be modeled
as a flipped cosine graph. Putting this
together, we get a model:

                   
h(t) = -3.75 cos t  + 12.25

                   6 

h(t) is our model for hours of day light t months after January.

To find when there will be 14 hours of daylight, we solve h(t) = 14.

                           Isolating the cosine
14 = -3.75 cos t  + 12.25

                                 multiplying by the reciprocal
                   6             t=3.927 months past January

6            3.75 

t = 2.0563  6 = 3.927
             

There will be 14 hours of daylight 3.927 months into the year, or near the end of April.

While there would be a second time in the year when there are 14 hours of daylight,
since we are planting a garden, we would want to know the first solution, in spring, so
we do not need to find the second solution in this case.

Example 6
 An object is connected to the wall with a spring that has a
 natural length of 20 cm. The object is pulled back 8 cm past
 the natural length and released. The object oscillates 3 times
 per second. Find an equation for the horizontal position of the
 object ignoring the effects of friction. How much time during each cycle is the object
 more than 27 cm from the wall?

 If we use the distance from the wall, x, as the desired output, then the object will
 oscillate equally on either side of the spring's natural length of 20, putting the midline
 of the function at 20 cm.

 If we release the object 8 cm past the natural length, the amplitude of the oscillation will
 be 8 cm.

 We are beginning at the largest value and so this function can most easily be modeled
 using a cosine function.
                    Section 6.5 Modeling with Trigonometric Functions 445

Since the object oscillates 3 times per second, it has a frequency of 3 and the period of
one oscillation is 1/3 of second. Using this we find the horizontal compression using the
ratios of the periods: 2 = 6 .

                          1/ 3

Using all this, we can build our model:

x(t) = 8cos(6t)+ 20

To find when the object is 27 cm from the wall, we can solve x(t) = 27

27 = 8cos(6t)+ 20   Isolating the cosine

7 = 8cos(6t)

7 = cos(6 t )       Using the inverse

            -1 7 
6 t = cos    0.505

              8

t = 0.505 = 0.0268
     6

Based on the shape of the graph, we can conclude
that the object will spend the first 0.0268 seconds
more than 27 cm from the wall. Based on the
symmetry of the function, the object will spend
another 0.0268 seconds more than 27 cm from the
wall at the end of the cycle. Altogether, the object
spends 0.0536 seconds each cycle at a distance
greater than 27 cm from the wall.

In some problems, we can use trigonometric functions to model behaviors more
complicated than the basic sinusoidal function.

Example 7                                                   A  10 cm

 A rigid rod with length 10 cm is attached            4cm                 B
 to a circle of radius 4cm at point A as
 shown here. The point B is able to freely                
 move along the horizontal axis, driving a
 piston5. If the wheel rotates
 counterclockwise at 5 revolutions per
 second, find the location of point B as a
 function of time. When will the point B
 be 12 cm from the center of the circle?

5 For an animation of this situation, see https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bmc9whd6in
446 Chapter 6

To find the position of point B, we can begin by finding the coordinates of point A.
Since it is a point on a circle with radius 4, we can express its coordinates as
(4 cos( ),4sin( )) , where  is the angle shown.

The angular velocity is 5 revolutions per second, or equivalently 10 radians per
second. After t seconds, the wheel will rotate by  = 10 t radians. Substituting this,

we can find the coordinates of A in terms of t.
(4 cos(10 t),4sin(10 t))

Notice that this is the same value we would have obtained by observing that the period
of the rotation is 1/5 of a second and calculating the stretch/compression factor:
"original" 2 = 10 .

   "new" 15

Now that we have the coordinates of the point A,    A
we can relate this to the point B. By drawing a              10 cm
vertical line segment from A to the horizontal                          B
axis, we can form a right triangle. The height of
the triangle is the y coordinate of the point A:            b
4sin(10 t) .

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the base length of the triangle:

(4sin(10 t))2 + b2 = 102

b2 =100 -16sin2(10 t)

b = 100 -16sin2 (10 t)

Looking at the x coordinate of the point A, we can see that the triangle we drew is
shifted to the right of the y axis by 4 cos(10 t) . Combining this offset with the length
of the base of the triangle gives the x coordinate of the point B:

x(t) = 4cos(10 t) + 100 -16sin2 (10 t)

To solve for when the point B will be 12 cm from the center of the circle, we need to
solve x(t) = 12.

12 = 4cos(10 t) + 100 -16sin2(10 t)                 Isolate the square root

12 - 4cos(10 t) = 100 -16sin2(10 t)                 Square both sides
                                                    Expand the left side
(12 - 4cos(10 t))2 = 100 -16sin2(10 t)              Move all terms to the left
                                                    Factor out 16
144 - 96cos(10 t) +16cos2(10 t) =100 -16sin2(10 t)
44 - 96cos(10 t) +16cos2(10 t) +16sin2(10 t) = 0

44 - 96cos(10 t) +16(cos2(10 t) + sin2(10 t)) = 0
                              Section 6.5 Modeling with Trigonometric Functions 447

At this point, we can utilize the Pythagorean Identity, which tells us that

cos2(10 t) + sin2(10 t) =1.

Using this identity, our equation simplifies to

44 - 96 cos(10 t) +16 = 0        Combine the constants and move to the right side
-96 cos(10 t) = -60              Divide
                                 Make a substitution
cos(10 t) = 60
               96                By symmetry we can find a second solution
                                 Undoing the substitution
cos(u) = 60
           96

         -1 60 
u = cos    0.896

            96 

u = 2 - 0.896 = 5.388

10 t = 0.896 , so t = 0.0285
10 t = 5.388 , so t = 0.1715

The point B will be 12 cm from the center of the circle 0.0285 seconds after the process
begins, 0.1715 seconds after the process begins, and every 1/5 of a second after each of
those values.

In the last two chapters we have used basic definitions and relationships to simplify
trigonometric expressions and solve trigonometric equations. In this chapter we will look
at more complex relationships. By conducting a deeper study of trigonometric identities
we can learn to simplify complicated expressions, allowing us to solve more interesting
applications.

Section 7.1 Solving Trigonometric Equations with Identities

In the last chapter, we solved basic trigonometric equations. In this section, we explore
the techniques needed to solve more complicated trig equations. Building from what we
already know makes this a much easier task.

Consider the function f (x) = 2x2 + x . If you were asked to solve f (x) = 0 , it requires

simple algebra:       Factor
2x2 + x = 0

x(2x + 1) = 0         Giving solutions

x = 0 or x = - 1
                   2

Similarly, for g(t) = sin(t) , if we asked you to solve g(t) = 0 , you can solve this using

unit circle values:
sin( t) = 0 for t = 0,  , 2 and so on.

Using these same concepts, we consider the composition of these two functions:
 f (g(t)) = 2(sin( t))2 + (sin( t)) = 2sin 2 (t) + sin( t)

This creates an equation that is a polynomial trig function. With these types of functions,
we use algebraic techniques like factoring and the quadratic formula, along with
trigonometric identities and techniques, to solve equations.

As a reminder, here are some of the essential trigonometric identities that we have
learned so far:

Example 1

 Solve 2sin 2 (t) + sin( t) = 0 for all solutions with 0  t  2 .

This equation kind of looks like a quadratic equation, but with sin(t) in place of an
algebraic variable (we often call such an equation "quadratic in sine"). As with all
quadratic equations, we can use factoring techniques or the quadratic formula. This
expression factors nicely, so we proceed by factoring out the common factor of sin(t):

sin(t)(2sin(t) +1) = 0

Using the zero product theorem, we know that the product on the left will equal zero if
either factor is zero, allowing us to break this equation into two cases:
sin( t) = 0 or 2 sin( t) + 1 = 0

We can solve each of these equations independently, using our knowledge of special

angles.

sin( t) = 0       2 sin( t) + 1 = 0

t = 0 or t =      sin( t) = - 1
                              2

                  t = 7 or t = 11
                          6          6

Together, this gives us four solutions to

the equation on 0  t  2 :

t = 0, , 7 , 11
           66

We could check these answers are
reasonable by graphing the function and comparing the zeros.
                   Section 7.1 Solving Trigonometric Equations and Identities 455

Example 2

 Solve 3sec2 (t) - 5sec(t) - 2 = 0 for all solutions with 0  t  2 .

Since the left side of this equation is quadratic in secant, we can try to factor it, and
hope it factors nicely.

If it is easier to for you to consider factoring without the trig function present, consider
using a substitution u = sec(t) , resulting in 3u 2 - 5u - 2 = 0 , and then try to factor:
3u2 - 5u - 2 = (3u +1)(u - 2)

Undoing the substitution,
(3sec(t) + 1)(sec(t) - 2) = 0

Since we have a product equal to zero, we break it into the two cases and solve each
separately.

3sec(t) + 1 = 0                   Isolate the secant
sec(t) = - 1                      Rewrite as a cosine
                                  Invert both sides
            3
  1 =-1
cos(t) 3
cos(t) = -3

Since the cosine has a range of [-1, 1], the cosine will never take on an output of -3.
There are no solutions to this case.

Continuing with the second case,

sec(t) - 2 = 0                    Isolate the secant
                                  Rewrite as a cosine
sec(t) = 2                        Invert both sides

  1 =2                            This gives two solutions
cos(t)

cos(t) = 1
          2

t =  or t = 5
3               3

These are the only two solutions on the interval.
By utilizing technology to graph
 f (t) = 3sec2(t) - 5sec(t) - 2 , a look at a graph

confirms there are only two zeros for this function on
the interval [0, 2), which assures us that we didn't
miss anything.

1. Solve 2sin 2 (t) + 3sin( t) +1 = 0 for all solutions with 0  t  2 .

When solving some trigonometric equations, it becomes necessary to first rewrite the
equation using trigonometric identities. One of the most common is the Pythagorean
Identity, sin 2 ( ) + cos 2 ( ) = 1 which allows you to rewrite sin 2 ( ) in terms of cos2 ( )
or vice versa,

 Identities
 Alternate Forms of the Pythagorean Identity
  sin2 ( ) = 1- cos2 ( )
  cos2 ( ) = 1- sin2 ( )

These identities become very useful whenever an equation involves a combination of sine
and cosine functions.

Example 3

 Solve 2sin 2 (t) - cos(t) = 1 for all solutions with 0  t  2 .

Since this equation has a mix of sine and cosine functions, it becomes more complicated
to solve. It is usually easier to work with an equation involving only one trig function.
This is where we can use the Pythagorean Identity.

2sin 2 (t) - cos(t) = 1      Using sin 2 ( ) = 1- cos 2 ( )
                             Distributing the 2
2(1- cos2 (t))- cos(t) = 1

2 - 2cos2 (t) - cos(t) = 1

Since this is now quadratic in cosine, we rearrange the equation so one side is zero and

factor.

- 2cos2 (t) - cos(t) +1 = 0  Multiply by -1 to simplify the factoring

2cos2 (t) + cos(t) -1 = 0    Factor

(2cos(t) -1)(cos(t) +1) = 0

This product will be zero if either factor is zero, so we can break this into two separate
cases and solve each independently.

2 cos(t) -1 = 0     or         cos(t) + 1 = 0

2. Solve 2sin 2 (t) = 3cos(t) for all solutions with 0  t  2 .

In addition to the Pythagorean Identity, it is often necessary to rewrite the tangent, secant,
cosecant, and cotangent as part of solving an equation.

Example 4

 Solve tan( x) = 3sin( x) for all solutions with 0  x  2 .

With a combination of tangent and sine, we might try rewriting tangent
tan( x) = 3sin( x)

sin( x) = 3sin( x)             Multiplying both sides by cosine
cos( x)

sin( x) = 3sin( x) cos( x)

At this point, you may be tempted to divide both sides of the equation by sin(x). Resist
the urge. When we divide both sides of an equation by a quantity, we are assuming the
quantity is never zero. In this case, when sin(x) = 0 the equation is satisfied, so we'd
lose those solutions if we divided by the sine.

To avoid this problem, we can rearrange the equation so that one side is zero1.

sin( x) - 3sin( x) cos(x) = 0  Factoring out sin(x) from both parts

sin( x)(1- 3cos(x)) = 0

From here, we can see we get solutions when sin( x) = 0 or 1 - 3cos(x) = 0 .

Using our knowledge of the special angles of the unit circle,
sin( x) = 0 when x = 0 or x = .

1 You technically can divide by sin(x), as long as you separately consider the case where sin(x) = 0. Since
it is easy to forget this step, the factoring approach used in the example is recommended.

Section 7.2 Addition and Subtraction Identities

In this section, we begin expanding our repertoire of trigonometric identities.

 Identities
 The sum and difference identities
  cos( -  ) = cos( ) cos( ) + sin( ) sin(  )
  cos( +  ) = cos( ) cos( ) - sin( ) sin(  )
  sin( +  ) = sin( ) cos( ) + cos( ) sin(  )
  sin( -  ) = sin( ) cos( ) - cos( ) sin(  )

We will prove the difference of angles identity for cosine. The rest of the identities can
be derived from this one.

Proof of the difference of angles identity for cosine

Consider two points on a unit circle:

P at an angle of  from the positive x axis with coordinates (cos(),sin()) , and Q at C

an angle of  with coordinates                          P

(cos(),sin( )).                                                                               Q

Notice the measure of angle POQ is  - .                                                  -
Label two more points:
C at an angle of  - , with coordinates                                                        D

(cos( - ),sin( - )),                                                                    O

D at the point (1, 0).

Notice that the distance from C to D is the
same as the distance from P to Q because
triangle COD is a rotation of triangle POQ.

Using the distance formula to find the distance from P to Q yields

 (cos( ) - cos( ))2 + (sin( ) - sin(  ))2

Expanding this
  cos 2 ( ) - 2cos( ) cos( ) + cos 2 ( ) + sin 2 ( ) - 2sin( )sin(  ) + sin 2 ( )
462 Chapter 7

Applying the Pythagorean Identity and simplifying
  2 - 2 cos( ) cos( ) - 2sin( ) sin(  )

Similarly, using the distance formula to find the distance from C to D

 (cos( -  ) -1)2 + (sin( -  ) - 0)2

Expanding this
  cos 2 ( -  ) - 2cos( -  ) +1+ sin 2 ( -  )

Applying the Pythagorean Identity and simplifying
  - 2 cos( -  ) + 2

Since the two distances are the same we set these two formulas equal to each other and
simplify

  2 - 2 cos( ) cos( ) - 2sin( ) sin(  ) = - 2 cos( -  ) + 2
2 - 2 cos( ) cos( ) - 2sin( ) sin(  ) = -2 cos( -  ) + 2
cos( ) cos( ) + sin( ) sin(  ) = cos( -  )

This establishes the identity.

1. By writing cos( +  ) as cos( - (-  )), show the sum of angles identity for cosine

    follows from the difference of angles identity proven above.

The sum and difference of angles identities are often used to rewrite expressions in other
forms, or to rewrite an angle in terms of simpler angles.

Example 1
 Find the exact value of cos(75) .

Since 75 = 30 + 45, we can evaluate cos(75) as

cos(75) = cos(30 + 45)              Apply the cosine sum of angles identity

= 2 sin (x) - 2 cos(x)
2                2

Additionally, these identities can be used to simplify expressions or prove new identities

Example 3
 Prove sin( a + b) = tan(a) + tan(b) .
         sin( a - b) tan(a) - tan(b)

As with any identity, we need to first decide which side to begin with. Since the left
side involves sum and difference of angles, we might start there

sin( a + b)                                Apply the sum and difference of angle identities
sin( a - b)
= sin( a) cos(b) + cos(a)sin( b)

  sin( a) cos(b) - cos(a)sin( b)

Since it is not immediately obvious how to proceed, we might start on the other side,
and see if the path is more apparent.

tan(a) + tan(b)                            Rewriting the tangents using the tangent identity
tan(a) - tan(b)
464 Chapter 7

   sin( a) + sin( b)                  Multiplying the top and bottom by cos(a)cos(b)
= cos(a) cos(b)

   sin( a) - sin( b)
  cos(a) cos(b)

    sin( a) sin( b) 
        +              cos(a) cos(b)
    cos(a) cos(b) 
=                                     Distributing and simplifying
    sin( a) sin( b) 
        -              cos(a) cos(b)
    cos(a) cos(b) 

= sin(a) cos(b) + sin(b) cos(a)       From above, we recognize this
  sin(a) cos(b) - sin(b) cos(a)

= sin( a + b)                         Establishing the identity
  sin( a - b)

These identities can also be used to solve equations.

Example 4
 Solve sin( x) sin( 2x) + cos( x) cos(2x) = 3 .
                                                   2

By recognizing the left side of the equation as the result of the difference of angles
identity for cosine, we can simplify the equation

sin( x) sin( 2x) + cos( x) cos(2x) = 3      Apply the difference of angles identity
                                         2

cos( x - 2x) = 3
                  2

cos(-x) = 3                                 Use the negative angle identity
             2

cos(x) = 3
           2

Since this is a special cosine value we recognize from the unit circle, we can quickly

write the answers:

x =  + 2k
     6
                , where k is an integer
x = 11 + 2k

Combining Waves of Equal Period
A sinusoidal function of the form f (x) = Asin( Bx + C) can be rewritten using the sum of
angles identity.

Example 5
                           

 Rewrite f (x) = 4sin 3x +  as a sum of sine and cosine.
                            3

                                             Using the sum of angles identity
4sin 3x +                                    Evaluate the sine and cosine
                                             Distribute and simplify
      3

                               
= 4sin (3x)cos  + cos(3x)sin 
               3               3 

= 4sin (3x) 1 + cos(3x)  3 
            2              2

= 2sin (3x) + 2 3 cos(3x)

Notice that the result is a stretch of the sine added to a different stretch of the cosine, but
both have the same horizontal compression, which results in the same period.

We might ask now whether this process can be reversed - can a combination of a sine
and cosine of the same period be written as a single sinusoidal function? To explore this,
we will look in general at the procedure used in the example above.

f (x) = Asin( Bx + C)                        Use the sum of angles identity
                                                      Distribute the A
= A(sin( Bx)cos(C) + cos(Bx)sin(C))
                                             Rearrange the terms a bit
= Asin( Bx) cos(C) + Acos(Bx) sin( C)
= Acos(C) sin( Bx) + Asin( C) cos(Bx)

Based on this result, if we have an expression of the form m sin( Bx) + n cos(Bx) , we

could rewrite it as a single sinusoidal function if we can find values A and C so that
m sin( Bx) + n cos(Bx) = Acos(C) sin( Bx) + Asin( C) cos(Bx) , which will require that:

m = Acos(C)                                  m = cos(C)
                  which can be rewritten as  A
                                             n = sin( C)
n = Asin( C)                                 A

To find A,
466 Chapter 7

m2 + n2 = (Acos(C))2 + (Asin( C))2  Apply the Pythagorean Identity and simplify

= A2 cos2 (C) + A2 sin 2 (C)

= A2 (cos2 (C) + sin 2 (C))

= A2

Rewriting a Sum of Sine and Cosine as a Single Sine

To rewrite m sin( Bx) + n cos(Bx) as Asin( Bx + C)

A2 = m2 + n2 , cos(C) = m , and sin( C) = n
                A                   A

You can use either of the last two equations to solve for possible values of C. Since
there will usually be two possible solutions, we will need to look at both to determine
which quadrant C is in and determine which solution for C satisfies both equations.

Example 6
 Rewrite 4 3 sin( 2x) - 4 cos(2x) as a single sinusoidal function.

Using the formulas above, A2 = (4 3)2 + (- 4)2 = 16  3 +16 = 64 , so A = 8.

Solving for C,

cos(C) = 4 3 = 3 , so C =  or C = 11 .
  82               6                6

However, notice sin( C) = - 4 = - 1 . Sine is negative in the third and fourth quadrant,
                                 82

so the angle that works for both is C = 11 .
                                                 6

function provides an approach for solving some equations.
                                  Section 7.2 Addition and Subtraction Identities 467

Example 7
 Solve 3sin( 2x) + 4 cos(2x) = 1 to find two positive solutions.

Since the sine and cosine have the same period, we can rewrite them as a single
sinusoidal function.

A2 = (3)2 + (4)2 = 25 , so A = 5

3            -1  3 
cos(C) = , so C = cos    0.927 or C = 2 - 0.927 = 5.356
5            5

Since sin( C) = 4 , a positive value, we need the angle in the first quadrant, C = 0.927.
                  5

Using this, our equation becomes  Divide by 5
                                  Make the substitution u = 2x + 0.927
5sin(2x + 0.927) = 1              The inverse gives a first solution
                                  By symmetry, the second solution is
sin (2x + 0.927 ) = 1             A third solution would be

sin (u) = 1

           5

u =  - 0.201 = 2.940
u = 2 + 0.201 = 6.485

Undoing the substitution, we can find two positive solutions for x.

2x + 0.927 = 0.201 or 2x + 0.927 = 2.940 or 2x + 0.927 = 6.485

2x = -0.726  2x = 2.013           2x = 5.558

x = -0.363   x = 1.007            x = 2.779

Since the first of these is negative, we eliminate it and keep the two positive solutions,
x = 1.007 and x = 2.779 .

sin( -  ) = sin( ) cos( ) - cos( ) sin(  )

Adding these two equations, we obtain
sin( +  ) + sin( -  ) = 2sin( ) cos( )

Dividing by 2, we establish the identity

sin( ) cos( ) = 1 (sin( +  ) + sin( -  ))

                    2

Example 8
 Write sin( 2t) sin( 4t) as a sum or difference.

Using the product-to-sum identity for a product of sines

sin( 2t) sin( 4t) = 1 (cos(2t - 4t) - cos(2t + 4t))

                    2

= 1 (cos(-2t) - cos(6t))  If desired, apply the negative angle identity

We will again prove one of these and leave the rest as an exercise.

Proof of the sum-to-product identity for sine functions
We define two new variables:
u = +
v= -

Adding these equations yields u + v = 2 , giving  = u + v

                                                                     2
Subtracting the equations yields u - v = 2 , or  = u - v

                                                                  2

Substituting these expressions into the product-to-sum identity

sin( ) cos( ) = 1 (sin( +  ) + sin( -  )) gives

                   2

   u+v u-v 1                                     Multiply by 2 on both sides

Example 11

 Solve sin ( t ) + sin (3 t ) = cos( t) for all solutions with 0  t  2 .

In an equation like th is, it is not immediately obvious how to proceed. One option
would be to combine the two sine functions on the left side of the equation. Another
would be to move the cosine to the left side of the equation, and combine it with one of
the sines. For no particularly good reason, we'll begin by combining the sines on the
left side of the equation and see how things work out.

sin ( t ) + sin (3 t ) = cos( t)              Apply the sum to product identity on the left

  t + 3 t    t - 3 t               = cos( t)  Simplify

                                              Factor out the cosine
2sin (2 t ) cos (- t ) = cos( t)

2sin (2 t ) cos ( t ) = cos( t)

2sin (2 t ) cos ( t ) - cos( t) = 0

cos ( t )(2sin (2 t ) -1) = 0

Using the Zero Product Theorem we know that at least one of the two factors must be

zero. The first factor, cos ( t ) , has period P = 2 = 2 , so the solution interval of

cos ( t ) = 0                                 Substitute u =  t

cos(u) = 0                                    On one cycle, this has solutions

The second factor, 2sin (2 t ) -1, has period of P = 2 = 1, so the solution interval

Section 7.3 Double Angle Identities

Two special cases of the sum of angles identities arise often enough that we choose to
state these identities separately.

Identities
The double angle identities
sin( 2 ) = 2sin( ) cos( )

cos(2 ) = cos 2 ( ) - sin 2 ( )
            = 1 - 2sin 2 ( )
            = 2 cos 2 ( ) -1

These identities follow from the sum of angles identities.

1. Show cos(2) = cos2 () - sin 2 () by using the sum of angles identity for cosine.

For the cosine double angle identity, there are three forms of the identity stated because
the basic form, cos(2) = cos2 () - sin 2 () , can be rewritten using the Pythagorean

Identity. Rearranging the Pythagorean Identity results in the equality
cos2 () = 1- sin 2 () , and by substituting this into the basic double angle identity, we

obtain the second form of the double angle identity.

cos(2 ) = cos 2 ( ) - sin 2 ( )     Substituting using the Pythagorean identity
cos(2 ) = 1- sin 2 ( ) - sin 2 ( )  Simplifying
cos(2) = 1- 2sin 2 ()

To evaluate cos(2 ) , since we know the value for sin( ) we can use the version of the

double angle that only involves sine.

                            32         18 7
cos(2 ) = 1 - 2sin 2 ( ) = 1 - 2  = 1 - =
                           5           25 25

Since the double angle for sine involves both sine and cosine, we'll need to first find
cos( ) , which we can do using the Pythagorean Identity.

sin 2 ( ) + cos 2 ( ) = 1

3  2

  + cos ( ) = 12

cos 2 ( ) = 1 - 9
                25

cos( ) =  16 =  4
              25 5

Since  is in the second quadrant, we know that cos() < 0, so
cos( ) = - 4

             5

Now we can evaluate the sine double angle
                                   3  4  24

sin( 2 ) = 2sin( ) cos( ) = 2  -  = -

 a) 2cos 2 (12) -1

a) Notice that the expression is in the same form as one version of the double angle
identity for cosine: cos(2 ) = 2cos2 ( ) -1. Using this,

2cos2 (12) -1 = cos(2 12) = cos(24)

b) This expression looks similar to the result of the double angle identity for sine.

We can use the double angle identities to simplify expressions and prove identities.

Example 2
 Simplify cos(2t) .
             cos(t) - sin( t)

With three choices for how to rewrite the double angle, we need to consider which will
be the most useful. To simplify this expression, it would be great if the denominator
would cancel with something in the numerator, which would require a factor of
cos(t) - sin( t) in the numerator, which is most likely to occur if we rewrite the

numerator with a mix of sine and cosine.

    cos(2t)                             Apply the double angle identity
                                        Factor the numerator
cos(t) - sin( t)                        Cancelling the common factor
= cos2 (t) - sin 2 (t)                  Resulting in the most simplified form

   cos(t) - sin( t)

= (cos(t) - sin( t))(cos(t) + sin( t))

             cos(t) - sin( t)
= cos(t) + sin( t)

terms, invert and multiply, then simplify. Alternatively, we can multiple both the top
and bottom by cos 2 ( ) , the common denominator:

2. Use an identity to find the exact value of cos2 (75) - sin 2 (75).

As with other identities, we can also use the double angle identities for solving equations.

Example 4

 Solve cos(2t) = cos(t) for all solutions with 0  t  2 .

In general when solving trig equations, it makes things more complicated when we have

a mix of sines and cosines and when we have a mix of functions with different periods.

In this case, we can use a double angle identity to rewrite the cos(2t). When choosing

which form of the double angle identity to use, we notice that we have a cosine on the

right side of the equation. We try to limit our equation to one trig function, which we

can do by choosing the version of the double angle formula for cosine that only

involves cosine.

cos(2t) = cos(t)             Apply the double angle identity

2cos 2 (t) -1 = cos(t)       This is quadratic in cosine, so make one side 0

2cos2 (t) - cos(t) -1 = 0    Factor

(2cos(t) +1)(cos(t) -1) = 0  Break this apart to solve each part separately

2 cos(t) + 1 = 0        or   cos(t) -1 = 0
                             cos(t) = 1
cos(t) = - 1 or
            2                t =0

t = 2 or t = 4 or
   3              3

Looking at a graph of cos(2t) and cos(t) shown
together, we can verify that these three solutions on [0, 2) seem reasonable.

Example 5
 A cannonball is fired with velocity of 100 meters per second. If it is launched at an
 angle of , the vertical component of the velocity will be 100 sin( ) and the horizontal
 component will be 100 cos( ) . Ignoring wind resistance, the height of the cannonball
 will follow the equation h(t) = -4.9t 2 +100 sin( )t and horizontal position will follow
 the equation x(t) = 100 cos( )t . If you want to hit a target 900 meters away, at what
 angle should you aim the cannon?

To hit the target 900 meters away, we want x(t) = 900 at the time when the cannonball
hits the ground, when h(t) = 0 . To solve this problem, we will first solve for the time,

t, when the cannonball hits the ground. Our answer will depend upon the angle .

h(t) = 0                           Factor
- 4.9t 2 +100 sin( )t = 0          Break this apart to find two solutions

t(- 4.9t +100sin()) = 0

t = 0 or  - 4.9t + 100 sin( ) = 0  Solve for t
          - 4.9t = -100 sin( )
          t = 100 sin( )

                  4.9

This shows that the height is 0 twice, once at t = 0 when the cannonball is fired, and
again when the cannonball hits the ground after flying through the air. This second

value of t gives the time when the ball hits the ground in terms of the angle  . We

want the horizontal distance x(t) to be 900 when the ball hits the ground, in other words
when t = 100 sin( ) .

                4.9

Since the target is 900 m away we start with

x(t) = 900                         Use the formula for x(t)
                                   Substitute the desired time, t from above
100 cos( )t = 900                  Simplify
                                   Isolate the cosine and sine product
100 cos( ) 100 sin( ) = 900

cos( ) sin( ) = 2 900(4.9)

The left side of this equation almost looks like the result of the double angle identity for

sine: sin(2 ) = 2sin( )cos( ) .

Multiplying both sides of our equation by 2,

2cos( )sin( ) = 2 2(900)(4.9)  Using the double angle identity on the left

Power Reduction and Half Angle Identities

Another use of the cosine double angle identities is to use them in reverse to rewrite a

squared sine or cosine in terms of the double angle. Starting with one form of the cosine

double angle identity:

cos(2 ) = 2cos 2 ( ) -1        Isolate the cosine squared term

cos(2 ) +1 = 2cos 2 ( )        Add 1

cos 2 ( ) = cos(2 ) + 1        Divide by 2
                   2

cos 2 ( ) = cos(2 ) + 1        This is called a power reduction identity

3. Use another form of the cosine double angle identity to prove the identity

   sin 2 ( ) = 1 - cos(2 ) .
                      2

The cosine double angle identities can also be used in reverse for evaluating angles that
are half of a common angle. Building from our formula cos 2 ( ) = cos(2 ) + 1 , if we let

                                                                                        2

                                           2    cos( ) + 1
 = 2 , then  = this identity becomes cos   =                . Taking the square

Section 7.4 Modeling Changing Amplitude and Midline

While sinusoidal functions can model a variety of behaviors, it is often necessary to
combine sinusoidal functions with linear and exponential curves to model real
applications and behaviors. We begin this section by looking at changes to the midline of
a sinusoidal function. Recall that the midline describes the middle, or average value, of
the sinusoidal function.

Changing Midlines

Example 1
 A population of elk currently averages 2000 elk, and that average has been growing by
 4% each year. Due to seasonal fluctuation, the population oscillates from 50 below
 average in the winter up to 50 above average in the summer. Find a function that
 models the number of elk after t years, starting in the winter.

 There are two components to the behavior of the elk population: the changing average,
 and the oscillation. The average is an exponential growth, starting at 2000 and growing
 by 4% each year. Writing a formula for this:
  average = initial(1+ r)t = 2000(1+ 0.04)t

 For the oscillation, since the population oscillates 50 above and below average, the
 amplitude will be 50. Since it takes one year for the population to cycle, the period is 1.
 We find the value of the horizontal stretch coefficient B = original period = 2 = 2 .

                                                                        new period 1

 The function starts in winter, so the shape of the function will be a negative cosine,
 since it starts at the lowest value.

 Putting it all together, the equation would be:
  P(t) = -50 cos(2 t) + midline

 Since the midline represents the average population, we substitute in the exponential
 function into the population equation to find our final equation:
  P(t) = -50cos(2 t) + 2000(1+ 0.04)t

This is an example of changing midline - in this case an exponentially changing midline.

A function of the form f (t) = Asin( Bt) + g(t) will oscillate above and below the
average given by the function g(t).

Changing midlines can be exponential, linear, or any other type of function. Here are
some examples:

Linear midline        Exponential midline                    Quadratic midline

f (t) = Asin ( Bt ) + (mt + b) f (t) = Asin ( Bt ) + (abt )  f (t) = Asin ( Bt ) + (at 2 )

Example 2                                                                    that will pass
 Find a function with linear midline of the form  f (t) = Asin  t  + mt + b
 through the points given below.
                                                               2 

t               0  1  2  3

f(t)            5  10 9  8

Since we are given the value of the horizontal compression coefficient we can calculate
the period of this function: new period = original period = 2 = 4 .

                                                       B 2

Since the sine function is at the midline at the beginning of a cycle and halfway through
a cycle, we would expect this function to be at the midline at t = 0 and t = 2, since 2 is
half the full period of 4. Based on this, we expect the points (0, 5) and (2, 9) to be
points on the midline. We can clearly see that this is not a constant function and so we
use the two points to calculate a linear function: midline = mt + b . From these two
points we can calculate a slope:
m= 9-5 = 4 =2

      2-0 2

Combining this with the initial value of 5, we have the midline: midline = 2t + 5.
490 Chapter 7

                                                     
The full function will have form f (t) = Asin  t  + 2t + 5 . To find the amplitude, we

                                                       2 

can plug in a point we haven't already used, such as (1, 10).

                           Evaluate the sine and combine like terms
10 = Asin  (1) + 2(1) + 5

            2 

10 = A + 7

A=3

A function of the form given fitting the data would be
              

 f (t) = 3sin  t  + 2t + 5
              2 

Alternative Approach

Notice we could have taken an alternate approach by plugging points (0, 5) and (2, 9)

into the original equation. Substituting (0, 5),

                           Evaluate the sine and simplify
5 = Asin  (0) + m(0) + b

          2 

5 =b

Substituting (2, 9)

                           Evaluate the sine and simplify
9 = Asin  (2) + m(2) + 5

          2 

9 = 2m + 5

4 = 2m

m = 2 , as we found above. Now we can proceed to find A the same way we did before.

Example 3
 The number of tourists visiting a ski and hiking resort
 averages 4000 people annually and oscillates
 seasonally, 1000 above and below the average. Due to
 a marketing campaign, the average number of tourists
 has been increasing by 200 each year. Write an
 equation for the number of tourists after t years,
 beginning at the peak season.

 Again there are two components to this problem: the
 oscillation and the average. For the oscillation, the
 number of tourists oscillates 1000 above and below average, giving an amplitude of
 1000. Since the oscillation is seasonal, it has a period of 1 year. Since we are given a
 starting point of "peak season", we will model this scenario with a cosine function.
 So far, this gives an equation in the form N (t) = 1000 cos(2 t) + midline .
                               Section 7.4 Modeling Changing Amplitude and Midline 491

The average is currently 4000, and is increasing by 200 each year. This is a constant
rate of change, so this is linear growth, average = 4000 + 200t . This function will act
as the midline.

Combining these two pieces gives a function for the number of tourists:
N (t) = 1000 cos(2 t) + 4000 + 200t

1. Given the function g(x) = (x2 -1) + 8cos(x) , describe the midline and amplitude

    using words.

Changing Amplitude

There are also situations in which the amplitude of a sinusoidal function does not stay
constant. Back in Chapter 6, we modeled the motion of a spring using a sinusoidal
function, but had to ignore friction in doing so. If there were friction in the system, we
would expect the amplitude of the oscillation to decrease over time. In the equation
 f (t) = Asin( Bt) + k , A gives the amplitude of the oscillation, we can allow the amplitude
to change by replacing this constant A with a function A(t).

Changing Amplitude
A function of the form f (t) = A(t) sin( Bt) + k will oscillate above and below the
midline with an amplitude given by A(t).

Here are some examples:  Exponential amplitude                 Quadratic amplitude
 Linear amplitude

f (t) = (mt + b) sin ( Bt ) + k f (t) = (abt ) sin ( Bt ) + k  f (t) = (at 2 ) sin ( Bt ) + k
492 Chapter 7

When thinking about a spring with amplitude decreasing
over time, it is tempting to use the simplest tool for the job
- a linear function. But if we attempt to model the
amplitude with a decreasing linear function, such as
A(t) = 10 - t , we quickly see the problem when we graph
the equation f (t) = (10 - t) sin( 4t) .

While the amplitude decreases at first as intended, the
amplitude hits zero at t = 10, then continues past the intercept, increasing in absolute
value, which is not the expected behavior. This behavior and function may model the
situation on a restricted domain and we might try to chalk
the rest of it up to model breakdown, but in fact springs
just don't behave like this.

A better model, as you will learn later in physics and
calculus, would show the amplitude decreasing by a fixed
percentage each second, leading to an exponential decay
model for the amplitude.

 Damped Harmonic Motion
 Damped harmonic motion, exhibited by springs subject to friction, follows a model
 of the form
  f (t) = abt sin( Bt) + k or f (t) = aert sin( Bt) + k .

Example 4
 A spring with natural length of 20 feet is pulled back 6 feet and released. It oscillates
 once every 2 seconds. Its amplitude decreases by 20% each second. Find a function
 that models the position of the spring t seconds after being released.

 Since the spring will oscillate on either side of the natural length, the midline will be at
 20 feet. The oscillation has a period of 2 seconds, and so the horizontal compression

 coefficient is B =  . Additionally, it begins at the furthest distance from the wall,

 indicating a cosine model.

 Meanwhile, the amplitude begins at 6 feet,
 and decreases by 20% each second, giving
 an amplitude function of A(t) = 6(1- 0.20)t .

 Combining this with the sinusoidal
 information gives a function for the position
 of the spring:
  f (t) = 6(0.80)t cos( t) + 20
              Section 7.4 Modeling Changing Amplitude and Midline 493

Example 5
 A spring with natural length of 30 cm is pulled out 10 cm and released. It oscillates 4
 times per second. After 2 seconds, the amplitude has decreased to 5 cm. Find a
 function that models the position of the spring.

 The oscillation has a period of 1 second, so B = 2 = 8 . Since the spring will
                                       4 14

 oscillate on either side of the natural length, the midline will be at 30 cm. It begins at
 the furthest distance from the wall, suggesting a cosine model. Together, this gives
  f (t) = A(t) cos(8 t) + 30 .

For the amplitude function, we notice that the amplitude starts at 10 cm, and decreases
to 5 cm after 2 seconds. This gives two points (0, 10) and (2, 5) that must be satisfied
by an exponential function: A(0) = 10 and A(2) = 5 . Since the function is exponential,

we can use the form A(t) = abt . Substituting the first point, 10 = ab0 , so a = 10.

Substituting in the second point,

5 = 10b 2     Divide by 10

1 = b2        Take the square root
2

b = 1  0.707
      2

This gives an amplitude function of A(t) = 10(0.707)t . Combining this with the

oscillation,
f (t) =10(0.707)t cos(8t) + 30

   a. Find a formula for the midline and the amplitude.
   b. Find a function S(t) that models the value of the stock after t years.

Example 6

 In AM (Amplitude Modulated) radio, a carrier wave with a high frequency is used to
 transmit music or other signals by applying the to-be-transmitted signal as the amplitude
 of the carrier signal. A musical note with frequency 110 Hz (Hertz = cycles per second)
 is to be carried on a wave with frequency of 2 KHz (KiloHertz = thousands of cycles
 per second). If the musical wave has an amplitude of 3, write a function describing the
 broadcast wave.
494 Chapter 7

 The carrier wave, with a frequency of 2000 cycles per second, would have period 1
                                                                                                     2000

 of a second, giving an equation of the form sin(4000 t) . Our choice of a sine function
 here was arbitrary - it would have worked just was well to use a cosine.
 The musical tone, with a frequency of 110 cycles per second, would have a period of

   1 of a second. With an amplitude of 3, this would correspond to a function of the
  110
 form 3sin(220 t) . Again our choice of using a sine function is arbitrary.
 The musical wave is acting as the amplitude of the carrier wave, so we will multiply the
 musical tone's function by the carrier wave function, resulting in the function
  f (t) = 3sin(220 t) sin(4000 t)

Applications of

Trigonometry

In this chapter, we will explore additional applications of trigonometry. We will begin
with an extension of the right triangle trigonometry we explored in Chapter 5 to situations
involving non-right triangles. We will explore the polar coordinate system and
parametric equations as new ways of describing curves in the plane. In the process, we
will introduce vectors and an alternative way of writing complex numbers, two important
mathematical tools we use when analyzing and modeling the world around us.

Section 8.1 Non-Right Triangles: Laws of Sines and Cosines

Although right triangles allow us to solve many applications, it is more common to find
scenarios where the triangle we are interested in does not have a right angle.

Two radar stations located 20 miles apart   15            35
both detect a UFO located between them.
The angle of elevation measured by the           20 miles
first station is 35 degrees. The angle of
elevation measured by the second station
is 15 degrees. What is the altitude of the
UFO?

We see that the triangle formed by the UFO and the two stations is not a right triangle.
Of course, in any triangle we could draw an altitude, a perpendicular line from one
vertex to the opposite side, forming two right triangles, but it would be nice to have
methods for working directly with non-right triangles. In this section, we will expand
upon the right triangle trigonometry we learned in Chapter 5, and adapt it to non-right
triangles.

Law of Sines

Given an arbitrary non-right triangle, we can drop an altitude, which we temporarily label
h, to create two right triangles.

Using the right triangle relationships,                            

sin( ) = h and sin(  ) = h .                                    b             a
      b                     a
                                                                   h

Solving both equations for h, we get b sin( ) = h and                                

a sin(  ) = h . Since the h is the same in both equations,              c

we establish b sin( ) = a sin(  ) . Dividing both sides by

ab, we conclude that

sin( ) = sin(  )
a        b

Had we drawn the altitude to be perpendicular to side b or a, we could similarly establish

sin( ) = sin(  ) and sin(  ) = sin(  )
a        c               b     c

Collectively, these relationships are called the Law of Sines.

Law of Sines

Given a triangle with angles and sides opposite labeled as shown, the ratio of sine of
angle to length of the opposite side will always be equal, or, symbolically,

sin( ) = sin(  ) = sin(  )                                              
   a          b       c
                                                                                 a
                                                                   b

For clarity, we call side a the corresponding side of angle .                        
Similarly, we call angle , the corresponding angle of side a.
Likewise for side b and angle , and for side c and angle .                 c

When we use the law of sines, we use any pair of ratios as an equation. In the most
straightforward case, we know two angles and one of the corresponding sides.
                       Section 8.1 Non-Right Triangles: Laws of Sines and Cosines 499

Example 1                                               b  10
 In the triangle shown here, solve for the
 unknown sides and angle.                               50               30

 Solving for the unknown angle is relatively                       c
 easy, since the three angles must add to 180
 degrees.

From this, we can determine that
 = 180 - 50 - 30 = 100.

To find an unknown side, we need to know the corresponding angle, and we also need
another known ratio.

Since we know the angle 50 and its corresponding side, we can use this for one of the
two ratios. To look for side b, we would use its corresponding angle, 30.

sin( 50) = sin( 30)               Multiply both sides by b
10  b                             Divide, or multiply by the reciprocal, to solve for b

b sin( 50) = sin( 30)
     10

b = sin( 30) 10  6.527
               sin( 50)

Similarly, to solve for side c, we set up the equation

sin( 50) = sin(100)
10  c

c = sin(100) 10  12.856
                sin( 50)

Example 2
 Find the elevation of the UFO from the beginning of the section.

To find the elevation of the UFO, we first                   a
find the distance from one station to the
UFO, such as the side a in the picture,                 15           h   35
then use right triangle relationships to
find the height of the UFO, h.                                  20 miles

Since the angles in the triangle add to 180 degrees, the unknown angle of the triangle
must be 180 - 15 - 35 = 130. This angle is opposite the side of length 20, allowing
us to set up a Law of Sines relationship:
500 Chapter 8

sin(130) = sin( 35)            Multiply by a
20                a            Divide, or multiply by the reciprocal, to solve for a
                               Simplify
a sin(130) = sin( 35)
      20

a = 20 sin( 35)  14.975
      sin(130 )

The distance from one station to the UFO is about 15 miles. Now that we know a, we

can use right triangle relationships to solve for h.

sin(15) = opposite = h = h                            Solve for h
             hypotenuse a 14.975

h = 14.975 sin(15)  3.876

The UFO is at an altitude of 3.876 miles.

In addition to solving triangles in which two angles are known, the law of sines can be
used to solve for an angle when two sides and one corresponding angle are known.

Example 3                                                             12        
 In the triangle shown here, solve for the unknown sides and
 angles.

In choosing which pair of ratios from the Law of Sines to          

use, we always want to pick a pair where we know three of                         a

the four pieces of information in the equation. In this case,      9      85
we know the angle 85 and its corresponding side, so we

will use that ratio. Since our only other known information

is the side with length 9, we will use that side and solve for its corresponding angle.

sin(85) = sin(  )              Isolate the unknown
12             9               Use the inverse sine to find a first solution

9sin( 85) = sin(  )
    12

Remember when we use the inverse function that there are two possible answers.

    -1 9sin( 85) 
 = sin                 48.3438  By symmetry we find the second possible solution
     12 

 = 180 - 48.3438  = 131.6562 
                   Section 8.1 Non-Right Triangles: Laws of Sines and Cosines 501

In this second case, if   132, then  would be  = 180 - 85 - 132 = -37, which
doesn't make sense, so the only possibility for this triangle is  = 48.3438.
With a second angle, we can now easily find the third angle, since the angles must add
to 180, so  = 180 - 85 - 48.3438 = 46.6562.

Now that we know , we can proceed as in earlier examples to find the unknown side a.

sin( 85) = sin( 46.6562 )
12      a

a = 12 sin( 46.6562 )  8.7603
          sin( 85)

Notice that in the problem above, when we use Law of Sines to solve for an unknown
angle, there can be two possible solutions. This is called the ambiguous case, and can
arise when we know two sides and a non-included angle. In the ambiguous case we may
find that a particular set of given information can lead to 2, 1 or no solution at all.
However, when an accurate picture of the triangle or suitable context is available, we can
determine which angle is desired.

    angles. If there is more than one possible solution, show both.

Example 4
 Find all possible triangles if one side has length 4 opposite an angle of 50 and a second
 side has length 10.

Using the given information, we can look for the angle opposite the side of length 10.

sin( 50) = sin( )
4   10

sin( ) = 10 sin( 50)  1.915
                4

Since the range of the sine function is [-1, 1], it is impossible for the sine value to be
1.915. There are no triangles that can be drawn with the provided dimensions.
502 Chapter 8

Example 5
 Find all possible triangles if one side has length 6 opposite an angle of 50 and a second
 side has length 4.

Using the given information, we can look for the angle opposite the side of length 4.

sin( 50) = sin( )
6              4

sin( ) = 4sin( 50)  0.511  Use the inverse to find one solution
               6

 = sin -1(0.511)  30.710   By symmetry there is a second possible solution

 = 180 - 30.710 = 149.290

If we use the angle 30.710 , the third angle would be 180 - 50 - 30.710 = 99.290.

We can then use Law of Sines again to find the third side.

sin( 50) = sin( 99.290)    Solve for c
6                 c

c = 7.730

If we used the angle  = 149.290, the third angle would be 180 - 50 - 149.290 =
-19.29, which is impossible, so the previous triangle is the only possible one.

Try it Now
2. Given  = 80, a = 100, and b = 10 find the missing side and angles. If there is more

Law of Cosines

Suppose a boat leaves port, travels 10 miles, turns 20 degrees, and travels     8 mi
another 8 miles. How far from port is the boat?                                       20

Unfortunately, while the Law of Sines lets us address many non-right               10 mi
triangle cases, it does not allow us to address triangles where the one
known angle is included between two known sides, which means it is not       
a corresponding angle for a known side. For this, we need another tool.

Given an arbitrary non-right triangle, we can                       a
drop an altitude, which we temporarily label   c               b - x
h, to create two right triangles. We will                   b
divide the base b into two pieces, one of               h
which we will temporarily label x.
                                               
                                                 x
                      Section 8.1 Non-Right Triangles: Laws of Sines and Cosines 503

From this picture, we can establish the right triangle relationship

cos( ) = x , or equivalently, x = ccos( )

            c

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can establish

(b - x)2 + h2 = a 2 and x 2 + h2 = c 2

Both of these equations can be solved for h 2

h2 = a 2 - (b - x)2 and h2 = c 2 - x 2

Since the left side of each equation is h 2 , the right sides must be equal

c2 - x2 = a 2 - (b - x)2                       Multiply out the right
                                               Simplify
c2 - x2 = a2 - (b2 - 2bx + x2 )

c 2 - x 2 = a 2 - b2 + 2bx - x 2

c2 = a 2 - b2 + 2bx                            Isolate a 2

a 2 = c 2 + b2 - 2bx                           Substitute in c cos( ) = x from above

a2 = c2 + b2 - 2bccos()

This result is called the Law of Cosines. Depending upon which side we dropped the
altitude down from, we could have established this relationship using any of the angles.
The important thing to note is that the right side of the equation involves an angle and the
sides adjacent to that angle - the left side of the equation involves the side opposite that
angle.

Law of Cosines                                                                    
Given a triangle with angles and opposite sides labeled as shown,
                                                                             b         a
a2 = c2 + b2 - 2bccos()
b2 = a2 + c2 - 2accos( )                                                                  
c2 = a2 + b2 - 2abcos( )
                                                                                    c

Notice that if one of the angles of the triangle is 90 degrees, cos(90) = 0, so the formula

c2 = a2 + b2 - 2abcos(90)         Simplifies to

c2 = a2 + b2

You should recognize this as the Pythagorean Theorem. Indeed, the Law of Cosines is
sometimes called the Generalized Pythagorean Theorem, since it extends the
Pythagorean Theorem to non-right triangles.
504 Chapter 8

Example 6                                                                    8 mi
 Returning to our question from earlier, suppose a boat leaves port,              20
 travels 10 miles, turns 20 degrees, and travels another 8 miles. How far
 from port is the boat?                                                         10 mi

The boat turned 20 degrees, so the obtuse angle of the non-right triangle
shown in the picture is the supplemental angle, 180 - 20 = 160.

With this, we can utilize the Law of Cosines to find the missing side of
the obtuse triangle - the distance from the boat to port.

x2 = 82 +102 - 2(8)(10) cos(160)           Evaluate the cosine and simplify
x2 = 314.3508                              Square root both sides
x = 314.3508 = 17.730

The boat is 17.73 miles from port.

Example 7                                                   10
 Find the unknown side and angles of this  x 
 triangle.                                                      30
                                                    12
 Notice that we don't have both pieces of
 any side/angle pair, so the Law of Sines
 would not work with this triangle.

Since we have the angle included between the two known sides, we can turn to Law of
Cosines.

Since the left side of any of the Law of Cosines equations involves the side opposite the
known angle, the left side in this situation will involve the side x. The other two sides
can be used in either order.

x2 = 102 +122 - 2(10)(12) cos(30)          Evaluate the cosine
x2 = 10 2 + 12 2 - 2(10)(12) 3             Simplify
                                           Take the square root
                                2
x2 = 244 -120 3

x = 244 -120 3  6.013

Now that we know an angle and its corresponding side, we can use the Law of Sines to
fill in the remaining angles of the triangle. Solving for angle ,
                      Section 8.1 Non-Right Triangles: Laws of Sines and Cosines 505

sin( 30) = sin( )
 6.013 10

sin( ) = 10 sin( 30)                          Use the inverse sine
             6.013

-110 sin( 30) 
 = sin                  56.256
 6.013 

The other possibility for  would be  = 180 - 56.256 = 123.744. In the original
picture,  is an acute angle, so 123.744 doesn't make sense if we assume the picture is
drawn to scale.

Proceeding with  = 56.256, we can then find the third angle of the triangle:
 = 180 - 30 - 56.256 = 93.744 .

In addition to solving for the missing side opposite one known angle, the Law of Cosines
allows us to find the angles of a triangle when we know all three sides.

Example 8
 Solve for the angle  in the triangle shown.

Using the Law of Cosines,                     Simplify                   25

202 = 182 + 252 - 2(18)(25) cos()                                    20
                                                                     18
400 = 949 - 900 cos( )

- 549 = -900 cos( )

- 549 = cos( )
- 900

-1 - 549 
 = cos            52.410
 - 900 

Try it Now
3. Given  = 25,b = 10, and c = 20 find the missing side and angles.

Notice that since the inverse cosine can return any angle between 0 and 180 degrees,
there will not be any ambiguous cases when using Law of Cosines to find an angle.
506 Chapter 8

Example 9

 On many cell phones with GPS, an approximate location can be given before the GPS
 signal is received. This is done by a process called triangulation, which works by using
 the distance from two known points. Suppose there are two cell phone towers within
 range of you, located 6000 feet apart along a straight highway that runs east to west, and
 you know you are north of the highway. Based on the signal delay, it can be
 determined you are 5050 feet from the first tower, and 2420 feet from the second.
 Determine your position north and east of the first tower, and determine how far you are
 from the highway.

For simplicity, we start by drawing a picture and  5050 ft              2420 ft
labeling our given information. Using the Law
of Cosines, we can solve for the angle .            
                                                         6000 ft
2420 2 = 6000 2 + 5050 2 - 2(5050 )(6000 ) cos( )
5856400 = 61501500 - 60600000 cos( )
- 554646100 = -60600000 cos( )
cos( ) = - 554646100 = 0.9183

            - 60600000
 = cos-1(0.9183) = 23.328

Using this angle, we could then use right          5050 ft
triangles to find the position of the cell phone                     y
relative to the western tower.
                                                    23.3
cos(23.328) = x                                          x
                   5050

x = 5050 cos(23.328)  4637 .2 feet
sin( 23.328) = y

                  5050
y = 5050 sin( 23.328)  1999 .8 feet

You are 5050 ft from the tower and 23.328 north of east (or, equivalently, 66.672 east
of north). Specifically, you are about 4637 feet east and 2000 feet north of the first
tower.

Note that if you didn't know whether you were north or south of the towers, our
calculations would have given two possible locations, one north of the highway and one
south. To resolve this ambiguity in real world situations, locating a position using
triangulation requires a signal from a third tower.

Example 10
 To measure the height of a hill, a woman measures the angle of elevation to the top of
 the hill to be 24 degrees. She then moves back 200 feet and measures the angle of
 elevation to be 22 degrees. Find the height of the hill.

 As with many problems of this nature, it will be helpful to draw a picture.

     22                24

200 ft

Notice there are three triangles formed here - the right triangle including the height h
and the 22 degree angle, the right triangle including the height h and the 24 degree
angle, and the (non-right) obtuse triangle including the 200 ft side. Since this is the
triangle we have the most information for, we will begin with it. It may seem odd to
work with this triangle since it does not include the desired side h, but we don't have
enough information to work with either of the right triangles yet.

We can find the obtuse angle of the triangle, since it and the angle of 24 degrees
complete a straight line - a 180 degree angle. The obtuse angle must be 180 - 24 =
156. From this, we can determine that the third angle is 2. We know one side is 200
feet, and its corresponding angle is 2, so by introducing a temporary variable x for one
of the other sides (as shown below), we can use Law of Sines to solve for this length x.

                                    2

22                          x  h

          156 24

200 ft

    x = 200                     Setting up the Law of Sines
sin( 22) sin( 2)                isolating the x value
x = sin( 22) 200

               sin( 2)
x = 2146.77 ft

Now that we know x, we can use right triangle properties to solve for h.
sin( 24) = opposite = h = h

             hypotenuse x 2146 .77

h = 2146 .77 sin( 24) = 873.17 ft. The hill is 873 feet high.

Section 8.2 Polar Coordinates

The coordinate system we are most familiar with is called the Cartesian coordinate
system, a rectangular plane divided into four quadrants by horizontal and vertical axes.

In earlier chapters, we often found the Cartesian coordinates of a
point on a circle at a given angle from the positive horizontal axis.
Sometimes that angle, along with the point's distance from the
origin, provides a more useful way of describing the point's
location than conventional Cartesian coordinates.

 Polar Coordinates
 Polar coordinates of a point consist of an ordered pair, (r, ) , where r is the distance
 from the point to the origin, and  is the angle measured in standard position.

Notice that if we were to "grid" the plane for polar coordinates, it
would look like the graph to the right, with circles at incremental
radii, and rays drawn at incremental angles.

Example 1
                         5 

 Plot the polar point 3,  .
                           6

 This point will be a distance of 3 from the origin, at an angle of
  5

      . Plotting this,

 Plot the polar point  - 2,  .
                           4

 Typically we use positive r values, but occasionally we run into
 cases where r is negative. On a regular number line, we measure
 positive values to the right and negative values to the left. We

                                                                         
 will plot this point similarly. To start, we rotate to an angle of .

                                                                            4
 Moving this direction, into the first quadrant, would be positive r
 values. For negative r values, we move the opposite direction,
 into the third quadrant. Plotting this:

Note the resulting point is the same as the polar point  2,  . In fact, any Cartesian

                                                                  4
point can be represented by an infinite number of different polar coordinates by adding or
subtracting full rotations to these points. For example, same point could also be

                  13 
represented as  2,  .

Converting Points

To convert between polar coordinates and Cartesian coordinates, we recall the
relationships we developed back in Chapter 5.

Converting Between Polar and Cartesian Coordinates

To convert between polar (r, ) and Cartesian (x, y) coordinates,

we use the relationships                                                       (x, y)

cos( ) = x   x = r cos( )                                                r
          r                                                                    y

sin( ) = y   y = r sin( )                                                 
          r                                                               x

tan( ) = y   x2 + y2 = r2
          x

From these relationship and our knowledge of the unit circle, if r = 1 and  =  , the
                                                                                            3

                                         
polar coordinates would be (r, ) = 1,  , and the corresponding Cartesian coordinates

We begin by finding the distance r using the Pythagorean relationship x2 + y2 = r 2
(-3)2 + (-4)2 = r 2
9 +16 = r2
r 2 = 25
r =5

Now that we know the radius, we can find the angle using any of the three trig

relationships. Keep in mind that any of the relationships will produce two solutions on

the circle, and we need to consider the quadrant to determine which solution to accept.

Using the cosine, for example:

cos( ) = x = - 3
           r5

         -1 - 3                      By symmetry, there is a second possibility at
 = cos    2.214

           5

 = 2 - 2.214 = 4.069

Since the point (-3, -4) is located in the 3rd quadrant, we can determine that the second
angle is the one we need. The polar coordinates of this point are (r, ) = (5,4.069) .

Polar Equations

Just as a Cartesian equation like y = x2 describes a relationship between x and y values
on a Cartesian grid, a polar equation can be written describing a relationship between r
and  values on the polar grid.

Example 5

 Sketch a graph of the polar equation r =  .

The equation r =  describes all the points for which the radius r is equal to the angle.

To visualize this relationship, we can create a table of values.

 0   /4 /2 3/4  5/4 3/2 7/4 2

r 0  /4 /2 3/4  5/4 3/2 7/4 2

We can plot these points on the plane, and then sketch a
curve that fits the points. The resulting graph is a spiral.

Notice that the resulting graph cannot be the result of a
function of the form y = f(x), as it does not pass the vertical
line test, even though it resulted from a function giving r in
terms of .

Although it is nice to see polar equations on polar grids, it
is more common for polar graphs to be graphed on the
Cartesian coordinate system, and so, the remainder of the
polar equations will be graphed accordingly.

The spiral graph above on a Cartesian grid is shown here.

Example 6
 Sketch a graph of the polar equation r = 3 .

 Recall that when a variable does not show up in the
 equation, it is saying that it does not matter what value that
 variable has; the output for the equation will remain the
 same. For example, the Cartesian equation y = 3 describes
 all the points where y = 3, no matter what the x values are,
 producing a horizontal line. Likewise, this polar equation is
 describing all the points at a distance of 3 from the origin, no
 matter what the angle is, producing the graph of a circle.
518 Chapter 8

The normal settings on graphing calculators and software graph on the Cartesian
coordinate system with y being a function of x, where the graphing utility asks for f(x), or
simply y =.

To graph polar equations, you may need to change the mode of your calculator to Polar.
You will know you have been successful in changing the mode if you now have r as a
function of , where the graphing utility asks for r(), or simply r =.

Example 7
 Sketch a graph of the polar equation r = 4cos( ) , and find an
 interval on which it completes one cycle.

While we could again create a table, plot the corresponding
points, and connect the dots, we can also turn to technology to
directly graph it. Using technology, we produce the graph
shown here, a circle passing through the origin.

Since this graph appears to close a loop and repeat itself, we might ask what interval of
 values yields the entire graph. At  = 0, r = 4cos(0) = 4 , yielding the point (4, 0). We

want the next  value when the graph returns to the point (4, 0). Solving for when x = 4
is equivalent to solving r cos( ) = 4 .

r cos( ) = 4               Substituting the equation for r gives
4cos( )cos( ) = 4          Dividing by 4 and simplifying

cos2 ( ) =1                This has solutions when
cos( ) = 1 or cos( ) = -1  Solving these gives solutions
 = 0 or  = 

This shows us at 0 radians we are at the point (0, 4), and again at radians we are at the
point (0, 4) having finished one complete revolution.

The interval 0   yields one complete iteration of the circle.

3. Sketch a graph of the polar equation r = 3sin( ) , and find an interval on which it

The last few examples have all been circles. Next, we will consider two other "named"
polar equations, limaons and roses.

Example 8
 Sketch a graph of the polar equation r = 4sin( ) + 2 . What interval of  values
 corresponds to the inner loop?

This type of graph is called a limaon.
Using technology, we can draw the graph. The inner loop
begins and ends at the origin, where r = 0. We can solve for
the  values for which r = 0.

0 = 4sin( ) + 2

- 2 = 4sin( )

sin( ) = - 1
            2

 = 7 or  = 11
6                 6

This tells us that r = 0, so the graph passes through the

origin, twice on the interval [0, 2).

The inner loop arises from the interval 7    11 .
                                       6     6

This corresponds to where the function r = 4sin( ) + 2

takes on negative values, as we could see if we graphed

the function in the r plane.

Example 9
 Sketch a graph of the polar equation r = cos(3 ) . What interval
 of  values describes one small loop of the graph?

This type of graph is called a 3 leaf rose.

We can use technology to produce a graph. The interval [0, )
yields one cycle of this function. As with the last problem, we
can note that there is an interval on which one loop of this graph
begins and ends at the origin, where r = 0. Solving for ,

0 = cos(3 )                            Substitute u = 3

0 = cos(u)

u =  or u = 3        or u = 5

     6                       2                   6

There are 3 solutions on 0     which correspond to the 3 times the graph returns to

the origin, but the first two solutions we solved for above are enough to conclude that

one loop corresponds to the interval      .
                                  6   2

If we wanted to get an idea of how the computer drew this graph, consider when  = 0.

r = cos(3 ) = cos(0) = 1, so the graph starts at (1,0). As we found above, at  =  and
                                                                                              6

Converting Equations

While many polar equations cannot be expressed nicely in Cartesian form (and vice
versa), it can be beneficial to convert between the two forms, when possible. To do this
we use the same relationships we used to convert points between coordinate systems.
                                  Section 8.2 Polar Coordinates 521

Example 10
 Rewrite the Cartesian equation x2 + y2 = 6y as a polar equation.

We wish to eliminate x and y from the equation and introduce r and . Ideally, we
would like to write the equation with r isolated, if possible, which represents r as a
function of .

x2 + y2 = 6y              Remembering x2 + y2 = r 2 we substitute

r2 = 6y                   y = r sin( ) and so we substitute again

r 2 = 6r sin( )           Subtract 6r sin( ) from both sides

r 2 - 6r sin( ) = 0       Factor

r(r - 6sin()) = 0         Use the zero factor theorem

r = 6sin( ) or r = 0      Since r = 0 is only a point, we reject that solution.

The solution r = 6sin( ) is fairly similar to the one we graphed in Example 7. In fact,
this equation describes a circle with bottom at the origin and top at the point (0, 6).

Example 11
 Rewrite the Cartesian equation y = 3x + 2 as a polar equation.

y = 3x + 2                Use y = r sin( ) and x = r cos( )
r sin( ) = 3r cos( ) + 2  Move all terms with r to one side
r sin( ) - 3r cos( ) = 2  Factor out r
                          Divide
r(sin() - 3cos()) = 2

r= 2
    sin( ) - 3cos( )

In this case, the polar equation is more unwieldy than the Cartesian equation, but there
are still times when this equation might be useful.

Example 12
 Rewrite the polar equation r = 3 as a Cartesian equation.
                                     1- 2cos( )

 We want to eliminate  and r and introduce x and y. It is usually easiest to start by
 clearing the fraction and looking to substitute values that will eliminate .
522 Chapter 8

r= 3                     Clear the fraction
    1- 2cos( )
                         Use cos( ) = x to eliminate 
r(1- 2cos()) = 3                         r

  x                      Distribute and simplify
r1 - 2  = 3
  r                      Isolate the r
r - 2x = 3               Square both sides
r = 3+ 2x                Use x2 + y2 = r 2

r 2 = (3 + 2x)2
x2 + y 2 = (3 + 2x)2

When our entire equation has been changed from r and  to x and y we can stop unless
asked to solve for y or simplify.

In this example, if desired, the right side of the equation could be expanded and the
equation simplified further. However, the equation cannot be written as a function in
Cartesian form.

Section 8.3 Polar Form of Complex Numbers

From previous classes, you may have encountered "imaginary numbers" - the square
roots of negative numbers - and, more generally, complex numbers which are the sum of
a real number and an imaginary number. While these are useful for expressing the
solutions to quadratic equations, they have much richer applications in electrical
engineering, signal analysis, and other fields. Most of these more advanced applications
rely on properties that arise from looking at complex numbers from the perspective of
polar coordinates.

We will begin with a review of the definition of complex numbers.

Imaginary Number i

The most basic complex number is i, defined to be i = -1 , commonly called an
imaginary number. Any real multiple of i is also an imaginary number.

Example 1
 Simplify - 9 .

We can separate - 9 as   9 -1 . We can take the square root of 9, and write the
square root of -1 as i.

  - 9 = 9 -1 = 3i

A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number.

Complex Number
A complex number is a number z = a + bi , where a and b are real numbers
a is the real part of the complex number
b is the imaginary part of the complex number

i = -1

Plotting a complex number
We can plot real numbers on a number line. For example, if we wanted to show the
number 3, we plot a point:
528 Chapter 8                                             imaginary
                                                                     real
To plot a complex number like 3 - 4i , we need more than
just a number line since there are two components to the
number. To plot this number, we need two number lines,
crossed to form a complex plane.

 Complex Plane
 In the complex plane, the horizontal axis is the real axis and the vertical axis is the
 imaginary axis.

Example 2
 Plot the number 3 - 4i on the complex plane.

 The real part of this number is 3, and the imaginary part is -
 4. To plot this, we draw a point 3 units to the right of the
 origin in the horizontal direction and 4 units down in the
 vertical direction.

 Because this is analogous to the Cartesian coordinate system
 for plotting points, we can think about plotting our complex
 number z = a + bi as if we were plotting the point (a, b) in
 Cartesian coordinates. Sometimes people write complex
 numbers as z = x + yi to highlight this relation.

Arithmetic on Complex Numbers

Before we dive into the more complicated uses of complex numbers, let's make sure we
remember the basic arithmetic involved. To add or subtract complex numbers, we simply
add the like terms, combining the real parts and combining the imaginary parts.

Example 3
 Add 3 - 4i and 2 + 5i .

 Adding (3 - 4i) + (2 + 5i) , we add the real parts and the imaginary parts
  3 + 2 - 4i + 5i
  5+i

Try it Now
1. Subtract 2 + 5i from 3 - 4i .
                                              Section 8.3 Polar Form of Complex Numbers 529
We can also multiply and divide complex numbers.

Example 4
 Multiply: 4(2 + 5i) .

To multiply the complex number by a real number, we simply distribute as we would
when multiplying polynomials.

4(2 + 5i)                      Distribute
= 4  2 + 4  5i                 Simplify
= 8 + 20i

Example 5
 Multiply: (2 - 3i)(1 + 4i) .

To multiply two complex numbers, we expand the product as we would with

polynomials (the process commonly called FOIL - "first outer inner last").

(2 - 3i)(1 + 4i)               Expand

= 2 + 8i - 3i - 12i 2          Since i = -1 , i 2 = -1
= 2 + 8i - 3i - 12(-1)         Simplify

=14 + 5i

Example 6
 Divide (2 + 5i) .
            (4 - i)

 To divide two complex numbers, we have to devise a way to write this as a complex
 number with a real part and an imaginary part.

 We start this process by eliminating the complex number in the denominator. To do
 this, we multiply the numerator and denominator by a special complex number so that
 the result in the denominator is a real number. The number we need to multiply by is
 called the complex conjugate, in which the sign of the imaginary part is changed.
 Here, 4+i is the complex conjugate of 4-i. Of course, obeying our algebraic rules, we
 must multiply by 4+i on both the top and bottom.
  (2 + 5i)  (4 + i)
   (4 - i) (4 + i)

 In the numerator,
530 Chapter 8

(2 + 5i)(4 + i)                       Expand     -1 , i 2 = -1
= 8 + 20i + 2i + 5i2
= 8 + 20i + 2i + 5(-1)                Since i =
= 3+ 22i                              Simplify

Multiplying the denominator           Expand
(4 - i)(4 + i)                        Since i = -1 , i 2 = -1

(16 - 4i + 4i - i2 )
(16 - (-1))
=17

Combining this we get 3 + 22i = 3 + 22i
                              17 17 17

2. Multiply 3 - 4i and 2 + 3i .

With the interpretation of complex numbers as points in a plane, which can be related to
the Cartesian coordinate system, you might be starting to guess our next step - to refer to
this point not by its horizontal and vertical components, but using its polar location, given
by the distance from the origin and an angle.

Polar Form of Complex Numbers

Remember, because the complex plane is analogous to the Cartesian plane that we can
think of a complex number z = x + yi as analogous to the Cartesian point (x, y) and recall

how we converted from (x, y) to polar (r, ) coordinates in the last section.

Bringing in all of our old rules we remember the following:

                                                                imaginary

cos( ) = x              x = r cos( )                                       x + yi
           r            y = r sin( )
                        x2 + y2 = r2                                 r
sin( ) = y                                                                 y
          r
                                                                                   real
tan( ) = y
          x                                                          x

With this in mind, we can write z = x + yi = r cos( ) + ir sin( ) .
   Section 8.3 Polar Form of Complex Numbers 531

Example 7
 Express the complex number 4i using polar coordinates.

On the complex plane, the number 4i is a distance of 4 from

                                                       
the origin at an angle of , so 4i = 4 cos  + i4sin  
2  2                                                  2

Note that the real part of this complex number is 0.

In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler demonstrated a relationship between exponential and
trigonometric functions that allows the use of complex numbers to greatly simplify some
trigonometric calculations. While the proof is beyond the scope of this class, you will
likely see it in a later calculus class.

Polar Form of a Complex Number and Euler's Formula
The polar form of a complex number is z = r cos( ) + ir sin( ) .
An alternate form, which will be the primary one used, is z = rei

Euler's Formula states rei = r cos( ) + ir sin( )

Similar to plotting a point in the polar coordinate system we need r and  to find the

polar form of a complex number.

Example 8
 Find the polar form of the complex number -8.

 Treating this is a complex number, we can write it as -8+0i.

 Plotted in the complex plane, the number -8 is on the negative
 horizontal axis, a distance of 8 from the origin at an angle of 
 from the positive horizontal axis.

 The polar form of the number -8 is 8ei .

 Plugging r = 8 and  =  back into Euler's formula, we have:

 8ei = 8cos( ) + 8i sin( ) = -8 + 0i = -8 as desired.
532 Chapter 8

Example 9
 Find the polar form of - 4 + 4i .

 On the complex plane, this complex number would correspond to the point (-4, 4) on a
 Cartesian plane. We can find the distance r and angle  as we did in the last section.

  r2 = x2 + y2
  r 2 = (-4)2 + 42
  r = 32 = 4 2

 To find , we can use cos( ) = x
                                       r

  cos( ) = - 4 = - 2
             42 2

 This is one of known cosine values, and since the point is
 in the second quadrant, we can conclude that  = 3 .

 The polar form of this complex number is 4 2e 4 .

Example 10
 Find the polar form of - 3 - 5i .

 On the complex plane, this complex number would correspond to the point (-3, -5) on a
 Cartesian plane. First, we find r.
  r2 = x2 + y2
  r 2 = (-3)2 + (-5)2
  r = 34

 To find , we might use tan( ) = y
                                          x

  tan( ) = - 5
            -3

           -1  5 
  = tan   = 1.0304

             3

 This angle is in the wrong quadrant, so we need to find a second solution. For tangent,
 we can find that by adding .

  =1.0304 + = 4.1720

 The polar form of this complex number is 34e4.1720i .

The polar form of a complex number provides a powerful way to compute powers and
roots of complex numbers by using exponent rules you learned in algebra. To compute a
power of a complex number, we:

    1) Convert to polar form
    2) Raise to the power, using exponent rules to simplify
    3) Convert back to a + bi form, if needed

Example 12

 Evaluate (- 4 + 4i)6 .

While we could multiply this number by itself five times, that would be very tedious.
To compute this more efficiently, we can utilize the polar form of the complex number.

                                                                                                        3 i

In an earlier example, we found that - 4 + 4i = 4 2e 4 . Using this,

(- 4 + 4i)6                 Write the complex number in polar form
                            Utilize the exponent rule (ab)m = ambm

                  9 i

= 32768 e 2

At this point, we have found the power as a complex number in polar form. If we want
the answer in standard a + bi form, we can utilize Euler's formula.

   2              2

We have found that (- 4 + 4i)6 = 32768 i .

The result of the process can be summarized by DeMoivre's Theorem. This is a
shorthand to using exponent rules.

DeMoivre's Theorem

If z = r (cos ( ) + i sin ( )) , then for any integer n, zn = rn (cos (n ) + i sin (n ))

We omit the proof, but note we can easily verify it holds in one case using Example 12:

                  6   3              3                9   9 
6(-4 + 4i) = (4 2) cos6   + i sin6   = 32768 cos  + i sin  = 32768 i

Example 13
 Evaluate 9i .

To evaluate the square root of a complex number, we can first note that the square root

                                            1  9i = (9i)1/ 2 .
is the same as having an exponent of :

                                            2

To evaluate the power, we first write the complex number in polar form. Since 9i has
no real part, we know that this value would be plotted along the vertical axis, a distance

                                        i
of 9 from the origin at an angle of . This gives the polar form: 9i = 9e 2 .

                                         2

Then, to evaluate the square root,

9i = (9i)1/ 2                  Use the polar form

Using the polar form, we were able to find a square root of a complex number.

Alternatively, using DeMoivre's Theorem we could write

4. Evaluate ( 3 + i) using polar form.

You may remember that equations like x 2 = 4 have two solutions, 2 and -2 in this case,

though the square root 4 only gives one of those solutions. Likewise, the square root

we found in Example 11 is only one of two complex numbers whose square is 9i.
Similarly, the equation z3 = 8 would have three solutions where only one is given by the
cube root. In this case, however, only one of those solutions, z = 2, is a real value. To
find the others, we can use the fact that complex numbers have multiple representations
in polar form.
536 Chapter 8

Example 14
 Find all complex solutions to z3 = 8 .

Since we are trying to solve   z3   = 8, we can solve for z as           1/ 3  Certainly one of

                                                                z=8 .

these solutions is the basic cube root, giving z = 2. To find others, we can turn to the

polar representation of 8.

Since 8 is a real number, is would sit in the complex plane on the horizontal axis at an

angle of 0, giving the polar form 8e0i . Taking the 1/3 power of this gives the real

solution:

(8e ) = 8 (e ) = 2e = 2cos(0) + i2sin( 0) = 2
0i 1/ 3    1/ 3 0i 1/ 3     0

However, since the angle 2 is coterminal with the angle of 0, we could also represent
the number 8 as 8e2i . Taking the 1/3 power of this gives a first complex solution:

                               2          2        2   1   3 
(8e ) = 8 (e ) = 2e              i
2i 1/ 3    1/ 3 2i 1/ 3        3    = 2 cos   + i2sin    = 2 -  + i2             =  -1  +        3i
                                                                               
                                         3         3   2  2 

For the third root, we use the angle of 4, which is also coterminal with an angle of 0.

4pi 1/3 1/3 4pi 1/3 4p3 i            4p          4p   1   3 
(8e ) = 8 (e ) = 2e = 2cos + i2sin  = 2- + i2-  = -1- 3i
                                    3            3   2  2 

Altogether, we found all three complex solutions to z3 = 8 ,

z = 2, -1+ 3i, -1- 3i

Graphed, these three numbers would be equally spaced on a
circle about the origin at a radius of 2.

Section 8.4 Vectors

A woman leaves home, walks 3 miles north, then 2 miles southeast. How far is she from
home, and in which direction would she need to walk to return home? How far has she
walked by the time she gets home?
This question may seem familiar - indeed we did a similar problem with a boat in the
first section of this chapter. In that section, we solved the problem using triangles. In
this section, we will investigate another way to approach the problem using vectors, a
geometric entity that indicates both a distance and a direction. We will begin our
investigation using a purely geometric view of vectors.
A Geometric View of Vectors

 Vector
 A vector is an object that has both a length and a direction.

 Geometrically, a vector can be represented by an arrow that has a fixed length and
 indicates a direction. If, starting at the point A, a vector, which means "carrier" in

 Latin, moves toward point B, we write AB to represent the vector.

 A vector may also be indicated using a single letter in boldface type, like u, or by
                                                                          

 capping the letter representing the vector with an arrow, like u .

Example 1
 Draw a vector that represents the movement from the point P(-1, 2) to the point Q(3,3)
 By drawing an arrow from the first point to the second,
 we can construct a vector PQ .

Try it Now 
1. Draw a vector, v , that travels from the origin to the point (3, 5).
                                                                Section 8.4 Vectors 541

Using this geometric representation of vectors, we can visualize the addition and scaling
of vectors.

                                                             
To add vectors, we envision a sum of two movements. To find u + v , we first draw the
                                                    
vector u , then from the end of u we drawn the vector v . This corresponds to the

notion that first we move along the first vector, and then from that end position we move
                       
along the second vector. The sum u + v is the new vector that travels directly from the

To add vectors geometrically, draw v starting from the end of                v
                                                      
u . The sum u + v is the vector from the beginning of u to the
    
end of v .                                                                         
                                                                
                                                                u                  u+v

Example 2  
 Given the two vectors shown below, draw u + v

                
                v
    u
                                                                                
                                                                                v

                                                                                   
We draw v starting from the end of u , then draw in the sum               u
                                                                                   u+v
u + v from the beginning of u to the end of v .

Notice that path of the walking woman from the beginning of the section could be
visualized as the sum of two vectors. The resulting sum vector would indicate her end
position relative to home.

Although vectors can exist anywhere in the plane, if we put the starting point at the origin
it is easy to understand its size and direction relative to other vectors.

                                                                
To scale vectors by a constant, such as 3u , we can imagine adding u + u + u . The result

will be a vector three times as long in the same direction as the original vector. If we

were to scale a vector by a negative number, such as - u , we can envision this as the
                       
opposite of u ; the vector so that u + (-u) returns us to the starting point. This vector
                                 
- u would point in the opposite direction as u but have the same length.
542 Chapter 8

Another way to think about scaling a vector is to maintain its direction and multiply its
                                   

length by a constant, so that 3u would point in the same direction but will be 3 times as
long.

Scaling a Vector Geometrically
To geometrically scale a vector by a constant, scale the length of the vector by the
constant.

Scaling a vector by a negative constant will reverse the direction of the vector.

Example 3                                                   

Given the vector shown, draw 3u , - u , and - 2u .          u

                                                          
The vector 3u will be three times as long. The vector - u will have the same length
                                                    
but point in the opposite direction. The vector - 2u will point in the opposite direction

and be twice as long.

                       3u  - 2u
                                        - u

By combining scaling and addition, we can find the difference between vectors
                                    

geometrically as well, since u - v = u + (-v) .

Example 4  
 Given the vectors shown, draw u - v

                                                                    
                       v                                          -v 
             u
                                                                         u
                                                               
                                                               u -v

From the end of u we draw - v , then draw in the result.

Component Form of Vectors

While the geometric interpretation of vectors gives us an intuitive understanding of

vectors, it does not provide us a convenient way to do calculations.           
                                                                               u
For that, we need a handy way to represent vectors. Since a vector

involves a length and direction, it would be logical to want to represent      

a vector using a length and an angle , usually measured from standard

position.

Magnitude and Direction of a Vector
                                                   
A vector u can be described by its magnitude, or length, u , and an angle .

A vector with length 1 is called unit vector.

While this is very reasonable, and a common way to describe vectors, it is often more
convenient for calculations to represent a vector by horizontal and vertical components.

Component Form of a Vector

The component form of a vector represents the vector using two components.

u = x, y indicates the vector represents a displacement of x units horizontally and y

units vertically.
         
         u
                    y

            

          x

            x

Notice how we can see the magnitude of the vector as the length of the hypotenuse of
a right triangle, or in polar form as the radius, r.
544 Chapter 8

Alternate Notation for Vector Components                              

Sometimes you may see vectors written as the combination of unit vectors i and j ,
                                                                    
where i points the right and j points up. In other words, i = 1,0 and j = 0,1 .

                                          
In this notation, the vector u = 3,-4 would be written as u = 3i - 4 j since both

indicate a displacement of 3 units to the right, and 4 units down.

                                                            
While it can be convenient to think of the vector u = x, y as an arrow from the origin to

the point (x, y), be sure to remember that most vectors can be situated anywhere in the
plane, and simply indicate a displacement (change in position) rather than a position.
It is common to need to convert from a magnitude and angle to the component form of
the vector and vice versa. Happily, this process is identical to converting from polar
coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, or from the polar form of complex numbers to the
a+bi form.

Example 5
 Find the component form of a vector with length 7 at an angle of 135 degrees.

 Using the conversion formulas x = r cos( ) and y = r sin( ) , we can find the
 components
  x = 7 cos(135) = - 7 2

                           2
  y = 7 sin(135) = 7 2

                         2

 This vector can be written in component form as - 7 2 , 7 2 .
                                                                     22

Example 6 

 Find the magnitude and angle  representing the vector u = 3,-2 .

 First we can find the magnitude by remembering the relationship between x, y and r:
  r 2 = 32 + (-2)2 = 13
  r = 13

 Second we can find the angle. Using the tangent,
                                                                             Section 8.4 Vectors 545

tan( ) = - 2
            3

         -1 2 
 = tan  -   -33.69 , or written as a coterminal positive angle, 326.31. This

            3
angle is in the 4th quadrant as desired.

3. Using vector v from Try it Now #1, the vector that travels from the origin to the point

    (3, 5), find the components, magnitude and angle  that represent this vector.

In addition to representing distance movements, vectors are commonly used in physics
and engineering to represent any quantity that has both direction and magnitude,
including velocities and forces.

Example 7
 An object is launched with initial velocity 200 meters per second at an angle of 30
 degrees. Find the initial horizontal and vertical velocities.

By viewing the initial velocity as a vector, we can resolve the vector into horizontal and
vertical components.

x = 200 cos(30) = 200  3  173.205 m/sec  200 m/s    100 m/s
                             2
                                              30
y = 200 sin( 30) = 200  1 = 100 m/sec      173 m/s
                            2

This tells us that, absent wind resistance, the object will travel horizontally at about 173
meters each second. Gravity will cause the vertical velocity to change over time - we'll
leave a discussion of that to physics or calculus classes.

Adding and Scaling Vectors in Component Form

To add vectors in component form, we can simply add the corresponding components.
To scale a vector by a constant, we scale each component by that constant.
546 Chapter 8

Combining Vectors in Component Form

To add, subtract, or scale vectors in component form

If u = u1, u2 , v = v1, v2  , and c is any constant, then

u + v = u1 + v1, u2 + v2

u - v = u1 - v1, u2 - v2
  
cu = cu1, cu2

Example 8                             
               
Given u = 3,-2 and v = - 1,4 , find a new vector w = 3u - 2v

Using the vectors given,    Scale each vector
                            Subtract corresponding components
w = 3u - 2v

   = 3 3,-2 - 2 -1,4
   = 9,-6 - - 2,8
   = 11,-14

By representing vectors in component form, we can find the resulting displacement
vector after a multitude of movements without needing to draw a lot of complicated non-
right triangles. For a simple example, we revisit the problem from the opening of the
section. The general procedure we will follow is:

    1) Convert vectors to component form
    2) Add the components of the vectors
    3) Convert back to length and direction if needed to suit the context of the question

Example 9
 A woman leaves home, walks 3 miles north, then 2 miles southeast. How far is she
 from home, and what direction would she need to walk to return home? How far has
 she walked by the time she gets home?

Let's begin by understanding the question in a little more depth.  NW  N  NE
When we use vectors to describe a traveling direction, we often
position things so north points in the upward direction, east      W      E
points to the right, and so on, as pictured here.
                                                                   SW     SE
Consequently, travelling NW, SW, NE or SE, means we are
travelling through the quadrant bordered by the given directions       S
at a 45 degree angle.
                                                       Section 8.4 Vectors 547

With this in mind, we begin by converting each vector to components.
A walk 3 miles north would, in components, be 0,3 .

A walk of 2 miles southeast would be at an angle of 45 South of East. Measuring from
standard position the angle would be 315.

Converting to components, we choose to use the standard position angle so that we do
not have to worry about whether the signs are negative or positive; they will work out
automatically.

2 cos(315), 2sin( 315) = 2  2 , 2  - 2  1.414, -1.414
2  2

                                                                         2

Adding these vectors gives the sum of the movements in component form 3
 0,3 + 1.414,-1.414 = 1.414,1.586

To find how far she is from home and the direction she would need to walk to return
home, we could find the magnitude and angle of this vector.
Length = 1.414 2 + 1.586 2 = 2.125

To find the angle, we can use the tangent
tan( ) = 1.586

          1.414
         -11.586 
 = tan   = 48.273 north of east

           1.414 

Of course, this is the angle from her starting point to her ending point. To return home,
she would need to head the opposite direction, which we could either describe as
180+48.273 = 228.273 measured in standard position, or as 48.273 south of west (or
41.727 west of south).

She has walked a total distance of 3 + 2 + 2.125 = 7.125 miles.

Keep in mind that total distance travelled is not the same as the length of the resulting
displacement vector or the "return" vector.

4. In a scavenger hunt, directions are given to find a buried treasure. From a starting

    point at a flag pole you must walk 30 feet east, turn 30 degrees to the north and travel
    50 feet, and then turn due south and travel 75 feet. Sketch a picture of these vectors,
    find their components, and calculate how far and in what direction you must travel to
    go directly to the treasure from the flag pole without following the map.
548 Chapter 8

While using vectors is not much faster than using law of cosines with only two
movements, when combining three or more movements, forces, or other vector
quantities, using vectors quickly becomes much more efficient than trying to use
triangles.

Example 10
 Three forces are acting on an object as shown below, each measured in Newtons (N).
 What force must be exerted to keep the object in equilibrium (where the sum of the
 forces is zero)?

              6 N

7 N           30

     300
         4 N

We start by resolving each vector into components.

The first vector with magnitude 6 Newtons at an angle of 30 degrees will have
components
 6 cos(30), 6sin( 30) = 6  3 , 6  1 = 3 3,3

                                     22

The second vector is only in the horizontal direction, so can be written as - 7, 0 .

The third vector with magnitude 4 Newtons at an angle of 300 degrees will have
components

 4 cos(300), 4sin( 300) = 4  1 , 4  - 3 = 2, - 2 3
                                       22

To keep the object in equilibrium, we need to find a force vector x, y so the sum of
the four vectors is the zero vector, 0,0 .

3 3, 3 + -7, 0 + 2, - 2 3 + x, y = 0, 0 Add component-wise

3 3 - 7 + 2, 3 + 0 - 2 3 + x, y = 0, 0    Simplify

3 3 - 5, 3 - 2 3 + x, y = 0, 0            Solve

x, y = 0, 0 - 3 3 - 5, 3 - 2 3

x, y = -3 3 + 5, - 3+ 2 3  -0.196, 0.464
                                                 Section 8.4 Vectors 549

This vector gives in components the force that would need to be applied to keep the
object in equilibrium. If desired, we could find the magnitude of this force and
direction it would need to be applied in.

Magnitude = (-0.196)2 + 0.464 2 = 0.504 N

Angle:

    tan( ) = 0.464
              - 0.196

        -1 0.464 
 = tan                  = -67.089 .
         - 0.196 

This is in the wrong quadrant, so we adjust by finding the next angle with the same
tangent value by adding a full period of tangent:

 = -67.089 +180 = 112.911

To keep the object in equilibrium, a force of 0.504 Newtons would need to be applied at
an angle of 112.911.

Section 8.5 Dot Product

Now that we can add, subtract, and scale vectors, you might be wondering whether we
can multiply vectors. It turns out there are two different ways to multiply vectors, one
which results in a number, and one which results in a vector. In this section, we'll focus
on the first, called the dot product or scalar product, since it produces a single numeric
value (a scalar). We'll begin with some motivation.

In physics, we often want to know how much of a force is acting in the direction of
motion. To determine this, we need to know the angle between direction of force and the
direction of motion. Likewise, in computer graphics, the lighting system determines how
bright a triangle on the object should be based on the angle between object and the
direction of the light. In both applications, we're interested in the angle between the
vectors, so let's start there.

                                       
Suppose we have two vectors, a = a1 , a2 and b = b1, b2 . Using our polar coordinate
                                                                           
                                     
conversions, we could write a = a cos( ), a sin( ) and b = b cos( ), b sin(  ) .

Now, if we knew the angles  and , we wouldn't have much work to do -

the angle between the vectors would be  =  -  . While we certainly           

could use some inverse tangents to find the two angles, it would be great

if we could find a way to determine the angle between the vector just         

from the vector components.

To help us manipulate  =  -  , we might try introducing a trigonometric function:

cos( ) = cos( -  )

Now we can apply the difference of angles identity

cos( ) = cos()cos( ) + sin()sin( )

                                 a1
Now a1 = a cos( ) , so cos( ) =  , and likewise for the other three components.
                                 a

Making those substitutions,

a1 b1 a2 b2 a1b1 + a2b2
cos( ) =   +   =  
ab ab                        ab



a b cos( ) = a1b1 + a2b2

Notice the expression on the right is a very simple calculation based on the components
of the vectors. It comes up so frequently we define it to be the dot product of the two
vectors, notated by a dot. This gives us two definitions of the dot product.
                                                   Section 8.5 Dot Product 555

Definitions of the Dot Product

a  b = a1b1 + a2b2  Component definition

                    Geometric definition

a  b = a b cos( )

                         
The first definition, a  b = a1b1 + a2b2 , gives us a simple way to calculate the dot product

                                                       

from components. The second definition, a  b = a b cos( ) , gives us a geometric

interpretation of the dot product, and gives us a way to find the angle between two
vectors, as we desired.

Example 1
 Find the dot product 3,-2  5,1 .

 Using the first definition, we can calculate the dot product by multiplying the x
 components and adding that to the product of the y components.

   3,-2  5,1 = (3)(5) + (-2)(1) = 15 - 2 = 13

Example 2

Find the dot product of the two vectors shown.

                                                                     6

We can immediately see that the magnitudes of the         7          30

two vectors are 7 and 6. We can quickly calculate

that the angle between the vectors is 150. Using the geometric definition of the dot

product,

a b = a b cos ( ) = (6)(7) cos(150) = 42  - 3 = -21 3 .

                                                       2

Now we can return to our goal of finding the angle between vectors.
556 Chapter 8

Example 3
 An object is being pulled up a ramp in the direction 5,1 by a
 rope pulling in the direction 4,2 . What is the angle between
 the rope and the ramp?

 Using the component form, we can easily calculate the dot product.
  
  a  b = 5,1  4,2 = (5)(4) + (1)(2) = 20 + 2 = 22

We can also calculate the magnitude of each vector.
                    22
a = 5 + 1 = 26 , b = 4 + 2 = 2022

Substituting these values into the geometric definition, we can solve for the angle
between the vectors.
  

a  b = a b cos( )

22 = 26 20 cos( )

 = cos -1   22   15.255 .
            26 20 

Example 4
 Calculate the angle between the vectors 6,4 and - 2,3 .

Calculating the dot product, 6,4  - 2,3 = (6)(-2) + (4)(3) = -12 + 12 = 0

We don't even need to calculate the magnitudes in this case since the dot product is 0.
  

a  b = a b cos( )

     

0 = a b cos( )

     
     0
 = cos  -1    = cos (0) = 90-1

     ab 
     

With the dot product equaling zero, as in the last example, the angle between the vectors
will always be 90, indicating that the vectors are orthogonal, a more general way of
saying perpendicular. This gives us a quick way to check if vectors are orthogonal.
Also, if the dot product is positive, then the inside of the inverse cosine will be positive,
giving an angle less than 90. A negative dot product will then lead to an angle larger
than 90

Projections

In addition to finding the angle between vectors, sometimes we
want to know how much one vector points in the direction of
another. For example, when pulling an object up a ramp, we
might want to know how much of the force is exerted in the direction of motion. To
determine this we can use the idea of a projection.

                          a                   
      a                          v
                    
                    b         b

                             u

                                              
In the picture above, u is a projection of a onto b . In other words, it is the portion of
                             
a that points in the same direction as b .

                        
To find the length of u , we could notice that it is one side of a right triangle. If we
                                                
                                                u                            
define  to be the angle between a and u , then cos( ) =  , so a cos( ) = u .
                                                a

While we could find the angle between the vectors to determine this magnitude, we could
                                                  
skip some steps by using the dot product directly. Since a b = a b cos( ) ,
                                                                  
             a b                                              ab
a cos( ) =  . Using this, we can rewrite u = a cos( ) as u =  . This gives us
             b                                                  b
                                                             
                                                   ab
the length of the projection, sometimes denoted as compb a = u =  .

                                                               b
To find the vector u itself, we could first scale b to a unit vector with length 1:  .

Multiplying this by the length of the projection will give a vector in the direction of b

 Find the projection of the vector 3,-2 onto the vector 8,6 .

 We will need to know the dot product of the vectors and the
 magnitude of the vector we are projecting onto.
   3,-2  8,6 = (3)(8) + (-2)(6) = 24 -12 = 12

   8,6 = 82 + 62 = 64 + 36 = 100 = 10

Work

In physics, when a constant force causes an object to move, the mechanical work done
by that force is the product of the force and the distance the object is moved. However,
we only consider the portion of force that is acting in the direction of motion.

This is simply the magnitude of the projection of the force
                                                              
      F d
vector onto the distance vector,  . The work done is the      F                       

      d d
product of that component of force times the distance moved,            u

the magnitude of the distance vector.
              
          Fd 

Work =    d = F  d
         d 
         

It turns out that work is simply the dot product of the force vector and the distance vector.

Work  
When a force F causes an object to move some distance d , the work done is

         
Work = F d

Example 6                                                                  30 pounds

Since work is simply the dot product, we can take                          20 feet
advantage of the geometric definition of the dot product in this case.

Section 8.6 Parametric Equations

Many shapes, even ones as simple as circles, cannot be represented as an equation where
y is a function of x. Consider, for example, the path a moon follows as it orbits around a
planet, which simultaneously rotates around a sun. In some cases, polar equations
provide a way to represent such a path. In others, we need a more versatile approach that
allows us to represent both the x and y coordinates in terms of a third variable, or
parameter.

Parametric Equations

A system of parametric equations is a pair of functions x(t) and y(t) in which the x
and y coordinates are the output, represented in terms of a third input parameter, t.

Example 1
 Moving at a constant speed, an object moves at a steady rate along a straight path from
 coordinates (-5, 3) to the coordinates (3, -1) in 4 seconds, where the coordinates are
 measured in meters. Find parametric equations for the position of the object.

The x coordinate of the object starts at -5 meters, and goes to +3 meters, this means the

x direction has changed by 8 meters in 4 seconds, giving us a rate of 2 meters per

second. We can now write the x coordinate as a linear function with respect to time, t,

x(t) = -5 + 2t . Similarly, the y value starts at 3 and goes to -1, giving a change in y

value of 4 meters, meaning the y values have decreased by

4 meters in 4 seconds, for a rate of -1 meter per second,  t x y
giving equation y(t) = 3 - t . Together, these are the     0 -5 3

parametric equations for the position of the object:       1 -3 2
x(t) = -5 + 2t                                             2 -1 1

y(t) = 3 - t                                               31 0
                                                           4 3 -1

Using these equations, we can build a table of t, x, and y
values. Because of the context, we limited ourselves to non-negative t values for this
example, but in general you can use any values.

From this table, we could create three possible graphs: a graph of x vs. t, which would
show the horizontal position over time, a graph of y vs. t, which would show the vertical
position over time, or a graph of y vs. x, showing the position of the object in the plane.
564 Chapter 8                         Position of y as a function of time
 Position of x as a function of time

Position of y relative to x

Notice that the parameter t does not explicitly show up in this third graph. Sometimes,
when the parameter t does represent a quantity like time, we might indicate the direction
of movement on the graph using an arrow, as shown above.

There is often no single parametric representation for a curve. In

Example 1 we assumed the object was moving at a steady rate

along a straight line. If we kept the assumption about the path            t

(straight line) but did not assume the speed was constant, we might

get a system like:

x(t) = -5 + 2t 2

y(t) = 3 - t 2

This starts at (-5, 3) when t = 0 and ends up at (3, -1)
when t = 2. If we graph the x(t) and y(t) function
separately, we can see that those are no longer linear,
but if we graph x vs. y we will see that we still get a
straight-line path.

Example 2

Sketch a graph of                                                tx y
x(t) = t 2 + 1                                                   -3 10 -1

y(t) = 2 + t

                                                                 -1 2 1

We can begin by creating a table of values. From this table, we 0 1 2

can plot the (x, y) points in the plane, sketch in a rough graph of 1 2 3

the curve, and indicate the direction of motion with respect to  25 4
time by using arrows.

Notice that here the parametric equations describe a shape for which y is not a function of
x. This is an example of why using parametric equations can be useful - since they can
represent such a graph as a set of functions. This particular graph also appears to be a
parabola where x is a function of y, which we will soon verify.

Example 3                                                              (rcos(), rsin())
 Sketch a graph of
  x(t) = 3cos(t)                                                 r
                                                                       y
  y(t) = 3sin(t)
                                                                  
 These equations should look familiar. Back when we first         x
 learned about sine and cosine we found that the coordinates
 of a point on a circle of radius r at an angle of  will be
  x = r cos( ), y = r sin( ) . The equations above are in the
 same form, with r = 3, and t used in place of .

 This suggests that for each value of t, these parametric
 equations give a point on a circle of radius 3 at the angle
 corresponding to t. At t = 0 , the graph would be at
  x = 3cos(0), y = 3sin(0) , the point (3,0). Indeed, these
 equations describe the equation of a circle, drawn
 counterclockwise.
566 Chapter 8

 Interestingly, these similar parametric equations also describe the circle of radius 3:
  x(t) = 3sin(t)
  y(t) = 3cos(t)

 The difference with these equations it the graph would start at x = 3sin(0), y = 3cos(0) ,
 the point (0,3). As t increases from 0, the x value will increase, indicating these
 equations would draw the graph in a clockwise direction.

While creating a t-x-y table, plotting points and connecting the dots with a smooth curve
usually works to give us a rough idea of what the graph of a system of parametric
equations looks like, it's generally easier to use technology to create these tables and
(simultaneously) much nicer-looking graphs.

Example 4

Sketch a graph of  x(t) = 2 cos(t)  .

                   y(t) = 3sin( t)

Notice first that this equation looks very similar to the ones
from the previous example, except the coefficients are not
equal. You might guess that the pairing of cos and sin will
still produce rotation, but now x will vary from -2 to 2 while
y will vary from -3 to 3, creating an ellipse.

Using technology we can generate a graph of this equation,
verifying it is indeed an ellipse.

Similar to graphing polar equations, you must change the MODE on your calculator (or
select parametric equations on your graphing technology) before graphing a system of
parametric equations. You will know you have successfully entered parametric mode
when the equation input has changed to ask for a x(t)= and y(t)= pair of equations.

For each input t, we can determine the number of rabbits, r, and the number of wolves,
w, from the respective graphs, and then plot the corresponding point in the r-w plane.

This graph helps reveal the cyclical interaction between the two populations.

Converting from Parametric to Cartesian

In some cases, it is possible to eliminate the parameter t, allowing you to write a pair of
parametric equations as a Cartesian equation.

It is easiest to do this if one of the x(t) or y(t) functions can easily be solved for t,
allowing you to then substitute the remaining expression into the second part.

Example 6

Write         x(t) = t 2 + 1  as a Cartesian equation, if possible.

              y(t) = 2 + t

Here, the equation for y is linear, so is relatively easy to solve for t. Since the resulting
Cartesian equation will likely not be a function, and for convenience, we drop the
function notation.
568 Chapter 8

y =2+t               Solve for t
y-2=t                Substitute this for t in the x equation
x = ( y - 2)2 +1

Notice that this is the equation of a parabola with x as a function of y, with vertex at
(1,2), opening to the right. Comparing this with the graph from Example 2, we see
(unsurprisingly) that it yields the same graph in the x-y plane as did the original
parametric equations.

Try it Now
              x(t) = t 3

2. Write y(t) = t 6 as a Cartesian equation, if possible.

Example 7
 Write x(t) = t + 2 as a Cartesian equation, if possible.
          y(t) = log( t)

We could solve either the first or second equation for t. Solving the first,

x= t +2

x-2= t               Square both sides
                     Substitute into the y equation
(x - 2)2 = t

y = log ((x - 2)2 )

Since the parametric equation is only defined for t  0 , this Cartesian equation is
equivalent to the parametric equation on the corresponding domain. The parametric
equations show that when t > 0, x > 2 and y > 0, so the domain of the Cartesian equation
should be limited to x > 2.

To ensure that the Cartesian equation is as equivalent as possible to the original
parametric equation, we try to avoid using domain-restricted inverse functions, such as
the inverse trig functions, when possible. For equations involving trig functions, we
often try to find an identity to utilize to avoid the inverse functions.
                                         Section 8.6 Parametric Equations 569

Example 8

Write  x(t) = 2 cos(t)    as a Cartesian equation, if possible.

       y(t) = 3sin( t)

To rewrite this, we can utilize the Pythagorean identity cos2 (t) + sin 2 (t) = 1.
x = 2 cos(t) so x = cos(t)

                   2
y = 3sin( t) so y = sin( t)

                  3

Starting with the Pythagorean Identity,

cos2 (t) + sin 2 (t) = 1  Substitute in the expressions from the parametric form

 x 2  y 2                 Simplify
  +  =1

x2 + y2 =1
49

This is a Cartesian equation for the ellipse we graphed earlier.

Parameterizing Curves

While converting from parametric form to Cartesian can be useful, it is often more useful
to parameterize a Cartesian equation - converting it into parametric form.

If the Cartesian equation gives one variable as a function of the other, then
parameterization is trivial - the independent variable in the function can simply be
defined as t.

Example 9
 Parameterize the equation x = y3 - 2y .

 In this equation, x is expressed as a function of y. By defining y = t we can then
 substitute that into the Cartesian equation, yielding x = t 3 - 2t . Together, this produces
 the parametric form:
  x(t) = t 3 - 2t
  y(t) = t
570 Chapter 8

Try it Now
3. Write x2 + y 2= 3 in parametric form, if possible.

In addition to parameterizing Cartesian equations, we also can parameterize behaviors
and movements.

Example 10
 A robot follows the path shown. Create a table of values for the
 x(t) and y(t) functions, assuming the robot takes one second to
 make each movement.

Since we know the direction of motion, we can introduce
consecutive values for t along the path of the robot. Using these
values with the x and y coordinates of the robot, we can create the
tables. For example, we designate the starting point, at (1, 1), as
the position at t = 0, the next point at (3, 1) as the position at t = 1,
and so on.

t 0123456        t 0123456
x 1 3 3 2 4 1 1  y 1 1 2 2 4 5 4

Notice how this also ties back to vectors. The journey of the robot as it moves through
the Cartesian plane could also be displayed as vectors and total distance traveled and
displacement could be calculated.

Example 11
 A light is placed on the edge of a bicycle tire as shown and the bicycle starts rolling
 down the street. Find a parametric equation for the position of the light after the wheel
 has rotated through an angle of .

r                                                            
     Starting                                          Rotated by 

Relative to the center of the wheel, the position of the light can be found as the
coordinates of a point on a circle, but since the x coordinate begins at 0 and moves in
the negative direction, while the y coordinate starts at the lowest value, the coordinates
of the point will be given by:
                                                           Section 8.6 Parametric Equations 571

x = -r sin( )
y = -r cos( )

The center of the wheel, meanwhile, is moving horizontally. It remains at a constant
height of r, but the horizontal position will move a distance equivalent to the arclength

of the circle drawn out by the angle, s = r . The position of the center of the circle is

then
x = r
y=r

Combining the position of the center of the wheel with the position of the light on the
wheel relative to the center, we get the following parametric equationw, with  as the
parameter:

x = r - r sin( ) = r( - sin( ))
y = r - r cos( ) = r(1- cos( ))

The result graph is called a cycloid.

Example 12                                              6
 A moon travels around a planet        30
 as shown, orbiting once every 10
 days. The planet travels around
 a sun as shown, orbiting once
 every 100 days. Find a
 parametric equation for the
 position of the moon, relative to
 the center of the sun, after t days.

 For this example, we'll assume
 the orbits are circular, though in
 real life they're actually
 elliptical.
572 Chapter 8

The coordinates of a point on a circle can always be written in the form
x = r cos( )

y = r sin( )

Since the orbit of the moon around the planet has a period of 10 days, the equation for
the position of the moon relative to the planet will be

 2              
x(t) = 6 cos t  = 6 cos t 
 10            5 

 2              
y(t) = 6 sin  t  = 6 sin  t 
 10            5 

With a period of 100 days, the equation for the position of the planet relative to the sun
will be

 2              
x(t) = 30 cos t  = 30 cos t 
100             50 

 2              
y(t) = 30 sin  t  = 30 sin  t 
100             50 

Combining these together, we can find the
position of the moon relative to the sun as the
sum of the components.

                
x(t) = 6 cos t  + 30 cos t 
5               50 

                
y(t) = 6 sin  t  + 30 sin  t

In this chapter, we will explore a set of shapes defined by a common characteristic: they
can all be formed by slicing a cone with a plane. These families of curves have a broad
range of applications in physics and astronomy, from describing the shape of your car
headlight reflectors to describing the orbits of planets and comets.

Section 9.1 Ellipses

The National Statuary Hall1 in Washington, D.C. is an
oval-shaped room called a whispering chamber because
the shape makes it possible for sound to reflect from the
walls in a special way. Two people standing in specific
places are able to hear each other whispering even
though they are far apart. To determine where they
should stand, we will need to better understand ellipses.

An ellipse is a type of conic section, a shape resulting from intersecting a plane with a
cone and looking at the curve where they intersect. They were discovered by the Greek
mathematician Menaechmus over two millennia ago.
The figure below2 shows two types of conic sections. When a plane is perpendicular to
the axis of the cone, the shape of the intersection is a circle. A slightly titled plane
creates an oval-shaped conic section called an ellipse.

An ellipse can be drawn by placing two thumbtacks in a piece of
cardboard then cutting a piece of string longer than the distance
between the thumbtacks. Tack each end of the string to the
cardboard, and trace a curve with a pencil held taught against
the string. An ellipse is the set of all points where the sum of
the distances from two fixed points is constant. The length of
the string is the constant, and the two thumbtacks are the fixed
points, called foci.

Ellipse Definition and Vocabulary

An ellipse is the set of all points Q(x, y) for which the sum of the distance to two
fixed points F1(x1, y1) and F2(x2, y2 ), called the foci (plural of focus), is a constant k:
d(Q, F1)+ d(Q, F2 ) = k .

                                        y

                                                 Q

    d(Q,F1)

             d(Q,F2)

F2                    F1

The major axis is the line passing through the foci.
Vertices are the points on the ellipse which intersect the major axis.
The major axis length is the length of the line segment between the vertices.
The center is the midpoint between the vertices (or the midpoint between the foci).
The minor axis is the line perpendicular to the minor axis passing through the center.
Minor axis endpoints are the points on the ellipse which intersect the minor axis.
The minor axis endpoints are also sometimes called co-vertices.
The minor axis length is the length of the line segment between minor axis endpoints.

                                                                                 y

Note that which axis is major and which is minor     Vertices          Major axis
will depend on the orientation of the ellipse. In                            Minor axis
the ellipse shown at right, the foci lie on the y
axis, so that is the major axis, and the x axis is                 Foci endpoints
the minor axis. Because of this, the vertices are                              x
the endpoints of the ellipse on the y axis, and the
minor axis endpoints (co-vertices) are the                                 Minor axis
endpoints on the x axis.
                                                                  Section 9.1 Ellipses 581

Ellipses Centered at the Origin

From the definition above we can find an equation for an ellipse. We will find it for a

ellipse centered at the origin C(0,0) with foci at F1(c,0) and F2(- c,0) where c > 0.

Suppose Q(x, y) is some point on the ellipse. The distance from F1 to Q is
d(Q, F1) = (x - c)2 + (y - 0)2 = (x - c)2 + y2

Likewise, the distance from F2 to Q is

d(Q, F2 ) = (x - (- c))2 + (y - 0)2 = (x + c)2 + y2

From the definition of the ellipse, the sum of these distances should be constant:

d(Q, F1)+ d(Q, F2 ) = k so that

 (x - c)2 + y2 + (x + c)2 + y2 = k

If we label one of the vertices (a,0), it should satisfy the equation above since it is a

point on the ellipse. This allows us to write k in terms of a.

  (a - c)2 + 02 + (a + c)2 + 02 = k

a-c + a+c =k                                            Since a > c, these will be positive

(a - c) + (a + c) = k

2a = k

Substituting that into our equation, we will now try to rewrite the equation in a friendlier
form.

  (x - c)2 + y2 + (x + c)2 + y2 = 2a                    Move one radical

  (x - c)2 + y2 = 2a - (x + c)2 + y2                    Square both sides
                                                        Expand
        2                               2
 (x - c)2 + y2  =  2a - (x + c)2 + y2 
                                      

(x - c)2 + y2 = 4a2 - 4a (x + c)2 + y2 + (x + c)2 + y2  Expand more

x2 - 2xc + c2 + y2 = 4a2 - 4a (x + c)2 + y2 + x2 + 2xc + c2 + y2

Combining like terms and isolating the radical leaves   Divide by 4

4a (x + c)2 + y2 = 4a2 + 4xc                            Square both sides again
                                                        Expand
a (x + c)2 + y2 = a2 + xc                               Distribute

a2 ((x + c)2 + y2 )= a4 + 2a2xc + x2c2
a2 (x2 + 2xc + c2 + y2 )= a4 + 2a2xc + x2c2
582 Chapter 9

a2x2 + 2a2xc + a2c2 + a2 y2 = a4 + 2a2xc + x2c2  Combine like terms
                                                 Factor common terms
a2x2 - x2c2 + a2 y2 = a4 - a2c2

(a2 - c2 )x2 + a2 y2 = a2 (a2 - c2 )

Let b2 = a2 - c2 . Since a > c, we know b > 0.   Substituting b2 for a2 - c2 leaves
b2x2 + a2 y2 = a2b2                                            Divide both sides by a2b2

This is the standard equation for an ellipse. We typically swap a and b when the major
axis of the ellipse is vertical.

Equation of an Ellipse Centered at the Origin in Standard Form

The standard form of an equation of an ellipse centered at the origin C(0,0) depends

on whether the major axis is horizontal or vertical. The table below gives the standard
equation, vertices, minor axis endpoints, foci, and graph for each.

Example 1
 Put the equation of the ellipse 9x2 + y2 = 9 in standard form. Find the vertices, minor
 axis endpoints, length of the major axis, and length of the minor axis. Sketch the graph,
 then check using a graphing utility.
 The standard equation has a 1 on the right side, so this equation can be put in standard
 form by dividing by 9:
   x2 + y2 =1
   19
 Since the y-denominator is greater than the x-denominator, the ellipse has a vertical
                                                                              x2 y2
 major axis. Comparing to the general standard form equation 2 + 2 = 1, we see the
                                                                              ba
 value of a = 9 = 3 and the value of b = 1 =1.
 The vertices lie on the y-axis at (0,켥) = (0, 3).
 The minor axis endpoints lie on the x-axis at (켦, 0) = (1, 0).

 The length of the major axis is 2(a) = 2(3) = 6 .
 The length of the minor axis is 2(b) = 2(1) = 2 .

 To sketch the graph we plot the vertices and the minor axis endpoints. Then we sketch
 the ellipse, rounding at the vertices and the minor axis endpoints.

 To check on a graphing utility, we must solve the equation for y. Isolating y2 gives us

 y2 = 9(1- x2 )

 Taking the square root of both sides we get
  y = 3 1- x2

 Under Y= on your graphing utility enter the two halves of the ellipse as y = 3 1- x2
 and y = -3 1- x2 . Set the window to a comparable scale to the sketch with xmin = -5,
 xmax = 5, ymin= -5, and ymax = 5.

Example 2
 Find the standard form of the equation for an ellipse centered at (0,0) with horizontal
 major axis length 28 and minor axis length 16.

Since the center is at (0,0) and the major axis is horizontal, the ellipse equation has the

Ellipses Not Centered at the Origin

Not all ellipses are centered at the origin. The graph of such an ellipse is a shift of the
graph centered at the origin, so the standard equation for one centered at (h, k) is slightly
different. We can shift the graph right h units and up k units by replacing x with x - h
and y with y - k, similar to what we did when we learned transformations.

The standard form of an equation of an ellipse centered at the point C (h, k ) depends

Looking at the x terms, x2 + 2x , we like to have something of the form (x + n)2 . Notice

that if we were to expand this, we'd get x2 + 2nx + n2 , so in order for the coefficient on
x to match, we'll need (x +1)2 = x2 + 2x +1. However, we don't have a +1 on the left

side of the equation to allow this factoring. To accommodate this, we will add 1 to both
sides of the equation, which then allows us to factor the left side as a perfect square:
x2 + 2x +1+ 4y2 - 24 y = -33 +1

(x +1)2 + 4y2 - 24 y = -32

Repeating the same approach with the y terms, first we'll factor out the 4.
4y2 - 24 y = 4( y2 - 6y)

Now we want to be able to write 4(y2 - 6y) as 4( y + n)2 = 4(y2 + 2ny + n2 ).

For the coefficient of y to match, n will have to -3, giving

4( y - 3)2 = 4(y2 - 6y + 9)= 4y2 - 24 y + 36 .

To allow this factoring, we can add 36 to both sides of the equation.
(x +1)2 + 4y2 - 24 y + 36 = -32 + 36

(x +1)2 + 4(y2 - 6y + 9)= 4

(x +1)2 + 4(y - 3)2 = 4

Dividing by 4 gives the standard form of the equation for the ellipse

(x +1)2 + (y - 3)2 = 1
4  1

Since the x-denominator is greater than the y-denominator, the ellipse has a horizontal

                                             ( x - h)2 ( y - k )2

major axis. From the general standard equation a2 + b2 = 1 we see the value

of a = 4 = 2 and the value of b = 1 =1.

The center is at (h, k) = (-1, 3).
The vertices are at (h켥, k) or (-3, 3) and (1,3).
The minor axis endpoints are at (h, k켦) or (-1, 2) and (-1,4).
                                                                          Section 9.1 Ellipses 587

The length of the major axis is 2(a) = 2(2) = 4 .
The length of the minor axis is 2(b) = 2(1) = 2 .

To sketch the graph we plot the vertices and the minor axis endpoints. Then we sketch
the ellipse, rounding at the vertices and the minor axis endpoints.

Example 5
 Find the standard form of the equation for an ellipse centered at (-2,1), a vertex at (-2,4)
 and passing through the point (0,1).

The center at (-2,1) and vertex at (-2,4) means the major axis is vertical since the x-

                                                             (x - h)2 (y - k )2

values are the same. The ellipse equation has the standard form b2 + a2 = 1 .

The value of a = 4-1=3. Substituting a = 3, h = -2, and k = 1 gives

(x + 2)2 (y -1)2

  b2 + 32 = 1 . Substituting for x and y using the point (0,1) gives

(0 + 2)2 (1-1)2

  b2 + 32 = 1.

Solving for b gives b=2.

                                            (x + 2)2 (y -1)2

The equation of the ellipse in standard form is 22 + 32 = 1 or

(x + 2)2 + (y -1)2 = 1.

Bridges with Semielliptical Arches

Arches have been used to build bridges for centuries, like
in the Skerton Bridge in England which uses five
semielliptical arches for support3. Semielliptical arches
can have engineering benefits such as allowing for longer
spans between supports.

Example 6
 A bridge over a river is supported by a single semielliptical arch. The river is 50 feet
 wide. At the center, the arch rises 20 feet above the river. The roadway is 4 feet above
 the center of the arch. What is the vertical distance between the roadway and the arch
 15 feet from the center?

 Put the center of the ellipse at (0,0) and make the span of the river the major axis.

                                                             y

Since the major axis is horizontal, the equation has the form 2 + 2 = 1.

                                                                           ab

Substituting x = 15 gives 2 + 2 = 1 . Solving for y, y = 20 1- = 16 .
                  25 20                                     625

The roadway is 20 + 4 = 24 feet above the river. The vertical distance between the
roadway and the arch 15 feet from the center is 24 - 16 = 8 feet.

Ellipse Foci

The location of the foci can play a key role in ellipse application problems. Standing on a
focus in a whispering gallery allows you to hear someone whispering at the other focus.
To find the foci, we need to find the length from the center to the foci, c, using the
equation b2 = a2 - c2 . It looks similar to, but is not the same as, the Pythagorean
Theorem.

Example 7
 The National Statuary Hall whispering chamber is an elliptical room 46 feet wide and
 96 feet long. To hear each other whispering, two people need to stand at the foci of the
 ellipse. Where should they stand?

 We could represent the hall with a horizontal ellipse centered at the origin. The major
 axis length would be 96 feet, so a = 1 (96) = 48 , and the minor axis length would be 46

                                               2
 feet, so b = 1 (46) = 23 . To find the foci, we can use the equation b2 = a2 - c2 .

                2
  232 = 482 - c2
  c2 = 482 - 232
  c = 1775  42 ft.

 To hear each other whisper, two people would need to stand 2(42) = 84 feet apart along
 the major axis, each about 48 - 42 = 6 feet from the wall.

Example 8

Find the foci of the ellipse  (x - 2)2 (y + 3)2  = 1.
                                 +

                                                (x - h)2 (y - k )2

The ellipse is vertical with an equation of the form b2 + a2 = 1 .
The center is at (h, k) = (2, -3). The foci are at (h, k  c).

To find length c we use b2 = a2 - c2 .
Substituting gives 4 = 29 - c2 or c = 25 = 5 .

The ellipse has foci (2, -3  5), or (2, -8) and (2, 2).
590 Chapter 9

Example 9
 Find the standard form of the equation for an ellipse with foci (-1,4) and (3,4) and major
 axis length 10.

Since the foci differ in the x -coordinates, the ellipse is horizontal with an equation of

         (x - h)2 (h - k )2

the form a2 + b2 = 1 .

The value of a is half the major axis length: a = 1 (10) = 5 .
                                                            2

The value of c is half the distance between the foci: c = 1 (3 - (-1)) = 1 (4) = 2 .

To find length b we use b2 = a2 - c2 . Substituting a and c gives b2 = 52 - 22 = 21.

Planetary Orbits

It was long thought that planetary orbits around the
sun were circular. Around 1600, Johannes Kepler
discovered they were actually elliptical4. His first law
of planetary motion says that planets travel around the
sun in an elliptical orbit with the sun as one of the foci.
The length of the major axis can be found by measuring the planet's aphelion, its greatest
distance from the sun, and perihelion, its shortest distance from the sun, and summing
them together.

4 Technically, they're approximately elliptical. The orbits of the planets are not exactly elliptical because
of interactions with each other and other celestial bodies.
                                                                            Section 9.1 Ellipses 591

Example 10
 Mercury's aphelion is 35.98 million miles and its perihelion is 28.58 million miles.
 Write an equation for Mercury's orbit.

 Let the center of the ellipse be (0,0) and its major axis be horizontal so the equation will
                x2 y2

 have form 2 + 2 = 1.
                ab

 The length of the major axis is 2a = 35.98 + 28.58 = 64.56 giving a = 32.28 and
  a2 = 1041 .9984 .

 Since the perihelion is the distance from the focus to one vertex, we can find the
 distance between the foci by subtracting twice the perihelion from the major axis

 length: 2c = 64.56- 2(28.58) = 7.4 giving c = 3.7 .

 Substitution of a and c into b2 = a2 - c2 yields b2 = 32.282 - 3.72 = 1028 .3084 .

 The equation is x2 + y2 = 1 .

75. Planetary Orbits The orbits of planets around the sun are approximately elliptical
     with the sun as a focus. The aphelion is a planet's greatest distance from the sun and
     the perihelion is its shortest. The length of the major axis is the sum of the aphelion
     and the perihelion. Earth's aphelion is 94.51 million miles and its perihelion is
     91.40 million miles. Write an equation for Earth's orbit.

76. Satellite Orbits The orbit of a satellite around Earth is elliptical with Earth's center
     as a focus. The satellite's maximum height above the Earth is 170 miles and its
     minimum height above the Earth is 90 miles. Write an equation for the satellite's
     orbit. Assume Earth is spherical and has a radius of 3960 miles.

77. Eccentricity e of an ellipse is the ratio c where c is the distance of a focus from the

     center and a is the distance of a vertex from the center. Write an equation for an
     ellipse with eccentricity 0.8 and foci at (-4,0) and (4,0).

Section 9.2 Hyperbolas

In the last section, we learned that planets have
approximately elliptical orbits around the sun. When an
object like a comet is moving quickly, it is able to escape
the gravitational pull of the sun and follows a path with the
shape of a hyperbola. Hyperbolas are curves that can help
us find the location of a ship, describe the shape of cooling towers, or calibrate
seismological equipment.
The hyperbola is another type of conic section created by intersecting a plane with a
double cone, as shown below5.

The word "hyperbola" derives from a Greek word meaning "excess." The English word
"hyperbole" means exaggeration. We can think of a hyperbola as an excessive or
exaggerated ellipse, one turned inside out.
We defined an ellipse as the set of all points where the sum of the distances from that
point to two fixed points is a constant. A hyperbola is the set of all points where the
absolute value of the difference of the distances from the point to two fixed points is a
constant.

Hyperbola Definition

A hyperbola is the set of all points Q(x, y) for which the absolute value of the
difference of the distances to two fixed points F1(x1, y1) and F2(x2, y2 ) called the foci

(plural for focus) is a constant k: d (Q, F1 )- d (Q, F2 ) = k .

                                                              F2

The transverse axis is the line passing through the foci.
Vertices are the points on the hyperbola which intersect the transverse axis.
The transverse axis length is the length of the line segment between the vertices.
The center is the midpoint between the vertices (or the midpoint between the foci).
The other axis of symmetry through the center is the conjugate axis.
The two disjoint pieces of the curve are called branches.
A hyperbola has two asymptotes.

Which axis is the transverse axis will depend on the orientation of the hyperbola. As a
helpful tool for graphing hyperbolas, it is common to draw a central rectangle as a
guide. This is a rectangle drawn around the center with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes that pass through each vertex and co-vertex. The asymptotes will follow the
diagonals of this rectangle.

Hyperbolas Centered at the Origin

From the definition above we can find an equation of a hyperbola. We will find it for a

hyperbola centered at the origin C(0,0) opening horizontally with foci at F1(c,0) and
F2(- c,0) where c > 0.

Suppose Q(x, y) is a point on the hyperbola. The distances from Q to F1 and Q to F2 are:

d(Q, F1) = (x - c)2 + (y - 0)2 = (x - c)2 + y2
d(Q, F2 ) = (x - (- c))2 + (y - 0)2 = (x + c)2 + y2 .

From the definition, the absolute value of the difference should be constant:

d (Q, F1)- d (Q, F2 ) = (x - c)2 + y2 - (x + c)2 + y2 = k

Substituting in one of the vertices (a,0), we can determine k in terms of a:

  (a - c)2 + 02 - (a + c)2 + 02 = k

a-c - a+c =k                                     Since c > a, a - c = c - a
(c - a) - (a + c) = k
k = - 2a = 2a

Using k = 2a and removing the absolute values,   Move one radical

 (x - c)2 + y2 - (x + c)2 + y2 = 2a

(x - c)2 + y2 = 2a + (x + c)2 + y2               Square both sides

(x - c)2 + y2 = 4a2  4a (x + c)2 + y2 + (x + c)2 + y2 Expand

x2 - 2xc + c2 + y2 = 4a2  4a (x + c)2 + y2 + x2 + 2xc + c2 + y2

Combining like terms leaves                      Divide by 4

- 4xc = 4a2  4a (x + c)2 + y2                    Isolate the radical

- xc = a2  a (x + c)2 + y2                       Square both sides again
                                                 Expand and distribute
 a (x + c)2 + y2 = -a2 - xc                      Combine like terms
                                                 Factor common terms
a2 ((x + c)2 + y2 )= a4 + 2a2xc + x2c2

a2x2 + 2a2xc + a2c2 + a2 y2 = a4 + 2a2xc + x2c2
a2 y2 + a2c2 - a4 = x2c2 - a2x2
600 Chapter 9

a2 y2 + a2 (c2 - a2 )= (c2 - a2 )x2

Let b2 = c2 - a2 . Since c > a, b > 0. Substituting b2 for c2 - a2 leaves

a2 y2 + a2b2 = b2x2                     Divide both sides by a2b2

We can see from the graphs of the hyperbolas that the branches appear to approach
asymptotes as x gets large in the negative or positive direction. The equations of the
horizontal hyperbola asymptotes can be derived from its standard equation.

The standard form of an equation of a hyperbola centered at the origin C (0,0) depends on

whether it opens horizontally or vertically. The following table gives the standard

The equation can be put in standard form y2 - x2 = 1 by dividing by 4.       4 = 2 and

602 Chapter 9
 Since the x term is subtracted, the hyperbola opens vertically and the vertices lie on the
 y-axis at (0,켥) = (0, 2).

 The length of the transverse axis is 2(a) = 2(2) = 4 .

 Equations of the asymptotes are y =  a x or = 2x .
                                                  b

 To sketch the graph we plot the vertices of the construction rectangle at (켦,켥) or
 (-1,-2), (-1,2), (1,-2), and (1,2). The asymptotes are drawn through the diagonals of the
 rectangle and the vertices plotted. Then we sketch in the hyperbola, rounded at the
 vertices and approaching the asymptotes.

 To check on a graphing utility, we must solve the equation for y. Isolating y2 gives us

 y2 = 4(1+ x2 ).

 Taking the square root of both sides we find y = 2 1+ x2 .
 Under Y= enter the two halves of the hyperbola and the two asymptotes as
  y = 2 1+ x2 , y = -2 1+ x2 , y = 2x , and y = -2x . Set the window to a comparable
 scale to the sketch with xmin = -4, xmax = 4, ymin= -3, and ymax = 3.

Sometimes we are given the equation. Sometimes we need to find the equation from a
graph or other information.

Example 4
 Write an equation for the hyperbola in the graph
 shown.

 The center is at (2,3), where the asymptotes cross.
 It opens vertically, so the equation will look like

 (y - 3)2 (x - 2)2

     a2 - b2 =1.

 The vertices are at (2,2) and (2,4). The distance
 from the center to a vertex is a = 4 -3 =1 .

 If we were to draw in the construction rectangle, it would extend from x = -1 to x = 5.
 The distance from the center to the right side of the rectangle gives b = 5 - 2 = 3 .

                                          (y - 3)2 (x - 2)2

 The standard equation of this hyperbola is 12 - 32 = 1, or

                                      2

 (y - 3)2 - (x - 2) = 1.

                  9

Example 5
 Put the equation of the hyperbola 9x2 +18x - 4y2 +16 y = 43 in standard form. Find the

 center, vertices, length of the transverse axis, and the equations of the asymptotes.
 Sketch the graph, then check on a graphing utility.

To rewrite the equation, we complete the square for both variables to get

9(x2 + 2x +1)- 4(y2 - 4y + 4)= 43 + 9 -16

9(x +1)2 - 4(y - 2)2 = 36

Dividing by 36 gives the standard form of the equation, (x +1)2 - (y - 2)2 = 1
                                                        4             9

                                         ( x - h)2 ( y - k )2

Comparing to the general standard equation a2 - b2 = 1 we see that

a = 4 = 2 and b = 9 = 3 .

Since the y term is subtracted, the hyperbola opens horizontally.

The center is at (h, k) = (-1, 2).

The vertices are at (h켥, k) or (-3, 2) and (1,2).

The length of the transverse axis is 2(a) = 2(2) = 4 .

Equations of the asymptotes are y - k =  b (x - h) or y - 2 =  3 (x +1) .
                                    a                              2

 To sketch the graph we plot the corners of the construction rectangle at (h켥, k켦) or
 (1, 5), (1, -1), (-3,5), and (-3,-1). The asymptotes are drawn through the diagonals of
 the rectangle and the vertices plotted. Then we sketch in the hyperbola rounded at the
 vertices and approaching the asymptotes.

To check on a graphing utility, we must solve the equation for y.

Since the vertices differ in the y -coordinates, the hyperbola opens vertically with an

                     (y - k )2 (x - h)2

equation of the form a2 - b2 = 1 and asymptote equations of the form

y - k =  a (x - h).

                                                           2

The value of a is the distance from the center to a vertex. The distance from (-2,1) to

(-2,-5) is 6, so a = 6.

While our asymptote is not given in the form y - k =  a (x - h) , notice this equation

                                                                 b

Hyperbola Foci

The location of the foci can play a key role in hyperbola application problems. To find
them, we need to find the length from the center to the foci, c, using the equation
b2 = c2 - a2 . It looks similar to, but is not the same as, the Pythagorean Theorem.

Compare this with the equation to find length c for ellipses, which is b2 = a2 - c2 . If you
remember that for the foci to be inside the ellipse they have to come before the vertices
(c  a) , it's clear why we would calculate a 2 minus c2 . To be inside a hyperbola, the
foci have to go beyond the vertices (c  a) , so we can see for hyperbolas we need c2
minus a 2 , the opposite.

The hyperbola is vertical with an equation of the form a2 - b2 = 1.
The center is at (h, k) = (3, -1). The foci are at (h, k  c).

To find length c we use b2 = c2 - a2 . Substituting gives 5 = c2 - 4 or c = 9 = 3.

The hyperbola has foci (3, -4) and (3, 2).

Example 8
 Find the standard form of the equation for a hyperbola with foci (5, -8) and (-3, -8) and
 vertices (4, -8) and (-2, -8).

Since the vertices differ in the x -coordinates, the hyperbola opens horizontally with an

                     (x - h)2 (y - k )2

equation of the form a2 - b2 = 1.

The center is at the midpoint of the vertices

 x1 + x2 y1 + y2   4 + (- 2) - 8 + (- 8),    = (1,-8) .
     ,         =
2          2  2              2

The value of a is the horizontal length from the center to a vertex, or a = 4 -1 = 3 .

The value of c is the horizontal length from the center to a focus, or = 5 -1 = 4 .

To find length b we use b2 = c2 - a2 . Substituting gives b2 = 16 - 9 = 7 .

LORAN

Before GPS, the Long Range Navigation (LORAN)

system was used to determine a ship's location. Two

radio stations A and B simultaneously sent out a signal to

a ship. The difference in time it took to receive the       A B

signal was computed as a distance locating the ship on

the hyperbola with the A and B radio stations as the foci.                 P

A second pair of radio stations C and D sent

simultaneous signals to the ship and computed its           C D
location on the hyperbola with C and D as the foci. The

point P where the two hyperbolas intersected gave the

location of the ship.

Example 9

 Stations A and B are 150 kilometers apart and send a simultaneous radio signal to the
 ship. The signal from B arrives 0.0003 seconds before the signal from A. If the signal
 travels 300,000 kilometers per second, find the equation of the hyperbola on which the
 ship is positioned.

Stations A and B are at the foci, so the distance from the center to one focus is half the
distance between them, giving c = 1 (150) = 75 km.

                                         2

By letting the center of the hyperbola be at (0,0) and placing the foci at (75,0), the
             x2 y2

equation 2 - 2 = 1 for a hyperbola centered at the origin can be used.
            ab

The difference of the distances of the ship from the two stations is
k = 300,000 km  (0.0003 s) = 90 km . From our derivation of the hyperbola equation we

                s
determined k = 2a, so a = 1 (90) = 45 .

                               2

Substituting a and c into b2 = c2 - a2 yields b2 = 752 - 452 = 3600 .

                                                       x2 y2            x2 y2
The equation of the hyperbola in standard form is 2 -           = 1 or  -                =1.
                                                       45 3600          2025 3600

To determine the position of a ship using LORAN, we would need an equation for the
second hyperbola and would solve for the intersection. We will explore how to do that in
the next section.

Section 9.3 Parabolas and Non-Linear Systems

To listen for signals from space, a radio telescope uses a dish in the
shape of a parabola to focus and collect the signals in the receiver.

While we studied parabolas earlier when we explored quadratics, at the
time we didn't discuss them as a conic section. A parabola is the
shape resulting from when a plane parallel to the side of the cone
intersects the cone6.

Parabola Definition and Vocabulary

A parabola with vertex at the origin can be defined by placing a fixed point at

F(0, p) called the focus, and drawing a line at y = - p , called the directrix. The
parabola is the set of all points Q(x, y) that are an equal distance between the fixed

point and the directrix.

For general parabolas,
The axis of symmetry is the line passing through the foci, perpendicular to the
directrix.
The vertex is the point where the parabola crosses the axis of symmetry.
The distance from the vertex to the focus, p, is the focal length.

Equations for Parabolas with Vertex at the Origin

From the definition above we can find an equation of a parabola. We will find it for a

parabola with vertex at the origin, C(0,0), opening upward with focus at F(0, p) and

directrix at y = - p .

Suppose Q(x, y) is some point on the parabola. The distance from Q to the focus is

d(Q, F ) = (x - 0)2 + (y - p)2 = x2 + (y - p)2

The distance from the point Q to the directrix is the difference of the y-values:
 d = y - (- p) = y + p

From the definition of the parabola, these distances should be equal:

x2 + (y - p)2 = y + p                 Square both sides

x2 + (y - p)2 = (y + p)2              Expand

x2 + y2 - 2 py + p2 = y2 + 2 py + p2  Combine like terms

x2 = 4 py

This is the standard conic form of a parabola that opens up or down (vertical axis of
symmetry), centered at the origin. Note that if we divided by 4p, we would get a more
familiar equation for the parabola, y = x2 . We can recognize this as a transformation of

                                                 4p

the parabola y = x2 , vertically compressed or stretched by 1 .
                                                                         4p

Using a similar process, we could find an equation of a parabola with vertex at the origin
opening left or right. The focus will be at (p,0) and the graph will have a horizontal axis
of symmetry and a vertical directrix. The standard conic form of its equation will be
y2 = 4 px , which we could also write as x = y2 .

                                                        4p

Example 1
 Write the standard conic equation for a parabola with vertex at the origin and focus at
 (0, -2).

 With focus at (0, -2), the axis of symmetry is vertical, so the standard conic equation is
  x2 = 4 py . Since the focus is (0, -2), p = -2.

The standard conic equation for the parabola is x2 = 4(-2) y , or
x2 = -8y
                                          Section 9.3 Parabolas and Non-Linear Systems 619

For parabolas with vertex not at the origin, we can shift these equations, leading to the
equations summarized next.

Equation of a Parabola with Vertex at (h, k) in Standard Conic Form

The standard conic form of an equation of a parabola with vertex at the point (h, k )

depends on whether the axis of symmetry is horizontal or vertical. The table below
gives the standard equation, vertex, axis of symmetry, directrix, focus, and graph for
each.

                                    x                       x

Since you already studied quadratics in some depth earlier, we will primarily explore the
new concepts associated with parabolas, particularly the focus.
620 Chapter 9

Example 2
 Put the equation of the parabola y = 8(x -1)2 + 2 in standard conic form. Find the
 vertex, focus, and axis of symmetry.

From your earlier work with quadratics, you may already be able to identify the vertex

as (1,2), but we'll go ahead and put the parabola in the standard conic form. To do so,

we need to isolate the squared factor.

y = 8(x -1)2 + 2                        Subtract 2 from both sides

y - 2 = 8(x -1)2                        Divide by 8

(y - 2) = (x -1)2

   8

This matches the general form for a vertical parabola, (x - h)2 = 4 p(y - k ), where

4 p = 1 . Solving this tells us p = 1 . The standard conic form of the equation is
8                    32

       2 1

(x -1) = 4 (y - 2).

              32 

The vertex is at (1,2). The axis of symmetry is at x = 1.
The directrix is at y = 2 - 1 = 63 .

The focus is at 1,2 +  = 1,  .
                    32   32 

Example 3
 A parabola has its vertex at (1,5) and focus at (3,5). Find an equation for the parabola.

 Since the vertex and focus lie on the line y = 5, that is our axis of symmetry.

 The vertex (1,5) tells us h = 1 and k = 5.

 Looking at the distance from the vertex to the focus, p = 3 - 1 = 2.

 Substituting these values into the standard conic form of an
 equation for a horizontal parabola gives the equation

 (y - 5)2 = 4(2)(x -1)
 (y - 5)2 = 8(x -1)

 Note this could also be rewritten by solving for x, resulting in

 x = 1 (y - 5)2 +1

1. A parabola has its vertex at (-2,3) and focus at (-2,2). Find an equation for this

    parabola.

Applications of Parabolas

In an earlier section, we learned that ellipses have a special property
that a ray eminating from one focus will be reflected back to the
other focus, the property that enables the whispering chamber to
work. Parabolas also have a special property, that any ray
eminating from the focus will be reflected parallel to the axis of
symmetry. Reflectors in flashlights take advantage of this property
to focus the light from the bulb into a collimated beam. The same
property can be used in reverse, taking parallel rays of sunlight or
radio signals and directing them all to the focus.

Example 4
 A solar cooker is a parabolic dish that reflects the sun's rays to a central point allowing
 you to cook food. If a solar cooker has a parabolic dish 16 inches in diameter and 4
 inches tall, where should the food be placed?

We need to determine the location of the focus, since                    y
that's where the food should be placed. Positioning the                                     4
base of the dish at the origin, the shape from the side
looks like:                                                                         8 x

The standard conic form of an equation for the parabola would be x2 = 4 py . The
parabola passes through (8, 4), so substituting that into the equation, we can solve for p:
82 = 4( p)(4)
p = 82 = 4

     16

The focus is 4 inches above the vertex. This makes for a very convenient design, since
then a grate could be placed on top of the dish to hold the food.

Non-Linear Systems of Equations

In many applications, it is necessary to solve for the intersection of two curves. Many of
the techniques you may have used before to solve systems of linear equations will work
for non-linear equations as well, particularly substitution. You have already solved some
examples of non-linear systems when you found the intersection of a parabola and line
while studying quadratics, and when you found the intersection of a circle and line while
studying circles.

Example 4
 Find the points where the ellipse x2 + y2 = 1 intersects the circle x2 + y2 = 9 .
                                            4 25

To start, we might multiply the ellipse equation by 100 on both sides to clear the
fractions, giving 25x2 + 4y2 =100 .

A common approach for finding intersections is substitution. With these equations,
rather than solving for x or y, it might be easier to solve for x2 or y2 . Solving the circle
equation for x2 gives x2 = 9 - y2 . We can then substitute that expression for x2 into
the ellipse equation.

25x2 + 4y2 = 100                 Substitute x2 = 9 - y2
                                 Distribute
25(9 - y2 )+ 4y2 =100            Combine like terms
                                 Divide by -21
225 - 25 y2 + 4y2 =100
                                 Use the square root to solve
- 21y2 = -125

y2 = 125
      21

y =  125 =  5 5
21               21

We can substitute each of these y values back in to x2 = 9 - y2 to find x

x2 = 9 -  125 2         125 189 125 64
                 =9-    =  -  =

x =  64 =  8

There are four points of intersection:   8 ,  5 5  .

                       Section 9.3 Parabolas and Non-Linear Systems 623

It's worth noting there is a second technique we could have used in the previous example,
called elimination. If we multiplied the circle equation by -4 to get - 4x2 - 4y2 = -36 ,

we can then add it to the ellipse equation, eliminating the variable y.
25x2 + 4y2 = 100

- 4x2 - 4y2 = -36                   Add the left sides, and add the right sides

21x2 = 64                           Solve for x

x =  64 =  8

Example 5
 Find the points where the hyperbola y2 - x2 = 1 intersects the parabola y = 2x2 .
                                                49

We can solve this system of equations by substituting y = 2x2 into the hyperbola

equation.

(2x2)2 - x2 = 1                     Simplify
   49

4x4 - x2 =1                         Simplify, and multiply by 9
 49

9x4 - x2 = 9                        Move the 9 to the left

9x4 - x2 -9 = 0

While this looks challenging to solve, we can think of it as a "quadratic in disguise,"
since x4 = (x2 )2 . Letting u = x2 , the equation becomes

9u2 - u - 9 = 0                     Solve using the quadratic formula

u = - (-1)  (-1)2-4(9)(-9) = 1 325  Solve for x
                 2(9)  18

x2 = 1 325                          But 1- 325  0 , so
          18

x =  1+ 325                         This leads to two real solutions

Solving for the intersection of two hyperbolas allows us to utilize
the LORAN navigation approach described in the last section.

In our example, stations A and B are 150 kilometers apart and          A B

send a simultaneous radio signal to the ship. The signal from B

arrives 0.0003 seconds before the signal from A. We found the                              P

equation of the hyperbola in standard form would be

 x2 - y2 =1                                                          C D

Example 6
 Continuing the situation from the last section, suppose stations C and D are located 200
 km due south of stations A and B and 100 km apart. The signal from D arrives 0.0001
 seconds before the signal from C, leading to the equation x2 - ( y + 200)2 = 1. Find
                                                                          225 2275
 the position of the ship.

To solve for the position of the boat, we need to find where the hyperbolas intersect.

This means solving the system of equations. To do this, we could start by solving both

equations for x2 . With the first equation from the previous example,

 x2 - y2 =1                Move the y term to the right
2025 3600

x2 =1+ y2                  Multiply both sides by 2025
2025  3600

x2 = 2025 + 2025 y2        Simplify
                3600

x2 = 2025 + 9 y2
               16

With the second equation, we repeat the same process

x2 - ( y + 200)2 = 1       Move the y term to the right and multiply by 225
225 2275

x2 = 225 + 225( y + 200)2  Simplify
                   2275

x2 = 225 + 9( y + 200)2
                   91
                                  Section 9.3 Parabolas and Non-Linear Systems 625

Now set these two expressions for x2 equal to each other and solve.

2025 + 9 y2 = 225 + 9( y + 200)2           Subtract 225 from both sides

We can find the associated x values by substituting these y-values into either hyperbola
equation. When y  123.11,

                    16
x  102.71

When y  -37.78km,
x2  2025 + 9(-37.78)2

                    16
x  53.18

This provides 4 possible locations for the ship. Two can be immediately discarded, as
they're on land. Navigators would use other navigational techniques to decide between
the two remaining locations.

Section 9.4 Conics in Polar Coordinates

In the preceding sections, we defined each conic in a different way, but each involved the
distance between a point on the curve and the focus. In the previous section, the parabola
was defined using the focus and a line called the directrix. It turns out that all conic
sections (circles, ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas) can be defined using a single
relationship.

Conic Sections General Definition

A conic section can be defined by placing a fixed point at the origin, F(0,0), called

the focus, and drawing a line L called the directrix at x =  p or y =  p . The conic

section is the set of all points Q(x, y) for which the ratio of the distance from Q to F

to the distance from Q to the directrix is some positive constant e, called the

eccentricity. In other words, d(Q, F ) = e .

                                      d (Q, L)

           y               Q                                     y        x

             F                      x                         Q      L: x=p
L: y = -p
                                                                  F

Warning: the eccentricity, e, is not the Euler constant e  2.71828 we studied with exponentials

The Polar Form of a Conic

To create a general equation for a conic section using the definition above, we will use

polar coordinates. Represent Q(x, y) in polar coordinates so (x, y) = (r cos(),rsin()).

For now, we'll focus on the case of a horizontal directrix at y = -p , as in the picture

above on the left.

The distance from the focus to the point Q in polar is just r.

The distance from the point Q to the directrix y = -p is r sin( ) - (- p) = p + r sin( )

The ratio of these should be the constant eccentricity e, so

d(Q, F ) = e               Substituting in the expressions for the distances,

d (Q, L)

     r =e
p + r sin( )
                                    Section 9.4 Conics in Polar Coordinates 631

To have a standard polar equation, we need to solve for r. Start by clearing the fraction.

r = e(p + r sin())                  Distribute

r = ep + er sin( )                  Move terms with r to the left

r - er sin( ) = ep                  Factor the r

r(1- esin()) = ep                   Divide

r = ep
    1- esin( )

We could repeat the same approach for a directrix at y = p and for vertical directrices to
obtain the polar equations below.

Polar Equation for a Conic Section

A conic section with a focus at the origin, eccentricity e, and directrix at x =  p or
y =  p will have polar equation:

r = ep              when the directrix is y =  p
    1 esin( )

r = ep              when the directrix is x =  p
    1 e cos( )

Example 1
 Write the polar equation for a conic section with eccentricity 3 and directrix at x = 2 .

 We are given e = 3 and p = 2. Since the directrix is vertical and at a positive x value, we
 use the equation involving cos with the positive sign.

  r = (3)(2) = 6
      1+ 3cos( ) 1+ 3cos( )

 hyperbola.

Relating the Polar Equation to the Shape

It was probably not obvious to you that the polar equation in the last example would give
the graph of a hyperbola. To explore the relationship between the polar equation and the
shape, we will try to convert the polar equation into a Cartesian one. For simplicity, we
will consider the case where the directrix is x =1.

r= e                         Multiply by the denominator
    1+ e cos( )
                             Rewrite cos( ) = x
r(1+ ecos()) = e                                  r

  x                          Distribute
r1+ e  = e
  r                          Isolate r
r + ex = e                   Square both sides
r = e - ex                   Rewrite r2 = x2 + y2 and expand
                             Move variable terms to the left
r2 =(e - ex)2                Combine like terms

x2 + y2 =e2-2e2x + e2x2
x2 + 2e2x - e2x2 + y2 =e2
x2 (1- e2 ) + 2e2x + y2 =e2

We could continue, by completing the square with the x terms, to eventually rewrite this
                              (1- e2 )2  e2 2 1- e2  2

in the standard form as  2  x - 2  +  2  y = 1 , but happily there's no
                              e  1- e   e 

need for us to do that.

In the equation x2 (1- e2 ) + 2e2x + y2 =e2 , we can see that:
When e < 1, the coefficients of both x2 and y2 are positive, resulting in ellipse.
When e > 1, the coefficient of x2 is negative while the coefficient of y2 is positive,
resulting in a hyperbola.
When e = 1, the x2 will drop out of the equation, resulting in a parabola.

Relation Between the Polar Equation of a Conic and its Shape
For a conic section with a focus at the origin, eccentricity e, and directrix at x =  p
or y =  p ,

when 0 < e < 1, the graph is an ellipse
when e = 1, the graph is a parabola
when e > 1, the graph is a hyperbola
                                                   Section 9.4 Conics in Polar Coordinates 633

Taking a more intuitive approach, notice that if e < 1, the denominator

1+ e cos( ) will always be positive and so r will always be positive.

This means that the radial distance r is defined and finite for every
                        

value of , including , with no breaks. The only conic with this
                         2

characteristic is an ellipse.

If e = 1, the denominator will be positive for all values of , except
- where the denominator is 0 and r is undefined. This fits with a
parabola, which has a point at every angle except at the angle pointing
along the axis of symmetry away from the vertex.

If e > 1, then the denominator will be zero at two angles other           =          = 5
than   , and r will be negative for a set of  values. This                    4           4

division of positive and negative radius values would result in
two distinct branches of the graph, fitting with a hyperbola.

Example 2

For each of the following conics with focus at the origin, identify the shape, the

directrix, and the eccentricity.

a. r = 8            b. r = 6              c. r = 8
        1- 2sin( )          3 - 2 cos( )          5 + 5sin( )

a. This equation is already in standard form r = ep                 for a conic with horizontal
                                                         1 esin( )

directrix at y = -p .

The eccentricity is the coefficient of sin( ) , so e = 2.

Since e = 2 > 1, the shape will be a hyperbola.

Looking at the numerator, ep = 8, and substituting e = 2 gives p = 4. The directrix is
y = -4 .
634 Chapter 9

b. This equation is not in standard form, since the constant in the denominator is not 1.

To put it into standard form, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 1/3.

               1    1
                    6

                    (3 - 2 cos( )) 
               3           3 3

This is the standard form for a conic with vertical directrix x = -p . The eccentricity is

the coefficient on cos( ) , so e = 2 .
                                       3

Since 0 < e < 1, the shape is an ellipse.

Looking at the numerator, ep = 2, so 2 p = 2 , giving p = 3. The directrix is x = -3 .
                                            3

c. This equation is also not in standard form. Multiplying the numerator and

denominator by 1/5 will put it in standard form.

               1    1                    8

                    (5 + 5sin( )) 
               5        5

This is the standard form for a conic with horizontal directrix at y = p .

The eccentricity is the coefficient on sin( ) , so e = 1. The shape will be a parabola.

Looking at the numerator, ep = 8 . Since e = 1, p = 8 . The directrix is y = 8 .
                        5                             5                                5

Notice that since the directrix is above the focus at the origin, the parabola will open
downward.

Graphing Conics from the Polar Form

Identifying additional features of a conic in polar form can be challenging, which makes
graphing without technology likewise challenging. We can utilize our understanding of
the conic shapes from earlier sections to aid us.
                         Section 9.4 Conics in Polar Coordinates 635

Example 3
 Sketch a graph of r = 3 and write its Cartesian equation.
                           1- 0.5sin( )

This is in standard form, and we can identify that e = 0.5 , so the shape is an ellipse.
From the numerator, ep = 3, so 0.5 p = 3 , giving p = 6. The directrix is y = -6 .

To sketch a graph, we can start by evaluating the function at a few convenient  values,
and finding the corresponding Cartesian coordinates.

             1- 0.5sin  
                         2

Plotting these points and remembering the origin is one of the
foci gives an idea of the shape, which we could sketch in. To
get a better understanding of the shape, we could use these
features to find more.

The vertices are at (0, -2) and (0, 6), so the center must be

          -2+6
halfway between, at  0,   = (0, 2). Since the vertices are
          2

a distance a from the center, a = 6 - 2 = 4.

One focus is at (0, 0), a distance of 2 from the center, so c = 2, and the other focus must
be 2 above the center, at (0, 4).

We can now solve for b: b2 = a2 - c2 , so b2 = 42 - 22 = 10 , hence b =  10 . The

minor axis endpoints would be at (- 10 ,2) and ( 10,2).

We can now use the center, a, and b to write the Cartesian equation for this curve:

3. The eccentricity is e = 2, so the graph of the equation is a hyperbola. The directrix is

x = 3. Since the directrix is a vertical line and the focus is at the origin, the hyperbola

is horizontal.

Plotting those points, we can connect the three on the left
with a smooth curve to form one branch of the hyperbola,
and the other branch will be a mirror image passing through
the last point.

The vertices are at (2,0) and (6,0).

The center of the hyperbola would be at the midpoint of the
vertices, at (4,0).
The vertices are a distance a = 2 from the center.
The focus at the origin is a distance c = 4 from the center.

Solving for b, b2 = 42 - 22 = 12 . b =  12 = 2 3 .

The asymptotes would be y =  3(x - 4).

The Cartesian equation of the hyperbola would be:

21. At the beginning of the chapter, we defined an ellipse as the set of all points Q for
    which the sum of the distance from each focus to Q is constant. Mathematically,
Section 9.4 Conics in Polar Coordinates 639

d(Q, F1)+ d(Q, F2 ) = k . It is not obvious that this definition and the one provided in

this section involving the directrix are related. In this exercise, we will start with the
definition from this section and attempt to derive the earlier formula from it.

a. Draw an ellipse with foci at (c,0) and (- c,0) , vertices at (a,0) and (- a,0), and

   directrixes at x = p and x = -p . Label the foci F1 and F2 . Label the directrixes

   L1 and L2 . Label some point (x, y) on the ellipse Q.

b. Find formulas for d(Q, L1) and D(Q, L2 ) in terms of x and p.

c. From the definition of a conic in this section, d (Q, F1) = e . Likewise, d(Q, F2 ) = e
d(Q, L1)                                                          d(Q, L2 )

as well. Use these ratios, with your answers from part (b) above, to find formulas

for d(Q, F1) and D(Q, F2 ) in terms of e, x, and p.

d. Show that the sum, d(Q, F1)+ d(Q, F2 ) , is constant. This establishes that the

    definitions are connected.

e. Let Q be a vertex. Find the distances d(Q, F1) and D(Q, F2 ) in terms of a and c.

    Then combine this with your result from part (d) to find a formula for p in terms
    of a and e.

f. Let Q be a vertex. Find the distances D(Q, L2 ) and D(Q, F2 ) in terms of a, p, and c.

   Use the relationship d(Q, F2 ) = e , along with your result from part (e), to find a
                      d(Q, L2 )

    formula for e in terms of a and c.

22. When we first looked at hyperbolas, we defined them as the set of all points Q for
    which the absolute value of the difference of the distances to two fixed points is

   constant. Mathematically, d (Q, F1 )- d (Q, F2 ) = k . Use a similar approach to the

    one in the last exercise to obtain this formula from the definition given in this section.
    Find a formula for e in terms of a and c.

79. The center is at (0,0). Since a > b, the ellipse is horizontal. Let (c,0) be the focus on

the positive x-axis. Let (c, h) be the endpoint in Quadrant 1 of the latus rectum passing

through (c,0).
682

The distance between the focus and latus rectum endpoint can be found by substituting

(c,0) and (c,h) into the distance formula h = ( x1 - x2 )2 + ( y1 - y2 )2 which yields

h = (c - c)2 + (h - 0)2 = h . So h is half the latus rectum distance. Substituting (c,h)

                                                 c2 h2
into the ellipse equation to find h gives 2 + 2 = 1. Solve for h yields
