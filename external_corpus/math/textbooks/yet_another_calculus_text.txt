Preface

I intend this book to be, firstly, a introduction to calculus based on the hy-
perreal number system. In other words, I will use infinitesimal and infinite
numbers freely. Just as most beginning calculus books provide no logical jus-
tification for the real number system, I will provide none for the hyperreals.
The reader interested in questions of foundations should consult books such as
Abraham Robinson's Non-standard Analysis or Robert Goldblatt's Lectures on
the Hyperreals.

    Secondly, I have aimed the text primarily at readers who already have some
familiarity with calculus. Although the book does not explicitly assume any
prerequisites beyond basic algebra and trigonometry, in practice the pace is
too fast for most of those without some acquaintance with the basic notions of
calculus.

1.1 The arrow paradox

In his famous arrow paradox, Zeno contends that an arrow cannot move since
at every instant of time it is at rest. There are at least two logical problems
hidden in this claim.

1.1.1 Zero divided by zero

In one interpretation, Zeno seems to be saying that, since at every instant of

time the arrow has a definite position, and hence does not travel any distance

during that instant of time, the velocity of the arrow is 0. The question is, if an

object travels a distance 0 in time of duration 0, is the velocity of the object 0?

That is, is

             0                                        (1.1.1)
               = 0?

             0

    To answer this question, we need to examine the meaning of dividing one
number by another. If a and b are real numbers, with b = 0, then

             a                                        (1.1.2)
               =c

             b

means that

             a = b × c.                               (1.1.3)

In particular, for any real number b = 0,

             0                                        (1.1.4)
               =0

             b

since b × 0 = 0. Note that if a = 0, then             (1.1.5)

                                                   a
                                                   0

                            1
2                                                     CHAPTER 1. DERIVATIVES

is undefined since there does not exist a real number c for which 0 × c is equal

to a. We say that division of a non-zero number by zero is meaningless. On the

other hand,                                           (1.1.6)
                                                   0

                                                   0

is undefined because 0 × c = 0 for all real numbers c. For this reason, we say
that division of zero by zero is indeterminate.

    The first logical problem exposed by Zeno's arrow paradox is the problem
of giving determinate meaning to ratios of quantities with zero magnitude. We
shall see that infinitesimals give us one way of giving definite meanings to ratios
of quantities with zero magnitudes, and these ratios will provide the basis for
what we call the differential calculus.

1.1.2 Adding up zeroes

Another possible interpretation of the arrow paradox is that if at every instant
of time the arrow moves no distance, then the total distance traveled by the
arrow is equal to 0 added to itself a large, or even infinite, number of times.
Now if n is any positive integer, then, of course,

   n × 0 = 0.                                         (1.1.7)

That is, zero added to itself a finite number of times is zero. However, if an
interval of time is composed of an infinite number of instants, then we are asking
for the product of infinity and zero, that is,

    × 0.                                              (1.1.8)

One might at first think this result should also be zero; however, more careful
reasoning is needed.

    Note that an interval of time, say the interval [0, 1], is composed of an infinity
of instants of no duration. Hence, in this case, the product of infinity and 0
must be 1, the length of the interval. However, the same reasoning applied to
the interval [0, 2] would lead us to think that infinity times 0 is 2. Indeed, as
with the problem of zero divided by 0, infinity times 0 is indeterminate.

    Thus the second logical problem exposed by Zeno's arrow paradox is the
problem of giving determinate meaning to infinite sums of zero magnitudes, or,
in the simplest cases, to products of infinitesimal and infinite numbers.

    Since division is the inverse operation of multiplication we should expect a
close connection between these questions. This is in fact the case, as we shall
see when we discuss the fundamental theorem of calculus.

1.2 Rates of change

Suppose x(t) gives the position, at some time t, of an object (such as Zeno's
arrow) moving along a straight line. The problem we face is that of giving a
1.2. RATES OF CHANGE                                              3

determinate meaning to the idea of the velocity of the object at a specific instant

of time. We first note that we face no logical difficulties in defining an average

velocity over an interval of time of non-zero length. That is, if a < b, then the

object travels a distance

                           x = x(b) - x(a)                        (1.2.1)

from time t = a to time t = b, an interval of time of length t = b - a, and,
consequently, the average velocity of the object over this interval of time is

                           v[a,b] =  x(b) - x(a) x
                                            =.                    (1.2.2)
                                       b-a     t

Example 1.2.1. Suppose an object, such as a lead ball, is dropped from a
height of 100 meters. Ignoring air resistance, the height of the ball above the
earth after t seconds is given by

                           x(t) = 100 - 4.9t2 meters,

a result first discovered by Galileo. Hence, for example, from time t = 0 to time
t = 2 we have

        x = x(2) - x(0) = (100 - (4.9)(4)) - 100 = -19.6 meters,

                           t = 2 - 0 = 2 seconds,

and so              19.6
        v[0,2] = - 2 = -9.8 meters/second.

For another example, from time t = 1 to time t = 4 we have

        x = x(4) - x(1) = 21.6 - 95.1 = -73.5,

                           t = 4 - 1 = 3 seconds,

and so              73.5
        v[1,4] = - 3 = -24.5 meters/second.

Note that both of these average velocities are negative because we have taken
the positive direction to be upward from the surface of the earth.

Exercise 1.2.1. Suppose a lead ball is dropped into a well. Ignoring air resis-
tance, the ball will have fallen a distance x(t) = 16t2 feet after t seconds. Find
the average velocity of the ball over the intervals (a) [0, 2], (b) [1, 3], and (c)
[1, 1.5].

Letting t = b - a, we may rewrite (1.2.2) in the form

                           v[a,a+t] =  x(a + t) - x(a)            (1.2.3)
                                                         .
                                            t
4  CHAPTER 1. DERIVATIVES

Using (1.2.3), there are two approaches to generalizing the notion of average
velocity over an interval to that of velocity at an instant. The most common
approach, at least since the middle of the 19th century, is to consider the effect
on v[a,a+t] as t diminishes in magnitude and defining the velocity at time
t = a to be the limiting value of these average velocities. The approach we
will take in this text is to consider what happens when we take a and b to be,
although not equal, immeasurably close to one another.

Example 1.2.2. If we have, as in the previous example,

                                   x(t) = 100 - 4.9t2 meters,

then from time t = 1 to time t = 1 + t we would have

                              x = x(1 + t) - x(1)
                                   = (100 - 4.9(1 + t)2) - 95.1
                                   = 4.9 - 4.9(1 + 2t + (t)2)
                                   = -9.8t - 4.9(t)2 meters.

Hence the average velocity over the interval [1, 1 + t] is

                                        x
                         v[1,1+t] = t

                                        -9.8t - 4.9(t)2
                                     =

                                                   t
                                     = -9.8 - 4.9t meters/second.

Note that if, for example, t = 3, then we find

           v[1,4] = -9.8 - (4.9)(3) = -9.8 - 14.7 = -24.5 meters/second,

in agreement with our previous calculations.
    Now suppose that the starting time a = 1 and the ending time b are different,

but the difference is so small that it cannot be measured by any real number.
In this case, we call dt = b - a an infinitesimal . Similar to our computations
above, we have

                   dx = x(1 + dt) - x(1) = -9.8dt - 4.9(dt)2 meters,

the distance traveled by the object from time t = 1 to time t = 1 + dt, and

                                     dx
                      v[1,1+dt] = dt = -9.8 - 4.9dt meters/second,
the average velocity of the object over the interval [1, 1 + dt]. However, since dt
is infinitesimal, so is 4.9dt. Hence v[1,1+dt] is immeasurably close to -9.8 meters
per second. Moreover, this is true no matter what the particular value of dt.
Hence we should take the instantaneous velocity of the object at time t = 1 to
be

                                 v(1) = -9.8 meters/second.
1.2. RATES OF CHANGE                              5

Exercise 1.2.2. As in the previous exercise, suppose a lead ball has fallen
x(t) = 16t2 feet in t seconds. Find the average velocity of the ball over the
interval [1, 1 + t] and use this result to obtain the answers to parts (b) and (c)
of the previous exercise.

Exercise 1.2.3. Find the average velocity of the ball in the previous exercise
over the interval [1, 1 + dt], where dt is infinitesimal, and use the result to find
the instantaneous velocity of the ball at time t = 1.

Example 1.2.3. To find the velocity of the object of the previous examples at
time t = 3, we compute

                               dx = x(3 + dt) - x(3)
                                   = (100 - 4.9(3 + dt)2 - 55.9
                                   = 44.1 - 4.9(9 + 6dt + (dt2))
                                   = -29.4dt - 4.9(dt)2 meters,

from which we obtain

                             dx
                                 = -29.4 - 4.9dt meters/second.

                             dt

As above, we disregard the immeasurable -4.9dt to obtain the velocity of the
object at time t = 3:

                                 v(3) = -29.4meters/second.

Exercise 1.2.4. Find the velocity of the ball in the previous exercise at time
t = 2.

    In general, if x(t) gives the position, at time t, of an object moving along a
straight line, then we define the velocity of the object at a time t to be the real
number which is infinitesimally close to

                      x(t + dt) - x(t)            (1.2.4)
                                          ,

                              dt

provided there is exactly one such number for any value of the nonzero infinites-
imal dt.

Example 1.2.4. For our previous example, we find

dx = x(t + dt) - x(t)
    = (100 - 4.9(t + dt)2) - (100 - 4.9t2)
    = -4.9(t + 2tdt + (dt)2) - 4.9t2
    = -9.8tdt - 4.9(dt)2 meters
    = (-9.8t - 4.9dt)dt.
6                                               CHAPTER 1. DERIVATIVES

Hence              dx
                       = -9.8t - 4.9dt meters/second,

                   dt

and so the velocity of the object at time t is

                         v(t) = -9.8t meters/second.

In particular,

                         v(1) = -9.8 meters/second

and
                          v(3) = -9.8(3) = -29.4 meters/second,

as previously computed.

Exercise 1.2.5. Find the velocity of the ball in the previous exercise at time
t. Use your result to verify your previous answers for v(1) and v(2).

     Even more generally, we should recognize that velocity is but a particular

example of a rate of change, namely, the rate of change of the position of an

object with respect to time. In general, given any quantity y as a function of

another quantity x, say y = f (x) for some function f , we may ask about the

rate of change of y with respect to x. If x changes from x = a to x = b and we

let

                                x = b - a                        (1.2.5)

and

                   y = f (b) - f (a) = f (a + x) - f (x),        (1.2.6)

then                         y f (b) - f (a)

                             x  =  b-a                           (1.2.7)

is the average rate of change of y with respect to x; if dx is a nonzero infinites-

imal, then the real number which is infinitesimally close to

                         dy f (x + dx) - f (x)                   (1.2.8)
                             =
                         dx        dx

is the instantaneous rate of change, or, simply, rate of change, of y with respect
to x at x = a. In subsequent sections we will look at this quantity in more
detail, but will consider one more example before delving into technicalities.

Example 1.2.5. Suppose a spherical shaped balloon is being filled with water.

If r is the radius of the balloon in centimeters and V is the volume of the balloon,

then
                                    V = 4 r3 centimeters3.
                                           3

Since a cubic centimeter of water has a mass of 1 gram, the mass of the water

in the balloon is        M = 4 r3 grams.
                                3
1.3. THE HYPERREALS                        7

To find the rate of change of the mass of the balloon with respect to the radius
of the balloon, we first compute

dM = 4 (r + dr)3 - 4 r3
3                    3

= 4 ((r3 + 3r2dr + 3r(dr)2 + (dr)3) - r3)
   3

= 4 (3r2 + 3rdr + (dr)2)dr grams,
   3

from which it follows that

                   dM = 4 (3r2 + 3rdr + (dr)2) grams/centimeter.
                    dr 3

Since both 3rdr and (dr)2 are infinitesimal, the rate of change of mass of the
balloon with respect to the radius of the balloon is

                              4 (3r2) = 4r2 gams/centimeer.
                              3

For example, when the balloon has a radius of 10 centimeters, the mass of the
water in the balloon is increasing at a rate of

                             4(10)2 = 400 grams/centimeter.

It may not be surprising that this is also the surface area of the balloon at that
instant.

Exercise 1.2.6. Show that if A is the area of a circle with radius r, then
dA dr = 2r.

1.3 The hyperreals

We will let R denote the set of all real numbers. Intuitively, and historically, we
think of these as the numbers sufficient to measure geometric quantities. For
example, the set of all rational numbers, that is, numbers expressible as the
ratios of integers, is not sufficient for this purpose since, for example, the length
of the diagonal of a square with sides of length 1 is the irrational number 2.
There are numerous technical methods for defining and constructing the real
numbers, but, for the purposes of this text, it is sufficient to think of them as
the set of all numbers expressible as infinite decimals, repeating if the number
is rational and non-repeating otherwise.

    A positive infinitesimal is any number with the property that > 0 and
  < r for any positive real number r. The set of infinitesimals consists of the
positive infinitesimals along with their additive inverses and zero. Intuitively,
8                                   CHAPTER 1. DERIVATIVES

these are the numbers which, except for 0, correspond to quantities which are
too small to measure even theoretically. Again, there are technical ways to make
the definition and constrution of infinitesimals explicit, but they lie beyond the
scope of this text.

    The multiplicative inverse of a nonzero infinitesimal is an infinite number.
That is, for any infinitesimal = 0, the number

                                                      1
                                               N=

is an infinite number.

   The finite hyperreal numbers are numbers of the form r + , where r is a real

number and is an infinitesimal. The hyperreal numbers, which we denote R,
consist of the finite hyperreal numbers along with all infinite numbers.

   For any finite hyperreal number a, there exists a unique real number r for

which a = r + for some infinitesimal . In this case, we call r the shadow of a

and write

                        r = sh(a).               (1.3.1)

Alternatively, we may call sh(a) the standard part of a.
    We will write a b to indicate that a - b is an infinitesimal, that is, that a

and b are infinitesimally close. In particular, for any finite hyperreal number a,
a sh(a).

    It is important to note that

   · if and  are infinitesimals, then so is + ,

   · if is an infinitesimal and a is a finite hyperreal number, then a is an
      infinitesimal, and

   · if is a nonzero infinitesimal and a is a hyperreal number with sh(a) = 0
      (that is, a is not an infinitesimal), then a is infinite.

These are in agreement with our intuition that a finite sum of infinitely small
numbers is still infinitely small and that an infinitely small nonzero number will
divide into any noninfinitesimal quantity an infinite number of times.

Exercise 1.3.1. Show that sh(a + b) = sh(a) + sh(b) and sh(ab) = sh(a)sh(b),
where a and b are any hyperreal numbers.

Exercise 1.3.2. Suppose a is a hyperreal number with sh(a) = 0. Show that
sh 1a = 1 sh(a) .

1.4 Continuous functions

As (1.2.8) indicates, we would like to define the rate of change of a function
y = f (x) with respect to x as the shadow of the ratio of two quantities, dy =
f (x + dx) - f (x) and dx, with the latter being a nonzero infinitesimal. From
1.4. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS                                               9

the discussion of the previous section, it follows that we can do this if and only
if the numerator dy is also an infinitesimal.

Definition 1.4.1. We say a function f is continuous at a real number c if for

every infinitesimal ,

                       f (c + ) f (c)                                   (1.4.1)

    Note that f (c + ) f (c) is equivalent to f (c + ) - f (c) 0, that is,
f (c + ) - f (c) is an infinitesimal. In other words, a function f is continuous
at a real number c if an infinitesimal change in the value of c results in an
infinitesimal change in the value of f .

Example 1.4.1. If f (x) = x2, then, for example, for any infinitesimal ,

                      f (3 + ) = (3 + )2 = 9 + 6 + 2 9 = f (3).

Hence f is continuous at x = 3. More generally, for any real number x,
                   f (x + ) = (x + )2 = x2 + 2x + 2 x2 = f (x),

from which it follows that f is continuous at every real number x.

Exercise 1.4.1. Verify that f (x) = 3x + 4 is continuous at x = 5.
Exercise 1.4.2. Verify that g(t) = t3 is continuous at t = 2.

Given real numbers a and b, we let

(a, b) = {x | x is a real number and a < x < b},                        (1.4.2)

(a, ) = {x | x is a real number and x > a},                             (1.4.3)

(-, b) = {x | x is a real number and x < b},                            (1.4.4)

and                                                                     (1.4.5)
                                          (-, ) = R.

An open interval is any set of one of these forms.

Definition 1.4.2. We say a function f is continuous on an open interval I if
f is continuous at every real number in I.

Example 1.4.2. From our example above, it follows that f (x) = x2 is contin-
uous on (-, ).

Exercise 1.4.3. Verify that f (x) = 3x + 4 is continuous on (-, ).
Exercise 1.4.4. Verify that g(t) = t3 is continuous on (-, ).

         Figure 1.4.1: Graph of the Heaviside function

Example 1.4.3. We call the function

                     0, if t < 0,
         H(t) =

                     1, if t  0,

the Heaviside function (see Figure 1.4.1). If is a positive infinitesimal, then

         H(0 + ) = H( ) = 1 = H(0),

whereas

         H(0 - ) = H(- ) = 0.

Since 0 is not infinitesimally close to 1, it follows that H is not continuous at
0. However, for any positive real number a and any infinitesimal (positive or
negative),

                                     H(a + ) = 1 = H(a),

since a + > 0, and for any negative real number a and any infinitesimal ,

         H(a + ) = 0 = H(a),

since a + < 0. Thus H is continuous on both (0, ) and (-, 0).

    Note that, in the previous example, the Heaviside function satisfies the con-
dition for continuity at 0 for positive infinitesimals but not for negative infinites-
imals. The following definition addresses this situation.

Definition 1.4.3. We say a function f is continuous from the right at a real
number c if for every infinitesimal > 0,

                   f (c + ) f (c).                            (1.4.6)
1.4. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS                                         11

Similarly, we say a function f is continuous from the left at a real number c if
for every infinitesimal > 0,

                 f (c - ) f (c).                                  (1.4.7)

Example 1.4.4. In the previous example, H is continuous from the right at
t = 0, but not from the left.

    Of course, if f is continuous both from the left and the right at c, then f is
continuous at c.

Example 1.4.5. Suppose

                             3x + 5, if x  1,
                 f (x) =

                             10 - 2x, if x > 1.

If is a positive infinitesimal, then

                 f (1 + ) = 3(1 + ) + 5 = 8 + 3 8 = f (1),

so f is continuous from the right at x = 1, and

                 f (1 - ) = 3(1 - ) + 5 = 8 - 3 8 = f (1),

so f is continuous from the left at x = 1 as well. Hence f is continuous at x = 1.

Exercise 1.4.5.  Verify that the function
                                     
                                     0, if t < 0,

                           U (t) = 1, if 0  t  1,
                                        0, if t > 1,

is continuous from the right at t = 0 and continuous from the left at t = 1, but
not continuous at either t = 0 or t = 1. See Figure 1.4.2.

Given real numbers a and b, we let

[a, b] = {x | x is a real number and a  x  b},                    (1.4.8)

                      [a, ) = {x | x is a real number and x  a},   (1.4.9)
and                                                               (1.4.10)

                     (-, b] = {x | x is a real number and x  b}.
A closed interval is any set of one of these forms.

Definition 1.4.4. If a and b are real numbers, we say a function f is contin-
uous on the closed interval [a, b] if f is continuous on the open interval (a, b),
continuous from the right at a, and continuous from the left at b. We say f is
continuous on the closed interval [a, ) if f is continuous on the open interval
(a, ) and continuous from the right at a. We say f is continuous on the closed
interval (-, b] if f is continuous on (-, b) and continuous from the left at b.

1.5 Properties of continuous functions

Suppose f is continuous at the real number c and k is any fixed real number. If
we let h(x) = kg(x), then, for any infinitesimal ,

    h(c + ) - h(c) = kf (c + ) - kf (c) = k(f (c + ) - f (c))     (1.5.1)

is an infinitesimal since, by assumption, f (c+ )-f (c) is an infinitesimal. Hence
h(c + ) h(c).

Theorem 1.5.1. If f is continuous at c and k is any fixed real number, then
the function h(x) = kf (x) is also continuous at c.

Example 1.5.1. We have seen that f (x) = x2 is continuous on (-, ). It
now follows that, for example, g(x) = 5x2 is also continuous on (-, ).

    Suppose that both f and g are continuous at the real number c and we let
s(x) = f (x) + g(x). If is any infinitesimal, then

        s(c + ) = f (c + ) + g(c + ) f (c) + g(c) = s(c),         (1.5.2)

and so s is also continuous at c.
1.5. PROPERTIES OF CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS                                   13

Theorem 1.5.2. If f and g are both continuous at c, then the function

                  s(x) = f (x) + g(x)

is also continuous at c.
Example 1.5.2. Since

                           (x + )3 = x3 + 3x2 + 3x 2 + 3 x3

for any real number x and any infinitesimal , it follows that g(x) = x3 is
continuous on (-, ). From the previous theorems, it then follows that

                                        h(x) = 5x2 + 3x3

is continuous on (-, ).

    Again, suppose f and g are both continuous at c and let p(x) = f (x)g(x).
Then, for any infinitesimal ,

p(c + )-s(c) = f (c + )g(c + ) - f (c)g(c)                                (1.5.3)
             = f (c + )g(c + ) - f (c)g(c + ) + f (c)g(c + ) - f (c)g(c)
             = g(c + )(f (c + ) - f (c)) + f (c)(g(c + ) - g(c)),

which is infinitesimal since both f (c + ) - f (c) and g(c + ) - g(c) are. Hence
p is continuous at c.

Theorem 1.5.3. If f and g are both continuous at c, then the function

                     p(x) = f (x)g(x)

is also continuous at c.

    Finally, suppose f and g are continuous at c and g(c) = 0. Let q(x) = g(x) f(x) .
Then, for any infinitesimal ,

                  f (c + ) f (c)
q(c + ) - q(c) =  -
                  g(c + ) g(c)

   f (c + )g(c) - f (c)g(c + )
=

             g(c + )g(c)

   f (c + )g(c) - f (c)g(c) + f (c)g(c) - f (c)g(c + )
=

                           g(c + )g(c)

=                 g(c)(f (c + ) - f (c)) - f (c)(g(c + ) - g(c))  ,       (1.5.4)

                                  g(c + )g(c)

which is infinitesimal since both f (c + ) - f (c) and g(c + ) - g(c) are in-
finitesimals, and g(c)g(c + ) is not an infinitesimal. Hence q is continuous at
c.
14                                                           CHAPTER 1. DERIVATIVES

Theorem 1.5.4. If f and g are both continuous at c and g(c) = 0, then the
function

                                                      f (x)
                                            q(x) =

                                                      g(x)

is continuous at c.

Exercise 1.5.1. Explain why
                                                     3x + 4

                                          f (x) = x2 + 1
is continuous on (-, ).

1.5.1 Polynomials and rational functions

It is now possible to identify two important classes of continuous functions.
First, every constant function is continuous: indeed, if f (x) = k for all real
values x, and k is any real constant, then for any infinitesimal ,

                         f (x + ) = k = f (x).                (1.5.5)

Next, the function f (x) = x is continuous for all real x since, for any infinitesimal

,

    f (x + ) = x + x = f (x).                                 (1.5.6)

Since the product of continuous functions is continuous, it now follows that, for
any nonnegative integer n, g(x) = xn is continuous on (-, ) since it is a
constant function if n = 0 and a product of f (x) = x by itself n times otherwise.

    From this it follows (since constant multiples of continuous functions are
again continuous) that all monomials, that is, functions of the form f (x) = axn,
where a is a fixed real constant and n is a nonnegative integer, are continuous.

    Now a polynomial is a function of the form

    P (x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · + anxn,                   (1.5.7)

where a0, a1, . . . , an are real constants and n is a nonnegative integer. That
is, a polynomial is a sum of monomials. Since sums of continuous functions are
continuous, we now have the following fundamental result.

Theorem 1.5.5. If P is a polynomial, then P is continuous on (, ).

Example 1.5.3. The function
                               f (x) = 32 + 14x5 - 6x7 + x14

is continuous on (-, ).
1.5. PROPERTIES OF CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS                             15

A rational function is a ratio of polynomials. That is, if P (x) and Q(x) are

polynomials, then

                             P (x)                                  (1.5.8)
                   R(x) =

                             Q(x)

is a rational function. Since ratios of continuous functions are continuous, we
have the following.

Theorem 1.5.6. If R is rational function, then R is continuous at every point
in its domain.

Example 1.5.4. If

                             3x - 4
                   f (x) = x2 - 1 ,

then f is a rational function defined for all real x except x = -1 and x = 1.

Thus f is continuous on the intervals (-, -1), (-1, 1), and (1, ).

Exercise 1.5.2.    Find the intervals on which
is continuous.                                3x2 - 1

                                    f (x) = x3 + 1

1.5.2 Trigonometric functions

Recall that if t is a real number and (a, b) is the point in the plane found by
traversing the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1 a distance |t| from (1, 0), in the counter-
clockwise direction if t  0 and in the clockwise direction otherwise, then

                   a = cos(t)                                        (1.5.9)
                   b = sin(t).                                      (1.5.10)

    Note that for 0 < t < , as in Figure 1.5.1, t is greater than the length
of the line segment from A = (1, 0) to B = (cos(t), sin(t)). Now the segment
from A to B is the hypotenuse of the right triangle with vertices at A, B, and
C = (cos(t), 0). Since the distance from C to A is 1 - cos(t)) and the distance
from B to C is sin(t), it follows from the Pythagorean theorem that

                   t2 > (1 - cos(t))2 + sin2(t)                     (1.5.11)
                      = 1 - 2 cos(t) + cos2(t) + sin2(t)
                      = 2 - 2 cos(t).

A similar diagram reveals the same result for - < t < 0. Moreover, both t2
and 2 - 2 cos(t) are 0 when t = 0, so we have t2  2 - 2 cos(t) for all - < t < .

    Additionally, 0  2 - 2 cos(t)  4 for all t (since -1  cos(t)  1 for all t),
so certainly t2 > 2 - 2 cos(t) whenever |t| > 2. Hence we have shown that

                   0  2 - 2 cos(t)  t2                              (1.5.12)

Solving for cos(t), we may also write this as
                                                                      (1.5.17)

    In particular, if is an infinitesimal, then

                                  2

implies that

              cos(0 + ) = cos( ) 1 = cos(0).

That is, the function f (t) = cos(t) is continuous at t = 0.
    Moreover, since 0  1 + cos(t)  2 for all t,

              sin2(t) = 1 - cos2(t)

                       = (1 - cos(t))(1 + cos(t))

for any value of t. In particular, for any infinitesimal ,

                            | sin(0 + )| = | sin( )|  ,          (1.5.19)

from which it follows that

                            sin( ) 0 = sin(0).                   (1.5.20)

That is, the function g(t) = sin(t) is continuous at t = 0.
    Using the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine, we see that, for any

real number t and infinitesimal ,

              cos(t + ) = cos(t) cos( ) - sin(t) sin( ) cos(t)   (1.5.21)

and           sin(t + ) = sin(t) cos( ) + cos(t) sin( ) sin(t),  (1.5.22)

since cos( )  1 and sin( ) is an infinitesimal. Hence we have the following
result.

Theorem 1.5.7. The functions f (t) = cos(t) and g(t) = sin(t) are continuous
on (-, ).

    The following theorem now follows from our earlier results about continuous
functions.

Theorem 1.5.8. The following functions are continuous at each point in their
respective domains:

                            tan(t) =  sin(t)  ,                  (1.5.23)
                                                                 (1.5.24)
                                      cos(t)                     (1.5.25)
                                                                 (1.5.26)
                            cot(t) =  cos(t)  ,

                                      sin(t)

                            sec(t) =  1       ,

                                      cos(t)

                            csc(t) =  1       .

                                      sin(t)

    With a little more geometry, we may improve upon the inequalities in
(1.5.13) and (1.5.18). Consider an angle 0 < t < 2 , let A = (1, 0) and
B = (cos(t), sin(t)) as above, and let D be the point of intersection of the
lines tangent to the circle x2 + y2 = 1 at A and B (see Figure 1.5.2). Note

that the triangle with vertices at A, B, and D is isosceles with base of length
   2(1 - cos(t)) (as derived above) and base angles t2 . Moreover, the sum of the

lengths of the two legs exceeds t. Since each leg is of length

                            12 2(1 - cos(t)) ,                   (1.5.27)

                             t < cos 2t .

Moreover, both sides of this inequality are 0 when t = 0 and we could derive
the same inequality for - 2 < t < 0, so we have

                                                2(1 - cos(t))         (1.5.29)

Since and sin( ) have the same sign, it follows that

Given functions f and g, we call the function

the composition of f with g. If g is continuous at a real number c, f is continuous
at g(c), and is an infinitesimal, then

                          f  g(c + ) = f (g(c + )) f (g(c))                       (1.5.40)

                                                    3t2 + 1
                                          g(t) =

                                                    4t - 8
is continuous at all real numbers except t = 2, it follows that

                                 3t2 + 1
                 h(t) = sin

                                 4t - 8

is continuous on the intervals (-, 2) and (2, ).

                          
Note that if f (x) = x and is an infinitesimal, then, for any x = 0,

                               
                f (x + ) - f (x) = x + - x
                                                            
                                            x +          +x
                 = ( x + - x)
                                              x+            
                                                         +x

                 =  x+ -x
                               
                    x+ + x

                 =             ,
                    x+ + x

which is infinitesimal. Hence f is continuous on (0, ). Moreover,if is a
positive infinitesimal, then must be an infinitesimal (since if a = is not
an infinitesimal, then a2 = is not an infinitesimal). Hence

                 f (0 + ) =    0 = f (0).

                                                       
Thus f is continuous at 0, and so f (x) = x is continuous on [0, ).

                                                      
Theorem 1.5.10. The function f (x) = x is continuous on [0, ).

                                                           
Example 1.5.7. It now follows that f (x) = 4x - 2 is continuous everywhere
it is defined, namely, on [2, ).

1.5.4 Consequences of continuity

Continuous functions have two important properties that will play key roles
in our discussions in the rest of the text: the extreme-value property and the
intermediate-value property. Both of these properties rely on technical aspects
of the real numbers which lie beyond the scope of this text, and so we will not
attempt justifications.

    The extreme-value property states that a continuous function on a closed
interval [a, b] attains both a maximum and minimum value.

Theorem 1.5.11. If f is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], then there exists
a real number c in [a, b] for which f (c)  f (x) for all x in [a, b] and a real number
d in [a, b] for which f (d)  f (x) for all x in [a, b].

    The following examples show the necessity of the two conditions of the the-
orem (that is, the function must be continuous and the interval must be closed
in order to ensure the conclusion).

Example 1.5.8. The function f (x) = x2 attains neither a maximum nor a
minimum value on the interval (0, 1). Indeed, given any point a in (0, 1), f (x) >
f (a) whenever a < x < 1 and f (x) < f (a) whenever 0 < x < a. Of course, this
does not contradict the theorem because (0, 1) is not a closed interval. On the
closed interval [0, 1], we have f (1)  f (x) for all x in [0, 1] and f (0)  f (x) for
all x in [0, 1], in agreement with the theorem.

    In this example the extreme values of f occurred at the endpoints of the

interval [-1, 1]. This need not be the case. For example, if g(t) = sin(t), then,

on  the  interval  [0, 2],  g  has  a  minimum  value  of  -1  at  t  =  3   and  a  maximum
                                                                          2
value of 1 at t = 2 .

Example 1.5.9. Let                     if - 1  x < 0 or 0 < x  1,
                                       if x = 0.
                                 1,

                       f (x) = 0,x

See Figure 1.5.5. Then f does not have a maximum value: if a  0, then
f (x) > f (a) for any x > 0, and if a > 0, then f (x) > f (a) whenever 0 < x < a.
Similarly, f has no minimum value: if a  0, then f (x) < f (a) for any x < 0,
and if a < 0, then f (x) < f (a) whenever a < x < 0. The problem this time is
that f is not continuous at x = 0. Indeed, if is an infinitesimal, then f ( ) is
infinite, and, hence, not infinitesimally close to f (0) = 0.

Exercise 1.5.7. Find an example of a continuous function which has both a
minimum value and a maximum value on the open interval (0, 1).

Exercise 1.5.8. Find an example of function which has a minimum value and
a maximum value on the interval [0, 1], but is not continuous on [0, 1].

    Figure 1.5.5: A function with no minimum or maximum value on [-1, 1]

    The intermediate-value property states that a continuous function attains
all values between any two given values of the function.

Theorem 1.5.12. If f is continuous on the interval [a, b] and m is any value
betwen f (a) and f (b), then there exists a real number c in [a, b] for which
f (c) = m.

    The next example shows that a function which is not continuous need not
satisfy the intermediate-value property.

Example 1.5.10. If H is the Heaviside function, then H(-1) = 0 and H(1) =

1, but there does not exist any real number c in [-1, 1] for which H(c) = 12 ,
                     1
even   though  0  <  2  <  1.

1.6 The derivative

We now return to the problem of rates of change. Given y = f (x), for any

infinitesimal dx we let

                                   dy = f (x + dx) - f (x).                                            (1.6.1)

If y is a continuous function of x, then dy is infinitesimal and, if dx = 0, the

ratio                              dy f (x + dx) - f (x)

                                   dx  =                 dx                                            (1.6.2)

is  a  hyperreal  number.      If  dy  is  finite,  then     its  shadow,  if  it  is  the  same       for  all
                                   dx

values of dx, is the rate of change of y with respect to x, which we will call the

derivative of y with respect to x.
24                                                       CHAPTER 1. DERIVATIVES

Definition 1.6.1. Given y = f (x), suppose

                                dy f (x + dx) - f (x)                                     (1.6.3)
                                       =
                                dx                 dx

is finite and has the same shadow for all nonzero infinitesimals dx. Then we call

                                                dy                                        (1.6.4)
                                          sh

                                               dx

the derivative of y with respect to x.

    Note that the quotient in (1.6.3) will be infinite if f (x + dx) - f (x) is not

an infinitesimal. Hence a function which is not continuous at x cannot have a

derivative at x.

    There are numerous ways to denote the derivative of a function y = f (x).

One  is  to  use  dy  to  denote,   depending      on    the  context,  both  the  ratio  of  the
                  dx

infinitesimals dy and dx and the shadow of this ratio, which is the derivative.

Another is to write f (x) for the derivative of the function f . We will use both

of these notations extensively.

Example 1.6.1. If y = x2, then, for any nonzero infinitesimal dx,

         dy = (x + dx)2 - x2 = (x2 + 2xdx + (dx)2) - x2 = (2x + dx)dx.

Hence                               dy
                                        = 2x + dx 2x,

                                    dx

and so the derivative of y with respect to x is

                                          dy
                                              = 2x.

                                          dx

Example 1.6.2. If f (x) = 4x, then, for any nonzero infinitesimal dx,

                  f (x + dx) - f (x) 4(x + dx) - 4x 4dx
                                          =                   = = 4.
                          dx                        dx        dx

Hence f (x) = 4. Note that this implies that f (x) has a constant rate of change:
every change of one unit in x results in a change of 4 units in f (x).

Exercise 1.6.1.       Find  dy  if  y  =  5x - 2.
                            dx

Exercise 1.6.2.       Find  dy  if  y  =  x3.
                            dx

Exercise 1.6.3. Find f (x) if f (x) = 4x2.

    To denote the rate of change of y with respect to x at a particular value of

x, say, when x = a, we write

                                             dy                                           (1.6.5)
                                                      .

                                             dx x=a

If y = f (x), then, of course, this is the same as writing f (a).

Example 1.6.4. If f (x) = x 3 , then for any infinitesimal dx,

                        f (0 + dx) - f (0) = f (dx) = (dx) 3 ,

which is infinitesimal. Hence f is continuous at x = 0. Now if dx = 0, then

                                               2                               1

                               dx = dx = (dx) 31 .

Since this is infinite, f does not have a derivative at x = 0. In particular, this
shows that a function may be continuous at a point, but not differentiable at
that point. See Figure 1.6.1.

                                             2x

For example, the rate of change of y with respect to x when x = 9 is

                                        11
                            f (9) =  = .

                                      29 6

    We will sometimes also write

                                  d                                   (1.6.6)
                                     f (x)

                                  dx

for f (x). With this notation, we could write the result of the previous example

as                                d         1

                            dx       x=  .
                                     2x

Definition 1.6.2. Given a function f , if f (a) exists we say f is differentiable
at a. We say f is differentiable on an open interval (a, b) if f is differentiable at
each point x in (a, b).

Example 1.6.6. The function y = x2 is differentiable on (-, ).
                                                   

Example 1.6.7. The function f (x) = x is differentiable on (0, ). Note that
f is not differentiable at x = 0 since f (0 + dx) = f (dx) is not defined for all
infinitesimals dx.

                                                                                                            2

Example 1.6.8. The function f (x) = x 3 is not differentiable at x = 0.

1.7 Properties of derivatives

We will now develop some properties of derivatives with the aim of facilitating

their calculation for certain general classes of functions.

    To begin, if f (x) = k for all x and some real constant k, then, for any

infinitesimal dx,

                       f (x + dx) - f (x) = k - k = 0.                (1.7.1)

Hence, if dx = 0,                                                     (1.7.2)
                                     f (x + dx) - f (x)
                                                             = 0,
                                               dx

and so f (x) = 0. In other words, the derivative of a constant is 0.

Theorem 1.7.1. For any real constant k,

                                  d                                   (1.7.3)
                                     k = 0.

                                  dx

                         d

1.7.1 Sums and differences

Now suppose u and v are both differentiable functions of x. Then, for any
infinitesimal dx,

          d(u + v) = (u(x + dx) + v(x + dx)) - (u(x) - v(x))            (1.7.4)
                     = (u(x + dx) - u(x)) + (v(x + dx) - v(x))
                     = du + dv.

Hence, if dx = 0,

                   d(u + v) du dv                                       (1.7.5)
                                       = +.
                          dx               dx dx

In other words, the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.

Theorem   1.7.2.   If f and g are both differentiable and s(x) =  f (x) + g(x),
then      1.7.2.                                                          (1.7.6)
                                s (x) = f (x) + g (x).
Example            If y = x2 + x, then, using our results from    the previous
section,

                   dy d 2 d                       1
                   = (x ) + ( x) = 2x +  .
                   dx dx               dx         2x

A similar argument shows that

                   d                       du dv                        (1.7.7)
                          (u - v) = - .
                   dx                      dx dx

Exercise 1.7.1. Find the derivative of y = x2 + 5.
Exercise 1.7.2. Find the derivative of f (x) = x - x2 + 3.

1.7.2 Constant multiples

If c is any real constant and u is a differentiable function of x, then, for any
infinitesimal dx,

      d(cu) = cu(x + dx) - cu(x) = c(u(x + dx) - u(x)) = cdu.           (1.7.8)

Hence, if dx = 0,

                          d(cu) du
                                       =c .                             (1.7.9)
                          dx               dx

In other words, the derivative of a constant times a function is the constant

times the derivative of the function.

Theorem 1.7.3. If c is a real constant, f is differentiable, and g(x) = cf (x),

then

                          g (x) = cf (x).                               (1.7.10)
28                                             CHAPTER 1. DERIVATIVES

Example 1.7.3. If y = 5x2, then
                                dy = 5 d (x2) = 5(2x) = 10x.

Exercise 1.7.4. Find the derivative of f (x) = 4 x + 15.

1.7.3 Products

Again suppose u and v are differentiable functions of x. Note that, in partic-
ular, u and v are continuous, and so both du and dv are infinitesimal for any
infinitesimal dx. Moreover, note that

    u(x + dx) = u(x) + du and v(x + dx) = v(x) + dv.               (1.7.11)

Hence                                                              (1.7.12)

         d(uv) = u(x + dx)v(x + dx) - u(x)v(x)
                 = (u(x) + du)(v(x) + dv) - u(x)v(x)
                 = (u(x)v(x) + u(x)dv + v(x)du + dudv) - u(x)v(x)
                 = udv + vdu + dudv,

and so, if dx = 0,

                    d(uv) dv du       dv         dv du
                        = u + v + du           u +v                (1.7.13)
                    dx  dx dx         dx                           (1.7.14)
                                                 dx dx

Thus we have, for any differentiable functions u and v,

                        d        dv du
                                 (uv) = u + v ,
                        dx       dx dx

which we call the product rule.

Theorem 1.7.4. If f and g are both differentiable and p(x) = f (x)g(x), then

                        p (x) = f (x)g (x) + g(x)f (x).            (1.7.15)

Example 1.7.4. We may use the product rule to find a formula for the deriva-

tive of a positive integer power of x. We first note that if y = x, then, for any

infinitesimal dx,

                        dy = (x + dx) - x = dx,                    (1.7.16)

and so, if dx = 0,               dy dx                             (1.7.17)
Thus we have                         = = 1.                        (1.7.18)

                                 dx dx
                                     d
                                       x = 1,
                                    dx
1.7. PROPERTIES OF DERIVATIVES                             29

as we should expect, since y = x implies that y changes at exactly the same
rate as x.

    Using the product rule, it now follows that

      d x2 = d (x · x) = x d x + x d x = x + x = 2x,       (1.7.19)
      dx  dx                     dx      dx

in agreement with a previous example. Next, we have

          d x3 = x d x2 + x2 d x = 2x2 + x2 = 3x2          (1.7.20)
          dx                 dx      dx                    (1.7.21)

and       d x4 = x d x3 + x3 d x = 3x3 + x3 = 4x3.

          dx                 dx      dx

At this point we might suspect that for any integer n  1,

                                 d xn = nxn-1.             (1.7.22)
                                 dx

This is in fact true, and follows easily from an inductive argument: Suppose we
have shown that for any k < n,

                                 d xk = kxk-1.             (1.7.23)
                                 dx                        (1.7.24)

Then

                         d xn = x d xn-1 + xn-1 d x
                         dx      dx              dx

                             = x((n - 1)xn-2) + xn-1

                             = nxn-1.

We call this result the power rule.

Theorem 1.7.5. For any integer n  1,

                                 d xn = nxn-1.             (1.7.25)
                                 dx

    We shall see eventually, in Theorems 1.7.7, 1.7.10, and 2.7.2, that the power
rule in fact holds for any real number n = 0.

Example 1.7.5. When n = 34, the power rule shows that

                                 d x34 = 34x33.
                                 dx

Example 1.7.6. If f (x) = 14x5, then, combining the power rule with our result

for constant multiples,

                             f (x) = 14(5x4) = 70x4.

Exercise 1.7.7. Find the derivative of y = 3x7 - 3x + 1.

1.7.4 Polynomials

As the previous examples illustrate, we may put together the above results to
easily differentiate any polynomial function. That is, if n  1 and an, an-1,
. . . , a0 are any real constants, then

    d (anxn + an-1xn-1 + · · · + a2x2 + a1x + a0)                           (1.7.26)
    dx

                          = nanxn-1 + (n - 1)an-1xn-2 + · · · + 2a2x + a1.

Example 1.7.8. If p(x) = 4x7 - 13x3 - x2 + 21, then

    p (x) = 28x6 - 39x2 - 2x.

Exercise 1.7.8. Find the derivative of f (x) = 3x5 - 6x4 - 5x2 + 13.

1.7.5 Quotients

If u is a differentiable function of x, u(x) = 0, and dx is an infinitesimal, then

    d     1  =                     1          -  1

          u u(x + dx) u(x)

             =                     1          -  1

                                   u(x) + du u(x)

                u - (u + du)
             =

                  u(u + du)

             =                     -du        .                             (1.7.27)

                                   u(u + du)

Hence, since u + du u, if dx = 0,

                                   du

    d 1 = - dx                                      1 du                    (1.7.28)

Theorem 1.7.6. If f is differentiable, f (x) = 0, and                   (1.7.29)

then                                   f (x)

                           g (x) = - (f (x)2 .                          (1.7.30)

Example 1.7.9. If

                                            1
                                 f (x) = x2 ,

then                             1               2

                           f (x) = - x4 · 2x = - x3 .

    Note that the result of the previous example is the same as we would have
obtained from applying the power rule with n = -2. In fact, we may now show
that the power rule holds in general for negative integer powers: If n < 0 is an
integer, then

      ddx xn = dx x-n d 1 = - x-2n 1 · (-nx-n-1) = nxn-1.               (1.7.31)

Hence we now have our first generalization of the power rule.

Theorem 1.7.7. For any integer n = 0,

                                 d xn = nxn-1.                          (1.7.32)
                                 dx

Example 1.7.10. If

                           f (x) = 3x2 - x7 5 ,

then f (x) = 3x2 - 5x-7, and so

                               f (x) = 6x + 35x-8 = 6x + x8 35 .
    Now suppose u and v are both differentiable functions of x and let

                                                     u
                                               y= .

                                                     v
Then u = vy, so, as we saw above,

      du = vdy + ydv + dvdy = ydv + (v + dv)dy.                         (1.7.33)

Hence, provided v(x) = 0,

                                       u
      dy = du - ydv du - = v dv = vdu - udv .

                              du dv       du dv                           (1.7.35)

                    dx v(v + dv)

                                               v2

This is the quotient rule.

Theorem 1.7.8. If f and g are differentiable, g(x) = 0, and

                                         f (x)                            (1.7.36)
                                q(x) = ,

                                          g(x)

then                            g(x)f (x) - f (x)g (x)

                       q (x) =           (g(x))2 .                        (1.7.37)

    One consequence of the quotient rule is that, since we already know how to
differentiate polynomials, we may now differentiate any rational function easily.

Example 1.7.11. If                    3x2 - 6x + 4
then                        f (x) = x2 + 1 ,

      f (x) =              (x2 + 1)(6x - 6) - (3x2 - 6x + 4)(2x)

                                         (x2 + 1)2

                    =      6x3 - 6x2 + 6x - 6 - 6x3 + 12x2 - 8x

                                         (x2 + 1)2

                       6x2 - 2x - 6
                    = (x2 + 1)2 .

Example 1.7.12. We may use either 1.7.30 or 1.7.37 to differentiate

                                         5                                (1.7.38)
                                y = x2 + 1 .

In either case, we obtain

                  dy dx = - (x2 + 1)2 5 ddx (x2 + 1) = - (x2 + 1)2 10x .  (1.7.39)

1.7.6 Composition of functions

Suppose y is a differentiable function of u and u is a differentiable function of
x. Then y is both a function of u and a function of x, and so we may ask for
the derivative of y with respect to x as well as the derivative of y with respect
to u. Now if dx is an infinitesimal, then

                            du = u(x + dx) - u(x)

is also an infinitesimal (since u is continuous). If du = 0, then the derivative of
y with respect to u is equal to the shadow of du dy . At the same time, if dx = 0,
the derivative of u with respect to x is equal to the shadow of dx du . But

                                dy du dy                             (1.7.40)
                                        =,

                                du dx dx

and the shadow of    dy  is the derivative of y  with respect to x.  It follows that
                     dx

the derivative of y with respect to x is the product of the derivative of y with

respect to u and the derivative of u with respect to x. Of course, du is not

necessarily nonzero even if dx = 0 (for example, if u is a constant function), but

the result holds nevertheless, although we will not go into the technical details

here.

We call this result the chain rule.

Theorem 1.7.9. If y is a differentiable function of u and u is a differentiable

function of x, then

                                dy dy du         .                   (1.7.41)
                                =
                                dx du dx

Not that if we let y = f (u), u = g(x), and

                            h(x) = f  g(x) = f (g(x)),

then   dy                   dy                      du

                     = h (x), = f (g(x)), and = g (x).
       dx                   du                      dx

Hence we may also express the chain rule in the form

                            h (x) = f (g(x))g (x).                   (1.7.42)

Example 1.7.13. If y = 3u2 and u = 2x + 1, then

                     dy dy du
                         =     = (6u)(2) = 12u = 24x + 12.
                     dx du dx

We may verify this result by first finding y directly in terms of x, namely,

       y = 3u2 = 3(2x + 1)2 = 3(4x2 + 4x + 1) = 12x2 + 12x + 3,

and then differentiating directly:
                           dy = d (12x2 + 12x + 3) = 24x + 12.

Note  that  if  we  want  to  evaluate  dy  when,  for  example,  x  =  2,  we  may  either
                                        dx

evaluate the final form, that is,

                         dy
                         dx x=2 = (24x + 12)|x=2 = 48 + 12 = 60,
or, noting that u = 5 when x = 2, the intermediate form, that is,

                              dy
                              dx x=2 = 12u|u=5 = 60.

In other words,

                              dy        =   dy du       .

                              dx x=2 du u=5 dx x=2

Exercise 1.7.11.    If y = u3 + 5 and u = x2 - 1, find     dy           .
                                                           dx
                                                                  x=1

Example 1.7.14. If h(x) = x2 + 1, then h(x) = f (g(x)) where f (x) = x
and g(x) = x2 + 1. Since

                                           1
                              f (x) =  and g (x) = 2x,

                                         2x

it follows that

                 h (x) = f (g(x))g (x) =  1 · 2x =  x .

Exercise 1.7.12. Find the derivative of f (x) = 4x + 6.
Exercise 1.7.13. Find the derivative of y = (x2 + 5)10.

Example 1.7.15. As we saw in Example 1.2.5, if M is the mass, in grams, of
a spherical balloon being filled with water and r is the radius of the balloon, in
centimeters, then

                                        M = 4 r3 grams
                                                3

and
                                dM = 4r2 grams/centimeter,
                                 dr

a result which we may verify easily now using the power rule. Suppose water
is being pumped into the balloon so that the radius of the balloon is increasing
at the rate of 0.1 centimeters per second when the balloon has a radius of 10
centimeters. Since M is a function of time t, as well as a function of the radius
1.7. PROPERTIES OF DERIVATIVES                                                                   35

of the balloon r, we might wish to know the rate of change of M with respect
to t. Since we are given that

                              dr
                                        = 0.1 centimeters/second,

                              dt r=10
we may use the chain rule to find that

       dM           =   dM           dr        = (400)(0.1) = 40 grams/second.

           dt r=10 dr r=10 dt r=10

Exercise 1.7.14. Suppose A is the area and r is the radius of a circular wave
at time t. Suppose when r = 100 centimeters the radius of the circle is increasing
at a rate of 2 centimeters per second. Find the rate at which the area of the
circle is growing when r = 100 centimeters.

Exercise 1.7.15. If water is being pumped into a spherical balloon at the rate
of 100 grams per second, find the rate of change of the radius r of the balloon
when the radius of the balloon is r = 15 centimeters.

    As an important special case of the chain rule, suppose n = 0 is an integer,
g is a differentiable function, and h(x) = (g(x))n. Then h is the composition of
f (x) = xn with g, and so, using the chain rule,

                        h (x) = f (g(x))g (x) = n(g(x))n-1g (x).                    (1.7.43)

If we let u = g(x), we could also express this result as

                                     d un = nun-1 du .                              (1.7.44)
                                     dx                  dx

Example 1.7.16. With n = 10 and g(x) = x2 + 3, we have

                    d (x2 + 3)10 = 10(x2 + 3)9(2x) = 20x(x2 + 3)9.
                    dx

Example 1.7.17. If

                                                   15
                                     f (x) = (x4 + 5)2 ,

then we may apply the previous result with n = -2 and g(x) = x4 + 5 to obtain

                                         4        -3 3             120x3
                        f (x) = -30(x + 5) (4x ) = - 4 3 .
                                                                   (x + 5)

We may use the previous result to derive yet another extension to the power

rule.  If  n  =  0  is  an  integer  and    y  =      1  then  yn  =  x,  and  so,  assuming  y  is

                                                  xn,

differentiable,

                                            d yn = d x.                             (1.7.45)

36                                                             CHAPTER 1. DERIVATIVES

Hence                                    nyn-1 dy = 1,                                                                                                         (1.7.46)
from which if follows that                       dx                                                                                                            (1.7.47)

                    dy dx = nyn-1 1 = 1n y1-n = 1n x n1           = x n 1-n 1 1 -1,
                                                                           n

showing that the power rule works for rational powers of the form 1n . Note that
the above derivation is not complete since we began with the assumption that

               1

y = x n is differentiable. Although it is beyond the scope of this text, it may be

shown that this assumption is justified for x > 0 if n is even, and for all x = 0

if n is odd.

    Now if m = 0 is also an integer, we have, using the chain rule as above,

                               dm        =   d       1m
                                  xn                 xn
                                             dx
                               dx

                                         = m x n1 x n m-1 1 1 -1                                                                                               (1.7.48)
                                                             n

                                         = m x n n m-1 + 1 -1
                                            n

                                         = m x m n -1.
                                            n

Hence we now see that the power rule holds for any non-zero rational exponent.

Theorem 1.7.10. If r = 0 is any rational number, then

                                                                         2

that y is not differentiable at 0.

x and r = 0 is a rational number, then

                                         d ur = rur-1 du .                                                                                                     (1.7.50)

1.7.7 Trigonometric functions

If y = sin(x) and w = cos(x), then, for any infinitesimal dx,

                   dy = sin(x + dx) - sin(x)                               (1.7.51)
                       = sin(x) cos(dx) + sin(dx) cos(x) - sin(x)
                       = sin(x)(cos(dx) - 1) + cos(x) sin(dx)              (1.7.52)
                                                                           (1.7.53)
and                                                                        (1.7.54)
                                                                           (1.7.55)
                      dw = cos(x + dx) - cos(x)                            (1.7.56)
                           = cos(x) cos(dx) - sin(x) sin(dx) - cos(x)
                           = cos(x)(cos(dx) - 1) - sin(x) sin(dx).

Hence, if dx = 0,

                   dy  = cos(x)  sin(dx)      - sin(x)  1 - cos(dx)

                   dx                 dx                      dx

and                dw              sin(dx)                 1 - cos(dx)

                   dx  = - sin(x)     dx      + cos(x)        dx        .

Now from (1.5.13) we know that

                       0  1 - cos(dx)           (dx)2      ,

                                                        2

and so                             1 - cos(x) dx

                       0                  dx  .

38                                             CHAPTER 1. DERIVATIVES

Hence

           1 - cos(dx)                                                  (1.7.57)

                                       dx

is an infinitesimal. Moreover, from (1.5.36), we know that

           sin(dx)                                                      (1.7.58)
                        1.                                              (1.7.59)
                                                                        (1.7.60)
              dx

Hence      dy
                  cos(x)(1) - sin(x)(0) = cos(x)

           dx

and
                         dw
                                  - sin(x)(1) + cos(x)(0) = - sin(x)
                          dx

That is, we have shown the following.

Exercise 1.7.22. Find the derivative of f (t) = tan2(3t).

1.8 A geometric interpretation of the derivative

Recall that if y = f (x), then, for any real number x,

                               y f (x + x) - f (x)                                    (1.8.1)
                                        =
                               x                   x

is the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval [x, x + x]

(see (1.2.7)). Now if the graph of y is a straight line, that is, if f (x) = mx + b

for some real numbers m and b, then (1.8.1) is m, the slope of the line. In fact,

a straight line is characterized by the fact that (1.8.1) is the same for any values

of x and x. Moreover, (1.8.1) remains the same when x is infinitesimal; that

is, the derivative of y with respect to x is the slope of the line.

     For other differentiable functions f , the value of (1.8.1) depends upon both

x and x. However, for infinitesimal values of x, the shadow of (1.8.1), that

is,  the  derivative  dx dy ,  depends  on  x  alone.  Hence  it  is  reasonable  to  think  of  dy
                                                                                                 dx

as the slope of the curve y = f (x) at a point x. Whereas the slope of a straight

line is constant from point to point, for other differentiable functions the value

of the slope of the curve will vary from point to point.

     If f is differentiable at a point a, we call the line with slope f (a) passing

through (a, f (a)) the tangent line to the graph of f at (a, f (a)). That is, the

tangent line to the graph of y = f (x) at x = a is the line with equation

                               y = f (a)(x - a) + f (a).                              (1.8.2)

Hence a tangent line to the graph of a function f is a line through a point on
the graph of f whose slope is equal to the slope of the graph at that point.

Example 1.8.1. If f (x) = x5 - 6x2 + 5, then

                                        f (x) = 5x4 - 12x.

In particular, f - 12 = 16 101 , and so the equation of the line tangent to the
graph of f at x = - 12 is

                               y=       101            1 111
                                                   x+ + .

1.9 Increasing, decreasing, and local extrema

Recall that the slope of a line is positive if, and only if, the line rises from left
to right. That is, if m > 0, f (x) = mx + b, and u < v, then

                   f (v) = mv + b                                      (1.9.1)
                         = mv - mu + mu + b
                         = m(v - u) + mu + b
                         > mu + b
                         = f (u).

We should expect that an analogous statement holds for differentiable functions:
if f is differentiable and f (x) > 0 for all x in an interval (a, b), then f (v) > f (u)
for any v > u in (a, b). This is in fact the case, although the inference requires
establishing a direct connection between slope at a point and the average slope
1.9. INCREASING, DECREASING, AND LOCAL EXTREMA                   41

over an interval, or, in terms of rates of change, between the instantaneous
rate of change at a point and the average rate of change over an interval. The
mean-value theorem makes this connection.

1.9.1 The mean-value theorem

Recall that the extreme value property tells us that a continuous function on a
closed interval must attain both a minimum and a maximum value. Suppose f
is continuous on [a, b], differentiable on (a, b), and f attains a maximum value
at c with a < c < b. In particular, for any infinitesimal dx, f (c)  f (c + dx),
and so, equivalently, f (c + dx) - f (c)  0. It follows that if dx > 0,

                          f (c + dx) - f (c)                     (1.9.2)
                                                 0,

                                   dx

and if dx < 0,

                          f (c + dx) - f (c)                     (1.9.3)
                                                 0.

                                   dx

Since both of these values must be infinitesimally close to the same real number,

it must be the case that

                          f (c + dx) - f (c)                     (1.9.4)
                                                    0.

                                   dx

That is, we must have f (c) = 0. A similar result holds if f has a minimum at
c, and so we have the following basic result.

Theorem 1.9.1. If f is differentiable on (a, b) and attains a maximum, or a
minimum, value at c, then f (c) = 0.

    Now suppose f is continuous on [a, b], differentiable on (a, b), and f (a) =
f (b). If f is a constant function, then f (c) = 0 for all c in (a, b). If f is not
constant, then there is a point c in (a, b) at which f attains either a maximum
or a minimum value, and so f (c) = 0. In either case, we have the following
result, known as Rolle's theorem.

Theorem 1.9.2. If f is continuous on [a, b], differentiable on (a, b), and f (a) =
f (b), then there is a real number c in (a, b) for which f (c) = 0.

     More generally, suppose f is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b).

Let                             f (b) - f (a)

                g(x) = f (x) -  b-a            (x - a) - f (a).  (1.9.5)

Note that g(x) is the difference between f (x) and the corresponding y value
on the line passing through (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)). Moroever, g is continuous
on [a, b], differentiable on (a, b), and g(a) = 0 = g(b). Hence Rolle's theorem
applies to g, so there must exist a point c in (a, b) for which g (c) = 0. Now

                          g (c) = f (x) -  f (b) - f (a)  ,      (1.9.6)

                           f (c) =  f (b) - f (a))    .                    (1.9.9)

                                    b-a

Example 1.9.1. Consider the function f (x) = x3 - 3x + 1 on the interval [0, 2].

By the mean-value theorem, there must exist at least one point c in [0, 2] for

which

                   f (c) =  f (2) - f (0) 3 - 1          = 1.
                                                =
                            2-0                    2

Now f (x) = 3x2 - 3, so f (c) = 1 implies 3c2 - 3 = 1. Hence c = 43 . Note

that this implies that the tangent line to the graph of f at x =    4  is  parallel
                                                                    3

to the line through the endpoints of the graph of f , that is, the points (0, 1) and

(2, 3). See Figure 1.9.1.

1.9.2 Increasing and decreasing functions

The preceding discussion leads us to the following definition and theorem.

Definition 1.9.1. We say a function f is increasing on an interval I if, whenever
a < b are points in I, f (a) < f (b). Similarly, we say f is decreasing on I if,
whenever a < b are points in I, f (a) > f (b).

    Now suppose f is a defined on an interval I and f (x) > 0 for every x in I
which is not an endpoint of I. Then given any a and b in I, by the mean-value
theorem there exists a point c between a and b for which

f (b) - f (a)                                   (1.9.10)
                = f (c) > 0.

    b-a

Since b - a > 0, this implies that f (b) > f (a). Hence f is increasing on I. A
similar argument shows that f is decreasing on I if f (x) < 0 for every x in I
which is not an endpoint of I.

Theorem 1.9.4. Suppose f is defined on an interval I. If f (x) > 0 for every
x in I which is not an endpoint of I, then f is increasing on I. If f (x) < 0 for
every x in I which is not an endpoint of I, then f is decreasing on I.

Example 1.9.2. Let f (x) = 2x3 - 3x2 - 12x + 1. Then

              f (x) = 6x2 - 6x - 12 = 6(x2 - x - 2) = 6(x - 2)(x + 1).

Hence f (x) = 0 when x = -1 and when x = 2. Now x - 2 < 0 for x < 2
and x - 2 > 0 for x > 2, while x + 1 < 0 for x < -1 and x + 1 > 0 when
x > -1. Thus f (x) > 0 when x < -1 and when x > 2, and f (x) < 0 when
-1 < x < 2. It follows that f is increasing on the intervals (-, -1) and
(2, ), and decreasing on the interval (-1, 2).

    Note that the theorem requires only that we know the sign of f at points
inside a given interval, not at the endpoints. Hence it actually allows us to make
the slightly stronger statement that f is increasing on the intervals (-, -1]
and [2, ), and decreasing on the interval [-1, 2].

    Since f is increasing on (-, -1] and decreasing on [-1, 2], the point (-1, 8)
must be a high point on the graph of f , although not necessarily the highest
point on the graph. We say that f has a local maximum of 8 at x = -1.
Similarly, f is decreasing on [-1, 2] and increasing on [2, ), and so the point
(2, -19) must be a low point on the graph of f , although, again, not necessarily
the lowest point on the graph. We say that f has a local minimum of -19 at
x = 2. From this information, we can begin to see why the graph of f looks as
it does in Figure 1.9.2.

Definition 1.9.2. We say f has a local maximum at a point c if there exists an
interval (a, b) containing c for which f (c)  f (x) for all x in (a, b). Similarly, we
say f has a local minimum at a point c if there exists an interval (a, b) containing
c for which f (c)  f (x) for all x in (a, b). We say f has a local extremum at c
if f has either a local maximum or a local minimum at c.

    We may now rephrase Theorem 1.9.1 as follows.

Theorem 1.9.5. If f is differentiable at c and has a local extremum at c, then
f (c) = 0.

    As illustrated in the preceding example, we may identify local minimums of
a function f by locating those points at which f changes from decreasing to
increasing, and local maximums by locating those points at which f changes
from increasing to decreasing.

Example 1.9.3. Let f (x) = x + 2 sin(x). Then f (x) = 1 + 2 cos(x), and so
f (x) < 0 when, and only when,

                                                          1
                                           cos(x) < - .

                                                          2
For 0  x  2, this occurs when, and only when,

                   2         4
                          <x< .
                   3         3

Since the cosine function has period 2, if follows that f (x) < 0 when, and
only when, x is in an interval of the form

                2         4

                3         3

for n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .. Hence f is decreasing on these intervals and increasing

1.10 Optimization

Optimization problems, that is, problems in which we seek to find the greatest or
smallest value of some quantity, are common in the applications of mathematics.
46                                     CHAPTER 1. DERIVATIVES

Because of the extreme-value property, there is a straightforward algorithm
for solving optimization problems involving continuous functions on closed and
bounded intervals. Hence we will treat this case first before considering functions
on other intervals.

    Recall that if f (c) is the maximum, or minimum, value of f on some interval
I and f is differentiable at c, then f (c) = 0. Consequently, points at which the
derivative vanishes will play an important role in our work on optimization.

Definition 1.10.1. We call a real number c where f (c) = 0 a stationary point
of f .

1.10.1 Optimization on a closed interval

Suppose f is a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval [a, b]. By
the extreme-value property, f attains a maximum, as well as a minimum value,
on [a, b]. In particular, there is a real number c in [a, b] such that f (c)  f (x)
for all x in [a, b]. If c is in (a, b) and f is differentiable at c, then we must have
f (c) = 0. The only other possibilities are that f is not differentiable at c, c = a,
or c = b. Similar comments hold for points at which a minimum value occurs.

Definition 1.10.2. We call a real number c a singular point of a function f if
f is defined on an open interval containing c, but is not differentiable at c.

Theorem 1.10.1. If f is a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval
[a, b], then the maximum and minimum values of f occur at either (1) stationary
points in the open interval (a, b), (2) singular points in the open interval (a, b),
or (3) the endpoints of [a, b].

    Hence we have the following procedure for optimizing a continuous function
f on an interval [a, b]:

(1) Find all stationary and singular points of f in the open interval (a, b).

(2) Evaluate f at all stationary and singular points of (a, b), and at the end-
     points a and b.

(3) The maximum value of f is the largest value found in step (2) and the
     minimum value of f is the smallest value found in step (2).

Example 1.10.1. Consider the function g(t) = t - 2 cos(t) defined on the
interval [0, 2]. Then

                                       g (t) = 1 + 2 sin(t),

and so g (t) = 0 when

                                    1
                       sin(t) = - .

                                    2

For t in the open interval (0, 2), this means that either

differentiable at all points in (0, 2), and so there are no singular points of g in

(0, 2). Hence to identify the extreme values of g we need evaluate only

and
                                  g(2) = 2 - 2  4.28319.

                                                                6

Example 1.10.2. Suppose we inscribe a rectangle R inside the ellipse E with

equation

                      4x2 + y2 = 16,

as shown in Figure 1.10.2. If we let (x, y) be the coordinates of the upper
right-hand corner of R, then the area of R is

                      A = (2x)(2y) = 4xy.

Since (x, y) is a point on the upper half of the ellipse, we have

                      y = 16 - 4x2 = 2 4 - x2,

and so

                      A = 8x 4 - x2.

Now suppose we wish to find the dimensions of R which maximize its area. That
is, we want to find the maximum value of A on the interval [0, 2]. Now

    dA           -2x  2 -8x2 + 8(4 - x2) 32 - 16x2
          = 8x ·      +8 4-x =                                   =          .
    dx    2 4 - x2                                       4 - x2     4 - x2

Hence dx dA = 0, for x in (0, 2), when 32 - 16x2 = 0, that is, when x = 2. Thus
                                                                     

the maximum value of A must occur at x = 0, x = 2, or x = 2. Evaluating,

we have

                              A|x=0 = 0,
                                     

                      A|x=2 = 8 2 2 = 16,

and
                                             A|x=2 = 0.

Hence the rectangle R inscribed in Ewith the largest area has area 16 when
x = 2 and y = 2 2. That is, R is 2 2 by 4 2.

Exercise 1.10.3. Find the dimensions of the rectangle R with largest area

where a and b are positive real numbers.

1.10.2 Optimization on other intervals

We now consider the case of a continuous function f on an interval I which is
either not closed or not bounded. The extreme-value property does not apply
in this case, and, as we have seen, we have no guarantee that f has an extreme
value on the interval. Hence, in general, this situation requires more careful
analysis than that of the previous section.

    However, there is one case which arises frequently and which is capable of
a simple analysis. Suppose that c is a point in I which is either a stationary
or singular point of f , and that f is differentiable at all other points of I. If
f (x) < 0 for all x in I with x < c and f (x) > 0 for all x in I with c < x, then
f is decreasing before c and increasing after c, and so must have a minimum
value at c. Similarly, if f (x) > 0 for all x in I with x < c and f (x) < 0 for all
x in I with c < x, then f is increasing before c and decreasing after c, and so
must have a maximum value at c. The next examples will illustrate.

Example 1.10.3. Consider the problem of finding the extreme values of

                                     y = 4x2 + 1
                                                   x

on the interval (0, ). Since

                                     dy               1
                                     dx = 8x - x2 ,

This is equivalent to

                                                     x3 < 1 ,
                                                            8

so  dy  < 0 on (0, ) when, and only when, 0 < x <                                 12 .  Similarly, we see that
    dx
dy
dx  >0  when,        and   only  when,        x>     12 .  Thus      y  is  a  decreasing  function       of   x  on

the interval 0, 12 and an increasing function of x on the interval 12 ,  , and
so must have an minimum value at x = 12 . Note, however, that y does not have
                                                                 1
a  maximum        value:   given    any    x  =  c,  if    c  <  2  we  may       find  a  larger  value  for  y  by

using   any  0    <  x  <  c,  and  if  c  >  1  we  may         find   a  larger  value   for  y  by  using   any
                                              2
x > c. Thus we conclude that y has a minimum value of 3 at x = 12 , but does

not have a maximum value. See Figure 1.10.3.

Example 1.10.4. Consider the problem of finding the shortest distance from
the point A = (0, 1) to the parabola P with equation y = x2. If (x, y) is a point
on P (see Figure 1.10.4), then the distance from A to (x, y) is

                     D = (x - 0)2 + (y - 1)2 = x2 + (x2 - 1)2.

Our problem then is to find the minimum value of D on the interval (-, ).
However, to make the problem somewhat easier to work with, we note that,
since D is always a positive value, finding the minimum value of D is equivalent
to finding the minimum value of D2. So letting

            z = D2 = x2 + (x2 - 1)2 = x2 + x4 - 2x2 + 1 = x4 - x2 + 1,

our problem becomes that of finding the minimum value of z on (-, ). Now

                                          dz = 4x3 - 2x,

0 < x < 12 , and ddxz > 0 when - 12 < x < 0 and when x > 12 . It follows

that z is a decreasing function of x on                    -, - 1                and on         0, 1 , and is an

     It  now   follows  that  z  has  a  local  minimum           of  3  at     x   =  - 1 ,    a  local    maximum

the minimum value of z both on the the interval (-, 0) and on the interval

(0, );   since  z   has  a  local  maximum       of     1  at  x  =   0,    it   follows   that    3  is    in  fact  the

distance from A to P is 3 2 , and the points on P closest to A are - 12 , 12 and

  12 , 12 . Note, however, that z does not have a maximum value, even though
it has a local maximum value at x = 0. See Figure 1.10.5 for the graph of z.

1.11 Implicit differentiation and rates of change

Many curves of interest are not the graphs of functions. For example, for con-
stants a > 0 and b > 0, the equation

         x2 y2                                                           (1.11.1)
         a2 + b2 = 1

describes an ellipse E which intersects the x-axis at (-a, 0) and (a, 0) and the
y-axis at (-b, 0) and (b, 0) (see Figure 1.11.1). The ellipse E is not the graph
of a function since, for any -a < x < a, both

              b                      a2 - x2                             (1.11.2)

lie on E. Nevertheless, we expect that E will have a tangent line at every point.
Note, however, that the tangent lines at (-a, 0) and (a, 0) are vertical lines, and
so do not have a slope. At all other points, we may find the slope of the tangent
line by treating y in (1.11.1) as a function of x, differentiating both sides of the
equation with respect to x, and solving for dx dy . In general, given a function f
of x and y and a constant c, this technique will work to find the slope of the
curve defined by an equation f (x, y) = c. Note that in applying this technique
we are assuming that y is differentiable. This is in fact true for a wide range
of relationships defined by f , but the technical details are beyond the scope of
this text.

Example 1.11.1. Using a = 2 and b = 1, (1.11.1) becomes, after multiplying
both sides of the equation by 4,

                                           x2 + 4y2 = 4.

Differentiating both sides of this equation by x, and remembering to use the
chain rule when differentiating y2, we obtain

                                       dy
                             2x + 8y = 0.

                                       dx

Solving for dx dy , we have

                             dy  x
                                 =- ,
                             dx 4y

which is defined whenever y = 0 (corresponding to the points (-2, 0) and (2, 0),
at which, as we saw above, the slope of the tangent lines is undefined). For

Example 1.11.2. Consider the hyperbola H with equation
                                       x2 - 4xy + y2 = 4.

Differentiating both sides of the equation, remembering to treat y as a function

of x, we have

                        2x - 4x - 4y + 2y = 0.

    The technique described above, known as implicit differentiation, is also
useful in finding rates of change for variables related by an equation. The next
examples illustrate this idea, with the first being similar to examples we saw
earlier while discussing the chain rule.

Example 1.11.3. Suppose oil is being poured onto the surface of a calm body
of water. As the oil spreads out, it forms a right circular cylinder whose volume
is

                                             V = r2h,

where r and h are, respectively, the radius and height of the cylinder. Now
suppose the oil is being poured out at a rate of 10 cubic centimeters per second

and that the height remains a constant 0.25 centimeters. Then the volume of
the cylinder is increasing at a rate of 10 cubic centimeters per second, so

                                        dV = 10 cm3/sec
                                         dt
at any time t. Now with h = 0.25,

                                           V = 0.25r2,

so

Hence      dr 2 dV 20

Example 1.11.4. Suppose ship A, headed due north at 20 miles per hour, and
ship B, headed due east at 30 miles per hour, both pass through the same point
P in the ocean, ship A at noon and ship B two hours later (see Figure 1.11.4).
If we let x denote the distance from A to P t hours after noon, y denote the
distance from B to P t hours after noon, and z denote the distance from A to
B t hours after noon, then, by the Pythagorean theorem,

                                           z2 = x2 + y2.

Differentiating this equation with respect to t, we find

                                       dz         dx dy
                                       2z = 2x + 2y ,

                                         dt dt dt

For example, at 4 in the afternoon, that is, when t = 4, we know that

                                       x = (4)(20) = 80 miles,

                                       y = (2)(30) = 60 miles,

and
                                 z = 802 + 602 = 100 miles,

so                                dz         dx       dy

                           100 = 80 + 60 miles/hour.

Since at any time t,

                                           = 20 miles/hour

                                       dt

we have                dz          (80)(20) + (60)(30)

                       dt t=4  =             100              = 34 miles/hour.

1.12 Higher-order derivatives

Given two quantities, y and x, with y a function of x, we know that the derivative

dy  is  the  rate  of  change  of  y   with  respect  to  x.  Since  dy  is  then  itself  a  function
dx                                                                   dx

of x, we may ask for its rate of change with respect to x, which we call the

second-order derivative of y with respect to x and denote dx2 d2y .
58                                                       CHAPTER 1. DERIVATIVES

Example 1.12.1. If y = 4x5 - 3x2 + 4, then

                    dy = 20x4 - 6x,
                    dx

and so

                    d2y = 80x3 - 6.
                    dx2

Of course, we could continue to differentiate:           the third derivative  of y with
respect to x is

                                           d3y = 240x2,
                                           dx3

the fourth derivative of y with respect to x is

                    d4y
                    dx4 = 480x,

and so on.

    If y is a function of x with y = f (x), then we may also denote the second
derivative of y with respect to x by f (x), the third derivative by f (x), and
so on. The prime notation becomes cumbersome after awhile, and so we may
replace the primes with the corresponding number in parentheses; that is, we
may write, for example, f (x) as f (4)(x).

                                  2
                     f (x) = x3 ,

                                   6

1.12.1 Acceleration

If x is the position, at time t, of an object moving along a straight line, then we

know that                 dx
                     v=
                                                                (1.12.1)
                           dt

is the velocity of the object at time t. Since acceleration is the rate of change

of velocity, it follows that the acceleration of the object is

                           dv d2x                               (1.12.2)
                     a = dt = dt2 .

Example 1.12.3. Suppose an object, such as a lead ball, is dropped from a
height of 100 meters. Ignoring air resistance, the height of the ball above the
earth after t seconds is given by

           x(t) = 100 - 4.9t2 meters,

as we discussed in Section 1.2. Hence the velocity of the object after t seconds
is

                                  v(t) = -9.8t meters/second

and the acceleration of the object is

                                 a(t) = -9.8 meters/second2.

Thus the acceleration of an object in free-fall near the surface of the earth, ignor-
ing air resistance, is constant. Historically, Galileo started with this observation
about acceleration of objects in free-fall and worked in the other direction to
discover the formulas for velocity and position.

Exercise 1.12.3. Suppose an object oscillating at the end of a spring has
position x = 10 cos(t) (measured in centimeters from the equilibrium position)
at time t seconds. Find the acceleration of the object at time t = 1.25.

1.12.2 Concavity

The second derivative of a function f tells us the rate at which the slope of
the graph of f is changing. Geometrically, this translates into measuring the
concavity of the graph of the function.

Definition 1.12.1. We say the graph of a function f is concave upward on an
open interval (a, b) if f is an increasing function on (a, b). We say the graph of
a function f is concave downward on an open interval (a, b) if f is a decreasing
function on (a, b).

    To determine the concavity of the graph of a function f , we need to determine
the intervals on which f is increasing and the intervals on which f is decreasing.
Hence, from our earlier work, we need identify when the derivative of f is
positive and when it is negative.

         Figure 1.12.1: Graph of f (x) = 2x3 - 3x2 - 12x + 1

Theorem 1.12.1. If f is twice differentiable on (a, b), then the graph of f is
concave upward on (a, b) if f (x) > 0 for all x in (a, b), and concave downward
on (a, b) if f (x) < 0 for all x in (a, b).

Example 1.12.4. If f (x) = 2x3 - 3x2 - 12x + 1, then

                                     f (x) = 6x2 - 6x - 12

and

                              f (x) = 12x - 6.

Hence f  (x) < 0 when x <  1   and f  (x) > 0 when x >  12 , and so the graph
                           2
of f is concave downward on the interval -, 12 and concave upward on the
interval 12 ,  . One may see the distinction between concave downward and

concave upward very clearly in the graph of f shown in Figure 1.12.1.

    We call a point on the graph of a function f at which the concavity changes,

either from upward to downward or from downward to upward, a point of in-
flection. In the previous example, 21 , - 211 is a point of inflection.

Exercise 1.12.4. Find the intervals on which the graph of f (x) = 5x3 - 3x5
is concave upward and the intervals on which the graph is concave downward.
What are the points of inflection?

1.12.3 The second-derivative test

Suppose c is a stationary point of f and f (c) > 0. Then, since f is the
derivative of f and f (c) = 0, for any infinitesimal dx = 0,

             f (c + dx) - f (c) f (c + dx)      > 0.                      (1.12.3)

                    Figure 1.12.2: Graph of f (x) = x4 - x3

It follows that f (c + dx) > 0 when dx > 0 and f (c + dx) < 0 when dx < 0.
Hence f is decreasing to the left of c and increasing to the right of c, and so f
has a local minimum at c. Similarly, if f (c) < 0 at a stationary point c, then
f has a local maximum at c. This result is the second-derivative test.

Example 1.12.5. If f (x) = x4 - x3, then

                               f (x) = 4x3 - 3x2 = x2(4x - 3)

and
                              f (x) = 12x2 - 6x = 6x(2x - 1).

Hence f has stationary points x = 0 and x = 34 . Since

                                             f (0) = 0

and

                        f      39
                                  = > 0,
                               44

we see that f has a local minimum at x = 34 . Although the second derivative

test tells us nothing about the nature of the critical point x = 0, we know, since

f has a local minimum at x = 34 , that f is decreasing on 0, 34 and increasing
on 34 ,  . Moreover, since 4x - 3 < 0 for all x < 0, it follows that f (x) < 0 for

all x < 0, and so f is also decreasing on (-, 0). Hence f has neither a local

maximum nor a local minimum at x = 0.  Finally, since f        (x)  <  0  for  0  <  x  <  1
                                                                                           2

and f (x) > 0 for all other x, we see that the graph of f is concave downward

on the interval 0, 12 and concave upward on the intervals (-, 0) and 12 ,  .

See Figure 1.12.2.

Integrals

2.1 Integrals

We now turn our attention to the other side of Zeno's arrow paradox. In the
previous chapter we began with the problem of finding the velocity of an object
given a function which defined the position of the object at every instant of
time. We now suppose that we are given a function which specifies the velocity
v of an object, moving along a straight line, at every instant of time t, and we
wish to find the position x of the object at time t. There are two approaches
to finding x; we will investigate both, leading us to the fundamental theorem of
calculus.

    First, from our earlier work we know that v is the derivative of x. That is,

               dx                          (2.1.1)
                   = v.

               dt

Hence to find x we need to find a function which has v for its derivative.

Definition 2.1.1. Given a function f defined on an open interval (a, b), we call
a function F an integral of f if F (x) = f (x) for all x in (a, b).

Example 2.1.1. If f (x) = 3x2, then F (x) = x3 is an integral of f on (-, )
since F (x) = 3x2 for all x. However, note that F is not the only integral of f :
for other examples, both G(x) = x3 + 4 and H(x) = x3 + 15 are integrals of f as
well. Indeed, since the derivative of a constant is 0 the function L(x) = x3 + c
is an integral of f for any constant c.

    In general, if F is an integral of f , then G(x) = F (x) + c is also an integral
of f for any constant c. Are there any other integrals of f ? That is, if we start
with both F and G being integrals of f , does it follow that G(x) - F (x) = c for
some constant c and for all x? To answer this question, first note that if we let
H(x) = G(x) - F (x), then

H (x) = G (x) - F (x) = f (x) - f (x) = 0  (2.1.2)

               63
64                                               CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

for all x. Hence H is an integral of the constant function g(x) = 0 for all x. So
our question becomes: If H (x) = 0 for all x, does it follow that H(x) = c for
some constant c and all x? If it does, then

                      c = H(x) = F (x) - G(x),               (2.1.3)

and indeed F and G differ by only a constant. So suppose we are given H (x) = 0
for all x in an open interval (a, b). Then, for any two points u < v in (a, b), it
follows from the mean-value theorem that

                      H(v) - H(u) = H (d)(u - v)             (2.1.4)

for some d in (a, b). But then H (d) = 0, so H(v) - H(u) = 0, that is, H(u) =
H(v). Since this is true for any arbitrary points u and v in (a, b), it follows that
H must be constant on (a, b).

Theorem 2.1.1. If F (x) = G (x) for all x in (a, b), then there exists a constant
c such that G(x) = F (x) + c for all x in (a, b).

    In particular, if F (x) = 0 for all x in (a, b), then F is constant on (a, b).

Example 2.1.2. Since

                      d 3 x2 + 4x = 3x + 4,
                      dx 2

any integral of f (x) = 3x + 4 must be of the form

                      F (x) = 3 x2 + 4x + c
                                2

for some constant c.

    We denote an integral of a function f by

                                       f (x)dx.              (2.1.5)

The motivation for this notation will be more evident once we discuss the fun-
damental theorem of calculus.

Example 2.1.3. Since

it follows that        d (4x3 - sin(x)) = 12x2 - cos(x),
                      dx
                      (12x2 - cos(x))dx = 4x3 - sin(x) + c,

where, as before, c is some constant.

    From our rules for differentiation, it follows easily that       (2.1.7)
                                       xndx = 1 xn+1 + c
                                                  n+1

for every rational n = -1, and
                                      sin(x)dx = - cos(x) + c,

                  cos(x)dx = sin(x) + c,                           (2.1.8)
                 sec2(x)dx = tan(x) + c,                           (2.1.9)
                csc2(x)dx = - csc(x) + c,                         (2.1.10)

                sec(x) tan(x)dx = sec(x) + c,                     (2.1.11)

and

                csc(x) cot(x)dx = - csc(x) + c,                   (2.1.12)

where in each case c represents an arbitrary constant. Note that differentiation
of the right-hand side of each of the above verifies these statements. Moreover,
if follows from our work with derivatives that for any functions f and g and any
constant k,

                (f (x) + g(x))dx = f (x)dx + g(x)dx,              (2.1.13)

                (f (x) - g(x))dx = f (x)dx - g(x)dx,              (2.1.14)

and

                kf (x)dx = k f (x)dx.                             (2.1.15)

Example 2.1.7. Suppose we wish to find the integral F (x) of f (x) = 5x2 - 7
for which F (1) = 10. Now

                     (5x2 - 7)dx = 5 x3 - 7x + c,
                                        3

so
                                      F (x) = 5 x3 - 7x + c
                                                 3

for some constant c. Now we want

                                      5
                     10 = F (1) = - 7 + c,

                                      3

so we must have                                 5 46
                               c = 10 + 7 - = .

                                                33

Hence the desired integral is

                     F (x) = 5 x3 - 7x + 46 .

Note that, geometrically, from the family of parallel curves with equations of

the form y = 53 x3 - 7x + c, we are finding the one that passes through the point
(1, 10). Figure 2.1.1 shows five such curves, with the graph of F in blue.

Exercise 2.1.2. Find an integral F of f (x) = 5x4 - 4x which satisfies F (2) =
12.

    Returning to our original problem, we can now say that if v(t) is, at time
t, the velocity of an object moving along a straight line and x(t) is the object's
position at time t, then

                x(t) = v(t)dt.                     (2.1.16)

However, note that (2.1.16) is little more than a restatement of (2.1.1) with new
notation.

Example 2.1.8. Suppose the velocity of an object oscillating at the end of a
spring is

                          v(t) = -20 sin(5t) centimeters/second.

If x(t) is the position of the object at time t, then

x(t) = - 20 sin(5t)dt = 4 cos(5t) + c centimeters

for some constant c. If in addition we know that the object was initially 4
centimeters from the origin, that is, that x(0) = 4, then we would have

                                        4 = x(0) = 4 + c.
Hence we would have c = 0, and so

                                  x(t) = 4 cos(5t) centimeters
completely specifies the position of the object at time t.

Exercise 2.1.3. Suppose the velocity of an object at time t is v(t) = 10 sin(t)
centimeters per second. Find x(t), the position of the object at time t, if x(0) =
10 centimeters.

2.1.1 The case of constant acceleration

Galileo was the first to notice that, ignoring the effects of air resistance, objects
in free fall near the surface of the earth fall with constant acceleration. Suppose
that x(t), v(t), and a(t) specify, at time t, the position, velocity, and acceleration
of an object moving along a straight line, and, moreover, suppose

                a(t) = g                           (2.1.17)

for some constant g and all values of t. Since acceleration is the derivative of
velocity, it follows that

                v(t) = a(t)dt = gdt = gt + c       (2.1.18)
68                                              CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

for some constant c. Now if we let v0 = v(0), the velocity of the object at time

t = 0, then

                               v0 = v(0) = c.                     (2.1.19)

Hence

                               v(t) = gt + v0.                    (2.1.20)

Next we see that

             x(t) =  v(t)dt =  (gt + v0)dt = 1 gt2 + v0t + c      (2.1.21)
                                                 2

for some constant c. If we let x0 = x(0), the position of the object at time t = 0,

then

                               x0 = x(0) = c.                     (2.1.22)

Hence we have        x(t) = 1 gt2 + v0t + x0.
                              2
                                                                  (2.1.23)

In the important case of an object in free fall near the surface of the earth, g is

the constant acceleration due to gravity. When working in units of meters and

seconds, and taking up as the positive direction, we have g = -9.8 meters per

second per second, and when working with units of feet and seconds g = -32

feet per second per second. Hence, in the former case, (2.1.23) becomes

                     x(t) = -4.9t2 + v0t + x0                     (2.1.24)

and, in the latter case, (2.1.23) becomes                         (2.1.25)
                                    x(t) = -16t2 + v0t + x0.

Example 2.1.9. Suppose an object is thrown upward from atop a 10 meter
tall tower with an initial velocity of 20 meters per second. Then, using (2.1.24),
the position of the object after t seconds is

                              x(t) = -4.9t2 + 20t + 10 meters.

Hence, for example, since the object will reach its maximum height when its
velocity is 0, we see that the object reaches its maximum height when

                               -9.8t + 20 = 0,

that is, when

                          20
                     t =  2.04 seconds.

                          9.8

Thus the object will reach a maximum height of

             x(2.04)  -4.9(2.04)2 + 20(2.04) + 10  30.41 meters.

Exercise 2.1.4. For an object in free-fall near the surface of Mars, g = -3.69
meters per second per second. Find the maximum height reached by an object
thrown vertically into the air from atop a 10 meter tall tower on Mars with an
initial velocity of 20 meters per second.

2.2 Definite integrals

We will now consider another approach to solving the problem of finding the
position function given a velocity function. As above, suppose v(t) specifies, at
time t, the velocity of an object moving along a straight line, starting at time
t = a and ending at time t = b. Let x(t) be the position of the object at time t
and let x0 = x(a) be the initial position of the object.

    Recall that if an object travels at constant velocity r for a time T , then its
change in position is simply rT (to the right if r > 0 and to the left if r < 0).
It follows that if v(t) were constant, say v(t) = r for some fixed real number r
and all t in [a, b], then

                          x(t) = x(a) + r(t - a) = x0 + r(t - a)     (2.2.1)

since the object will have been traveling, after starting at x0, at a velocity r for
a time period of length t - a.

    If v(t) is not constant, but doesn't vary by much, then (2.2.1) will give a good
approximation to x(t). In general, v may change significantly over the interval,
but, as long as v is a continuous function, we can subdivide [a, b] into small
intervals for which v(t) does not change by much over any given subinterval.
That is, if we choose points t0, t1, t2, . . . , tn such that

                            a = t0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tn = b,       (2.2.2)

let ti = ti - ti-1 for i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n, and choose real numbers t1, t2, t3, . . . ,
t                     ti
    so  that  ti-1          ti,  then
 n
                                       v(ti )ti
                                                                     (2.2.3)

will approximate well the change of position of the object from time t = ti-1 to
time t = ti, provided v is continuous and ti is small. It follows that we may
approximate the position of the object at time t = b by adding together all the
approximate changes in position over the subintervals. That is,

              x(b)  x(a) + v(t1)t1 + v(t2)t2 + · · · + v(tn)tn.      (2.2.4)

Example 2.2.1. In an earlier example, we had v(t) = -20 sin(5t) centimeters
per second and x(0) = 4 centimeters. To approximate x(2), we will divide [0, 2]
into four equal subintervals, each of length 0.5. That is, we will take

                      t0 = 0.0, t1 = 0.5, t2 = 1, t3 = 1.5, t4 = 2,

and
                        t1 = 0.5, t2 = 0.5, t3 = 0.5, t4 = 0.5.

Good choices for points to evaluate v(t) are the midpoints of the subintervals.
In this case, that means we should take

                          t1 = 0.25, t2 = 0.75, t3 = 1.25, t4 = 1.75.
70  CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

Then we have

        x(2)  x(0) + v(0.25)t1 + v(0.75)t2 + v(1.25)t3 + v(1.75)t4
               = 4 - 20 sin(1.25)(0.5) - 20 sin(3.75)(0.5) - 20 sin(6.25)(0.5)
                           - 20 sin(8.75)(0.5)
                -5.6897,

Note that, from our earlier work, we know that the exact answer is

                                 x(2) = 4 cos(10)  -3.3563.

We may improve upon our approximation by using smaller subintervals. For
example, if we divide [0, 2] into 10 equal subintervals, each of length 0.2, then
we would have

                 t0 = 0.0, t1 = 0.2, t2 = 0.4, t3 = 0.6, t4 = 0.8, t5 = 1.0,
                 t6 = 1.2, t7 = 1.4, t8 = 1.6, t9 = 1.8, t10 = 2.0

and
                               t1 = t2 = · · · = t10 = 0.2.

If we evaluate v(t) at the midpoints again, then we take

                      t1 = 0.1, t2 = 0.3, t3 = 0.5, t4 = 0.7, t5 = 0.9,
                      t6 = 1.1, t7 = 1.3, t8 = 1.5, t9 = 1.7, t10  = 1.9.

Hence we have

    x(2)  x(0) + v(0.1)t1 + v(0.3)t2 + v(0.5)t3 + · · · + v(1.9)t10
          = 4 + 0.2(v(0.1) + v(0.3) + v(0.5) + · · · + v(1.9))
          = 4 + 0.2(-20 sin(0.5) - 20 sin(1.5) - 20 sin(2.5) - · · · - 20 sin(9.5))
           -3.6720,

a significant improvement over our first approximation.

Exercise 2.2.1. Suppose the velocity of an object at time t is v(t) = 10 sin(t)
centimeters per second. Let x(t) be the position of the object at time t. If
x(0) = 10 centimeters, use the technique of the previous example to approximate
x(3) using (a) n = 6 and (b) n = 12 subintervals.

    One question which arises immediately is why we would want to find ap-
proximations to the position function when we already know how to find the
position function exactly using an integral. There are two answers. First, it is
not always possible to find an integral for a given function, even when an integral
does exist. For example, if the velocity function in the previous example were
v(t) = -20 sin(5t2), then it would not be possible to write an expression for the
2.2. DEFINITE INTEGRALS                                             71

integral of v in terms of the elementary functions of calculus. In this case, the
best we could do is look for good approximations for the position function x.

    Second, this approach also leads to an exact expression for the position
function. If we let N be an infinitely large positive integer and divide [a, b] into
an infinite number of equal subintervals of infinitesimal length

                             dt =          b-a  ,                   (2.2.5)

                                           N

then we should expect that

          x(b) x(a) + v(t1)dt + v(t2)dt + · · · + v(tN )dt,         (2.2.6)

where, similar to the work above, ti is a hyperreal number in the ith subinterval.
Rewriting this as

          x(b) - x(a) v(t1)dt + v(t2)dt + · · · + v(tN )dt,         (2.2.7)

we are saying that the change in position of the object from time t = a to time
t = b is equal to an infinite sum of infinitesimal changes. Although Zeno was
correct in saying that an infinite sum of zeros is still zero, an infinite sum of
infinitesimal values need not be infinitesimal.

    The right-hand side of (2.2.7) provides the motivation for the following def-
inition.

Definition 2.2.1. Suppose f is a continuous function on a closed bounded
interval [a, b]. Given a positive integer N , finite or infinite, we call a set of
numbers {t0, t1, t2, · · · , tn} a partition of [a, b] if

                       a = t0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tN = b.           (2.2.8)

Given such a partition of [a, b], let ti denote a number with ti-1  ti  ti and
let ti = ti - ti-1, where i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N . We call a sum of the form

 N                                                                  (2.2.9)

    f (ti )ti = f (t1)t1 + f (t2)t2 + f (t3)t3 + · · · + f (tN )tN

i=1

a Riemann sum. If N is infinite and the partition forms subintervals of equal

length

                       dt = t1 = t2 = · · · = tn,                   (2.2.10)

then we call the shadow of the Riemann sum the definite integral of f from a

to b, which we denote

                              b                                     (2.2.11)

                                f (t)dt.

                             a

That is,

                          b                N

                             f (t)dt = sh       f (ti )dt .         (2.2.12)

                       a                   i=1
72                                             CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

    Note that in order for (2.2.12) to make sense, we need the Riemann sum on
the right-hand side to be finite (so it has a shadow) and to have the same shadow
for all choices of infinite integers N and evaluation points ti (so the definite
integral has a unique value). These are both true for continuous functions
on closed bounded intervals, but the verifications would take us into subtle
properties of continuous functions beyond the scope of this text.

    In terms of velocity and position functions, if v(t) is the velocity and x(t)
the position of an object moving along a straight line from time t = a to time
t = b, we may now write (combining (2.2.7) with (2.2.12))

                                                  b  (2.2.13)

                   x(b) - x(a) = v(t)dt.

                                                a

Since v is the derivative of x, we might ask if (2.2.13) is true for any differentiable
function. That is, if f is differentiable on an interval which contains the real
numbers a and b, is it always the case that

                                                  b  (2.2.14)

                   f (b) - f (a) = f (t)dt?

                                                a

This is in fact true, but requires more explanation than just the intuitive ap-
proach of our example with positions and velocities. We will come back to
this important result, which we call the fundamental theorem of calculus, after
developing some properties of definite integrals.

2.3 Properties of definite integrals

Suppose f is a continuous function on a closed interval [a, b]. Let N be a positive
infinite integer, dx = N b-a , and, for i = 1, 2, · · · , N , let xi a number in the ith
subinterval of [a, b] when it is partitioned into N intervals of equal length dx.

    We first note that if f (x) = 1 for all x in [a, b], then

                N                   N

                         f (xi )dx = dx = b - a      (2.3.1)

             i=1                    i=1

since the sum of the lengths of the subintervals must be the length of the interval.

Hence                 b                b

                         f (x)dx = dx = b - a.       (2.3.2)

                   a                a

    More generally, if f (x) = k for all x in [a, b], where k is a fixed real number,

then

        N                N                N

             f (xi )dx = kdx = k dx = k(b - a),      (2.3.3)

        i=1              i=1              i=1

and so          b                b

                   f (x)dx = kdx = k(b - a).         (2.3.4)

             a                a
2.3. PROPERTIES OF DEFINITE INTEGRALS                                                              73

That is, the definite integral of a constant is the constant times the length of
the interval. In particular, the integral of 1 over an interval is simply the length
of the interval.

    If f is an arbitrary continuous function and k is a fixed constant, then

                                            N                          N

                                                 kf (xi )dx = k f (xi)dx,                          (2.3.5)

                                            i=1                        i=1

and so                                            b                          b

                                                     kf (x)dx = k f (x)dx.                         (2.3.6)

                                               a                          a

That is, the definite integral of a constant times f is the constant times the

definite integral of f .

If g is also a continuous function on [a, b], then

              N                                                  N                      N

                   (f (xi ) + g(xi ))dx = f (xi )dx + g(xi )dx,                                    (2.3.7)

              i=1                                                i=1                  i=1

and so                                                              b                    b

                                   b

                                      (f (x) + g(x))dx = f (x)dx + g(x)dx.                         (2.3.8)

                   a                                             a                    a

Now suppose c is another real number with a < c < b. If the closed interval

[a, c] is divisible into M intervals of length dx, where M is a positive infinite

integer less than N , then

                   N                                    M                       N

                                      f (xi )dx = f (xi )dx +                           f (xi )dx  (2.3.9)

                   i=1                                  i=1                     i=M +1

implies that

                                         b                    c                    b

                                            f (x)dx = f (x)dx + f (x)dx.                           (2.3.10)

                                      a                    a                    c

This is a reflection of our intuition that, for an object moving along a straight

line, the change in position from time t = a to time t = b is equal to the change

in position from time t = a to time t = c plus the change in position from time

t = c to time t = b. Although we assumed that [a, c] was divisible into an integer

number of subintervals of length dx, the result holds in general.

The final properties which we will consider revolve around a basic inequality.

If f and g are both continuous on [a, b] with f (x)  g(x) for all x in [a, b], then

                                               N                       N

                                                     f (xi )dx  g(xi )dx,                          (2.3.11)

                                            i=1                     i=1

from which it follows that

                                                     b                    b

                                                        f (x)dx  g(x)dx.                           (2.3.12)

                                                  a                    a

For example, if m and M are constants with m  f (x)  M for all x in [a, b],

then                           b              b                                      b

and so

                                                                   b

Note, in particular, that if f (x)  0 for all x in [a, b], then

                                            b                                              (2.3.15)

Example 2.3.1. From the observation that

                                                     1
                                        f (x) = 1 + x2

is increasing on (-, 0] and decreasing on [0, ), it is easy to see that

                                        1                                1
                                        2  1 + x2  1

for all x in [-1, 1]. Hence

                                          11
                                  -1 1  1 + x2 dx  2.

We will eventually see, in Example 2.6.20, that

                                  11

    Since for any real number a, -|a|  a  |a| (indeed, either a = |a| or

a = -|a|), we have

                                  - |f (x)|  f (x)  |f (x)|                                (2.3.16)

Notice that, since the definite integral is just a generalized version of summation,

this result is a generalization of the triangle inequality: Given any real numbers

a and b,

                                        |a + b|  |a| + |b|.                                (2.3.19)

2.4 The fundamental theorem of integrals

The main theorem of this section is key to understanding the importance of
definite integrals. In particular, we will invoke it in developing new applications
for definite integrals. Moreover, we will use it to verify the fundamental theorem
of calculus.

    We first need some new notation and terminology. Suppose is a nonzero
infinitesimal. Intuitively, is infinitely smaller than any nonzero real number.
One way to express this is to note that for any nonzero real number r,

that is, the ratio of                              0,                 (2.4.1)
                                             r                        (2.4.2)
                          to r is an infinitesimal. Now we also have

                                                   2

                                              = 0,

that is, the ratio of 2 to is an infinitesimal. Intuitively, this means that 2
is infinitely smaller than itself. This is related to a fact about real numbers:
76                                                             CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

For any real number r with 0 < r < 1, r2 is smaller than r. For example, if
r = 0.01, then r2 = 0.0001.

Definition 2.4.1. Given a nonzero hyperreal number , we say another hyper-
real number  is of an order less than if  is an infinitesimal, in which case we

write   o( ).

    In other words, we have

                                                                                      (2.4.3)
                                 o( ) if and only if 0.

Example      2.4.1.  If    is  any   infinitesimal,      than      o(1)  since     =    is  an
                                                                                1

infinitesimal.

Example 2.4.2. If is any nonzero infinitesimal, then 2  o( ) since

                                           2

                                             = 0.

    Now suppose N is a positive infinite integer, = 1N , and i  o( ) for
i = 1, 2, . . . , N . Then, for any positive real number r,

                                           |i| < r,                                   (2.4.4)

and so

                                     N |i|                                            (2.4.5)
                                               < rN.

                                     i=1

Multiplying both sides by , we have

                               N1                                                     (2.4.6)
                                   |i| < rN = rN N = r.

                               i=1

Since this holds for all positive real numbers r, it follows that               i=1 N |i| is an
                                                                                       (2.4.7)
infinitesimal. Now

                                     N            N

                                           i  |i|,

                                     i=1          i=1

and so we may conclude that i=1 n i is an infinitesimal. In words, the sum of
                                           1
N   infinitesimals  of  order  less  than  N  is  still  an  infinitesimal.

    Now suppose B is a function that for any real numbers a < b in an open

interval I assigns a value B(a, b). Moreover, suppose B has the following two

properties:

    · for any a < c < b in I, B(a, b) = B(a, c) + B(c, b), and
2.4. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF INTEGRALS                                      77

      · for some continuous function h and any nonzero infinitesimal dx,

          for any x in I.

For   a   positive  infinite  integer  N,  let  dx  =     b-a  and  let
                                                           N

                              a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xN = b                (2.4.9)

be a partition of [a, b] into N equal intervals of length dx. Then

      B(a, b) = B(x0, x1) + B(x1, x2) + B(x2, x3) + · · · + B(xN-1, xN )

                    N

          = B(xi-1, xi-1 + dx)

                   i=1

                    N

          = ((B(xi-1, xi-1 + dx) - h(xi-1)dx) + h(xi-1)dx)

                   i=1

                    N                                                    N

          = (B(xi-1, xi-1 + dx) - h(xi-1)dx) + h(xi-1)dx

                   i=1                                              i=1

                    N                                                       b

                        (B(xi-1, xi-1 + dx) - h(xi-1)dx) + h(x)dx.             (2.4.10)

                   i=1                                                   a

Since the final sum on the right is the sum of N infinitesimals of order less than

1  ,  it  follows  that
N

                                                       b

                              B(a, b) = h(x)dx.                                (2.4.11)

                                                    a

    This result is basic to understanding both the computation of definite inte-
grals and their applications. We call it the fundamental theorem of integrals.

Theorem 2.4.1. Suppose B is a function that for any real numbers a < b in
an open interval I assigns a value B(a, b) and satisfies

      · for any a < c < b in I, B(a, b) = B(a, c) + B(c, b), and

      · for some continuous function h and any nonzero infinitesimal dx,

          for any x in I.

for any real numbers a and b in I.
78                                                                               CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

    We will look at several applications of definite integrals in the next section.

For now, we note how this theorem provides a method for evaluating integrals.

Namely, given a function f which is differentiable on an open interval I, define,

for every a < b in I,

                                B(a, b) = f (b) - f (a).                                    (2.4.14)

Then, for any a, b, and c in I with a < c < b,

                       B(a, b) = f (b) - f (a)                                              (2.4.15)
                                = (f (b) - f (c)) + (f (c) - f (a))
                                = B(a, c) + B(c, b).

Moreover, for any infinitesimal dx and any x in I,

                   B(x, x + dx) f (x + dx) - f (x)                                          (2.4.16)
                                                         =                          f (x),  (2.4.17)
                       dx                                                 dx

from which it follows that

                                B(x, x + dx) - f (x)dx

                                                            dx

is an infinitesimal. Hence

                             B(x, dx) - f (x)dx  o(dx),                                     (2.4.18)

and so it follows from Theorem 2.4.1 that                                      b            (2.4.19)
                            f (b) - f (a) = B(a, b) =
                                                                                 f (x)dx.
This is the fundamental theorem of calculus.
                                                                              a

Theorem 2.4.2. If f is differentiable on an open interval I, then for every

a < b in I,

                                   f (x)dx = f (b) - f (a).                                 (2.4.20)

                                                            0

we first note that g(x) = x is the derivative of f (x) = 12 x2. Hence, by Theorem

2.4.2,

                          1                                                   1     1

                       0

    We will write

                                f (x)|ab = f (b) - f (a)                                    (2.4.21)

this notation, the previous example becomes

                         x2dx = 1 x3 + c,
                                   3

we have                  x2 2 dx = 1 x3 2 = 8 - 1 = 7 .

         0

Note that if we consider an object moving along a straight line with velocity
v(t) = -20 sin(5t), then this definite integral computes the change in position
of the object from time t = 0 to time t = 2. In this case, the object, although
always in motion, is in the same position at time t = 2 as it was at time t = 2.

2.5 Applications of definite integrals

In this section we will look at several examples of applications for definite inte-
grals.

2.5.1 Area between curves

Consider two continuous functions f and g on an open interval I with f (x) 
g(x) for all x in I. For any a < b in I, let R(a, b) be the region in the plane
consisting of the points (x, y) for which a  x  b and f (x)  y  g(x). That
is, R(a, b) is bounded above by the curve y = g(x), below by the curve y = f (x),
on the left by the vertical line x = a, and on the right by the vertical line x = b,
as in Figure 2.5.1. Let

                         A(a, b) = area of R(a, b).      (2.5.1)

            y                         y = g(x)                         x=b
                                       R(a, b)
                              x=a     y = f (x)

                                   a                                b           x

Figure 2.5.1: Region R(a, b) between the graphs of y = g(x) and y = f (x)

Clearly, for any a  c  b,

                                      A(a, b) = A(a, c) + A(c, b).                 (2.5.2)

    Now for an x in I and a positive infinitesimal dx, let c be the point at which
g(u) - f (u) attains its minimum value for x  u  x + dx and let d be the point
at which g(u) - f (u) attains its maximum value for x  u  x + dx. Then

              (g(c) - f (c))dx  A(x, x + dx)  (g(d) - f (d))dx.                    (2.5.3)

Moreover, since

                 g(c) - f (c)  g(x) - f (x)  g(d) - f (d),                         (2.5.4)

we also have

(g(c) - f (c))dx  (g(x) - f (x))dx  (g(d) - f (d))dx.                              (2.5.5)

Putting (2.5.3) and (2.5.5) together, we have

|A(x, dx) - (g(x) - f (x))dx|  ((g(d) - f (d)) - (f (c) - g(c)))dx (2.5.6)

or                                                                                 (2.5.7)

                         dx

Now since c x and d x,

(g(d) - f (d)) - (g(c) - f (c)) = (g(d) - g(c)) + (f (c) - f (d)) 0. (2.5.8)

x2 = x + 2, that is when

Hence they intersect at the points (-1, 1) and (2, 4), and so R is the region in
the plane bounded above by the curve y = x + 2, below by the curve y = x2, on

the right by x = -1, and on the left by x = 2. See Figure 2.5.2. Thus we have

y = x2.

Exercise 2.5.2.  Find the area of the region bounded by the curves y = x2
and y = 2 - x2.                                                                             

Exercise 2.5.3.  Find the area of the region bounded by the curves y = x
and y = x.

    Now consider a continuous function f on an interval [a, b] with f (x)  0 for
all x in [a, b]. If A is the area of the region R bounded above by the graph of
y = f (x), below by the graph of y = 0 (that is, the x-axis), on the right by the
vertical line x = a, and on the left by the graph of x = b (see Figure 2.5.3), then

                            b        b

                 A = (f (x) - 0)dx = f (x)dx.                           (2.5.11)

This gives us a geometric interpretation for a the definite integral of a nonneg-
ative function f over an interval [a, b] as the area beneath the graph of f and
above the x-axis.

Example 2.5.2. If A is the area of the region R beneath the graph of y = sin(x)
over the interval [0, ], as in Figure 2.5.4, then

                                              

                       A = sin(x)dx = - cos(x)|0 = 1 + 1 = 2.

    On the other hand, if f is continuous on [a, b] with f (x)  0 for all x in
[a, b], and A is the area of the region R above the graph of y = f (x) and below

That is, the definite integral of a non-positive function f over an interval [a, b]

is the negative of the area above the graph of f and beneath the x-axis.

In general, given a continuous function f on an interval let R be the region

bounded by the x-axis and the graph of y = f (x). If A+ is the area of the part

of R which lies above the x-axis and A- is the area of the part of R which lies

below the x-axis, then

                  0

Geometrically, we can see this result in Figure 2.5.5. If R+ is the the region
beneath the graph of y = sin(x) over the interval [0, ] and R- is the region

above the graph of y = sin(x) over the interval [0, 2], then these two regions
have the same area. Hence the integral, which is the area of R+ minus the area
of R-, is 0.

2.5.2 Volumes

Consider a three-dimensional body B. Given a line, which we will call the z-axis,
let V (a, b) be the volume of B which lies between planes which are perpendicular
to the z-axis and pass through z = a and z = b. Clearly, for any a < c < b,

                            V (a, b) = V (a, c) + V (c, b).               (2.5.14)

Now suppose that, for any a  x  b, R(z) is a cross section of B perpendicular
to the z-axis. See Figure 2.5.6. Let A(z) be the area of R(z). We assume A is
a continuous function of z. For a positive infinitesimal dz, let A have, on the
interval [z, z + dz], a minimum value at c and a maximum value at d. Then

                         A(c)dz  V (z, z + dz)  A(d)dz.                   (2.5.15)

Since we also have A(c)  A(z)  A(d), it follows that

                         |V (z, z + dz) - A(z)dz|  (A(d) - A(c))dz.       (2.5.16)

Thus                     |V (z, z + dz) - A(z)dz|
                                                         A(d) - A(c).
                                                                          (2.5.17)

                                      V (a, b) = A(z)dz.

Example 2.5.4. The unit sphere S, with center at the origin, is the set of all
points (x, y, z) satisfying x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 (see Figure 2.5.7). For a fixed value
of z between -1 and 1, the cross section R(z) of S perpendicular to the z-axis
is the set of points (x, y) satisfying the equation x2 + y2 = 1 - z2. That is, R(z)
is a circle with radius 1 - z2. Hence R(z) has area

                                        A(z) = (1 - z2).

perpendicular to the z-axis, then R(z) is a circle with radius z. Thus, if A(z)

2.5.3 Arc length

Consider a function f which is continuous on the closed interval [a, b]. Let C be
the graph of f over [a, b] and let L be the length of C. To approximate L, we
first divide [a, b] into N equal subintervals, each of length

                                  x =   b-a           ,                                            (2.5.20)

                                        N

and let x0 = a, x1, x2, . . . , xN = b be the endpoints of the subintervals. If Li is
the length of the line from (xi-1, f (xi-1)) to (xi, f (xi)), for i = 1, 2, . . . , N (see
Figure 2.5.10), then

                                                                                  N                (2.5.21)

Since

Li = (xi - xi-1)2 + (f (xi) - f (xi-1)2 = (x)2 + (yi)2, (2.5.22)

where          yi = f (xi) - f (xi-1) = f (xi-1 + x) - f (xi-1),                                   (2.5.23)

    Now we should expect the approximation in (2.5.24) to become exact when
N is infinite. That is, for N a positive infinite integer, let

                                         dx =        b-a         ,                                       (2.5.25)

is the same for any choice of N , then we call (2.5.27) the arc length of C. Now
if f is differentiable on an open interval containing [a, b], and f is continuous
on [a, b], then (2.5.27) becomes the definite integral of 1 + (f (x))2. That is,
the arc length of C is given by

                                              b   1 + (f (x))2 dx.                                       (2.5.28)

               = (0.01i)2 - (0.01(i - 1))2
               = 0.0001(i2 - (i2 - 2i + 1))
               = 0.0001(2i - 1)

2.6 Some techniques for evaluating integrals

2.6.1 Change of variable

If F is an integral of f and  is a differentiable function, then, using the chain

rule,

       d                                           (2.6.1)
          F ((x)) = F ((x)) (x) = f ((x)) (x).

       dx

Written in terms of integrals, we have

               f ((x)) (x)dx = F ((x)) + c.        (2.6.2)

If we let u = (x) and note that

               f (u)du = F (u) + c,                (2.6.3)
92                                                        CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

we may express (2.6.2) as

                           f ((x)) (x)dx = f (u)du.                      (2.6.4)

That is, we may evaluate

                            f ((x)) (x)dx,

by changing the variable to u = (x), with  (x)dx becoming du since

                            du
                                =  (x).

                            dx

Example 2.6.1. To evaluate

                            2x 1 + x2 dx,

let

                                              u = 1 + x2
                                            du = 2xdx.

Then                        u du = 2 u 23 + c = 2 (1 + x2) 23 + c.

      2x 1 + x2 dx =        3                             3

Example 2.6.2. To evaluate

                            x sin(x2)dx,

let

                                              u = x2
                                             du = 2xdx

Note that in this case we cannot make a direct substitution of u and du since
du = 2xdx does not appear as part of the integral. However, du differs from
xdx by only a constant factor, and we may rewrite du = 2xdx as

                            1
                             du = xdx.

                            2

Now we may perform the change of variable:

Example 2.6.3. Note that we could evaluate the integral

                                       cos(4x)dx

using the substitution

                                        u = 4x
                                       du = 4dx,

which gives us                           1                    1
                                 1  cos(u)du = sin(u) + c = sin(4x) + c.
                                         4                    4
               cos(4x)dx =
                                 4

However, it is probably quicker, and easier, to guess that the integral of cos(4x)

should be close to sin(4x), and then correcting this guess appropriately after

noting that

                                    d
                                        sin(4x) = 4 cos(4x).

                                    dx

Example 2.6.4. To evaluate

                                    cos2(5x) sin(5x)dx,

let

                                     u = cos(5x)
                                    du = -5 sin(5x)dx.

Then

      cos2(5x) sin(5x)dx = - 1         u2du = - 1 u3 + c = - 1 cos3(5x) + c.
                                    5             15             15

     Now consider the definite integral

                                     b

                                       f ((x)) (x)dx.

                                    a

If F is an integral of f , c = (a), and d = (b), then

              b

                f ((x)) (x)dx = F ((x))|ab

             a

                                     = F ((b)) - F ((a))

                                         = F (d) - F (c)

                                         = F (u)|cd                       (2.6.5)

                                                 d

                                         = f (u)du.

                                               c

That is, we may use a change of variable to evaluate a definite integral in the
same manner as above, the only difference being that we must change the limits
of integration to reflect the values of the new variable u.
94                                                              CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

Example 2.6.5. To evaluate               1x
let                                                      dx,
                                         0 1 + x2

                                          u = 1 + x2
                                         du = 2xdx.

Note that when x = 0, u = 1, and when x = 1, u = 2. Hence

                     1x                  1 21                   2 
                0 1 + x2 dx = 2 1 u du = u 1 = 2 - 1.

Example 2.6.6. To evaluate

                                     

                                   4 cos2(2x) sin(2x)dx,

                                  0

let

                                      u = cos(2x)
                                     du = -2 sin(2x)dx.

Then u = 1 when x = 0 and u = 0 when x = 4 , so

                        4 cos2(2x) sin(2x)dx = - 1 0 u2du.
                                                              21
                     0

Note that, after making the change of variable, the upper limit of integration is
less than the lower limit of integration, a situation not covered by our definition
of the definite integral or our statement of the fundamental theorem of calculus.
However, the result on substitutions above shows that we will obtain the correct
result if we apply the fundamental theorem as usual. Moreover, this points
toward an extension of our definition: if b < a, then we should have

                                  b                      a

                                     f (x)dx = - f (x)dx,                                   (2.6.6)

                               a                      b

which is consistent with both the fundamental theorem of calculus and with the

definition  of  the  definite  integral  (since,  if  b  <  a,  dx  =  b-a  <  0  for  any  positive
                                                                        N

infinite integer N ). With this, we may finish the evaluation:

            4 cos2(2x) sin(2x)dx = - 1 0 u2du = 1 1 u2du = u3 1 = 1 .

2.6.2 Integration by parts

Suppose u and v are both differentiable functions of x. Since, by the product

rule,

                       d        dv du
                           uv = u + v ,                                                        (2.6.7)
                       dx       dx dx

we have                dv d                                                         du

                       u = uv - v .                                                            (2.6.8)
                       dx dx                                                        dx

Hence, integrating both sides with respect to x,

           dv          d          du                                                     du    (2.6.9)
         u dx =           uv -   v = uv -                                               v dx,

           dx          dx         dx                                                     dx

which we may write as

                          udv = uv - vdu.                                                      (2.6.10)

This last formulation, known as integration by parts, is useful whenever the
integral on the right of (2.6.10) is in someway simpler than the integral on the
left. The next examples will illustrate some typical cases.

Example 2.6.7. Consider the integral

                           x cos(x)dx.

If we let u = x and dv = cos(x)dx, then du = dx and we may let v = sin(x).
Note that we have some choice for v since the only requirement is that it is an
integral of cos(x). Using (2.6.10), we have

x sin(x)dx = uv - vdu = x sin(x) - sin(x)dx = x sin(x) + cos(x) + c.

    In evaluating a definite integral using integration by parts, we must remem-
ber to evaluate each piece of the integral. That is,

                                                               b               (2.6.11)

                                 udv = uv|ab - vdu.

Example 2.6.8. To evaluate

                                  

                                    x2 sin(x)dx,

                                 0

let

                u = x2                        dv = sin(x)dx
               du = 2xdx                       v = - cos(x).

Then, using (2.6.11),

                                                                             
          x2 sin(x)dx = -x2 cos(x) 0 + 2x cos(x)dx = 2 + 2x cos(x)dx.
     0                           0                                        0

Note that the final integral is simpler than the integral with which we started,
but still requires another integration by parts to finish the evaluation. Namely,
if we now let

                u = 2x                            dv = cos(x)
               du = 2dx                            v = sin(x),

we have

                                                                     
               x2 sin(x)dx = 2 + 2x sin(x)|0 - 2 sin(x)dx
          0                                                       0

                                 = 2 + (0 - 0) + 2 cos(x)|0

                                 = 2 - 2 - 2

                                 = 2 - 4.

2.6.3 Some integrals involving trigonometric functions

The next examples will illustrate how various identities are useful in simplifying
some integrals involving trigonometric functions.

Example 2.6.10. To evaluate the integral

                                                                 

                                                sin2(x)dx,

we will use the half-angle formula:

               sin2(x) = 1 - cos(2x) .                                                                 (2.6.12)

                                  cos2(x) = 1 + cos(2x) .                       (2.6.13)
                                                      2

As illustrated in the next example, we may use the half-angle formulas recur-

sively to evaluate the integral of any even power of sine or cosine.

Example 2.6.11. Using 2.6.13 twice, we have

                                       cos2(3x) 2 dx

Exercise 2.6.14. Evaluate cos4(x)dx.

    The next example illustrates a reduction formula.

Example 2.6.12. Suppose n  2 is an integer and we wish to evaluate

                                        

                                          sinn(x)dx.

                                       0

We begin with an integration by parts: if we let

                u = sinn-1(x)                                dv = sin(x)dx

              du = (n - 1) sinn-2(x) cos(x)dx                 v = - cos(x),

then

                                                              
           sinn(x)dx = - sinn-1(x) cos(x)  + (n - 1) sinn-2(x) cos2(x)dx

2.6. SOME TECHNIQUES FOR EVALUATING INTEGRALS                      99

Now cos2(x) = 1 - sin2(x), so we have

                               

   sinn(x)dx = (n - 1)           sinn-2(x)(1 - sin2(x))dx

                 = (n - 1)                                 

                                 sinn-2(x)dx - (n - 1) sinn(x)dx.

                            0                           0

Notice that 0 sinn(x)dx occurs on both sides of this equation. Hence we may
solve for this quantity, first obtaining

                                              

            n sinn(x)dx = (n - 1) sinn-2(x)dx,

            0                              0

and then        sinn(x)dx = n - 1  sinn-2(x)dx.

                                       n0                          (2.6.14)

            0

Note that, although we have not yet found the value of our integral, we have
reduced the power of sin(x) in the integral. We may now use (2.6.14) repeatedly
to reduce the power of sin(x) until we can easily evaluate the resulting integral.
For example, if n = 6 we have

                     sin6(x)dx = 5  sin4(x)dx
                                       60

Example 2.6.13. An alternative to using a reduction formula in the last ex-

                                (sin2(x))2 sin(x)dx
                     =

    Our next example relies on a trigonometric identity for sin(ax) cos(bx), where
a and b are both real numbers. We first note that, using the angle addition and
subtraction formulas for sine,

           sin((a + b)x) = sin(ax) cos(bx) + sin(bx) cos(ax)                                  (2.6.15)
           sin((a - b)x) = sin(ax) cos(bx) - sin(bx) cos(bx).                                 (2.6.16)

Adding these together, we have

           2 sin(ax) cos(bx) = sin((a + b)x) + sin((a - b)x),                                 (2.6.17)

and so

                                  1                                                           (2.6.18)
           sin(ax) cos(bx) = (sin((a + b)x) + sin((a - b)x)).

                                  2

                       0

we first note that, using (2.6.18) with a = 2 and b = 3,

                    1                                                                 1

    For integrals involving sin(ax) sin(bx), we begin with the the angle addition
and subtraction formulas for cosine,

          cos((a + b)x) = cos(ax) cos(bx) - sin(bx) sin(ax)          (2.6.19)
          cos((a - b)x) = cos(ax) cos(bx) + sin(bx) sin(bx).         (2.6.20)

Subtracting the first of these from the second, we have

          2 sin(ax) sin(bx) = cos((a - b)x) - cos((a + b)x),         (2.6.21)

and so                                                               (2.6.22)
                                     1

              sin(ax) sin(bx) = (cos((a - b)x) - cos((a + b)x)).
                                     2

                sin(3x) sin(5x)dx,

             0

we first note that, using (2.6.22) with a = 3 and b = 5,

          1                              1
       sin(3x) sin(5x) = (cos(-2x) - cos(8x)) = (cos(2x) - cos(8x)).
          2                              2

Note that we would have the same identity if we had chosen a = 5 and b = 3.

which leads to                                                       (2.6.24)

2.6.4 Change of variable revisited

Suppose f is a continuous function on the interval [a, b] and  is either an
increasing function defined on an interval [c, d] with (c) = a and (d) = b, or
a decreasing function defined on [c, d] with (c) = b and (d) = a. Then, by
(2.6.5), changing the notation as necessary,

                                         b           d

                                            f (x)dx = f ((z)) (z)dz.        (2.6.25)

                                      a           c

Earlier we used (2.6.25) to simplify integrals in the form of the right-hand side; in
this section we will look at some examples which simplify in the other direction.

                                                        
Example 2.6.17. Since the graph of y = 1 - x2 for 0  x  1 is one-quarter
of the circle x2 + y2 = 1 (see Figure 2.6.1), we know that

                                               1 1 - x2dx =  .

                                            0

We will now see how to use a change of variable to evaluate this integral using

the fundamental theorem. The idea is to make use of the trigonometric identity
1 - sin2(z) = cos2(z). That is, suppose we let x = sin(z) for 0  z  2 . Then

1 - x2 = 1 - sin2(z) = cos2(z) = | cos(z)| = cos(z),

where the final equality follows since cos(z)  0 for 0  z  2 . Now
                                          dx = cos(z)dz,

Example 2.6.18. Let C be the circle with equation x2 + y2 = 1 and let L

be the length of the shorter arc of C between - 1 , 1 and 1 , 1 (see

the circumference of C, we should have L = 2 . We will now show that this
agrees with (2.5.28), the formula we derived for computing arc length. Now
y = 1 - x2, so

However, at that point we did not have the means to evaluate this integral. We
now have most, although not all, of the necessary tools. To begin, we will first

make the change of variable

cos2(t)), which is a hint that the change of variable

                                x = tan(z)
                               dx = sec2(z)

might be of use. If we let  be the angle for which tan() = 2, with 0 <  < 2 ,
and note that tan(0) = 0 and

                1 + tan2(z) = sec2(z) = | sec(z)| = sec(z)

(note that sec(z) > 0 since 0  z  2 ), then

                L = 1  sec(z) sec2(z)dz = 1             
                20                              2
                                                          sec3(z)dz.

                                                       0

We may reduce the integral on the right using an integration by parts: Letting

                 u = sec(z)dz                          dv = sec2(z)dx
                du = sec(z) tan(z)dz                    v = tan(z),

we have

                                                   
                sec3(z)dz = sec(z) tan(z)|0 - sec(z) tan2(z)dz
         0                                      0

                                                

                   = sec() tan() - sec(z)(sec2(z) - 1)dz

                                             0

                                                          

                   = 2 5 - sec3(z)dz + sec(z)dz,

                                      0                0

where we haveused the fact that tan() = 2 and 1 + tan2() = sec2(z) to find
that sec() = 5. It now follows that

                                                     

                2 sec3(z)dz = 2 5 + sec(z)dz,

                0                                 0
108                                                    CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

and so                  sec3(z)dz = 5 + 1  sec(z)dz.

                    0                            20

Hence                          5 1 

                          L= +                   sec(z)dz.
                               2 40

For this reduced integral, we notice that

                          sec(z) + tan(z)                  sec2(z) + sec(z) tan(z)

       sec(z)dz = sec(z)  sec(z) + tan(z)     dz =             sec(z) + tan(z)      dz,

0         0                                            0

and so the change of variable

                        w = sec(z) + tan(z)
                       dw = (sec(z) tan(z) + sec2(z))dz

gives us                                         

                                                 2+ 5 1   dw.

                             sec(z)dz =       1      w

                          0

Thus we now have                                 
                                  51
                                              2+ 5 1   dw.
                          L= +
                                 24        1        w

Although greatly simplified from the integral with which we started, neverthe-
less we cannot evaluate the remaining integral with our current tools. Indeed,
we may use the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate, for any rational
number n, any definite integral involving wn, except in the very case we are
facing now, that is, when n = -1. We will fill in this gap in the next section,
and finish this example at that time (see Example 2.7.9).

Example 2.6.20. For a simpler example of the change of variable used in the
previous example, consider the integral

                                11

over the interval [-1, 1] (see Figure 2.6.3). If we let

                                x = tan(z)
                               dx = sec2(z)dz,

2.7 The exponential and logarithm functions

There are many applications in which it is necessary to find a function y of a
variable t which has the property that

                                    dy                              (2.7.1)
                                        = ky

                                    dt

for some constant real number k. Examples include modeling the growth of
certain animal populations, where y is the size of the population at time t and
k > 0 depends on the rate at which the population is growing, and describing
the decay of a radioactive substance, where y is the amount of a radioactive
material present at time t and k < 0 depends on the rate at which the element
decays. We will first consider that case k = 1; that is, we will look for a function
y = f (t) with the property that f (t) = f (t).

2.7.1 The exponential function

Suppose f is a differential function on (-, ) with the property that f (t) =
f (t) for all t (one may show that such a function does indeed exist, although we
will not go into the details here). Now f (t) = f (t) implies, by the fundamental
theorem of calculus, that

        t                              t

           f (x)dx = f (x)dx = f (t) - f (0)                        (2.7.2)

     0                              0

for all t. The value of f (0 is arbitrary; we will find it convenient to take f (0) = 1.
That is, we are now looking for a function f which satisfies

                                                 t                  (2.7.3)

                        f (t) = 1 + f (x)dx.

                                               0

Suppose we divide [0, t] into N subintervals of equal length x = tN , where N is
a positive integer, and let x0, x1, x2, . . . , xN be the endpoints of these intervals.

Now for any i = 1, 2, . . . , N , using (2.7.3),

                                xi

     f (xi) = 1 + f (x)dx

                             0

                                xi-1                 xi

                        =1+               f (x)dx +        f (x)dx

                             0                       x1-1

                                          xi

                        = f (xi-1) +            f (x)dx.            (2.7.4)

                                          x1-1

Moreover, for small x,

                         xi                                         (2.7.5)

                             f (x)dx  f (xi-1)x,

                        x1-1
2.7. THE EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHM FUNCTIONS                                                          111

and so we have

                  f (xi)  f (xi-1) + f (xi-1)x = f (xi-1)(1 + x).                                 (2.7.6)

Hence we have

                        f (x0) = f (0) = 1,                                                        (2.7.7)
                                                                                                   (2.7.8)
                        f (x1)  f (x0)(1 + x) = 1 + x,                                             (2.7.9)
                                                                                                  (2.7.10)
                        f (x2)  f (x1)(1 + x)  (1 + x)2,                                          (2.7.11)

                        f (x3)  f (x2)(1 + x)  (1 + x)3,                                          (2.7.12)
                                                                                                  (2.7.13)
                        f (x4)  f (x3)(1 + x)  (1 + x)4,

                               ...           ...                   ...

                  f (xN )  f (xN-1)(1 + x)  (1 + x)N

Now xN = t and x = tN , so we have

                                         f (t)  1 +    tN       .                                 (2.7.14)

                                                       N

Moreover, if we followed the same procedure with N infinite and dx = tN , we
should expect (although we have not proved)

                                         f (t) 1 +     tN       .                                 (2.7.15)

                                                       N

We will let e = f (1). That is,

                                         e = sh 1 +    1N       ,                                 (2.7.16)

                                                       N

where N is any positive        infinite integer. We call e              Euler's number.   Now if t is
any real number, then                                                                        (2.7.17)
                                          t                  1          N t
                      f (t) =       1+                 1+ N
                                             N                           t
                                         N                      t
                                                =                          = et,

where   we  have  used  the    fact  that    N    is  infinite  since   N   is  infinite  and  t  is  finite.
                                             t
                        N
(Note,  however,  that  t    is     not  an  integer,  as  required     in  (2.7.16).     The  statement

is nevertheless true, but this is a detail which we will not pursue here.) Thus

the function

                                               f (t) = et                                         (2.7.18)

has the property that f (t) = f (t), that is,

                                               d et = et.                                         (2.7.19)

In fact, one may show that f (t) = et is the only function for which f (0) = 1
and f (t) = f (t). We call this function the exponential function, and sometimes
write exp(t) for et.

    It has been shown that e is an irrational number. Although, like , we
may not express e exactly in decimal notation, we may use (2.7.16) to find
approximations, replacing the infinite N with a large finite value for N . For
example, with N = 200, 000, we find that

     e 1+  1 200000   2.71828,                                        (2.7.20)

           200000

which is correct to 5 decimal places.

Example 2.7.1. If f (t) = e5t, then f is the composition of h(t) = 5t and
g(u) = eu. Hence, using the chain rule,

                            f (t) = g (h(t))h (t) = e5t · 5 = 5e5t.

     In general, if h(t) is differentiable, then, by the chain rule,

                                        d eh(t) = h (t)eh(t).         (2.7.21)

Example 2.7.2. If f (x) = 6e-x2 , then
                                       f (x) = -12xe-x2 .

Exercise 2.7.1. Find the derivative of g(x) = 12e-7x.

Exercise 2.7.2. Find the derivative of f (t) = 3t2e-t.

Example 2.7.3. Let f (t) = et and g(t) = e-t. Since et > 0 for all t, we
have f (t) = et > 0 and f (t) = et > 0 for all t, and so f is increasing on
(-, ) and the graph of f is concave upward on (-, ). On the other
hand, g (t) = -e-t < 0 and g (t) = e-t > 0 for all t, so g is decreasing on
(-, ) and the graph of g is concave upward on (-, ). See Figure 2.7.1.

    Of course, it follows from (2.7.19) that

           etdt = et + c.                                             (2.7.22)

                            dt

That is, y satisfies the differential equation (2.7.1) with which we began this
section. We will consider example applications of this equation after a discussion
of the logarithm function, the inverse of the exponential function.

2.7.2 The logarithm function

The logarithm function is the inverse of the exponential function. That is, for

a positive real number x, y = log(x), read y is the logarithm of x, if and only if
ey = x. In particular, note that for any positive real number x,

                            elog(x) = x,                           (2.7.24)

and for any real number x,

                            log (ex) = x.                          (2.7.25)

Also, since e0 = 1, it follows that log(1) = 0.
    Since log(x) is the power to which one must raise e in order to obtain x,

logarithms inherit their basic properties from the properties of exponents. For
example, for any positive real numbers x and y,

                            log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)              (2.7.26)

since

       elog(x)+log(y) = elog(x)elog(y) = xy.                       (2.7.27)
                                                                   (2.7.28)
Similarly, for any positive real number x and any real number a,

                            log (xa) = a log(x)

since                                      a

       ea log(x) = elog(x) = xa.                                   (2.7.29)

Exercise 2.7.6. Verify that for any positive real numbers x and y,

       log                       x     = log(x) - log(y).               (2.7.30)

                                 y

Note in particular that this implies that

                             log       1  = - log(y).                   (2.7.31)

                                       y

To find the derivative of the logarithm function, we first note that if y =

log(x), then ey = x, and so

                                    d ey = d x.                         (2.7.32)
                                    dx     dx

Applying the chain rule, it follows that

                                       ey dy = 1.                       (2.7.33)
                                          dx                            (2.7.34)

Hence

                                    dy 1 1
                                    dx = ey = x .

                                    d              1
                                       log(x) = .                       (2.7.35)
                                 dx                x

                                 d         1
                                    log(x) = > 0

ward on (0, ). See Figure 2.7.2.

    Using the fundamental theorem of calculus, it now follows that, for any

x > 0,                 x1 x
                           dt = log(t)|1 = log(x) - log(1) = log(x).
                                                                                           (2.7.36)
                      1t

This provides a geometric interpretation of log(x) as the area under the graph

of  y  =  1  from  1  to  x.  For     example,  log(10)  is  the  area  under  the  graph  of   y  =  1
          t                                                                                           t

from 1 to 10 (see Figure 2.7.3).

Example 2.7.9. We may now complete the example, discussed in Example

2.5.8 and continued in Example 2.6.19, of finding the length L of the graph of
y = x2 over the interval [0, 1]. In those examples we found that

                                   1                                    
                                         1 + 4x2dx = 5 + 1           2+ 5 1
                      L=                                                     dw.
                                                           24             w

Now we see that

                              
                             2+ 5 1             2+5 
                                         dw = log(w)|1 = log(2 + 5),
                          1           w

and so                                      5 1 
                                      L = + log(2 + 5).

                                             24

Rounding to four decimal places, this gives us L  1.4789, the same approxi-
mation we obtained in Example 2.5.8. Note, however, the advantage of having
an exact expression for the answer: We may use the exact expression to easily
approximate L to however many digits we desire, whereas we are unsure of the

Moreover, our procedure for finding the exact expression for L may be extended
easily to find an expression for the length of any segment of the parabola y = x2.

    It is now possible to extend the power rule for differentiating xn. Suppose
n = 0 is a real number and note that, for x > 0,

                          xn = elog(xn) = en log(x).                                   (2.7.37)

Then

                    d xn = d en log(x)
                    dx                                         dx

                          = en log(x) d n log(x)
                                       dx

                          = n en log(x)
                             x

                          = n xn

                          = nxn-1.                                                     (2.7.38)

Thus we have our final form of the power rule.

2.7.3 Some applications

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, there are many applications in

which one desires to find a function y which, for some constant k, satisfies the

differential equation

                         dy                                 (2.7.40)
                             = ky.

                         dt

Such an equation arises whenever the desired quantity grows, or decreases, at a

rate which is proportional to its current value. As we saw above, a function of

the form

                         y = ekt                            (2.7.41)

satisfies this equation for any real constant . Moreover, it may be shown that
any solution must be of this form.

    For example, (2.7.40) is used to model radioactive decay. That is, if one
begins with y0 grams of a radioactive element and y is the amount of the element
which remains after t years, then there is some constant k (which depends on
the particular element being considered) for which

                                              dy            (2.7.42)
                                                  = ky.     (2.7.43)

                                              dt
It follows that, for some real number ,

                                              y = ekt.

Since we are given that y = y0 when t = 0, it follows that  (2.7.44)
                                      y0 = y(0) = e0 = .

Hence

                         y = y0ekt.                         (2.7.45)

Now suppose t1 < t2 are such that y at time t2 is one-half of y at time t1.

Then                   1 y0ekt1 = y0ekt2 .
                       2
                                                            (2.7.46)
120                                                    CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

Thus

                            ekt1 = 2ekt2 ,                              (2.7.47)

and so                               ekt1  k(t1 -t2 )                   (2.7.48)
Hence                       2 = ekt2 = e .                              (2.7.49)

                       log(2) = log ek(t1-t2) = k(t1 - t2),

from which it follows that

                                           log(2)                       (2.7.50)
                            t2 - t1 = - k .

Note that the right-hand side of (2.7.50) does not depend on t1, and so the time
required for one-half of a radioactive element to decay does not depend on the
initial amount of the element. We call this time the half-life of the element.

    Typically the rate of decay of a radioactive element is expressed in terms of
its half-life. From (2.7.50), we see that if the half-life of a particular element is
T , then the decay rate of the element is

                                             log 2                      (2.7.51)
                                     k=- .

                                               T

Example 2.7.14. Carbon-14 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of
carbon with a half-life of 5730 years. A living organism will maintain constant
levels of carbon-14, which will begin to decay once the organism dies and is
buried. Because of this, the amount of carbon-14 in the remains of an organism
may be used to estimate its age. For example, suppose a piece of wood found
buried at an archaeological site has 14% of its original carbon-14. If T is the
number of years since the wood was buried and y0 is the original amount of
carbon-14 in the wood, then

                            0.14y0 = y0ekT ,

where, from (2.7.51),

                            k=-            log(2)   .

                                           5730

It follows that 0.14 = ekT , and so

                            kT = log(0.14).

Thus        log(0.14) 5730 log(0.14)

        T=             k    =-             log(2)       16, 253 years.

Exercise 2.7.15. Suppose a piece of wood buried at an archaeological site has
23% of its original carbon-14. For how many years has the wood been buried?

Exercise 2.7.16. Suppose a radioactive element has a half-life of 24, 065 years.
How many years will it take for a given sample to decay to the point that only
10% of the original amount remains?

    The differential equation (2.7.40) also serves in some situations as a simple
model for population growth. Suppose, for example, that y is the size of a
population of a certain species of animal over a specified habitat. In the absence
of any extraneous limits on the size of the population (such as a limitation on
the food supply), we would expect the rate of growth of the population to be
proportional to the current population; that is, we would expect y to satisfy
(2.7.40) for some constant k. In particular, if y0 is the size of the population at
some initial time and y is the size of the population t year later, then

                                 y = y0ekt.                         (2.7.52)

Now suppose we know the population is y1 at some time t1 > 0. Then

                           y1 = y0ekt1 ,                            (2.7.53)

and so, after dividing through by y0 and taking the logarithm of both sides,

                           k = 1 log y1 .                           (2.7.54)
                                 t1    y0

Example 2.7.15. Suppose that a certain habitat initially holds a population
of 1000 deer, and that five years later the population has grown to 1200 deer. If
we let y be the size of the population after t years, and assuming no constraints
on the growth of the population, we would have

                           y = 1000ekt,

where                   1        1200 log(1.2)

                        k = log        =          .
                        5        1000        5

Then, for example, this model would predict a population of

                        y(10) = 1000e10k
                               = 1000e2 log(1.2)
                               = 1000elog(1.22)
                               = (1000)(1.2)2
                               = 1440 deer

after five more years.

If y is the size of a population of animals, we call the differential equation

                                 dy                                 (2.7.55)
                                     = ky,

                                 dt
122                                                            CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

and the resulting solution,

                                            y = y0ekt,                                       (2.7.56)

the natural growth model . Although often relatively accurate over small time

intervals, this model is clearly unrealistic for any extended period of time as it

predicts an unbounded growth. Even in the best of situations, other factors,

such as availability of food and shelter, will eventually come into play.

     The logistic model introduces a variation in the basic model (2.7.40) which

factors in the limiting effect of space and food. In this case, we suppose that

there is an upper bound, say M , to the size of the population which the habitat

can sustain and that the rate of growth of the population decreases as the size

of the population approaches this limiting value. More precisely, let k be the

natural rate of growth of the population, that is, the rate of growth if there are

no constraining factors, or when the size of the population is small compared

with M , and let y be the size of the population at time t. Then we suppose k is

decreased    by  a  factor  of  1  -  y  ,  that  is,  the  proportion  of  room  left  for  growth.
                                      M

The resulting differential equation for the logistic model is

             dy                    y        k
                    = ky 1 - = y(M - y) = y(M - y),                                          (2.7.57)
             dt                    MM

where  = kM .
    To solve (2.7.57), we first rewrite it using s for the independent variable,

that is, as

                                         dy                                                  (2.7.58)
                                             = y(M - y),

                                         ds

and then divide through both sides by y(M - y) to obtain

                                              1 dy                                           (2.7.59)
                                                          = .

                                         y(M - y) ds

Next, we integrate both sides of this equation from 0 to some fixed time t:

                                   t 1 dy                      t

                                   0 y(M - y) ds       ds = ds.                              (2.7.60)

                                                            0

For the right hand side of (2.7.60), we have simply

                                                                  t                          (2.7.61)

                                                ds = t.

                                                                 0

For the left-hand side, we begin with the change of variable

                                            u=y

                                                   dy                                        (2.7.62)
                                            du = ds,                                         (2.7.63)

                                                   ds

from which we obtain

                            t 1 dy                ds =      y1          du,

                            0 y(M - y) ds               y0 u(M - u)
2.7. THE EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHM FUNCTIONS                                123

where we have again used y0 to denote the size of the population at time s = 0
(and noting that y is the size of the population when s = t). We assume that
0 < y0 < M and 0 < y < M ; that is, we assume that the populations involved
are positive and do not exceed the maximum sustainable population.

    To evaluate (2.7.63), we rely upon a result involving what are known as
partial fraction decompositions: There exist real numbers A and B such that

                                 1         AB
                                          =+           .               (2.7.64)
                     u(M - u) u M - u

To find A and B, we note that (2.7.64) implies that

        1  =       A(M - u)      +        Bu     =  A(M - u) + Bu   .  (2.7.65)

        u(M - u) u(M - u) u(M - u)                     u(M - u)

It follows that, for all values of u,

                           1 = A(M - u) + Bu.                          (2.7.66)

In particular, when u = 0 we have 1 = AM , and when u = M we have 1 = BM .

Hence                                  1            1

                           A = and B = ,                               (2.7.67)
                                       M            M

and so                     1               11 1 1

                                       =      +           .            (2.7.68)
                     u(M - u) M u M M - u

Hence we now have

        y1           du =     1        y1  du +  1   y1
                                                                du
        y0 u(M - u)        M        y0 u         M
                                                    y0 M - u

                              1 y1 y
                     = log(u) - log(M - u)
                           M               y0 M
                                                             y0

                         1
                     = M (log(y) - log(y0) - log(M - y)

                                       + log(M - y0))

                     = 1 log y(M - y0) .                               (2.7.69)
                           M               y0(M - y)

Combining (2.7.60), (2.7.61), and (2.7.69), we have

                     M t = log y(M - y0) ,                             (2.7.70)
                                      y0(M - y)

which now need to solve for y. To begin, exponentiate both sides to obtain

                              eMt = y(M - y0) .                        (2.7.71)
                                        y0(M - y)
124                                               CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

It follows that

        y(M - y0) = eMty0(M - y) = y0M eMt - y0yeMt,            (2.7.72)

and so

      y0M eMt = y(M - y0) + y0yeMt = (M + y0(eMt - 1))y.        (2.7.73)

Thus                                 y0M eMt

                 y=                  Mt .                       (2.7.74)
                     (M + y0(e - 1))

If we divide the numerator and denominator of the right-hand side by eMt, we

have                                y0M
                 y = M e-Mt + y0 - y0e-Mt ,
                                                                (2.7.75)

from which we obtain our final form

                 y=                  y0M          -Mt .         (2.7.76)

                     y0 + (M - y0)e

Note that when t = 0, (2.7.76) reduces to y = y0, as it should given our initial
condition, and when t is infinite, e-Mt 0, and so y = M . Hence y0  y < M

for all t, with y approaching M as t grows.
    Recalling that  = kM , where k is the natural rate of growth of the popula-

tion, we may rewrite (2.7.76) as

                 y=                  y0M          -kt .         (2.7.77)

                     y0 + (M - y0)e

Example 2.7.16. In our previous example, where y represented the number of
deer in a certain habitat after t years, we found

                     k=              log(1.2)  .

                                     5

Now suppose the habitat can support no more than 20, 000 deer.  Then the
logistic model would give us

                 (1000)(20000)                           20000
                 z = 1000 + (20000 - 1000)ekt = 1 + 19e-kt

for the number of deer after t years. After ten years, this model would predict

a population of

                                20000
                 z(10) = 1 + 19e-10k  1409 deer,

only slightly less than the 1440 predicted by the natural growth model. However,

the differences between the two models become more pronounced with time. For

example, after forty years, the natural growth model predicts

                 y(40) = 1000e40k  4300 deer,

                              z(40) = 1 + 19e-40k  3691 deer
and in 100 years, the natural growth model predicts

                              y(100) = 1000e100k  38338deer,

while the logistic model predicts only
                                             20000

                           z(100) = 1 + 19e-100k  13373 deer.
Of course, over time the natural growth model predicts a population which grows
without any bound, whereas the logistic model predicts that the population,
while always increasing, will never surpass 20, 000. See Figure 2.7.4.

Exercise 2.7.17. Suppose a certain population of otters grows from 500 to
600 in 4 years. Using a natural growth model, predict how many years it will
take for the population to double.

Exercise 2.7.18. Suppose habitat of the otters in the previous exercise can
support no more than 1500 otters. Using a logistic model, and the natural rate
of growth found in the previous exercise, predict how many years it will take
for the population to double.

    In evaluating (2.7.63) we made use of a partial fraction decomposition. More
generally, suppose p and q are polynomials, the degree of p is less than the degree
126                                                        CHAPTER 2. INTEGRALS

of q, and q factors completely into distinct linear factors, say,

                   q(x) = (a1x + b1)(a2x + b2) · · · (anx + bn).       (2.7.78)

Then it may be shown that there exist consants A1, A2, . . . , An for which

                 p(x) = A1 + A2 + · · · + An .                         (2.7.79)

for any real numbers a and b for which q(x) = 0 for all x in [a, b], then follows
easily.

Example 2.7.17. To evaluate

                                        1x
                                       0 x2 - 4 dx,

we first note that, since x2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2), there exist constants A and B

for which                        x          A           B

                              x2 - 4 = x - 2 + x + 2 .

It follows that        x               A(x + 2) + B(x - 2)

                       x2 - 4 =                x2 - 4 ,

and so

                       x = A(x + 2) + B(x - 2)

for all values of x. In particular, when x = 2 we have 2 = 4A, and when x = -2

we  have  -2  =  -4B.  Hence  A  =  1  and  B  =  12 ,  and  so
                                    2

                              x        11 11
                       x2 - 4 = 2 x - 2 + 2 x + 2 .

And so we have

                   1x               111                 111
                 0 x2 - 4 dx = 2 0 x - 2 dx + 2 0 x + 2 dx.

     Now      111                              11

                                 1
                       dx = log(x + 2) = (log(3) - log(2)),
              2 0 x+2            2             02

but the first integral requires a bit more care because x - 2 < 0 for 0  x  1.

If we make the change of variables,

                                     u = -(x - 2)
                                    du = -dx,
2.7. THE EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHM FUNCTIONS                              127

then, since x - 2 = -u,

                         111      dx =  1 11     du

                         2 0 x-2        22u

                                  =-    1 21     du

                                        12
                                  = - log(u)
                                        2
                                                     1

                                       1
                                  = - log(2).

                                       2

Hence
