1.3-1.5: Percents, Rates and Proportions and Problem Solving - SOLUTIONS

Group Activity

1. Would you rather...

a. Write down any assumptions you make.

Note: Yours will be different and that's great!

How many hours do you work a week? Say 40

How many meals are served per hour? How much to you make in tips per hour?

b. Write down any additional information you use.

I compared using one week.

c. Write down your mathematical analysis.

Restaurant A: $18 * 40 hours = $720 per week

Restaurant B: $10.50 * 40 hours = 420 per week,

$720 - $420 = $300 so they would need to make over 300 in tips.

$300/40 hours = $7.50 an hour. It seems like the tips would be higher than that
so I choose Restaurant B.

Did anyone find a scenario where Restaurant A is better?

Your group may have had better information about how many tips to expect and
calculated it that way.

Now I realize I could have done $18-10.50 = $7.50 per hour

Absolute and Relative Change

Absolute change is the difference in two quantities and has the same units as the original
quantities.
Relative change is the absolute change and is written as a percentage increase or decrease.

                                       starting quantity

The starting quantity is called the base of the percent change.

5. A laptop that usually sells for $1599.99 is on sale for $1349.99. What is the relative change
    in the cost? This sale is in Oregon so there is no sales tax.

    Absolute change = $1599.99 - 1349.99 = $250 or -$250.

    Relative change = $ = 0.156 or 15.6%. (Negative answers are fine, too)

                                     $.

    The laptop price decreased by 15.6% or about 16%.

6. The U.S. federal debt at the end of 2021 was $28.39 trillion, and grew to $30.84 trillion by
    the end of 2022. At the end of 2005 it was $7.91 trillion, and grew to $8.45 trillion by the
    end of 20061. Calculate the absolute and relative changes for 2005-2006 and 2021-2022.
    Which year saw a larger absolute change and relative change in the federal debt?

    2005-06: Absolute change = $8.45 - 7.91 trillion = $0.54 trillion

    2021-22: Absolute change = $30.84 - 28.39 trillion = $2.45 trillion

    2005-06: Relative change = $. trillion = 0.068 or 6.8%.

                                                     $. trillion

    2021-22: Relative change = $. trillion = 0.086 or 8.6%.

                                                     $. trillion

    The US federal debt increased by 6.8% from 2005-06 and it increased by 8.6% from
    2021-22.

                                           1.4: Rates and Proportions

7. List 3 things in life that are generally proportional and 3 things that are not generally
    proportional.

Unit Rates

8. Would you rather buy a box of aluminum foil with 50 square feet for $2.99 or 75 square
    feet for $3.99? Find the unit price of each and explain your reasoning.

    Small box unit price: $. = $0.0598 per square foot or 5.98 ¢ per square foot.

                                           sq. ft.

    Large box unit price: $. = $0.0532 per square foot or 5.32 ¢ per square foot.

                                           sq. ft.

    I would choose the larger box because I know I will use it eventually. Some people
    may choose the smaller box because they are close and they prefer to save the
    dollar for something else.

Solving Proportion Problems

Use any method to solve these problems. Show your steps so we can follow your thinking.

9. Thai made $87,000 in gross income last year and paid $15,051 in taxes. If tax rates are
    proportional, how much should someone who makes $1,000,000 pay? Do you think tax
    rates are proportional?

Unit rate method: 15051/87000 = .173 or 17.3% tax rate

1000000(.173) = $173,000.

Equation method:

 = 
 
15051(1000000) = x(87000)

x = 15051(1000000)/87000

x = $173,000.

10. A crepe recipe calls for 2 eggs, 3/4 cup of flour and 1 cup of milk. How much flour would
    you need if you use 5 eggs?

Visual method

1 egg          1 egg

¾ cups of flour

1 egg          1 egg 1 egg   1 egg 1 egg

¾ cups of flour            ¾ cups of flour ½ of ¾ cups of flour

¾ + ¾ + half of 3/4 c. or

1 and 7/8 cups or

1 cup + ½ cup + ¼ cup + ½ of a ¼ cup or 2T,

1 cup + ¾ cup + 2T

1.875 cups but this is not as useful for cooking

Unit rate method: ¾ /2 = ¾ * ½ = 3/8 cup per egg.
3/8 * 5/1 = 15/8.

8/8 is 1 cup, 6/8 is ¾ cup and 1/8 or 2 T.

Equation method:
/ = 

  
¾(5) = x(2)
x = 15/4 ÷ 2 or 15/4 * ½ = 15/8 cups

Problems with unit conversions

You can use the internet to look up any conversions you need. Please write down the
conversions you use.

11. Would you Rather 500 pounds of pennies or 40 pounds of quarters?

a. Write down any assumptions you make.

b. Write down any additional information you use. This site can help: Coin Specifications.

    Penny weight is 2.5 g from the website.
    Quarter weight is 5.670 g from the website.
    How many grams in a pound? 453.592 grams in 1 pound from Google.

c. Write down your mathematical analysis.

    There are many ways to do this. It's great if your way is different!
    Pennies: 500 pounds = 500(453.592) = 226796 grams of pennies
    226796 g ÷ 2.5 g = 90718.4 pennies, round to 90718 pennies. Pennies are 1 cent.
    90718(.01) = $907.18 approximately.

Quarters: 40 pounds = 40(453.592) = 18146.68 grams of quarters
18146.68 g ÷ 5.67 g = 3199.94 quarters, round to 3200. Quarters are 25 cents.
3200(.25) = $800 approximately.

d. Write out your conclusion with reasoning.

    I would rather have 500 pounds of pennies because the pennies are worth more
    than 40 pounds of quarters.

Note: This is based on a true story. Did you get the same answer for the pennies as listed in the
article? If not, why do you think they are different?

The article says 500 pounds of pennies were worth $816 and he had 81,600. Why is
this different?

Note: The material that pennies are made from changed in 1983. Pennies minted in
1982 or before weigh 3.11 grams. They decreased the amount of copper to make them
cheaper.

If they were all heavier pennies, how much would they be worth?

226796 g ÷ 3.11 g = 72924.8 pennies, round to 72925 pennies. Pennies are 1
cent.
72925(.01) = $729.25 approximately.

Knowing that there is a mixture of pennies out there, which would you choose?

12. Painting a wall rates - scaling a ratio. Sally can paint a 10x10 foot wall in 2 hours. At the
    same rate, how long would it take her to paint a 30x8 foot wall? Do you think the rates
    would be the same? What are some factors that would affect this?

Find the rate in square foot per hour: 10x10 = 100 square feet

100 sq. ft. ÷ 2 hours = 50 sq. ft. per hour.

Area of the larger wall: 30x8 = 240 sq. ft.

240 sq. ft. ÷ 50 sq. ft. per hour = 4.8 hours

If you want to answer in hours and minutes:

.8 hours (60 min/hour) = 48 minutes

It would take 4.8 hours or 4 hours and 48 minutes to paint at the same rate.

I don't think the rates would be exactly the same because it depends on how much
trim, doors and windows. It takes longer to do the edging than the middle.

13. A very veggie pizza at Pizzicato is available in 3 sizes with the prices shown in the table
    below. Are these prices proportional to the amount of pizza? If not, which is the best deal?
    Which is the worst deal?

Size             Price
Small, 10-inch   $16.00
Medium, 12-inch  $21.25
Large, 16-inch   $30.50

Find the price per square inch:

Area of 10-inch: () = 78.54 sq. inches
$16 ÷ 78.54 = $0.2037 per square inch

Area of 12-inch: () = 113.10 sq. inches
$21.25 ÷ 113.10 = $0.1879 per square inch

Area of 16-inch: () = 201.06 sq. inches
$30.50 ÷ 201.06 = $0.1517 per square inch

The largest size is the better deal per square inch if you need that much pizza.
The prices are not proportional because they do not have the same unit price.
