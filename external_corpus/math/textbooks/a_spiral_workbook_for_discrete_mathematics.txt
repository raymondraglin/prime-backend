About the Book

A Spiral Workbook for Discrete Mathematics covers the standard topics in a sophomore-level
course in discrete mathematics: logic, sets, proof techniques, basic number theory, functions,
relations, and elementary combinatorics, with an emphasis on motivation. The text explains and
clarifies the unwritten conventions in mathematics, and guides the students through a detailed
discussion on how a proof is revised from its draft to a final polished form. Hands-on exercises
help students understand a concept soon after learning it. The text adopts a spiral approach:
many topics are revisited multiple times, sometimes from a different perspective or at a higher
level of complexity, in order to slowly develop the student's problem-solving and writing skills.

Preface

There are many discrete mathematics textbooks available, so why did I decide to invest my time
and energy to work on something that perhaps only I myself would appreciate?

    Mathematical writings are full of jargon and conventions that, without proper guidance, are
difficult for beginners to follow. In the past, students were expected to pick them up along the
way on their own. Those who failed to do so would be left behind. Looking back, I consider
myself lucky. It was by God's grace that I survived all those years. Now, when I teach a
mathematical concept, I discuss its motivation, explain why it is important, and provide a lot
of examples. I dissect the proofs thoroughly to make sure everyone understands them. In brief,
I want to show my students how to analyze mathematical problems.

    Most textbooks typically hide all these details. They only show you the final polished
products. By training, mathematicians love short and elegant proofs. This is reflected in their
own writing. Yes, the results are beautiful, but it is a mystery how mathematicians come up
with such ideas. I want a textbook that discusses mathematical concepts in greater detail. I
want to teach my students how to read and write mathematical arguments. Since I could not
find a textbook that suited my needs, I started writing lecture notes to supplement the main
text. Margin notes, hands-on exercises, summaries, and section exercises were subsequently
added at different stages. The lecture notes have evolved into a full-length text.

    Discrete mathematics is a rich subject, full of many interesting topics. Often, it is taught to
both mathematics and computer science majors. Due to the limit in space, this text addresses
mainly the needs of mathematics majors. Consequently, we will concentrate on logic and proof
techniques, and apply them to sets, basic number theory, and functions. In the last two chapters,
we discuss relations and combinatorics, as many students will find them useful in other courses.

    Since the intended audience of the text is mathematics majors, I use a number of examples
from calculus. By design, I hope this can help students review what they have learned, and see
that discrete mathematics forms the foundation of many mathematical arguments.

    Discrete mathematics is often a required course in computer science. I find it hard and
unjust to serve two different groups of students in the same textbook. Although this text could
be used in a typical first semester discrete mathematics class for the computer science majors,
they need to consult another text for the second semester course.

    Why do I call this a workbook? There are many hands-on exercises designed to help students
understand a new concept before they move on to the next. I believe the title Workbook reflects
the nature of the book, because I expect the students to work on the hands-on exercises. But
why spiral? Because the pedagogy is inspired by the spiral method. The idea is to revisit
some themes and results several times throughout the course and each time further deepen your
understanding. You will find some problems pop up more than once, and they are solved in a
different way each time. In other instances, a concept you learned earlier will be viewed from a
new perspective, thus adding a new dimension to it.

    I am indebted to the anonymous reviewers, whose numerous valuable comments helped to
shape the workbook in its current form. I would also like to express my great appreciation to
Scott Richmond of Reed Library at the State University of New York at Fredonia, who provided
many helpful suggestions and editorial assistance for the first edition.

    In this edition (the second edition), many errors and misprints have been corrected. Slight
revisions are introduced. The major change is the addition of a new chapter on preliminary
vi  Preface

materials to prepare students for a standard course in Discrete Mathematics. More importantly,
the revisions adhere to the spirit of the spiral approach we use in the text. In many proofs, an
overview is added at the beginning to pinpoint the assumption and the goal of the proof. This
should help the students in developing the habit of devising a plan before writing up a proof.

    I would like to express my gratitude to Carrie Green of State University of New York at
Geneseo for her careful reading of the chapter on preliminary materials. Her comments and
suggests greatly improve the exposition.

    The reason I developed this workbook is to help students learn discrete mathematics. If this
workbook proves to be a failure, I am the one to blame. If you find this workbook serves its
intended purposes, I give all the glory to God, in whom I believe and trust.

0.1 Remarks on Notations                                                                              +, -, ·, and / are
                                                                                                      binary operations.
Let us start with something really basic, so much so that we seldom give it a second thought,         The operands must
and yet is is often misused in one way or another. Understanding its real meaning reminds us          be compatible with
how to use it properly.                                                                               the operation.

    What we are talking about are the arithmetic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication     Compatibility is
and division. They are denoted by +, -, · and /, respectively. Our first remark is: they are          what really counts!
binary operators. This means each of them works on two quantities. Consequently, the phrase
"3 + " is an incomplete sentence, because we need another number to complete the computation.

    Another remark is: what appear before and after a binary operator must be compatible.
We call them operands. Saying "3 + orange" does not make any sense. Furthermore, the two
operands must be compatible with the operation as well. For instance, "orange + apple" is
absurd, as we can only add numbers.

    Sounds trivial, right? Unfortunately, many students misuse operators in their writing, as in

    · I do not want to buy a large car, because I do not need it, + I cannot afford it.
    · I always order my hamburger - pickles.

While their meanings are obvious, and they may look cute to some people, such usage is un-
acceptable in formal writing. Sure, you can use them in your drafts, but never use them in
the final versions of the homework assignments that you turn in. Writing mathematics is very
much like writing an English essay. In any essay, beside its content, you have to pay atten-
tion to grammar and punctuation. Likewise, symbols and notations must be used correctly in
mathematical writing.

                 Use mathematical notations to describe mathematical concepts only.

Now, do you understand why we should not write "Tom + Jerry" in formal writing? Instead,
we should spell it out clearly, as in "Tom and Jerry."

    Let me reiterate: make sure that the two operands are compatible with the operation. This
may sound silly at this moment, but you will see very soon the significance of this trivial
discussion. In fact, those of you who have some experience in computer programming can attest
to it. For many operations to work, the two operands must be of the same data type. This is
exactly what we call compatibility.

    You may ask, while we cannot say or write, for instance, " × 7" or "/5," it is perfectly safe to
write "+6" or "-7." Why? What is going on? The truth is, the notations + and - in these two
instances are unary operators. They work on one operand only. In these two examples, they
mean positive six and negative seven, respectively. Of course, we usually just write 6 instead of
+6, but we do need to include the minus sign - to denote the negative number -6. However, the
same minus sign in "-6" and "3 - 4" carries different meanings. One means negative, the other
                 2                                                                         Chapter 0 Preliminaries

-3 should be     subtract or minus. On a calculator, there is a separate button +/- or ( - ) for changing the
pronounced as
negative three.  sign of a number. This is exactly what the unary operator - does.
                     This brings up another remark. Many notations in mathematics carry multiple meanings;

                 their proper meanings depend on the context. For instance, the notation (1, 3) could mean the
                 interval (1, 3) on the real number line, but it could also mean the point (1, 3) on the xy-plane.
                 To avoid confusion, do not merely say, for example, "consider (1, 3)." Instead, say specifically
                 "consider the interval (1, 3)," or "consider the point (1, 3)." In this regard, we urge you to
                 pronounce -3 as "negative three" instead of "minus three."

                     Take heed of this useful advice:

                                                     Don't overuse parentheses.

                 Take the expression

                                                               (5a)((2x)y + 7z)2

                 as an illustration. Not only does it look complicated, it could be misread, hence leading to
                 mistakes that could be easily avoided if we simplify it to

                                                               5a(2xy + 7z)2.

                 Many students hesitate to remove redundant parentheses because they worry about making
                 mistakes in the simplification. They do not realize that an overuse of parentheses could lead to

                     · mismatches of left and right parentheses, which produce notational errors, or
                     · confusion which eventually causes errors in the later steps.

                 All of you can simplify such expressions, you just need some practice. The more you try, the
                 more comfortable you will be.

                 Example 0.1.1 Of course, in some occasions, we do need to use parentheses. In the expression

                                                                    x + y/z,

                 we have two operations: an addition and a division. Remember that we must carry out multi-
                 plication and division before addition and subtraction. Therefore, x + y/z means x + zy . If we
                 want to override the order of operations, we have to insert a pair of parentheses. For example,
                 (x + y)/z means z x+y .

                 Hands-On Exercise 0.1.1 Can you tell the difference between x · y + z and x(y + z)?

                 Example 0.1.2  In       a  similar  way,  if  you  want  to  write  the   reciprocal  of  n + 1,  write  it  as    1
                                                                                                                                  n+1

                 or 1/(n + 1). Do not, however, write it as 1/n + 1, because this means 1n + 1. You may say
                 that you always interpret 1/n + 1 as n+1 1 . But this is not what others will say. Anyone with

                 a sound mathematics background will tell you, because multiplication and division should be

                 done  before  addition  and  subtraction,     1/n + 1  means  1     + 1.
                                                                               n

                 Example 0.1.3 Explain the difference, if any, between

                                              1/n + 1(n + 2) and 1/(n + 1)(n + 2).

                 What does 1/(n + 1)(n + 2) really mean?
0.1 Remarks on Notations                                                     3

Solution: When two quantities are placed next to each other, as in xy, it is assumed that
multiplication is involved. Therefore, the first expression means, after simplification,

                          1                         1
1/n + 1(n + 2) = + 1 · (n + 2) = + n + 2.
                          n                         n

In a similar manner, the second expression means (recall that it is processed from left to right)

1/(n + 1)(n + 2) =           1                      · (n + 2) =  n+2      .

                             n+1                                 n+1

Both expressions are examples of common mistakes made by students who want to say (n+1)(n+2) 1 .
    Although many people consider 1/(n + 1)(n + 2) as an acceptable way of writing (n+1)(n+2) 1 ,

it does not make it legal! Remember: it is not what you think it means that matters. Instead,

it is what the notation should mean that determines its true meaning. We should write it as

        1
                         or 1/[(n + 1)(n + 2)].

(n + 1)(n + 2)

By the way, what is wrong if we write n+1(n+2) 1 ?

    Sometimes students misinterpret their instructors because they do not understand the basic     Expressions vs
vocabulary in mathematics. Many confuse an expression with an equation. An expression              equations
usually describes some arithmetic operations, but an equation proclaims the equality of two
quantities. In terms of notations, an expression does not contain any relational symbol, but an
equation contains an equal sign. After all, the word equation is derived from the word equate.
Hence, an important distinction is the presence of the equal sign in an equation. Consequently,
x2 + y2 is an expression, but x2 + y2 = 2 is an equation. Incidentally, do not say "the equation
x2 + y2  2 . . . ", because x2 + y2  2 is an inequality.

Hands-On Exercise 0.1.2 Explain why it is inappropriate to say
                                          "solving the equation x2 - 5".

What would you suggest to improve it?

Example 0.1.4 If we change the sentence in the last hands-on exercise to

                                         "solve the equation x2 - 5 = 0,"
                                                                                                   take square root!
what would be the solution(s)?
                                                                                         

Solution: While it is obvious that we have two solutions: x= ± 5, many students do not
fully understand the meaning of the radicalsymbol . Take 5 as an example. It means the
positive square root of 5. In other words, 5 denotes the positive real number the square of
which equals 5. Note that 5 does not mean the real number the square of which equals 5. The
difference is the keyword "positive."

    The phrase "take the square root of 5" means solving the equation x2 = 5. This requires us
to find all real numbers whose square is equal to 5. There are two solutions, one positive, the
other negative. More precisely, thesolutions are x = 5 and x = - 5, which are collectively
written as x = ± 5. The notation 5 itself, however, always means the positive solution of the
equation x2 = 5. In other words, 5 means the positive square root of 5.

                      0.2 Basic Algebra

                      A golden rule in algebra is:
                                               Simplify an expression before moving on to the next step.

                      Another piece of advice: multiplying out an expression may not help. On the contrary, it often
                      turns things into a mess. Instead, my motto is:

                                                        Use factorization to simplify an expression.

                      Example 0.2.1 Assume, after some computation, you obtain

                                                      (x2 + 1)2 · 2 - 2x · 2(x2 + 1) · 2x.

                      Use factorization to simplify it:

                                      (x2 + 1)2 · 2 - 2x · 2(x2 + 1) · 2x = 2(x2 + 1)[(x2 + 1) - 2x · 2x]
                                                                                   = 2(x2 + 1)[(x2 + 1) - 4x2]
                                                                                   = 2(x2 + 1)(1 - 3x2).

                      Leave the answer as 2(x2 + 1)(1 - 3x2), there is no need to multiply it out. Not only does it look

                      nicer and neater in its factored form, it is often more useful. For example, you may be asked to
                      find its zeros, which means finding the values of x that make it equal to zero. Since x2 + 1 can
                      never be zero, we need 1 - 3x2 = 0, which leads to

                                                                   x2 = 1 .
                                                                          3

Negative exponents        Make sure you know the laws of exponents very well. Given any positive real number a,
mean reciprocals.     and any real numbers p and q, we have

Fractional exponents                        ap · aq = ap+q,        ap = ap-q,   and (ap)q = apq.

                      In addition, we also have

                                                                   a-p = ap1 .

                      In words, the equation simply says that negative exponents can be written as reciprocals.

                         If q is a positive integer,               a q1 = q a,

                      which means the number whose qth power equals a. In general, if p and q are integers such that

                      q is positive, then                       a pq = q ap = (q a )p.

Also, remember that

                                   a0 = 1

for all positive real numbers a. If b denotes another positive real number, we also have

                     (ab)p = apbp, and     a p ap
                                           b = bp .

Hands-On Exercise 0.2.1 Simplify the following expressions as much as possible, and write
the answers so that they do not contain any negative exponents. In addition, rewrite any answer
having a fractional exponent in the form of a radical.

(a) 5x4(x2)          (b) x-3(3x2)          (c) (2x)3 3 x

    A source of frustration is careless algebraic mistakes. Most of them are habitual rather than
conceptual.

Example 0.2.2 Perhaps the most common mistake is assuming that (A + B)2 = A2 + B2.                 (A + B)2 = A2 + B2
Some teachers call it the "Freshman Theorem" or the "Freshman Dream." We cannot distribute
the power 2 over A and B. The expansion of (A + B)2 is more complicated than just the sum          We also need the
of the squares of A and B. The correct answer should be                                            middle term 2AB.

                     (A + B)2 = A2 + 2AB + B2.                                            (0.1)

We also need the middle term 2AB! An easy way to memorize the formula is to remember it in
words:

                                The square of the sum of two quantities is the
                                sum of their squares plus twice their product.

By the way, what do you think (A - B)2 should equal? Describe the result in words.

Example 0.2.3 Equation (0.1) gives us a formula for expanding the square of a sum or a
difference. Using it, we no longer need to multiply out the product. Instead, we simply apply
the formula directly to obtain the answer. Needless to say, we still have to simplify the answer.
6                                                          Chapter 0 Preliminaries

    For example, we find

                   (5a + 7bt)2 = (5a)2 + 2(5a)(7bt) + (7bt)2 = 25a2 + 70abt + 49b2t2,

and
           (3x2 - 4abc)2 = (3x2)2 - 2(3x2)(4abc) + (4abc)2 = 9x4 - 24abcx2 + 16a2b2c2.

Remember to follow the convention of writing the coefficient before the variables. With some
practice, it is not difficult to write down the answer immediately without going through the
intermediate step.

Hands-On Exercise 0.2.2 Expand and simplify the following expressions:

   (a) (x + y)2        (b) (s - t)2        (c) (1 + 4z)2
   (d) (4 - 3x)2       (e) (2a + 3b)2      (f) x + x1 2

Example 0.2.4 Equation (0.1) is often used in factorization. In the expression

                                                  16x2 + 24xy + 9y2,

there are two squared terms: 16x2 = (4x)2, and 9y2 = (3y)2, and the middle term happens to
be twice the product of their bases: 24xy = 2(4x)(3y). This fits equation (0.1) perfectly. Hence,

                                         16x2 + 24xy + 9y2 = (4x + 3y)2.

By now, we hope that you have recognized the usefulness of (0.1). Memorize it! Better still,
memorize it in words.

   (a) x2 + 4xy + 4y2  (b) 4s2 - 4st + t2  (c) 64 + 144t + 81t2
   (d) 1 - 6z2 + 9z4   (e) x2 + 2 + x2 1   (f) 9a2 - 6ab + b2

    When you learn a new formula, memorize its exact form. If the situation does not match the
pattern in a formula, do not use it! How often have you seen a quarterback force a football into
the hands of a receiver surrounded by several opponents, only to watch the ball be intercepted?
Likewise, stay away from a formula if you are not certain it applies.

Example 0.2.5  We cannot distribute the radical sign through a sum. In other words,

                          

                     A + B = A + B.

In fact,                                                                                            
                                                                                                  A+B = A+ B

                   
                     A + B cannot be simplified.

                          
What we are saying is: in general, A + B = A + B. However, for some specific values of

A and B, we may have an equality. Canyou name some examples? More specifically, can you
name a value of B for which we do have A + B = A + B?

Example 0.2.6 Another incorrect application of distributive laws can be found in the example      k(A + B)2 =
k(A + B)2 = (kA + kB)2. The correct way to expand (kA + kB)2 is                                   (kA + kB)2

                                   (kA + kB)2 = [k(A + B)]2 = k2(A + B)2.                         Don't just cross

                          =
                     B\2         B

is wrong!
    One cannot simply cross out the B's from the numerator and the denominator. To be able

to do so, B must appear as a common factor in both numerator and denominator. Again, the
proper way to cancel is through factorization. For instance:

                   AB + CB (A + C)B A + C
                       B2 = B2 = B .

                       In this case, we can cross out B because it does appear as a factor in both numerator and
                       denominator.

Know your laws of      Example 0.2.8 Be careful when you use laws of exponents, and be sure to use parentheses
exponents, and be      whenever necessary. For example:
sure to use them
correctly!                                   5x2 = (5x)2, 3x 21 = 3x, and 2x-1 = 1 .
                                                                                                                2x

                       Instead,  5x2 = 5 · x2, 3x 12 = 3x, and 2x-1 = 2 · 1 = 2 .
                                                                                                       xx

                       In contrast, (5x)2 = (5x) · (5x) = 25x2.

                       Example 0.2.9 How would you solve a quadratic equation? What is wrong with the following
                       argument?

                                             Given

                                                                 3t2 + 2t - 1 = 4,

                                             since 3t2 + 2t - 1 = (3t - 1)(t + 1), we have

                                                    (3t - 1)(t + 1) = 4.

                                             Therefore, either

                                                    3t - 1 = 4, or t + 1 = 4,

                                             solving which gives t = 53 , or t = 3, respectively.

                       Solution: The trouble is, this is the wrong way to solve an equation.

                                             To solve an equation, we first move everything to one side
                                             of the equation, so that the other side contains zero only.

                       Next, we use factorization on the side containing the nonzero expression, and then compare each
                       factor to zero.

                           Here is an illustration. To solve the equation

                                                                           3t2 + 2t - 1 = 4,

To solve an equation,  we first write it as
make sure that one
side is zero.                                                    3t2 + 2t - 5 = 0.

                       At this point, we could use the quadratic formula, but it is easier to use factorization. We find

                                                    (3t + 5)(t - 1) = 0.

                       Since the product of the two factors 3t + 5 and t - 1 equals to zero, one of them must be zero.
                       If 3t + 5 = 0, we have t = - 53 . If t - 1 = 0, we have t = 1. Therefore, the equation has two
                       solutions: either t = - 53 , or t = 1.

                           This argument also explains why the first approach is incorrect. There are many ways to
                       obtain

                                                                         (3t - 1)(t + 1) = 4.

                       Below are a few examples:

                           · 3t - 1 = 1, and t + 1 = 4,
0.3 Interval Notation                                                                                     9

· 3t - 1 = 4, and t + 1 = 1,
· 3t - 1 = 2, and t + 1 = 2,
·
   3t - 1 = -3,  and     t  +  1  =  -  4  ,
                                        3

There are infinitely many possibilities. Consequently, we do not know which one is the right
choice. In fact, most of them do not lead to a correct solution. The keyword is "and." For
example, the first pair says

                                            3t - 1 = 1 and t + 1 = 4.

This means t must satisfy the two equations 3t - 1 = 1 and t + 1 = 4 simultaneously. We need

3t - 1 = 1,  meanwhile,  we    also  need     t + 1 = 4.  But  this  would  require  t=  2  and  t=3  at  the
                                                                                         3

same time, which is clearly impossible.

However, if we start with

                                              (3t + 5)(t - 1) = 0,

we can only have either 3t + 5 = 0 or t - 1 = 0. Thus, we obtain two solutions.
    In summary: to solve an equation, make sure that one side of the equation is zero, and factor

the other side.

Summary and Review

    · Use factorization to simplify an expression.
    · Avoid algebraic mistakes. If you are not certain about a formula, do not use it! Remember:

     (A + B)2    = A2 + B2
                   
    A+B = A+ B

    k(A + B)2 = (kA + kB)2

· Before canceling a quantity from the numerator and the denominator of a fraction, make

   sure it is a common factor in both top and bottom.
· Be sure you know the laws of exponents, and how to use them correctly. In particular,

       Negative exponents mean reciprocals.
       Fractional exponents mean radicals.
· To solve an equation, be sure that one side is zero.

0.3 Interval Notation

Let a and b be two real numbers such that a  b. The interval notation [ a, b ] represents the set
of all numbers between a and b, inclusive. Graphically, we usually present it on the real number
line by means of a thick line segment. To indicate that the endpoints a and b are included, we
use a pair of solid dots. See Figure 0.1.

                            The interval [ a, b ] is a closed interval because both endpoints are included. If the endpoints
                        are omitted or excluded, we have an open interval . See Figure 0.1. By mixing an open
                        parenthesis with a square bracket, we have half-open interval .

                                                                   Figure 0.2: Infinite intervals.

                            It is important to remember that an interval consists of all real numbers between the two
                        endpoints. Therefore, it contains both integers and decimal numbers! For example, [ 5, 8 ]
                        contains more than just the four integers 5, 6, 7, and 8; it also contains numbers such as 5.3,
                        6.11, 7.40576, and many others.

                            Another remark deals with the notation. Although many people use the notation 5  x  8
                        to represent the interval [ 5, 8 ], technically, they are not quite the same. This is a semantic
                        problem. Strictly speaking, the notation 5  x  8 represents an inequality consisting of two
                        components. It means

                                                                         5  x, and x  8.

                        That is, it says that "x is larger than 5, and at the same time, x is smaller than 8." In fact, we
                        do not even know whether this claim is true unless we know the exact value of x. In contrast,
                        the interval notation [ 5, 8 ] represents the collection of all real numbers between 5 and 8. So you
                        may ask, is there any connection between them? The answer is "yes;" otherwise, people would
                        not get them mixed up. More on this in a moment.

                            Of course, one could define 5  x  8 as the notation for the interval from 5 to 8, including
                        the two endpoints 5 and 8. But such usage could be confusing. For instance, the notation may
                        refer to one particular number x between 5 and 8, but it could also mean the set of numbers
                        between 5 and 8. This is why we do not endorse this convention.

                            As we have mentioned, "5  x  8" is an inequality (in fact, two inequalities). It only
                        describes the relationship between 5, x, and 8. Technically speaking, it is a logical statement
                        proclaiming that a certain number x is larger than 5 and smaller than 8. This logical statement
                        is either true or false, and its truth value cannot be determined until we know the value of x.

                            The interval [ 5, 8 ] is a set of numbers. It is neither true nor false, because an interval has
                        no truth value. If we denote a typical number in [ 5, 8 ] as x, then we know that 5  x  8. We
                        say
0.4 The Real Number Line and the xy-Plane                              11

                             [ 5, 8 ] is the set of numbers x such that 5  x  8.                    Mathematics is
                                                                                                    more than just
Here we use the term "set", which is the mathematical way to describe a collection of objects.      computation.
In this case, the objects happen to be numbers. In general, they could be any objects.

    Take note of how we use the phrase "set of numbers x". Besides telling the readers [ 5, 8 ] is
a set of numbers, we also assign the generic name x to any number in [ 5, 8 ]. Then we continue
to say something about this general number x, namely, 5  x  8. Finally, we complete the
connection by saying "such that . . . ."

    Sound strict? Yes! Mathematics is more than doing routine calculations. Instead, it has more
to do with logical arguments. Every discipline, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, com-
puter science, economics, philosophy, and even the humanities, has its own conventions, special
terminology, and notations, put together in a way that is difficult for outsiders to understand.
Without proper training or years of experience, how many of us can read a legal document,
or a financial report of a Fortune 500 company, or a choreographic chart for a ballroom dance
competition routine? You see my point? Mathematics is no different from other areas of study.
It is just that the notations are a bit tricky, and it takes longer to learn the conventions.

Summary and Review

    · Intervals consist of all numbers between the endpoints. Whether the endpoints should be
       included depends on whether the interval is open, closed or half-open.

    · Since ± are not numbers, an interval containing ± is always open at ±.
    · The notation a  x  b does not stand for an interval, it is only an inequality.

We have already mentioned how we use the term "set" to describe a collection of objects. The
set of all real numbers is a set we use so often that we like to use a special symbol to denote
it. We use the symbol R, which is pronounced as R. When written by hand, all you need to do
is to put an extra vertical line to the left of an uppercase R. If you are using Microsoft Word,
use Insert-Symbol to insert the symbol R, which can be found under Special Symbols. If you
cannot find this symbol in your word processor, you can type R in boldface.

                mistake do they make?

                    Using the interval notation, the set of all real numbers can be written as the infinite interval

                (-, ). It follows that R = (-, ). Take note of the parentheses. Can you explain why it
                is wrong to say R = [-, ] ?

                    We represent R graphically as a line, with markings to denote real numbers, see Figure 0.3.

                    On a real number line, the values of two numbers can be compared visually according to
                their relative locations; the number on the left is smaller than the one on the right. Consequently,
                the inequality x < y can be represented graphically by placing x to the left of y on the real
                number line. See Figure 0.4.

An interval is      Graphically, it should be clear that intervals are part of the real number line. Mathematically,
a subset of R.  we say that an interval is a subset of R. Recall that we define an interval as the set of all real
                numbers between two specific numbers, and R is the set of all real numbers. By proclaiming
                that a set A is the subset of another set B, we are saying that every number you find in A can
                be found in B as well. In a way, A is the smaller set that can be placed inside B.

                    Note the usage of A and B in the last sentence. We did not say "By proclaiming that a set
                is the subset of another set, we are saying that . . . ". We could have if we chose to. However,
                if we do not assign specific names (A and B) to these two sets, imagine what we would have to
                say in the rest of the sentence. We would probably have to say "every number in the first set
                can be found in the second set." Well, it is not so bad, but it could get very complicated if we
                are not careful. It is much clearer if we use the letters A and B to distinguish the two sets.

                    A real number line is one-dimensional. We can extend it to two dimensions. The result is
                the set of all the points lying on a plane. To describe a point on it, we have to specify where it
                is located with respect to a fixed point called the origin. We use a pair of numbers to describe
                the location. The first number shows the horizontal distance from the origin, using positive
                and negative values to indicate whether it is to the right or left, respectively, of the origin.
                The second number represents the vertical distance from the origin, using positive and negative
                values to indicate whether it is above or below the origin.

                    We call these two numbers the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate, or the abscissa and
                the ordinate, respectively. The two numbers together give the Cartesian coordinate of the
                point. In writing, we enclose them within a pair of parentheses. For example, the point 3 units
                on the right of the origin and 2 units above is written as (3, 2), and the point 4 units to the left
                of and 5 units above the origin is denoted by (-4, 5). See Figure 0.5. It follows that the origin
0.5 Equations of Straight Lines                        13

is represented by (0, 0). We call this naming system the Cartesian coordinate system, and
we also call the resulting plane the xy-plane or the Cartesian plane.

                                                                             y

    The notation (2, 3) could mean either an interval on the real number line or a point on the
xy-plane. Therefore, do not just write (2, 3); add some words to describe it. For example, write
"x can be found in the interval (2, 3)," "the line L passes through the point (2, 3)," etc.

    It should be clear that (3, 2) and (2, 3) represent two different points on the xy-plane. In other
words, the order in which the x- and y-coordinates appear does make a difference. Therefore,
we call the pair of numbers an ordered pair . Hence, (3, 2) and (2, 3) are two different ordered
pairs, they represent two different locations on the xy-plane.

    We use the notation R × R (pronounced as "R cross R") to denote the xy-plane. Formally,
R × R is the set of all ordered pairs of the form (x, y), where both x and y are real numbers.
In space, we need three coordinates to describe the location of a point. Since order matters, we
use an ordered triple. The notation R × R × R denotes the resulting xyz-space. If we want
higher dimensions, we just keep adding more coordinates and inserting more crosses and Rs in
the notation. For brevity, we also write R2 instead of R × R, and R3 for R × R × R. They are
pronounced as "R two" and "R three" respectively. The extension is obvious: the n-dimensional
space is denoted by Rn, which is pronounced as "R n." and consists of all ordered n-tuples.

Summary and Review

    · R means the real number line, which consists of numbers.
    · R2 means xy-plane, which consists of ordered pairs.
    · R3 means xyz-space, which consists of ordered triples.

Most students use the slope-intercept form y = mx + b exclusively when they are asked to
find the equation of a line. There are two other forms that are equally useful. If the line passes
through two distinct points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), where x1 = x2, it is easier to use the two-point

which can be easily rearranged (via cross-multiplication) into the usual form y = mx + b.

                      The two-point form is easy to remember if you recognize that the two sides of the equation
                  compute the slope of the line in two different ways. Recall that

                                        slope =  change in y-value "rise"
                                                                      =
                                                 change in x-value "run"

                  is a concept based on similar triangles. By comparing the corresponding sides of the similar
                  triangles in Figure 0.6, it is not difficult to see how the two-point form is derived.

Point-slope form      If we already know m, the slope of the equation, and if we also know a point (x1, y1) on the
                  line, then the point-slope form tells us that the equation of the line is

                                                                         y - y1 = m.
                                                                        x - x1

                  The two-point form and the point-slope form allow us to write down the answer quickly, after
                  which we can easily rewrite the equation into the usual form y = mx+b via simple multiplication.
                  The advantage of this approach is there is no need to solve for b.

                  Example 0.5.1 Find the equation of the line that passes through the points (3, 4) and (6, 8).

                  Solution: Since we are given two points on the line, we can use the two-point form to find its

                  equation. We obtain

                                                 y-4 8-4 4
                                                        =            =,
                                                 x-3 6-3 3

                  from which we find                4                 4

                                            y = (x - 3) + 4 = x.
                                                    3                 3

                  If you use the slope-intercept form, you need to determine the value of m and solve for b, which

                  takes more time and effort. Using the two-point form, all you need is one algebraic step to

                  simplify the answer.

                  Example 0.5.2 Find the equation of the line passing through the point (1, 5) that is parallel
                  to y = 3x - 5.
0.6 Important Identities                                          15

Solution: The slope of the line is 3. Hence, we know the slope of the line and a point on it.

The point-slope form yields

                             y-5
                                     =3

                             x-1

immediately. Therefore, the answer is y = 3(x - 1) + 5 = 3x + 2.

0.6 Important Identities

Below is a list of important identities that every student should know. Pay special attention to
Identities 1, 5 and 8, it will not take you long to recognize their importance.

   1. (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
       (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
       These two identities are often combined into one: (a ± b)2 = a2 ± 2ab + b2

   2. a2 - b2 = (a - b)(a + b),
   3. a3 - b3 = (a - b)(a2 + ab + b2)
   4. a3 + b3 = (a + b)(a2 - ab + b2)

                      10. sin(-) = - sin , cos(-) = cos , tan(-) = - tan 

                      11. sin( 2 - ) = cos ,             tan( 2 - ) = cot , sec( 2 - ) = csc

                      Although you need not use the trigonometric identities in this course, they are considered stan-
                      dard knowledge that every mathematics student should possess. I have seen students struggle
                      with problems that could be easily solved if they knew these trigonometric identities. If you are
                      really serious about learning mathematics, memorize them!

                      Example 0.6.1 Applying Identity 5 to x5 - 32y5, we obtain the factorization

                              x5 - 32y5 = x5 - (2y)5
                                             = (x - 2y) [ x4 + x3(2y) + x2(2y)2 + x(2y)3 + (2y)4 ]
                                             = (x - 2y)(x4 + 2x3y + 4x2y2 + 8xy3 + 16y4).

                      Notice that

                        (i) in order to use the identity, both quantities must be raised to the same power, hence we
                             need to write 32y5 as (2y)5, and

                        (ii) after applying the identity, we have to simplify the results.

                      Finally, be sure to write every term in the standard convention, with the coefficient before a
                      power of x, followed by a power of y.

                      Example 0.6.2 Factor x6 - y6 as much as possible.

                      Solution: Sure enough, we can apply Identity 5 to obtain the factorization
                                                x6 - y6 = (x - y)(x5 + x4y + x3y2 + x2y3 + xy4 + y5).

                      However, it is not clear whether this is the best we could do. In other words, it is not clear
                      whether we can factor the second factor on the right-side any further. The lesson learned is: do
                      not stop after you obtain an answer, always look for alternate approaches, because they could
                      lead to better solutions.

                          Indeed, we can factor x6 - y6 in two other ways. We can write

                                                             x6 = (x2)3, and y6 = (y2)3.

                      But we can also write

                                                         x6 = (x3)2, and y6 = (y3)2.
0.6 Important Identities                                                           17

We can apply Identity 5 with either n = 3 or n = 2. From x6 = (x2)3 and y6 = (y2)3, we have           Here is a better
                                                                                                      solution.
                                 x6 - y6 = (x2)3 - (y2)3
                                             = (x2 - y2) (x2)2 + x2y2 + (y2)2
                                             = (x - y)(x + y)(x4 + x2y2 + y4).

From x6 = (x3)2 and y6 = (y3)2, we obtain

                        x6 - y6 = (x3)2 - (y3)2
                                     = (x3 - y3)(x3 + y3)
                                     = (x - y)(x2 + xy + y2)(x + y)(x2 - xy + y2).

The last result is of course better than the first two. After comparing the last two factorizations,
we learn that it is always better to start with rewriting the given polynomial in the form an - bn
with the smallest possible value in n.

    The last two factorizations also produce a byproduct. It is obvious that they must be equal.
Since they share the common factors (x - y)(x + y), whatever remain must be equal as well. We
have derived the identity

                               x4 + x2y2 + y4 = (x2 + xy + y2)(x2 - xy + y2).

Here is a challenge for you. Can you find a way to factor x4 + x2y2 + y4 directly into the product
(x2 +xy +y2)(x2 -xy +y2)? Let us give you a hint. What is the difference between x4 +x2y2 +y4
and (x2 + y2)2?

Hands-On Exercise 0.6.1 Factor a12 - b12 as much as possible.

Example 0.6.3 Derive a formula for the sum

                                               1 + r + r2 + · · · + rn-1,
where n  1 denotes the number of terms in the summation.

Solution: Using Identity 5, by setting a = 1 and b = r, we find                    (0.2)
                                   1 - rn = (1 - r)(1 + r + r2 + · · · + rn-1).

Therefore,                1 + r + r2 + · · · + rn-1 = 1 - rn .

In particular, if |r| < 1, the quantity rn becomes zero as n approaches infinity.  This gives us

Identity 8.
18                                                          Chapter 0 Preliminaries

Hands-On Exercise 0.6.2  Use (0.2) to evaluate
                                  1 + 2 + 22 + · · · + 210

and
                                               34 + 35 + 36 + · · · + 312.

Hint: For the second problem, try to factor out a common factor first.

    Identity 8 tells us how to find the sum of an infinite geometric series

                                                1 + r + r2 + r3 + · · · .

It adds up to 1-r 1 . There are three restrictions (besides the obvious requirement that it is an
infinite series):

  (i) The series must be geometric, this means the ratio of any two consecutive terms must be
       the same. In the identity, this common ratio is r.

  (ii) The geometric series has to start with 1.
 (iii) We must have |r| < 1 in order to use the identity.

A summation not meeting these three conditions needs to be modified before we can apply the
identity.

Example 0.6.4 The recurring (or repeating) decimal 0.17 means 0.17171717 . . . . Although
the pattern 17 repeats indefinitely, it is actually a rational number1. There are several ways
to convert a recurring decimal number into a rational number. One of them is to write it as a
geometric series:

    0.17171717 . . . = 0.17 + 0.0017 + 0.000017 + 0.00000017 + · · ·
                         = 0.17 + 0.17 (0.01) + 0.17 (0.01)2 + 0.17 (0.01)3 + · · ·

It is geometric because the ratio of any two consecutive terms is always 0.01 (hence, r = 0.01).
However, its first term is not 1. But we can rescue the situation by means of factorization:

               0.17171717 . . . = 0.17 + 0.17 (0.01) + 0.17 (0.01)2 + 0.17 (0.01)3 + · · ·
                                     = 0.17 1 + 0.01 + 0.012 + 0.013 + · · · .

Now we can apply Identity 8 to obtain

    0.17171717 . . . = 0.17 ·          1  =                 0.17 17
                                                            =.
                                       1 - 0.01 0.99 99

Therefore, the recurring decimal 0.17 is indeed a rational number.

    1A rational number is a number that can beexpressed as the ratio of two integers. A number which is not
rational is said to be irrational . For example, 2 is irrational. Note, however, a fraction is not necessary a
rational number. For instance, 1 is a fraction, but it is irrational.

answer as much as possible; that is, reduce the fraction to its lowest terms.

Example 0.6.5 Write 0.317 as a rational number.

Solution: We find

           0.317 = 0.3 + 0.017 + 0.00017 + 0.0000017 + 0.000000017 + · · ·

                   = 0.3 + 0.017 1 + 0.01 + 0.0001 + 0.000001 + · · ·

                   = 0.3 + 0.017 1 + 0.01 + 0.012 + 0.013 + · · ·

                                    1 - 0.01

It remains to simplify the answer:

                   0.317 = 0.3 +    0.017 3 17 314 157
                                             =+ = = .
                                    0.99 10 990 990 495

This shows that 0.317 is a rational number.

Hands-On Exercise 0.6.4 Express the following recurring decimal numbers as rational num-
bers. Remember to simplify (reduce to lowest terms) the answers as much as possible.

Example 0.6.6 A power series is an infinite series that involves the powers of a variable. Its
interval of convergence is the range of values the variable can assume so that the resulting
infinite series converges. For example,

                                              1 + 2x + 4x2 + 8x3 + · · ·

is a power series that takes the form of a geometric series with common ratio 2x. If |2x| < 1,

the series converges to 1-2x 1 . We say that the closed form of the power series is 1-2x 1 . Notice
that |2x| < 1 is equivalent to |x| < 12 , which happens when - 12 < x < 12 . It follows that the
interval of convergence is - 12 , 12 .

their intervals of convergence.

0.7 Sigma Notation

In the formula  1 + r + r2 + r3 + · · · = 1 ,
                                               1-r
                                                    if |r| < 1,

the ellipsis . . . is pronounced as "and so on" or simply "dot dot dot." It means "continues in

the same manner." In this case, it means adding up the remaining similar terms.

    Since the first few terms are powers of r, similar terms here means the successive powers of
r. Consequently, the next few terms are r4, r5, r6, and so forth. Since the summation does not

indicate when to stop, the pattern will be repeated indefinitely. Thus, the formula claims that

the sum of all these powers of r, starting with r0 = 1, r1 = r, r2, and so on, should add up to
1-r 1 , provided |r| < 1.

    Ellipses can be used to describe a summation that involves a finite number of terms. For

instance,

                                 1+2+3+···+n
0.7 Sigma Notation                                                    21

means the sum of 1, 2, 3, and so on, all the way up to and including n. However, it may not be
as simple as it seems. What does

                                                  3+4+5+···+n

mean? It tells us to add 3, 4, 5, and so on, all the way up to n, right? Well, almost! What if,
say, n = 4? According to the appearance of the expression, we want to add up the numbers 3,
4, 5, and so on, all the way up to 4. However, the number 4 appears before 5. How can we add
3, 4, and 5, but stop the calculation at 4?

    The truth is, when we say
                                                  3 + 4 + 5 + · · · + n,

we do not demand that we must include the first three term, 3, 4 and 5, in the sum. We put
three terms at the beginning to establish a pattern so that we know what ". . ." means. The
pattern exhibited in the first three terms suggests that the next few terms, if there are any,
should be 6, 7, 8, and so on. These are consecutive integers. Therefore, what the expression
really means is the summation consists of consecutive integers, starting from 3, all the way up
to and including n. Hence, when n = 4, the sum reduces to 3 + 4, which equals 7.

Example 0.7.1 Note that this also means that n has to be at least 3 for the summation to             The sum is "empty"
make any sense. Consequently, the sum is meaningless if n  2. For computational purposes,            if n  2.
we adopt the convention that an empty sum equals zero.

Example 0.7.2 Evaluate

                        2 · 3 + 3 · 4 + 4 · 5 + · · · + n(n + 1)

when n = 3.

Solution: We start from 2 · 3, and stop at n(n + 1). In this case, we should stop at 3 · 4. Hence,
there are only two terms in the summation: 2 · 3 + 3 · 4. The answer is 18.

Example 0.7.3 Evaluate

                        7 + 4 · 5 + 5 · 6 + 6 · 7 + · · · + n(n + 1)

when n = 5.

Solution: This is a tricky problem. The pattern does not emerge until we hit 4 · 5, 5 · 6, 6 · 7,
and so on. In other words, 7 is an unusual term that does not conform to the pattern exhibited
in ". . .". This also means that no matter what n is, 7 is always part of the sum. Incidentally, it
should be clear that n is at least 4 because the repeating pattern starts from 4 · 5, and stops at
n(n + 1). In particular, when n = 5, the sum reduces to 7 + 4 · 5 + 5 · 6 = 57.

    What if n = 2? In this case, the sum

                                        4 · 5 + 5 · 6 + 6 · 7 + · · · + n(n + 1)

is empty. The answer is 7.

    These examples demonstrate the inadequacy of the ". . ." notation. A better alternative is
sigma notation, which is also called summation notation. We write

                                                                                       n

                                                                i

                                                                                      i=1

for the summation 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n. The uppercase Greek letter resembles the uppercase
English letter S, which reminds us of summation. The letter i is the index of summation.
By putting i = 1 under and n above, we declare that the sum starts with i = 1, and ranges
22                                                                          Chapter 0 Preliminaries

through i = 2, i = 3, and so on, until i = n. The quantity that follows                describes the pattern
of the terms that we are adding in the summation.

Example 0.7.4 Here are a few examples:

                                                                         n

                                    3+4+5+···+n =                           i,

                                                                      i=3
                                                                       n

                          2 · 3 + 3 · 4 + 4 · 5 + · · · + n(n + 1) =        i(i + 1),

                                                                      i=2
                                                                               n

                   7 + 4 · 5 + 5 · 6 + 6 · 7 + · · · + n(n + 1) = 7 + i(i + 1),

                                    1 + t + t2 + t3 + · · · =                  i=4
                                                                         

                                                                            ti,

                                                                      i=0

                                                                                       

                               a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + · · · =                 ari = a ri.

                                                                      i=0              i=0

Pay attention to how we leave 7 outside the sigma notation in the third example.

Example 0.7.5 Evaluate

                               3                                      3

                                    (5 + i), and 5 + i.

                               i=1                                    i=1

Solution: While

                        3

                           (5 + i) = (5 + 1) + (5 + 2) + (5 + 3) = 6 + 7 + 8 = 21,

                       i=1

we find                                 3
Therefore,
                               5 + i = 5 + (1 + 2 + 3) = 11.

                                      i=1

                                    3    3

                                         (5 + i) = 5 + i.

                                    i=1  i=1

Here is another way to look at the difference between the two summations. In                 i=1 3 (5 + i), the
quantity 5 is added three times, but the quantity 5 is added only once in 5 +               i=1 3 i.

Example 0.7.6 Evaluate the summations i=2 5 i2 and i=5 5 i2.

Solution: We find

                           5

                              i2 = 22 + 32 + 42 + 52 = 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 54,

                          i=2

and  5      i2  =  52  =  25.
     i=5

Example 0.7.7 For k  1, evaluate i=1 k+1 i2 - i=1 k i2.
0.7 Sigma Notation                                                              23

Solution: The two summations look almost identical, except for when i stops. It is clear that
   i=1 k+1 i2 has one more term than i=1 k i2, namely, the last term, where i = k + 1. Therefore,

their difference is the last term. We determine that

                                         k+1  k

                                              i2 - i2 = (k + 1)2.

                                         i=1  i=1

The order of the subtraction is important: what would be the answer if we change the problem
to i=1 k i2 - i=1 k+1 i2?

Hands-On Exercise 0.7.1 For k  2, evaluate i=1 k-1 i2 - i=1 k i2.

Hands-On Exercise 0.7.2 For k  4, evaluate i=3 i(i+1) k+1 1 - i=4 i(i+1) k 1 .

Example 0.7.8        What must be added to         i=1 k i(i + 1) so as to change the summation to
  i=1 k+1 i(i + 1)?

Solution: We need to add the next term (where i = k + 1) to the summation       i=1 k i(i + 1) to
change it to i=1 k+1 i(i + 1). Thus the answer is (k + 1)(k + 2).

Hands-On Exercise 0.7.3                  What term should be added to  i=4 k (i2 + 2i) to change it to
  i=4 k+1(i2 + 2i)?

An Introduction

1.1 An Overview

What is discrete mathematics? Roughly speaking, it is the study of discrete objects. Here,
discrete means "containing distinct or unconnected elements." Examples include:

    · Determining whether a mathematical argument is logically correct.
    · Studying the relationship between finite sets.
    · Counting the number of ways to arrange objects in a certain pattern.
    · Analyzing processes that involve a finite number of steps.
Here are a few reasons why we study discrete mathematics:
    · To develop our ability to understand and create mathematical arguments.
    · To provide the mathematical foundation for advanced mathematics and computer science

       courses.

In this text, we will cover these five topics:

   1. Logic and Proof Techniques. Logic allows us to determine if a certain argument is
       valid. We will also learn several basic proof techniques.

   2. Sets. We study the fundamental properties of sets, and we will use the proof techniques
       we learned to prove important results in set theory.

   3. Basic Number Theory . Number theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics; it
       studies properties of integers. Again, we will use the proof techniques we learned to prove
       some basic facts in number theory.

   4. Relations and Functions. Relations and functions describe the relationship between
       the elements from two sets. They play a key role in mathematics.

   5. Combinatorics. Combinatorics studies the arrangement of objects. For instance, one
       may ask, in how many ways can we form a five-letter word. It is used in many disciplines
       beyond mathematics.

All of these topics are crucial in the development of your mathematical maturity. The importance
of some of these concepts may not be apparent at the beginning. As time goes on, you will slowly
understand why we cover such topics. In fact, you may not fully appreciate the subjects until
you start taking advanced courses in mathematics.

    This is a very challenging course partly because of its intensity. We have to cover many
topics that appear totally unrelated at first. This is also the first time many students have to
study mathematics in depth. You will be asked to write up your mathematical argument clearly,
precisely, and rigorously, which is a new experience for most of you.
26  Chapter 1 An Introduction

    Learning how to think mathematically is far more important than knowing how to do all
the computations. Consequently, the principal objective of this course is to help you develop
the analytic skills you need to learn mathematics. To achieve this goal, we will show you the
motivation behind the ideas, explain the results, and dissect why some solution methods work
while others do not.

1.2 Suggestions to Students

All mathematics courses are difficult. It takes hard work and patience to learn mathematics.
Rote memorization does not work. Here are some suggestions that you may find helpful:

   1. Do not skip classes.

   2. Read the text, including the examples, before the lecture; review what you have learned
       after each lecture.

   3. Do the exercises.

        (a) First, study the examples in the book.
        (b) Make an effort to understand how and why a solution works, and remember how

              certain types of problems should be solved.
         (c) When you do a problem, ask yourself if you have seen something similar before; if

              you have, follow the steps in its solution.
        (d) After solving a problem, look for alternate solutions, analyze and compare their

              differences.

   4. Get help from the instructor, your friends, and whatever facility your college provides.

   5. Develop good study habits.

        (a) Keep working every day: study the book, your own lecture notes, and, most important
              of all, do the exercises at the end of each section.

        (b) Form a study group of two to three students, and meet on a regular basis to study
              together.

         (c) Check the solutions for any nonsense or discrepancies.
        (d) Learn how to solve the problems systematically.

   6. Perseverance. Do not give up easily.

   7. Be willing to help your classmates. Trying to explain something to others is the best way
       to learn anything new.

    Attitude is the real difference between success and failure. Nothing comes easy. To succeed,
you have to work hard. But you also need to learn how to learn mathematics the right way.

    · Do not rely on memorizing formulas or procedures by rote. Instead, try to understand the
       concepts and ideas behind them. It is important to learn when and how to use them.

    · Of course, it does not mean that you need not memorize anything at all. On the contrary,
       many basic results and definitions need to be memorized. You may find it helpful to use
       a highlighter to mark the definitions and keywords that you have trouble recalling, and I
       urge you to review them frequently.

    · Do not compartmentalize the material; all sections are connected in one way or another.
       Consequently, as you move along from chapter to chapter and from section to section, try
       to observe the connections between the concepts you have learned. Without saying, it is
       understood that you need to remember what you had learned earlier.
1.3 How to Read and Write Mathematics  27

· Write down all intermediate and partial results clearly. For instance, if the value of x is 7,
   do not just jot down the number 7; instead, write x = 7. Otherwise, you may forget what
   7 is after just a few minutes. In brief, present your results in such a way that they can be
   read and understood by everyone in the class.

· While we are on the subject, let us comment briefly how to write up a solution. Take your
   homework assignments seriously. Keep in mind: to study for a test, you may want to
   review your homework, so you need to be able to read your own work. Write everything
   clearly and neatly. The process of writing out everything correctly helps you think about
   what you write. Very often, incoherent and incomprehensible writing is an indication of
   lack of understanding of the subject matter.

· When doing your homework assignments, start with a draft, then look over it carefully,
   check the spelling and grammar, and revise the solution. Make sure you write in complete
   sentences and use correct notations. If necessary, you may have to polish it further. Before
   turning in the final version, be sure to check again for any mistakes that you may have
   overlooked.

How should a student use this workbook?

1. Read the workbook before class, and study the workbook again after each class.
2. Read and study the examples in the workbook.
3. Do the hands-on exercises.
4. Do the section exercises.

1.3 How to Read and Write Mathematics

Reading mathematics is difficult for beginners. It takes patience and practice to learn how to
read mathematics. You may need to read a sentence or a paragraph several times before you
understand it completely. There are writing styles and notational conventions that you acquire
only by reading and paying attention to how mathematics is written. As we proceed with the
course, we will discuss the details. As a starter, let us offer several suggestions.

    · Make sure you know the definition of mathematical terms, the meaning and proper usage of
       mathematical symbols and notations. Although this may sound obvious, many beginners
       have difficulty understanding a mathematical argument because they fail to recall the
       exact meaning of certain mathematical concepts.

    · Often, the reason behind a claim lies in the sentence before it. Sometimes it could be
       found in the preceding paragraph, and it is not unusual that you may need to check
       several sentences or paragraphs before it. You need to take an active role in reading
       mathematics, and you need to remember what you have read.

    · Mathematicians prefer short and elegant proofs. To do this, they suppress the details of
       what they consider as "obvious" reasons. But what is obvious to one reader may not be
       that obvious to another. At any rate, for practical reasons, it is impossible to include every
       minute step in a mathematical argument. Consequently, keep your pencil and paper next
       to you, and be ready to check the calculation and fill in the missing details.

    · It may help to try out some examples just to see how an argument works.

    · After you finish reading a proof, go over it one more time, and try to summarize its key
       steps (in other words, try to draw an outline of the proof) in your own words.

    Writing mathematics is even harder! It takes much longer to learn how to write mathematics.
Of course, the most important thing about a mathematical argument is its correctness. When
we say "good" mathematical writing, we are talking about precision, clarity, and sound logic.
28                                                           Chapter 1 An Introduction

    · Be precise! For example, do not just say "it" when it is unclear which quantity you are
       referring to. This is particularly true in a lengthy argument. In this regard, it helps to
       identify and hence distinguish different quantities by their names such as x, y, z, etc.

    · Use mathematical terms correctly! A common mistake is confusing an expression with an
       equation. An equation has an equal sign, as in

                                                 x + y = 5,

    but an expression does not, as in

                                                 x + y.

    · Likewise, the following is an inequality:

                                                 x + y  5.

       Do not call it an equation!

    · Do not abuse the word "solve." For instance, many students would say "solve 52 + 73."
       A more appropriate saying should be "compute the value of 52 + 73," or simply "evaluate
       52 + 73."

In the beginning, it helps to follow what others do. This again means you need to read a lot of
mathematical writing, and pick up styles that you are comfortable with. We often follow some
conventions (unwritten rules, if you prefer) that everyone follows.

Example 1.3.1 Consider this argument for showing that (x - y)(x + y) = x2 - y2:

                              We want to show that
                                              (x - y)(x + y) = x2 - y2.

                              After expanding the product on the left-hand side,
                              we find

                                          = x2 + xy - yx - y2 = x2 - y2,

                              which is what we want to prove.

The logic and mathematics in the argument are correct, but not the notation. In formal writing,
each equation should be a stand-alone equation. The last equation is incomplete, because it does
not have anything on the left-hand side of the equal sign. Here is a proper way to write the
argument:

                              We want to show that
                                              (x - y)(x + y) = x2 - y2.

                              After expanding the product on the left-hand side,
                              we find

                                (x - y)(x + y) = x2 + xy - yx - y2 = x2 - y2,

                              which is what we want to prove.

The fix is simple: just repeat the left-hand side.
1.3 How to Read and Write Mathematics                                               29

Example 1.3.2 Short and simple mathematical expressions or equations such as a2 + b2 = c2
can be written within a paragraph. Longer ones and expressions or equations that are important
should be displayed separately, and centered, on their own lines, as in

                                         x3 - y3 = (x - y)(x2 + xy + y2).

If we intend to refer to the equation later, assign a number to it, and enclose the number within

parentheses:

              x2 - y2 = (x - y)(x + y).                                             (1.1)

Now, for example, we can say, because of (1.1), we find

              135 = 144 - 9 = 122 - 32 = (12 - 3)(12 + 3) = 9 · 15.

For a longer equation such as
                    (x + y)2 = (x + y)(x + y) = x2 + xy + xy + y2 = x2 + 2xy + y2,

it may look better and easier to follow if we break it up into several lines, and line them up
along the equal signs:

                                         (x + y)2 = (x + y)(x + y)
                                                       = x2 + xy + xy + y2
                                                       = x2 + 2xy + y2.

Although we display the equation in three lines, they together form one equation. The equal
signs at the beginning of the second and third lines indicate that they are the continuation of
the previous line. Since this is actually one long equation, we only need to say (x + y)2 once,
namely, at the beginning.

    When part of the right-hand side extends beyond the margin, you may want to balance the
look of the entire equation by repositioning the left-hand side:

                  (x2 + 2xy + y2)(x2 + 2xy + y2)
                     = x4 + 2x3y + x2y2 + 2x3y + 4x2y2 + 2xy3 + x2y2 + 2xy3 + y4
                     = x4 + 4x3y + 6x2y2 + 4xy3 + y4.

In the multi-line display format, always write the equal signs at the beginning of the lines. Do
not forget to align the equal signs.

    When part of the right-hand side is too long to display as a single piece, we may split it into
multiple pieces:

               (x + y)5 = (x + y)2(x + y)3
                            = (x2 + 2xy + y2)(x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3)
                            = x5 + 3x4y + 3x3y2 + x2y3 + 2x4y + 6x3y2 + 6x2y3 + 2xy4
                                      + x3y2 + 3x2y3 + 3xy4 + y5
                            = x5 + 5x4y + 10x3y2 + 10x2y3 + 5xy4 + y5.

It is a common practice to use indentation to indicate the continuation of part of a line into the
next.

    There will be more discussion as we continue. Let us not forget: the best way to learn is
to watch and observe how others do it. Reading is a must! Reading and analyzing technical
papers will surely improve your mathematical knowledge as well as your writing.

                      1.4 Proving Identities

                      There are many methods that one can use to prove an identity. The simplest is to use algebraic
                      manipulation, as we have demonstrated in the previous examples. In an algebraic proof, there
                      are three acceptable approaches:

                          · From left to right: expand or simplify the left-hand side until you obtain the right-hand
                             side.

                          · From right to left: expand or simplify the right-hand side until you obtain the left-hand
                             side.

                          · Meet in the middle: expand or simplify the left-hand side and the right-hand side separately
                             until you obtain the same result from both sides.

                      Example 1.4.1 To prove that

                                                               x3 - y3 = (x - y)(x2 + xy + y2),

                      we start from the right-hand side, because it is more complicated than the left-hand side. The
                      proof proceeds as follows:

                                            (x - y)(x2 + xy + y2) = x3 - x2y + x2y - xy2 + xy2 - y3
                                                                            = x3 - y3.

                      Remember: start from one side and work on it until you obtain the other side.

                      Example 1.4.2 The following "proof" of

                                        x4 + x2y2 + y4 = (x2 + xy + y2)(x2 - xy + y2)

                      is incorrect:

A wrong proof.            x4 + x2y2 + y4 = (x2 + xy + y2)(x2 - xy + y2)
Another wrong proof.                            = x4 - x3y + x2y2 + x3y - x2y2 + xy3 + x2y2 - xy3 + y4
                                                = x4 + x2y2 + y4.

                      Here is the reason. When we place

                                                      x4 + x2y2 + y4 = (x2 + xy + y2)(x2 - xy + y2)

                      at the start of the proof, by convention, we are proclaiming that x4 + x2y2 + y4 is indeed equal
                      to (x2 + xy + y2)(x2 - xy + y2). However, this is what we are asked to prove. Before we have
                      actually proved that it is true, we do not know yet, whether they are equal. Therefore, it is
                      wrong to start the proof with it.

                      Example 1.4.3 For the same reason, the following "proof" of the identity

                                        x3 - y3 = (x - y)(x2 + xy + y2)

                      is unacceptable:

                                        x3 - y3 = (x - y)(x2 + xy + y2)
                                        x3 - y3 = x3 - x2y + x2y - xy2 + xy2 - y3
                                        x3 - y3 = x3 - y3
1.4 Proving Identities                                                                                                 31

By putting x3 - y3 on the left-hand side of every line, this becomes (by convention) a collection
of three equations. In a nutshell, the argument starts with an equation and we simplify until
we obtain something we know is true. If this format is valid, we can "prove" that 21 = 6, as
follows:

                                                  21 = 6
                                                   6 = 21

                                                  27 = 27

By writing 21 = 6 at the beginning of the proof, what we really say is "Assume 21 = 6 is true."
But this is what we intend to prove. Thus, in effect, we are putting the cart in front of the
horse, which is logically incorrect. There is another explanation why this proof is incorrect. We
shall discuss it in Section 2.3.

    In brief: we cannot start with the given identity and simplify both sides until we obtain an
equality (or an equation of the form 0 = 0).

Example 1.4.4  Show        that  1  k(k + 1)(2k + 1) + (k + 1)2               =  1  (k  +  1)(k  +    2)(2k    +  3).
                                 6                                               6

Solution 1: We can use the "meet in the middle" approach. Recall that we cannot simplify
both sides simultaneously. Instead, we should expand the two sides separately, and then compare
the results. We also suggest adding more writing (in words) to help with the explanation.

After expansion, the left-hand side becomes

1  k(k         +    1)(2k     +  1)  +  (k  +  1)2      =     1  (2k3   +  3k2   +  k)  +   (k2  +    2k  +  1)
6                                                             6

                                                        = 13 k3 + 32 k2 + 136 k + 1.

The right-hand side expands into

                    1  (k  +  1)(k   +  2)(2k  +    3)     =     1  (2k3   +  9k2   +   13k  +   6)
                    6                                            6

                                                           = 13 k3 + 32 k2 + 136 k + 1.

Since both sides yield the same result, they must be equal.

Although the proof is correct, it requires two sets of computation. It is much easier to use either
the left-to-right or the right-to-left approach.

Solution 2: A better alternative is to start from the left-hand side and simplify it until we
obtain the right-hand side. Our secret weapon is factorization:

   1           k(k  +  1)(2k  +     1)  +  (k  +  1)2   =        1  (k  +  1)[k(2k  +   1)   +  6(k   +   1)]
   6                                                             6

                                                        =        1  (k  +  1)(2k2   +   7k  +   6)
                                                                 6

                                                        =        1  (k  +  1)(k  +  2)(2k    +   3).
                                                                 6

This approach is usually better and safer, because no messy computation is involved.

Hands-On Exercise 1.4.1 Show that

               k(k + 1)(k + 2)          + (k + 1)(k + 2) =              (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3)         .

                           3                                                        3

Be sure to use one of the three methods we discussed above.

Summary and Review

    · There are only three ways to prove an identity: left to right, right to left, or meet in the
       middle.

    · Never prove an identity by simplifying both sides simultaneously.

Logic

2.1 Propositions

The rules of logic allow us to distinguish between valid and invalid arguments. Besides mathe-
matics, logic has numerous applications in computer science, including the design of computer
circuits and the construction of computer programs. To analyze whether a certain argument is
valid, we first extract its syntax.
Example 2.1.1 These two arguments:

    · If x + 1 = 5, then x = 4. Therefore, if x = 4, then x + 1 = 5.
    · If I watch Monday night football, then I will miss the following Tuesday 8 a.m. class.

       Therefore, if I do not miss my Tuesday 8 a.m. class, then I did not watch football the
       previous Monday night.
use the same format:
       If p then q. Therefore, if q is false then p is false.
If we can establish the validity of this type of argument, then we have proved at once that both
arguments are legitimate. In fact, we have also proved that any argument using the same format
is also credible.
Hands-On Exercise 2.1.1 Can you give another argument that uses the same format in the
last example?

    In mathematics, we are interested in statements that can be proved or disproved. We define
a proposition (sometimes called a statement, or an assertion) to be a sentence that is either
true or false, but not both.
Example 2.1.2 The following sentences:

    · Barack Obama is the president of the United States.
    · 2 + 3 = 6.
are propositions, because each of them is either true or false (but not both).
34               Chapter 2 Logic

Example 2.1.3 These two sentences:
    · Ouch!
    · What time is it?

are not propositions because they do not proclaim anything; they are exclamation and question,
respectively.

Example 2.1.4 Explain why the following sentences are not propositions:

  (a) x + 1 = 2.

  (b) x - y = y - x.
  (c) A2 = 0 implies A = 0.

Solution: (a) This equation is not a statement because we cannot tell whether it is true or false
unless we know the value of x. It is true when x = 1; it is false for other x-values. Since the
sentence is sometimes true and sometimes false, it cannot be a statement.
(b) For the same reason, since x - y = y - x is sometimes true and sometimes false, it cannot
be a statement.
(c) This looks like a statement because it appears to be true all the time. Yet, this is not a
statement, because we never say what A represents. The claim is true if A is a real number, but
it is not always true if A is a matrix1. Thus, it is not a proposition.

Hands-On Exercise 2.1.2 Explain why these sentences are not propositions:

  (a) He is the quarterback of our football team.

(b) x + y = 17.

(c) AB = BA.

Example 2.1.5 Although the sentence "x + 1 = 2" is not a statement, we can change it into
a statement by adding some condition on x. For instance, the following is a true statement:

                                 For some real number x, we have x + 1 = 2.

and the statement

                                  For all real numbers x, we have x + 1 = 2.

is false. The parts of these two statements that say "for some real number x" and "for all real
numbers x" are called quantifiers. We shall study them in Section 2.6.

    1Some students may not be familiar with matrices. A matrix is rectangular array of numbers. Matrices are
important tools in mathematics. The product of two matrices of appropriate sizes is defined in a rather unusual
way. It is the peculiar way that two matrices are multiplied that makes matrices so useful in mathematics. The
square of a matrix is of course the product of the matrix with itself. It is well-defined only when the matrix is a
square matrix. As it turns out, the order of multiplication of two matrices is important. In other words, given
any two matrices A and B, it is not always true that AB = BA.
2.1 Propositions  35

Example 2.1.6 Saying that

        "A statement is not a proposition if we cannot decide whether it is true or false."

is different from saying that

                            "A statement is not a proposition if we do not know
                                   how to verify whether it is true or false."

The more important issue is whether the truth value of the statement can be determined in
theory. Consider the sentence

            Every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes.

Nobody has ever proved or disproved this claim, so we do not know whether it is true or false,
even though computational data suggest it is true. Nevertheless, it is a proposition because it
is either true or false but not both. It is impossible for this sentence to be true sometimes, and
false at other times. With the advancement of mathematics, someone may be able to either
prove or disprove it in the future. The example above is the famous Goldbach Conjecture,
which dates back to 1742.

    We usually use the lowercase letters p, q and r to represent propositions. This can be
compared to using variables x, y and z to denote real numbers. Since the truth values of p,
q, and r vary, they are called propositional variables. A proposition has only two possible
values: it is either true or false. We often abbreviate these values as T and F, respectively.

    Given a proposition p, we form another proposition by changing its truth value. The result
is called the negation of p, and is denoted ¬p or  p, both of which are pronounced as "not
p." The similarity between the notations ¬p and -x is obvious.

    We can also write the negation of p as p, which is pronounced as "p bar." The truth value
of p is opposite of that of p. Hence, if p is true, then p would be false; and if p is false, then p
would be true. We summarize these results in a truth table:

                                                           pp
                                                          TF
                                                           FT

Example 2.1.7 Find the negation of the following statements:

  (a) George W. Bush is the president of the United States.
  (b) It is not true that New York is the largest state in the United States.
  (c) x is a real number such that x = 4.
  (d) x is a real number such that x < 4.

If necessary, you may rephrase the negated statements, and change a mathematical notation to
a more appropriate one.

Solution: (a) George W. Bush is not the president of the United States.

(b) It is true that New York is the largest state in the United States.

(c) The phrase "x is a real number" describes what kinds of numbers we are considering. The
main part of the proposition is the proclamation that x = 4. Hence, we only need to negate
"x = 4". The answer is:

                                       x is a real number such that x = 4.

(d) x is a real number such that x  4.

  (a) x is an integer greater than 7.

                      (b) We can factor 144 into a product of prime numbers.
                      (c) The number 64 is a perfect square.

                        Since we will be studying numbers throughout this course, it is convenient to introduce some
                    notations to facilitate our discussion. Let

                                         N = the set of natural numbers (positive integers),
                                         Z = the set of integers,
                                         R = the set of real numbers, and
                                         Q = the set of rational numbers.

                    Recall that a rational number is a number that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers.

                    Hence,  a  rational  number  can  be  written  as  m  for  some  integers  m  and  n,  where  n  =  0.  If  you
                                                                       n

                    use a word processor, and cannot find, for example, the symbol N, you may use bold face N as

                    a replacement.

                    We usually use uppercase letters such as A, B, C, S and T to represent sets, and denote

                    their elements by the corresponding lowercase letters a, b, c, s, and t, respectively. To indicate

                    that b is an element of the set B, we adopt the notation

                                         b  B [pronounced as "b belongs to B"].

                    Occasionally, we also use the notation

                                                 B b [pronounced as "B contains b"].

The meaning of kS.  Consequently, saying x  R is another way of saying x is a real number.
                        Denote the set of positive real numbers, the set of negative real numbers, and the set of

                    nonzero real numbers, by inserting the appropriate sign in the superscript:

                                                    R+ = the set of all positive real numbers,
                                                    R- = the set of all negative real numbers,
                                                     R = the set of all nonzero real numbers.

                    The same convention applies to Z and Q. Notice that Z+ is same as N.
                        In addition, if S is a set of numbers, and k is a number, we sometimes use the notation kS

                    to indicate the set of numbers obtained by multiplying k to every number in S.

                    Example 2.1.8 The notation 2Z denotes the set of all even integers. Take note that an even
                    integer can be positive, negative, or even zero.

2.2 Conjunctions and Disjunctions

Given two real numbers x and y, we can form a new number by means of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, or division, denoted x + y, x - y, x · y, and x/y, respectively. The symbols +, -,
· , and / are binary operators because they all work on two operands. In fact, the negative
sign in -x can be regarded as a unary operator that changes the sign of x.

    In a similar manner, from one or more logical statements, we can form a compound state-
ment by joining them with logical operators, which are also called logical connectives
because they are used to connect logical statements. Obviously, negation is a unary operation.

    Since a compound statement is itself a statement, it is either true or false. Therefore, we
define a logical operation by describing the truth value of the resulting compound statement.
The first two binary operations we shall study are conjunction and disjunction. They perform
the "and" and "or" operations, respectively.

    name           meaning  notation  truth value
    conjunction    p and q    pq      true if both p and q are true, false otherwise
    disjunction     p or q    pq      false if both p and q are false, true otherwise

Their truth values are summarized in the following truth table:

                              p q pq pq

                              TT T                 T

                              TF F                 T

                              FT F                 T

                              FF F                 F

Example 2.2.1 Do not use mathematical notations as abbreviation in writing. For example,
do not write "x  y are real numbers" if you want to say "x and y are real numbers."

    In fact, the phrase "x  y are real numbers" is syntactically incorrect. Since  is a binary
logical operator, it is used to connect two logical statements. Here, the "x" before  is not a
logical statement. Therefore, we cannot write "x  y are real numbers."

    Incidentally, the statement "x and y are real numbers" is actually a conjunction. It means
"x is a real number and y is a real number," or symbolically,

                                                  (x  R)  (y  R).

It is wrong to write "x  y  R." Can you explain why?

Hands-On Exercise 2.2.1 Write "x and y are rational" as a conjunction, first in words, then
in mathematical symbols.

Example 2.2.2 The statement "New York is the largest state in the United States and New

York City is the state capital of New York" is clearly a conjunction. A conjunction of two

statements is true only when both statements are true. Since New York is not the largest state

in the United States, the conjunction is false.

    In general, in a conjunction of two statements, if the first statement is false, no further

consideration of the second statement is necessary since we know the conjunction must be false.

In computer science, this is referred to as the short circuit evaluation.

                                                      
Example 2.2.3 The statement " 30 is greater than 6 or 30 is less than 5" can be expressed

symbolically as                                  

                                30 > 6  30 < 5 .

                            
Both statements " 30 > 6" and " 30 < 5" are false. Hence, their disjunction is also false.

Example 2.2.4 Determine the truth values of the following statements:

      
(a) 30 > 5  30 > 7

          
(b) Either 30 < 5 or 30 > 7

                                 
Solution: (a) Since 30 > 5 is true, but 30 > 7 is false, their conjunction is false.

                               
(b) Since 30 < 5 is false, and 30 > 7 is also false, their disjunction is false.

Hands-On Exercise 2.2.2 Determine the truth values of the following statements:

        
(a) 30 < 5 and 30 > 7 .

      
(b) 30 > 5  30 < 7 .

Be sure to show your reasons.

Example 2.2.5 What does "0  x  1" really mean, logically?

Solution: It means the conjunction "(0  x)  (x  1)." Hence, given a real number x, to test       "0  x  1" means
whether 0  x  1, we have to check whether 0  x and x  1.                                         "0  x and x  1."

Hands-On Exercise 2.2.3 Write 5 < x < 8 as a conjunction.

Hands-On Exercise 2.2.4 Many students assume that they can negate "0  x  1" by                   The negation of
reversing the signs. However, neither "0  x  1" nor "0 > x > 1" is the correct negation.         "0  x  1" is not

syntactically correct, and it is always false. Can you explain why?

    In the everyday usage of most languages, when we say "p or q," we normally mean exclusive
or , which means either p or q is true, but not both. An example is "I either pass or fail this
course," which really means

                                 Either I pass this course or I fail this course.

Sometimes, as illustrated in the statement

                              Either you pass this course, or I pass this course.

the connective "or" can be interpreted as an inclusive or . The actual meaning of "or" in human
languages depends on the context. In mathematics, however, "or" always means inclusive or.

Summary and Review

    · The conjunction "p and q" is denoted "p  q". It is true only when both p and q are true.
    · The disjunction "p or q" is denoted "p  q". It is false only when both p and q are false.
    · The inequality "a < x < b" is actually a conjunction, it means "(a < x)  (x < b)".
    · Likewise, the phrase "x and y are rational" is also a conjunction, it means "x is rational

       and y is rational." Symbolically, we can write "x  Q  y  Q."

                                                      (c) 1.76  x < 5

 9. In volleyball it is important to know which team is serving, because a team scores a point
     only if that team is serving and wins a volley. If the serving team loses the volley, then
     the other team gets to serve. Thus, to keep score in a volleyball game between teams A
     and B, it may be useful to define propositional variables p and q, where p is true if team
     A is serving (hence false if team B is serving); and q is true if team A wins the current
     volley (hence false if team B wins it).

      (a) Give a formula that is true if team A scores a point and is false otherwise.
      (b) Give a formula that is true if team B scores a point and is false otherwise.
      (c) Give a formula that is true if the serving team loses the current volley and is false

            otherwise.
      (d) Give a formula whose truth value determines whether the serving team will serve

            again.

10. The exclusive or operation, denoted p q, means "p or q, but not both."

      (a) Express p q as a logic statement.
      (b) Construct the truth table for p q.

2.3 Implications

Most theorems in mathematics appear in the form of compound statements called conditional
and biconditional statements. We shall study biconditional statement in the next section. Con-
ditional statements are also called implications.

Definition. An implication is the compound statement of the form "if p, then q." It is
denoted p  q, which is read as "p implies q." It is false only when p is true and q is false, and
is true in all other situations.

                                                     p q pq
                                                     TT T
                                                     TF F
                                                     FT T
                                                     FF T

The statement p in an implication p  q is called its hypothesis, premise, or antecedent,

and q the conclusion of an implication or consequence of an implication.   

    Implications come in many disguised forms. There are several alternatives for saying p  q.
The most common ones are

    · p implies q,
    · p only if q,
    · q if p,
    · q, provided that p.

All of them mean p  q. The multiple ways of saying "p implies q" illustrates the importance
of having a precise mathematical notation.
42                                                                   Chapter 2 Logic

    Implications play a key role in logical argument. If an implication is known to be true,
then whenever the hypothesis is met, the consequence must be true as well. This is why an
implication is also called a conditional statement.

Example 2.3.1 The quadratic formula asserts that

                 b2 - 4ac > 0  ax2 + bx + c = 0 has two distinct real solutions.
Consequently, the equation x2 - 3x + 1 = 0 has two distinct real solutions because its coefficients
satisfy the inequality b2 - 4ac > 0.

Hands-On Exercise 2.3.1 More generally,
    · If b2 - 4ac > 0, then the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has two distinct real solutions. In fact,
       ax2 + bx + c = a(x - r1)(x - r2), where r1 = r2 are the two distinct roots.
    · If b2 - 4ac = 0, then the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has only one real solution r. In such
       an event, ax2 + bx + c = a(x - r)2. Consequently, we call r a repeated root.
    · If b2 - 4ac < 0, then the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has no real solution.

Use these results to determine how many solutions these equations have:
  (a) 4x2 + 12x + 9 = 0

  (b) 2x2 - 3x - 4 = 0

  (c) x2 + x = -1

Example 2.3.2 We have remarked earlier that many theorems in mathematics are in the form
of implications. Here is an example:

                                  If |r| < 1, then 1 + r + r2 + r3 + · · · = 1-r 1 .
It means, symbolically, |r| < 1  1 + r + r2 + r3 + · · · = 1-r 1 .

Hands-On Exercise 2.3.2  Express the following statement in symbol:
                               If x > y > 0, then x2 > y2.

Example 2.3.3 If a father promises his kids, "If tomorrow is sunny, we will go to the beach,"
the kids will take it as a true statement. Consequently, if they wake up the next morning and
find it sunny outside, they expect they will go to the beach. The father breaks his promise
(hence making the implication false) only when it is sunny but he does not take his kids to the
beach.

    If it is cloudy outside the next morning, they do not know whether they will go to the beach,
because no conclusion can be drawn from the implication (their father's promise) if the weather
is bad. Nonetheless, they may still go to the beach, even if it rains! Since their father does not
contradict his promise, the implication is still true.

    Many students are bothered by the validity of an implication even when the hypothesis is
false. It may help if we understand how we use an implication. Assume we want to show that
a certain statement q is true.
2.3 Implications                                                   43

  (i) First, we find a result of the form p  q. If we cannot find one, we have to prove that         We can use a
       p  q is true.                                                                                 counterexample to
                                                                                                     disprove a claim.
  (ii) Next, show that the hypothesis p is fulfilled.
 (iii) These two steps together allow us to draw the conclusion that q must be true.

Accordingly, if p is false, we are not expected to use the implication p  q at all. Since we are
not are going to use it, we can define its truth value to anything we like. Nonetheless, we have
to maintain consistency with other logical connectives. We will give a justification of our choice
at the end of the next section.

Example 2.3.4 To show that "if x = 2, then x2 = 4" is true, we need not worry about those
x-values that are not equal to 2, because the implication is immediately true if x = 2. It suffices
to assume that x = 2, and try to prove that we will get x2 = 4. Since we do have x2 = 4 when
x = 2, the validity of the implication is established.

    In contrast, to determine whether the implication "if x2 = 4, then x = 2" is true, we assume
x2 = 4, and try to determine whether x must be 2. Since x = -2 makes x2 = 4 true but x = 2
false, the implication is false.

    In general, to disprove an implication, it suffices to find a counterexample that makes the
hypothesis true and the conclusion false.

Hands-On Exercise 2.3.3 Determine whether these two statements are true or false:

  (a) If (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, then x = 2.

  (b) If x = 2, then (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0.

Explain.

Example 2.3.5 Although we said examples can be used to disprove a claim, examples alone              Examples cannot
can never be used as proofs. If you are asked to show that                                           be used as proofs.

                                                if x > 2, then x2 > 4,

you cannot prove it by checking just a few values of x, because you may find a counterexample
after trying a few more calculations. Therefore, examples are only for illustrative purposes, they
are not acceptable as proofs.

Example 2.3.6 The statement

             "If a triangle P QR is isosceles, then two of its angles have equal measure."

takes the form of an implication p  q, where

                    p : The triangle P QR is isosceles
                    q : Two of the angles of the triangle P QR have equal measure

In this example, we have to rephrase the statements p and q, because each of them should be
a stand-alone statement. If we leave q as "two of its angles have equal measure," it is not clear
what "its" is referring to. In addition, it is a good habit to spell out the details. It helps us
focus our attention on what we are investigating.

Example 2.3.7  The statement
                         "A square must also be a parallelogram."
44                                                       Chapter 2 Logic

can be expressed as an implication: "if the quadrilateral P QRS is a square, then the quadrilat-
eral P QRS is a parallelogram."

    Likewise, the statement

                                "All isosceles triangles have two equal angles."

can be rephrased as "if the triangle P QR is isosceles, then the triangle P QR has two equal
angles." Since we have expressed the statement in the form of an implication, we no longer need
to include the word "all."

Hands-On Exercise 2.3.4 Rewrite each of these logical statements:

  (a) Any square is also a parallelogram.

(b) A prime number is an integer.

(c) All polynomials are differentiable.

as an implication p  q. Specify what p and q are.

Example 2.3.8 What does "p unless q" translate into, logically speaking? We know that p is
true, provided that q does not happen. It means, in symbol, q  p. Therefore,

                                    The quadrilateral P QRS is not a square
                              unless the quadrilateral P QRS is a parallelogram

is the same as saying

                               If a quadrilateral P QRS is not a parallelogram,
                                then the quadrilateral P QRS is not a square.

Equivalently, "p unless q" means p  q, because q is a necessary condition that prevents p from
happening.

    Given an implication p  q, we define three related implications:
    · Its converse is defined as q  p.
    · Its inverse is defined as p  q.
    · Its contrapositive is defined as q  p.

Among them, the contrapositive q  p is the most important one. We shall study it again in
the next section.

Example 2.3.9  The converse, inverse, and contrapositive of "x > 2  x2 > 4" are listed
below.

               converse:                 x2 > 4  x > 2,

               inverse:                  x  2  x2  4,

               contrapositive: x2  4  x  2.

We can change the notation when we negate a statement. If it is appropriate, we may even
rephrase a sentence to make the negation more readable.
2.3 Implications                    45

Hands-On Exercise 2.3.5 List the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of the statement "if
                     

p is prime, then p is irrational."

    The inverse of an implication is seldom used in mathematics, so we will only study the truth
values of the converse and contrapositive.

                  p q pq qp q p qp

                  TT T  T FF T
                  TF F  T TF F
                  FT T  F FT T
                  FF T  T TT T

An implication and its contrapositive always have the same truth value, but this is not true for
the converse. What this means is, even though we know p  q is true, there is no guarantee
that q  p is also true. This is an important observation, especially when we have a theorem
stated in the form of an implication. So let us say it again:

              The converse of a theorem in the form of an implication may not be true.

Accordingly, if you only know that p  q is true, do not assume that its converse q  p is also
true. Likewise, if you are asked to prove that p  q is true, do not attempt to prove q  p,
because these two implications are not the same.

Example 2.3.10 We know that p  q does not necessarily mean we also have q  p. This
important observation explains the invalidity of the "proof" of 21 = 6 in Example 1.4.3.

                        21 = 6
                         6 = 21

                        27 = 27

The argument we use here consists of three equations, but they are not individual unrelated
equations. They are connected by implication.

                        21 = 6

                        6 = 21

                   27 = 27

Since implications are not reversible, even though we do have 27 = 27, we cannot use this fact
to prove that 21 = 6. After all, an implication is true if its hypothesis is false. Therefore, having
a true implication does not mean that its hypothesis must be true. In this example, the logic is
sound, but it does not prove that 21 = 6.

    There are two other ways to describe an implication p  q in words. They are completely
different from the ones we have seen thus far. They focus on whether we can tell one of the two
components p and q is true or false if we know the truth value of the other.
46  Chapter 2 Logic

    · p is a sufficient condition for q
    · q is a necessary condition for p.

They are difficult to remember, and can be easily confused. You may want to visualize it
pictorially:

                                  sufficient condition  necessary condition.

The idea is, assuming that p  q is true, then
    · For q to be true, it is enough to know or show that p is true. Hence, knowing p is true
       alone is sufficient for us to draw the conclusion the q must also be true.
    · For p to be true, it is necessary to have q be true as well. Thus, knowing q is true does
       not necessarily mean that p must be true.

Example 2.3.11 Consider the implication

                                                    x = 1  x2 = 1.

If x = 1, we must have x2 = 1. So, knowing x = 1 is enough for us to conclude that x2 = 1. We
say that x = 1 is a sufficient condition for x2 = 1.

    If x = 1, it is necessarily true that x2 = 1, because, for example, it is impossible to have
x2 = 2. Nonetheless, knowing x2 = 1 alone is not enough for us to decide whether x = 1,
because x can be -1. Therefore, x2 = 1 is not a sufficient condition for x = 1. Instead, x2 = 1
is only a necessary condition for x = 1.

Hands-On Exercise 2.3.6 Write these statements:

  (a) For x2 > 1, it is sufficient that x > 1.

  (b) For x2 > 1, it is necessary that x > 1.

in the form of p  q. Be sure to specify what p and q are.

Summary and Review

    · An implication p  q is false only when p is true and q is false.
    · This is how we typically use an implication. Assume we want to show that q is true. We

       have to find or prove a theorem that says p  q. Next, we need to show that hypothesis

       p is met, hence it follows that q must be true.
    · An implication can be described in several other ways. Can you name a few of them?
    · Converse, inverse, and contrapositive are obtained from an implication by switching the

       hypothesis and the consequence, sometimes together with negation.
    · In an implication p  q, the component p is called the sufficient condition, and the

       component q is called the necessary condition.

2.4 Biconditional Statements

The biconditional statement "p if and only if q," denoted p  q, is true when both p and q
carry the same truth value, and is false otherwise. It is sometimes abbreviated as "p iff q." Its
truth table is depicted below.

Example 2.4.1 The following biconditional statements
   · 2x - 5 = 0  x = 5/2,
   · x > y  x - y > 0,
2.4 Biconditional Statements                                           49

are true, because, in both examples, the two statements joined by  are true or false simulta-
neously.

    A biconditional statement can also be defined as the compound statement

                                                  (p  q)  (q  p).

This explains why we call it a biconditional statement. A biconditional statement is often used
to define a new concept.

Example 2.4.2  A number is even if and only if it is a multiple of 2. Mathematically, this
means                       n is even  n = 2q for some integer q.

It follows that for any integer m,

                                    mn = m · 2q = 2(mq).

Since mq is an integer (because it is a product of two integers), by definition, mn is even. This
shows that the product of any integer with an even integer is always even.

Hands-On Exercise 2.4.1 Complete the following statement:

               n is odd                                             .

Use this to prove that if n is odd, then n2 is also odd.

Example 2.4.3 The operation "exclusive or" can be defined as

                                              p q  (p  q)  (p  q).
See Problem 10 in Exercises 2.2.

    When we have a complex statement involving more than one logical operation, care must be
taken to determine which operation should be carried out first. The precedence or priority is
listed below.

                                    Connectives  Priority
                                          ¬      Highest
                                          
                                                     ..
                                                     .
                                          
                                                 Lowest

This is the order in which the operations should be carried out if the logical expression is read
from left to right. To override the precedence, use parentheses.

Example 2.4.4 The precedence of logical operations can be compared to those of arithmetic
operations.

For example, yz-3 = (yz)-3. To evaluate yz-3, we have to perform exponentiation first. Hence,
yz-3 = y · z-3 = yz3 .

    Another example: the notation x23 means x raised to the power of 23, hence x23 = x8; it

should not be interpreted as (x2)3, because (x2)3 = x6.

Example 2.4.5 It is not true that p  q can be written as "p  q  q  p," because it would
mean, technically,

                                                   p  (q  q)  p.

The correct notation is (p  q)  (q  p).

Hands-On Exercise 2.4.2 Insert parentheses in the following formula

to identify the proper procedure for evaluating its truth value. Construct its truth table.

Hands-On Exercise 2.4.3 Insert parentheses in the following formula

to identify the proper procedure for evaluating its truth value. Construct its truth table.

    We close this section with a justification of our choice in the truth value of p  q when p is
false. The truth value of p  q is obvious when p is true.

                                                     p q pq

                                                     FT ?
                                                     FF ?
We want to decide what are the best choices for the two missing values so that they are consistent
with the other logical connectives. Observe that if p  q is true, and q is false, then p must be
false as well, because if p were true, with q being false, then the implication p  q would have
been false. For instance, if we promise
2.4 Biconditional Statements                                     51

                               "If tomorrow is sunny, we will go to the beach"

but we do not go to the beach tomorrow, then we know tomorrow must not be sunny. This
means the two statements p  q and q  p should share the same truth value.

    When both p and q are false, then both p and q are true. Hence, q  p should be true,
consequently so is p  q. Thus far, we have the following partially completed truth table:

                                                     p q pq
                                                     TT T
                                                     TF F
                                                     FT ?
                                                     FF T

If the last missing entry is F, the resulting truth table would be identical to that of p  q. To
distinguish p  q from p  q, we have to define p  q to be true in this case.

Summary and Review

    · A biconditional statement p  q is the combination of the two implications p  q and
       q  p.

    · The biconditional statement p  q is true when both p and q have the same truth value,
       and is false otherwise.

    · A biconditional statement is often used in defining a notation or a mathematical concept.

Exercises 2.4

   1. Let p, q, and r represent the following statements:

                                       p: Sam had pizza last night.
                                       q: Chris finished her homework.
                                       r: Pat watched the news this morning.

       Give a formula (using appropriate symbols) for each of these statements.

        (a) Sam had pizza last night if and only if Chris finished her homework.
        (b) Pat watched the news this morning iff Sam did not have pizza last night.
         (c) Pat watched the news this morning if and only if Chris finished her homework and

              Sam did not have pizza last night.
        (d) In order for Pat to watch the news this morning, it is necessary and sufficient that

              Sam had pizza last night and Chris finished her homework.

   2. Define the propositional variables as in Problem 1. Express in words the statements
       represented by the following formulas:

(a) q  r                               (b) p  (q  r)
(c) p  (q  r)                          (d) r  (p  q)

3. Consider the following statements:

p: Niagara Falls is in New York.
q: New York City is the state capital of New York.
r: New York City will have more than 40 inches of snow in 2525.

The statement p is true, and the statement q is false. Represent each of the following
statements by a formula. What is their truth value if r is true? What if r is false?
52  Chapter 2 Logic

         (a) Niagara Falls is in New York if and only if New York City is the state capital of New
              York.

        (b) Niagara Falls is in New York iff New York City will have more than 40 inches of snow
              in 2525.

         (c) Niagara Falls is in New York or New York City is the state capital of New York if
              and only if New York City will have more than 40 inches of snow in 2525.

    4. Express each of the following compound statements symbolically:

         (a) The product xy = 0 if and only if either x = 0 or y = 0.
        (b) The integer n = 4 if and only if 7n - 5 = 23.
         (c) A necessary condition for x = 2 is x4 - x2 - 12 = 0.
        (d) A sufficient condition for x = 2 is x4 - x2 - 12 = 0.
         (e) For x4 - x2 - 12 = 0, it is both sufficient and necessary to have x = 2.
         (f) The sum of squares x2 + y2 > 1 iff both x and y are greater than 1.

    5. Determine the truth values of the following statements (assuming that x and y are real
       numbers):

         (a) The product xy = 0 if and only if either x = 0 or y = 0.
        (b) The sum of squares x2 + y2 > 1 iff both x and y are greater than 1.
         (c) x2 - 4x + 3 - 0  x = 3.
        (d) x2 > y2  x > y.

    6. Determine the truth values of the following statements (assuming that x and y are real
       numbers):

         (a) u is a vowel if and only if b is a consonant.
        (b) x2 + y2 = 0 if and only if x = 0 and y = 0.
         (c) x2 - 4x + 4 = 0 if and only if x = 2.
        (d) xy = 0 if and only if x and y are both positive.

    7. We have seen that a number n is even if and only if n = 2q for some integer q. Accordingly,
       what can you say about an odd number?

    8. We also say that an integer n is even if it is divisible by 2, hence it can be written as
       n = 2q for some integer q, where q represents the quotient when n is divided by 2. Thus,
       n is even if it is a multiple of 2. What if the integer n is a multiple of 3? What form must
       it take? What if n is not a multiple of 3?

2.5 Logical Equivalences

A tautology is a proposition that is always true, regardless of the truth values of the propo-
sitional variables it contains. A proposition that is always false is called a contradiction. A
proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is called a contingency .

Example 2.5.1 From the following truth table

                                                  p p pp pp
                                                 TF T F
                                                 FT T F

we gather that p  p is a tautology, and p  p is a contradiction.
    In words, p  p says that either the statement p is true, or the statement p is true (that is, p

is false). This claim is always true.
    The compound statement p  p claims that p is true, and at the same time, p is also true

(which means p is false). This is clearly impossible. Hence, p  p must be false.
2.5 Logical Equivalences                                                               53

Example 2.5.2 Show that (p  q)  (q  p) is a tautology.

Solution: We can use a truth table to verify the claim.

p q p  q q p q  p (p  q)  (q  p)

FF T TT T                                                T

Note how we work on each component of the compound statement separately before putting
them together to obtain the final answer.

Example 2.5.3 Show that the argument
                      "If p and q, then r. Therefore, if not r, then not p or not q."

is valid. In other words, show that the logic used in the argument is correct.

Solution: Symbolically, the argument says

                          [(p  q)  r]  [r  (p  q)].                                    (2.1)

We want to show that it is a tautology. It is easy to verify with a truth table. We can also argue
that this compound statement is always true by showing that it can never be false.

    Suppose, tn the contrary, that (2.1) is false for some choices of p, q, and r. Then

(p  q)  r must be true, and r  (p  q) must be false.

For the second implication to be false, we need

r to be true, and p  q to be false.

They in turn imply that r is false, and both p and q are false; hence both p and q are true. This
would make (p  q)  r false, contradicting the assumption that it is true. Thus, (2.1) cannot
be false, it must be a tautology.

Hands-On Exercise 2.5.1 Use a truth table to show that

                                            [(p  q)  r]  [r  (p  q)]

is a tautology.

Solution: We need eight combinations of truth values in p, q, and r. We list the truth values
according to the following convention. In the first column for the truth values of p, fill the upper
half with T and the lower half with F. In the next column for the truth values of q, repeat the
same pattern, separately, with the upper half and the lower half. So we split the upper half of
the second column into two halves, fill the top half with T and the lower half with F. Likewise,
split the lower half of the second column into two halves, fill the top half with T and the lower
half with F. Repeat the same pattern with the third column for the truth values of r, and so on
if we have more propositional variables. Complete the following table:

           p q r p  q (p  q)  r r p q p  q r  (p  q) [(p  q)  r]  [r  (p  q)]

                      Question: If there are four propositional variables in a proposition, how many rows are there in
                      the truth table?

                      Definition. Two logical formulas p and q are said to be logically equivalent, denoted

                                               p  q,

                      if p  q is a tautology.                                                                

Do not write p = q;       We are not saying that p is equal to q. Since p and q represent two different statements,
instead, write p  q.  they cannot be the same. What we are saying is, they always produce the same truth value,
                      regardless of the truth values of the underlying propositional variables. That is why we write
                      p  q instead of p = q.

                      Example 2.5.4 We have learned that
                                                                  p  q  (p  q)  (q  p),

                      which is the reason why we call p  q a biconditional statement.

                      Example 2.5.5 Use truth tables to verify the following equivalent statements.

                       (a) p  q  p  q.
                       (b) p  (q  r)  (p  q)  (p  r).

Properties of Logical Equivalence. Denote by T and F a tautology and a contradiction,

logical equivalences.
Memorize them!           10. Writing an implication as a disjunction: p  q  p  q.

                       Be sure you memorize the last two equivalences, because we will use them frequently in the rest
                       of the course.

                       Remark. These properties are not easy to recall. Instead of focusing on the symbolic formulas,
                       try to understand their meanings. Let us explain them in words, and compare them to similar
                       operations on the real numbers,

                          1. Commutative properties: In short, they say that "the order of operation does not
                              matter." It does not matter which of the two logical statements comes first, the result
                              from conjunction and disjunction always produces the same truth value. Compare this to
                              addition of real numbers: x + y = y + x. Subtraction is not commutative, because it is not
                              always true that x - y = y - x. This explains why we have to make sure that an operation
                              is commutative.

                          2. Associative properties: Roughly speaking, these properties also say that "the order
                              of operation does not matter." However, there is a key difference between them and the
                              commutative properties.

                                  · Commutative properties apply to operations on two logical statements, but associa-
                                     tive properties involves three logical statements. Since  and  are binary operations,
                                     we can only work on a pair of statements at a time. Given the three statements p,
                                     q, and r, appearing in that order, which pair of statements should we operate on
                                     first? The answer is: it does not matter. It is the order of grouping (hence the term
                                     associative) that does not matter in associative properties.

                                  · The important consequence of the associative property is: since it does not matter
                                     on which pair of statements we should carry out the operation first, we can eliminate
                                     the parentheses and write, for example,

                                                                                       pqr

                                     without worrying about any confusion.
                                  · Not all operations are associative. Subtraction is not associative. Given three num-

                                     bers 5, 7, and 4, in that order, how should we carry out two subtractions? Which
                                     interpretation should we use:

                                                                     (5 - 7) - 4, or 5 - (7 - 4)?

                                     Since they lead to different results, we have to be careful where to place the paren-
                                     theses.

                          3. Distributive laws: When we mix two different operations on three logical statements,
                              one of them has to work on a pair of statements first, forming an "inner" operation. This
                              is followed by the "outer" operation to complete the compound statement. Distributive
                              laws say that we can distribute the "outer" operation over the inner one.

                          4. Idempotent laws: When an operation is applied to a pair of identical logical statements,
                              the result is the same logical statement. Compare this to the equation x2 = x, where x is
                              a real number. It is true only when x = 0 or x = 1. But the logical equivalences p  p  p
                              and p  p  p are true for all p.

                          5. De Morgan's laws: When we negate a disjunction (respectively, a conjunction), we
                              have to negate the two logical statements, and change the operation from disjunction to
                              conjunction (respectively, from conjunction to a disjunction).
2.5 Logical Equivalences                    57

6. Laws of the excluded middle, or inverse laws: Any statement is either true or false,
   hence p  p is always true. Likewise, a statement cannot be both true and false at the
   same time, hence p  p is always false.

7. Identity laws: Compare them to the equation x · 1 = x: the value of x is unchanged after
   multiplying by 1. We call the number 1 the multiplicative identity. For logical operations,
   the identity for disjunction is F, and the identity for conjunction is T.

8. Domination laws: Compare them to the equation x · 0 = 0 for real numbers: the result

is always 0, regardless of the value x. The "zero" for disjunction is T, and the "zero" for

conjunction is F.                           

Example 2.5.6 What is the negation of 2  x  3? Give a logical explanation as well as a
graphical explanation.

Solution: The inequality 2  x  3 means
                                                   (2  x)  (x  3).

Its negation, according to De Morgan's laws, is
                                                   (2 > x)  (x > 3).

The inequality 2  x  3 yields a closed interval. Its negation yields two open intervals. Their
graphical representations on the real number line are depicted below.

Take note of the two endpoints 2 and 3. They change from inclusion to exclusion when we take
negation.

"0 > x or x > 1," which is often written as "x < 0 or x > 1." Explain why it is inappropriate,
and indeed incorrect, to write "0 > x > 1."

Example 2.5.7 Expand (p  q)  (r  s).

Solution: Compare this problem to the expansion of (x + y)(u + v). We use the distributive
law twice to obtain

                                    (x + y)(u + v) = x(u + v) + y(u + v)
                                                          = xu + xv + yu + yv.

Let us follow the same procedure to expand (p  q)  (r  s). We need to apply the distributive
law twice. The first time, regard (r  s) as a single statement, and distribute it over p  q. In the
second round, distribute p and q, separately, over r  s. The complete solution is shown below.

                         (p  q)  (r  s)  [p  (r  s)]  [q  (r  s)]
                                                  (p  r)  (p  s)  (q  r)  (q  s).

                      We can also proceed as follows:
                                               (p  q)  (r  s)  [(p  q)  r]  [(p  q)  s]
                                                                        (p  r)  (q  r)  (p  s)  (q  s).

                      The two results are identical because  is commutative.

                      Hands-On Exercise 2.5.5 Expand (p  q)  (r  s).

                      Example 2.5.8 We have used a truth table to verify that

                          [(p  q)  r]  [r  (p  q)]

                      is a tautology. We can use the properties of logical equivalence to show that this compound
                      statement is logically equivalent to T . This kind of proof is usually more difficult to follow, so
                      it is a good idea to supply the explanation in each step. Here is a complete proof:

                      [(p  q)  r]  [r  (p  q)]  (p  q)  r  [r  (p  q)] (implication as disjunction)

                           (p  q)  r  [p  q  r] (implication as disjunction)

                           (p  q)  r  [(p  q)  r] (De Morgan's law)

                      This is precisely what we called the left-to-right method for proving an identity (in this case, a

                      either. Instead, since p  q  p  q, it follows from De Morgan's law that

                      Alternatively, we can argue as follows. Interpret p  q as saying p  q is false. This requires p
                      to be true and q to be false, which translates into p  q. Thus, p  q  p  q.

2.6 Logical Quantifiers

The expression

                                      x>5

is neither true nor false. In fact, we cannot even determine its truth value unless we know the
value of x. This is an example of a propositional function, because it behaves like a function
of x, it becomes a proposition when a specific value is assigned to x. Propositional functions are
also called predicates.

Example 2.6.1 Denote the propositional function "x > 5" by p(x). We often write

                                                     p(x) : x > 5.

It is not a proposition because its truth value is undecidable, but p(6), p(3) and p(-1) are
propositions.

Example 2.6.2 Define

                           q(x, y) : x + y = 1.

Which of the following are propositions; which are not?

(a) q(x, y)
(b) q(x, 3)
(c) q(1, 1)
(d) q(5, -4)

For those that are, determine their truth values.

Solution: Both (a) and (b) are not propositions, because they contain at least one variable.
Both (c) and (d) are propositions; q(1, 1) is false, and q(5, -4) is true.

    Although a propositional function is not a proposition, we can form a proposition by means
of quantification. The idea is to specify whether the propositional function is true for all or
for some values that the underlying variables can take on.

The symbol  is called the universal quantifier , and can be extended to several variables. 

Example 2.6.3 The statement
                              "For any real number x, we always have x2  0"

is true. Symbolically, we can write
                              x  R (x2  0), or x (x  R  x2  0).

The second form is a bit wordy, but could be useful in some situations.

Example 2.6.4 The statement

                             x  R (x > 5)

is false because x is not always greater than 5. To disprove a claim, it suffices to provide only

one counterexample. We can use x = 4 as a counterexample.

However, examples cannot be used to prove a universally quantified statement. Consider the

statement

                             x  R (x2  0).

By direct calculations, one may demonstrate that x2  0 is true for many x-values. But it does
not prove that it is true for every x, because there may be a counterexample that we have not
found yet. We have to use mathematical and logical argument to prove a statement of the form
"x p(x)."

Example 2.6.5 The statement
            "Every Discrete Mathematics student has taken Calculus I and Calculus II"

is clearly a universally quantified proposition. To express it in a logical formula, we can use an
implication:

       x (x is a Discrete Mathematics student  x has taken Calculus I and Calculus II)

An alternative is to say

                               x  S (x has taken Calculus I and Calculus II)

where S represents the set of all Discrete Mathematics students. Although the second form
looks simpler, we must define what S stands for.

                        Definition. The existential quantification of p(x) takes one of these forms:
                            · There exists an x such that p(x).
                            · For some x, p(x).
                            · There is some x such that p(x).

Write , not E.          We write, in symbol,

One example suffices                                             x p(x),
to prove a statement
of the form " x p(x)."  which is pronounced as

                                                "There exists x such that p(x)."

                        The symbol  is called the existential quantifier . It can be extended to several variables. 

                        Example 2.6.6 To prove that a statement of the form "x p(x)" is true, it suffices to find an
                        example of x such that p(x) is true. Using this guideline, can you determine whether these two
                        propositions

                          (a) x  R (x > 5)
                                          

                          (b) x  R ( x = 0)

                        are true?

                        Solution: (a) True. For example: x = 6.
                        (b) True. For example: x = 0.

                        Example 2.6.7 The proposition
                                             "There exists a prime number x such that x + 2 is also prime"

                        is true. We call such a pair of primes twin primes.

                        Hands-On Exercise 2.6.2 Name a few more examples of twin primes.

                        Example 2.6.8 The proposition
                                                       "There exists a real number x such that x > 5"

                        can be expressed, symbolically, as
                                                        x  R (x > 5), or x (x  R  x > 5).

                        Notice that in an existential quantification, we use  instead of  to specify that x is a real
                        number.

                          (a) For any prime number x, the number x + 1 is composite.

                          (b) For any prime number x > 2, the number x + 1 is composite.

(c) There exists an integer k such that 2k + 1 is even.

(d) For all integers k, the integer 2k is even.

(e) For any real number x, if x2 is an integer, then x is also an integer.

Hands-On Exercise 2.6.4 The proposition
                                 "The square of any real number is positive"

is a universal quantification
                                        "For any real number x, x2 > 0."

Is it true or false?

Example 2.6.9 When multiple quantifiers are present, the order in which they appear is
important. Determine whether these two statements are true or false.

  (a) x  Z y  R (xy < 1)
  (b) y  R x  Z (xy < 1)
Here, R denotes the set of all nonzero real numbers.

Solution: (a) To prove that the statement is true, we need to show that no matter what integer

x we start with, we can always find a nonzero real number y such that xy < 1. For x  0, we

can  pick  y  =  1,  which  makes  xy  =  x    0  <  1.  For  x  >  0,  let  y  =  x+1 1 ,  then  xy  =    x  <  1.  This
                                                                                                         x+1

concludes the proof that the first statement is true.

(b) Let y = 1. Can we find an integer x such that xy  1? Definitely! For example, we can set
x = 2. This counterexample shows that the second statement is false.

Hands-On Exercise 2.6.5 True or false: y  R x  Z (xy < 1)?

Example 2.6.10 Many theorems in mathematics can be expressed as quantified statements.
Consider

                      "If x is rational and y is irrational, then x + y is irrational."

This is same as saying
                      64  Chapter 2 Logic

Recall how to negate                   "Whenever x is rational and y is irrational, then x + y is irrational."
an implication.
                      The keyword "whenever" suggests that we should use a universal quantifier.

                                               x, y (x is rational  y is irrational  x + y is irrational).

                      It can also be written as
                                                             x  Q y / Q (x + y is irrational).

                      Although this form looks complicated and seems difficult to understand (primarily because it
                      is quite symbolic, hence appears to be abstract and incomprehensible to many students), it
                      provides an easy form for negation. See the discussion below.

                          The fact that an implication can be expressed as a universally quantified statement sounds
                      familiar. See Example 2.3.7.

                          We shall learn several basic proof techniques in Chapter 3. Some of them require negating
                      a logical statement. Since many mathematical results are stated as quantified statements, it is
                      necessary for us to learn how to negate a quantification. The rule is rather simple. Interchange
                       and , and negate the statement that is being quantified. In other words,

                                                    x p(x)  x p(x), and x p(x)  x p(x).

                      If we have x  Z, we only change it to x  Z when we take negation. It should not be negated
                      as x  Z. The reason is: we are only negating the quantification, not the membership of x. In
                      symbols, we write

                                                                   x  Z p(x)  x  Z p(x).
                      The negation of "x  Z p(x)" is obtained in a similar manner.

                      Example 2.6.11 We find

                                                  x  Z y  R (xy < 1)  x  Z y  R (xy  1),

                      and
                                                  y  R x  Z (xy < 1)  y  R x  Z (xy  1).

                      Remember that we do not change the membership of x and y.

                      can be written as, symbolically, x  R (x2  0). Its negation is x  R (x2 < 0). In words, it

Summary and Review

    · There are two ways to quantify a propositional function: universal quantification and
       existential quantification.

    · They are written in the form of "x p(x)" and "x p(x)" respectively.
    · To negate a quantified statement, change  to , and  to , and then negate the statement.

Exercises 2.6

   1. Consider these propositional functions:

                         p(n):                 n is prime
                         q(n):                 n is even
                         r(n):                 n>2

   Express these formulas in words:                                                               Recall that the set of

     (a) n  Z (p(n)  q(n))                                                                        be written as 2Z.

          is true.
     (c) For all integers x, there exists an integer y such that if p(x, y) is true, then there

          exists an integer z so that q(x, y, z) is true.

       of this formula, and (iii) express the negation in words.

    (a) For all real numbers x and y, x + y = y + x.
    (b) For every positive real number x there exists a real number y such that y2 = x.
    (c) There exists a real number y such that, for every integer x, 2x2 + 1 > x2y.

    8. For each statement, (i) represent it as a formula, (ii) find the negation (in simplest form)

                                     "A square must be a parallelogram"

    is to say

                           "It is not true that a square must be a parallelogram."

    Yet, it is not the same as saying

                           "A square must not be a parallelogram."

     Can you explain why? What are other ways to express its negation in words?

Proof Techniques

3.1 An Introduction to Proof Techniques

A proof is a logical argument that verifies the validity of a statement. A good proof must
be correct, but it also needs to be clear enough for others to understand. In the following
sections, we want to show you how to write mathematical arguments. It takes practice to learn
how to write mathematical proofs; you have to keep trying! We would like to start with some
suggestions.

   1. Write at the level of your peers. A common question asked by many students is: how
       much detail should I include in a proof? One simple guideline is to write at the level that
       your peers can understand. Although you can skip the detailed computation, be sure to
       include the major steps in an argument.

   2. Use symbols and notations appropriately. Do not use mathematical symbols as
       abbreviations. For example, do not write "x is a number > 4." Use "x is a number greater
       than 4" instead. Do not use symbols excessively either. It is often clearer if we express
       our idea in words. Finally, do not start a sentence with a symbol, as in "Suppose xy > 0.
       x and y have the same signs." It would look better if we combine the two sentences, and
       write "Suppose xy > 0, then x and y have the same signs."

   3. Display long and important equations separately. Make the key mathematical
       results stand out by displaying them separately on their own. Be sure to center these
       expressions. Number them if you need to refer to them later. See Examples 1.3.1 and 1.3.2.

   4. Write in complete sentences, with proper usage of grammar and punctuation.
       A proof is, after all, a piece of writing. It should conform to the usual writing rules. Use
       complete sentences, and do not forget to check the grammar and punctuation.

   5. Start with a draft. Prepare a draft. When you feel it is correct, start revising it:
       check the accuracy, remove redundancy, and simplify the sentence structure. Organize the
       argument into short paragraphs to enhance the readability of a proof. Go over the proof
       and refine it further.

    Some proofs only require direct computation.

Example 3.1.1 Let a and b be two rational numbers such that a < b. Show that the weighted

average  1  a+  2  b  is  a  rational  number   between   a  and   b.
         3      3

Solution:   Since     a  and  b  are  rational  numbers,  we  can  write  a  =  m  and  b  =  p  for  some  integers
                                                                                n             q

m, n, p, and q, where n, q = 0. Then

                                      1 2 1 m 2 p mq + 2np
                                       a+ b= · + · =
                                      3 3 3 n 3q                          3nq
68                                                                               Chapter 3 Proof Techniques

is clearly a rational number because mq + 2np and 3np are integers, and 3nq = 0. Since a < b,
we know b - a > 0. It follows that

                                               12                    2
                                               a + b - a = (b - a) > 0,
                                               33                    3

which    means      1  a+  2  b  >  a.  In  a  similar  fashion,  we     also  find  1  a+  2  b   <   b.  Thus,  1  a+  2  b  is  a

    Sometimes, we can use a constructive proof when a proposition claims that certain values
or quantities exist.

Example 3.1.2 Prove that every positive integer can be written in the form of 2et for some
nonnegative integer e and some odd integer t.

Remark. The problem statement only says "every positive integer." It often helps if we

assign a name to the integer; it will make it easier to go through the discussion. Consequently,

we customarily start a proof with the phrase "Let n be . . . "                                                                     

Solution: Let n be a positive integer. Keep dividing n by 2 until an odd number t remains.

Let e be the number of times we factor out a copy of 2. It is clear that e is nonnegative, and we
have found n = 2et.

Hands-On Exercise 3.1.2 Express 6, 40, 32, and 15 in the form stated in Example 3.1.2.

Example 3.1.3 Given any positive integer n, show that there exist n consecutive composite
positive integers.

Solution: For each positive integer n, we claim that the n consecutive integers
                 (n + 1)! + 2, (n + 1)! + 3, . . . (n + 1)! + n, (n + 1)! + (n + 1)

are composite. Here is the reason. For each i, where 2  i  n + 1, the integer
                       (n + 1)! + i = 1 · 2 · 3 · · · (i - 1)i(i + 1) · · · (n + 1) + i
                                         = i [ 1 · 2 · 3 · · · (i - 1)(i + 1) · · · (n + 1) + 1 ]

is divisible by i and greater than i, and hence is composite.

Hands-On Exercise 3.1.3 Construct five consecutive positive integers that are composite.
Verify their compositeness by means of factorization.

Example 3.1.4 Let m and n be positive integers. Show that, if mn is even, then an m × n
chessboard can be fully covered by non-overlapping dominoes.

Remark. This time, the names m and n have already been assigned to the two positive
integers. Thus, we can refer to them in the proof without an introduction.

Solution: Since mn is even, one of the two integers m and n must be even. Without loss of
generality (since the other case is similar), we may assume m, the number of rows, is even. Then
m = 2t for some integer t. Each column can be filled with m/2 = t non-overlapping dominoes
placed vertically. As a result, the entire chessboard can be covered with nt non-overlapping
vertical dominoes.

Hands-On Exercise 3.1.4 Show that, between any two rational numbers a and b, where a < b,
there exists another rational number.
Hint: Try the midpoint of the interval [a, b].

Hands-On Exercise 3.1.5 Show that, between any two rational numbers a and b, where a < b,
there exists another rational number closer to b than to a.
Hint: Use a weighted average of a and b.

    Sometimes a non-constructive proof can be used to show the existence of a certain quantity
that satisfies some conditions. We have learned two such existence theorems from calculus.
Theorem 3.1.1 (Mean Value Theorem) Let f be a differentiable function defined over a
closed interval [a, b]. Then there exists a number c strictly inside the open interval (a, b) such
that f (c) = b-a f(b)-f(a) .
Theorem 3.1.2 (Intermediate Value Theorem) Let f be a function that is continuous over
a closed interval [a, b]. Then f assumes all values between f (a) and f (b). In other words, for
any value t between f (a) and f (b), there exists a number c inside [a, b] such that f (c) = t.

    Both results only guarantee the existence of a number c with some specific property; they
do not tell us how to find this number c. Nevertheless, the Mean-Value Theorem plays a very
important role in analysis; many of its applications are beyond the scope of this course. We
could, however, demonstrate an application of the Intermediate Value Theorem.
Corollary 3.1.3 Let f be a continuous function defined over a closed interval [a, b]. If f (a)
and f (b) have opposite signs, then the equation f (x) = 0 has a solution between a and b.
70                                                                Chapter 3 Proof Techniques

Proof: According to the Intermediate Value Theorem, f (x) can take on any value between
f (a) and f (b). Since they have opposite signs, 0 is a number between them. Hence, f (c) = 0
for some number c between a and b.

Example 3.1.5 The function f (x) = 5x3 - 2x - 1 is a polynomial function, which is known
to be continuous over the real numbers. Since f (0) = -1 and f (1) = 2, Corollary 3.1.3 implies
that there exists a number between 0 and 1 such that 5x3 - 2x - 1 = 0.

Hands-On Exercise 3.1.6 Show that the equation 1+x cos x = 0 has at least one real solution
between - and 0.

Hint: No function is mentioned here, so you need to define a function, say g(x). Next, you
need to make sure that g(x) is continuous. What else do you need to do before you can apply
Corollary 3.1.3?

Summary and Review

    · Sometimes we can prove a statement by showing how the result can be obtained through
       a construction, and we can describe the construction in an algorithm.

    · Sometimes all we need to do is apply an existence theorem to verify the existence of a
       certain quantity.

3.2 Direct Proofs

To show that a statement q is true, follow these steps:

   1. Either find a result that states p  q, or prove that p  q is true.
   2. Show or verify that p is true.
   3. Conclude that q must be true.

The logic is valid because if p  q is true and p is true, then q must be true. Symbolically, we
are saying that the logical formula

                                                   [(p  q)  p]  q

is a tautology (we can easily verify this with a truth table). Symbolically, we present the
argument as

                                                             pq
                                                             p
                                                        q
Such an argument is called modus ponens or the law of detachment.

Example 3.2.1 The argument

               b2 > 4ac  ax2 + bx + c = 0 has two real solutions.
               x2 - 5x + 6 satisfies b2 > 4ac.
          x2 - 5x + 6 = 0 has two real solutions.
is an example of modus ponens.

    It is clear that implications play an important role in mathematical proofs. If we have a
sequence of implications, we could join them "head to tail" to form another implication:

                                           pq
                                           qr
                                       pr

This is called the law of syllogism.

Example 3.2.2 The argument

               German shepherds are dogs.
               Dogs are mammals.
               Mammals are vertebrates.
          German shepherds are vertebrates.

is valid because of the law of syllogism.

    The big question is, how can we prove an implication? The most basic approach is the direct  Proving p  q via
proof :                                                                                          a direct proof.

   1. Assume p is true.
   2. Deduce from p that q is true.

The important thing to remember is: use the information derived from p to show that q is true.
This is how a typical direct proof may look:

Proof: Assume p is true. Then . . .

Because of p, we find . . .

                            . . . Therefore, q is true.
                     72                                                                     Chapter 3 Proof Techniques

                     Example 3.2.3 Prove that if an m × n chessboard can be fully covered by non-overlapping
                     dominoes, then mn must be even.

                     Solution: Assume the chessboard can be covered by non-overlapping dominoes, and let t be the
                     number of dominoes that cover the chessboard. Then the chessboard must contain 2t squares.
                     Hence mn = 2t, which means mn must be an even number.

                         Before we continue with more examples, we would like to introduce the formal definition of
                     even and odd integers.

                     Definition. An integer is even if it can be written as 2q for some integer q, and odd if it can

                     be written as 2q + 1 for some integer q.                                                                       

                         We do not have to use q to denote the integer that, when multiplied by 2, produces an even
                     integer. Any letter will work, provided that we mention it is an integer. For example, if n is an
                     even integer, then we can write n = 2t for some integer t. The notion of even integers can be
                     further generalized.

                     Definition. Let m be a nonzero integer. An integer is said to be a multiple of m if it can be

                     written as mq for some integer q.                                                                              

                         We are now ready to study more examples.

                     Example 3.2.4 Show that the square of an odd integer is odd.

                     Solution: Let n be an odd integer. Then n = 2t + 1 for some integer t, and
                                                    n2 = (2t + 1)2 = 4t2 + 4t + 1 = 2(2t2 + 2t) + 1,

                     where 2t2 + 2t is an integer. Hence, n2 is odd.

                     Hands-On Exercise 3.2.1 Let n be an integer. Show that if n is odd, then n3 is odd.

                     Example 3.2.5 Show that the product of two odd integers is odd.

Describe your goal.  Solution: Let x and y be two odd integers. We want to show that xy is odd. Since x and y
                     are odd, we can write x = 2s + 1 and y = 2t + 1. We find
Pay attention to
the details!                              xy = (2s + 1)(2t + 1) = 4st + 2s + 2t + 1 = 2(2st + s + t) + 1,

                     where 2st + s + t is an integer. Therefore, xy is odd.

                         In this proof, we need to use two different quantities s and t to describe x and y because

                     they need not be the same. If we write x = 2s + 1 and y = 2s + 1, we are in effect saying that

                     x = y. We have to stress that s and t are integers, because just saying x = 2s + 1 and y = 2t + 1

                     does  not  guarantee  x  and  y  are  odd.  For  instance,  the  even  number  4  can  be  written  as  2·  3  + 1,
                                                                                                                                 2

                     which is of the form 2s + 1. It is obvious that 4 is not odd. Even though we can write a number

                     in the form 2s + 1, it does not necessarily mean the number must be odd, unless we know with

                     certainty that s is an integer. This example illustrates the importance of paying attention to

                     the details in our writing.
3.2 Direct Proofs                                                                   73

Example 3.2.6 Show that if x3 - 7x2 + x - 7 = 0, then x = 7.

Solution: Assume x3 - 7x2 + x - 7 = 0. We want to show that we must have x = 7. Since
                        x3 - 7x2 + x - 7 = x2(x - 7) + (x - 7) = (x2 + 1)(x - 7),

if it is equal to zero, we need either x2 + 1 = 0, or x - 7 = 0. Since x2 + 1 can never be zero, we
must have x - 7 = 0; thus x = 7.
Hands-On Exercise 3.2.2 Show that if x3 + 6x2 + 12x + 8 = 0, then x = -2.

    The last example demonstrates a technique called proof by cases. There are two possibili-
ties, namely, either (i) x2 + 1 = 0, or (ii) x - 7 = 0. The final conclusion is drawn after we study

these two cases separately.

Example 3.2.7 Show that if an integer n is not divisible by 3, then n2 - 1 must be a multiple
of 3.

Remark. The letter n has been used to identify the integer of interest to us, and it appears

in the hypothesis of the implication that we want to prove. Nonetheless, many authors would

start their proofs with the familiar phrase "Let n be . . . ."                      

Solution: Let n be an integer that is not divisible by 3. When it is divided by 3, the remainder
is 1 or 2. Hence, n = 3q + 1 or n = 3q + 2 for some integer q. In both cases, we want to show
that n2 - 1 is a multiple of 3. We need to go through the two cases separately.

    · Case 1: If n = 3q + 1 for some integer q, then
                                             n2 - 1 = 9q2 + 6q = 3(3q2 + 2q),

       where 3q2 + 2q is an integer.
    · Case 2: If n = 3q + 2 for some integer q, then

                                       n2 - 1 = 9q2 + 12q + 3 = 3(3q2 + 4q + 1),

       where 3q2 + 4q + 1 is an integer.
In both cases, we have shown that n2 - 1 is a multiple 3.

Hands-On Exercise 3.2.3 Show that n3 + n is even for all n  N.

Hands-On Exercise 3.2.4 Show that n(n + 1)(2n + 1) is divisible by 6 for all n  N.
74  Chapter 3 Proof Techniques

Hint: One of the two integers n and n + 1 must be even, so we already know that the product
n(n + 1)(2n + 1) is a multiple of 2. Hence, it remains to show that it is also a multiple of 3.
Consider three cases: n = 3q, n = 3q + 1, or n = 3q + 2, where q is an integer.

    We close our discussion with two common fallacies (logical errors). The first one is the
fallacy of the inverse or the denial of the antecedent:

                                                             pq
                                                             p
                                                        q

This in effect proves the inverse p  q, which we know is not logically equivalent to the original
implication. Hence, this is an incorrect method for proving an implication.

Example 3.2.8 Is the following argument

               Dictionaries are valuable.
               This book is not a dictionary.
          This book is not valuable.
valid? Why?

    Another common mistake is known as the fallacy of the converse or the affirmation of
the consequence:

                                                             pq
                                                             q
                                                        p
This only proves the converse q  p. Since the converse is not logically equivalent to the original
implication, this is an incorrect way to prove an implication.

Example 3.2.9 Is this argument

               No medicine tastes good.
               This drink tastes bad.
          This must be medicine.
a valid argument? Why?

Summary and Review

    · To prove an implication p  q, start by assuming that p is true. Use the information from
       this assumption, together with any other known results, to show that q must also be true.

    · If necessary, you may break p into several cases p1, p2, . . . , and prove each implication
       pi  q (separately, one at a time) as indicated above.

    · Be sure to write the mathematical expressions clearly. Use different variables if the quan-
       tities involved may not be the same.

   6. Prove that if n is not a multiple of 3, then n2 is also not a multiple of 3.

       Hint: If n is not a multiple of 3, then n = 3q + 1 or n = 3q + 2 for some integer q.

   7. Use the facts that
              

         (i) 2 is irrational, and 
        (ii) if x is irrational, then x is also irrational,
       to prove that 8 2 is irrational.

   8. Recall that we can use a counterexample to disprove an implication. Show that the
       following claims are false:

        (a) If x and y are integers such that x2 > y2, then x > y.
        (b) If n is a positive integer, then n2 + n + 41 is prime.

   9. Explain why the following arguments are invalid:

        (a) Let n be an integer. If n2 is odd, then n is odd. Therefore, n must be odd.
        (b) Let n be an integer. If n is even, then n2 is also even. As an integer, n2 could be

              odd. Hence, n cannot be even. Therefore, n must be odd.

  10. Analyze the following reasoning:

        (a) Let S be a set of real numbers. If x is in S, then x2 is in S. But x is not in S, hence
              x2 is not in S.

        (b) Let S be a set of real numbers. If x is in S, then x2 is in S. Therefore, if x2 is in S,
              then x is in S.

                      Instead of proving p  q directly, it is sometimes easier to prove it indirectly. There are two

your goal.
                          The proof by contrapositive is based on the fact that an implication is equivalent to its
                      contrapositive. Therefore, instead of proving p  q, we may prove its contrapositive q  p.
                      Since it is an implication, we could use a direct proof:

                         1. Assume q is true (hence, assume q is false).
                         2. Show that p is true (that is, show that p is false).
                      The proof may proceed as follow:

                                         Proof: We want to prove the contrapositive of the stated result.
                                         Assume q is false, . . .

                                               ..
                                               .

                                         . . . Therefore p is false.

                      Example 3.3.1 Let n be an integer. Show that if n2 is even, then n is also even.

                      Solution: Proof by contrapositive: we want to prove that if n is odd, then n2 is odd. If n is
                      odd, then n = 2t + 1 for some integer t. Hence,

                                                             n2 = 4t2 + 4t + 1 = 2(2t2 + 2t) + 1

                      is odd. This completes the proof.

                      Example 3.3.2 Show that if n is a positive integer such that the sum of its positive divisors
                      is n + 1, then n is prime.

                      Solution: We shall prove the contrapositive of the given statement. We want to prove that if
                      n is composite, then the sum of its positive divisors is not n + 1. Let n be a composite number.
                      Then its divisors include 1, n, and at least one other positive divisor x different from 1 and n.
                      So the sum of its positive divisors is at least 1 + n + x. Since x is positive, we gather that

                                                                        1 + n + x > 1 + n.

                      We deduce that the sum of the divisors cannot be n + 1. Therefore, if the sum of the divisors
                      of n is precisely n + 1, then n must be prime.

                      Example 3.3.3 Let x be a real number. Prove that if x3 - 7x2 + x - 7 = 0, then x = 7.

                      Solution: Assume x = 7, then
                                            x3 - 7x2 + x - 7 = x2(x - 7) + (x - 7) = (x2 + 1)(x - 7) = 0.

                      Thus, if x3 - 7x2 + x - 7 = 0, then x = 7.

                      then either x = -5, or x = 7.
3.3 Indirect Proofs  77

Hands-On Exercise 3.3.2 Let x and y be two real numbers. Prove that if x = 0 and y = 0,
then xy = 0.

    Another indirect proof is the proof by contradiction. To prove that p  q, we proceed as       Proof by
follows:                                                                                          contradiction.

   1. Suppose p  q is false; that is, assume that p is true and q is false.                       Another form of proof
   2. Argue until we obtain a contradiction, which could be any result that we know is false.     by contradiction.

How does this prove that p  q? Assuming that the logic used in every step in the argument
is correct, yet we still end up with a contradiction, then the only possible flaw must come from
the supposition that p  q is false. Consequently, p  q must be true.

    This is what a typical proof by contradiction may look like:

                   Proof: Suppose p  q is false. Then p is true and q is false. Then
                   ...

                         ..
                         .

                   . . . , which is a contradiction. Therefore, p  q must be true.

    There is a more general form for proving a statement r, which needs not be an implication.
To prove the proposition r by contradiction, we follow these steps:

   1. Suppose r is false.
   2. Argue until we obtain a contradiction.

                   Proof: Suppose r is false. Then . . .

                         ..
                         .

                   . . . , which is a contradiction. Therefore, r must be true.

Example 3.3.4 Show that if x3 - 7x2 + x - 7 = 0, then x = 7.

Solution: Assume x3 - 7x2 + x - 7 = 0, we want to show that x = 7. Suppose x = 7, then
x - 7 = 0, and

                      0 = x3 - 7x2 + x - 7 = x2(x - 7) + (x - 7) = (x2 + 1)(x - 7)

would have implied that x2 + 1 = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, we must have x = 7.

Example 3.3.5 Show that if P is a point not on a line L, then there exists exactly one
perpendicular line from P onto L.

Solution: Suppose we can find more than one perpendicular line from P onto L. Pick any two
of them, and denote their intersections with L as Q and R. Then we have a triangle P QR,
where the angles P QR and P RQ are both 90. This implies that the sum of the interior angles
78                                                                     Chapter 3 Proof Techniques

of the triangle P QR exceeds 180, which is impossible. Hence, there is only one perpendicular
line from P onto L.

Example 3.3.6 Show that if x2 < 5, then |x| < 5.

Solution: Assume x2 < 5, we want to show that |x| <5. Suppose, to the contrary, we have
|x|     5. Then either x   5, or x  - 5. If x                      5,  then  x2   5.  If  x-  5, we again
                                                                               
have x2  5. In either case, we have a contradiction. Hence |x| < 5.

Hands-On Exercise 3.3.3 Prove that if x2  49, then |x|  7.

Example 3.3.7 Prove that the logical formula
                                                   [(p  q)  p]  q

is a tautology.

Solution: Suppose [(p  q)  p]  q is false for some statements p and q. Then we find
    · (p  q)  p is true, and
    · q is false.

For the conjunction (p  q)  p to be true, we need
    · p  q to be true, and
    · p to be true.

Having p true and q false would make p  q false. This directly contradicts what we have found.
Therefore, the logical formula [(p  q)  p]  q is always true, hence it is a tautology.

Example 3.3.8 Prove, by contradiction, that if x is rational and y is irrational, then x + y is
irrational.

Solution: Let x be a rational number and y an irrational number. We want to show that x + y
is irrational. Suppose, to the contrary, that x + y is rational. Then

                                                                   m
                                                       x+y =

                                                                   n

for some integers m and n, where n = 0. Since x is rational, we also have
                                                                 p

                                                          x=
                                                                 q

for some integers p and q, where q = 0. It follows that

                           m       p
                              = x + y = + y.

where mq - np and nq are both integers, with nq = 0. This makes y rational, which contradicts
the assumption that y is irrational. Thus, x + y cannot be rational, it must be irrational.

Example 3.3.9 Prove that 2 is irrational.

Solution:                                       
              Suppose, to the contrary, 2 is rational. Then we can write

                                                        m
                                                          2=
                                                                 n

for some positive integers m and n such that m and n do not share any common divisor except

1  (hence  m  is  in  its  simplest  term).  Squaring  both  sides  and  cross-multiplying  yields
           n

                                                 2n2 = m2.

Thus, m2 is a multiple of 2. Consequently, m must also be a multiple of 2. Then we can write
m = 2s for some integer s. The equation above becomes

                                              2n2 = m2 = (2s)2 = 4s2.

Hence,

                                                 n2 = 2s2,

which implies that n2 is a multiple of 2; thus, n is also a multiple of 2. We have proved that

both m and n are multiples of 2.This contradicts the assumption that m and n do not share
any common divisor. Therefore, 2 must be irrational.

                                                     
Hands-On Exercise 3.3.5 Prove that 3 is irrational.
80  Chapter 3 Proof Techniques

    Very often, a proof by contradiction can be rephrased into a proof by contrapositive or even
a direct proof, both of which are easier to follow. If this is the case, rewrite the proof.

Example 3.3.10 Show that x2 + 4x + 6 = 0 has no real solution. In symbols, show that
 x  R (x2 + 4x + 6 = 0).

Solution: Consider the following proof by contradiction:

          Suppose there exists a real number x such that x2 + 4x + 6 = 0. Using calculus,
          it can be shown that the function f (x) = x2 + 4x + 6 has a global minimum at
          x = -2. Thus, f (x)  f (-2) = 2 for any x. This contradicts the assumption
          that there exists an x such that x2 + 4x + 6 = 0. Thus, x2 + 4x + 6 = 0 has no
          real solution.

A close inspection reveals that we do not really need a proof by contradiction. The crux of the
proof is the fact that x2 + 4x + 6  2 for all x. This already shows that x2 + 4x + 6 could never
be zero. It is easier to use a direct proof, as follows.

          Using calculus, we find that the function f (x) = x2 + 4x + 6 has a global
          minimum at x = -2. Therefore, for any x, we always have f (x)  f (-2) = 2.
          Hence, there does not exist any x such that x2 + 4x + 6 = 0.

Do you agree that the second proof (the direct proof) is more elegant?

    Recall that a biconditional statement p  q consists of two implications p  q and q  p.
Hence, to prove p  q, we need to establish these two "directions" separately.

Example 3.3.11 Let n be an integer. Prove that n2 is even if and only if n is even.

Solution: () We first prove that if n2 is even, then n must be even. We shall prove its
contrapositive: if n is odd, then n2 is odd. If n is odd, then we can write n = 2t + 1 for some
integer t. Then

                                n2 = (2t + 1) = 4t2 + 4t + 1 = 2(2t2 + 2t) + 1,

where 2t2 + 2t is an integer. Thus, n2 is odd.

() Next, we prove that if n is even, then n2 is even. If n is even, we can write n = 2t for
some integer t. Then

                                             n2 = (2t)2 = 4t2 = 2 · 2t2,

where 2t2 is an integer. Hence, n2 is even, which completes the proof.

Summary and Review

    · We can use indirect proofs to prove an implication.
    · There are two kinds of indirect proofs: proof by contrapositive and proof by contradiction.
    · In a proof by contrapositive, we actually use a direct proof to prove the contrapositive of

       the original implication.
    · In a proof by contradiction, we start with the supposition that the implication is false,

       and use this assumption to derive a contradiction. This would prove that the implication
       must be true.
    · A proof by contradiction can also be used to prove a statement that is not of the form
       of an implication. We start with the supposition that the statement is false, and use this
       assumption to derive a contradiction. This would prove that the statement must be true.
    · Sometimes a proof by contradiction can be rewritten as a proof by contrapositive or even
       a direct proof. If this is true, rewrite the proof.

3.4 Mathematical Induction: An Introduction

Mathematical induction can be used to prove that an identity is valid for all integers n  1.
Here is a typical example of such an identity:

             1+2+3+···+n =          n(n + 1)             .

                                    2

More generally, we can use mathematical induction to prove that a propositional function P (n)
is true for all integers n  1.

Mathematical Induction. To show that a propositional function P (n) is true for all integers
n  1, follow these steps:

    1. Basis Step: Verify that P (1) is true.
    2. Inductive Step: Show that if P (k) is true for some integer k  1, then P (k + 1) is also

       true.

The basis step is also called the anchor step or the initial step. This proof technique is valid
because of the next theorem.

Theorem 3.4.1 (Principle of Mathematical Induction) If S  N such that

      (i) 1  S, and
      (ii) k  S  k + 1  S,

then S = N.

Remark. Here is a sketch of the proof. From (i), we know that 1  S. It then follows from

(ii) that 2  S. Applying (ii) again, we find that 3  S. Likewise, 4  S, then 5  S, and so on.

Since this argument can go on indefinitely, we find that S = N.
    There is a subtle problem with this argument. It is unclear why "and so on" will work. After

all, what does "and so on" or "continue in this manner" really mean? Can it really continue

indefinitely? The trouble is, we do not have a formal definition of the natural numbers. It turns

out that we cannot completely prove the principle of mathematical induction with just the usual

properties for addition and multiplication. Consequently, we will take the theorem as an axiom

without giving any formal proof.                                       

    Although we cannot provide a satisfactory proof of the principle of mathematical induction,
we can use it to justify the validity of the mathematical induction. Let S be the set of integers
n for which a propositional function P (n) is true. The basis step of mathematical induction
verifies that 1  S. The inductive step shows that k  S implies k + 1  S. Therefore, the
principle of mathematical induction proves that S = N. It follows that P (n) is true for all
integers n  1.

    The basis step and the inductive step, together, prove that

                                           P (1)  P (2)  P (3)  · · · .
3.4 Mathematical Induction: An Introduction                              83

Therefore, P (n) is true for all integers n  1. Compare induction to falling dominoes. When        Compare induction
the first domino falls, it knocks down the next domino. The second domino in turn knocks down      to the domino effect.
the third domino. Eventually, all the dominoes will be knocked down. But it will not happen
unless these conditions are met:

    · The first domino must fall to start the motion. If it does not fall, no chain reaction will
       occur. This is the basis step.

    · The distance between adjacent dominoes must be set up correctly. Otherwise, a certain
       domino may fall down without knocking over the next. Then the chain reaction will stop,
       and will never be completed. Maintaining the right inter-domino distance ensures that
       P (k)  P (k + 1) for each integer k  1.

To prove the implication

                          P (k)  P (k + 1)

in the inductive step, we need to carry out two steps: assuming that P (k) is true, then using it
to prove P (k + 1) is also true. So we can refine an induction proof into a 3-step procedure:

1. Verify that P (1) is true.
2. Assume that P (k) is true for some integer k  1.
3. Show that P (k + 1) is also true.

The second step, the assumption that P (k) is true, is sometimes referred to as the inductive
hypothesis or induction hypothesis. This is how a mathematical induction proof may look:

Proof: We proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the left-hand
side of the identity reduces to . . . , and the right-hand side becomes
. . . . Hence, the identity holds when n = 1. Assume the identity
holds when n = k for some integer k  1; that is, assume

                          ...                        (3.1)

for some integer k  1. We want to show that it also holds when
n = k + 1; that is, we want to show that

                          ... .

Using the inductive hypothesis (3.1), we find

                          ... .

Therefore, the identity also holds when n = k + 1. This completes
the induction.

    The idea behind mathematical induction is rather simple. However, it must be delivered
with precision.

(i) Be sure to say "Assume the identity holds for some integer k  1." Do not say "Assume
    it holds for all integers k  1." If we already know the result holds for all k  1, then
    there is no need to prove anything at all.

(ii) Be sure to specify the requirement k  1. This ensures that the chain reaction of the
     falling dominoes starts with the first one.

(iii) Do not say "let n = k" or "let n = k + 1." The point is, you are not assigning the value
      of k and k + 1 to n. Rather, you are assuming that the statement is true when n equals
      k, and using it to show that the statement also holds when n equals k + 1.

Example 3.4.1 Use mathematical induction to show that

                                                                 n(n + 1)
                                    1+2+3+···+n =

                                                                     2

for all integers n  1.

Discussion. In the basis step, it would be easier to check the two sides of the equation separately.
The inductive step is the key step in any induction proof, and the last part, the part that proves
P (k + 1) is true, is the most difficult part of the entire proof. In this regard, it is helpful to
write out exactly what the inductive hypothesis proclaims, and what we really want to prove.
In this problem, the inductive hypothesis claims that

                                    1+2+3+···+k =                k(k + 1)   .

                                                                      2

We want to prove that P (k + 1) is also true. What does P (k + 1) really mean? It says

                              1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (k + 1) =      (k + 1)(k + 2)   .

                                                                         2

Compare the left-hand sides of these two equations. The first one is the sum of k quantities,
and the second is the sum of k + 1 quantities, and the extra quantity is the last number k + 1.
The sum of the first k terms is precisely what we have on the left-hand side of the inductive
hypothesis. Hence, by writing

                        1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (k + 1) = 1 + 2 + · · · + k + (k + 1),

we can regroup the right-hand side as

                   1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (k + 1) = [1 + 2 + · · · + k] + (k + 1),

so that 1 + 2 + · · · + k can be replaced by 2 k(k+1) , according to the inductive hypothesis. With
additional algebraic manipulation, we try to show that the sum does equal to 2 (k+1)(k+2) . 

Solution: We proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the left-hand side of the identity reduces

to  1,  and  the  right-hand  side  becomes  1·2  =  1;  hence,  the  identity    holds  when  n  =  1.  Assume  it
                                              2

holds when n = k for some integer k  1; that is, assume that

                                                                k(k + 1)
                                    1+2+3+···+k =

                                                                     2

for some integer k  1. We want to show that it also holds when n = k + 1. In other words, we

want to show that                                                (k + 1)(k + 2)

                              1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (k + 1) =              2        .

Using the inductive hypothesis, we find

                  1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (k + 1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + k + (k + 1)

                                                     =   k(k + 1)     + (k + 1)

                                                         2

                                                                      k
                                                     = (k + 1) + 1

                                                                      2

                                                     = (k + 1) ·      k+2      .

                                                                         2

Therefore, the identity also holds when n = k + 1. This completes the induction.

    We can use the summation notation also called the sigma notation) to abbreviate a
sum. For example, the sum in the last example can be written as

                                                   n

                                                      i.

                                                  i=1

The letter i is the index of summation. By putting i = 1 under and n above, we declare
that the sum starts with i = 1, and ranges through i = 2, i = 3, and so on, until i = n. The
quantity that follows describes the pattern of the terms that we are adding in the summation.
Accordingly,

                                                            10

                                              i2 = 12 + 22 + 32 + · · · + 102.

                 i=1

In general, the sum of the first n terms in a sequence {a1, a2, a3, . . . } is denoted     i=1 n ai. Observe

that

                                 k+1              k

                                        ai =           ai + ak+1,

                                 i=1              i=1

which provides the link between P (k + 1) and P (k) in an induction proof.

Example 3.4.2 Use mathematical induction to show that, for all integers n  1,

      n n(n + 1)(2n + 1)
            i2 = 12 + 22 + 32 + · · · + n2 =                                      .
      i=1 6

Solution: We proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the left-hand side reduces to 12 = 1,

and the right-hand side becomes  1·2·3  = 1; hence, the identity holds when n = 1.         Assume it
                                   6

holds when n = k for some integer k  1; that is, assume that

                                  k k(k + 1)(2k + 1)
                                     i2 =

                                 i=1 6

for some integer k  1. We want to show that it still holds when n = k + 1. In other words, we
want to show that

      k+1 (k + 1)(k + 2)[2(k + 1) + 1] (k + 1)(k + 2)(2k + 3)
      i2 =                                                 =                            .
      i=1 6 6

From the inductive hypothesis, we find

            k+1                            k

                i2 =                          i2 + (k + 1)2

            i=1                            i=1

                                 = k(k + 1)(2k + 1) + (k + 1)2
                                                6

                                 =      1  (k  +  1)[k(2k  +  1)  +  6(k  +  1)]
                                        6

                                 =      1  (k  +  1)(2k2   +  7k  +  6)
                                        6

                                 =      1  (k  +  1)(k  +  2)(2k  +  3).
                                        6

Therefore, the identity also holds when n = k + 1. This completes the induction.

for all integers n  1.

Solution: Proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the left-hand side reduces to 3+(3+5) = 11,

and the right-hand side becomes  2·11     = 11;    hence, the identity holds when n = 1.     Assume it

                                       =    (k + 1)(5k + 6)       + 5k + 8

                                                       2

                                       =    1  (5k2   +   21k  +  22)

This completes the induction.

    All three steps in an induction proof must be completed; otherwise, the proof may not be
correct.

Example 3.4.4 Never attempt to prove P (k)  P (k + 1) by examples alone. Consider

       P (n) : n2 + n + 11 is prime.

In the inductive step, we want to prove that

       P (k)  P (k + 1) for any k  1.

The following table verifies that it is true for 1  k  8:

    n  12345678 9

    n2 + n + 11 13 17 23 31 41 53 67 83 101

Nonetheless, when n = 10, the integer n2 + n + 11 = 121 is composite. So P (9)  P (10). The
inductive step breaks down when k = 9.

Example 3.4.5 The basis step is equally important. Consider proving

                                   P (n) : 3n + 2 = 3q for some integer q

for all n  N. Assume P (k) is true for some integer k  1; that is, assume 3k + 2 = 3q for some
integer q. Then

                                3(k + 1) + 2 = 3k + 3 + 2 = 3 + 3q = 3(1 + q).

Therefore, 3(k + 1) + 2 can be written in the same form. This proves that P (k + 1) is also true.
Does it follow that P (n) is true for all integers n  1? We know that 3n + 2 cannot be written
as a multiple of 3. What is the problem?

Solution: The problem is: we need P (k) to be true for at least one value of k so as to start the
sequence of implications

                        P (1)  P (2), P (2)  P (3), P (3)  P (4), . . .

The induction fails because we have not established the basis step. In fact, P (1) is false. Since
the first domino does not fall, we cannot even start the chain reaction.

Remark. Thus far, we have learned how to use mathematical induction to prove identities.

In general, we can use mathematical induction to prove a statement about n. This statement

can take the form of an identity, an inequality, or simply a verbal statement about n. We shall

learn more about mathematical induction in the next two sections.

                     for all integers n  1.

                 3.5 More on Mathematical Induction

                 Besides identities, we can also use mathematical induction to prove a statement about a positive
                 integer n.

                 Example 3.5.1 Prove that n(n + 1)(2n + 1) is a multiple of 6 for all integers n  1.

See Hands-On     Remark. We have already seen how to prove this claim using a proof by cases, which is
Exercise 3.2.4.
                 actually an easier way to prove that n(n + 1)(2n + 1) is divisible by 6. Nonetheless, we shall

                 demonstrate below how to use induction to prove the claim.                           

                 Discussion. In the inductive hypothesis, it is clear that we are assuming k(k + 1)(2k + 1) is a
                 multiple of 6. In the inductive step, we want to prove that

                     (k + 1)(k + 2)[2(k + 1) + 1] = (k + 1)(k + 2)(2k + 3)

                 is also a multiple of 6. A multiple of 6 can be written as 6q for some integer q. Since we have
                 two multiples of 6, we need to write

                                                       k(k + 1)(2k + 1) = 6q

                 and
                                                             (k + 1)(k + 2)(2k + 3) = 6Q

                 to distinguish them. By using the lowercase and uppercase of the same letter, we indicate that

                 they are different values. Yet, because they come from the same letter, they both share some

                 common attribute, in this case, being the quotients when the respective values are divided by 6.

                     Now, in the inductive step, we need to make use of the equation k(k + 1)(2k + 1) = 6q from

                 the inductive hypothesis. This calls for connecting the product (k + 1)(k + 2)(2k + 3) to the

                 expression k(k + 1)(2k + 1). Since they share the common factor k + 1, what remains to do is

                 write (k + 2)(2k + 3) in terms of k(2k + 1).

                     We are asked to prove that n(n + 1)(2n + 1) is a multiple of 6. This is not an identity. There-

                 fore, do not say "assume/show that the identity holds when . . . ." Instead, say "assume/show

                 that the claim is true when . . . ."                                                 

                 Solution: Proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, we have n(n + 1)(2n + 1) = 1 · 2 · 3 = 6,
                 which is clearly a multiple of 6. Hence, the claim is true when n = 1. Assume the claim is true
                 when n = k for some integer k  1; that is, assume that we can write

                                                                 k(k + 1)(2k + 1) = 6q

                 for some integer q. We want to show that the claim is still true when n = k + 1; that is, we
                 want to show that

                                         (k + 1)(k + 2)[2(k + 1) + 1] = (k + 1)(k + 2)(2k + 3) = 6Q
3.5 More on Mathematical Induction                                                          91

for some integer Q. Using the inductive hypothesis, we find
                         (k + 1)(k + 2)(2k + 3) = (k + 1)(2k2 + 7k + 6)
                                                         = (k + 1)[(2k2 + k) + (6k + 6)]
                                                         = (k + 1)[k(2k + 1) + 6(k + 1)]
                                                         = k(k + 1)(2k + 1) + 6(k + 1)2
                                                         = 6q + 6(k + 1)2
                                                         = 6 [q + (k + 1)2],

where q + (k + 1)2 is clearly an integer. This completes the induction.

Hands-On Exercise 3.5.1 Prove that n2 + 3n + 2 is even for all integers n  1.

Induction can also be used to prove inequalities, which often require more work to finish.

Example 3.5.2 Prove that          1                   1  1
for all positive integers n.      1 + 4 + · · · + n2  2 - n

Draft. In the inductive hypothesis, we assume that the inequality holds when n = k for some
integer k  1. This means we assume

                                   k1 1
                                       i2  2 - k .

                                  i=1

In the inductive step, we want to show that it also holds when n = k + 1. In other words, we

want to prove that

                                  k+1 1 1
                                       i2  2 - k + 1 .

                                  i=1

In order to use the inductive hypothesis, we have to find a connection between these two

inequalities. Obviously, we have

                                  k+1 1       k1                1
                                       i2 =       i2     + (k + 1)2 .

                                  i=1        i=1
92                                                                      Chapter 3 Proof Techniques

Hence, it follows from the inductive hypothesis that

                           k+1 1       k1               1               1    1
                                i2 =       i2        + (k + 1)2  2 - k + (k + 1)2 .

                           i=1        i=1

The proof would be complete if we could show that

                                               1     1                  1
                                      2 - k + (k + 1)2  2 - k + 1 .

There is no guarantee that this idea will work, but this should be the first thing we try.
    After rearrangement, the inequality becomes

                                                  1     1            1
                                            k + 1 + (k + 1)2  k ,

which  is  equivalent  to    k+2      1k .  Cross-multiplication     yields
                           (k+1)2

                                               k(k + 2)  (k + 1)2.

Since

                       k(k + 2) = k2 + 2k, and (k + 1)2 = k2 + 2k + 1,

it is clear that what we want to prove is indeed true.                                      

Polish It Up! Next, we rearrange the argument to make it read more smoothly. Essentially all

we need is to run the argument backward. To improve the flow of the argument, we can prove

a separate result on the side before we return to the main argument.                        

Proof 1: Proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the left-hand side becomes 1, and so does
the right-hand side; thus, the inequality holds. Assume it holds when n = k for some integer
k  1:

                                                      k1 1
                                                         i2  2 - k .

                                                                           i=1

We want to show that it also holds when n = k + 1:

                                                  k+1 1 1
                                                       i2  2 - k + 1 .

                                                  i=1

    To finish the proof, we need to derive an inequality. Notice that

                           k(k + 2) = k2 + 2k < k2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)2.

Hence, after dividing both sides by k(k + 1)2, we obtain

                                                      k+2 1
                                                     (k + 1)2 < k .

This leads to

                           1                1        (k + 1) + 1 k + 2 1
                           k + 1 + (k + 1)2 = (k + 1)2 = (k + 1)2 < k ,

which is equivalent to

                                               1     1               1
                                            - k + (k + 1)2 < - k + 1 .                      (3.2)
3.5 More on Mathematical Induction                                                        93

    We now return to our original problem. It follows from the inductive hypothesis and (3.2)
that

                                k+1 1       k1             1
                                     i2 =       i2  + (k + 1)2

                                i=1        i=1

                                              1        1
                                    2 - k + (k + 1)2

                                   < 2-          1  .

                                              k+1

Therefore, the inequality still holds when n = k + 1, which completes the induction.

Remark. The key step in the proof is to establish (3.2), which can be done by means of

contradiction.                                                                            

Proof 2: Proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the left-hand side becomes 1, and so does
the right-hand side; thus, the inequality holds. Assume it holds when n = k for some integer
k  1:

                                                      k1 1
                                                         i2  2 - k .

                                                                           i=1

We want to show that it also holds when n = k + 1:

                                   k+1 1 1
                                        i2  2 - k + 1 .

                                   i=1

To finish the proof, we need the following inequality. We claim that

                                1          1           1
                                - k + (k + 1)2 < - k + 1 .                                (3.3)

Suppose, to the contrary, that

                                1          1           1
                                - k + (k + 1)2  - k + 1 .

Clear the denominators by multiplying k(k + 1)2 to both sides of the inequality. We find
                                            -(k + 1)2 + k  -k(k + 1),

or equivalently,

                                -k2 - k - 1  -k2 - k,

which is the same as saying -1  0. This contradiction proves that (3.3) must be true.
    We now return to our original problem. It follows from the inductive hypothesis and (3.3)

that

                                k+1 1       k1             1
                                     i2 =       i2  + (k + 1)2

                                i=1        i=1

                                              1        1
                                    2 - k + (k + 1)2

                                   < 2-          1  .

                                              k+1

Therefore, the inequality still holds when n = k + 1, which completes the induction.

Hands-On Exercise 3.5.2 Show that n < 2n for all integers n  1.

    We do not have to start with n = 1 in the basis step. We can start with any integer n0.

Generalization. To show that P (n) is true for all integers n  n0, follow these steps:

   1. Verify that P (n0) is true.
   2. Assume that P (k) is true for some integer k  n0.
   3. Show that P (k + 1) is also true.

The major difference is in the basis step: we need to verify that P (n0) is true. In addition, in
the inductive hypothesis, we need to stress that k  n0.

Example 3.5.3 Use mathematical induction to show that

                                        n

                                                  1 n+1
                                           4i = (4 - 1)
                                       i=0 3

for all integers n  0.

Solution: Proceed by induction on n. When n = 0, the left-hand side reduces to i=0 0 4i =

    =  1,  and  the  right-hand  side  becomes          - 1)  =  3  ·3  =  1.  Hence,  the  formula  holds  when

n = 0. Assume it holds when n = k for some integer k  0; that is, assume

                                                  1 k+1

Using the inductive hypothesis, we find

k+1                                      k      + 4k+1

    4i =                                    4i

     = 13 (4k+1 - 1) + 4k+1

     = 13 (4k+1 - 1 + 3 · 4k+1)

     = 13 (4 · 4k+1 - 1)

     = 13 (4k+2 - 1),

which is what we want to prove, thereby completing the induction.

for all integers n  2.
Solution: Proceed by induction on n. When n = 2, the inequality becomes 22  22, which is
obviously true. Assume it holds when n = k for some integer k  2:

                                                         kk  2k.
We want to show that it still holds when n = k + 1:

                                                  (k + 1)k+1  2k+1.

Since k  2, it follows from the inductive hypothesis that
                                  (k + 1)k+1  kk+1 = k · kk  2 · 2k = 2k+1.

Therefore, the inequality still holds when n = k + 1. This completes the induction.

3.6 Mathematical Induction: The Strong Form

You may have heard of Fibonacci numbers. hey occur frequently in mathematics and life
sciences. They have even been applied to study the stock market! Fibonacci numbers form a
sequence every term of which, except the first two, is the sum of the previous two numbers.
Mathematically, if we denote the nth Fibonacci number Fn, then

                           Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2.                                 (3.4)

This is called the recurrence relation for Fn.
    Some students have trouble using (3.4): we are not adding n - 1 and n - 2. The subscripts

only indicate the locations within the Fibonacci sequence. Hence, F1 means the first Fibonacci
number, F2 the second Fibonacci number, and so forth. Compare this to dropping ten numbers
into ten boxes, and each box is labeled with the numbers 1 through 10. Let us use ai to denote
the value in the ith box. When we say a7, we do not mean the number 7. Instead, we mean
the number stored in Box 7. Expressed in words, the recurrence relation (3.4) tells us that the
nth Fibonacci number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and the (n - 2)th Fibonacci numbers. This is
easy to remember: we add the last two Fibonacci numbers to get the next Fibonacci number.

    The recurrence relation implies that we need to start with two initial values. We often start
with F0 = 0 (image F0 as the zeroth Fibonacci number, the number stored in Box 0) and F1 = 1.
We combine the recurrence relation for Fn and its initial values together in one definition:

                 F0 = 0, F1 = 1, Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, for n  2.

We have to specify that the recurrence relation is valid only when n  2, because this is the
smallest value of n for which we can use the recurrence relation. What happens if you want to
find F1 using this formula? You will get F1 = F0 + F-1, but F-1 is undefined!

    The sum of the zeroth and the first Fibonacci numbers give us the second Fibonacci number:

                                             F2 = F1 + F0 = 1 + 0 = 1.
Continuing in this fashion, we find

                      F3 = F2 + F1 = 1 + 1 = 2,

                      F4 = F3 + F2 = 2 + 1 = 3,

                      F5 = F4 + F3 = 3 + 2 = 5,

                      F6 = F5 + F4 = 5 + 3 = 8,

                      ...                    ...  ...                   ...

Following this pattern, what are the values of F7 and F8?
98                                                      Chapter 3 Proof Techniques

    Fibonacci numbers enjoy many interesting properties, and there are numerous results con-
cerning Fibonacci numbers. As a starter, consider the property

                                     Fn < 2n, n  1.

How would we prove it by induction?

    Since we want to prove that the inequality holds for all n  1, we should check the case of

n = 1 in the basis step. When n = 1, we have F1 = 1 which is, of course, less than 21 = 2.

In the inductive hypothesis, we assume that the inequality holds when n = k for some integer

k  1; that is, we assume

                                     Fk < 2k

for some integer k  1. Next, we want to prove that the inequality still holds when n = k + 1.

So we need to prove that

                                     Fk+1 < 2k+1.

    To make use of the inductive hypothesis, we need to apply the recurrence relation of Fibonacci
numbers. It tells us that Fk+1 is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers; that is,

                                     Fk+1 = Fk + Fk-1.

The only thing we know from the inductive hypothesis is Fk < 2k. So, as it stands, it does not
tell us much about Fk+1.

    A remedy is to assume in the inductive hypothesis that the inequality also holds when
n = k - 1; that is, we also assume that

                                     Fk-1 < 2k-1.

Therefore, unlike all the problems we have seen thus far, the inductive step in this problem relies
on the last two n-values instead of just one. In terms of dominoes, imagine they are so heavy
that we need the combined weight of two dominoes to knock down the next. Then

    Fk+1 = Fk + Fk-1 < 2k + 2k-1 = 2k-1(2 + 1) < 2k-1 · 22 = 2k+1,

which will complete the induction. This modified induction is known as the strong form of
mathematical induction. In contrast, we call the ordinary mathematical induction the weak
form of induction.

    The proof still has a minor glitch! To be able to use the inductive hypothesis in the recurrence
relation

                                                  Fk+1 = Fk + Fk-1,

both subscripts k and k - 1 must be at least 1, because the statement claims that Fn < 2n for
all n  1. This means we need k  2. Consequently, in the basis step, we have to assume the
inequality holds for at least the first two values of n.

    In terms of the domino effect, the chain reaction of the falling dominoes starts at k = 2. We
have to make sure that the first two dominoes will fall, so that their combined weight will knock
down the third domino. Then the combined weight of the second and the third dominoes will
knock over the fourth domino. The chain reaction will carry on indefinitely.

    Symbolically, the ordinary mathematical induction relies on the implication P (k)  P (k+1).
Sometimes, P (k) alone is not enough to prove P (k + 1). In the case of proving Fn < 2n, we
actually use

                                          [P (k - 1)  P (k)]  P (k + 1).

We need to assume in the inductive hypothesis that the result is true when n = k - 1 and n = k.
    More generally, in the strong form of mathematical induction, we can use as many previous

cases as we like to prove P (k + 1).

Strong Form of Mathematical Induction. To show that P (n) is true for all n  n0, follow
these steps:
3.6 Mathematical Induction: The Strong Form                                       99

   1. Verify that P (n) is true for some small values of n  n0.                                        We could use more
   2. Assume that P (n) is true for n = n0, n0 + 1, . . . , k for some integer k  n.                   than one previous
   3. Show that P (k + 1) is also true.                                                                case, say, n = k,
                                                                                                       k - 1, k - 2, . . . , to
The idea behind the inductive step is to show that                                                     establish the next
                                                                                                       case n = k + 1.
                         [ P (n0)  P (n0 + 1)  · · ·  P (k - 1)  P (k) ]  P (k + 1).

We may not need to use all of P (n0), P (n0 + 1), . . . , P (k - 1), P (k). In fact, we may only need
the last few of them, for example, P (k -3), P (k -2), P (k -1) and P (k). The number of previous
cases required to establish P (k + 1) tells us how many initial cases we have to verify in the basis
step. We do not know how many we need until the inductive step. For this reason, it is wise to
start with a draft.

Example 3.6.1 Show that Fn < 2n for all n  1.

Remark. We have already worked on the draft in the discussion above. We know that we

need to verify the first two n-values in the basis step, and to assume that the inequality holds

for at least two cases.                                                           

Solution: Proceed by induction on n. When n = 1 and n = 2, we find

                         F1 = 1 < 2 = 21,
                         F2 = 1 < 4 = 22.

Therefore, the inequality holds when n = 1, 2. Assume it holds for n = 1, 2, . . . , k, where k  2.

In particular, we have

                         Fk < 2k, and Fk-1 < 2k-1,

where k  2. Then

Fk+1 = Fk + Fk-1 < 2k + 2k-1 = 2k-1(2 + 1) < 2k-1 · 22 = 2k+1.

Hence, the inequality still holds when n = k + 1, which completes the induction.

    Recurrence relation can be used to define a sequence. For example, if the sequence {an} n=1
is defined recursively by

                                           an = 3an-1 - 2 for n  2,
with a1 = 4, then

                                           a2 = 3a1 - 2 = 3 · 4 - 2 = 10,
                                          a3 = 3a2 - 2 = 3 · 10 - 2 = 28.

Identity involving such sequences can often be proved by means of induction.

Example 3.6.2 The sequence {bn} n=1 is defined as
                           b1 = 5, b2 = 13, bn = 5bn-1 - 6bn-2 for n  3.

Prove that bn = 2n + 3n for all n  1.

Solution: Proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the proposed formula for bn says b1 =
2 + 3 = 5, which agrees with the initial value b1 = 5. When n = 2, the proposed formula claims
b2 = 4 + 9 = 13, which again agrees with the definition b2 = 13. Assume the formula is valid for
n = 1, 2, . . . , k for some integer k  2. In particular, assume

                                bk = 2k + 3k, and bk-1 = 2k-1 + 3k-1.

We want to show that the formula still works when n = k + 1. In other words, we want to show
that

                                                 bk+1 = 2k+1 + 3k+1.

Using the recurrence relation and the inductive hypothesis, we find

                              bk+1 = 5bk - 6bk-1
                                      = 5(2k + 3k) - 6(2k-1 + 3k-1)
                                      = 5 · 2k + 5 · 3k - 6 · 2k-1 - 6 · 3k-1
                                      = 5 · 2k + 5 · 3k - 2 · 3 · 2k-1 - 2 · 3 · 3k-1
                                      = 5 · 2k + 5 · 3k - 3 · 2k - 2 · 3k
                                      = 2 · 2k + 3 · 3k
                                      = 2k+1 + 3k+1

which is what we want to establish. This completes the induction, and hence, the claim that
bn = 2n + 3n.

are called the coefficients of the linear combination.

Remark. We want to prove that any sufficiently large integer n can be written as a linear

combination of 4 and 9 with nonnegative coefficients. This problem is called the postage stamp

problem for the obvious reason: can we use only 4-cent and 9-cent stamps to obtain an n-cent

postage for all integers n  24? Not too surprisingly, it is also called the money changing

problem (imagine replacing stamps with coins).                                          

Remark. The spirit behind mathematical induction (both weak and strong forms) is making

use of what we know about a smaller size problem. In the weak form, we use the result from

n = k to establish the result for n = k + 1. In the strong form, we use some of the results from

n = k, k - 1, k - 2, . . . to establish the result for n = k + 1.                       

Discussion. Let us first look at the inductive step, in which we want to show that we can write

k + 1 as a linear combination of 4 and 9. The key step of any induction proof is to relate the

case of n = k + 1 to a problem with a smaller size (hence, with a smaller value in n).

Imagine you want to send a letter that requires a (k + 1)-cent postage, and you can use only

4-cent and 9-cent stamps. You could first put down a 4-cent stamp. Then you still need to come

up with the remaining postage of (k + 1) - 4 = k - 3 cents. If you could use 4-cent and 9-cent

stamps to make up the remaining (k - 3)-cent postage, the problem is solved. Therefore, in the

inductive hypothesis, we need to assume that it can be done when n = k - 3.

For the whole argument to work, k - 3 has to be within the range of the n-values that we

consider. So we need k - 3  24; that is, we want k  27. Consequently, we have to verify the

claim for n = 24, 25, 26, 27 in the basis step.                                         

Solution: Proceed by induction on n. We find

24 = 4 · 6 + 9 · 0,
25 = 4 · 4 + 9 · 1,
26 = 4 · 2 + 9 · 2,
27 = 4 · 0 + 9 · 3.

Hence, the claim is true when n = 24, 25, 26, 27. Assume it is true when n = 24, 25, . . . , k for
some integer k  27. In particular, since k - 3  24, this assumption assures that

k - 3 = 4x + 9y

for some nonnegative integers x and y. It follows that

                                              k + 1 = 4 + (k - 3)
                                                       = 4 + 4x + 9y
                                                       = 4(1 + x) + 9y,

where 1+x and y are nonnegative integers. This shows that the claim is still true when n = k+1,
thereby completing the induction.

Hands-On Exercise 3.6.2 Show that all integers n  2 can be expressed as 2x + 3y for some
nonnegative integers x and y.

Summary and Review

    · If, in the inductive step, we need to use more than one previous instance of the statement
       that we are proving, we may use the strong form of the induction.

    · In such an event, we have to modify the inductive hypothesis to include more cases in the
       assumption.

    · We also need to verify more cases in the basis step.
    · Finally, we need to rewrite the whole proof to make it coherent.

Sets

4.1 An Introduction to Sets

A set is a collection of objects. The objects in a set are called its elements or members. The
elements in a set can be any types of objects, including sets! The members of a set do not even
have to be of the same type. For example, although it may not have any meaningful application,
a set can consist of numbers and names.

    We usually use capital letters such as A, B, C, S, and T to represent sets, and denote
their generic elements by their corresponding lowercase letters a, b, c, s, and t, respectively. To
indicate that b is an element of the set B, we adopt the notation b  B, which means "b belongs
to B" or "b is an element of B." We also write B b, and say "B contains b (as an element)."

    We designate these notations for some special sets of numbers:

                           R = the set of real numbers,
                           Q = the set of rational numbers,
                           Z = the set of integers,
                           N = the set of natural numbers (positive integers).
All these are infinite sets, because they all contain infinitely many elements. In contrast, finite
sets contain finitely many elements.
    We can use the roster method to describe a set if it has only a small number of elements.
We list all its elements explicitly, as in

                  A = the set of natural numbers not exceeding 7 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.

For sets with more elements, show the first few entries to display a pattern, and use an ellipsis
to indicate "and so on." For example,

                                                    {1, 2, 3, . . . , 20}

represents the set of the first 20 positive integers. The repeating pattern can be extended
indefinitely, as in

                                          N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}
                                          Z = {. . . , -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}
There are three kinds of integers: positive, negative, and the signless integer zero. In regards to
parity, an integer is either even or odd. An integer is even if and only if it is divisible by two.
Therefore, the set of even integers can be described as {. . . , -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, . . .}.
    We can use a set-builder notation to describe a set. For example, the set of natural
numbers is defined as

                                                 N = {x  Z | x > 0}.
106                                                                          Chapter 4 Sets

Here, the vertical bar | is read as "such that" or "for which." Hence, the right-hand side of the
equation is pronounced as "the set of x belonging to the set of integers such that x > 0," or
simply "the set of integers x such that x > 0." In general, this descriptive method appears in
the format

                                           { membership | properties }.

The notation | means "such that" or "for which" only when it is used in the set notation. It may
mean something else in a different context. Therefore, do not write "let x be a real number |
x2 > 3" if you want to say " let x be a real number such that x2 > 3." It is considered improper
to use a mathematical notation as an abbreviation.

Example 4.1.1 Write these two sets

                                   {x  Z | x2  1} and {x  N | x2  1}
by listing their elements explicitly.

Solution: The first set has three elements, and equals {-1, 0, 1}. The second set is a singleton
set; it is equal to {1}.

Hands-On Exercise 4.1.1  Use the roster method to describe the sets {x  Z | x2  20} and
{x  N | x2  20}.

Hands-On Exercise 4.1.2 Use the roster method to describe the set
                              {x  N | x  20 and x = n2 for some integer n}.

    There is a slightly different format for the set-builder notation. Before the vertical bar, we
describe the form the elements assume, and after the vertical bar, we indicate from where we
are going to pick these elements:

                         { pattern | membership }.

Here the vertical bar | means "where." For example,
                                                      {x2 | x  Z}

is the set of x2 where x  Z. It represents the set of squares: {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . .}.

Example 4.1.2 The set

                                    {2n | n  Z}

describes the set of even numbers. We can also write the set as 2Z.

Hands-On Exercise 4.1.3 Describe the set {2n + 1 | n  Z} with the roster method.

Hands-On Exercise 4.1.4 Use the roster method to describe the set {3n | n  Z}.

    An interval is a set of real numbers, all of which lie between two real numbers. Should        The interval (a, b)
the endpoints be included or excluded depends on whether the interval is open, closed , or         includes decimal
half-open. We adopt the following interval notation to describe them:                              numbers.

                                            (a, b) = {x  R | a < x < b},                            is not a number,
                                            [a, b] = {x  R | a  x  b},                             neither is -
                                            [a, b) = {x  R | a  x < b},
                                            (a, b] = {x  R | a < x  b}.

It is understood that a must be less than or equal to b. Hence, the notation (5, 3) does not make
much sense. How about [3, 3]? Is it a legitimate notation?

    An interval contains not just integers, but all the numbers between the two endpoints. By
numbers, we mean whole numbers and decimal numbers. For instance, (1, 5) = {2, 3, 4} because
the interval (1, 5) also includes decimal numbers such at 1.276, 2, and .

    We can use ± in the interval notation:

                                            (a, ) = {x  R | a < x},
                                          (-, a) = {x  R | x < a}.

However, we cannot write (a, ] or [-, a), because ± are not numbers. It is nonsense to
say x   or -  x. For the same reason, we can write [a, ) and (-, a], but not [a, ]
or [-, a].

Example 4.1.3 Write the intervals (2, 3), [2, 3], and (2, 3] in the descriptive form.

Solution: According to the definition of an interval, we find

                                         (2, 3) = {x  R | 2 < x < 3},
                                          [2, 3] = {x  R | 2  x  3},
                                          (2, 3] = {x  R | 2 < x  3}.

What would you say about [2, 3)?

Example 4.1.4 Write these sets

                       {x  R | -2  x < 5} and {x  R | x2  1}

in the interval form.

Solution: The answers are [-2, 5) and [-1, 1], respectively. The membership of x affects the

answers. If we change the second set to {x  Z | x2  1}, the answer would have been {-1, 0, 1}.
Can you explain why {-1, 0, 1} = [-1, 1]?
                    108                                                                   Chapter 4 Sets

                    Example 4.1.5 Be sure you are using the right types of numbers. Compare these two sets
                                                                  S = {x  Z | x2  5},
                                                                  T = {x  R | x2  5}.

                    One consists of integers only, while the other contains real numbers. Thus, S = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2},
                    and T = - 5, 5 .

                    Hands-On Exercise 4.1.5 Which of the following sets
                                                   {x  Z | 1 < x < 7} and {x  R | 1 < x < 7}

                    can be represented by the interval notation (1, 7)? Explain.

                    Hands-On Exercise 4.1.6 Explain why [2, 7 ] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.

                        Let S be a set of numbers; we define
                                                                 S+ = {x  S | x > 0},
                                                                 S- = {x  S | x < 0},

                    In plain English, S+ is the subset of S containing only those elements that are positive, S-
                    contains only the negative elements of S, and S contains only the nonzero elements of S.

                    Example 4.1.6 It should be obvious that N = Z+.

                    Hands-On Exercise 4.1.8 What is the notation for the set of negative integers?

See Example 2.1.8.       Some mathematicians also adopt these notations:

                                                                     bS = {bx | x  S},
                                                               a + bS = {a + bx | x  S}.
4.1 An Introduction to Sets                                            109

Accordingly, we can write the set of even integers as 2Z, and the set of odd integers can be
represented by 1 + 2Z.

    An empty set is a set that does not contain any element. Both

                          {x  R | x > 0 and x < 0} and {x  R | x2 < 0}

are examples of empty sets. The second example illustrates a typical application of an empty
set. It provides a convenient way of declaring that a problem has no solution: we say that the
solution set is an empty set. We denote an empty set with the notation  or { }. For example,
can you explain why (3, 3) = ?

Hands-On Exercise 4.1.9 What does the notation [7, 7 ] mean? How would you describe the
sets (7, 7), (7, 7 ] and [7, 7)?

                                    {x  R | (x2 - 2)(x2 + 3)  0} = .

Solution: The answers are: true, true, false, and false, respectively.

Example 4.1.8 When we write 3, 4, 5, . . . , n, we are referring to a list of integers between 3
and n, inclusive. It is understood that n  3. Consequently, the set

                                                     {3, 4, 5, . . . , n}

is empty when n = 2.

    Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they contain the same collection of elements. More
rigorously, we define

                                          A = B  x (x  A  x  B).
Since the elements of a set can themselves be sets, exercise caution and use proper notation
when you compare the contents of two sets.

Example 4.1.9 Explain why 0, {1} = {0, 1}.

Solution: The set 0, {1} consists of two elements: the integer 0 and the set {1}. The set          A set may contain
{0, 1} also consists of two elements, both of them integers; namely, 0 and 1.                      another set as an
                                                                                                   element.
    You may find the following analogy helpful. Imagine a set being a box. You open a box
to look at its contents. The box itself can be compared to the curly braces { and }. What it
holds is exactly what we call the elements of the set it represents. The contents of the two sets

 0, {1} and {0, 1} are depicted in the boxes shown in Figure 4.1.
    When you open the first box, you find two items. One of them is the number 0; the other is

another box that contains the number 1. The second box also contains two items that are both
numbers. What you find in these two boxes is not the same. Hence, the sets they represent are
different.

Pay attention        Example 4.1.10 True or false: Z = {. . . , -3, -2, -1}, 0, {1, 2, 3, . . .} ?
to the details.
                     Solution: The set on the left is Z, and
|A| is nonnegative.                                         Z = {. . . , -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.

                     It is an infinite set. The set on the right consists of only three elements:
                       (i) the set {. . . , -3, -2, -1}, which is the set of negative integers,
                       (ii) the integer 0, and

                      (iii) the set {1, 2, 3, . . .}, which is the set of positive integers.
                     Hence, they are not equal. Notice that

                                                        Z = {. . . , -3, -2, -1}, {0}, {1, 2, 3, . . .}
                     either, because the set on the right is a set of three sets, while the set on the left is a set of
                     integers. One has three elements; the other has infinitely many elements.

                         To reduce confusion, instead of saying a set of sets, we could say a collection of sets or a
                     family of sets. For example,

                                                                  {1, 3, 5, . . . , }, {2, 4, 6, . . . }

                     is a family of two sets, one of which is the set of positive odd integers; the other is the set of
                     positive even integers.

                     Definition. A set is said to be finite if it has a finite number of elements. The number of

                     elements in a finite set A is called its cardinality , and is denoted by |A|. Hence, |A| is always

                     nonnegative. If A is an infinite set, some authors would write |A| = .  

                     Example 4.1.11  While it is trivial that |{1, 4, 7, 8}| = 4, and |{0, 1}| = 2, it may not be
                     obvious that                                 0, {1} = 2,

                     and                         {. . . , -3, -2, -1}, 0, {1, 2, 3, . . . } | = 3.
4.1 An Introduction to Sets                                                  111

What matters is the number of entries in a set, which can be compared to how many items you           || is an integer.
can find when you open a box. Here is another example:

                                                |{x  R | x2 = 9}| = 2
because the equation x2 = 9 has two real solutions. What is |{x  N | x2 = 9}|?

Hands-On Exercise 4.1.11 Determine these cardinalities:
  (a) |{x  Z | x2 - 7x - 6 = 0}|
  (b) |{x  R | x2 - x - 12 < 0}|
  (c) |{x  Z | x is prime and x is even}|
Recall that your answers should be nonnegative.

Hands-On Exercise 4.1.12 Explain why it is incorrect to say || = . In fact, it is nonsense
to say || = . Explain. What should be the value of ||?

    We close this section with an important remark about sets. It follows from the definition
of equality of sets that we do not count repeated elements as separate elements. For example,
suppose a small student club has three officers:

                             chair:       Mary,
                             vice chair:  John,
                             secretary:   John;

and let A represent the set of its officers, and B the set of positions in its executive board, then
|A| = 2 and |B| = 3, because

                                                  A = {Mary, John},

and
                                        B = {chair, vice chair, secretary}.

Example 4.1.12 Find the errors in the following statement:

                   |{-2, 2}| = { | - 2|, |2|} = {2} = 2,

and correct them.

Solution: This statement contains several errors. The first mistake is assuming that we can
distribute the "absolute value" symbols | | over the contents of a set:

                                               |{-2, 2}| = { | - 2|, |2|}.

After all, the two vertical bars do not mean absolute value in this case. Instead, it means the
cardinality of the set {-2, 2}. Hence, |{-2, 2}| = 2.

    The second equality { | - 2|, |2|} = {2} is correct. After taking absolute values, both entries
become 2. However, we do not write {| - 2|, |2|} = {2, 2}, because a set should not contain
repetition. Therefore, it is correct to say { | - 2|, |2|} = {2}.
112                                               Chapter 4 Sets

    The last equality {2} = 2 is wrong. We cannot compare a set to a number. Imagine the set
{2} as a box containing only one object, and that object is the number 2. In contrast, 2 on the
right-hand side is left in the open air without any containment. It is clear that {2} = 2.

    The entire statement contains multiple mistakes; some of them are syntactical errors while
some are conceptual. Nevertheless, we do have |{-2, 2}| = 2. Although the final answer is
correct, the argument used to obtain it is not.

    In some situations, we do want to count repeated elements as separate elements, as in
S = {1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4}. We call such a collection a multiset instead of an ordinary set. In this
case, |S| = 8.

Summary and Review

    · A set is a collection of objects (without repetitions).
    · To describe a set, either list all its elements explicitly, or use a descriptive method.
    · Intervals are sets of real numbers.
    · The elements in a set can be any type of object, including sets.
    · We can even have a set containing dissimilar elements. In particular, we can mix elements

       and sets inside a set.
    · If a set A is finite, its cardinality |A| is the number of elements it contains. Consequently,

       |A| is always nonnegative.

4.2 Subsets and Power Sets

We usually consider sets containing elements of similar types. The collection of all the objects
under consideration is called the universal set, and is denoted U. For example, for numbers,
the universal set is R.

     Figure 4.2: The relationship among various sets of geometric figures.

    The pictorial representation in Figure 4.2 is called a Venn diagram. We use a rectangle
to represent the universal set, and circles or ovals to represent the sets inside the universal set.
The relative positions of these circles and ovals indicate the relationship of the respective sets.
For example, having R, S, and L inside P means that rhombuses, squares, and rectangles are
parallelograms. In contrast, circles are incomparable to parallelograms.

    A set A is a subset of another set B, denoted by A  B, if every element of A is also an
element of B. See Figure 4.3. We also call B a superset of A, and write B  A, which is
similar to y  x.

                                   Figure 4.3: The Venn diagram for A  B.

Example 4.2.2 It is clear that N  Z and Z  R. We can nest these two relationships into
one, and write N  Z  R. More generally, we have

                                                    N  Z  Q  R.
Compare this to x  y  z  w. We shall discover many similarities between  and .
4.2 Subsets and Power Sets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          115

Example 4.2.3 It is obvious that

                                              {1, 2, 7}  {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}

because all three elements 1, 2, and 7 from the set on the left also appear as elements in the set
on the right. Meanwhile,

                                              {1, 2, 7} {1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9}

because 7 belongs to the first set but not the second.

Example 4.2.4 The following statements are true:
  (a) {1, 2, 3}  N.
  (b) {x  R | x2 = 1}  Z.
Be sure you can explain clearly why these subset relationships hold.

Hands-On Exercise 4.2.1 Are these statements true or false?
  (a) {-1, 2} N, and {-1, 2}  Z.
  (b) {x  Z | x2  1}  R.

Example 4.2.5 Do not assume that if A B then we must have B  A. For instance, if
A = {1, 5, 7} and B = {3, 8}, then A B; but we also have B A.

    The last example demonstrates that A B is more complicated than just changing the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The definition of
subset notation like we do with inequalities. We need a more precise definition of the subset                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A  B.
relationship:

                                                                                                                             A  B  x  U (x  A  x  B).

It follows that

                                                                                                                             A B  x  U (x  A  x  B).

Hence, to show that A is not a subset of B, we need to find an element x that belongs to A but
not B. There are three possibilities; their Venn diagrams are depicted in Figure 4.4.

                 116                                                                          Chapter 4 Sets

                      With the notion of universal set, we can now refine the definition for set equality:

                                           A = B  x  U (x  A  x  B).

                 Logically, x  A  x  B is equivalent to

                                           (x  A  x  B)  (x  B  x  A).

                 Therefore, we can also define the equality of sets via subset relationship:

                                           A = B  (A  B)  (B  A),

                 which can be compared to

                                           x = y  (x  y)  (y  x)

                 for real numbers x and y.
                     This new definition of set equality suggests that in order to prove that A = B, we could use

                 this two-step argument:

A way to prove   1. Show that A  B.
A = B.           2. Show that B  A.

Compare this to  This technique is useful when it is impossible or impractical to list the elements of A and B for
(x  y)  (y  z)   comparison. This is particularly true when A and B are defined abstractly. We will apply this
 x  z.           technique in the coming sections.

                     The two relationship  and  share many common properties. The transitive property is
                 another example.

                 Theorem 4.2.1 Let A, B, and C be sets. If A  B and B  C, then A  C.

                 Discussion. The theorem statement is in the form of an implication. To prove p  q, we start
                 with the assumption p, and use it to show that q must also be true. In this case, these two steps
                 become

                   (i) Assume that A  B and B  C.
                   (ii) Show that A  C.

                 How can we prove that A  C? We know that A  C means

                                           x  U (x  A  x  C).

                 So we have to start with x  A, and attempt to show that x  C as well. How can we show

                 that x  C? We need to use the assumption A  B and B  C.                                    

                 Proof: Assume A  B and B  C, we want to show that A  C. In this regards, let x  A,
                 we want to show that x  C as well. Since A  B, we also have x  B. Likewise, B  C implies
                 that x  C. Since every element x in A is also an element of C, we conclude that A  C.

                     The proof relies on the definition of the subset relationship. Many proofs in mathematics
                 are rather simple if you know the underlying definitions.

                 Example 4.2.7 Prove that x  A  {x}  A, for any element x  U.

                 Discussion. We call p  q a biconditional statement because it consists of two implications
                 p  q and p  q. Hence, we need to prove it in two steps:

                    1. Show that p  q.
                    2. Show that q  p.
4.2 Subsets and Power Sets                                                                                                                                                                                        117

We call these two implications the necessity and sufficiency of the biconditional statement,
and denote them () and (), respectively. In this problem,

    · () means "x  A  {x}  A".
    · () means "{x}  A  x  A".

This is how the proof may look:

() Assume x  A.                                                           . . . Therefore, {x}  A.
() Assume {x}  A.                                                            . . . Therefore, x  A.

We now proceed to finish the proof.                                                                                                                                                                               

Solution: () Assume x  A. The set {x} contains only one element x, which is also an
element of A. Thus, every element of {x} is also an element of A. By definition, {x}  A.

() Assume {x}  A. The definition of the subset relationship asserts that every element of
{x} is also an element of A. In particular, x is an element of {x}, so it is also an element of A.
Thus, x  A.

Definition. The set A is a proper subset of B, denoted A B or A  B, if A is a subset of
B, and A = B. Symbolically, A  B  (A  B)  (A = B). Equivalently,

A  B  (A  B)  x  U (x  B  x  A).

                         Proof: Since every element of A also appears in A, it follows immediately that A  A. To

                                                       xxA

An implication is        for any arbitrary x  U. Since  is empty, x   is always false; hence, the implication is always

                         Solution: (a) By definition, an empty set contains no element. Consequently, the statement
                            is false.

                         (b) A subset relation only exists between two sets. To the left of the symbol , we have only a
                         number, which is not a set. Hence, the statement is false. In fact, this expression is syntactically
                         incorrect.

                         (c) The set {} contains one element, which happens to be an empty set. Compare this to an
                         empty box inside another box. The outer box is described by the pair of set brackets { . . . },
                         and the (empty) box inside is . It follows that   {} is a true statement.

                         Example 4.2.10  Let A = {1, 2} and B = {1}. The subsets of A are , {1}, {2} and {1, 2}.
                         Therefore,                        (A) = , {1}, {2}, {1, 2} .

                         In a similar manner, we find

with only one element). Then the doubleton subsets, and so forth. Complete the following table.

                            0
                            1 {1}, {2}, . . .
                            2 {1, 2}, {1, 3}, . . .
                            3 {1, 2, 3}, . . .
                            4 ...

Since A  A for any set A, the power set (A) always contains A itself. As a result, the last
subset in the list should be A itself.

    We are now ready to put them together to form the power set. All you need is to put all the
subsets inside a pair of bigger curly braces (a power set is itself a set; hence, it needs a pair of
curly braces in its description). Put your final answer in the space below.

Check to make sure that the left and right braces match perfectly.

Example 4.2.11 Since A is a subset of A, it belongs to (A). Nonetheless, it is improper to
say A  (A). Can you explain why? What should be the correct notation?

Solution: The power set (A) is the collection of all the subsets of A. Thus, the elements in
(A) are subsets of A. One of these subsets is the set A itself. Hence, A itself appears as an
element in (A), and we write A  (A) to describe this membership.

    This is different from saying that A  (A). In order to have the subset relationship
A  (A), every element in A must also appear as an element in (A). The elements of (A)
are sets (they are subsets of A, and subsets are sets). An element of A is not the same as a
subset of A. Therefore, although A  (A) is syntactically correct, its truth value is false.

Hands-On Exercise 4.2.6 Explain the difference between  and {}. How many elements are
there in  and {}? Is it true that () = {}?

Theorem 4.2.3 If A is an n-element set, then (A) has 2n elements. In other words, an
n-element set has 2n distinct subsets.

Proof: How many subsets of A can we construct? To form a subset, we go through each of

the n elements and ask ourselves if we want to include this particular element or not. Since
there are two choices (yes or no) for each of the n elements in A, we have found 2 · 2 · · · · 2 = 2n

                            n times

Explain.

Example 4.2.12 When a set contains sets as elements, its power set could become rather
complicated. Here are two examples.

                            ( {a}, {1} ) = , {a} , {1} , {a}, {1} ,

                                ( , {1} ) = , {}, {1} , , {1} .

Be sure you understand the notations used in these examples. In particular, examine the number
of levels of set brackets used in each example.

Summary and Review

    · A set S is a subset of another set T if and only if every element in S can be found in T .
    · In symbols, S  T  x  U (x  S  x  T ).
    · Consequently, to show that S  T , we have to start with an arbitrary element x in S, and

       show that x also belongs to T .
    · The definition of subset relationship implies that for any set S, we always have   S and

       S  S.
    · The power set of a set S, denoted (S), contains all the subsets of S.
    · If |S| = n, then |(S)| = 2n. Hence, an n-element set has 2n subsets.
    · To construct (S), list the subsets of S according to their sizes. Be sure to use a pair of

       curly braces for each subset, and enclose all of them within a pair of outer curly braces.

x  A - B means x      Definition. The set difference A - B, sometimes written as A \ B, is defined as
belongs to A but not
to B.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A - B = {x  U | x  A  x  B}.

x  A means x does     In words, A - B contains elements that can only be found in A but not in B. Operationally
not belong to A.
                      speaking, A - B is the set obtained from A by removing the elements that also belong to B.

                      Therefore, the set difference A - B is also called the relative complement of B in A. In

                      particular, U - A is called the complement of A, and is denoted by A, A or Ac.

                      Remark. We would like to remind the readers that it is not uncommon among authors to

                      adopt different notations for the same mathematical concept. Likewise, the same notation could

                      mean something different in another textbook or even another branch of mathematics. It is

                      important to develop the habit of examining the context and making sure that you understand

                      the meaning of the notations when you start reading a mathematical exposition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

                      Example 4.3.1 Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, A = {1, 2, 3}, and B = {3, 4}. Find A  B, A  B,
                      A - B, B - A, A, and B.

                      Solution: We have

                                                                     A  B = {3},
                                                                     A  B = {1, 2, 3, 4},

                                                                     B - A = {4}.

                      We also find A = {4, 5}, and B = {1, 2, 5}.

                      Find A  B, A  B, A - B, B - A, A, and B.

4.3 Unions and Intersections  123

Example 4.3.2 The set of integers can be written as the

                                   Z = {-1, -2, -3, . . .}  {0}  {1, 2, 3, . . .}.
Can we replace {0} with 0? Explain.

Hands-On Exercise 4.3.3 Explain why the following expressions are syntactically incorrect.
  (a) Z = {-1, -2, -3, . . .}  0  {1, 2, 3, . . .}.
  (b) Z = . . . , -3, -2, -1  0  1, 2, 3, . . .
  (c) Z = . . . , -3, -2, -1 + 0 + 1, 2, 3, . . .
  (d) Z = Z-  0  Z+
How would you fix the errors in these expressions?

Example 4.3.3 For any set A, what are A  , A  , A - ,  - A and A?
Solution: It is clear that

                             A   = , A   = A, and A -  = A.
From the definition of set difference, we find  - A = . Finally, A = A.
Example 4.3.4 Write, in interval notation, [5, 8)  (6, 9] and [5, 8)  (6, 9].
Solution: The answers are

                          [5, 8)  (6, 9] = [5, 9], and [5, 8)  (6, 9] = (6, 8).
They are obtained by comparing the location of the two intervals on the real number line.
Hands-On Exercise 4.3.4 Write, in interval notation, (0, 3)  [-1, 2) and (0, 3)  [-1, 2).

Example 4.3.5 We are now able to describe the following set
                                             {x  R | (x < 5)  (x > 7)}

in the interval notation. It can be written as either (-, 5)  (7, ) or, using complement,
R - [5, 7 ]. Consequently, saying x / [5, 7 ] is the same as saying x  (-, 5)  (7, ), or
equivalently, x  R - [5, 7 ].
124  Chapter 4 Sets

Theorem 4.3.1 The following properties hold for any sets A, B, and C in a universal set U.

   1. Commutative properties: A  B = B  A,
                                                A  B = B  A.

   2. Associative properties: (A  B)  C = A  (B  C),
                                             (A  B)  C = A  (B  C).

   3. Distributive laws: A  (B  C) = (A  B)  (A  C),
                                     A  (B  C) = (A  B)  (A  C).

   4. Idempotent laws: A  A = A,
                                    A  A = A.

   5. De Morgan's laws: A  B = A  B,
                                      A  B = A  B.

   6. Laws of the excluded middle, or inverse laws: A  A = U,
                                                                               A  A = .

    As an illustration, we shall prove the distributive law

                                        A  (B  C) = (A  B)  (A  C).

We want to show that

                            x  U x  A  (B  C)  x  (A  B)  (A  C) .

We shall prove this in two different ways.
    In the first proof, we need to show that

        A  (B  C)  (A  B)  (A  C), and (A  B)  (A  C)  A  (B  C),

which will be established in two separate steps.

Proof 1: Let x  A  (B  C). Then x  A, or x  B  C. We know that x  B  C implies
that x  B and x  C. So we have

  (i) x  A or x  B, and
  (ii) x  A or x  C;

equivalently,

  (i) x  A  B, and
  (ii) x  A  C.

Thus, x  (A  B)  (A  C). We have proved that A  (B  C)  (A  B)  (A  C).
    Now let x  (A  B)  (A  C). Then x  A  B and x  A  C. From the definition of

union, we find

  (i) x  A or x  B, and
  (ii) x  A or x  C.

Both conditions require x  A, so we can rewrite them as

  (i) x  A, or
  (ii) x  B and x  C;

equivalently,
4.3 Unions and Intersections                                                         125

  (i) x  A, or
  (ii) x  B  C.

Thus, x  A  (B  C). This proves that (A  B)  (A  C)  A  (B  C). Together with
A  (B  C)  (A  B)  (A  C), we conclude that A  (B  C) = (A  B)  (A  C).

    What follows is an alternate proof. This type of argument is shorter, but is more symbolic;
hence, it is more difficult to follow. Consequently, it is a good idea to include the explanation
at the end of each step. We often adopt the format shown below.

Proof 2: Since                                              (defn. of union)
                                                            (defn. of intersection)
         x  A  (B  C)  x  A  x  (B  C)                      (distributive law)
                                x  A  (x  B  x  C)          (defn. of union)
                                (x  A  x  B)  (x  A  x  C)  (defn. of intersection)
                                (x  A  B)  (x  A  C)
                                x  (A  B)  (A  C)

it follows that A  (B  C) = (A  B)  (A  C).

Discussion. Let us start with a draft. The statement we want to prove takes the form of

How can you use the first two pieces of information to obtain what we need to establish?

Now it is time to put everything together, and polish it into a final version. Remember three
things:

 (iii) the introduction and the conclusion.

Summary and Review

    · Memorize the definitions of intersection, union, and set difference. We rely on them to
       prove or derive new results.

    · The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted A  B, is the set of elements common to
       both A and B. In symbols, x  U x  A  B  (x  A  x  B) .

    · The union of two sets A and B, denoted A  B, is the set that combines all the elements
       in A and B. In symbols, x  U x  A  B  (x  A  x  B) .

    · The set difference between two sets A and B, denoted by A - B, is the set of elements
       that can only be found in A but not in B. In symbol, it means x  U x  A - B  (x 

       A  x / B) .

                               C = {x | x is married},
                               D = {x | x is over 21 years old},

      (b) (A  B) = (A)  (B)
      (c) (A - B) = (A) - (B)

     Remark. To show that two sets U and V are equal, we usually want to prove that
     x  U  x  V . In this problem, the element x is actually a set. Since we usually use
     uppercase letters to denote sets, we should start the proof of (a) with "Let S  (A  B)."
     If you prefer to use the alternate approach, it looks like the following:

                         S  (A  B)  . . .

                                               ...
                                               ..
                                               .

                                               S  (A)  (B).

     These remarks also apply to (b) and (c).                                     

4.4 Cartesian Products

Another way to obtain a new set from two given sets A and B is to form ordered pairs. An
ordered pair (x, y) consists of two values x and y. Their order of appearance is important, so
we call them first and second elements respectively. Consequently, (a, b) = (b, a) unless a = b.
In general, (a, b) = (c, d) if and only if a = c and b = d.
4.4 Cartesian Products                                                                 129

Definition. The Cartesian product of A and B is the set                                                       Enclose ordered pairs
                                                                                                              in parentheses. Write
                            A × B = {(a, b) | a  A  b  B}.                                                    them as (x, y), and
                                                                                                              not as {x, y}.

Thus, A × B (read as "A cross B") contains all the ordered pairs in which the first elements are

selected from A, and the second elements are selected from B.                          

Example 4.4.1 Let A = {John, Jim, Dave} and B = {Mary, Lucy}. Determine A × B and
B × A.

Solution: We find
 A × B = {(John, Mary), (John, Lucy), (Jim, Mary), (Jim, Lucy), (Dave, Mary), (Dave, Lucy)},
 B × A = {(Mary, John), (Mary, Jim), (Mary, Dave), (Lucy, John), (Lucy, Jim), (Lucy, Dave)}.

In general, A × B = B × A.

Example 4.4.2 Determine A × B and A × A:
 (a) A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 5, 6}.
 (b) A = {5} and B = {0, 7}.

Solution: (a) We find
                            A × B = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6)},
                            A × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}.

(b) The answers are A × B = {(5, 0), (5, 7)}, and A × A = {(5, 5)}.

Example 4.4.3 Determine ({1, 2}) × {3, 7}. Be sure to use correct notation.

Solution: For a complicated problem, divide it into smaller tasks and solve each one separately.              Divide and conquer!
Then assemble them to form the final answer. In this problem, we first evaluate

                            ({1, 2}) = , {1}, {2}, {1, 2} .

This leads to

({1, 2}) × {3, 7} =         , {1}, {2}, {1, 2} × {3, 7}
                         =  (, 3), (, 7), ({1}, 3), ({1}, 7), ({2}, 3), ({2}, 7), ({1, 2}, 3), ({1, 2}, 7) .

Check to make sure that we have matching left and right parentheses, and matching left and
right curly braces.

                     Hands-On Exercise 4.4.2 Find {a, b, c} × ({d}).

                     Example 4.4.4 How could we describe the contents of the Cartesian product [1, 3] × {2, 4}?
                     Since [1, 3] is an infinite set, it is impossible to list all the ordered pairs. We need to use the
                     set-builder notation:

                                                      [1, 3] × {2, 4} = {(x, y) | 1  x  3, y = 2, 4}.

                     We can also write [1, 3] × {2, 4} = {(x, 2), (x, 4) | 1  x  3}.

                     Hands-On Exercise 4.4.3 Describe, using the set-builder notation, the Cartesian product
                     [1, 3] × [2, 4].

                         Cartesian products can be extended to more than two sets. Instead of ordered pairs, we need
                     ordered n-tuples. The n-fold Cartesian product of n sets A1, A2, . . . , An is the set

                                     A1 × A2 × · · · × An = {(a1, a2, . . . , an) | ai  Ai for each i, 1  i  n}.
                     In particular, when Ai = A for all i, we abbreviate the Cartesian product as An.

                     Example 4.4.5 The n-dimensional space is denoted Rn. It is the n-fold Cartesian product of
                     R. In special cases, R2 is the xy-plane, and R3 is the xyz-space.

                     Hands-On Exercise 4.4.4 Let A = {1, 2}, B = {a, b}, and C = {r, s, t}. Find A × B × C.

(A × B) × C,         Example 4.4.6 From a technical standpoint, (A × B) × C is different from A × B × C. Can
A × (B × C) and      you explain why? Can you discuss the difference, if any, between (A × B) × C and A × (B × C)?
A × B × C are three  For instance, give some specific examples of the elements in (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) to
different sets.      illustrate their differences.

                     Solution: The elements of (A × B) × C are ordered pairs in which the first coordinates are
                     themselves ordered pairs. A typical element in (A × B) × C takes the form of

                                                                              (a, b), c .

                     The elements in A × B × C are ordered triples of the form

                                                                              (a, b, c).
4.4 Cartesian Products                                       131

Since their elements look different, it is clear that (A × B) × C = A × B × C. Likewise, a typical
element in A × (B × C) looks like

                                                         a, (b, c) .

Therefore, (A × B) × C = A × (B × C), and A × (B × C) = A × B × C.

Theorem 4.4.1 For any sets A, B, and C, we have

Remark.                       A × (B  C) = (A × B)  (A × C),
                              A × (B  C) = (A × B)  (A × C),
                              A × (B - C) = (A × B) - (A × C).
         How would we show that the two sets S and T are equal? We need to show that

                        x  S  x  T.

The complication in this problem is that both S and T are Cartesian products, so x takes on
a special form, namely, that of an ordered pair. Consider the first identity as an example; we
need to show that

         (u, v)  A × (B  C)  (u, v)  (A × B)  (A × C).

We prove this in two steps: first showing , then , which is equivalent to first showing ,

then . Alternatively, we can use  throughout the argument.                                 

Proof 1: Let (u, v)  A × (B  C). Then u  A, and v  B  C. The definition of union
implies that v  B or v  C. Thus far, we have found

  (i) u  A and v  B, or
  (ii) u  A and v  C.

This is equivalent to

  (i) (u, v)  A × B, or
  (ii) (u, v)  A × C.

Thus, (u, v)  (A × B)  (A × C). This proves that A × (B  C)  (A × B)  (A × C).

    Next, let (u, v)  (A × B)  (A × C). Then (u, v)  A × B, or (u, v)  A × C. This means

  (i) u  A and v  B, or
  (ii) u  A and v  C.

Both conditions require u  A, so we can rewrite them as

  (i) u  A, and
  (ii) v  B or v  C;

which is equivalent to

  (i) u  A, and
  (ii) v  B  C.

Thus, (u, v)  A×(B C). We have proved that (A×B)(A×C)  A×(B C). Together with
A × (B  C)  (A × B)  (A × C) that we have proved earlier, we conclude that A × (B  C) =
(A × B)  (A × C).

                               (u, v)  (A × B)  (A × C)      (defn. of union)

we conclude that A × (B  C) = (A × B)  (A × C).

Theorem 4.4.2 If A and B are finite sets, with |A| = m and |B| = n, then |A × B| = mn.

Proof: The elements of A × B are ordered pairs of the form (a, b), where a  A, and b  B.
There are m choices of a. For each fixed a, we can form the ordered pair (a, b) in n ways, because
there are n choices for b. Together, the ordered pairs (a, b) can be formed in mn ways.

    The argument we used in the proof is called multiplication principle. We shall study it
again in Chapter 8. In brief, it says that if a job can be completed in several steps, then the
number of ways to finish the job is the product of the number of ways to finish each step.

Corollary 4.4.3 If A1, A2, . . . , An are finite sets, then |A1 ×A2 ×· · ·×An| = |A1|·|A2| · · · |An|.

Corollary 4.4.4 If A is a finite set with |A| = n, then |(A)| = 2n.

Proof: Let the elements of A be a1, a2, . . . , an. The elements of (A) are subsets of A. Each
subset of A contains some elements from A. Associate to each subset S of A an ordered n-tuple
 b1, b2, . . . , bn from {0, 1}n such that

                                                 bi = 0 if ai / S,
                                                          1 if ai  S.

The value of the ith element in this ordered n-tuple indicates whether the subset S contains the
element ai. It is clear that the subsets of A are in one-to-one correspondence with the n-tuples.
This means the power set (A) and the Cartesian product {0, 1}n have the same cardinality.
Since there are 2n ordered n-tuples, we conclude that there are 2n subsets as well.

    This idea of one-to-one correspondence is a very important concept in mathematics. We
shall study it again in Chapter 6.

Summary and Review

    · The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted A × B, consists of ordered pairs of
       the form (a, b), where a comes from A, and b comes from B.

    · Since ordered pairs are involved, A × B usually is not equal to B × A.
    · The notion of ordered pairs can be extended analogously to ordered n-tuples, thereby

       yielding an n-fold Cartesian product.
    · If A and B are finite sets, then |A × B| = |A| · |B|.

4.5 Index Sets

The notion of union can be extended to three sets:

                A  B  C = {x  U | (x  A)  (x  B)  (x  C)}.

It is obvious how to generalize it to the union of any number of sets. We use a notation that
resembles the summation notation to describe such a union:

                                                                n

                                                Ai = A1  A2  · · ·  An.

                                                               i=1

We define

                 n

                    Ai = {x  U | (x  A1)  (x  A2)  · · ·  (x  An)}.

                i=1

It looks messy! Here is a better alternative:

                                        n

                               Ai = {x  U | x  Ai for some i, where 1  i  n}.

                                      i=1

In a similar manner, i=1 n Ai = A1  A2  · · ·  An, and we define

                                          n

                                 Ai = {x  U | x  Ai for all i, where 1  i  n}.

                                         i=1

In plain English, i=1 n Ai is the collection of all elements in the Ai's, and i=1 n Ai is the collection
of all elements common to all Ai's.

Example 4.5.1 For i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , let Ai = [-i, i]. First, construct several Ai for comparison,
because it may help us detect any specific pattern. See Figure 4.6. It is clear that A1  A2  · · · .
Thus, i=1 n Ai = [-n, n] = An, and i=1 n Ai = [-1, 1] = A1.

                         In some situations, we may borrow the idea of partial sums from calculus. We first find the
                         union or intersection of the first n sets, then take the limit as n approaches infinity. Thus, if the
                         limit is well-defined, then

                                                               n                                  n

                                                     Ai = lim Ai, and             Ai = lim Ai.

                         Recall that we write (-, ) instead of [-, ] because ± are not numbers, they are merely

Theorem 4.5.2 If A1  A2  A3  · · ·, then i=1  Ai = A1.
    How could we describe the union A2  A4  A6  · · · ? Well, we can write

                                                                Ai,

                                                                       i even

which means that union of Ai, where i is even. Since the set of even positive integers is denoted
by 2N, another way to describe the same union is

                                          Ai.

                                     i2N

It means the union all Ai, where i is taken out from the set 2N. Accordingly,

                                               

                           Ai = Ai, and                 Ai = Ai.

                      i=0  iN                  i=0      iN

We can even go one step further, by allowing i to be taken from any set of integers, or any set
of real numbers, or even any set of objects. The only restriction is that Ai must exist, and its
content must somehow depend on i.

    In general, given a nonempty set I, if we could associate with each i  I a set Ai, we define
the indexed family of sets A as

                                     A = {Ai | i  I}.

We call I the index set, and define

                                        Ai = {x | x  Ai for some i  I},

                                                   iI

                                        Ai = {x | x  Ai for all i  I}.

                                                   iI

Let us look at a few examples.

Example 4.5.5 To describe the union

                                             A1  A3  A7  A11  A23,

we first define the index set to be I = {1, 3, 7, 11, 23}, which is the set of all the subscripts used
in the union. Now the union can be conveniently described as iI Ai.

Example 4.5.6 Consider five sets

                                     A1 = {1, 4, 23},
                                     A2 = {7, 11, 23},
                                     A3 = {3, 6, 9},
                                     A4 = {5, 17, 22},
                                     A5 = {3, 6, 23}.

Let I = {2, 5}, then

Likewise,              Ai = A2  A5 = {7, 11, 23}  {3, 6, 23} = {3, 6, 7, 11, 23}.

                      iI

           iI Ai = A2  A5 = {7, 11, 23}  {3, 6, 23} = {23}.

Hands-On Exercise 4.5.6 Let J = {1, 4, 5}. Evaluate iJ Ai and iJ Ai, where Ais are
defined in the last example.

Hands-On Exercise 4.5.7 An index set could be a set of any objects. For instance, the sets
of numbers in the last example could be the favorite Lotto numbers of five different students.
We could index these sets according to the names of the students:

                                               AJohn = {1, 4, 23},
                                               AMary = {7, 11, 23},

                                                 AJoe = {3, 6, 9},
                                                APete = {5, 17, 22},
                                               ALucy = {3, 6, 23}.

If I = {Mary, Joe, Lucy}, what is iI Ai? How would you interpret its physical meaning?

Example 4.5.7 Let I = {x | x is a living human being }, and define

                     Bi = {x  I | x is a child of i},
                     Ai = {i}  Bi

for each i  I. Then

                         Ai = ,      Ai = I,      Bi = ,

                     iI          iI           iI

and
                                  Bi = I - {x | x's parents are both deceased }.

                                           iI

We leave it as an exercise to verify these unions and intersections.

of student i, interpret the meaning of iI Ai and iI Ai.

    We close this section with yet another generalization of De Morgan's laws.
Theorem 4.5.3 (Extended De Morgan's Laws) For any nonempty index set I, we have

                           Ai = Ai,  and                  Ai = Ai.

                       iI    iI                       iI  iI

Proof 1: Let x  iI Ai, then

                       x / Ai = {x | x  Ai for some i  I}.

                              iI

This means x / Ai for every i  I. Hence, x  Ai for each i  I. Consequently,

                                     x  Ai.

                                            iI

This proves that  iI Ai  iI Ai.
    Next, let x   iI Ai. Then x  Ai for each i  I. This means x / Ai for each i  I. Then

                       x / {x | x  Ai for some i  I} = Ai.

                                                                                       iI

Thus, x  iI Ai, proving that iI Ai  iI Ai. We proved earlier that iI Ai  iI Ai.
Therefore, the two sets must be equal.

    The proof of iI Ai = iI Ai proceeds in a similar manner, and is left as an exercise.

Proof 2: We shall prove iI Ai = iI Ai. We leave out the explanations for you to fill in:

                           x  Ai  x  Ai

                             iI           iI

                                      x  Ai for some i

                                      x / Ai for all i

                                      x  Ai for all i

                                      x  Ai.

                                                     iI

The proof of  iI Ai =  iI Ai is left as an exercise.

Summary and Review

    · When dealing with arbitrary intersection or union of intervals, first identify the endpoints,
       then analyze the sets involved in the operation to determine whether an endpoint should

       be included or excluded.
    · Intersection and union can be performed on a group of similar sets identified by subscripts

       belonging to an index set.
    · Consequently, intersection or union can be formed by naming a specific index set.

Basic Number Theory

5.1 The Principle of Well-Ordering

Number theory studies the properties of integers. Some basic results in number theory rely on
the existence of a certain number. The next theorem can be used to show that such a number
exists.

Theorem 5.1.1 (Principle of Well-Ordering) Every nonempty subset S of Z+ = N has a
smallest element.

    The idea is rather simple. Start with the integer 1. If it belongs to S, we are done. If not,
consider the next integer 2, and then 3, and so on, until we find the first element in S. However,
like the principle of mathematical induction, it is unclear why "and so on" is possible. In fact,
we cannot prove the principle of well-ordering with just the familiar properties that the natural
numbers satisfy under addition and multiplication. Hence, we shall regard the principle of well-
ordering as an axiom. Interestingly though, it turns out that the principle of mathematical
induction and the principle of well-ordering are logically equivalent.

Theorem 5.1.2 The principle of mathematical induction holds if and only if the principle of
well-ordering holds.

Proof: () Suppose S is a nonempty set of natural numbers that has no smallest element.
Let

                                      R = {x  N | x  s for every s  S}.
Since S does not have a smallest element, it is clear that R  S = . It is also obvious that
1  R. Assume k  R. Then any natural number less than or equal to k must also be less than
or equal to s for every s  S. Hence 1, 2, . . . , k  R. Because R  S = , we find 1, 2, . . . , k / S.
If k + 1  S, then k + 1 would have been the smallest element of S. This contradiction shows
that k + 1  R. Therefore, the principle of mathematical induction would have implied that
R = N. That would make S an empty set, which contradicts the assumption that S is nonempty.
Therefore, any nonempty set of natural numbers must have a smallest element.
() Let S be a set of natural numbers such that

  (i) 1  S,
  (ii) For any k  1, if k  S, then k + 1  S.

Suppose S = N. Then S = N - S = . The principle of well-ordering states that S has a
smallest element z. Since 1  S, we deduce that z  2, which makes z - 1  1. The minimality
of z implies that z - 1 / S. Hence, z - 1  S. Condition (ii) implies that z  S, which is a
contradiction. Therefore, S = N.
                      142                                                              Chapter 5 Basic Number Theory

                          The principle of well-ordering is an existence theorem. It does not tell us which element is
                      the smallest integer, nor does it tell us how to find the smallest element.

                      Example 5.1.1 Consider the sets

                                                  A = {n  N | n is a multiple of 3},
                                                  B = {n  N | n = -11 + 7m for some m  Z},
                                                  C = {n  N | n = x2 - 8x + 12 for some x  Z}.

                      It is easy to check that all three sets are nonempty, and since they contain only positive integers,
                      the principle of well-ordering guarantees that each of them has a smallest element.

                          These smallest elements may not be easy to find. It is obvious that the smallest element in A
                      is 3. To find the smallest element in B, we need -11 + 7m > 0, which means m > 11/7  1.57.
                      Since m has to be an integer, we need m  2. Since -11 + 7m is an increasing function in m,
                      its smallest value occurs when m = 2. The smallest element in B is -11 + 7 · 2 = 3.

                          To determine the smallest element in C, we need to solve the inequality x2 - 8x + 12 > 0.
                      Factorization leads to x2 - 8x + 12 = (x - 2)(x - 6) > 0, so we need x < 2 or x > 6. Because
                      x  Z, we determine that the minimum value of x2 - 8x + 12 occurs at x = 1 or x = 7. Since

                                                             12 - 8 · 1 + 12 = 72 - 8 · 7 + 12 = 5,

                      The smallest element in C is 5.

                      Example 5.1.2 The principle of well-ordering may not be true over real numbers or negative
                      integers. In general, not every set of integers or real numbers must have a smallest element.
                      Here are two examples:

Two sets that do not       · The set Z.
have a smallest            · The open interval (0, 1).
element.

                      The set Z has no smallest element because given any integer x, it is clear that x - 1 < x, and

                      this argument can be repeated indefinitely. Hence, Z does not have a smallest element.
                           A similar problem occurs in the open interval (0, 1). If x lies between 0 and 1, then so is x2 ,
                           x
                      and  2  lies  between  0  and  x,  such  that

                                                                                      x
                                                         0 < x < 1  0 < < x < 1.

                                                                                      2

                      This process can be repeated indefinitely, yielding

                                                               x         x xx
                                                     0 < · · · < 2n < · · · < 23 < 22 < 2 < x < 1.

                      We keep getting smaller and smaller numbers. All of them are positive and less than 1. There
                      is no end in sight, hence the interval (0, 1) does not have a smallest element.

                      Remark. In the last example, we can also use contradiction to prove that the open interval
                      (0, 1) does not have a smallest element. Suppose, to the contrary, the interval (0, 1) has a
                      smallest element x. Then 0 < x < 1. But we also have

                                                                          x
                                                                     0 < < x < 1.

                                                                           2

                      The  number   x  is  also  inside  the   interval  (0, 1),  but  is  smaller  than  x.  This contradicts the
                                    2

                      assumption that x is the smallest element in the interval (0, 1). This contradiction proves that

                      the interval (0, 1) does not have a smallest element.                                   

                          The idea behind the principle of well-ordering can be extended to cover numbers other than
                      positive integers.
5.1 The Principle of Well-Ordering  143

Definition. A set T of real numbers is said to be well-ordered if every nonempty subset of

T has a smallest element.           

    Therefore, according to the principle of well-ordering, N is well-ordered.                    A proof by
                                                                                                  contradiction.
Example 5.1.3 Show that Q is not well-ordered.

Solution: Suppose x is the smallest element in Q. Then x - 1 is a rational number that is
smaller than x, which contradicts the minimality of x. This shows that Q does not have a
smallest element. Therefore Q is not well-ordered.

Hands-On Exercise 5.1.1 Show that the interval [0, 1] is not well-ordered by finding a subset
that does not have a smallest element.

Summary and Review

    · A set of real numbers (which could be decimal numbers) is said to be well-ordered if every
       nonempty subset in it has a smallest element.

    · A well-ordered set must be nonempty and have a smallest element.
    · Having a smallest element does not guarantee that a set of real numbers is well-ordered.
    · A well-ordered set can be finite or infinite, but a finite set is always well-ordered.

                       5.2 Division Algorithm

                       When we divide a positive integer (the dividend) by another positive integer (the divisor), we
                       obtain a quotient. We multiply the quotient to the divisor, and subtract the product from
                       the dividend to obtain the remainder. Such a division produces two results: a quotient and a
                       remainder.

                           This is how we normally divide 23 by 4:

                                                                          5
                                                                  4 ) 23

                                                                        20
                                                                          3

                       In general, the division b ÷ a takes the form

                                                                         q
                                                                  a) b

                                                                        aq
                                                                         r

                       so that r = b - aq, or equivalently, b = aq + r. Of course, both q and r are integers. Yet, the
                       following "divisions"

                                    4                          2              6          7

                                  16                           8             24         28

                       also satisfy the requirement b = aq + r, but that is not what we normally do. This means having
                       b = aq + r alone is not enough to define what quotient and remainder are. We need a more rigid
                       definition.

                       Theorem 5.2.1 (Division Algorithm) Given any integers a and b, where a > 0, there exist
                       integers q and r such that

                                                                              b = aq + r,

                       where 0  r < a. Furthermore, q and r are uniquely determined by a and b.

                           The integers b, a, q, and r are called the dividend , divisor , quotient, and remainder ,
                       respectively. Notice that b is a multiple of a if and only if r = 0.

                           The division algorithm describes what happens in long division. Strictly speaking, it is not
                       an algorithm. An algorithm describes a procedure for solving a problem. The theorem does not
                       tell us how to find the quotient and the remainder. Some mathematicians prefer to call it the
                       division theorem. Here, we follow the tradition and call it the division algorithm.

                       Remark. This is the outline of the proof:

                       1. Describe how to find the integers q and r such that b = aq + r.
                       2. Show that our choice of r satisfies 0  r < a.
                       3. Establish the uniqueness of q and r.

                       Regarding the last part of the proof: to show that a certain number x is uniquely determined,

                       a typical approach is to assume that x is another choice that satisfies the given condition, and

                       show that we must have x = x .                                       

Step 1: Show that      Proof: We first show the existence of q and r. Let

there exist q, r  Z                                          S = {b - ax | x  Z and b - ax  0}.
such that b = aq + r.  Clearly, S is a set of nonnegative integers. To be able to apply the principle of well-ordering,
                       we need to show that S is nonempty. Here is a constructive proof.
5.2 Division Algorithm                                                   145

· Case 1. If b  0, we can set x = 0. Then b - ax = b  0.
· Case 2. If b < 0, set x = b. Since a  1, we have 1 - a  0. Then

                                         b - ax = b - ab = b(1 - a)  0.

Since S is nonempty, it follows from the principle of well-ordering that S has a smallest element.  Step 2: Show that r
Call it r. From the definition of S, there exists some integer q such that b - aq = r.              satisfies the criterion
                                                                                                    0  r < a.
    Next, we show that 0  r < a. The definition of S tells us immediately that r  0, so we
only need to show that r < a. Suppose, on the contrary, r  a. Then r = a + t for some integer       Step 3: Establish the
t  0. Now b - aq = r = a + t implies that                                                           uniqueness of q and r.

                                        0  t = b - aq - a = b - a(q + 1).

So t  S. Now t = r - a < r suggests that we have found another element in S which is even
smaller than r. This contradicts the minimality of r. Therefore r < a.

    Finally, we have to establish the uniqueness of both q and r. Let q and r be integers such
that

                                            b = aq + r , 0  r < a.

From aq + r = b = aq + r , we find a(q - q ) = r - r. Hence

                                                  a |q - q | = |r - r|.

Since |r - r| is an integer, if |r - r| = 0, we would have a  |r - r|. From 0  r, r < a, we
deduce that |r - r| < a, which clearly contradicts our observation that a  |r - r|. Hence,
|r - r| = 0. Then r = r. It follows that q = q. So the quotient q and the remainder r are
unique.

    You should not have any problem dividing a positive integer by another positive integer.
This is the kind of long division that we normally perform. It is more challenging to divide a
negative integer by a positive integer. When b is negative, the quotient q will be negative as
well, but the remainder r must be nonnegative. In a way, r is the deciding factor: we choose q
such that the remainder r satisfies the condition 0  r < a.

    In general, for any integer b, dividing b by a produces a decimal number. If the result is not
an integer, round it down to the next smaller integer (see Example 6.1.3). It is the quotient q
that we want, and the remainder r is obtained from the subtraction r = b - aq. For example,

                                                 -22
                                                        = -3.1428 . . . .

                                                    7

Rounding it down produces the quotient q = -4, and the remainder is r = -22 - 7(-4) = 6;
and we do have -22 = 7 · (-4) + 6.

Hands-On Exercise 5.2.1 Compute the quotients q and the remainders r when b is divided
by a:

(a) b = 128, a = 7      (b) b = -128, a = 7  (c) b = -389, a = 16

Be sure to verify that b = aq + r.

The division algorithm can be generalized to any nonzero integer a.

                       Corollary 5.2.2 Given any integers a and b with a = 0, there exist uniquely determined integers
                       q and r such that b = aq + r, where 0  r < |a|.

                       Proof: We only have to consider the case of a < 0. Since -a > 0, the original Euclidean
                       Algorithm assures that there exist uniquely determined integers q and r such that

                                                                          b = (-a) · q + r,

                       where 0  r < -a = |a|. Therefore, we can set q = -q .

                       Example 5.2.1 Not every calculator or computer program computes q and r the way we want

                       them done in mathematics. The safest solution is to compute |b| ÷ |a| in the usual way, inspect
                       the remainder to see if it fits the criterion 0  r < |a|. If necessary, adjust the value of q so that
                       the remainder r satisfies the requirement 0  r < |a|. Here are some examples:

Remember: what                                  b a b = aq + r                 qr
really matters is the
choice of r; it must                            14 4 14 = 4 · 3 + 2            32
satisfy 0  r < |a|.
                            -14 4 -14 = 4 · (-4) + 2                           -4 2

                            -17 -3 -17 = (-3) · 6 + 1                          61

                                                17 -3 17 = (-3) · (-5) + 2 -5 2

                       The quotient q can be positive or negative, and the remainder r is always nonnegative.

                       Definition. Given integers a and b, with a = 0, let q and r denote the unique integers such
                       that b = aq + r, where 0  r < |a|. Define the binary operators div and mod as follows:

                                                            b div a = q,
                                                           b mod a = r.

                       Therefore, b div a gives the quotient, and b mod a yields the remainder of the integer division

                       b ÷ a. Recall that b div a can be positive, negative, or even zero. But b mod a is always a

                       nonnegative integer less than |a|.                                                      

                       Example 5.2.2 From the last example, we have

                         (a) 14 div 4 = 3, and 14 mod 4 = 2.
                         (b) (-14) div 4 = -4, and (-14) mod 4 = 2.
                         (c) (-17) div (-3) = 6, and (-17) mod (-3) = 1.
                         (d) 17 div (-3) = -5, and 17 mod (-3) = 2.

                       Do not forget to check the computations, and remember that a need not be positive.

                                                b          a b div a b mod a

                                                  334 15
                                                  334 -15

                                                -334 -15

                       Do not forget: b mod a is always nonnegative.

                       Example 5.2.3 Let n be an integer such that
                                                            n div 6 = q, and n mod 6 = 4.

Solution: The given information implies that n = 6q + 4. Then
                             2n + 5 = 2(6q + 4) + 5 = 12q + 13 = 6(2q + 2) + 1.

Therefore, (2n + 5) div 6 = 2q + 2, and (2n + 5) mod 6 = 1.

Compute the values of (6n - 4) div 11 and (6n - 4) mod 11.

Example 5.2.4 Suppose today is Wednesday. Which day of the week is it a year from now?

Solution: Denote Sunday, Monday, . . . , Saturday as Day 0, 1, . . . 6, respectively. Today is
Day 3. A year (assuming 365 days in a year) from today will be Day 368. Since

                                                    368 = 7 · 52 + 4,
it will be Day 4 of the week. Therefore, a year from today will be Thursday.

Hands-On Exercise 5.2.4 Suppose today is Friday. Which day of the week is it 1000 days
from today?

Any integer divided by 7 will produce a remainder between 0 and 6, inclusive. Define

         Ai = {x  Z | x mod 7 = i} for 0  i  6,

we find

         Z = A0  A1  A2  A3  A4  A5  A6,

where the sets Ai are pairwise disjoint. The collection of sets

                        {A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6}

is called a partition of Z, because every integer belongs to one and only one of these seven
subsets. We also say that Z is a disjoint union of A0, A1, . . . , A6. The same argument also
applies to the division by any integer n  2.

    In general, a collection or family of finite sets {S1, S2, . . . , Sn} is called a partition of the set
S if S is the disjoint union of S1, S2, . . . Sn. Partition is a very important concept, because it
divides the elements of S into n classes S1, S2, . . . , Sn such that every element of S belongs to
a unique class. We shall revisit partition again when we study relations in Chapter 7.

Summary and Review

    · The division of integers can be extended to negative integers.
    · Given any integer b, and any nonzero integer a, there exist uniquely determined integers

       q and r such that b = aq + r, where 0  r < |a|.
    · We call q the quotient, and r the remainder.
    · The reason we have unique choices for q and r is the criterion we place on r. It has to

       satisfy the requirement 0  r < |a|.
    · In fact, the criterion 0  r < |a| is the single most important deciding factor in our choice

       of q and r.
    · We define two binary operations on integers. The div operation yields the quotient, and

       the mod operation produces the remainder, of the integer division b ÷ a. In other words,

       b div a = q, and b mod a = r.

5.3 Divisibility

In this section, we shall study the concept of divisibility. Let a and b be two integers such that
a = 0. The following statements are equivalent:

    · a divides b,
    · a is a divisor of b,
    · a is a factor of b,
    · b is a multiple of a, and
    · b is divisible by a.

They all mean

                         There exists an integer q such that b = aq.                                                     Memorize this
                                                                                                                         definition!
In terms of division, we say that a divides b if and only if the remainder is zero when b is divided
by a. We adopt the notation                                                                                              Write a | b, not a/b
                                                                                                                         or a\b.

Do not use a forward slash / or a backward slash \ in the notation. To say that a does not                               definition.

                         a b [ pronounced as "a does not divide b"]

Do  not  confuse  the  notation  a  |  b  with  ab .  The  notation  a  represents  a  fraction.  It  is  also  written
                                                                     b

as a/b with a (forward) slash. It uses floating-point (that is, real or decimal) division. For

example,  11  =   2.75.

    The definition of divisibility is very important. Many students fail to finish very simple

proofs because they cannot recall the definition. So here we go again:

                                    a | b  b = aq for some integer q.

Both integers a and b can be positive or negative, and b could even be 0. The only restriction

is a = 0. In addition, q must be an integer. For instance, 3 = 2 · 32 , but it is certainly absurd to
say that 2 divides 3.

Example 5.3.1 Since 14 = (-2) · (-7), it is clear that -2 | 14.

by finding the quotient q and the remainder r such that b = aq + r, and r = 0 if a | b.

                        Example 5.3.2 An integer is even if and only if it is divisible by 2, and it is odd if and only

nonzero integer.        Hands-On Exercise 5.3.3 Complete the following sentence:

                             · If n is not divisible by 3, then n =       , or n =           , for some integer  .

                        Compare this to the div and mod operations. What are the possible values of n mod 3?

                        Example 5.3.3 Given any integer a = 0, we always have a | 0 because 0 = a · 0. In particular,
                        0 is divisible by 2, hence it is considered an even integer.

                        Example 5.3.4 Similarly, ±1 and ±b divide b for any nonzero integer b. They are called the
                        trivial divisors of a. A divisor of b that is not a trivial divisor is called a nontrivial divisor
                        of b.

                            For example, the integer 15 has eight divisors: ±1, ±3, ±5, ±15. Its trivial divisors are ±1
                        and ±15, and the nontrivial divisors are ±3 and ±5.

                        Definition. A positive integer a is a proper divisor of b if a | b and a < |b|. If a is a proper

                        divisor of b, we say that a divides b properly .                                         

                        Remark. Some number theorists include negative numbers as proper divisors. In this con-

                        vention, a is a proper divisor of b if a | b, and |a| < |b|. To add to the confusion, some number

                        theorists exclude ±1 as proper divisors. Use caution when you encounter these terms.     

                        Example 5.3.5 It is clear that 12 divides 132 properly, and 2 divides -14 properly as well.
                        The integer 11 has no proper divisor.

                        Hands-On Exercise 5.3.4 What are the proper divisors of 132?

                        Definition. An integer p > 1 is a prime if its positive divisors are 1 and p itself. Any integer

                        greater than 1 that is not a prime is called composite.                                  

                        Remark. A positive integer n is composite if it has a divisor d that satisfies 1 < d < n. Also,

                        according to the definition, the integer 1 is neither prime nor composite.               

                        Example 5.3.6 The integers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, . . . are primes.

Theorem 5.3.1 There are infinitely many primes.

Proof: We postpone its proof to a later section, after we prove a fundamental result in number
theory.

Theorem 5.3.2 For all integers a, b, and c where a = 0, we have

(1) If a | b, then a | xb for any integer x.

(2) If a | b and b | c, then a | c. (This is called the transitive property of divisibility.)

(3) If a | b and a | c, then a | (sb + tc) for any integers x and y.  (The expression sb + tc is
     called a linear combination of b and c.)

(4) If b = 0 and a | b and b | a, then a = ±b.

(5) If a | b and a, b > 0, then a  b.

Proof: We shall only prove (1), (4), and (5), and leave the proofs of (2) and (3) as exercises.

Proof of (1). Assume a | b, we want to show that a | xb for any integer x. Since a | b, there
exists an integer q such that b = aq. For any integer x, we have

                                       xb = x · aq = a · xq,

where xq is an integer. Hence, a | xb.

Proof of (4). Assume a | b and b | a, we want to show that a = ±b. Since a | b, there exists
an integer q such that b = aq. Likewise, b | a implies that there exists an integer q such that
a = bq . It follows that

                                                    a = bq = aq · q .

This implies that qq = 1. Both q and q are integers. Thus, each of them must be either 1 or
-1, which makes b = ±a.

Proof of (5). Assume a | b and a, b > 0, we want to show that a  b. Since a | b, we have b = aq,
for some integer q. Since a, b > 0, we also have q > 0. Being an integer, we must have q  1.
Then b = aq  a · 1 = a.

Example 5.3.7 Use the definition of divisibility to show that given any integers a, b, and c,
where a = 0, if a | b and a | c, then a | (sb2 + tc2) for any integers s and t.

Solution: We try to prove it from first principles, that is, using only the definition of divisibility.
Here is the complete proof.

Assume a | b and a | c. There exist integers x and y such that b = ax and c = ay.

Then

                  sb2 + tc2 = s(ax)2 + t(ay)2 = a(sax2 + tay2),

where sax2 + tay2 is an integer. Hence a | (sb2 + tc2).

The key step is substituting b = ax and c = ay into the expression sb2 + tc2. You may ask, how

can we know this is the right thing to do?
    Here is the reason. We want to show that a | (sb2 + tc2). This means we need to find an

integer which, when multiplied by a, yields sb2 + tc2. This calls for writing sb2 + tc2 as a product

of a and another integer that is yet to be determined. Since s and t bear no relationship to

a, our only hope lies in b and c. We do know that b = ax and c = ay, therefore, we should
substitute them into sb2 + tc2.

Summary and Review

    · An integer b is divisible by a nonzero integer a if and only if there exists an integer q such
       that b = aq.

5.4 Greatest Common Divisors                                                                        gcd(a, b) is always
                                                                                                    positive.
Given any two integers a and b, an integer c = 0 is a common divisor or common factor of
a and b if c divides both a and b. If, in addition, a and b are not both equal to zero, then the
greatest common divisor , denoted by gcd(a, b), is defined as the largest common divisor of
a and b. Greatest common divisors are also called highest common factors. It should be clear
that gcd(a, b) must be positive.

Example 5.4.1 The common divisors of 24 and 42 are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6. Among them, 6
is the largest. Therefore, gcd(24, 42) = 6. The common divisors of 12 and 32 are ±1, ±2 and
±4, it follows that gcd(12, 32) = 4.

Hands-On Exercise 5.4.1 Verify that

         gcd(5, 35) = 5, gcd(-5, 10) = 5, gcd(20, -10) = 10, and gcd(20, 70) = 10.

Explain why gcd(3, 5) = 1.

Example 5.4.2 Can you explain why gcd(0, 3) = 3? How about gcd(0, -3) = 3?

Solution: Recall that 0 is divisible by any nonzero integer. Hence, all the divisors of 3 are also
divisors of 0. Obviously, 3 itself is the largest divisor of 3. Therefore, gcd(0, 3) = 3.

Hands-On Exercise 5.4.2 Explain why gcd(0, -8) = 8.

Theorem 5.4.1 For any nonzero integer b, we have gcd(0, b) = |b|.                                   If b = 0, then
                                                                                                    gcd(0, b) = |b|.
Proof: The largest positive divisor of b is |b|. Since |b| also divides 0, we conclude that
gcd(0, b) = |b|.                                                                                    Assume 1  a  b.

    Theorem 5.4.1 tells us that gcd(0, b) = |b| if b is nonzero. From the definition of common      The main theorem.
divisor and greatest common divisor, it is clear that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a), and gcd(a, b) =
gcd(±a, ±b). So we may assume 1  a  b.

Theorem 5.4.2 Let a and b be integers such that 1  a  b. If b = aq + r, where 0  r < a,
then gcd(b, a) = gcd(a, r).

Proof: To facilitate our argument, let d = gcd(b, a) and e = gcd(a, r). We shall prove that
d = e by showing that, separately, d  e, and e  d.

    By definition, d is a divisor of both b and a. Therefore, b = dx and a = dy for some integers
x and y. Then

                                      r = b - aq = dx - dy · q = d(x - yq),

where x - yq is an integer. Hence, d | r. This makes d a common divisor of both r and a. Since
e is the greatest common divisor of a and r, we determine that d  e.
154                                               Chapter 5 Basic Number Theory

    Similarly, e = gcd(a, r) is a divisor of both a and r. Thus, a = eu and r = ev for some
integers u and v. Then

                                      b = aq + r = a · eu + ev = e(au + v),

where au + v is an integer. Hence, e | b. This makes e a common divisor of both b and a. Since
d is the greatest common divisor of b and a, we deduce that e  d. Together with d  e, we
conclude that d = e.

Example 5.4.3 From 997 = 996 · 1 + 1, we obtain gcd(997, 996) = gcd(996, 1) = 1.

    The theorem assures that gcd(b, a) = gcd(a, r). We can apply the theorem again to gcd(a, r).
Dividing a by r produces a new quotient and a new remainder. If necessary, repeat the process
until the remainder becomes zero. If we denote b = r0 and a = r1, then

                 r0 = r1q1 + r2,                       0  r2 < r1,
                                                       0  r3 < r2,
                 r1 = r2q2 + r3,                       0  r4 < r3,

                 r2 = r3q3 + r4,                       0  rk+1 < rk,

                 . ..            ...                   0  rn < rn-1,
                                                       rn+1 = 0.
                 rk-1 = rkqk + rk+1,

                 ...           ...

                 rn-2 = rn-1qn-1 + rn,

                 rn-1 = rnqn + rn+1,

It follows that

     gcd(b, a) = gcd(r0, r1) = gcd(r1, r2) = · · · = gcd(rn, rn+1) = gcd(rn, 0) = rn.

The last nonzero remainder is gcd(a, b). This method for finding the greatest common divisor
is called Euclidean algorithm.

Example 5.4.4 Find gcd(426, 246).

Solution: By applying the theorem repeatedly, we find

                 426 = 246 · 1 + 180,  gcd(426, 246) = gcd(246, 180)
                 246 = 180 · 1 + 66,   gcd(246, 180) = gcd(180, 66)
                 180 = 66 · 2 + 48,    gcd(180, 66) = gcd(66, 48)
                  66 = 48 · 1 + 18,    gcd(66, 48) = gcd(48, 18)
                  48 = 18 · 2 + 12,    gcd(48, 18) = gcd(18, 12)
                  18 = 12 · 1 + 6,     gcd(18, 12) = gcd(12, 6)
                  12 = 6 · 2 + 0,      gcd(12, 6) = gcd(6, 0) = 6.

Therefore, gcd(426, 246) = 6.

                                                         246
                                                         180

In the next round, perform another short division on the two numbers 246 and 180 at the
bottom. Since the larger number is now on the right column, leave the quotient to its right:

                              1 426 246 1
                                  246 180
                                  180 66

Continue in this manner until the remainder becomes 0. The last nonzero entry at the bottom
is the greatest common divisor. We can also leave all the quotients on the left:

1 426 246 1                                         1 426 246

                       Hands-On Exercise 5.4.6 Use the two-column format to compute gcd(6958, 2478).

                           Given any integers m and n, the numbers of the form ms + nt, where s, t are integers, are
                       called the linear combinations of m and n. They play an important role in the study of
                       gcd(m, n), as indicated in the next theorem.

                       Theorem 5.4.3 For any nonzero integers a and b, there exist integers s and t such that
                       gcd(a, b) = as + bt.

                       Proof: The proof of this theorem is lengthy and complicated. We leave it, along with other
                       related results, many of which are rather technical, to the next section.

                       Theorem 5.4.4 Every linear combination of a and b is a multiple of gcd(a, b).

                       Corollary 5.4.5 The greatest common divisor of two nonzero integers a and b is the smallest
                       positive integer among all their linear combinations.

                           It is important to understand what these three results say. Finding a linear combination of
                       a and b only gives us a multiple of gcd(a, b). Only a special linear combination will produce the
                       exact value of gcd(a, b).

                       Example 5.4.5 Let n and n + 1 be two consecutive positive integers. Then

                                                                     n · (-1) + (n + 1) · 1 = 1

                       implies that 1 is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of n and n + 1. This means the
                       greatest common divisor must be 1. Therefore, gcd(n, n + 1) = 1 for all integers n.

                       Definition. Two integers a and b are said to be relatively prime if gcd(a, b) = 1. Therefore,

                       a and b are relatively prime if they have no common divisors except ±1.                      

                       Example 5.4.6 Prove that if gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a + b, a - b) equals to 1 or 2.

A linear combination   Solution: From the linear combinations
is only a multiple of
the gcd.                                                           (a + b) · 1 + (a - b) · 1 = 2a,
                                                              (a + b) · 1 + (a - b) · (-1) = 2b,

                       we know that gcd(a + b, a - b) divides both 2a and 2b. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, we conclude that
                       gcd(a + b, a - b) divides 2. Consequently, gcd(a + b, a - b) is either 1 or 2.

                       Example 5.4.7 Show that if gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(2a + b, a + 2b) equals to either 1 or 3.
5.4 Greatest Common Divisors                                                        157

Solution: From the linear combinations

                                      (2a + b) · 2 + (a + 2b) · (-1) = 3a,
                                      (2a + b) · (-1) + (a + 2b) · 2 = 3b,

we know that gcd(2a + b, a + 2b) divides both 3a and 3b. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, we conclude that
gcd(2a + b, a + 2b) divides 3. Thus, gcd(a + b, a - b) is 1 or 3.

Hands-On Exercise 5.4.7 What are the possible values of gcd(5m + 7n, 7m + 5n) if the two
positive integers m and n are relatively prime?

Example 5.4.8 Find the integers s and t such that 6 = gcd(426, 246) = 246s + 426t.

Solution: Earlier, we studied how to find gcd(426, 246) = 6. In each division, we want to
express the remainder as a linear combination of 246 and 426. This is how the computation
proceeds:

426 = 246 · 1 + 180,  180 = 246 · (-1) + 426 · 1
246 = 180 · 1 + 66,
180 = 66 · 2 + 48,     66 = 246 · 1 + 180 · (-1)
66 = 48 · 1 + 18,            = 246 · 1 + [246 · (-1) + 426 · 1] · (-1)
48 = 18 · 2 + 12,            = 246 · 2 + 426 · (-1)
18 = 12 · 1 + 6,
                       48 = 180 · 1 + 66 · (-2)
                             = [246 · (-1) + 426 · 1] · 1 + [246 · 2 + 426 · (-1)] · (-2)
                             = 246(-5) + 426 · 3

                       18 = 66 · 1 + 48 · (-1)
                             = [246 · 2 + 426 · (-1)] · 1 + [246(-5) + 426 · 3] · (-1)
                             = 246 · 7 + 426 · (-4)

                       12 = 48 · 1 + 18 · (-2)
                             = [246(-5) + 426 · 3] · 1 + [246 · 7 + 426 · (-4)] · (-2)
                             = 246 · (-19) + 426 · 11

                         6 = 18 · 1 + 12 · (-1)
                             = [246 · 7 + 426 · (-4)] · 1 + [246 · (-19) + 426 · 11] · (-1)
                             = 246 · 26 + 426 · (-15)

The answer is 6 = 246 · 26 + 426 · (-15).

    The computation is tedious! The extended Euclidean algorithm provides a relief. It
keeps track of two sequences of integers sk and tk alongside with rk, such that

                                                     rk = ask + btk.

This expresses every remainder as a linear combination of a and b. Since the last nonzero
remainder is gcd(a, b), the corresponding linear combination will be the answer we are looking
for.
158  Chapter 5 Basic Number Theory

    The values of sk and tk for the last example are summarized below:

                                                 k rk sk tk
                                                 2 180 -1 1
                                                 3 66 2 -1
                                                 4 48 -5 3
                                                 5 18 7 -4
                                                 6 12 -19 11
                                                 7 6 26 -15

The main issue is: how can we compute these values efficiently?
    The table above starts with k = 2. How about k = 0 and k = 1? From

                                                  b = r0 = as0 + bt0,

we determine that s0 = 0 and t0 = 1. Similarly,

                                                  a = r1 = as1 + bt1

implies that s1 = 1 and t1 = 0. Hence, the list of values of sk and tk start with the following:

                                                        k sk tk
                                                        0 01
                                                        1 10

    In general, before we carry out the kth division rk-1 ÷ rk, we should have already generated
s0 through sk, and t0 through tk. After the division, we obtain qk and rk+1 as in

                                                 rk-1 = rkqk + rk+1.

Next, we compute sk+1 and tk+1 before moving on to the next division. We find

                                  rk+1 = rk-1 - rkqk
                                           = (ask-1 + btk-1) - (ask + btk)qk
                                           = a(sk-1 - skqk) + b(tk-1 - tkqk).

Therefore, we need to set

                                               sk+1 = sk-1 - skqk,
                                               tk+1 = tk-1 - tkqk.

In words:

          next s-value = previous-previous s-value - previous s-value × corresponding q,
           next t-value = previous-previous t-value - previous t-value × corresponding q.

    For example, assume at a certain stage, the values of s, t, and q are as follow:

                                                    k sk tk qk
                                                    001
                                                    1 1 01
                                                    2 -1 1 1
                                                    3 2 -1 2

                                                                        1
                                                                        2
                                                                        1
                                                                        2
5.4 Greatest Common Divisors                                                159

Then

                      next s-value = -1 - 2 · 2 = -5,
                      next t-value = 1 - (-1) · 2 = 3.

Now the list becomes

                                   k sk tk qk
                                   001
                                   1 1 01
                                   2 -1 1 1
                                   3 2 -1 2
                                   4 -5 3 1

                                                      2
                                                      1
                                                      2

The entire computation can be carried out in a modified two-column format.

Example 5.4.9 Find integers s and t such that gcd(246, 426) = 246s + 426t.

Solution: First, copy the quotients from the right-most column and insert them between those
quotients in the left-most column:

                      1 426 246 1  becomes               1 426 246 1
                          246 180                        1 246 180
                                                         2 180 66 1
                      2 180 66 1                         1 132 48
                          132 48                         2 48 18 1
                                                         1 36 12
                      2 48 18 1                          2 12 6
                            36 12
                                                               12
                      2 12 6                                    0
                            12
                             0

Next, compute sk and tk alongside these quotients (we do not need to record the values of k):

                        sk tk      qk
                         01
                         10         1 426 246 1
                       -1 1         1 246 180
                         2 -1       2 180 66 1
                       -5 3         1 132 48
                         7 -4       2 48 18 1
                      -19 11        1 36 12
                        26 -15      2 12 6

                                          12
                                           0

The last nonzero remainder is the greatest common divisor, and the last linear combination
gives the desired answer. We find gcd(246, 426) = 6 = 26 · 246 - 15 · 426.

    Observe that, starting with k = 2, the signs of sk and tk alternate. This provides a quick
check of their signs. In addition, the signs of sk and tk are opposite for each k  2.

In this section, we shall discuss a few technical results about gcd(a, b).                         outline of the proof.

Theorem 5.5.1 Let d = gcd(a, b), where a, b  N. Then                                               Part 1: S  T .

                                                                                                   reduce it to a simpler

Proof: For brevity, let                                                                            element e.

                          S = {as + bt | s, t  Z}, and T = {nd | n  Z}.                            This e is a common
                                                                                                   divisor of a and b.
We shall show that S = T by proving that S  T and T  S.
    Let x  S. To prove that S  T , we want to show that x  T as well. Being in S means             But e is larger than
                                                                                                   the other common
x = as + bt for some integers s and t. Since d = gcd(a, b), we know that d | a and d | b. Hence,   divisors, hence it
a = da and b = db for some integers a and b . Then                                                 must be the gcd.

                                    x = as + bt = da s + db t = d(a s + b t),

where a s + b t is an integer. This shows that x is a multiple of d. Hence, x  T .
    To show that T  S, we need to show that nd  S for any integer n. However, we claim

that it suffices to show that d  S. The reason is, if d = as + bt for some integers s and t, then
nd = n(as + bt) = a(ns) + b(nt) implies that nd  S.

    To prove that d  S, consider S+. Since a = a · 1 + b · 0, we have a  S+. Hence, S+ is a
nonempty set of positive integers. The principle of well-ordering implies that S+ has a smallest
element. Call it e. Then

                                                      e = as + bt

for some integers s and t. We already know that a  S+. Being the smallest element in S+,
we must have e  a. Then a = eq + r for some integers q and r, where 0  r < e. If r > 0, then

                           r = a - eq = a - (as + bt)q = a(1 - sq) + b(-tq).

This makes r a linear combination of a and b. Since r > 0, we find r  S+. Since r < e would
contradict the minimality of e, we must have r = 0. Consequently, a = eq, thus e | a. Similarly,
since b = a · 0 + b · 1  S+, we can apply the same argument to show that e | b. We conclude
that e is a common divisor of a and b.

    Let f be any common divisor of a and b. Then f | a and f | b. It follows that f | (ax + by)
for any integers x and y. In particular, f | (as + bt) = e. Hence, f  e. Since e is itself a
common divisor of a and b, and we have just proved that e is larger than any other common
divisor of a and b, the integer e itself must be the greatest common divisor. It follows that
d = gcd(a, b) = e  S+. The proof is now complete.

Corollary 5.5.2 The greatest common divisor of two nonzero integers a and b is the smallest
positive integer among all their linear combinations. In other words, gcd(a, b) is the smallest
positive element in the set {as + bt | s, t  Z}.

Corollary 5.5.3 For any nonzero integers a and b, there exist integers s and t such that
gcd(a, b) = as + bt.

Proof: Theorem 5.5.1 maintains that the set of all the linear combinations of a and b equals
to the set of all the multiples of gcd(a, b). Since gcd(a, b) is a multiple of itself, it must equal to
one of those linear combinations. Thus, gcd(a, b) = sa + tb for some integers s and t.

Theorem 5.5.4 Two nonzero integers a and b are relatively prime if and only if as + bt = 1
for some integers s and t.

Proof: The result is a direct consequence of the definition that a and b are said to be relatively
prime if gcd(a, b) = 1.

Example 5.5.1 It is clear that 5 and 7 are relatively prime, so are 14 and 27. Find the linear
combination of these two pairs of numbers that equals to 1.

Solution: By inspection, or using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find 3 · 5 - 2 · 7 = 1,
and 2 · 14 - 1 · 27 = 1.

Hands-On Exercise 5.5.1 Show that gcd(133, 143) = 1 by finding an appropriate linear com-
bination.

Hands-On Exercise 5.5.2 Show that 757 and 1215 are relatively prime by finding an appro-
priate linear combination.

Example 5.5.2 It follows from

                               (-1) · n + 1 · (n + 1) = 1

that gcd(n, n + 1) = 1. Thus, any pair of consecutive positive integers is relatively prime.

Theorem 5.5.5 (Euclid's Lemma) Let a, b, c  Z. If gcd(a, c) = 1 and c | ab, then c | b.
Discussion: Let us write down what we know and what we want to show (WTS):

     Know :                    as + ct = 1 for some integers s and t,
     WTS :                     ab = cx for some integer x,
                               b = cq for some integer q.
5.5 More on GCD                                                                    163

To be able to show that b = cq for some integer q, we have to come up with some information
about b. This information must come from the two equations as + ct = 1 and ab = cx. Since
b = b · 1, we can multiply b to both sides of as + ct = 1. By convention, we cannot write

                                                                                                        WRONG notation!

                 (as + ct = 1) · b.

This notation is unacceptable! The reason is: we cannot multiply an equation by a number.
Rather, we have to multiply both sides of an equation by the number:

                 b = 1 · b = (as + ct) · b = asb + ctb.

Obviously, ctb is a multiple of c; we are one step closer to our goal. Since asb = ab · s, and we

do know that ab is indeed a multiple of c, so the proof can be completed. We are now ready to

tie up the loose ends, and polish up the proof.                                    

Proof: Assume gcd(a, c) = 1 and c | ab, we want to show that c | b. Since gcd(a, c) = 1, there
exist integers s and t such that

                                                       as + ct = 1.

This leads to

                 b = 1 · b = (as + ct) · b = asb + ctb.

Since c | ab, there exists an integer x such that ab = cx. Then

                 b = ab · s + ctb = cx · s + ctb = c(xs + tb),

where xc + tb  Z. Therefore, c | b.

Corollary 5.5.6 If a, b  Z and p is a prime such that p | ab, then either p | a or p | b.

Proof: If p | a, we are done with the proof. If p a, then gcd(p, a) = 1, and Euclid's lemma
implies that p | b.

    We cannot apply the corollary if p is composite. For instance, 6 | 4 · 15, but 6 4 and 6 15.
On the other hand, when p | ab, where p is a prime, it is possible to have both p | a and p | b.
For instance, 5 | 15 · 25, yet we have both 5 | 15 and 5 | 25.

Corollary 5.5.7 If a1, a2, . . . , an  Z and p is a prime such that p | a1a2 · · · an, then p | ai for
some i, where 1  i  n. Consequently, if a prime p divides a product of n factors, then p must

divide at least one of these n factors.

Proof: We leave the proof to you as an exercise.
                                       

Example 5.5.3 Prove that 2 is irrational.

                                                    
Remark. We proved previously that 2 is irrational in a hands-on exercise. The solution we
presented has a minor flaw. A key step in that proof claims that

                 The integer 2 divides m2, therefore 2 divides m.

This claim is false in general. For example, 4 divides 62, but 4 does not divide 6. Therefore, we

have to justify why this claim is valid for 2.                                     

                          
Solution: Suppose 2 is rational, then we can write

                 m
                   2=
                         n

for some positive integers m and n that do not share any common divisor except 1.

                            Squaring both sides and cross-multiplying gives
                                                                               2n2 = m2.

This proof works       Thus 2 divides m2. Since 2 is prime, Euclid's lemma implies that 2 must also divide m. Then
because 2 is a prime.  we can write m = 2s for some integer s. The equation above becomes

                                                                     2n2 = m2 = (2s)2 = 4s2.

                       Hence,

                               n2 = 2s2,

                       which implies that 2 divides n2. Again, since 2 is prime, Euclid's lemma implies that 2 also
                       divides n. We have proved that both m and n are divisibleby 2. This contradicts the assumption
                       that m and n do not share any common divisor. Hence, 2 must be irrational.

5.6 Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

Primes are positive integers that do not have any proper divisor except 1. Primes can be
regarded as the building blocks of all integers with respect to multiplication.

Theorem 5.6.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) Given any integer n  2, there
exist primes p1  p2  · · ·  ps such that n = p1p2 . . . ps. Furthermore, this factorization is
unique, in the sense that if n = q1q2 . . . qt for some primes q1  q2  · · ·  qt, then s = t and
pi = qi for each i, 1  i  s.

Proof: We first use contradiction to prove the existence of the factorization. Let S be the set
of integers n  2 that are not expressible as the product of primes. Since a product may contain
as little as just one prime, S does not contain any prime. Suppose S = , then the principle
of well-ordering implies that S has a smallest element d. Since S does not contain any prime,
d is composite, so d = xy for some integers x and y, where 2  x, y < d. The minimality of d
implies that x, y  S. So both x and y can be expressed as products of primes, then d = xy is
also a product of primes, which is a contradiction, because d belongs to S. Therefore, S = ,
which means every integer n  2 can be expressed as a product of primes.

    Next, we prove that the factorization is unique. Assume there are two ways to factor n, say
n = p1p2 . . . ps = q1q2 . . . qt. Without loss of generality, we may assume s  t. Suppose there
exists a smallest i, where 1  i  s, such that pi = qi. Then

                          p1 = q1, p2 = q2, · · · pi-1 = qi-1, but pi = qi.
166              Chapter 5 Basic Number Theory

It follows that

                 pipi+1 · · · ps = qiqi+1 · · · qt,

in which both sides have at least two factors (why?). Without loss of generality, we may assume

pi < qi. Since pi | qiqi+1 · · · qt, and pi is prime, Euclid's lemma implies that pi | qj for some j,
where i < j  t. Since qj is prime, we must have pi = qj  qi, which contradicts the assumption
that pi < qi. Therefore, there does not exist any i for which pi = qi. This means pi = qi for
each i, and as a consequence, we must have have s = t.

    Interestingly, we can use the strong form of induction to prove the existence part of the
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

Proof 2: (Existence) Induct on n. The claim obviously holds for n = 2. Assume it holds for
n = 2, 3, . . . , k for some integer k  2. We want to show that it also holds for k + 1. If k + 1 is
a prime, we are done. Otherwise, k + 1 =  for some integers  and , both less than k + 1.
Since 2  ,   k, both  and  can be expressed as a product of primes. Putting these primes
together, and relabeling and rearranging them if necessary, we see that k + 1 is also expressible
as a product of primes in the form we desire. This completes the induction.

    The next result is one of the oldest theorems in mathematics, numerous proofs can be found
in the literature.

Theorem 5.6.2 There are infinitely many primes.

Proof: Suppose there are only a finite number of primes p1, p2, . . . , pn. Consider the integer

                                                  x = 1 + p1p2 · · · pn.

It is obvious that x = pi for any i. Since p1, p2, . . . , pn are assumed to be the only primes, the
integer x must be composite, hence can be factored into a product of primes. Let pk be one of
these prime factors, so that x = pkq for some integer q. Then

                                     1 = x - p1p2 · · · pn
                                         = pkq - p1p2 · · · pn
                                         = pk(q - p1p2 · · · pk-1pk+1 · · · pn),

which is impossible. This contradiction proves that there are infinitely many primes.

    Some of the primes listed in the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic can be identical. If we
group the identical primes together, we obtain the canonical factorization or prime-power
factorization of an integer.

Theorem 5.6.3 All integers n  2 can be uniquely expressed in the form n = pe1 1 pe2 2 · · · pet t for
some distinct primes pi and positive integers ei.

    Once we find the prime-power factorization of two integers, their greatest common divisor
can be obtained easily.

Example 5.6.1 From the factorizations 246 = 2 · 3 · 41 and 426 = 2 · 3 · 79, it is clear that
gcd(246, 426) = 2 · 3 = 6.

    Although the set of primes that divide two different positive integers a and b may be different,
we could nevertheless write both a and b as the product of powers of all the primes involved.
For example, by combining the prime factors of

                             12300 = 22 · 3 · 52 · 41, and 34128 = 24 · 33 · 79,

we could write them as
                  12300 = 22 · 31 · 52 · 411 · 790, and 34128 = 24 · 33 · 50 · 410 · 791.

It follows that

                 gcd(12300, 34128) = 22 · 31 · 50 · 410 · 790 = 12.

The generalization is immediate.

Theorem 5.6.4 If a = p1e1 p2e2 · · · ptet and b = p1f1 p2f2 · · · ptft for some distinct primes pi, where
ei, fi  0 for each i, then gcd(a, b) = p1min(e1,f1)p2min(e2,f2) · · · ptmin(et,ft).

    In this theorem, we allow the exponents to be zero. In the usual prime-power factorization,
the exponents have to be positive.

Definition. The least common multiple of the integers a and b, denoted lcm(a, b), is the

smallest positive common multiple of both a and b.                                         

Theorem 5.6.5 If a = p1e1 p2e2 · · · ptet and b = p1f1 p2f2 · · · ptft for some distinct primes pi, where
ei, fi  0 for each i, then lcm(a, b) = p1max(e1,f1)p2max(e2,f2) · · · ptmax(et,ft).

Hands-On Exercise 5.6.3 Compute lcm(23 · 5 · 7 · 112, 22 · 32 · 52 · 72).

Corollary 5.6.6 For any positive integers a and b, we have ab = gcd(a, b) · lcm(a, b).

Proof: For each i, one of the two numbers ei and fi is the minimum, and the other is the
maximum. Hence,

                                        ei + fi = min(ei, fi) + max(ei, fi),
from which we obtain

                       piei pifi = piei+fi = pimin(ei,fi)+max(fi,fi) = pimin(ei,fi)pimax(ei,fi).

Therefore, ab equals the product of gcd(a, b) and lcm(a, b).

Example 5.6.2    Since 12300 = 22 · 31 · 52 · 411 · 790, and 34128 = 24 · 33 · 50 · 410 · 791, it follows
that                lcm(12300, 34128) = 24 · 33 · 52 · 411 · 791 = 34981200.

We have seen that gcd(12300, 34128) = 12, and we do have 12 · 34981200 = 12300 · 34128.

Hands-On Exercise 5.6.4 Knowing that gcd(246, 426) = 6, how would you compute the value
of lcm(246, 426)?

Example 5.6.3 When we add two fractions, we first take the common denominator, as in

     7 5 7 3 5 2 21 + 10 31
     + =·+ ·=           =.
     8 12 8 3 12 2  24  24

Clear enough, the least common denominator is precisely the least common multiple of the two
denominators.

Example 5.6.4 The control panel of a machine has two signal lights, one red and one blue.
The red light blinks once every 10 seconds, and the blue light blinks once every 14 seconds.
When the machine is turned on, both lights blink simultaneously. After how many seconds will
they blink at the same time again?

Solution: This problem illustrates a typical application of least common multiple. The red
light blinks at 10, 20, 30, . . . seconds, while the blue light blinks at 14, 28, 42, . . . seconds. In
general, the red light blinks at t seconds if t is a multiple of 10, and the blue light blinks when
t is a multiple of 14. Therefore, both lights blink together when t is a multiple of both 10 and
14. The next time it happens will be lcm(10, 14) = 70 seconds later.

Hands-On Exercise 5.6.6 Given relatively prime positive integers m and n, what are the
possible values of lcm(4m - 6n, 6m + 4n)?

Example 5.6.5 What does 2Z  3Z equal to?

Solution: Assume x  2Z  3Z, then x  2Z and x  3Z. This means x is a multiple of
both 2 and 3. Consequently, x is a multiple of lcm(2, 3) = 6, which means x  6Z. Therefore,
2Z  3Z  6Z.
5.6 Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic                                          169

    Next, assume x  6Z, then x is a multiple of 6. Consequently, x is a multiple of 2, as well
as a multiple of 3. This means x  2Z, and x  3Z. As a result, x  2Z  3Z. Therefore,
6Z  2Z  3Z. Together with 2Z  3Z  6Z, we conclude that 2Z  3Z = 6Z.

                 5.7 Modular Arithmetic

                 Modular arithmetic uses only a fixed number of possible results in all its computation. For
                 instance, there are only 12 hours on the face of a clock. If the time now is 7 o'clock, 20 hours later
                 will be 3 o'clock; and we do not say 27 o'clock! This example explains why modular arithmetic
                 is referred to by some as clock arithmetic.

                 Example 5.7.1 Assume the current time is 2:00 p.m. Write this as 14:00. Sixty five hours
                 later, it would be 79:00. Since

                                                                      79 = 24 · 3 + 7,

                 it will be 7:00 or 7 a.m.

                 now? Assume there are 365 days in a year.

                     In the clock example, we essentially regard 27 o'clock the same as 3 o'clock. They key is, we
                 are only interested in the remainder when a value is divided by 12.

m1  m2 (mod n)   Definition. Let n  2 be a fixed integer. We say the two integers m1 and m2 are congruent
 n | (m1 - m2).  modulo n, denoted

                                                                  m1  m2 (mod n)

                 if and only if n | (m1 - m2). The integer n is called the modulus of the congruence.

                     What does this notion of congruence have to do with remainders? The next result describes
                 their connection.

                 Theorem 5.7.1 Let n  2 be a fixed integer. For any two integers m1 and m2,

                                              m1  m2 (mod n)  m1 mod n = m2 mod n.

                 Remark. Do not confuse the two notations. The notation "(mod n)" after m1  m2 indicates

                 a congruence relation, in which "mod n" are enclosed by a pair of parentheses, and the notation

                 is placed at the end of the congruence. In contrast, the "mod" between m1 and n, without

                 parentheses, is a binary operation that yields the remainder when m1 is divided by n.

Proof: () Assume m1  m2 (mod n). The definition of congruence implies that we have              Recall the definition
n | (m1 - m2). Hence,                                                                           of congruence.

                                                                                                modular arithmetic
for some integer q. Let m1 = nq1 + r1 and m2 = nq2 + r2 for some integers q1, q2, r1, r2, such  is always between 0
that 0  r1, r2 < n. Then                                                                        and n - 1, inclusive.

        nq = m1 - m2 = n(q1 - q2) + r1 - r2.

Since r1 - r2 = n(q - q1 + q2), we conclude that n | r1 - r2. However, 0  r1, r2 < n
implies that |r1 - r2| < n. Therefore, we must have r1 - r2 = 0, or r1 = r2. It follows that
m1 mod n = m2 mod n.

() Assume m1 mod n = m2 mod n. According to the Division Algorithm, the remainder in
an integer division is unique. Thus, m1 = nq1 + r and m2 = nq2 + r for some integers q1, q2, r
such that 0  r < n. Then

        m1 - m2 = (nq1 + r) - (nq2 + r) = n(q1 - q2).

Therefore, n | (m1 - m2); that is, m1  m2 (mod n).

Corollary 5.7.2 Let n  2 be a fixed integer. Then

                        a  0 (mod n)  n | a.

    Theorem 5.7.1 tells us m1  m2 (mod n) if and only if m1 and m2 share the same remainder
when they are divided by n. Given any integer m,

                        m mod n  {0, 1, 2, . . . , n - 1}.

We call these values the residues modulo n. In modular arithmetic, when we say "reduced
modulo n," we mean whatever result we obtain, we divide it by n, and report only the smallest
possible nonnegative residue.

    The next theorem is fundamental to modular arithmetic.

Theorem 5.7.3 Let n  2 be a fixed integer. If a  b (mod n) and c  d (mod n), then

                        a+c  b+d                    (mod n),
                           ac  bd                   (mod n).

Proof:  Assume a  b (mod n) and c  d (mod n). Then n | (a - b) and n | (c - d). We can
write                               a - b = ns, and c - d = nt

for some integers s and t. Consequently,

        (a + c) - (b + d) = (a - b) + (c - d) = ns + nt = n(s + t),

where s + t is an integer. This proves that a + c  b + d (mod n). We also have
                ac - bd = (b + ns)(d + nt) - bd = bnt + nsd + n2st = n(bt + sd + nst),

where bt + sd + nst is an integer. Thus, n | (ac - bd), which means ac  bd (mod n).

    Because of Theorem 5.7.3, we can add or multiply an integer to both sides of a congruence
without altering the congruence.

Example 5.7.2 We can use subtraction to reduce 2370 modulo 11. Any multiple of 11 is
congruent to 0 modulo 11. So we have, for example,

                       2370  2370 (mod 11), and 0  -2200 (mod 11).
                       172                                               Chapter 5 Basic Number Theory

Use subtraction to     Applying Theorem 5.7.3, we obtain
reduce m modulo n.
                                                            2370  2370 - 2200 = 170 (mod 11).

                       What this means is: we can keep subtracting appropriate multiples of n from m until the answer
                       is between 0 and n - 1, inclusive. It does not matter which multiple of 11 you use. The point
                       is, pick one that you can think of quickly, and keep repeating the process. Continuing in this
                       fashion, we find

                                                               170  170 - 110 = 60 (mod 11).
                       Since 60 - 55 = 5, we determine that 2370  5 (mod 11).

                       it is obvious that 52  52 - 44 = 8 (mod 11). Thus, -278  8 (mod 11).

                           In a complicated computation, reduce the result from each intermediate step before you
                       carry on with the next step. This will simplify the computation tremendously. To further speed
                       up the computation, we can use negative values in the intermediate step. Nonetheless, the final
                       answer must be between 0 and n - 1.

                       Therefore,

Example 5.7.5 Show that if an integer n is not divisible by 3, then n2 - 1 is always divisible

Solution 1:  Let n be an integer not divisible by 3, then either n  1 (mod 3), or n  2              We do not need to

In both cases, we have found that n2 - 1 is divisible by 3.

Solution 2: Let n be an integer not divisible by 3, then either n  1 (mod 3), or n  2

    Raising an integer to a large power poses a serious problem. We cannot just raise an integer
to a large power, because the result could be so large that the calculator or computer has to
convert it into a decimal value and start using scientific notation to handle it. Consequently,
the answer will not be accurate.

    A better solution is to reduce the intermediate results modulo n after each multiplication.
This will produce an accurate result, but it will take a long time to finish if the power is huge.

                      Example 5.7.6 Evaluate 529 (mod 11).

Write 29 as a sum of  Solution: First, write the exponent 29 as a sum of powers of 2. We can do it by inspection.
powers of 2.          Start with the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 29, and then work with whatever
                      is left in the sum:
The method of
repeated squaring.                                      29 = 16 + 13 = 16 + 8 + 5 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 1.

                      We are essentially expressing 29 in base 2. We can now write

                                                              529 = 516+8+4+1 = 516 · 58 · 54 · 5.

                      These powers of 5 can be obtained by means of repeated squaring :

                                                  51 = 5,

                                                  52 = 52,

                                                  54 = (52)2,

                                                  58 = (54)2,

                                             516 = (58)2,

                                                  ...                    ...

                      The iteration is simple: each new power is obtained by squaring the previous power. Since we
                      are doing modular arithmetic, we want to reduce each intermediate result modulo 11:

                                       5 =5                                       (mod 11)
                                                                                  (mod 11)
                                       52 = 25                        3           (mod 11)
                                                                                  (mod 11)
                                       54  32 =                       9  -2       (mod 11)

                                       58  92  (-2)2 = 4

                                       516  42 =            16  5

                      It follows that

                                       529 = 516 · 58 · 54 · 5  5 · 4 · (-2) · 5  (mod 11).

                      After simplification, we find 529  9 (mod 11).

Hands-On Exercise 5.7.8 Use repeated squaring to evaluate 958 (mod 23).

    In modular arithmetic, we are basically working with the remainders only. The set of integers  Zn is pronounced
                                                                                                   Z mod n.
{0, 1, 2, . . . , n - 1} is called the set of integers modulo n, and is denoted by Zn (pronounced
as Z mod n). In addition, we define two new arithmetic operations on Zn. They are called
"addition" and "multiplication" because they work like the usual addition and multiplication,

except that we have to apply the mod operation to the results. To distinguish them from the

usual addition and multiplication, we denote them by  and , and are called "circled plus"

and "circled dot," respectively. Formally,

a  b = (a + b) mod n, and a b = (a · b) mod n.

The addition and multiplication tables for Z6 are listed below.

In both addition tables, all possible values appear in every row and every column. The same

is true in the nonzero rows and nonzero columns in the multiplication table for Z7. However,
some of the rows in the multiplication table for Z6 do not contain all the integers in Z6. This
suggests that the algebraic properties of Zn depend on the value of n.

    In fact, whenever n is prime, the addition and multiplication tables of Zn behave like the
ones in Z7. It can be shown that when n is prime, Zn has the following properties.
176                                                            Chapter 5 Basic Number Theory

1. Both  and are commutative, meaning that

                               a  b = b  a and a b = b a

   for all a, b  Zn.
2. Both  and are associative, meaning that

                 (a  b)  c = a  (b  c) and (a b) c = a (b c)

   for all a, b, c  Zn.             satisfy the distributive laws
3. The operations  and

          a (b  c) = (a b)  (a c) and (b  c) a = (b a)  (c a)

   for all a, b, c  Zn.

4. The integer 0 is the additive identity , meaning that a  0 = 0  a = a for all a  Zn.

5. For every a  Zn, there exists a unique integer a  Zn such that a  a = 0. This integer
   a is called the additive inverse or negative of a, and is denoted by -a.

6. The integer 1 is the multiplicative identity , meaning that a                  1=1      a = a for all
   a  Zn.

7.   For  every  integer  a    Z    (hence,  a  =  0),  there  exists  a  unique  nonzero  integer  a   Zn

                                 n

     such that a a = 1. This integer a is called the multiplicative inverse or reciprocal

     of a, and is denoted by a-1.

Example 5.7.7    From the tables above, only 1 and 5 have multiplicative inverses in Z6. In
fact,                        1 · 1 = 1 and 5 · 5 = 1 in Z6

imply that 1-1 = 1, and 5-1 = 5 in Z6. On the other hand, every nonzero integer in Z7 has a
multiplicative inverse:

          1-1 = 1, 2-2 = 4, 3-1 = 5, 4-1 = 2, 5-1 = 3, and 6-1 = 6.

Be sure to verify these inverses.

    In general, given any set of numbers, we can define arithmetic operations in any way we like,
provided that they obey certain rules. This produces an algebraic structure. For example,
we call a set of elements S with two binary operations denoted  and a field , and write
 S, , or (S, , ), if it satisfies all seven properties listed above. Both R, +, · and Q, +, ·
are fields, but Z, +, · is not, because multiplicative inverse of a does not exist if a = ±1.

Theorem 5.7.4 The algebraic structure Zn, , is a field if and only if n is prime.

Proof: Verification of most of the properties is rather straightforward, with the exception of
the existence of the multiplicative inverse, which we shall prove here. Since n is a prime, any
a  Z must be relatively prime to n. Hence,

                                                       as + nt = 1

for some integers s and t. Modulo n, we find nt = 0, hence as + nt = 1 becomes

                                                          as = 1.

Therefore a-1  s (mod n).
5.7 Modular Arithmetic                                 177

    The theorem tells us that if n is prime, then Zn is a field, hence every nonzero integer has a
multiplicative inverse.

Example 5.7.8 Determine 7-1 (mod 29).

Solution: We want to find a number a such that 7a  1 (mod 29). Note that gcd(7, 29) = 1.
Using extended Euclidean algorithm, we find

                                                  7(-4) + 29 · 1 = 1.
Since 29 · 1  0 (mod 29), after reducing modulo 29, we find

                                                7(-4)  1 (mod 29).
This implies that 7-1  -4  25 (mod 29).

    When n is composite, Zn is not a field. Then not every nonzero integer in it has a multi-
plicative inverse. Of course, some special nonzero integers may still have multiplicative inverses.

Hands-On Exercise 5.7.9 Determine 8-1 (mod 45).

Example 5.7.9 Solve the equation 7x - 3 = 5 over Z29.                                                To simulate division,
Solution: From 7x - 3 = 5, we find 7x = 8. Recall that what this equation really means is            we have to multiply
                                                                                                     by the multiplicative
                                                  7x  8 (mod 29).                                    inverse.
The answer is not x = 87 , because Z29 only contains integers as its elements. This is what we
should do: multiply 7-1 to both sides of the congruence:

                                           7-1 · 7x  7-1 · 8 (mod 29).
Since 7-1 · 7  1 (mod 29), we now have

                                               x  7-1 · 8 (mod 29).
In a way, we use multiplicative inverse to simulate division. In this case, 7-1  7 (mod 29).
Hence, x  7 · 8  27 (mod 29).

Hands-On Exercise 5.7.10 Solve the equation 8x + 23 = 12 over Z45.

Example 5.7.10 Explain why 3-1 does not exist in Z24.
178                                            Chapter 5 Basic Number Theory

Solution:  Suppose 3-1 exists in Z24, say, 3-1  z (mod 24). This means 3z  1 (mod 24).
Hence,                                            3z = 24q + 1

for some integer q. This in turn implies that

           1 = 3z - 24q = 3(z - 8q),

which is clearly impossible because z - 8q is an integer. This contradiction shows that 3-1 does
not exist in Z24.

    Both R and Q are infinite fields, while Zn is a finite field when n is prime. The next result
is a truly amazing one, because it proclaims that the number of elements in any finite field (one

with finitely many elements) must be the power of a certain prime. Unfortunately, we are unable

to prove it here, because it is beyond the scope of this course.

Theorem 5.7.5 There exists a finite field of n elements if and only if n is the power of a prime.

Summary and Review

    · Modular arithmetic modulo n uses the mod operation to reduce the answers of all com-
       putation to within 0 through n - 1.

    · Instead of waiting until we obtain the final answer before we reduce it modulo n, it is
       easier to reduce every immediate result modulo n before moving on to the next step in the

       computation.
    · We can use negative integers in the intermediate steps.
    · The set of integers {0, 1, 2, . . . , n - 1}, together with modular arithmetic modulo n, is

       denoted as Zn.
    · For a · a  1 (mod n), we say that a is the multiplicative inverse of a, and denote it a-1.
    · For some a  Zn, the multiplicative inverse a-1 may not exist. If it exists, we can use it

       to simulate division.

Functions

6.1 Functions: An Introduction

The functions we studied in calculus are real functions, which are defined over a set of real
numbers, and the results they produce are also real. In this chapter, we shall study their
generalization over other sets. The definition could be difficult to grasp at the beginning, so we
would start with a brief introduction.

    Most students view real functions as computational devices. However, in the generalization,
functions are not restricted to computation only. A better way to look at functions is their
input-output relationship. Let f denote a function. Given an element (which need not be a
number) from a set, we call the result from f the image of x under f , and write f (x), which
is read as "f of x."

    Imagine f as a machine. It takes the input value x, and returns f (x) as the output value.
This input-output relationship is depicted in Figure 6.1 in two different ways.

               x
               c

x E f E f (x)     f
                             E f (x)

                       Figure 6.1: Two pictorial views of a function as a machine.

    The question is: how could we obtain f (x)? A function need not involve any computation.
Consequently, we cannot speak of "computing" the value of f (x). Instead, we talk about what
is the rule we follow to obtain f (x). This rule can be described in many forms. We can, of
course, use a computational rule. But a table, an algorithm, or even a verbal description also
work as well.

    When we say a real function is defined over the real numbers, we mean the input values must
be real numbers. The output values are also real numbers. In general, the input and output
values need not be of the same type. The nearest integer function, denoted [x], rounds
the real number x to the nearest integer. Here, the images (the output values) are integers.
Consequently, we need to distinguish the set of input values from the set of possible output
values. We call them the domain and the codomain, respectively, of the function.

Example 6.1.1 When a professor reports the final letter grades for the students in her class,
we can regard this as a function g. The domain is the set of students in her class, and the
codomain could be the set of letter grades {A, B, C, D, F }.
182                              Chapter 6 Functions

    We said the codomain is the set of possible output values, because not every element in the
codomain needs to appear as the image of some element from the domain. If no student fails
the professor's class in Example 6.1.1, no one will receive the final grade F. The collection of the
images (the final letter grades) form a subset of the codomain. We call this subset the range
of the function g. The range of a function can be a proper subset of the codomain. Hence, the
codomain of a function is different from the set of its images. If the range of a function does
equal to the codomain, we say that the function is onto.

Example 6.1.2 For the nearest integer function h(x) = [x], the domain is R. The codomain
is Z, and the range is also Z. Hence, the nearest integer function is onto.

Example 6.1.3 Let x be a real number. The greatest integer function x returns the
greatest integer less than or equal to x. For example,

                -6.34 = -7, and  15 = 15.
       50 = 7,

Therefore, x returns x if it is an integer, otherwise, it rounds x down to the next closest

integer. Hence, it is also called the floor function of x. It is clear that its domain is R, and
the codomain and range are both Z.

Hands-On Exercise 6.1.1 Let x be a real number. The least integer function x returns
the least integer greater than or equal to x. For example,

                -6.34 = -6, and  15 = 15.
       50 = 8,

Thus, x returns x if it is an integer, otherwise, it rounds x up to the next closest integer.
Hence, it is also called the ceiling function of x. What is its domain and codomain?

    We impose two restrictions on the input-output relationships that we call functions. For
any fixed input value x, the output from a function must be the same every time we use the
function. As a machine, it spits out the same answer every time we feed the same value x to it.
As a calculator, it displays the same answer on its screen every time we enter the same value x,
and push the button for the function. We call the output value the image of x, and write f (x).
The first important requirement for a function f to be well-defined is: the image f (x) is unique
for any fixed x-value.

    A good machine must perform properly. In terms of a function f , we must be able to obtain
f (x) for any value x (and, of course, produce only one result for each x). This is perhaps a
little bit too demanding. A remedy is to restrict our attention to those x's over which f would
work. The set of legitimate input values is precisely what we call the domain of the function.
Consequently, the second requirement says: for every element x from the domain, the output
value f (x) should be well-defined. This is the mathematical way of saying that the value f (x)
can be obtained.

Example 6.1.4 Compare this to a calculator. If you enter a negative number and press the


     button, an error message will appear. To be able to compute the square root of a number,
the number must be nonnegative. The domain of a function is the set of acceptable input values
for which meaningful results can be found. For the square root function, the domain is R+  {0},
which is the set of nonnegative real numbers.

Hands-On Exercise 6.1.2 For the square root function, we may regard its codomain as R.
What is its range? Is the function onto?

Hands-On Exercise 6.1.3 For the square root function, can we say its domain is R+  0?
Explain.

    The two conditions for a function to be well-defined are often combined and written as if it   Every element in the
were only one condition:                                                                           domain has a unique

       A function f is well-defined if every element x from the domain has a unique image
       in the codomain.

When you examine this definition closer, you will find the two separate requirements:
    · every element in the domain has an image under f , and
    · the image is unique.

In the next section, we shall present the complete formal definition.

Summary and Review

    · A function is a rule that assigns to every element in the domain a unique image in the
       codomain.

6.2 Definition of Functions

Definition. Let A and B be nonempty sets. A function from A to B is a rule that assigns

to every element of A a unique element in B. We call A the domain, and B the codomain, of

the function. If the function is called f , we write f : A  B. Given x  A, its associated element

in B is called its image under f . We denote it f (x), which is pronounced as "f of x."

                          A function is sometimes called a map or mapping . Hence, we sometimes say f maps x to
                      its image f (x). Functions are also called transformations.

                      Example 6.2.1 The function f : {a, b, c}  {1, 3, 5, 9} is defined according to the rule

                                                      f (a) = 1, f (b) = 5, and f (c) = 9.

                      It is a well-defined function. The rule of assignment can be summarized in a table:

                                                                             x abc
                                                                           f (x) 1 5 9

                      We can also describe the assignment rule pictorially with an arrow diagram, as shown in
                      Figure 6.2.

produce a well-defined function from R to R? Explain.

Example 6.2.3  The function f : [0, )  R defined by
                                                        

                                              f (x) = x

is well-defined. So is the function g: [2, )  R defined as

Can you explain why the domain is [2, )?

Example 6.2.4 Let A denote the set of students taking Discrete Mathematics, and G =

{A, B, C, D, F }, and (x) is the final grade of student x in Discrete Mathematics. Every student
should receive a final grade, and the instructor has to report one and only one final grade for
each student. This is precisely what we call a function.

Example 6.2.5 The function n: ({a, b, c, d})  Z is defined as n(S) = |S|. It evaluates the
cardinality of a subset of {a, b, c, d}. For example,

                                             n {a, c} = n {b, d} = 2.

Note that n() = 0.

codomain involve                                  Z7 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and Z5 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4},
different moduli.
                       respectively. Not only are their elements different, their binary operations are different too. In
                       the domain Z7, the arithmetic is performed modulo 7, but the arithmetic in the codomain Z5 is
                       done modulo 5. So we need to be careful in describing the rule of assignment if a computation
                       is involved. We could say, for example,

                                                             f (x) = z, where z  3x (mod 5).

                       Consequently, starting with any element x in Z7, we consider x as an ordinary integer, multiply
                       by 3, and reduce the answer modulo 5 to obtain the image f (x). In other words, we can write

                                                                         f (x) = (3x) mod 5.

                       Here, "mod" is the binary operation that produces the remainder in an integer division. Hence,
                       we do not need to (and should not) enclose "mod 5" within a pair of parentheses. Alternatively,
                       it may be easier to use congruence to define f . For brevity, we shall write

                                                                        f (x)  3x (mod 5).

                       We summarize the images in the following table:

                                                                    n 0123456

                       Take note that the images start repeating after f (4) = 2.

                       Definition. The graph of a function f : A  B is the set of ordered pairs (x, y) from A × B

                       such that y = f (x).                                                   

                           The graph of a function, in this general definition, may not look like the kind of graphs we
                       expected from real functions. A graph is, by definition, a set of ordered pairs.
6.2 Definition of Functions                                                             187

Example 6.2.7 The graph of the function f in Example 6.2.6 is the set of ordered pairs

{(0, 0), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 0), (6, 3)}.

If one insists, we could display the graph of a function using an xy-plane that resembles the
usual Cartesian plane. Keep in mind: the elements x and y come from A and B, respectively.
We can "plot" the graph for f in Example 6.2.6 as shown below.

    Besides using a graphical representation, we can also use a (0, 1)-matrix. A (0, 1)-matrix is
a matrix whose entries are 0 and 1. For the function f , we use a 7 × 5 matrix, whose rows and
columns correspond to the elements of A and B, respectively, and put one in the (i, j)th entry
if j = f (i), and zero otherwise. The resulting matrix is

We call it the incidence matrix for the function f .

Summary and Review

    · A function f from a set A to a set B (called the domain and the codomain, respectively)
       is a rule that describes how a value in the codomain B is assigned to an element from the

       domain A.
    · But it is not just any rule; rather, the rule must assign to every element x in the domain

       a unique value in the codomain.
    · This unique value is called the image of x under the function f , and is denoted f (x).
188                                                   Chapter 6 Functions

     · We use the notation f : A  B to indicate that the name of the function is f , the domain

        is A, and the codomain is B.
     · The graph of a function f : A  B is the collection of all ordered pairs (x, y) from A × B

        such that y = f (x).
     · The graph of a function may not be a curve, as in the case of a real function. It can be

        just a collection of points.
     · We can also display the images of a function in a table, or represent the function with an

        incidence matrix.

6.3 One-to-One Functions

We distinguish two special families of functions: the one-to-one functions and the onto functions.
We shall discuss one-to-one functions in this section, and onto functions in the next.

Definition. A function f : A  B is said to be one-to-one if                                         To be one-to-one,
                                                                                                    distinct elements
                           x1 = x2  f (x1) = f (x2)                                                 must have distinct
                                                                                                    images.

for all elements x1, x2  A. A one-to-one function is also called an injection, and we call

a function injective if it is one-to-one. A function that is not one-to-one is referred to as

many-to-one .                                                                         

    Any well-defined function is either one-to-one or many-to-one. A function cannot be one-
to-many because no element can have multiple images. The difference between one-to-one and
                        190                                           Chapter 6 Functions

Use this definition to  many-to-one functions is whether there exist distinct elements that share the same image. There

is one-to-one.
                        Example 6.3.1 The identity function on any nonempty set A

                                                                     iA: A  A, iA(x) = x,

                        maps any element back to itself. It is clear that all identity functions are one-to-one.

                        Example 6.3.2 The function h: A  A defined by h(x) = c for some fixed element c  A, is
                        an example of a constant function. It is a function with only one image. This is the exact
                        opposite of an identity function. It is clearly not one-to-one unless |A| = 1.

                            For domains with a small number of elements, one can use inspection on the images to
                        determine if the function is one-to-one. This becomes impossible if the domain contains a larger
                        number of elements.

                            In practice, it is easier to use the contrapositive of the definition to test whether a function
                        is one-to-one:

                                                                     f (x1) = f (x2)  x1 = x2.

                        Example 6.3.3 Is the function f : R  R defined by f (x) = 3x + 2 one-to-one?

                        Solution: Assume f (x1) = f (x2), which means

                                                                          3x1 + 2 = 3x2 + 2.

                        Thus 3x1 = 3x2, which implies that x1 = x2. Therefore f is one-to-one.

                        Hands-On Exercise 6.3.1 Determine whether the function g: R  R defined by g(x) = 5-7x
                        is one-to-one.

                        Hands-On Exercise 6.3.2 Determine whether the function h: [2, )  R defined by h(x) =
                          x - 2 is one-to-one.

                            Interestingly, sometimes we can use calculus to determine if a real function is one-to-one. A
                        real function f is increasing if

                                           x1 < x2  f (x1) < f (x2),

                        and decreasing if

                                           x1 < x2  f (x1) > f (x2).

                        Obviously, both increasing and decreasing functions are one-to-one. From calculus, we know
                        that
6.3 One-to-One Functions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      191

    · A function is increasing over an open interval (a, b) if f (x) > 0 for all x  (a, b).
    · A function is decreasing over an open interval (a, b) if f (x) < 0 for all x  (a, b).

Therefore, if the derivative of a function is always positive, or always negative, then the function
must be one-to-one.

                                                                                 p(x) = 2x3 - 5

is one-to-one, because p (x) = 6x2 > 0 for any x  R. Likewise, the function q:                                                                                                                                                                       - 2 , 2  R
defined by

                                                      q(x) = tan x

is also one-to-one, because q (x) = sec2 x > 0 for any x  - 2 , 2 .

Hands-On Exercise 6.3.3 Use both methods to show that the function k: (0, )  R defined
by k(x) = ln x is one-to-one.

Example 6.3.5 The function h: R  R given by h(x) = x2 is not one-to-one because some of                                                                                                                                                                            You can use
its images are identical. For example, h(3) = h(-3) = 9. It is a many-to-one function. Likewise,                                                                                                                                                                   counterexamples to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   show that a function
the absolute value function |x| is not one-to-one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 is not one-to-one.
    The functions p: [ 0, )  R defined by p(x) = x2 and q: [ 0, )  R defined by q(x) = |x|

are one-to-one. Whether a function is one-to-one depends not only on its formula, but also on

its domain. Consequently, sometimes we may be able to convert a many-to-one function into a

one-to-one function by modifying its domain.

Example 6.3.6 Construct a one-to-one function from [ 1, 3 ] to [ 2, 5 ].

Solution: There are many possible solutions. In any event, start with a graph. We can use a
straight line graph. The domain [ 1, 3 ] lies on the x-axis, and the codomain [ 2, 5 ] lies on the
y-axis. Hence the graph should cover the boxed region in Figure 6.4.

                     To determine the formula for f , we need to derive the equation of the line. Take the first
                 graph as our choice. The line joins the point (1, 2) to the point (3, 4). Thus, its equation is

                                 y-2 4-2                        = 1.

                                 x-1 3-1

                 The last step is to write the answer in the form of f (x) = . . . . We have to express y in terms of
                 x. We find y = x + 1. Hence,

                                 f : [ 1, 3 ]  [ 2, 5 ], f (x) = x + 1

                 is an example of a one-to-one function from [1, 3] to [2, 5].

                 Hands-On Exercise 6.3.4 Construct a one-to-one function from [ 1, 3 ] to [ 2, 5 ] based on the
                 second graph in Example 6.3.6.

                 Hands-On Exercise 6.3.5 Construct a one-to-one function from [ 3, 8 ] to [ 2, 5 ].

                 Example 6.3.7   Determine whether the function g: Z43  Z43 defined by
                 is one-to-one.                       g(x)  11x - 5 (mod 43)

                 Solution: Assume g(x1) = g(x2). This means

                                 11x1 - 5  11x2 - 5 (mod 43),

                 which implies

                                 11x1  11x2 (mod 43).

                 Notice that 4 · 11 = 44  1 (mod 43), hence 11-1  4 (mod 43). Multiplying 4 to both sides of
                 the last congruence yields

                                                               44x1  44x2 (mod 43),

                 which is equivalent to, since 44  1 (mod 43),

                                 x1  x2 (mod 43).

                 Therefore, x1 = x2 in Z43. This proves that g is one-to-one.

Hands-On Exercise 6.3.6  Is the function h: Z15  Z15 defined by

a one-to-one function?

is not one-to-one by finding x1 = x2 such that k(x1) = k(x2).                                      You can use a
                                                                                                   counterexample to
                                                                                                   show that a function
                                                                                                   is not one-to-one.

Example 6.3.8 In the last hands-on exercise, we should not rely on the non-existence of 5-1
in Z15 to prove that k is not one-to-one. One must consider the interaction between the domain,
the codomain, and the definition of the function. For example, despite the fact that 5-1 does
not exist in Z15, the function p: Z3  Z15 defined by

                                             p(x)  5x - 11 (mod 15)

is one-to-one, because p(0) = 4, p(1) = 9, and p(2) = 14 are distinct images.

    The last example illustrates the trickiness in a function with different moduli in its domain
and codomain. Use caution when you deal with such functions! Sometimes, infinite sets also
pose a challenge. Because there is an infinite supply of elements, we may obtain results that
appear to be impossible for finite sets.

Example 6.3.9 The function f : Z  Z defined by

                          f (n) =  n  if n is even
                                   2

                                   n+1 2 if n is odd

is not one-to-one, because, for example, f (0) = f (-1) = 0. The function g: Z  Z defined by

                                   g(n) = 2n

is one-to-one, because if g(n1) = g(n2), then 2n1 = 2n2 implies that n1 = n2.

Hands-On Exercise 6.3.8 Show that the function h: Z  N defined by
                                           h(n) = 2n + 1 if n  0,
                                                        -2n if n < 0,

is one-to-one.

Example 6.3.10 Let A be the set of all married individuals from a monogamous community
who are neither divorced nor widowed. Then the function s: A  A defined by

                                                  s(x) = spouse of x

is one-to-one. The reason is, it is impossible to have x1 = x2 and yet s(x1) = s(x2).

Summary and Review

    · A function f is said to be one-to-one if f (x1) = f (x2)  x1 = x2.
    · No two images of a one-to-one function are the same.
    · To show that a function f is not one-to-one, all we need is to find two different x-values

       that produce the same image; that is, find x1 = x2 such that f (x1) = f (x2).

6.4 Onto Functions

One-to-one functions focus on the elements in the domain. We do not want any two of them
sharing a common image. Onto functions focus on the codomain. We want to know if it contains
elements not associated with any element in the domain.

Definition. A function f : A  B is onto if, for every element b  B, there exists an element
a  A such that

                                                        f (a) = b.

An onto function is also called a surjection, and we say it is surjective.               

Example 6.4.1 The graph of the piecewise-defined functions h: [1, 3]  [2, 5] defined by

                    h(x) = 3x - 1 if 1  x  2,
                                -3x + 11 if 2 < x  3,

is displayed on the left in Figure 6.5. It is clearly onto, because, given any y  [2, 5], we can find
at least one x  [1, 3] such that h(x) = y. Likewise, the function k: [1, 3]  [2, 5] defined by

                                                                                                           k(x) = 3x - 1 if 1  x  2,
                                                                                                           5  if 2 < x  3,

Remark. This is a challenging problem. Since the domain is an open interval, a straight line

graph does not work, because it will not cover every number in the codomain.                                                

Solution:   The    solution    is  based   on  the   observation          that  the  function  h:  (-     ,   2 )    R  defined
                                                                                                       2

by h(x) = tan x is one-to-one and onto. For this to work in this problem, we need to shift and

scale  the  interval  (5,  8)  to  the  same   size  as  (- 2   ,     ).
                                                                   2
First, we have to shift the center of the interval (5, 8) to the center of the interval (- 2 , 2 ).
                                               5+8       213 ,                           (- 2 ,  2 )
The  midpoint  of  the  interval   (5, 8)  is    2   =          and   the  midpoint  of               is  0.  Hence,    we  need

to shift the interval (5, 8) to the left       13    units.     This means we need to use the transformation
                                               2
x - 213 . The two endpoints 5 and 8 become - 32 and 32 , respectively:

                                                  x 5 132 8
                                               x - 132 - 32 0 32

After the transformation x - 213 , the original interval (5, 8) becomes the interval (- 32 , 32 ). Next,
we want to stretch the interval (- 32 , 32 ) into (- 2 , 2 ). This calls for a scaling factor of 3 .

                                                x                5 132 8
                                           3 x - 213            - 2 0 2

Putting these transformations together, we conclude that

                                                                           13
                                           g(x) = tan x -
                                                                3          2

gives a one-to-one and onto function from (5, 8) to R.

Hands-On Exercise 6.4.4 Construct a function h: (2, 9)  R that is both one-to-one and
onto.

    In general, how can we tell if a function f : A  B is onto? The key question is: given an
element y in the codomain, is it the image of some element x in the domain? If it is, we must
be able to find an element x in the domain such that f (x) = y. Mathematically, if the rule of
assignment is in the form of a computation, then we need to solve the equation y = f (x) for
x. If we can always express x in terms of y, and if the resulting x-value is in the domain, the
function is onto.

Example 6.4.3 Is the function p: R  R defined by p(x) = 3x2 - 4x + 5 onto?

Solution 1: Let y = 3x2 - 4x + 5, we want to know if we can always express x in terms of y.
Rearranging the equation, we find

                                               3x2 - 4x + (5 - y) = 0.

We want this equation to be solvable over R, that is, we want its solutions to be real. This
requires its discriminant to be nonnegative. So we need

                                      (-4)2 - 4 · 3 · (5 - y) = 12y - 44  0.

We have real solutions only when y  311 . This means, when y < 311 , we cannot find an x-value
such that p(x) = y. Therefore, p is not onto.

Solution 2: By completing the square, we find

                   p(x) = 3x2 - 4x + 5 = 3 x - 2 2 + 11  11 .
                                                               3     33

Since p(x) < 311 , it is clear that p is not onto.

Hands-On Exercise 6.4.5 The function g: R  R is defined as g(x) = 3x + 11. Prove that it
is onto.

Example 6.4.4 Is the function p: R  R defined by

an onto function?

Solution:  The graphs y = 4x + 1 and y =            1  x  are  both  increasing.  For x  3, the y-values
                                                    2
cover the range (-, 13), and for x > 3, the y-values cover the range 32 ,  . Since these two

y-ranges overlap, all the y-values are being covered by the images. Therefore, p is onto.

Example 6.4.5 Consider the function g: Z43  Z43 defined by

                                             g(x)  11x - 5 (mod 43).

Let
                                          y = g(x)  11x - 5 (mod 43),

then
                                    x  11-1(y + 5)  4(y + 5) (mod 43).

This shows that g is onto.

Summary and Review

    · A function f : A  B is onto if, for every element b  B, there exists an element a  A
       such that f (a) = b.

    · To show that f is an onto function, set y = f (x), and solve for x, or show that we can
       always express x in terms of y for any y  B.

    · To show that a function is not onto, all we need is to find an element y  B, and show
       that no x-value from A would satisfy f (x) = y.

6.5 Properties of Functions

In this section, we will study some properties of functions. To facilitate our discussion, we
need to introduce some notations. Some students may find them confusing and difficult to use.
Besides memorizing the definitions, try to understand what they really mean.

Definition. Given a function f : A  B, and C  A, the image of C under f is defined as

                             f (C) = {f (x) | x  C}.

In words, f (C) is the set of all the images of the elements of C.                  

Remark. A few remarks about the definition:

   1. It is about the image of a subset C of the domain of A. Do not confuse it with the image
       of an element x from A.

   2. Therefore, do not merely say "the image." Be specific: the image of an element, or the
       image of a subset.

   3. Better yet: include the notation f (x) or f (C) in the discussion.

   4. While f (x) is an element in the codomain, f (C) is a subset of the codomain.

   5. Perhaps, the most important thing to remember is:

If y  f (C), then y  B, and there exists an x  C such that f (x) = y.                           Remember this!

This key observation is often what we need to start a proof with.                   

Definition. Let f : A  B be a function. The image or range of f , denoted im f , is defined     The image or range
                                                                                                of a function.
as the set f (A). Hence, im f is the set of all possible images that f can assume.  

    The definition implies that a function f : A  B is onto if im f = B. Unfortunately, this
observation is of limited use, because it is not always easy to find im f .

Example 6.5.1 For the function f : R  R defined by
                                                        f (x) = x2,

we find im f = [0, ). We also have, for example, f [ 2, ) = [4, ). It is clear that f is
neither one-to-one nor onto.

Example 6.5.2 For the function g: Z  Z defined by

                                                      g(n) = n + 3,

we find im g = Z, and g(N) = {4, 5, 6, . . .}. The function g is both one-to-one and onto.

Hands-On Exercise 6.5.1 The function p: R  R is defined as p(x) = 3x + 11. Find p(R+)
and im p.
202                                                    Chapter 6 Functions

Hands-On Exercise 6.5.2 The function q: R  R is defined as q(x) = x2 - x - 7. Find im q.

Example 6.5.3 The function h: Z15  Z15 is defined by
                                            h(x)  5x - 11 (mod 15).

From the tabulated data
                                      x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 · · · 14

                                    f (x) 4 9 14 4 9 14 4 · · · 14

it becomes clear that the images repeat the pattern 4, 9, 14 five times. Therefore, we determine
that im h = {4, 9, 14}.

Hands-On Exercise 6.5.3 Determine h({0, 3, 4}), where h is defined in Example 6.5.3.

Example 6.5.4 Determine f ({(0, 2), (1, 3)}), where the function f : {0, 1, 2} × {0, 1, 2, 3}  Z
is defined according to

                                                     f (a, b) = a + b.

Remark: Strictly speaking, we should write f ((a, b)) because the argument is an ordered pair

of the form (a, b). However, we often write f (a, b), because f can be viewed as a two-variable

function. The first variable comes from {0, 1, 2}, the second comes from {0, 1, 2, 3}, and we add

them to form the image.                                                           

Solution: Because                                      f (1, 3) = 1 + 3 = 4,
                            f (0, 2) = 0 + 2 = 2, and

we determine that f ({(0, 2), (1, 3)}) = {2, 4}.

Hands-On Exercise 6.5.4 Find im f , where f is defined in Example 6.5.4.

    We are now ready to present the first collection of properties of functions.
Theorem 6.5.1 Given f : A  B, the following properties hold for any C1, C2  A.

      (a) f (C1  C2) = f (C1)  f (C2)
      (b) f (C1  C2)  f (C1)  f (C2)
      (c) f (C1 - C2)  f (C1) - f (C2)
      (d) C1  C2  f (C1)  f (C2)
6.5 Properties of Functions                                             203

Remark. These results provide excellent opportunities to learn how to write mathematical

proofs. We only provide the proof of (a) below, and leave the proofs of (b)-(d) as exercises. In

(a), we want to establish the equality of two sets. One way to prove that S = T is to show that

S  T , and T  S. Now, in order to prove that S  T , we need to show that z  S implies

z T; to show that T  S, we want to prove that z  T implies z  S.        

Proof of (a): First, we want to show that f (C1  C2)  f (C1)  f (C2). Let y  f (C1  C2),
then there exists x  C1  C2 such that f (x) = y. Having x  C1  C2 means either x  C1 or
x  C2, so we have to consider two cases.

    · If x  C1, then f (x)  f (C1).
    · If x  C2, then f (x)  f (C2).

Thus, y = f (x) belongs to either f (C1) or f (C2), which means y = f (x)  f (C1)  f (C2). This
proves that f (C1  C2)  f (C1)  f (C2).

    Next, we want to show that f (C1)  f (C2)  f (C1  C2). Let y  f (C1)  f (C2), then y
belongs to either f (C1) or f (C2).

    · If y  f (C1), then there exists x1  C1 such that f (x1) = y.
    · If y  f (C2), then there exists x2  C2 such that f (x2) = y.

These two possibilities together imply that there exists an element x belonging to either C1 or
C2, that is, x  C1  C2, such that f (x) = y. This means f (x)  f (C1  C2). This proves that
f (C1)  f (C2)  f (C1  C2). This concludes the proof of f (C1  C2) = f (C1)  f (C2).

Hands-On Exercise 6.5.5 Prove part (b) of Theorem 6.5.1.

Remark. Part (b) of Theorem 6.5.1 only gives a subset relationship. The reason is: having
y  f (C1) and y  f (C2) does not necessarily mean that y is the image of the same element.
Since f can be many-to-one, it is possible to have x1  C1 - C2 and x2  C2 - C1 such that
f (x1) = f (x2) = y. Consider f : {1, 2, 3}  {a, b} defined by

             f (1) = f (3) = a, and f (2) = b.

If C1 = {1, 2} and C2 = {2, 3}, then f (C1) = f (C2) = {a, b}, and

             f (C1  C2) = f ({2}) = {b}  {a, b} = f (C1)  f (C2).

Therefore, we can only conclude that y  f (C1  C2)  y  f (C1)  f (C2).  

Definition.  Given a function f : A  B, and D  B, the preimage of D under f is defined
as                                  f -1(D) = {x  A | f (x)  D}.

Hence, f -1(D) is the set of elements in the domain whose images are in C. The symbol f -1(D)

is also pronounced as "f inverse of D."                                 

Remark. Some remarks about the definition:
204                                                                Chapter 6 Functions

1. The preimage of D is a subset of the domain A.
2. In particular, the preimage of B is always A.
3. The key thing to remember is:

           If x  f -1(D), then x  A, and f (x)  D.

4. It is possible that f -1(D) =  for some subset D. If this happens, f is not onto.

5. Therefore, f is onto if and only if f -1({b}) =  for every b  B.                   

Example 6.5.5 If t: R  R is defined by t(x) = x2 - 5x + 5, find t-1({-1}).

Solution:  We want to find x such that t(x) = x2 - 5x + 5 = -1. Hence, we have to solve the
equation                            0 = x2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3).

The solutions are x = 2 and x = 3. Therefore, t-1({-1}) = {2, 3}.

Hands-On Exercise 6.5.6 If k: Q  R is defined by k(x) = x2 - x - 7, find k-1({3}).

Example 6.5.6 For the function f : {0, 1, 2} × {0, 1, 2, 3}  Z defined by

           f (a, b) = a + b,

we find

           f -1({3}) = {(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1)},
           f -1({4}) = {(1, 3), (2, 2)}.

Since preimages are sets, we need to write the answers in set notation.

Hands-On Exercise 6.5.7 Find h-1({4}) and h-1({2}), where the function h is defined in
Example 6.5.3.

Theorem 6.5.2 . Given f : A  B, and D1, D2  B, the following properties hold.
      (a) f -1(D1  D2) = f -1(D1)  f -1(D2)
      (b) f -1(D1  D2) = f -1(D1)  f -1(D2)
      (c) f -1(D1 - D2) = f -1(D1) - f -1(D2)
      (d) D1  D2  f -1(D1)  f -1(D2)

Proof of (a): First, we want to prove that f -1(D1  D2)  f -1(D1)  f -1(D2). Let x 
f -1(D1  D2), then f (x)  D1  D2. This means either f (x)  D1 or f (x)  D2.
6.5 Properties of Functions  205

    · If f (x)  D1, then x  f -1(D1).
    · If f (x)  D2, then x  f -1(D2).

Since x belongs to either f -1(D1) or f -1(D2), we determine that x  f -1(D1)  f -1(D2).
Therefore, f -1(D1  D2)  f -1(D1)  f -1(D2).

    Next, we want to prove that f -1(D1)f -1(D2)  f -1(D1D2). Let x  f -1(D1)f -1(D2).
Then x belongs to either f -1(D1) or x  f -1(D2).

    · If x  f -1(D1), then f (x)  D1.
    · If x  f -1(D2), then f (x)  D2.

Hence, f (x) belongs to either D1 or D2, which means f (x)  D1  D2. Thus, x  f -1(D1  D2).
We have proved that f -1(D1)  f -1(D2)  f -1(D1  D2). Together with f -1(D1  D2) 
f -1(D1)  f -1(D2), we conclude that f -1(D1  D2) = f -1(D1)  f -1(D2).

Hands-On Exercise 6.5.8 Prove part (b) of Theorem 6.5.2.

    Whether a function f : A  B is one-to-one or onto can be determined by the cardinality of
the preimages.

    · f is one-to-one if and only if |f -1({b})|  1 for every b  B.
    · f is onto if and only if |f -1({b})|  1 for every b  B.

If A and B are finite sets, then
    · |A|  |B| if f is one-to-one, and
    · |A|  |B| if f is onto.

In particular, if f is one-to-one and onto, we have |A| = |B|.

Example 6.5.7 A function f : Z14  Z10 cannot be one-to-one because in order for it to be
one-to-one, we need 14 distinct images. Since the codomain has only 10 elements, it is impossible
for it to come up with 14 different images.
                   206                                                    Chapter 6 Functions

Be sure you know       Likewise, a function g: Z23  Z57 cannot be onto because the domain has 23 elements, hence
which modulus you  we can have at most 23 different images. But the codomain has 57 elements; therefore, some of
are using.         its elements must be left unused.

                   Example 6.5.8 Consider the function h: Z23  Z57 defined by

                                                                  h(x)  43x (mod 57).

                   If y  43x (mod 57), then, since 43-1  4 (mod 57), we find, in Z23,
                                                                       x = 43-1y = 4y.

                   Since we can always express x in terms of y, we declare that f is onto. Yet, we have learned
                   from the previous example that f cannot be onto. Is there any contradiction?

                   Solution: There is an error in the argument. We should have said

                                                               x  43-1y  4y (mod 57).

                   Since x is reduced modulo 57, its value may exceed 23. If this happens, x / Z23. For example,
                   if y = 11, we would have x = 44 / Z23. Even if we reduce 44 modulo 23, we obtain x  21
                   (mod 23), we would have

                                                              43 · 21  48  11 (mod 57).
                   So it is still not the correct preimage. This example again illustrates the importance of taking
                   caution when a function involves different moduli in its domain and codomain.

Pronounce f -1 as  6.6 Inverse Functions
"f inverse."
                   A bijection is a function that is both one-to-one and onto. Naturally, if a function is a bijection,
                   we say that it is bijective. If a function f : A  B is a bijection, we can define another function
                   g that essentially reverses the assignment rule associated with f . Then, applying the function g
                   to any element y from the codomain B, we are able to obtain an element x from the domain A
                   such that f (x) = y. Let us refine this idea into a more concrete definition.

                   Definition. Let f : A  B be a bijective function. Its inverse function is the function
                   f -1: B  A with the property that

                                                                  f -1(b) = a  b = f (a).

                   The notation f -1 is pronounced as "f inverse." See Figure 6.6 for a pictorial view of an inverse
                   function.

                       Why is f -1: B  A a well-defined function? For it to be well-defined, every element b  B
                   must have a unique image. This means given any element b  B, we must be able to find one
                   and only one element a  A such that f (a) = b. Such an a exists, because f is onto, and there
                   is only one such element a because f is one-to-one. Therefore, f -1 is a well-defined function.

                       If a function f is defined by a computational rule, then the input value x and the output
                   value y are related by the equation y = f (x). In an inverse function, the role of the input and
                   output are switched. Therefore, we can find the inverse function f -1 by following these steps:

                     (i) Interchange the role of x and y in the equation y = f (x). That is, write x = f (y).
                     (ii) Solve for y. That is, express y in terms of x. The resulting expression is f -1(x).

Be sure to write the final answer in the form f -1(x) = . . . . Do not forget to include the domain
and the codomain, and describe them properly.

Example 6.6.1 To find the inverse function of f : R  R defined by f (x) = 2x + 1, we start
with the equation y = 2x + 1. Next, interchange x with y to obtain the new equation

                                                                                                                      x = 2y + 1.

Solving  for  y,  we  find  y  =  1  (x - 1).                           Therefore,                                         the   inverse                                                                                                                function                        is

It is important to describe the domain and the codomain, because they may not be the same as
the original function.

Example 6.6.2 The function s: - 2 , 2  [-1, 1] defined by s(x) = sin x is a bijection. Its
inverse function is

                               s-1: [-1, 1]  - 2 , 2 , s-1(x) = arcsin x.

The function arcsin x is also written as sin-1 x, which follows the same notation we use for
inverse functions.

                                                                                                                   
Hands-On Exercise 6.6.1 The function f : [-3, )  [ 0, ) is defined as f (x) = x + 3.

Hands-On Exercise 6.6.2 Find the inverse function of g: R  (0, ) defined by g(x) = ex.

Remark. Exercise caution with the notation. Assume the function f : Z  Z is a bijection.
The notation f -1(3) means the image of 3 under the inverse function f -1. If f -1(3) = 5, we
know that f (5) = 3. The notation f -1({3}) means the preimage of the set {3}. In this case, we
find f -1({3}) = {5}. The results are essentially the same if the function is bijective.
210                                                                        Chapter 6 Functions

    If a function g: Z  Z is many-to-one, then it does not have an inverse function. This makes
the notation g-1(3) meaningless. Nonetheless, the notation g-1({3}) is well-defined, because it

means the preimage of the set {3}. If g-1({3}) = {1, 2, 5}, we know that g(1) = g(2) = g(5) = 3.

If g-1({3}) = , we know that 3 / im g.

     In general, f -1(D) means the preimage of the subset D under the function f . Here, the

function f can be any function. If f is a bijection, then f -1(D) can also mean the image of the

subset D under the inverse function f -1. There is no confusion here, because the results are

the same.                                                                  

Example 6.6.3 The function f : R  R is defined as

                            f (x) = 3x                 if x  1,

                                             2x + 1 if x > 1.

Find its inverse function.

Solution: Since f is a piecewise-defined function, we expect its inverse function to be piecewise-
defined as well. First, we need to find the two ranges of input values in f -1. The images for

x  1 are y  3, and the images for x > 1 are y > 3. Hence, the codomain of f , which becomes
the domain of f -1, is split into two halves at 3. The inverse function should look like

                                             f -1(x) = ??? if x  3,
                                                            ??? if x > 3.

Next, we determine the formulas in the two ranges. We find

                            f -1(x) =        13 x          if x  3,
                                                           if x > 3.

The details are left to you as an exercise.

Hands-On Exercise 6.6.3 Find the inverse function of g: R  R defined by
                                            g(x) = 3x + 5 if x  6,
                                                         5x - 7 if x > 6.

Be sure you describe g-1 properly.

Example 6.6.4 The function g: Z10  Z10 is defined by g(x)  7x + 2 (mod 10). Find its
inverse function.

Solution: From x = g(y)  7y + 2 (mod 10), we obtain
                                     y  7-1(x - 2)  3(x - 2) (mod 10).

Hence, the inverse function g-1: Z10  Z10 is defined by g-1(x)  3(x - 2) (mod 10).

Hands-On Exercise 6.6.4 The function h: Z57  Z57 defined by h(x)  49x - 3 (mod 57).
Find its inverse function.

Example 6.6.5 Define h: Z10  Z10 according to h(x) = 2(x + 3) mod 10. Does h-1 exist?

Solution: Since 2-1 does not exist, we suspect the answer is no. In fact, h(x) is always even,
and it is easy to verify that im h = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}. Since h is not onto, h-1 does not exist.

Example 6.6.6  Find the inverse function of f : Z  N  {0} defined by

                                f (n) = 2n          if n  0,

                                         -2n - 1 if n < 0.

Solution: In an inverse function, the domain and the codomain are switched, so we have to

start with f -1: N  {0}  Z before we describe the formula that defines f -1. Writing n = f (m),

we find                         n = 2m         if m  0,

                                 -2m - 1 if m < 0.

We need to consider two cases.

(i) If n = 2m, then n is even, and m = n2 .
(ii) If n = -2m - 1, then n is odd, and m = - n+1 2 .

Therefore, the inverse function is defined by

               f -1: N  {0}  Z,          f -1(n) =     n        if n is even,
                                                       2        if n is odd.

                                                       - 2 n+1

Verify this with some numeric examples.

Hands-On Exercise 6.6.5  The function f : Z  N is defined as
Find its inverse.             f (n) = -2n if n < 0,
                                           2n + 1 if n  0.

    Let A and B be finite sets. If there exists a bijection f : A  B, then the elements of A and
B are in one-to-one correspondence via f . Hence, |A| = |B|. This idea provides the basis for

Example 6.6.7 Let A = {a1, a2, . . . , an} be an n-element sets. Recall that the power set (A)
contains all the subsets of A, and

                  {0, 1}n = {(b1, b2, . . . , bn) | bi  {0, 1} for each i, where 1  i  n}.

Define F : (A)  {0, 1}n according to F (S) = (x1, x2, . . . , xn), where

                                                 xi = 1 if ai  S,
                                                          0 if ai / S.

Simply put, F (S) is an ordered n-tuple whose ith entry is either 1 or 0, indicating whether S
contains the ith element of A (1 for yes, and 0 for no).

    It is clear that F is a bijection. For n = 8, we have, for example,

                                      F ({a2, a5, a8}) = (0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1),

and
                                  F -1 (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0) = {a1, a2, a6, a7}.

The function F defines a one-to-one correspondence between the subsets of A and the ordered
n-tuples in {0, 1}n. Since there are two choices for each entry in these ordered n-tuples, we have
2n such ordered n-tuples. This proves that |(A)| = 2n, that is, A has 2n subsets.

Hands-On Exercise 6.6.6 Consider the function F defined in Example 6.6.7. Assume n = 8.
Find F () and F -1 (1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0) .

Summary and Review

    · A bijection is a function that is both one-to-one and onto.
    · The inverse of a bijection f : A  B is the function f -1: B  A with the property that

                                                  f (x) = y  x = f -1(y).

    · In brief, an inverse function reverses the assignment rule of f . It starts with an element y
       in the codomain of f , and recovers the element x in the domain of f such that f (x) = y.

                                                                        .........................                                                                                                                               .........................                                                                                                                               ........................

                                                                           A                                                                                                                                                          B                                                                                                                                                       C

                                     Figure 6.8: Another pictorial view of a composite function.

                          The numeric value of (g  f )(x) can be computed in two steps. For example, to compute
                      (g f )(5), we first compute the value of f (5), and then the value of g(f (5)). To find the algebraic
                      description of (g  f )(x), we need to compute and simplify the formula for g(f (x)). In this case,
                      it is often easier to start from the "outside" function. More precisely, start with g, and write
                      the intermediate answer in terms of f (x), then substitute in the definition of f (x) and simplify
                      the result.

                      Example 6.7.1  Assume f, g: R  R are defined as f (x) = x2, and g(x) = 3x + 1. We find

                                             (g  f )(x) = g(f (x)) = 3[f (x)] + 1 = 3x2 + 1,
                                               (f  g)(x) = f (g(x)) = [g(x)]2 = (3x + 1)2.

                      Therefore,

                                                                           g  f : R  R,                                                                                                                                       (g  f )(x) = 3x2 + 1,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              (f  g)(x) = (3x + 1)2.
                                                                           f  g: R  R,

                      We note that, in general, f  g = g  f .

Hands-On Exercise 6.7.1 If p, q: R  R are defined as p(x) = 2x + 5, and q(x) = x2 + 1,
determine p  q and q  p. Do not forget to describe the domain and the codomain.

Hands-On Exercise 6.7.2 The functions f, g: Z12  Z12 are defined by
                   f (x)  7x + 2 (mod 12), and g(x)  5x - 3 (mod 12).

Compute the composite function f  g.

Example 6.7.2 Define f, g: R  R as
                                            f (x) = 3x + 1 if x < 0,
                                                         2x + 5 if x  0,

and g(x) = 5x - 7. Find g  f .

Solution: Since f is a piecewise-defined function, we expect the composite function g  f is also
a piecewise-defined function. It is defined by

(g  f )(x) = g(f (x)) = 5f (x) - 7 = 5(3x + 1) - 7 if x < 0,
                                                  5(2x + 5) - 7 if x  0.

After simplification, we find

                 g  f : R  R,  (g  f )(x) = 15x - 2 if x < 0,
                                                  10x + 18 if x  0.

In this example, it is rather obvious what the domain and codomain are. Nevertheless, it is
always a good practice to include them when we describe a function.

Hands-On Exercise 6.7.3 The functions f : R  R and g: R  R are defined by

                 f (x) = 3x + 2, and g(x) = x2                            if x  5,

                               2x - 1 if x > 5.

Determine f  g.
216                                                                 Chapter 6 Functions

    The next example further illustrates why it is often easier to start with the outside function
g in the derivation of the formula for g(f (x)).

Example 6.7.3 The function p: [1, 5]  R is defined by

                             p(x) = 2x + 3 if 1  x < 3,
                                         5x - 2 if 3  x  5;

and the function q: R  R by  q(x) = 4x if x < 7,
Describe the function q  p.              3x if x  7.

Solution: Since

                 (q  p)(x) = q(p(x)) = 4p(x) if p(x) < 7,
                                                 3p(x) if p(x)  7,

we have to find out when will p(x) < 7, and when will p(x)  7, because these conditions
determine what we need to do next to continue the computation. Since p(x) is computed in two
different ways, we have to analyze two cases.

     · Case 1: 1  x < 3. In this case, p(x) is defined as 2x + 3. This is an increasing function,
        hence
                      p(x)  p(1) = 2 · 1 + 3 = 5, and p(x) < p(3) = 2 · 3 + 3 = 9.

        For some x-values in this range, we have p(x) < 7, but for other x-values, we have p(x)  7.
        We need to know the cut-off point. This happens when p(x) = 2x + 3 = 7, that is, when
        x = 2. This leads to two subcases.

     - Case 1a: When 1  x < 2, we have p(x) = 2x + 3 < 7. Thus,

                             q(p(x)) = 4p(x) = 4(2x + 3) = 8x + 12.

           - Case 1b: When 2  x < 3, we have p(x) = 2x + 3  7. Thus,

                                             q(p(x)) = 3p(x) = 3(2x + 3) = 6x + 9.

     · Case 2: 3  x  5. In this case, p(x) is computed as 5x - 2. This is an increasing
        function, hence p(x)  p(3) = 5 · 3 - 2 = 13. Since p(x) is always greater than 7, we find

                                         q(p(x)) = 3p(x) = 3(5x - 2) = 15x - 6.

Combining these cases, we determine that the composite function q  p : [1, 5]  R is defined by

                 (q  p)(x) =  8x + 12  if 1  x < 2,
                              6x + 9   if 2  x < 3,
                              15x - 6  if 3  x  5.

Study this example again to make sure that you understand it thoroughly.

Hands-On Exercise 6.7.4 The functions f, g: Z  Z are defined by

     f (n) = n + 1 if n is even     g(n) = n + 3 if n is even
                 n - 1 if n is odd              n - 7 if n is odd

Determine g  f .

    Strictly speaking, g  f is well-defined if the codomain of f equals to the domain of g. It is
clear that g  f is still well-defined if im f is a subset of the domain of g. Hence, if

                                               f: A  B, g: C  D,

then g  f is well-defined if B  C, or more generally, im f  C.

Example 6.7.4 Let R denote the set of nonzero real numbers. Suppose

                  f : R  R,               f (x) = 1/x,
                  g: R  (0, ),            g(x) = 3x2 + 11.

Determine f  g and g  f . Be sure to specify their domains and codomains.

Solution: To compute f  g, we start with g, whose domain is R. Hence, R is the domain of
f  g. The result from g is a number in (0, ). The interval (0, ) contains positive numbers

only, so it is a subset of R. Therefore, we can continue our computation with f , and the final
result is a number in R. Hence, the codomain of f  g is R. The image is computed according
to f (g(x)) = 1/g(x) = 1/(3x2 + 11). We are now ready to present our answer:

                  f  g: R  R,                                  1
                                          (f  g)(x) = 3x2 + 11 .

In a similar manner, the composite function g  f : R  (0, ) is defined as

                                                 3
                                (g  f )(x) = x2 + 11.

Be sure you understand how we determine the domain and codomain of g  f .

Hands-On Exercise 6.7.5 Let Z denote the set of integers. Determine h  g, where

                                g: Z  R,  g(x) = |x|,
                                h: R  R,  h(x) = (x - 5)2.

Is g  h well-defined? Explain!

As usual, take extra caution with modular arithmetic.
218                                                               Chapter 6 Functions

Example 6.7.5 Define f : Z15  Z23 and g: Z23  Z32 according to

                               f (x)  3x + 5 (mod 23),
                               g(x)  2x + 1 (mod 32).

We may expect g  f : Z15  Z23 to be defined as                    (mod 32).
                              (g  f )(x)  2(3x + 5) + 1  6x + 11

In particular, (g  f )(8)  59  27 (mod 32).
    If we perform the computation one step at a time, we find f (8)  29  6 (mod 23), from

which we obtain
                                 (g  f )(8) = g(f (8)) = g(6)  13 (mod 32).

which is not what we have just found. Can you explain why?

Solution: The source of the problem is the different moduli used in f and g. The composite
function should be defined as

                   (g  f )(x)  2r + 1 (mod 32), where r  3x + 5 (mod 23).

In a way, this definition forces us to carry out the computation in two steps. Consequently, we
will obtain the correct answer (g  f )(8) = 13.

Remark. Some may regard the definition of g  f in the last example a bit confusing, but it
is an acceptable and commonly used practice. Recall that we can define the functions f and g
in the last example with the mod operation:

                               f (x) = (3x + 5) mod 23,
                               g(x) = (2x + 1) mod 32.

However, care must be taken to describe the composite function:

     (g  f )(x) = g(f (x))
                    = 2f (x) + 1 mod 32
                    = 2[(3x + 5) mod 23] + 1 mod 32.

This definition is more complex, but it reflects more accurately how the images should be

obtained. This example illustrates a dilemma in choosing the right notation: sometimes an

exact notation could be cumbersome to use, so we often opt for a more convenient (although

somewhat imprecise) notation.                                                

    There is a closed connection between a bijection and its inverse function, from the perspective
of composition.

Theorem 6.7.1 For a bijective function f : A  B,

                                    f -1  f = iA, and f  f -1 = iB,

where iA and iB denote the identity function on A and B, respectively.
Proof: To prove that f -1 f = iA, we need to show that (f -1 f )(a) = a for all a  A. Assume
f (a) = b. Then, because f -1 is the inverse function of f , we know that f -1(b) = a. Therefore,

                                    (f -1  f )(a) = f -1(f (a)) = f -1(b) = a,

which is what we want to show. The proof of f  f -1 = iB procceds in the exact same manner,
and is omitted here.

Example 6.7.6 Show that the functions f, g: R  R defined by f (x) = 2x + 1 and g(x) =
12 (x - 1) are inverse functions of each other.

Remark. The problem does not ask you to find the inverse function of f or the inverse function

of g. Instead, the answers are given to you already. You job is to verify that the answers are

indeed correct, that the functions are inverse functions of each other.                      

Solution: Form the two composite functions f  g and g  f , and check whether they both equal           To verify that g is

                                                                 2                                     f  g and g  f are
                                                                                                       identity functions.

      (b) If both f and g are one-to-one, then g  f is also one-to-one.
      (c) If both f and g are onto, then g  f is also onto.
      (d) If both f and g are bijective, then g  f is also bijective. In fact, (g  f )-1 = f -1  g-1.

Proof: (a) To show that f  iA = f , we need to show that (f  iA)(a) = f (a) for all a  A.
This follows from direct computation:

                                           (f  iA)(a) = f (iA(a)) = f (a).

The proofs of iB  f = f and (b)-(d) are left as exercises.

Example 6.7.7  The converses of (b) and (c) in Theorem 6.7.2 are false, as demonstrated in
the functions

                                f : Z  Z,       f (x) = 2x,
                                g: Z  Z,        g(x) = x/2 .

Here, g  f = iZ, so g  f is one-to-one, and it is obvious that f is also one-to-one, but g is not
one-to-one. It is easy to see that both g and g  f are onto, but f is not.

Summary and Review

    · The composition of two functions f : A  B and g: B  C is the function g  f : A  C
       defined by (g  f )(x) = g(f (x)).

    · If f : A  B is bijective, then f -1  f = iA and f  f -1 = iB.
    · To check whether f : A  B and g: B  A are inverse of each other, we need to show that

          - (g  f )(x) = g(f (x)) = x for all x  A, and
          - (f  g)(y) = f (g(y)) = y for all y  B.

Relations

7.1 Definition of Relations

Given two nonempty sets A and B, a function tells us how to obtain a unique element b  B
from any element a  A. Very often, we are only interested in some sort of relationship between
the elements from these two sets. A familiar example is the equality of two numbers. By saying
a = b, we are proclaiming that the two numbers a and b are related by being equal in value.
Likewise, a  b is another example of a relation.

Example 7.1.1 Given a, b  R, declare a and b to be related if they have the same sign. For
                                                                 

instance, 7.14 and e are related, so are - and - 2. However, 5 and -2 are not. Note that a
is related to b implies that b is also related to a.

Example 7.1.2 For a, b  R, define "a is related to b" if and only if a < b. Take note that        A relationship can be
                                                                                                  one-way only.
3 < 5, but 5  3. This demonstrates that a is related to b does not necessarily imply that b is
also related to a.                                                                                The two sets need
                                                                                                  not be the same.
Example 7.1.3 Let A be a set of students, and let B be a set of courses. Given a  A and
b  B, define "a is related to b" if and only if student a is taking course b. While it could be   A relation is a set of
possible that "John Smith is related to MATH 210" because John is taking MATH 210, it is          ordered pairs, we also
certainly absurd to say that "MATH 210 is related to John Smith," because it does not make        write a R b if a is
much sense to say that MATH 210 is taking John Smith. This again illustrates that a is related    related to b.
to b does not necessarily imply that b is also related to a.

    In these examples, we see that when we say "a is related to b," the order in which a and b
appear may make a difference. This suggests the following definition.

Definition. A relation from a set A to a set B is a subset of A × B. Hence, a relation R

consists of ordered pairs (a, b), where a  A and b  B. If (a, b)  R, we say that a is related

to b, and we also write a R b.                                  

Remark. We can also replace R by a symbol, especially when one is readily available. This is

exactly what we do in, for example, a < b. To say it is not true that a < b, we can write a  b.
Likewise, if (a, b) / R, then a is not related to b, and we could write a R b. But the slash may

not be easy to recognize when it is written over an uppercase letter. In this regard, it may be

a good practice to avoid using the slash notation over a letter. Alternatively, one may use the

"bar" notation a R b to indicate that a and b are not related.  

Example 7.1.4 Define R = {(a, b)  R2 | a < b}, hence (a, b)  R if and only if a < b.
Obviously, saying "a < b" is much clearer than "a R b." If a and b are not related, we could say

(a, b) / R, or a  b.
224                                                             Chapter 7 Relations

Example 7.1.5 Define

                                  F = (x, y)  R2 y = x2 1+ 1 .

Therefore, x is related to y if and only if y = x2+1 1 . We can also write

                                                   1
                                  F = x, x2 + 1 x  R ,

which may look a bit simpler.
    For instance, (1, 0.5)  F , but (1, 0)  F . In this case, (2, 0.2)  F is probably easier to

understand than 2 F 0.2. Likewise, (1, 2) / F may be easier to read than 1 F 2.

Hands-On Exercise 7.1.1 Define the relation H as {(x, x2 + 1) | x  R}. Determine whether
the following statements

                    2 H 3, (-4, 17) / H, 21 , 23 / H, (2, 3)  H, (1, 2)  H,

are true or false.

Hands-On Exercise 7.1.2 Let G = {(x, y)  R2 | xy = 1}. Is 2 related to 0.5? How would
you write it? Repeat with 4 and 0.5, and with 10 and 3.

Hands-On Exercise 7.1.3 In the last example, is 0 related to 3? How would you write it?
Repeat  with  1  and  -1.  Again  with  1    and  2.
                                          2

    Since a relation is a set, we can describe a relation by listing its elements (that is, using the
roster method).

Example 7.1.6 Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and B = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Define (a, b)  R if and only if
(a - b) mod 2 = 0. Then

          R = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 4)}.

We note that R consists of ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b have the same parity. Be cautious,
that 1  a  6 and 1  b  4. Hence, it is meaningless to talk about whether (1, 5)  R or
(1, 5) / R.

Hands-On Exercise 7.1.4 Let A = {2, 3, 4, 7} and B = {1, 2, 3, . . . , 12} - {7}. Define a S b if
and only if a | b. Use the roster method to describe S.
7.1 Definition of Relations                                                         225

    In the last example, 7 never appears as the first element (in the first coordinate) of any
ordered pair. Likewise, 1, 5, and 11 never appear as the second element (in the second coordinate)
of any ordered pair.

Definition. The domain of a relation R  A × B is defined as
                                 dom R = {a  A | (a, b)  R for some b  B},

and the image or range is defined as
                                  im R = {b  B | (a, b)  R for some a  A}.

Hands-On Exercise 7.1.5 Find dom S and im S, where S in Hands-On Exercise 7.1.4.

    A relation R  A × B can be displayed graphically on a digraph which is also called a
directed graph. Represent the elements from A and B by vertices or dots, and use directed
lines (also called directed edges or arcs) to connect two vertices if the corresponding elements
are related. Figure 7.1 displays a graphical representation of the relation in Example 7.1.6.

   Figure 7.1: The graphical representation of the a relation.

    Although a digraph gives us a clear and precise visual representation of a relation, it could
become very confusing and hard to read when the relation contains many ordered pairs. As
we will see in Section 7.4, we can sometimes simplify the digraphs in some special situations.
Otherwise, the graphical representation is only effective for relations with a small number of
ordered pairs.

    We can use a matrix representation to describe a relation. A matrix consists of values
arranged in rows and columns. A relation R from A = {a1, . . . , am} to B = {b1, . . . , bn} can be
described by an m-by-n matrix M = (mij) whose entry at row i and column j is defined by

                                               mij = 1 if ai R bj,
                                                          0 otherwise.

The matrix M is called the incidence matrix for R.

Example 7.1.7 The incidence matrix for the relation R in Example 7.1.6 is

Summary and Review

    · Relations are generalizations of functions. A relation merely states that the elements from
       two sets A and B are related in a certain way.

    · More formally, a relation is defined as a subset of A × B.
    · The domain of a relation is the set of elements in A that appear in the first coordinates

       of some ordered pairs, and the image or range is the set of elements in B that appear in

       the second coordinates of some ordered pairs.
    · For brevity and for clarity, we often write x R y if (x, y)  R.
    · Under this convention, the mathematical notations , , =, , and their like, can be

       regarded as relational operators.

7.2 Properties of Relations

If R is a relation from A to A, then R  A × A; we say that R is a relation on A.

Definition. A relation R on A is said to be
    · reflexive if (a, a)  R for all a  A,
    · irreflexive if (a, a) / R for all a  A,
    · symmetric if (a, b)  R  (b, a)  R for all a, b  A,
    · antisymmetric if [(a, b)  R  (b, a)  R]  a = b for all a, b  A,
    · transitive if [(a, b)  R  (b, c)  R]  (a, c)  R for all a, b, c  A.

These are important definitions, so let us repeat them using the relational notation a R b:
    · reflexive if a R a for all a  A,
228                                                                 Chapter 7 Relations

     · irreflexive if a R a (that is, a R a) for all a  A,

     · symmetric if a R b  b R a for all a, b  A,

     · antisymmetric if [(a R b)  (b R a)]  a = b for all a, b  A,

     · transitive if [(a R b)  (b R c)]  a R c for all a, b, c  A.                

Remark. A relation cannot be both reflexive and irreflexive. Hence, these two properties are
mutually exclusive. If it is reflexive, then it is not irreflexive. If it is irreflexive, then it cannot
be reflexive. Nonetheless, it is possible for a relation to be neither reflexive nor irreflexive. 

Remark. Many students find the concept of symmetry and antisymmetry confusing. Even
though the name may suggest so, antisymmetry is not the opposite of symmetry. It is possible
for a relation to be both symmetric and antisymmetric, and it is also possible for a relation to
be both non-symmetric and non-antisymmetric. A good way to understand antisymmetry is to
look at its contrapositive:

                                         a = b  (a, b)  R  (b, a)  R.

Thus, if two distinct elements a and b are related (not every pair of elements need to be related),

then either a is related to b, or b is related to a, but not both. Consequently, if we find distinct

elements a and b such that (a, b)  R and (b, a)  R, then R is not antisymmetric.  

Example 7.2.1 The empty relation is the subset . It is clearly irreflexive, hence not
reflexive. To check symmetry, we want to know whether a R b  b R a for all a, b  A. More
specifically, we want to know whether (a, b)    (b, a)  . Since (a, b)   is always false, the
implication is always true. Thus, the relation is symmetric. Likewise, it is antisymmetric and
transitive.

    The complete relation is the entire set A × A. It is clearly reflexive, hence not irreflexive.
It is also trivial that it is symmetric and transitive. It is not antisymmetric unless |A| = 1.

    The identity relation consists of ordered pairs of the form (a, a), where a  A. In other
words, a R b if and only if a = b. It is reflexive (hence not irreflexive), symmetric, antisymmetric,
and transitive.

Example 7.2.2 Consider the relation R on the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} defined by

                                      R = {(1, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)}.

    · Since (2, 2) / R, and (1, 1)  R, the relation is neither reflexive nor irreflexive.
    · We have (2, 3)  R but (3, 2) / R, thus R is not symmetric.
    · For any a = b, only one of the four possibilities (a, b) / R, (b, a) / R, (a, b)  R, or

       (b, a)  R can occur, so R is antisymmetric.
    · By going through all the ordered pairs in R, we verify that whenever (a, b)  R and

       (b, c)  R, we always have (a, c)  R as well. This shows that R is transitive.

Therefore, R is antisymmetric and transitive.

Example 7.2.3 Define the relation S on the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} according to

                                                  S = {(2, 3), (3, 2)}.

    · Since (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4) / S, the relation S is irreflexive, hence, it is not reflexive.
    · Since we have only two ordered pairs, and it is clear that whenever (a, b)  S, we also have

       (b, a)  S. Hence, S is symmetric.
    · We have both (2, 3)  S and (3, 2)  S, but 2 = 3. Hence, S is not antisymmetric.
    · Since (2, 3)  S and (3, 2)  S, but (2, 2) / S, the relation S is not transitive.

We conclude that S is irreflexive and symmetric.

Hands-On Exercise 7.2.1                   Define the relation R on the set R as
                                                        a R b  a  b.

Determine whether R is reflexive, irreflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, or transitive.

Hands-On Exercise 7.2.2                   The relation S on the set R is defined as
                                                       a S b  ab > 0.

Determine whether S is reflexive, irreflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, or transitive.

Example 7.2.4 Here are two examples from geometry. Let T be the set of triangles that can

be drawn on a plane. Define a relation S on T such that (T1, T2)  S if and only if the two
triangles are similar. It is easy to check that S is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

    Let L be the set of all the (straight) lines on a plane. Define a relation P on L according to
(L1, L2)  P if and only if L1 and L2 are parallel lines. Again, it is obvious that P is reflexive,
symmetric, and transitive.

Example 7.2.5 The relation T on R is defined as

                                                                     a
                                                         a T b  b  Q.

·  Since       a  = 1  Q,         the  relation  T   is  reflexive;   it  follows  that  T  is  not  irreflexive.
               a
·                                                               a                          m
   The   relation          T  is  symmetric,     because    if  b  can    be  written  as  n  for  some  integers  m  and  n,

   then  so       is  its  reciprocal     ba ,  because  b  =   nm .
· Since 2 T 18 and 18 T 2, yet 2 = 18, we conclude that T is not antisymmetric.a

· If  ba , cb      Q, then        a    =  m     and  b   =  p   for some nonzero integers m, n, p, and q.             Then
                                  b       n          c      q

   a  =  a     ·  b   =  mp    Q.      Hence,   T    is  transitive.
   c     b        c      nq

Therefore, the relation T is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

                                       a U b  a | b.

Determine whether U is reflexive, irreflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, or transitive.

Example 7.2.6 The relation U on Z is defined as
                                                  a U b  5 | (a + b).

    · The relation U is not reflexive, because 5 (1 + 1).
    · It is not irreflexive either, because 5 | (10 + 10).
    · If 5 | (a + b), it is obvious that 5 | (b + a) because a + b = b + a. Thus, U is symmetric.
    · We claim that U is not antisymmetric. For example, 5 | (2 + 3) and 5 | (3 + 2), yet 2 = 3.
    · It is not transitive either. For instance, 5 | (1 + 4) and 5 | (4 + 6), but 5 (1 + 6).
The relation U is symmetric.

Hands-On Exercise 7.2.5 Determine whether the following relation V on some universal set
U is reflexive, irreflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, or transitive:

7.2 Properties of Relations                                                      231

Example 7.2.7 Consider the relation V on the set A = {0, 1} is defined according to

                                                  V = {(0, 0), (1, 1)}.
    · The relation V is reflexive, because (0, 0)  V and (1, 1)  V . Hence, it is not irreflexive.
    · It is clearly symmetric, because (a, b)  V always implies (b, a)  V .
    · Indeed, whenever (a, b)  V , we must also have a = b, because V consists of only two

       ordered pairs, both of them are in the form of (a, a). It follows that V is also antisymmetric.
    · A similar argument shows that V is transitive.
The relation is reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, and transitive.

Hands-On Exercise 7.2.6 Determine whether the following relation W on a nonempty set of
individuals in a community is reflexive, irreflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, or transitive:

                                  a W b  a and b have the same last name.

Example 7.2.8 Define the relation W on a nonempty set of individuals in a community as

                                         a W b  a is a child of b.

· Nobody can be a child of himself or herself, hence W cannot be reflexive. Instead, it is
   irreflexive.

· It is obvious that W cannot be symmetric.
· It may sound weird from the definition that W is antisymmetric:

(a is a child of b)  (b is a child of a)  a = b,                                 (7.1)

   but it is true! The reason is, if a is a child of b, then b cannot be a child of a. This makes
   conjunction

                                     (a is a child of b)  (b is a child of a)

   false, which makes the implication (7.1) true.
· A similar argument holds if b is a child of a, and if neither a is a child of b nor b is a

   child of a. No matter what happens, the implication (7.1) is always true. Therefore, W is
   antisymmetric.
· It may help if we look at antisymmetry from a different angle. The contrapositive of the
   original definition asserts that when a = b, three things could happen:

(i) a and b are incomparable (a W b and b W a), that is, a and b are unrelated;

and if a and b are related, then either

(ii) a W b but b W a, or
(iii) b W a but a W b.
232  Chapter 7 Relations

       Using this observation, it is easy to see why W is antisymmetric.
    · It is clear that W is not transitive.

The relation is irreflexive and antisymmetric.

    Instead of using two rows of vertices in the digraph that represents a relation on a set A, we
can use just one set of vertices to represent the elements of A. A directed line connects vertex
a to vertex b if and only if the element a is related to the element b. If b is also related to a, the
two vertices will be joined by two directed lines, one in each direction. If a is related to itself,
there is a loop around the vertex representing a. See Problem 10 in Exercises 7.1.

    From the graphical representation, we determine that the relation R is

    · Reflexive if there is a loop at every vertex of G.

    · Irreflexive if G is loopless.

    · Symmetric if every pair of vertices is connected by none or exactly two directed lines in
       opposite directions.

    · Antisymmetric if every pair of vertices is connected by none or exactly one directed line.

    · Transitive if for every unidirectional path joining three vertices a, b, c, in that order, there
       is also a directed line joining a to c.

The incidence matrix M = (mij) for a relation on A is a square matrix. We find that R is
    · Reflexive if every entry on the main diagonal of M is 1.

    · Irreflexive if every entry on the main diagonal of M is 0.

    · Symmetric if M is symmetric, that is, mij = mji whenever i = j.

    · Antisymmetric if i = j implies that at least one of mij and mji is zero, that is, mijmji = 0.

    · Transitive if (M 2)ij > 0 implies mij > 0 whenever i = j.

For instance, the incidence matrix for the identity relation consists of 1s on the main diagonal,
and 0s everywhere else. This is called the identity matrix. If a relation R on A is both symmetric
and antisymmetric, its off-diagonal entries are all zeros, so it is a subset of the identity relation.

    It is an interesting exercise to prove the test for transitivity. Apply it to Example 7.2.2 to
see how it works.

Summary and Review

    · A relation from a set A to itself is called a relation on A.
    · Given any relation R on a set A, we are interested in five properties that R may or may

       not have.
    · The relation R is said to be reflexive if every element is related to itself, that is, if x R x

       for every x  A.
    · The relation R is said to be irreflexive if no element is related to itself, that is, if x R x for

       every x  A.
    · The reflexive property and the irreflexive property are mutually exclusive, and it is possible

       for a relation to be neither reflexive nor irreflexive.
    · The relation R is said to be symmetric if the relation can go in both directions, that is, if

       x R y implies y R x for any x, y  A.
    · The relation R is said to be antisymmetric if given any two distinct elements x and y,

       either (i) x and y are not related in any way, or (ii) if x and y are related, they can only
       be related in one direction.
    · A compact way to define antisymmetry is: if x R y and y R x, then we must have x = y.
    · Finally, a relation is said to be transitive if we can pass along the relation and relate two
       elements if they are related via a third element.
    · More precisely, R is transitive if x R y and y R z implies that x R z.

7.3 Equivalence Relations

Definition. A relation on a set A is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric,

and transitive. We often use the tilde notation a  b to denote an equivalence relation.  

Example 7.3.1 The relations in Examples 7.2.4, 7.2.5, and 7.2.7, are equivalence relations,
so are those in Hands-On Exercises 7.2.2 and 7.2.6.

Example 7.3.2 Define a relation  on Z by
                                              a  b  a  b (mod 4).

Verify that  is an equivalence relation.

Solution: We need to check three properties:
    · It is obvious a  a (mod 4), hence a  a. The relation  is reflexive.
    · If a  b, then a  b (mod 4). It is clear that we also have b  a (mod 4). Hence,  is
       symmetric.
    · If a  b and b  c, then

                                    a  b (mod 4), and b  c (mod 4).

       It follows that a  c (mod 4). Thus, a  c. This shows that  is transitive.

Therefore,  is an equivalence relation.

                                a  b  a  b (mod 6).

divided by 4 are related to each other. Define the sets

[0] = {n  Z | n mod 4 = 0} =                               4Z,

[1] = {n  Z | n mod 4 = 1} = 1 + 4Z,

[2] = {n  Z | n mod 4 = 2} = 2 + 4Z,

[3] = {n  Z | n mod 4 = 3} = 3 + 4Z.

It is clear that every integer belongs to exactly one of these four sets. Hence,

                                                Z = [0]  [1]  [2]  [3].

These four sets are pairwise disjoint, so Z is a disjoint union of these four sets. We say that
{[0], [1], [2], [3]} is a partition of Z.

Definition. A collection {S1, S2, . . . , Sn} of nonempty subsets of S is said to be a partition
of S if the subsets S1, S2, . . . , Sn are pairwise disjoint (Si  Sj =  whenever i = j), and

                           S1  S2  · · ·  Sn = S.

The subsets S1, S2, . . . , Sn are called the parts or components of the partition.  

    Because of transitivity and symmetry, all the elements related to a fixed element must be             If you know one
related to each other. Thus, if we know one element in the group, we essentially know all its             member in the gang,
"relatives."                                                                                              you know them all!

Definition. Let  be an equivalence relation on A. The set

                           [a] = {x  A | x  a}.

is called the equivalence class of a.                                                

Example 7.3.3 In Example 7.2.4, each equivalence class of the relation S consists of all the
triangles that are similar. Note that no triangle can belong to two different equivalence classes.
This means that the equivalence classes are pairwise disjoint.

    In the same example, each equivalence class of the relation P consists of all the lines that
are parallel. Again, take note that no line can belong to two different equivalence classes. Thus,
the equivalence classes are pairwise disjoint.

Example 7.3.4 For the relation  on Z defined by a  b  a  b (mod 4), there are
four equivalence classes [0], [1], [2] and [3], and the set {[0], [1], [2], [3]} forms a partition of Z.
Therefore,

                                                Z = [0]  [1]  [2]  [3],

and the four components [0], [1], [2] and [3] are pairwise disjoint.

                        Hands-On Exercise 7.3.5 For each of the equivalence relations mentioned in Example 7.3.1,
                        determine its equivalence classes.

                            All the elements in the same equivalence class are related to each other. Therefore, the
                        elements in [a] all share the same property that a enjoys, from the viewpoint of the relation
                        . In Example 7.3.4, the equivalence class [0] consists of elements that are multiples of 4. The
                        equivalence class [1] consists of elements that, when divided by 4, leave 1 as the remainder,
                        and similarly for the equivalence classes [2] and [3]. Because of the common bond between the
                        elements in an equivalence class [a], all these elements can be represented by any member within
                        the equivalence class. This is the spirit behind the next theorem.

                        Theorem 7.3.1 If  is an equivalence relation on A, then a  b  [a] = [b].

                        Proof: We leave the proof as an exercise.

Every element in an         One may regard equivalence classes as objects with many aliases. Every element in an

                        different equivalence classes to be distinct when in reality they may be identical.

                        Example 7.3.5 Define  on a set of individuals in a community according to

                                                          a  b  a and b have the same last name.

                        We have seen that  is an equivalence relation. Each equivalence class consists of all the
                        individuals with the same last name in the community. Hence, for example, James Smith, Lucy
                        Smith, and Peter Smith all belong to the same equivalence class. Any Smith can serve as its
                        representative, so we can denote it as, for example, [Peter Smith].

                        Example 7.3.6 Define  on R+ according to

                                                                         x  y  x - y  Z.

                        Hence, two real numbers are related if and only if they have the same decimal parts. It is easy to
                        verify that  is an equivalence relation, and each equivalence class [x] consists of all the positive
                        real numbers having the same decimal parts as x has. Notice that

                             R+ =  [x],

                                   x(0,1]

                        which means that the equivalence classes [x], where x  (0, 1], form a partition of R.

    What makes equivalence relations so important is the following Fundamental Theorem
on Equivalence Relations.

Theorem 7.3.2 Given any equivalence relation on a nonempty set A, the set of equivalence
classes forms a partition of A. Conversely, any partition {A1, A2, . . . , An} of a nonempty set A
into a finite number of nonempty subsets induces an equivalence relation  on A, where a  b
if and only if a, b  Ai for some i (thus a and b belong to the same component).

Proof: It is clear that A is the union of the equivalence classes induced by , so it remains to
show that these equivalence classes are pairwise disjoint. Assume [a]  [b] = . Let x  [a]  [b].
Then x  [a] and x  [b]. Having x  [a] means x  a, and x  [b] implies that x  b. Symmetry
and transitivity imply that a  b. Theorem 7.3.1 assures that [a] = [b]. Therefore, if [a] = [b],
then [a]  [b] = . This proves that the equivalence classes form a partition of A.

    Let A = A1  A2  · · ·  An be a partition of A, define the relation  on A according to

                                           x  y  x, y  Ai for some i.

It follows immediately from the definition that x  x, so the relation is reflexive. It is also clear
that x  y implies y  x, hence the relation is symmetric. Finally, if x  y and y  z, then
x, y  Ai for some i, and y, z  Aj for some j. Since the Ais form a partition of A, the element
y cannot belong to two distinct components. This means i = j, hence x, z  Ai. This proves
that  is transitive. Consequently,  is an equivalence relation.

    The idea behind the theorem is rather simple. Each equivalence class consists of all the
"relatives" from the same family, so obviously the set A can be divided into families (equivalence
classes). These families do not share any common elements (hence pairwise disjoint), because
Theorem 7.3.1 states that any two equivalence classes sharing some common elements must be
identical. Therefore, the families form a partition of A. Conversely, given a partition P, we could
define a relation that relates all members in the same component. This relation turns out to
be an equivalence relation, with each component forming an equivalence class. This equivalence
relation is referred to as the equivalence relation induced by P.

Example 7.3.7 In Example 7.2.4, the relation S is an equivalence relation, and the equivalence
classes are the sets of similar triangles, which form a partition of the set T . This means any
triangle belongs to one and only one equivalence class. In other words, we can classify the
triangles on a plane according to their three interior angles.

    The relation P in the same example is also an equivalence relation. Its equivalence classes
are the sets of lines that are parallel. Every line on the plane belongs to exactly one equivalence
class. Consequently, we can classify the lines on a plane by their slopes.

Example 7.3.8  Over Z, define
                           R3 = {(m, n) | m, n  Z and mn > 0}.
                        238                                                                     Chapter 7 Relations

                        It is not difficult to verify that R3 is an equivalence relation. There are only two equivalence
                        classes: [1] and [-1], where [1] contains all the positive integers, and [-1] all the negative
                        integers. It is obvious that Z = [1]  [-1].

As a line is the union  Example 7.3.9 For each b  R, define Lb to be the line in R2 (which is also called the xy-
of infinitely many      plane) with equation y = 2x + b. Then L = {Lb | b  R} is a partition of R2 because given
points, a plane is the  any point on R2, there is only one straight line with slope 2 that can pass through it. Such a
union of infinitely     partition induces an equivalence relation  defined by
many parallel lines.

                                         (p, q)  (s, t)  both (p, q) and (s, t) lie on Lb for some b.

                        Thus, (p, q)  (s, t) if and only if the two points (p, q) and (s, t) lie on the same straight line of

                        slope  2.  This  means  q-t  =  2.  Therefore,  we   can  restate  the  definition  as
                                                p-s

                                                            (p, q)  (s, t)  q - t = 2(p - s).

                        For example, (1, 5)  (0, 3). In fact, [(1, 5)] corresponds to the line y = 2x + 3 or L3. Similarly,
                        [(1, 1.25)] corresponds to the line y = 2x - 0.75 or L-0.75. In general, Lb = [(0, b)].

                        Hands-On Exercise 7.3.8 Consider the partition of R2 (the xy-plane)

                                                                              R2 = Lb,

                        induced by this partition.

                            We have studied modular arithmetic extensively. In Hands-On Exercise 7.3.2, you have
                        already proved the following result.

                        Theorem 7.3.3 For any positive integer n  2, the relation congruence modulo n is an equiv-
                        alence relation on Z.

                            We can now provide a more rigorous definition of Zn.

                        Definition. Let n  2 be an integer. The equivalence classes [0], [1], . . . , [n - 1] of the relation
                        congruence modulo n are called the residue classes modulo n. The set

                                                            Zn = [0], [1], . . . , [n - 1]

                        is called the set of residue classes modulo n.                                           

                        Remark. We define two operations  and                on the elements of Zn according to
                                                        [a]  [b] = [a + b],  and [a] [b] = [ab].

                        We will not go into the details, but we would like to remark that Zn, , forms an algebraic
                        structure called ring. In practice, we seldom write Zn = [0], [1], . . . , [n - 1] because it is too

cumbersome. Instead, we just write Zn = {0, 1, 2, . . . , n - 1}. However, what we really work

with in Zn are the residue classes represented by the integers 0 through n - 1.                                 

    The incidence matrix of an equivalence relation exhibits a beautiful pattern. Conversely, by
examining the incidence matrix of a relation, we can tell whether the relation is an equivalence
relation.

    If we can rearrange the rows and columns of an incidence matrix so that the modified
incidence matrix can be divided into blocks of submatrices containing entirely 1s or entirely 0s,
such that the 1-submatrices lie on the diagonal, then the underlying relation R is an equivalence
relation. Here is the reason. Since the entries in each 1-submatrix are all 1s, this means the
corresponding elements are all related to each other. This is the notion of transitivity. Obviously,
every element is related to itself. Since the 1-submatrices lie on the diagonal, the matrix, hence
the relation, is symmetric. This proves that the underlying relation is an equivalence relation.
Each equivalence class consists of all the elements that correspond to the row and columns in
the same 1-matrix.

Example 7.3.10 Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and define the relation R1 on A by

R1 = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 5)}.

It is clear from the incidence matrix (we add lines to make the 0- and 1-submatrices more
outstanding)

{1, 2, 3}, and [4] = [5] = {4, 5}, such that A = [1]  [4].

Example 7.3.11 Let A = {a, b, c, d}. Define the relation R2 on A by

   R2 = {(a, a), (a, c), (b, b), (b, d), (c, a), (c, c), (d, b), (d, d)}.

d    0101                                           d    0011

it becomes clear that R2 is an equivalence relation, with [a] = [c] = {a, c}, and [b] = [d] = {b, d},
such that A = [a]  [b].

Hands-On Exercise 7.3.9 The relation S defined on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is known to be

Show that S is an equivalence relation by studying its incidence matrix, and rewriting it if
necessary. Determine the contents of its equivalence classes.

Example 7.3.12 Find the equivalence relation R induced by the partition

                            P = {1}, {3}, {2, 4, 5, 6}

of A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Solution: From the two 1-element equivalence classes {1} and {3}, we find two ordered pairs
(1, 1) and (3, 3) that belong to R. From the equivalence class {2, 4, 5, 6}, any pair of elements
produce an ordered pair that belongs to R. Therefore,

     R = {(1, 1), (3, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6),

Summary and Review

    · A relation R on a set A is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
    · If R is an equivalence relation on the set A, its equivalence classes form a partition of A.
    · In each equivalence class, all the elements are related and every element in A belongs to

       one and only one equivalence class.
    · The relation R determines the membership in each equivalence class, and every element

       in the equivalence class can be used to represent that equivalence class.
    · In a sense, if you know one member within an equivalence class, you also know all the

       other elements in the equivalence class because they are all related according to R.
    · Conversely, given a partition of A, we can use it to define an equivalence relation by

       declaring two elements to be related if they belong to the same component in the partition.

7.4 Partial and Total Ordering

Two special relations occur frequently in mathematics. Both have to do with some sort of
ordering of the elements in a set. A branch of mathematics is devoted to their study. As you
can tell from the brief discussion in this section, they cover many familiar concepts.

Definition. A relation on a nonempty set A is called a partial ordering or a partial-order
relation if it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. We often use to denote a partial
ordering, and called (A, ) a partially ordered set or a poset.

Example 7.4.1 The usual "less than or equal to" relation on R, denoted , is a perfect
example of partial ordering. In fact, this is the reason why we adopt the notation , as it
reflects the similarities between the two symbols.

Example 7.4.2 Another classic example of partial ordering is the subset relation, denoted ,
on (S), where S is any set of elements. Observe that S can be empty, in which case () = {},
and ((), ) is obviously a partially ordered set.

Example 7.4.3 Another standard example of poset is (N, |). It is easy to verify that the
"divides" relation over the natural numbers is a partial ordering. Can you explain why (Z, |)
is not a poset?

Hands-On Exercise 7.4.1 Find a counterexample to illustrate why the "divides" relation,
denoted | , over Z is not antisymmetric. Is the "divides" relation reflexive over Z? How about
transitivity?

Hands-On Exercise 7.4.2 Define the relation on ({a, b, c, d}) according to
                                               S T  S  T  {a}.

Is (({a, b, c, d}, ) a poset? Which properties it does not possess? Explain.
7.4 Partial and Total Ordering                                   243

    Obviously, if a b but a = b, then we can write a  b. We sometimes say a precedes b, or
b succeeds a. We also say a is the predecessor of b, or b is the successor of a.

    The digraph for a poset can be simplified. Since a is always related to a itself, it is redundant
to draw a loop around every vertex. Since a b and b c always imply that a c, there is
no need to include the arc (directed edge) from a to c. So we follow the convention that we
only draw an arc from a to b if a  b and there does not exist another element t such that
a  t and t  b. Lastly, if a  b, we can place b above a so that all the arcs are pointing
upward. This suggests that we can use undirected lines to make the graph easier to read. All
these modifications lead to a much simpler graphical representation called a Hasse diagram.

Example 7.4.4 It is clear that ({1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}, |) is a poset. Its Hasse diagram is displayed
below.

                                12

                                    dd
                                        d

4                                                 6

   dd                                                dd
       d                                                 d

            2                                                 3

                                    dd
                                        d

                                             1

In this convention of using undirected line, the  relation (hence the ordering of the elements)
is read from the bottom up.

Hands-On Exercise 7.4.3 Draw the Hasse diagram for the poset ({1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36}, |).

    The definition of a poset does not require every pair of distinct elements to be comparable.
This means there may exist a = b such that a b and b a. An example can be found in the
numbers 2 and 3 in Example 7.4.4. If a partial ordering has the additional property that for
any two distinct elements a and b, either a  b or b  a (hence any pair of distinct elements are
comparable), we call the relation a total ordering .

Example 7.4.5 The poset (N, ) is a totally ordered set. The poset ({1, 5, 25, 125}, |) is also
a totally ordered set. Its Hasse diagram is shown below.

It is clear that the Hasse diagram of any totally ordered set will look like the one displayed
above. Consequently, a total ordering is also called a linear ordering . A totally ordered set is
also called a chain.

Hands-On Exercise 7.4.4 Construct the Hasse diagram for the poset ({1, 2, 4, 18, 16}, |). Is
it a totally ordered set?

Hands-On Exercise 7.4.5 Construct the Hasse diagram for the poset (({a, b, c}), ).

Combinatorics

8.1 What is Combinatorics?

Combinatorics studies the arrangements of objects according to some rules. The questions that
can be asked include

    · Existence. Do the arrangements exist?
    · Classification. If the arrangements exist, how can we characterize and classify them?
    · Enumeration. How many arrangements are there?
    · Construction. Is there an algorithm for constructing all the arrangements?

Example 8.1.1 In how many ways can five people be seated at a round table? What if a
certain pair of them refuses to sit next to one another? What if there are n people?

Example 8.1.2 Given integers n1  n2  · · ·  nt  1, a Young tableau of the shape

(n1, n2, . . . , nt) consists of t rows of left-justified cells, with ni cells in the ith row (counting from
the top row). These cells are occupied by the integers 1 through n, where n = n1 + n2 + · · · + nt,
such that the entries are in descending order across each row from left to right, and down each
column from top to bottom. For instance, the three Young tableaux of the shape (3, 1) are
depicted in Figure 8.1.

                        Figure 8.1: The three Young tableaux of the shape (3, 1).

It is known that there are 35 Young tableaux of the shape (4, 2, 1). Can you list all of them?
In general, one may ask, how many Young tableaux are there of shape (n1, n2, . . . , nt), and how
can we generate all of them?

Example 8.1.3 A binary string is a sequence of digits, each of which being 0 or 1. Let an
be the number of binary strings of length n that do not contain consecutive 1s. It is easy to
check that a1 = 2, a2 = 3, and a3 = 5. What is the general formula for an?

Example 8.1.4 The complexity of an algorithm tells us how many operations it requires. By
comparing the complexity of several algorithms for solving the same problem, we can determine
which one is the most efficient. Let bn be the number of operations required to solve a problem
of size n. If it is known that

                                          bn = 2bn-1 + 3bn-2, n  3,

where b1 = 1 and b2 = 3, what is the general formula for bn?

                     8.2 Addition and Multiplication Principles

                     Recall that the cardinality of a finite set A, denoted |A|, is the number of elements it contains.

                     Example 8.2.1 If A = {-1, 0, 2}, then |A| = 3. Also,
                                                                                   |{2}| = 1,

                                                                      |{2, 5, -1, -3}| = 4,
                                                                  |{x  R | x2 = 1}| = 2.
                     Notice that || = 0, because an empty set does not contain any element.

                         It becomes more interesting when we consider the cardinality of a union or an intersection
                     of two or more sets.

                     Example 8.2.2 Determine |A  B| and |A  B| if A = {2, 5} and B = {7, 9, 10}.

                     Solution: Since A  B = {2, 5, 7, 9, 10}, and A  B = , it is clear that |A  B| = 5, and
                     |A  B| = 0.

                     Example 8.2.3 Determine |A  B| and |A  B| if A = {2, 5} and B = {5, 9, 10}.

                     Solution: Since A  B = {2, 5, 9, 10}, and A  B = {5}, it is clear that |A  B| = 4, and
                     |A  B| = 1.

                     Hands-On Exercise 8.2.1 Let A = {n  Z | -5  n  3}, and B = {n  Z | -3  n  5}.
                     Evaluate |A  B| and |A  B|.

Use the addition         The difference between the last two examples is whether the two sets A and B have a
principle only when  nonempty intersection. Two sets A and B are disjoint if A  B = . A collection of
the sets do not      sets A1, A2, . . . , An is said to be pairwise disjoint if Ai  Aj =  whenever i = j. When
overlap.             A1, A2, . . . , An are pairwise disjoint, their union is called a disjoint union.

Watch for double     Example 8.2.4 Let A = {1, 0, -1}, B = {-2, 0, 2}, C = {-2, 2} and D = {3, 4, 5}. Then A,
counting!            C, and D are pairwise disjoint, so are B and D, but A, B, and C are not.

                     Theorem 8.2.1 (Addition Principle) If the finite sets A1, A2, . . . , An are pairwise disjoint,
                     then

                                                    |A1  A2  · · ·  An| = |A1| + |A2| + · · · + |An|.

                         Use the addition principle if we can break down the problems into cases, and count how many
                     items or choices we have in each case. The total number is the sum of these individual counts.
                     The idea is, instead of counting a large set, we divide it up into several smaller subsets, and
                     count the size of each of them. The cardinality of the original set is the sum of the cardinalities
                     of the smaller subsets. This divide-and-conquer approach works perfectly only when the sets
                     are pairwise disjoint.

                     Example 8.2.5 To find the number of students present at a lecture, the teacher counts how
                     many students there are in each row, then adds up the numbers to obtain the total count.

                         When the sets are not disjoint, the addition principle does not give us the right answer
                     because the elements belonging to the intersection are counted more than once. We have to
                     compensate the over-counting by subtracting the number of times these elements are over-
                     counted. The simplest case covers two sets.

Theorem 8.2.2 (Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE)) For any finite sets A and B,              In general, use PIE to
we have                                                                                          find the cardinality of
                                                                                                 a union of sets.
                                          |A  B| = |A| + |B| - |A  B|.

Proof: Observe that A  B is the disjoint union of three sets

                                     A  B = (A - B)  (A  B)  (B - A).

It is clear that |A - B| = |A| - |A  B|, and |B - A| = |B| - |A  B|. Therefore,

                         |A  B| = |A - B| + |A  B| + |B - A|
                                      = (|A| - |A  B|) + |A  B| + (|B| - |A  B|)
                                      = |A| + |B| - |A  B|,

which is what we have to prove.

    The principle of inclusion-exclusion also works if A and B are disjoint, because in such an
event, |A  B| = 0, reducing PIE to the addition principle.

Example 8.2.6 Assume the current enrollment at a college is 4689, with 60 students taking
MATH 210, 42 taking CSIT 260, and 24 taking both. Together, how many different students
are taking these two courses? In other words, determine the number of students who are taking
either MATH 210 or CSIT 260.

Solution: Let A be the set of students taking MATH 210, and B the set of students taking
CSIT 260, Then, |A| = 60, |B| = 42, and |A  B| = 24. We want to find |A  B|. According to
PIE,

                             |A  B| = |A| + |B| - |A  B| = 60 + 42 - 24 = 78.

Therefore, 78 students are taking either MATH 210 or CSIT 260.

Example 8.2.7 Among 4689 students, 2112 of them have earned at least 60 credit hours and
2678 of them have earned at most 60 credit hours. How many students are there who have
accumulated exactly 60 hours?

Solution: Let A be the set of students who have earned at least 60 credit hours, and B be the
set of students who have earned at most 60 credit hours. We want to find |A  B|. According
to PIE,

                     4689 = |A  B| = |A| + |B| - |A  B| = 2112 + 2678 - |A  B|.

Hence,

        |A  B| = (2112 + 2678) - 4689 = 101.

There are 101 students who have accumulated exactly 60 credit hours.

                   where U is the universal set containing S.

                   Example 8.2.8 In Example 8.2.6, since there are 78 students taking either MATH 210 or
                   CSIT 260, the number of students taking neither is 4689 - 78 = 4611.

                       The principle of inclusion-exclusion can be extended to any number of sets. The situation is
                   more complicated, because some elements may be double-counted, some triple-counted, etc. To
                   give you a taste of the general result, here is the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets.
                   Theorem 8.2.4 For any three finite sets A, B and C,

                                |A  B  C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A  B| - |A  C| - |B  C| + |A  B  C|.
                   Proof: The union A  B  C is the disjoint union of seven subsets:

                                   A - (B  C), B - (C  A), C - (A  B), (A  B) - (A  B  C),
                                    (B  C) - (A  B  C), (C  A) - (A  B  C), and A  B  C.
                   We can apply an argument similar to the one used in the union of two sets to complete the
                   proof. We leave the details as an exercise.

                   Hands-On Exercise 8.2.4 A group of students claims that each of them had seen at least one
                   part of the Back to the Future trilogy. A quick show of hands reveals that

                       · 47 had watched Part I;
                       · 43 had watched Part II;
                       · 32 had watched Part III;
                       · 33 had watched both Parts I and II;
                       · 27 had watched both Parts I and III;
                       · 25 had watched both Parts II and III;
                       · 22 had watched all three parts.
                   How many students are there in the group?

                        Another useful counting technique is the multiplication principle.

    In many applications, it may be helpful to use an equivalent form.

different ways.

    Now that we have two counting techniques, the addition principle and the multiplication
principle, which one should we use? The major difference between them is whether

    · the jobs can be divided into cases, groups, or categories; or
    · each job can be broken up into steps.
In practice, it helps to draw a picture of the configurations that we are counting.

Example 8.2.9 How many different license plates are there if a standard license plate consists
of three letters followed by three digits?

Solution: We need to decide how many choices we have in each position. Draw a picture to
show the configuration. Draw six lines to represent the six positions. Above each line, describe
briefly the possible candidates for that position, and under each line, write the the number of
choices.

choices:        any           any            any    any       any    any
               letter        letter         letter  digit     digit  digit

# of choices:  26            26             26      10        10     10

This left-to-right configuration suggests that the multiplication principle should be used. The
answer is 26 · 26 · 26 · 10 · 10 · 10 = 2603.

    As you become more experienced, you can argue directly, as follows. There are 26 choices for
each of the three letters, and 10 choices for each digit. So there are 26 · 26 · 26 · 10 · 10 · 10 = 2603

different license plates.

Example 8.2.10 Find the number of positive integers not exceeding 999 that end with 7.

Solution 1: The integers can have one, two, or three digits, so we have to analyze three cases.

    · Case 1. There is only one integer with one digit, namely, the integer 7.
    · Case 2. If there are two digits, the first could be any digit between 1 and 9, and the last

       digit must be 7.

                             choices: 1-9                  7

                             # of choices:      9          1

This gives us nine choices.
252                                                       Chapter 8 Combinatorics

     · Case 3. If there are three digits, the first digit could be any digit between 1 and 9, the
        second any digit between 0 and 9, and the last digit must be 7.

                                                  any

     choices: 1-9                                 digit       7

     # of choices:       9                            10      1

       Hence, there are 90 integers in this case.
Combining the three cases, we have a total of 1+9+90 = 100 integers that meet the requirements.

Solution 2: The integers could be written as three-digit integers if we allow 0 as the leading
digits. For instance, 7 can be written as 007, and 34 as 034. Under this agreement, we have to
fill three positions where the last one is always occupied by the digit 7. The first two digits are
0, 1, 2, . . . , 8, or 9, so there are 10 choices for each position.

                    any                           any

     choices: digit                               digit   7

     # of choices:  10                            10      1

Together, there are 10 · 10 = 100 such integers.

with the digit 3?

Hands-On Exercise 8.2.6 How many natural numbers less than 10000 are there that end
with the digit 0?

Example 8.2.11 Determine the number of four-digit positive integers without repeated digits.

Solution: We want to determine how many choices there are for each place value. The first
digit has nine choices because it cannot be 0. Once the first digit is chosen, there are nine choices
left for the second digit; and then eight choices for the next digit, and seven choices for the last
digit. Together, we have 9 · 9 · 8 · 7 = 4536 four-digit positive integers that do not contain any
repeated digits. Question: Can we start counting from the last digit?

8.2 Addition and Multiplication Principles                                       253

Solution: We want to determine the number of ways to form a subset. Let the n elements be
s1, s2, . . . , sn. To form a subset, we go through each element si and decide whether it should be
included in the subset, thus there are two choices for each element.

# of choices:  2    2                                             2

We have 2 · 2 · · · · · 2 = 2n ways to form the subsets. Thus, |(S)| = 2n.

                     n factors

Example 8.2.13 How many two-digit positive integers do not have consecutive 5s?

Solution 1: There are three disjoint cases:

  (i) both digits are not 5,
  (ii) only the first digit is 5, and
 (iii) only the last digit is 5.

There are 8 · 9 + 9 + 8 = 89 integers that meet the requirement.

Solution 2: An easier solution is to consider the complement of the problem. There is only           It's easier to use
one integer with consecutive 5s, namely, the integer 55. There are 90 two-digit integers, hence      complement!
90 - 1 = 89 of them do not have consecutive 5s.

Hands-On Exercise 8.2.8 How many three-digit natural numbers are there that do not have
consecutive 4s?

to the deck. With replacement, the answer is 523; without replacement, it is 52 · 51 · 50.

Example 8.2.15 A standard New York State license plate consists of three letters followed
by four digits. Determine the number of standard New York State license plates with K as the
first letter or 8 as the first digit.

Solution: The keyword "or" suggests that we are looking at a set union, hence we have to
apply PIE. We need to analyze three possibilities:

    · There are 262 · 104 license plates with K as the first letter.
    · There are 263 · 103 license plates with 8 as the first digit.
    · There are 262 · 103 license plates with K as the first letter and 8 as the first digit.
The answer is 262 · 104 + 263 · 103 - 262 · 103.

  (a) exactly four digits,

How many different PINs are there in each case?

Summary and Review

    · Use the addition principle if the problem can be divided into cases. Make sure the cases
       do not overlap.

    · If the cases overlap, the number of objects belonging to the overlapping cases must be
       subtracted from the total to obtain the correct count.

    · In particular, the principle of inclusion-exclusion states that |A  B| = |A| + |B| - |A  B|.
    · Use the multiplication principle if the problem can be solved in several steps.
    · How can we get started? Imagine you want to list all the possibilities, what is a systematic

       way of doing so? Follow the steps, and count how many objects you would end up with.
    · It may be helpful to use a schematic diagram. Draw one line for each step. Above the lines,

       write the choices. Below the lines, write the number of choices. Apply the multiplication
       principle to finish the problem.
    · If there are other cases involved, repeat, and add the results from all the possible cases.

Exercises 8.2

   1. A professor surveyed the 98 students in her class to count how many of them had watched
       at least one of the three films in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is what she found:

           · 74 had watched Part I;
           · 57 had watched Part II;
           · 66 had watched Part III;

   2. Forty-six students in a film class told the professor that they had watched at least one of
       the three films in The Godfather trilogy. Further inquiry led to the following data:

     four identical Seven-Up cans, and seven identical Mountain Dew cans?

     Hint: How many cans of Cola-Cola, Seven-Up, and Mountain Dew would you pick?

 7. How many five-letter words (technically, we should call them strings, because we do not
     care if they make sense) can be formed using the letters A, B, C, and D, with repetitions
     allowed. How many of them do not contain the substring BAD?

     Hint: For the second question, consider using a complement.

 8. How many different five-digit integers can be formed using the digits 1, 3, 3, 3, 5?

     Hint: The three digits 3 are identical, so we cannot tell the difference between them.
     Consequently, what really matters is where we put the digits 1 and 5. Once we place the
     digits 1 and 5, the remaining three positions must be occupied by the digits 3.

 9. Four cards are chosen at random from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, with replace-

                      8.3 Permutations

                      Let A be a finite set with n elements. For 1  r  n, an r-permutation of A is an ordered
                      selection of r distinct elements from A. In other words, it is the linear arrangement of r distinct
                      objects a1a2 . . . ar, where ai  A for each i. The number of r-permutations of an n-element set
                      is denoted by P (n, r). It also appears in many other forms and names.

                          · The number of permutations of n objects, taken r at a time without replacement.
                          · The number of ways to arrange n objects (in a sequence), taken r at a time without

                             replacement.

                      All of them refer to the same number P (n, r). The keywords are:

The keyword is        (i) "Permutation" or "arrangement," both of which suggest that order does matter.
arrangement; be sure  (ii) "Without replacement" means the entries in the permutation/arrangement are distinct.
no repetition is
allowed.              In  some  textbooks,  the  notation  P (n, r)  is  also  written  as  Pn   or  n Pr .

                                                                                              r

                      Example 8.3.1 The 1-permutations of {a, b, c, d} are

                                                                           a, b, c, d.

                      Consequently, P (4, 1) = 4. The 2-permutations of {a, b, c, d} are

                                                                            ab, ac, ad,

                                                                            ca, cb, cd,
                                                                            da, db, dc.
8.3 Permutations                                                                                    257

Hence, P (4, 2) = 12. What are the 3-permutations and 4-permutations of {a, b, c, d}? Can you
explain why the numbers of 3-permutations and 4-permutations are equal?

    Computing the value of P (n, r) is easy. We want to arrange r objects in a sequence. These
r objects are to be selected from a pool of n items. Hence, there are n ways to fill the first
position. Once we settle with the first position, whatever we put there cannot be used again.
We are left with n - 1 choices for the second position. Likewise, once it is filled, there are only
n - 2 choices for the third position. Now it is clear that P (n, r) is the product of r numbers
of the form n, n - 1, n - 2, . . . . What is the last number in this list? There are r - 1 numbers
before it, so it must be n - (r - 1) = n - r + 1.

Theorem 8.3.1 For all integers n and r satisfying 1  r  n,

                  P (n, r) = n(n - 1) · · · (n - r + 1) =            n!        .

                                                                     (n - r)!

Although    the  formula  P (n, r)  =     n!   is  rather  easy  to  remember,    the  other  form       The formula for
                                       (n-r)!                                                            P (n, r) looks like a

                                         P (n, r) = n(n - 1) · · · (n - r + 1)                           it stops at n - r + 1

                                                                                                  r      remember: it contains

is actually more useful in numeric computation, especially when it is done by hand. We multiply
n by the next smaller integer n - 1, and then the next smaller integer n - 2, and so forth, until
we have a product of r consecutive factors. For instance,

                 P (4, 2) = 4 · 3 = 12, and P (9, 3) = 9 · 8 · 7 = 504.

How about P (n, 1) and P (n, 2)?

Example 8.3.2 How would you compute the value of P (278, 3) by hand, or if your calculator
does not have that nPr button?

Solution: We find P (278, 3) = 278 · 277 · 276 = 21253656.

Hands-On Exercise 8.3.1 Compute P (21, 4) by hand.

Remark.     It follows from the first version of the formula that P (n, n) = n!. The second version
reduces to                                                         n!

                                              n! = P (n, n) = .
                                                                   0!

Consequently, to make the second version works, we have to define 0! = 1.

    It is often easier and less confusing if we use the multiplication principle. Once you realize the
answer involves P (n, r), it is not difficult to figure out the values of n and r. A good start, before
jumping into any calculation, is to ask yourself, how would you list the possible arrangements?
Also, try constructing some examples. These can give you an idea of how many choices you
have in each position.

                       Example 8.3.3 A police station has 12 police officers on duty. In how many ways can they be
                       assigned to foot patrol in five different districts, assuming that we assign only one police officer
                       per district.

                       Solution: Imagine you are the officer who schedules the assignments. You have to assign
                       someone to the first district, and then another officer to the second district, and so forth.

                            district: first    second third    fourth   fifth

                                                      another

                                           any another different . . .  ...

                            choices: officer officer officer

                            # of choices:  12  11     10       9        8

                       There are 12 choices for the first district, 11 for the second, etc. The multiplication principle
                       implies that the answer is 12 · 11 · · ·, which is in the form of P (n, r). Since the product starts
                       with 12, and we need a product of 5 consecutive numbers, the answer is P (12, 5).

                       can we put on a pole?

                       Solution: Since the flags are arranged on a flag pole, the order is important. There are 10
                       choices for the top flag, 9 for the second, and 8 for the third. Therefore, 10 · 9 · 8 = P (10, 3)
                       different signals can be formed.

                        (a) There are no restrictions.
                        (b) f is one-to-one.
                        (c) f is onto.

                           To determine how many functions there are from {1, 3, 4, 7, 9} to Z22, we have to determine
                       the number of ways to assign values to f (1), f (3), f (4), f (7) and f (9).

                            images: f (1)      f (3)  f (4)    f (7)    f (9)

                            choices:

                                        # of choices:

                       (a) If there are no restrictions, we have 22 choices for each of these five images. Hence, there
                       are 22 · 22 · 22 · 22 · 22 = 225 functions.

                       (b) If f is one-to-one, we cannot duplicate the images. So we have 22 choices for f (1), 21 for
                       f (3), and so on. There are P (22, 5) one-to-one functions.
8.3 Permutations  259

(c) There are at most five distinct images, but Z22 has 22 elements, so at least 17 of them will
be left unused. Hence f can never be onto. The number of onto functions is therefore zero.

Hands-On Exercise 8.3.3 How many functions are there from {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} to Z15? How
many of them are one-to-one?

Example 8.3.6 Let A and B be finite sets, with |A| = s and |B| = t. Determine the number                 P (n, r) = 0 if n < r.
of one-to-one functions from A to B.

Solution: How can we come up with a one-to-one function from A to B? We have to specify
the image of each element in A. There are t choices for the first element. Since repeated images
are not allowed, we have only t - 1 choices for the image of the second element in A, and t - 2
choices for the third image, and so forth. The answer is P (t, s).

    What if t < s? We know that in such an event, there does not exist any one-to-one function
from A to B because there are not enough distinct images. Does P (t, s) still make sense? The
product version of the formula says that P (t, s) is a product of s consecutive numbers. Hence,
for example,

                                      P (3, 6) = 3 · 2 · 1 · 0 · (-1) · (-2) = 0,

which means there is no one-to-one function from A to B.

    Not all problems use P (n, r). In many situations, we have to use P (n, r) together with other
numbers. The safest approach is to rely on the addition and multiplication principles.

Example 8.3.7 How many four-digit integers are there that do not contain repeated digits?

Solution: There are 10 choices for each digit, but the answer is not P (10, 4), because we cannot
use 0 as the first digit. To ensure that we have a four-digit integer, the first digit must be nonzero.
This leaves us 9 choice for the first digit. Then we have 9 choices for the second digit, 8 and 7
for the next two. The answer is 9 · 9 · 8 · 7.

Example 8.3.8 Twelve children are playing "musical chairs," with 9 chairs arranged in a
circle on the floor. In how many ways can they be seated?

Solution: The answer is not P (12, 9) because any position can be the first position in a circular
permutation. What matters is the relative placement of the selected objects, all we care is
who is sitting next to whom. The correct answer can be found in the next theorem.

Theorem 8.3.2 The number of circular r-permutations of an n-element set is P (n, r)/r.

Proof: Compare the number of circular r-permutations to the number of linear r-permutations.
Start at any position in a circular r-permutation, and go in the clockwise direction; we obtain
a linear r-permutation. Since we can start at any one of the r positions, each circular r-
permutation produces r linear r-permutations. This means that there are r times as many
circular r-permutations as there are linear r-permutations. Therefore, the number of circular
r-permutations is P (n, r)/r.

Alternate Proof. Let A be the set of all linear r-permutations of the n objects, and let B be
the set of all circular r-permutations. Define a function from A to B as follows. Given any
260  Chapter 8 Combinatorics

r-permutation, form its image by joining its "head" to its "tail." It becomes clear, using the
same argument in the proof above, that f is an r-to-one function, which means f maps r distinct
elements from A to the same image in B. Therefore A has r times as many elements as in B.
This means |A| = r · |B|. Since |A| = P (n, r), we find |B| = P (n, r)/r.

Hands-On Exercise 8.3.4 A circular cardboard has eight dots marked along its rim. In how
many ways can we glue eight beads of different colors, one on each dot?

Hands-On Exercise 8.3.5 In how many ways can we form a necklace with eight beads of
different color?

Remark: When a necklace is flipped around, it is still the same necklace. Thus, the orientation
of the necklace does not matter: we can count the beads clockwise, or counterclockwise.

Example 8.3.9 In how many ways can we arrange 20 knights at a round table? What if two
of them refuse to sit next to each other?

Solution: Without any restriction, there are 20!/20 = 19! ways to seat the 20 knights. To
solve the second problem, use complement. If two of them always sit together, we in effect are
arranging 19 objects in a circle. Among themselves, these two knights can be seated in two
ways, depending on who is sitting on the left. Hence, there are 2 · 19!/19 = 2 · 18! ways to seat
the 20 knights, with two of them always together. Therefore, the final answer to the second
problem is 19! - 2 · 18!.

Summary and Review

    · Use permutation if order matters: the keywords arrangement, sequence, and order suggest
       that we should use permutation.

    · It is often more effective to use the multiplication principle directly.
    · The number of ways to arrange n objects linearly is n!, and the number of ways to arrange

       them in a circle is (n - 1)!.

8.4 Combinations

In many counting problems, the order of arrangement or selection does not matter. In essence,
we are selecting or forming subsets.

Example 8.4.1 Determine the number of ways to choose 4 values from 1, 2, 3, . . . , 20, in
which the order of selection does not matter.

Solution: Let N be the number of ways to choose the 4 numbers. Since the order in which the
numbers are selected does not matter, these are not sequences (in which order of appearance
matters). We can change a selection of 4 numbers into a sequence. The 4 numbers can be
arranged in P (4, 4) = 4! ways. Therefore, all these 4-number selections together produce N ·
4! sequences. The number of 4-number sequences is P (20, 4). Thus, N · 4! = P (20, 4), or
equivalently, N = P (20, 4)/4!.

                    Solution:  The 1-combinations are the singleton sets {a}, {b}, {c}, and {d}. Hence,     4  = 4.

                    Thus,  4   = 4.

                    Proof: The idea is similar to the one we used in the alternate proof of Theorem 8.3.2. Let A be
                    the set of all r-permutations, and let B be the set of all r-combinations. Define f : A  B to be
                    the function that converts a permutation into a combination by "unscrambling" its order. Then
                    f is an r!-to-one function because there are r! ways to arrange (or shuffle) r objects. Therefore

                                                                 |A| = r! · |B|.

                    Since |A| = P (n, r), and |B| =    n  ,  it  follows  that  n  = P (n, r)/r!.

Proof: According to Theorem 8.4.1, we have

       we go through each of them one at a time. Finally, add the results to come up with the
       final answer.

   3. Do we allow repetitions or replacements? This question can also take the form of whether
       the objects are distinguishable or indistinguishable.

   4. Does order matter? If yes, we have to use permutation. Otherwise, use combination.

   5. Sometimes, it may be easier to use the multiplication principle instead of permutation,
       because repetitions may be allowed (in which case, we cannot use permutation, although
       we can still use the multiplication principle). Try drawing a schematic diagram and decide
       what we need from it. If the analysis suggests a pattern that follows the one found in a
       permutation, you can then use the formula for permutation.

   6. Do not forget: it may be easier to work with the complement.

It is often not clear how to get started because there seem to be several ways to start the
construction. For example, how would you distribute soda cans among a group of students?
There are two possible approaches:

  (i) From the perspective of the students. Imagine you are one of the students, which soda
       would you receive?

  (ii) From the perspective of the soda cans. Imagine you are holding a can of soda, to whom
       would you give this soda?

Depending on the actual problem, usually only one of these two approaches would work.
                      264                                                                Chapter 8 Combinatorics

                      Example 8.4.5 Suppose we have to distribute 10 different soda cans to 20 students. It is
                      clear that some students may not get any soda. In fact, some lucky students could receive more
                      than one soda (the problem does not say this cannot happen). Hence, it is easier to start from
                      the perspective of the soda cans.

                          We can give the first soda to any one of the 20 students, and we can also give the second
                      soda to any one of the 20 students. In fact, we always have 20 choices for each soda. Since we
                      have 10 sodas, there are 20 · 20 · · · 20 = 2010 ways to distribute the sodas.

                                                                              10

                      Example 8.4.6 In how many ways can a team of three representatives be selected from a
                      class of 885 students? In how many ways can a team of three representatives consisting of a
                      chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and a secretary be selected?

                      Solution: If we are only interested in selecting three representatives, order does not matter.

                      Hence, the answer would be  885  .  If  we  are  concerned  about  which  offices  these  three  represen-

                      tative will hold, then the answer should be P (885, 3).

A brief tutorial for      Playing cards provide excellent examples for counting problems. Just in case you are not
those who do not      familiar with them, let us briefly review what a deck of playing cards contains.
play cards.
                          · There are 52 playing cards, each of them is marked with a suit and a rank.
                          · There are four suits: spades (), hearts (), diamonds () and clubs ().
                          · Each suit has 13 ranks, labeled A, 2, 3, . . . , 9, 10, J, Q, and K, where A means ace, J

                             means jack, Q means queen, and K means king.
                          · Each rank has 4 suits (see above).

                      of 52 cards.

                      Solution: All we care is which five cards can be found in a hand. This is a selection problem.
                      The answer is 552 .

                      standard deck of 52 cards?
8.4 Combinations                                                                                         265

Example 8.4.8 In how many ways can a deck of 52 cards be dealt in a game of bridge? (In
a bridge game, there are four players designated as North, East, South and West, each of them
is dealt a hand of 13 cards.)

Solution: The difference between this problem and the last example is that the order of dis-

tributing the four bridge hands makes a difference. This is a problem that combines permutations

and combinations. As we had suggested earlier, the best approach is to start from scratch, us-

ing the addition and/or multiplication principles, along with permutation and/or combination

whenever it seems appropriate.

     There are   52      ways to give 13 cards to the first player. Now we are left with 39 cards, from
                 13

which we select 13 to be given to the second player. Now, out of the remaining 26 cards, we have

to give 13 to the third player. Finally, the last 13 cards will be given to the last player (there is

only one way to do it). The number of ways to deal the cards in a bridge game is                 52  39  13 26 .
                                                                                                 13  13

     We could have said the answer is

                                               52 39 26 13
                                                                          .

                                               13 13 13 13

The last factor      13     is the number of ways to give the last 13 cards to the fourth player. Numer-
                     13
         13
ically,  13  = 1, so the two answers are the same. Do not dismiss this extra factor as redundant.

Take note of the nice pattern in this answer. The bottom numbers are 13, because we are

selecting 13 cards to be given to each player. The top numbers indicate how many cards are still

available for distribution at each stage of the distribution. The reasoning behind the solution is

self-explanatory!

Example 8.4.9 Determine the number of five-card poker hands that contain three queens.
How many of them contain, in addition to the three queens, another pair of cards?

Solution:    (a) The first step is to choose the three queens in             4  ways, after which the remaining
                                                                             3
                              48                                                         4   48
two cards can be selected in  2           ways. Therefore, there are altogether          3   2   hands that meet

the requirements.

(b) As in part (a), the three queens can be selected in             4        ways. Next, we need to select the
                                                                    3

pair. We can select any card from the remaining 48 cards (therefore, there are 48 choices), after

which we have to select one from the remaining 3 cards of the same rank. This gives 48 · 3

choices for the pair, right? The answer is NO!

     The first card we picked could be 8, and the second could be 8. However, the first

card could have been 8, and the second 8. These two selections are counted as different

selections, but they are actually the same pair! The trouble is, we are considering "first," and

"second" cards, which in effect imposes an ordering among the two cards, thereby turning it

into a sequence or an ordered selection. We have to divide the answer by 2 to overcome the

double-counting. The answer is therefore 2 48·3 .                                                                         The main question is:
    Here is a better way to count the number of pairs. An important question to ask is                                    choose the suit or the
                                                                                                                          rank first?
     Which one should we pick first: the suit or the rank?

Here, we want to pick the rank first. There are 12 choices (the pair cannot be queens) for the

rank, and among the four cards of that rank, we can pick the two cards in                    4   ways. Therefore,
                                                                                             2   = 12 · 4·3 2 = 48·3 2 .

the  answer  is  12  2   .  Numerically,  the  two    answers  are  identical,  because  12  2

In summary: the final answer is           4  · 12  4  .

Hands-On Exercise 8.4.9 How many bridge hands contain exactly four spades and four
hearts?

Hands-On Exercise 8.4.10 How many bridge hands are there containing exactly four spades,
three hearts, three diamonds, and three clubs?

Example 8.4.10 How many positive integers not exceeding 99999 contain exactly three 7s?

Solution: Regard each legitimate integer as a sequence of five digits, each of them selected

from 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9. For example, the integer 358 can be considered as 00358. Three out of

the five positions must be occupied by 7. There are       5  ways to select these three slots. The
                                                          3
                                                                                           5
remaining two positions can be filled with any of the other nine digits. Hence, there are  3  · 92

such integers.

Example 8.4.11 How many five-digit positive integers contain exactly three 7s?

Solution: Unlike the last example, the first of the five digits cannot be 0. Yet, the answer is

not  5  · 9 · 8.  Yes, there are  5  choices for the placement of the three 7s, but some of these
     3                            3

selections may have put the 7s in the last four positions. This leaves the first digit unfilled. The

nine choices counted by 9 allows a zero to be placed in the first position. The result is, at best,

a four-digit number. The correct approach is to consider two cases:

     · Case 1. If the first digit is not 7, then there are eight ways to fill this slot. Among the

     remaining four positions, three of them must be 7, and the last one can be any digit other

     than 7. So there are 8 ·     4  · 9 integers in this category.
                                  3

     · Case 2. If the first digit is 7, we still have to put the other two 7s in the other four
                           4
     positions. There are  2      · 92 such integers.

Together, the two cases give a total of 8 ·  4  ·9+    4  · 92 = 774 integers.

According to PIE, the final answer is

                  6 12                 +  8 10   -     684        .

    The proof of the next result uses what we call a combinatorial or counting argument. In
general, a combinatorial argument does not rely on algebraic manipulation. Rather, it uses the
combinatorial significance of the situations to solve the problem.

argument.
                 summation on the left is the sum of the number of subsets of S of all possible cardinalities. In

                 other words, this is the total number of subsets in S. We learned earlier that S has 2n subsets,

                 which establishes the identity immediately.

8.5 The Binomial Theorem

A binomial is a polynomial with exactly two terms. The binomial theorem gives a formula
for expanding (x + y)n for any positive integer n.

    How do we expand a product of polynomials? We pick one term from the first polynomial,
multiply by a term chosen from the second polynomial, and then multiply by a term selected
from the third polynomial, and so forth. In the special case of (x + y)n, we are selecting either
x or y from each of the n binomials x + y to form a product. Some of these products will be
identical, hence we need to collect their coefficients. The expansion of (x + y)3 is demonstrated
below.

                       What happens when we expand (x + y)n?

                            If we select y from k copies of the (x + y)s, and x from the other n - k copies, their product

                       will be xn-kyk. Therefore, in the expansion of (x + y)n, a typical term will be of the form

                       xn-kyk, where 0  k  n. The question is, what is its coefficient in the expansion, after we

                       collect like terms? This coefficient is the number of times the product xn-kyk appears when we

                       multiply out (x + y)n in the way described above. It depends on which k copies of the (x + y)s

                       we will choose y from.    There are        n     choices, hence the product xn-kyk appears                n  times.
                                                                  k                                                              k
                                                 n                                            n
                       Thus, the coefficient is  k  .  For  this  reason,  we  also     call  k   the binomial coefficients.

                       Theorem 8.5.1 (Binomial Theorem) For any positive integer n,

                                                       (x + y)n =          n

                                                                                        x y.

                            Because of the symmetry in the formula, we can interchange x and y. In addition, we also

                       have  n  =    n  .  Consequently,    the   binomial     theorem  can      be  written   in  three  other  forms:

Here is how to
remember them.                                         (x + y)n =          n

                                                                                n k n-k
                                                                                        xy ,
                                                                           k=0 k

                                                                           n         n

                                                       (x + y)n =                             k n-k
                                                                                              xy .
                                                                           k=0 n - k

                       You need not worry which one to use. They are all the same! This is how to remember these

                       four different forms. In each term, the powers of x and y always add up to n. If the power of

                       one of the two variables is k, where 0  k  n, then the power of the other must be n - k, and

                       we need to multiply the coefficient        n  ,  which  is  the  same  as    n   ,  to  their  product.
                                                                  k                               n-k

                            When expanding (x + y)n, it may be helpful if you first lay out all the terms xn, xn-1y,

                       xn-2y2, and so forth. Then you fill in with the binomial coefficients. For instance, to expand

                       (x + y)3, we first list all the terms that we expect fo find:

                                           (x + y)3 =             x3 +         x2y +             xy2 +         y3.
8.5 The Binomial Theorem                                                                       271

Next we fill in the binomial coefficients:

                          (x + y)3 = 3 x3 + 3 x2y + 3 xy2 + 3 y3.
                                          0        1            2             3

Finally, evaluate the binomial coefficients and simplify the result.

                              (x + y)3 = x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3.

In a similar way, we also find (x - y)3 = x3 - 3x2y + 3xy2 - y3. Note the similarity between the
two expansions.

Example 8.5.1 Compute (x + y)4.

Solution: Following the steps we outlined above, we find

                  (x + y)4 =     4 x4 + 4 x3y + 4 x2y2 + 4 xy3 + 4 y4
                                 0              1            2             3           4

                              = x4 + 4x3y + 6x2y2 + 4xy3 + y4.

Since    n  =  n  = 1, the expansion always starts with xn and ends with yn.
         0     n

Example 8.5.2 Compute (x - y)4.

Solution: We find

            (x - y)4 = [x + (-y)]4

                     = 4 x4 + 4 x3(-y) + 4 x2(-y)2 + 4 x(-y)3 + 4 (-y)4
                           0           1               2                   3              4

                     = x4 - 4x3y + 6x2y2 - 4xy3 + y4.

Take note of the alternating signs in the expansion. This suggests that we could expand (A-B)n

the exact same way we would with (A + B)n, except that the signs alternate.

We can carry out the expansion by following these steps. First, list all the terms we expect

to find

                  (x - y)4 =     x4             x3y             x2y2          xy3         y4.

Next, fill in the signs:

               (x - y)4 =     x4 -              x3y +           x2y2 -        xy3 +       y4,

and then the binomial coefficients:

                  (x - y)4 = 4 x4 - 4 x3y + 4 x2y2 - 4 xy3 + 4 y4.
                              0              1            2             3           4

Finally, compute the binomial coefficients to finish the expansion.

Example 8.5.3 Expand (2x - 3y)5.

Solution: The expansion yields

       (2x)5 - 5 (2x)4(3y) + 5 (2x)3(3y)2 - 5 (2x)2(3y)3 + 5 (2x)(3y)4 - (3y)5.

Therefore, (2x - 3y)5 = 32x5 - 240x4y + 720x3y2 - 1080x2y3 + 810xy4 - 243y5.

Solution: Since

                                     (1 + x)102 =  102

                                                         102 k

                                                   k=0 k

the term containing x3 is  102  x3.  Therefore,  the  coefficient  is  102    .  Depending  on  which      form

of the binomial theorem you use, you may end up with the term             99     x3.  Numerically,   this  gives

us the same coefficient, because 99 102 = 102-99 102 = 3 102 .

we need k = 4. The coefficient is 94 25 · 34·.

                         To compute the binomial coefficients quickly, one may use the Pascal triangle, in which

                    Constructing the Pascal triangle is easy. We generate the rows one at a time. The extreme
                    ends are always 1. Each of the interior entries is the sum of the two entries right above it in the
                    preceding row. For instance, the next row (for n = 7) should be

                                             1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1

                    Such computations produce the right binomial coefficients, because of the next result.

                    fixed element, say x. If a subset contains x, then the other k - 1 elements must be selected from

                    the remaining n - 1 elements of A. Otherwise, if the subset does not contain x, then all its k

                    elements must be selected from the other n - 1 elements of A. The numbers of these two kinds

                    of subsets are given by  n-1   and      n-1   ,  respectively.   The   theorem      now  follows   immediately  by

                    Example 8.5.10 Use the Pascal's triangle to expand

                    (a) (C - D)5                   (b) (2A + 5B)3                             (c) (3C - 4B)4

Solution:  Draw the values of   n  from the Pascal triangle directly. The answers are:
                                k

(a) (C - D)5 = C5 - 5C4D + 10C3D2 - 10C2D3 + 5CD4 - D5.

(b) (2a + 5B)3 = 8A3 + 60A2B + 150AB2 + 125B3.

(c) (3C - 4B)4 = 81C4 - 432C3B + 864C2B2 - 768CB3 + 256B4.

Many interesting results can be derived from the binomial theorem.

Example 8.5.11    Setting x = y = 1, we obtain a simple (analytic) proof of the familiar identity
2n = k=0 k n n .

Example 8.5.12    Letting x = 1 and y = -1 yields 0 =        k=0 n (-1)k  n  .  We can rewrite it as
                                                                          k

Combinatorially, this means the number of subsets of even cardinalities equals the number of
subsets of odd cardinalities.

Summary and Review

    · The binomial theorem can be expressed in four different but equivalent forms.
    · The expansion of (x + y)n starts with xn, then we decrease the exponent in x by one,

       meanwhile increase the exponent of y by one, and repeat this until we have yn.
    · The next few terms are therefore xn-1y, xn-2y2, etc., which end with yn.
    · In general, the sum of exponents in x and y is always n. Hence, the general term is xkyn-k,

       whose coefficient is kn .
    · The expansion of (x + y)n and (x - y)n look almost identical, except that the signs in

       (x - y)n alternate.

Section 0.1

   1. In x · y + z, the product xy is added to z. In other words, x · y + z = xy + z. In x(y + z),
       the sum y + z is multiplied to x. In fact, x(y + z) = xy + xz.

   2. Since x2 - 5 is an expression, we have no equation to solve. The author probably intends
       to say "solve the equation x2 - 5 = 0." However, this is different from saying, for example,
       "solve the equation x2 - 5 = 4." Without knowing the right-hand side of an equation, we
       have no idea what we are solving. This illustrates the importance of saying and writing in
       complete sentences.

4. (a) Remember: we need to group everything to one side of the equation so that the other

                                                           3

the identity always holds.

   1. The completed statement is "n is odd  n = 2k + 1 for some integer k."
       Proof : Assume n is odd, then we can write n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. We find
                                  n2 = (2k + 1)2 = 4k2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k2 + 2k) + 1,

     where 2k2 + 2k is an integer. Hence, n2 is also odd.

   4. The statement "0 > x > 1" means "(0 > x)  (x > 1)," which is always false because no
       such x exists.

       (b) True.
       (c) False, because an even number is defined as an integral multiple of 2.
       (d) True, see (c).

4. False, because 02 = 0.

5. True, because we can pick y = 0, then regardless of what x is, we always have xy = 0 < 1.

6. (a) There exists a prime number x such that the number x + 1 is prime.
   (b) There exists a prime number x > 2 such that the number x + 1 is prime.
   (c) For any integer k, the number 2k + 1 is odd.
   (d) There exists an integer k such that 2k is odd.
   (e) There exists a number x such that x2 is an integer and x is not an integer.

7. One solution is: "There is a Discrete Mathematics student who has not taken Calculus I
   and Calculus II." Because of De Morgan's laws, we can also state the negation as "There is
   a Discrete Mathematics student who has not taken Calculus I or has not taken Calculus II."

Section 3.1

   1. The distance between a and 13 a + 23 b is

                                       12                         22 2
                                           a + b - a = b - a = (b - a).
                                       33                         33 3

     The  distance     between      1  a+  2  b  and  b  is
                                    3      3

                                              12                  11 1
                                       b - a + b = b - a = (b - a).

     Since  2  (b - a)  >   1  (b - a),  the     point   1  a+    2  b  is  closer  to  b   than   to   a.
            3               3                            3        3

2. 6 = 2 · 3, 40 = 23 · 5, 32 = 25 · 1, and 15 = 20 · 15.

3. The five consecutive integers 722, 723, 724, 725, and 726 are composite.

4.   Since  a  and  b  are  rational     numbers,     we     can  write     a  =    m   and    b  =  r  for  some  integers  m,
                                                                                    n                s

     n, r, and s, where n, s = 0. Then the midpoint of the interval [a, b] is

                                           a + b 1 m r ms + nr                              ,
                                                 =              +=
                                              2 2n s                              2ns

     where  ms+nr       and    2ns  are  integers,    and    2ns  =     0.  Hence,     a+b  is  a  rational  number  between
                                                                                         2

     a and b.

5. Using the same argument in Hands-On Exercise 3.1.4, we see that 13 a + 23 b is rational,
   and we have learned from Hands-On Exercise 3.1.1 that it is closer to b than to a.

6. Let g(x) = 1 + x cos x. Noting that g(-) = 1 -  < 0 and g(0) = 1 > 0, we conclude
   that the equation g(x) = 0 has a real solution between - and 0.

Section 3.2

   1. Assume n is odd, we can write n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then
                         n3 = (2k + 1)3 = 8k3 + 12k2 + 6k + 1 = 2(4k3 + 6k2 + 2k) + 1,

       where 4k3 + 6k2 + 2k is an integer. Thus, n3 is odd.
   2. Assume x3 + 6x2 + 12x + 8 = 0. Since

                                              x3 + 6x2 + 12x + 8 = (x + 2)3,
       we must have (x + 2)3 = 0. It follows that x = -2.

3. There are two cases.
       · Case 1: If n is even, then n = 2q for some integer q, so that
                                    n3 + n = (2q)3 + 2q = 8q3 + 2q = 2(4q3 + q),
          where 4q3 + q is an integer.
       · Case 2: If n is odd, then n = 2q + 1 for some integer q, so that
               n3 + n = (2q + 1)3 + (2q + 1) = 8q3 + 12q2 + 8q + 2 = 2(4q3 + 6q2 + 4q + 1),
          where 4q3 + 6q2 + 4q + 1 is an integer.

   In both cases, we have proved that n3 + n is even.

Section 3.3

   1. Assume x is a real number such that x = -5 and x = 7, then x + 5 = 0 and x - 7 = 0.
       Since 2x2 + 5 can never be zero, we find

                                                (2x2 + 3)(x + 5)(x - 7) = 0.

Therefore, if (2x2 + 3)(x + 5)(x - 7) = 0, then either x = -5, or x = 7.

2. We shall prove the contrapositive of the given statement. Let x and y be real numbers
   such that xy = 0. Then either x = 0 or y = 0. Therefore, if x = 0 and y = 0, then xy = 0.

3. Assume x2  49, we want to prove that |x|  7. Suppose, to the contrary, |x| < 7. This
   means -7 < x < 7. We need to study two cases.

· If -7 < x < 0, we find 0 < x2 < 49.
· If 0  x < 7, we find 0  x2 < 49.

   In both cases, we have x2 < 49. This contradicts the given assumption that x2  49.
   Therefore, we must have |x|  7.
4. Suppose there exist some positive numbers x and y such that x + y = x + y, then

                                               2                    
                               x + y = x + y = x + 2 xy + y,

implying that                                        
                                              0 = 2 xy,

which   is  possible  only     when  xy  = 0. But     both  x  and  y  are  positive,  hence  xy  = 0.  This
                                                      
contradiction shows that x + y = x + y for all positive numbers x and y.

               
5. Suppose 3 is rational, then we can write

                                              m
                                                3=
                                                      n

for some positive integers m and n such that m and n do not share any common divisor

except  1   (hence  m  is  in  its  simplest  term).  Squaring  both   sides  and  cross-multiplying    gives
                    n

                                              3n2 = m2.

Thus, m2 is a multiple of 3; consequently, m is also a multiple of 3. Then we can write
m = 3s for some integer s. The equation above becomes

                                          3n2 = m2 = (3s)2 = 9s2.
284                                         Appendix A Solutions to Hands-On Exercises

     Hence,

                                                     n2 = 3s2,

     which implies that n2 is a multiple of 3, thus n is also a multiple of 3. We have proved
     that both m and n are divisible by 3. Thiscontradicts the assumption that m and n do
     not share any common divisor. Therefore, 3 must be irrational.

6. () If n is odd, we can write n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then

                            n2 = (2k + 1)2 = 4k2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k2 + 2k) + 1,

     where 2k2 + 2k is an integer. Hence, n2 is odd.

     () We shall prove its contrapositive: if n is even, then n2 is even. If n is even, we can
     write n = 2k for some integer k. Then

                                         n2 = (2k)2 = 4k2 = 2 · 2k2,

     where 2k2 is an integer, which means n2 is even.

Section 3.4

1. We proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the left-hand side reduces to 1 · 2 = 2, and

     the  right-hand  side  becomes  1·2·3  =  2.  Hence,  the   identity  holds  when    n  =  1.    Assume  the
                                       3

     identity holds when n = k for some integer k  1; that is, assume

                                                                       k(k + 1)(k + 2)
                      1 · 2 + 2 · 3 + 3 · 4 + · · · + k(k + 1) =

                                                                                3

     for some integer k  1. We want to show that it also holds when n = k + 1; that is, we
     want to show that

             1 · 2 + 2 · 3 + 3 · 4 + · · · + (k + 1)(k + 2) =         (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3)        .

                                                                                  3

     It follows from the inductive hypothesis that

     1 · 2 + 2 · 3 + · · · + (k + 1)(k + 2) = 1 · 2 + 2 · 3 + · · · + k(k + 1) + (k + 1)(k + 2)

                                                   =     k(k + 1)(k + 2)   + (k + 1)(k + 2)

                                                                 3

                                                                             k
                                                   = (k + 1)(k + 2) + 1

                                                                              3

                                                   = (k + 1)(k + 2)        k+3    .

                                                                           3

     This completes the induction.

2. We proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the left-hand side reduces to 1 · 2 · 3 = 6, and

     the  right-hand  side  reduces  to  1·2·3·4  =  6.  Hence,  the  identity  holds  when     n  =  1.  Assume
                                             4

     it holds when n = k for some integer k  1; that is, assume

                             k k(k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3)
                                i(i + 1)(i + 2) =

                            i=1 4

     for some integer k  1. We want to show that it also holds when n = k + 1; that is, we
     want to show that

                            k+1 (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3)(k + 4)
                            i(i + 1)(i + 2) =                                          .
                            i=1 4
Appendix A Solutions to Hands-On Exercises                                      285

It follows from the inductive hypothesis that

k+1                            k

     i(i + 1)(i + 2) =              i(i + 1)(i + 2) + (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3)

i=1                            i=1

                   =           k(k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3)  + (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3)

                                    4

                                                       k
                   = (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3) + 1

                                                       4

                   = (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3)             k+4    .

                                                       4

This completes the induction.

3. We proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the left-hand side reduces to 1 + 4 = 5, and

   the right-hand side becomes 13 (42 - 1) = 5. Hence, the identity holds when n = 1. Assume
   it holds when n = k for some integer k  1; that is, assume that

                   1 + 4 + 42 + · · · + 4k = 1 (4k+1 - 1)
                                                  3

for some integer k  1. We want to show that it also holds when n = k + 1; that is, we

want to show that  1 + 4 + 42 + · · · + 4k+1 = 1 (4k+2 - 1).
                                                     3

It follows from the inductive hypothesis that

     1 + 4 + 42 + · · · + 4k+1 = 1 + 4 + 42 + · · · + 4k + 4k+1

                                      = 13 (4k+1 - 1) + 4k+1
                                      = 13 (4k+1 - 1 + 3 · 4k+1)
                                      = 13 (4 · 4k+1 - 1)
                                      = 13 (4k+2 - 1).

This completes the induction.

Section 3.5

   1. We use induction to prove the claim. Note that n2 + 3n + 2 = 6 when n = 1, so the claim
       is true. Assume it is true when n = k for some integer k  1, so we can write

                                                       k2 + 3k + 2 = 2q

       for some integer q. We want to show that the claim is still true when n = k + 1, that is,

                                               (k + 1)2 + 3(k + 1) + 2 = 2Q

       for some integer Q. We find

                                (k + 1)2 + 3(k + 1) + 2 = k2 + 5k + 6
                                                                 = (k2 + 3k + 2) + 2k + 4
                                                                 = 2q + 2k + 4
                                                                 = 2(q + k + 2),

       where q + k + 2 is an integer. Thus, the claim is still true when n = k + 1, thereby
       completing the induction.

2. Proceed by induction on n. Since 1 < 21, the inequality is valid when n = 1. Assume it is
   valid when n = k for some integer k  1; that is, assume

                                                          k < 2k

     for some integer k  1. We want to show that

                                                k + 1 < 2k+1.

     Notice that for k  1, we have 1 < 2k. Hence, it follows from the inductive hypothesis
     that

                                    k + 1 < 2k + 1 < 2k + 2k = 2 · 2k = 2k+1.

     This completes the induction and the proof of the given inequality.

3. Proceed by induction on n. When n = 0, the LHS of the identity reduces to 1, and the

     RHS  of  the  identity  becomes  3  1-  2  =  3·    1  =  1.  Thus,  the   identity  holds  when  n  =  0.

     for some integer k  0. We want to show that it also holds when n = k + 1. That is, we
     want to show that

                             24                    2 k+1                  2 k+2

     According to the inductive hypothesis,

                                                = 3 1-             2 k+2     .

                                                                   3

     This completes the induction and the proof of the given identity.

Section 3.6

1. Proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, 2, the proposed formula for cn says c1 =
   5 · 3 - 4 · 2 = 7, and c2 = 5 · 9 - 4 · 4 = 29. They agree with the given initial values, so the
   formula holds for n = 1, 2. Assume the formula is valid for n = 1, 2, . . . , k for some integer
   k  2. In particular, assume

                   ck = 5 · 3k - 4 · 2k, and ck-1 = 5 · 3k-1 - 4 · 2k-1.

     We want to show that the formula still works when n = k + 1. In other words, we want to

     show that

                                         ck+1 = 5 · 3k+1 - 4 · 2k+1.
Appendix A Solutions to Hands-On Exercises  287

       Using the recurrence relation and the inductive hypothesis, we find

                              ck+1 = 5ck - 6ck-1
                                       = 5(5 · 3k - 4 · 2k) - 6(5 · 3k-1 - 4 · 2k-1)
                                       = 25 · 3k - 20 · 2k - 30 · 3k-1 + 24 · 2k-1
                                       = 25 · 3k - 20 · 2k - 10 · 3 · 3k-1 + 12 · 2 · 2k-1
                                       = 25 · 3k - 20 · 2k - 10 · 3k + 12 · 2k
                                       = 15 · 3k - 8 · 2k
                                       = 5 · 3 · 3k - 4 · 2 · 2k
                                       = 5 · 3k+1 - 4 · 2k+1,

       which is what we want to establish. This completes the induction, and hence the claim
       that bn = 2n + 3n.

   2. Proceed by induction on n. The claim is true for n = 2, 3, because

                                                      2 = 2 · 1 + 3 · 0,
                                                      3 = 2 · 0 + 3 · 1.

       Assume the claim holds when n = 2, 3, . . . , k for some integer k  3. In particular, since
       k - 1  2, we may assume that

                                                        k - 1 = 2x + 3y
       for some nonnegative integers x and y. We want to show that the claim is still true when
       n = k + 1. We find

                                                 k + 1 = (k - 1) + 2
                                                           = (2x + 3y) + 2
                                                           = 2(x + 1) + 3y,

       where x+1 and y are nonnegative integers. Therefore, the claim is still true when n = k+1.
       This completes the induction.

   5. Only {x  R | 1 < x < 7} can be represented by the interval notation (1, 7), because we
       have to include all the real numbers between 1 and 7.

   6. Because [2, 7] = {x  R | 2  x  7} includes decimal numbers and integers, but
       {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} contains only integers.

   7. False, because the interval (-2, 3) contains decimal numbers as well as integers, but the
       set {-1, 0, 1, 2} contains only integers.

   8. Z-.
   9. The notation [7, 7] means {x  R | 7  x  7}. Since equality is allowed, this set contains

       only one number, namely, the number 7. In other words, [7, 7] = {7}. However, the sets
       (7, 7), (7, 7] and [7, 7) are empty.

10. Both sets have two elements. The elements of 0, {1} are 0 and {1}, one of them is an
     integer, the other is a set. The elements of {0}, {1} are the two sets {0} and {1}.

11. (a) 0 (b) the set is infinite (c) 1

12. It is incorrect to say || =  because || is a number (its value is 0), but  is a set, they
     are incompatible.

Section 4.2     (b) true

   1. (a) true

2. False, because 3  [3, 4) but 3 / (3, 4).

3. Since (3, 4) consists of numbers strictly between 3 and 4, every number we can find in
   (3, 4) also appears as a member of [3, 4]. However, the interval [3, 4] also contains the two
   numbers 3 and 4, which are not members of the interval (3, 4). Therefore, it is true that
   (3, 4)  [3, 4]. Likewise, we also have (3, 4)  (3, 4].

4. (a) According to Theorem 4.2.2, the empty set is the subset of any set, including {}.
   Thus, the statement is true.

   (b) For S  T , every element of S must be an element of T as well. Here, the set {1} has
   only one element: the number 1, which is also an element of 1, {1, 2} . Therefore, the
   statement is true.

   (c) This time, 1 does not appear in {1}, {1, 2} as an element. Notice that {1}, {1, 2}
   has two elements, both of which are sets, namely, {1} and {1, 2}. Therefore, the statement
   is false. It would have been true if it were {1}  {1}, {1, 2} .

                           2 {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}
                           3 {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4}
                           4 {1, 2, 3, 4}

     The final answer is

     ({1, 2, 3, 4}) =     , {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4},

6. The set  has no element, but the set {} has one element (namely, the empty set). In
   terms of cardinality, || = 0, and |{}| = 1. Yes, it is true that () = {}.

7. There are 23 = 8 elements in ({, , }). They are

                 , {}, {}, {}, {, }, {, }, {, }, and {, , }.

8. Since || = 0, the power set () has only 20 = 1 element, which is  itself. Therefore,
   () = {}.

9. Yes, because |A| is a number, and 2|A| does equal to |(A)|. The notation 2A is illegal
   because A is a set, hence, it does not make much sense to raise 2 to a power that is not a
   number.

   3. (a) Because {-1, -2, -3, . . .} and {1, 2, 3, . . .} are sets, but 0 is not, we cannot form their

       (b) This is worse than (a): all three components are not sets! Of course, it does not make
       much sense to take the union of things that are not even sets. To fix it, we need to insert
       curly braces (set brackets) as in (a).
       (c) Same problem as in (b), plus a wrong notation for set union. To fix it, insert curly

   5. Solution 1: Let x  A  (B  C). Then x  A, and x  B  C. We know that x  B  C
       implies that x  B or x  C. So we have

         (i) x  A and x  B, or
        (ii) x  A and x  C;

       equivalently,

         (i) x  A  B, or
        (ii) x  A  C.

       Thus, x  (A  B)  (A  C). We have proved that A  (B  C)  (A  B)  (A  C).

Now let x  (A  B)  (A  C). Then x  A  B or x  A  C. From the definition of
intersection, we find

 (i) x  A and x  B, or
 (ii) x  A and x  C.

Both conditions require x  A, so we can rewrite them as

 (i) x  A, and
 (ii) x  B or x  C;

equivalently,

 (i) x  A, or
 (ii) x  B  C.

Thus, x  A  (B  C). This proves that (A  B)  (A  C)  A  (B  C). Together with
A  (B  C)  (A  B)  (A  C), we conclude that A  (B  C) = (A  B)  (A  C).

Solution 2: We note that                                 (defn. of intersection)
                                                         (defn. of union)
     x  A  (B  C)  x  A  x  (B  C)                       (distributive law)
                             x  A  (x  B  x  C)          (defn. of intersection)
                             (x  A  x  B)  (x  A  x  C)  (defn. of union)
                             (x  A  B)  (x  A  C)
                             x  (A  B)  (A  C)

it follows that A  (B  C) = (A  B)  (A  C).

   6. Assume A  B and A  C. We want to show that A  B  C. To achieve this goal, let
       x  A. Since A  B, we also have x  B. Likewise A  C implies that x  C. Now x  B
       and x  C together imply that, according to the definition of set intersection, x  B  C.
       We have proved that x  A implies that x  B  C; it follows that A  B  C.

Section 5.4

   1. The only common divisors of 3 and 5 are ±1. Hence, gcd(3, 5) = 1.

2. The largest positive divisor of -8 is 8, which also divides 0. Thus, gcd(0, -8) = 8.

3. By applying the theorem repeatedly, we have

                     732 = 153 · 4 + 120,      gcd(732, 153) = gcd(153, 120)
                     153 = 120 · 1 + 33,
                     120 = 33 · 3 + 21,        gcd(153, 120) = gcd(120, 33)
                      33 = 21 · 1 + 12,
                      21 = 12 · 1 + 9,         gcd(120, 33) = gcd(33, 21)
                      12 = 9 · 1 + 3,
                                               gcd(33, 21) = gcd(21, 12)
                        9 = 3 · 3 + 0,
                                               gcd(21, 12) = gcd(12, 9)

                                               gcd(12, 9) = gcd(9, 3)

                                               gcd(9, 3)          = gcd(3, 0) = 3.

Therefore, gcd(732, 153) = 3.

4. By applying division repeatedly, we find

     6958 = 2478 · 2 + 2002                   gcd(6958, 2478) = gcd(2478, 2002),
     2478 = 2002 · 1 + 476
     2002 = 476 · 4 + 98                      gcd(2478, 2002) = gcd(2002, 476),
      476 = 98 · 4 + 84
                                              gcd(2002, 476) = gcd(476, 98),
        98 = 84 · 1 + 14
        84 = 14 · 6 + 0                       gcd(476, 98) = gcd(98, 84),

                                              gcd(98, 84)  = gcd(84, 14),

                                              gcd(84, 14)  = gcd(14, 0) = 14.

     Therefore, gcd(6958, 2478) = 14.

5. We find gcd(732, 153) = 3, as follows:

                                     7(5m + 7n) - 5(7m + 5n) = 24n,

                                   -5(5m + 7n) + 7(7m + 5n) = 24m,

     we know that gcd(5m + 7n, 7m + 5n) divides both 24n and 24m. Since gcd(m, n) = 1, we
     conclude that gcd(5m + 7n, 7m + 5n) divides 24. Thus, gcd(5m + 7n, 7m + 5n) equals to
     1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24.

3. Suppose 7 is rational, then we can write
                                                         m
                                                           7=
                                                                  n

   for some positive integers m and n that do not share any common divisor except 1. Squar-
   ing both sides and cross-multiplying gives

                                                        7n2 = m2.

Thus, 7 divides m2. Since 7 is prime, Euclid's lemma asserts that 7 must also divide m.
Then we can write m = 7s for some integer s. The equation above becomes

                                          7n2 = m2 = (7q)2 = 49q2.

Hence,

                                                n2 = 7q2,

which implies that 7 divides n2. Again, since 7 is prime, Euclid's lemma implies that 7
also divides n. We have proved that both m and n are divisible by 7. Thiscontradicts
the assumption that m and n do not share any common divisor. Therefore, 7 must be
irrational.

Section 5.6

   1. Since 153 = 3 · 3 · 17, and 72 = 2 · 2 · 3 · 61, we determine that gcd(153, 72) = 3.

   2. By writing the factorizations as
                                         23 · 5 · 7 · 112 = 23 · 30 · 51 · 71 · 112,
                                        22 · 32 · 52 · 72 = 22 · 32 · 52 · 72 · 110,

it becomes clear that gcd(23 · 5 · 7 · 112, 22 · 32 · 52 · 72) = 22 · 30 · 51 · 71 · 110 = 4 · 5· = 140.

3. We find lcm(23 · 5 · 7 · 112, 22 · 32 · 52 · 72) = 23 · 32 · 52 · 72 · 112 = 10672200.

                                   6(4m - 6n) - 4(6m + 4n) = -52n,
                                   4(4m - 6n) + 6(6m + 4n) = 52m,

   we know that gcd(4m - 6n, 6m + 4n) divides both -52n and 52m. Since gcd(m, n) = 1,
   we conclude that gcd(4m - 6n, 6m + 4n) divides 52. Consequently, gcd(4m - 6n, 6m + 4n)
   equals to 1, 2, 4, 13, 26, or 52. It follows that lcm(4m - 6n, 6m + 4n) equals to mn, mn/2,
   mn/4, mn/13, mn/26, or mn/52.

7. Assume x  4Z  6Z, then x  4Z and x  6Z. This means x is a multple of both 4
   and 6. Consequently, x is a multiple of lcm(4, 6) = 12, which means x  12Z. Thus,
   4Z  6Z  12Z.

   Next, assume x  12Z, then x is a multiple of 12. Consequently, x is a multiple of 3, as
   well as a multiple of 4. This means x  4Z, and x  6Z. As a result, x  4Z  6Z. Thus,
   12Z  4Z  6Z. Together with 4Z  6Z  12Z, we conclude that 4Z  6Z = 12Z.

                        0             05 - 0 = 0
                        1             15 - 1 = 0
                        2             25 - 2 = 30  0
                        3             35 - 3 = 340  0
                        4             45 - 4 = 1020  0

     Therefore, for any integer n, we always have n5 - n  0 (mod 5), which means 5 | (n5 - n).

   1. The domain is R, and the codomain is Z.
   2. The range is R+  {0}. Hence, the square root function is not onto.
   3. No, because R+ is a set, and 0 is a number. We can only take union of two sets.

Section 6.2

   1. Only f is a well-defined function. The rule for g does not assign any value to a. In other
       words, g(a) is undefined. For h, two values are associated to b. That is, there are two
       possible values for the image h(b), which is not allowed.

2. No, r is not a well-defined function because the value of r(x) should be the same regardless
   of which day of the week it is.

3. No, s is not a well-defined function because the images s(x) are undefined for 2  x  3.

4. We also have

                    n({a, b}) = n({a, d}) = n({b, c}) = n({c, d}) = 2.

The value of n(S) must be between 0 and 4, inclusive.

Section 6.3

1. Assume g(x1) = g(x2), then

                                     5 - 7x1 = 5 - 7x2,

which clearly implies x1 = x2. Hence, g is one-to-one.

2. Assume h(x1) = h(x2), then                  

                                       x1 - 2 = x2 - 2.

Squaring both sides yields x1 - 2 = x2 - 2, which clearly implies x1 = x2. Hence, h is
one-to-one.

3. Assume k(x1) = k(x2), then

                                          ln x1 = ln x2.

Raising both sides to the power of e, we find

                                       eln x1 = eln x2 ,

which simplifies to x1 = x2. Thus, k is a one-to-one function.

Alternatively, we can look at the derivative k (x) = 1/x. Since k (x) > 0 for all x > 0, the
function k is increasing. Thus, k is one-to-one.

4. First, we use the two-point form to find the equation of the line:

     y-2 5-2 3
     =                    =- .
     x-3 1-3 2

     This simplifies to y = - 32 x + 213 . However, this is not the correct answer. We want a
     function, so the answer should be

     f : [1, 3]  [2, 5],              3 13
                          f (x) = - x + .

                                      22

5. There are many possible answers, we only give two here, their graphs are the straight lines
   that join the opposite corners of the rectangle framed by the domain and codomain. The
   straight line joining the two corners (3, 2) and (8, 5) yields the example

     f : [3, 8]  [2, 5],            31
                          f (x) = x + ,

                                    55

     and the line joining the two corners (3, 5) and (8, 2) gives the example

     g: [3, 8]  [2, 5],               3 34
                          g(x) = - x + .

                                      55

6. Assume h(x1) = h(x2), then
                                         4x1 - 11  4x2 - 11 (mod 15).

   Adding 11 to both sides yields
                                                4x1  4x2 (mod 15).

   Multiplying 4 to both sides leads to
                                              16x1  16x2 (mod 15),

   which simplifies to x1  x2 (mod 15). Therefore, h is one-to-one.
7. We find, for example, k(3)  k(6)  4 (mod 15). Hence, k is not one-to-one.
8. Assume h(n1) = h(n2). Since the image is either odd or even, we have to consider two

   cases.
       · If both h(n1) and h(n2) are odd, then
                                                      2n1 + 1 = 2n2 + 1,
          hence, n1 = n2.
       · If both h(n1) and h(n2) are even, then
                                                        -2n1 = -2n2,
          hence, n1 = n2.

   In both cases, we find n1 = n2. Therefore, h is one-to-one.

Section 6.4

1. We can use, for example, a straight line graph that connects the points (1, 2) and (3, 5).

This      leads  to  the  function  f : [1, 3]    [2, 5]  defined  by  f (x)  =  3  x  +  12 .
                                                                                 2

4. The midpoint of the interval (2, 9) is 211 , and its width is 7. The transformation of x to

x-  2      shifts    the  interval  to                                                    7              .

5. Let y = 3x + 11, then

                                                  x=      y - 11   ,

                                                          3

which is, of course, an element of the domain. Hence, g is onto.

6. It is obvious that the graphs y = 3x + 1 and y = 4x are increasing. For x  2, the y-values
   cover the range (-, 7). For x > 2, the y-values cover the range (8, ). Hence, the
   y-values in the interval [7, 8] are never used as images. For example, there is no x-value
   which would give f (x) = 215 . Therefore, f is not onto.

7. Let y  5x + 8 (mod 23). Then

                                        5x  y - 8 (mod 23).

Since 5-1  14 (mod 23), we find
                                 x  5-1(y - 8)  14(y - 8) (mod 23).

Therefore, h is onto.

8. No! Since v(n)  2, there does not exist n  N such that v(n) = 1.

9. No! Someone in the tree would have no daughter. She could be you, or your sisters, or
   one of their infant daughters, or someone higher up in the tree. For this individual y, we
   cannot find any x such that h1(x) = y, because this would make x a daughter of x.

3. Remember that h({0, 3, 4}) is a set, so we need to use a set notation. The answer is {4, 9}.

4. {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

5. Let y  f (C1  C2), we want to show that y  f (C1)  f (C2). Having y  f (C1  C2)
   means there exists x  C1  C2 such that f (x) = y. Now that x  C1  C2 requires x  C1
   and x  C2.

       · For x  C1, we find y = f (x)  f (C1).
       · For x  C2, we find y = f (x)  f (C2).
298                                           Appendix A Solutions to Hands-On Exercises

     We conclude that y = f (x) belongs to both f (C1) and f (C2). Thus, f (x)  f (C1)  f (C2),
     proving that f (C1  C2)  f (C1)  f (C2).

6. We want to find x such that

                                              x2 - x - 7 = 3.

     This is equivalent to solving the equation

                                              x2 - x - 10 = 0.

                                
                                1± 41                     k-1({3})
     Its  solutions  are  x  =      2  /  Q.  Therefore,            =  .

7. h-1({4}) = {0, 3, 6, 9, 12}; h-1({2}) = .

8. First, we want to prove that f -1(D1  D2)  f -1(D1)  f -1(D2). Let x  f -1(D1  D2),
   then f (x)  D1  D2. This means either f (x)  D1 and f (x)  D2.

       · For f (x)  D1, we find x  f -1(D1).
       · For f (x)  D2, we find x  f -1(D2).

   Since x belongs to both f -1(D1) and f -1(D2), we determine that x  f -1(D1)  f -1(D2).
   Therefore, f -1(D1  D2)  f -1(D1)  f -1(D2).

   Next, we want to prove that f -1(D1)  f -1(D2)  f -1(D1  D2). Let x  f -1(D1) 
   f -1(D2). Then x belongs to both f -1(D1) and x  f -1(D2).

       · For x  f -1(D1), we find f (x)  D1.
       · For x  f -1(D2), we find f (x)  D2.

     Hence, f (x) belongs to both D1 and D2, which means f (x)  D1  D2. Thus, x 
     f -1(D1  D2). We have proved that f -1(D1)  f -1(D2)  f -1(D1  D2). Together with
     f -1(D1 D2)  f -1(D1)f -1(D2), we conclude that f -1(D1 D2) = f -1(D1)f -1(D2).

2. g-1: (0, )  R, g-1(x) = ln x.

3. Following the same idea used in Example 6.6.3, we find

4. Let y  49x - 3 (mod 57). Interchanging x and y yields

                                              x  49y - 3 (mod 57).

     Hence,

                                y  49-1(x + 3)  7(x + 3) (mod 57).

     Therefore, h-1: Z57  Z57 is defined by

                                          h-1(x)  7(x + 3) (mod 57).

     Alternatively, we can also write h-1(x) = 7(x + 3) mod 57.

Hence, f  g: Z12  Z12 is defined by (f  g)(x)  11x + 5 (mod 12).

3. Since (f  g)(x) = f (g(x)) = 3g(x) + 2, the function f  g: R  R is defined by

            (f  g)(x) =                3x2 + 2           if x  5

                                       3(2x - 1) + 2 if x > 5

                                       = 3x2 + 2 if x  5
                                               6x - 1 if x > 5

4. The composite function f  g: Z  Z is defined by

                                       (f  g)(n) = n - 6 if n is even,
                                                           n + 2 if n is odd.

   This is how we obtained the answer. If n is even, then f (n) = n + 1 is odd, so we have to
   use the second branch in g to evaluate g(f (n)). We find, for even n, g(f (n)) = g(n + 1) =
   (n + 1) - 7 = n - 6. In a similar manner, when n is odd, f (n) = n - 1 is even, therefore
   g(f (n)) = g(n - 1) = (n - 1) + 3 = n + 2.

5. The composite function h  g is easy to obtain:

                                  h  g: Z  R, (h  g)(x) = |x| - 5 2.

   To compute g  h, we start with h, whose codomain is R. This means the result from h
   could be a real number. But the domain of g is Z, therefore g  h is not a well-defined
   composite function.

6. We find

             (f  g)(x) = f (g(x)) = eg(x) = eln x = x,
            (g  f )(x) = g(f (x)) = ln f (x) = ln ex = x.

Therefore, f and g are inverse functions of each other.

Section 7.2

   1. We find the following.

           · The relation R is reflexive since a  a for all a; hence, it cannot be irreflexive.
           · It is not symmetric, because 2  3 but 3 2.
           · Since a  b and b  a does imply that a = b, the relationR is antisymmetric.
           · Finally, it is transitive because a  b and b  c imply that a  c.

       The relation R is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.

   2. This is how the analysis may proceed:

           · Since a · a = a2 is always positive for any a  R (question: is it still true if A = R?),
              the relation S is reflexive, hence, it is not irreflexive.

           · Since ab = ba, it follows that whenever ab > 0, we also have ba > 0. Therefore, S is
              symmetric.

           · However, S is not antisymmetric. For example, 2 · 3 > 0 and 3 · 2 > 0, but 2 = 3.
           · Since ab > 0 only when a and b have the same sign, if we also have bc > 0, then c

              must have the same sign as b, hence the same sign as a, which in turn implies that
              ac > 0. Thus, S is transitive.

       The given relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

   3. The is how the analysis goes:

           · The relation T is reflexive because a | a for any positive integer a. Consequently, T
              is not irreflexive.

           · Since 2 | 6 but 6 2, we find T non-symmetric.
           · However, if a | b and b | a, we must have a = b, thus T is antisymmetric.
           · Finally, a | b and b | c do imply that a | c, hence T is transitive.

       The relation is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.

   4. The argument is similar to Hands-On Exercise 7.2.3, the relation is reflexive and transitive.

   5. The argument is similar to Hands-On Exercise 7.2.3, the relation R is reflexive, antisym-
       metric, and transitive.

   6. We obtain these conclusions:
Appendix A Solutions to Hands-On Exercises                                                    301

   · Anyone and himself (or herself) must have the same last name, hence W is reflexive,
      which immediately implies that W cannot be irreflexive.

   · If two people a and b have the same last name, then so are b and a. Thus, W is
      symmetric.

   · It is not antisymmetric. For example, John Doe and Jane Doe are two different
      persons having the same last name.

   · It is obvious that W is transitive.

This relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

Section 7.3

1. The proof is similar to Example 7.3.2.

2. The proof is similar to Example 7.3.2.

3. [0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].

4. [0], [1], [2], . . . , [n - 1].

5. Example 7.2.5: [1] = Q, and [x] = xQ, where x is any irrational number.
   Example 7.2.7: [0] and [1].
   Hands-On Exercise 7.2.2: [1] = R+, and [-1] = R-.
   Hands-On Exercise 7.2.6: each equivalence class consists of individuals with the same last
   name.

6. Since x - x = 0 is an integer, we find x  x, hence  is reflexive. If x  y, then x - y = m
   for some integer m. It follows that y - x = -(x - y) = -m, where -m is an integer.
   Hence, y  x as well, which means  is symmetric. If x  y and y  z, then x - y = m
   and y - z = n for some integers m and n. Then

                                          x - z = (x - y) + (y - z) = m + n

is an integer. Hence, x  z, which means  is transitive. Therefore,  is an equivalence
relation.

7. The proof is identical to that of Hands-On Exercise 7.3.6. However, -2.14 / [5.14], because
   5.14 - (-2.14) = 7.28 / Z.

8. Two points are related if they both lie on the same line y = 5x + b for some specific b.
   To obtain a more precise formulation, let (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) be the two points. Then
   y1 = 5x1 + b and y2 = 5x2 + b. Since b is fixed, we find b = y1 - 5x1 = y2 - 5x2. Therefore

                                       (x1, y1)  (x2, y2)  y1 - 5x1 = y2 - 5x2

is the relation induced by the partition.

it is clear that the relation S is an equivalence relation, and its equivalence classes are
[1] = {1, 4}, [2] = {2, 5, 6}, and [3] = {3}.

2. Let A and B denote the sets of people who attended the two games, then we are looking
   for the value of |A  B|. Since |A| = 72397, |B| = 69211 and |A  B| = 45713, we find

                    |A  B| = |A| + |B| - |A  B| = 72397 + 69211 - 45713 = 95895.

   Conclusion: 95895 different people attended the two games.

3. This time, we have |A| = 72397, |B| = 69211 and |A  B| = 93478, hence,

                    |A  B| = |A| + |B| - |A  B| = 72397 + 69211 - 93478 = 48130.

   Conclusion: 48130 people attended both games.

8. There are 9 · 10 · 10 = 900 natural numbers with 3 digits. Among them there are 10 of
   the form 44x, and 9 of the form x44, for some digit x. However, 444 is counted in both
   groups, so there are actually 10 + 9 - 1 = 18 integers with repeated 4s. Hence, the number
   of 3-digit natural numbers that do not have repeated 4s is 900 - 18 = 882.

9. (a) There are 26 choices each for the first two letters, and 10 choices for each of the
   remaining four digits. Hence, there are 262 · 104 choices for the PINs.
   (b) There are seven cases: from 0 to 6 digits following the first two letters, thus the total
   count is 262(1 + 10 + 102 + · · · + 106) = 262(107 - 1)/9.
   (c) Similar to (b), the total number of PINS equals to 262(102 + 103 + · · · + 106) =
   262 · 102(1 + 10 + · · · + 104) = 2602(105 - 1)/9.

8. A bridge hand is a 13-element subset, so it is a combination problem. The four spades can

     be chosen in        13  ways. The remaining nine cards must be selected from the remaining 39
                         4
                                                                                     39
     cards (the non-spades), hence they can be chosen in                             9   ways. Together, we determine

     that the number of bridge hands with exactly four spades is                             13     39  .  Note   that  the  upper
                                                                                             4      9

     numbers add up to 52, the total number of cards available, and the lower numbers add up

     to 13, the total number of cards selected.

9. The spades can be selected in                   13   ways, and the hearts in              13   ways. The remaining five
                                                   4                                         4

     cards must be selected from the remaining 26 cards other than spades and hearts, they

     can be selected in             26   ways. Hence, there are               13   13    526 . Again, take note that the
                                    5                                         4    4

     upper numbers add up to 52, and the lower numbers add up to 13.

10. Following the same approach in the last two hands-on exercises, we find the total number
     to be 4 3 3 3 13 13 13 13 , which can be written as 4 3 13 13 3.

11. There are      8     ways to choose the two blue balls.                   The other three balls must be either
                   2
                                                                                                                       11
     red or green, so we have to choose 3 balls from 6 + 5 = 11 balls. There are                                       3   choices.

     Together, there are            8    11  selections with exactly two blue balls.
                                    2    3

12. This is a combination problem, because we are selecting soda cans without worrying about

     the order of selection.

     (a) The 4 cans of Pepsi can be selected in                      8  ways. The other 6 cans can be selected from
                                                                     4
                                                              16
     the remaining 16 cans, and there are                     6      ways to do so. The total number of selections

     is therefore     8      16  .  Note     that  the  upper     numbers     add  up    to  24,  the      total  number   of  soda
                      4      6

     cans, and the lower numbers add up to 10, the number of cans selected.

     (b) "At least 4 cans of Pepsi" means we can choose from 4 to 8 cans. Following the
     argument used above, the number of selections is

                            8 16         +   8 16          +      8 16        +    8 16          +      8 16      ,

                            46               55                   64               73                   82

     which can be written as k=4 k 10-k 8 8 16 .
     (c) This time, the number of Pepsi is between 0 to 4 cans. The number of selections is

                            8 16         +   8 16          +      8 16        +    8 16          +      8 16      ,

                            0 10             19                   28               37                   46

     or simply k=0 k 10-k 4 8 16 .

     (d) This is a more elaborate version of the previous problems. The 3 Pepsi cans can be

     selected in   8     .   Now    we   have      to  pick  the  other    7  cans.    The   number        of  Sprite  could   vary
                   3

     from 0 to 3 cans. Once we have picked the Sprite cans, the other cans must be selected

     from the remaining 9 cans of Dr. Pepper and Mountain Dew. Thus, the total count is

                                    8 79                +    79         +     79         +   79            .

                                    3 07                     16               25             34

     Using the sigma notation, we can write                       8     k=0 k 7-k 3 7 9 .
                                                                  3

3. Since (2 - 5t)9 =     9      9    29-k (-5t)k ,  we  need   k  =   4,  which  implies  that  the  coefficient
                         k=0    k
             9
of t4 is     4  25 · (-5)4.

4. Since (3 - 2t3)8 = 8 8 k=0 k 38-k(-2t3)k =               8      8  38-k (-2)k t3k ,  we  need   3k  =  9,  or
   k = 3. The coefficient is 83 35(-2)3.                    k=0    k

5. Since                      39 9                          3k 9
                         x+ =                                     =

                                              k                            k

we need 9-2k = 0, which has no integral solutions. Hence, the constant term in (x+3/x)9
is zero.

For the second problem, since

                      3 10 10        10 (2x)10-k - 3 k 10 =                10 210-k(-3)kx10-2k,

   we need 10 - 2k = 0 or k = 5. The constant term is 105 25(-3)5.

   1. (a) False, because 7.2 is not between 6 and 7.
       (b) True, because 7.2 is between 6 and 8.
       (c) True, because 7.2 is between 7 and 9.
       (d) False, because the interval (7, 9 ] does not contain 7.
       (e) False, because the interval [ 5, 8) also contains decimal numbers.

   2. It is not clear whether 5 and/or 8 should be included or not. It would be improved if we
       say clearly whether the interval is open, closed or half-open. Better still, use mathematical
       notation. For instance, if it is a closed interval, say "Let A be the interval [5, 8]". If you
       prefer, you could even say "Let A be the closed interval [5, 8]".

9. By definition, a rational number can be written as a ratio of two integers. After multiplying
   the numerator by 7, we still have a ratio of two integers. Conversely, given any rational
   number x, we can multiply the denominator by 7, we obtain another rational number y
   such that 7y = x. Hence, the two sets 7Q and Q contain the same collection of rational
   numbers. In contrast, 0Q contains only one number, namely, 0. Therefore, 0Q = Q.

9. (a) Using a truth table, we find that the implication (pq)  (q r) is always true. Hence,
   no truth value of p would make (p  q)  (q  r) false.

   (b) From a truth table, we find that, (q  r)  (p  q) is false only when p is false. We
   can draw the same conclusion without using any truth table. An implication is false only
   when its hypothesis (in this case, q  r) is true and its conclusion (in this case, p  q) is
   false. For q  r to be true, we need both q and r to be true. Now q is true and p  q is
   false require p to be false.

9. The statement "a square must be a parallelogram" means, symbolically,

                        P QRS (P QRS is a square  P QRS is a parallelogram),

   but the statement "a square must not be a parallelogram" means

                     P QRS (P QRS is a square  P QRS is not a parallelogram).

   The second statement is not the negation of the first. The correct negation, in symbol, is

                         P QRS (P QRS is a square  P QRS is a parallelogram).

   In words, it means "there exists a square that is not a parallelogram."

   3. Let f (x) = x3 - 12x + 2. From the following chart

                                f (x) -14 12 18 13 2 -9 -14 -7 18

       we conclude there x3 -12x+2 = 0 has a solution between -4 and -3, another one between
       0 and 1, and a third one between 3 and 4. So it has at least three real solutions.
       Remark. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra asserts that a real polynomial of degree n
       has at most n real roots. Hence, the given equation has exactly three real solutions.

Section 3.3

   1. (a) We will prove the contrapositive of the given statement. That is, we will prove that if
       n is odd, then n2 is odd. If n is odd, we can write n = 2q + 1 for some integer q. Then
                                  n2 = (2q + 1)2 = 4q2 + 4q + 1 = 2(2q2 + 2q) + 1,

       where 2q2 + 2q is an integer. This shows that n2 is odd.
       (b) Suppose the given statement is false. That is, suppose n2 is even, but n is odd. Since
       n is odd, n = 2q + 1 for some integer q. Then

                                  n2 = (2q + 1)2 = 4q2 + 4q + 1 = 2(2q2 + 2q) + 1,

       where 2q2 + 2q is an integer. This shows that n2 is odd, which contradicts the assumption
       that n2 is even. Therefore, the given statement must be true.

   9. Suppose there exist some numbers a = b such that a2 + b2 = 2ab. Then
                                                0 = a2 - 2ab + b2 = (a - b)2

       would have implied that a = b. This contradicts the assumption that a = b. Therefore,
       a2 + b2 = 2ab.

  15. Suppose (p  q)  (p  q) is false for some logical statements p and q. For a disjunction
       to be false, we need
           · p  q to be false, and
           · p  q to be false.

       They in turn require
           · p to be true and q to be false, and
           · p to be true and q to be false.

       Having q false would imply q is true, which contradicts what we found. Therefore, the
       given logical formula is always true, hence a tautology.

Section 3.4

1. We proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the left-hand side of the identity reduces to
   13 = 1, and the right-hand side becomes 4 12·22 = 1. Hence, the identity holds when n = 1.
   Assume the identity holds when n = k for some integer k  1; that is, assume

                                      13 + 23 + 33 + · · · + k3 = k2(k + 1)2

   for some integer k  1. We want to show that it also holds when n = k + 1; that is, we
   want to show that

                              13 + 23 + 33 + · · · + (k + 1)3 = (k + 1)2(k + 2)2 .
                                                                                  4

   Using the inductive hypothesis, we find

             13 + 23 + 33 + · · · + (k + 1)3 = 13 + 23 + 33 + · · · + k3 + (k + 1)3

             = k2(k + 1)2 + (k + 1)3
                        4

                  (k + 1)2[k2 + 4(k + 1)]
             =

                                4

                  (k + 1)2(k2 + 4k + 4)
             =

                                4

             =  (k + 1)2(k + 2)2  .

Appendix B Answers to Selected Exercises                                                       313

     Therefore, the identity also holds when n = k + 1. This completes the induction.

Section 3.5

   1. We proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the product n(n+1)(n+2) becomes 1·2·3 = 6,
       which is obviously a multiple of 3. Hence, the claim holds when n = 1. Assume the claim
       holds when n = k for some integer k  1; that is, assume that k(k + 1)(k + 2) is a multiple
       of 3 for some integer k  1. Then we can write

                                            k(k + 1)(k + 2) = 3q

     for some integer q. We want to show that the claim is still valid when n = k + 1. That is,
     we want to show that (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3) is also a multiple of 3. So we want to find an
     integer Q such that

                                             (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3) = 3Q.

     We note that, using the inductive hypothesis,

                       (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3) = k(k + 1)(k + 2) + 3(k + 1)(k + 2)
                                                     = 3q + 3(k + 1)(k + 2)
                                                     = 3 [q + (k + 1)(k + 2)],

     where q + (k + 1)(k + 2) is an integer. Hence, (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3) is a multiple of 3. This
     completes the induction.

                 2n+3

Section 3.6

1. We proceed by induction on n. When n = 1, the left-hand side of the identity reduces

     to  F2   = 12  = 1,  and the right-hand side becomes F1F2    = 1 · 1 = 1.    Hence,  the identity

           1

     holds when n = 1. Assume the identity holds when n = k for some integer k  1; that is,

     assume

                                      F12 + F22 + F32 + · · · + Fk2 = FkFk+1

     for some integer k  1. We want to show that it also holds when n = k + 1; that is, we

     want to show that

                                 F12 + F22 + F32 + · · · + Fk+1 2 = Fk+1Fk+2.

     Using the inductive hypothesis, we find

                    F12 + F22 + F32 + · · · + Fk+1 2 = F12 + F22 + F32 + · · · + Fk2 + Fk+1 2
                                                           = FkFk+1 + Fk+1 2
                                                           = Fk+1(Fk + Fk+1)

                                                           = Fk+1Fk+2.

     Therefore, the identity also holds when n = k + 1. This completes the induction.

3. We claim that the subset (3, 5) does not have a smallest element. To see why, suppose it

                                            3<  3+x      < x < 5.

                                                      2

This  means  3+x  is     also  inside  the  interval  (3, 5),  and  is  smaller  than  x.  This  contradicts  the
               2

minimality of x. Thus, the interval (3, 5) does not have a smallest element. Consequently,

the interval (3, 5] is not well-ordered.

5. We know that N is well-ordered. Since 2N is a subset of N, and 2N is clearly nonempty,

                 n3 - n = (3q + 1)3 - (3q + 1) = 27q3 + 27q2 + 6q = 3(9q3 + 9q2 + 2q),

        where 9q3 + 9q2 + 2q is an integer.

         n3 - n = (3q + 2)3 - (3q + 2) = 27q3 + 54q2 + 33q + 6 = 3(9q3 + 18q2 + 11q + 2),

           where 9q3 + 18q2 + 11q + 2 is an integer.
     In all three cases, we have shown that n3 - n is a multiple of 3.

1. Since

                       -3 · (2n + 1) + 2 · (3n + 2) = 1,

we deduce that gcd(2n + 1, 3n + 2) = 1.

5. Let a, b, and c be positive integers such that a | c, b | c, and gcd(a, b) = 1. Then there
   exist integers x and y such that c = ax and c = by; and there exist integers s and t such
   that sa + tb = 1. It follows that

                       c = c · 1 = c(sa + tb) = csa + ctb.

Using c = ax and c = by, we find

                       c = csa + ctb = by · sa + ax · tb = ab(ys + xt),

where ys + xt is an integer. Thus, ab | c.

5. Assume x  10Z  15Z, then x  10Z and x  15Z. This means x is a multiple of both 10
   and 15. Consequently, x is a multiple of lcm(10, 15) = 30, which means x  30Z. Thus,
   10Z  15Z  30Z.

   Next, assume x  30Z, then x is a multiple of 30. Consequently, x is a multiple of 10, as
   well as a multiple of 15. This means x  10Z, and x  15Z. As a result, x  10Z  15Z.
   Thus, 30Z  10Z15Z. Together with 10Z15Z  30Z, we conclude that 10Z15Z = 30Z.

7. (a) When p is divided by 4, its remainder is 0, 1, 2, or 3. But p is odd, hence p is of the
   form 4k + 1 or 4k + 3 for some integer k. Since p  3, we also need k to be a nonnegative
   integer.

(b) When p is divided by 6, its remainder is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. But p is odd, hence p is of
the form 6k + 1, 6k + 3, or 6k + 5. We rule out the form 6k + 3 because this would make
p a multiple of 3. Hence, p is of the form 6k + 1 or 6k + 5 for some nonnegative integer k.

9. For a function to be well-defined, each row sum must be 1. For the function to be one-to-
   one, each column sum must be at most 1. For the function to be onto, each column sum
   must be at least 1 (hence no column sum is zero).

13. Let y  f (C1) - f (C2), we want to show that y  f (C1 - C2) as well. Since y  f (C1) -
     f (C2), we know there exists x  A such that f (x) = y. Having y  f (C1)-f (C -2) means
     y  f (C1) but y / f (C2). Hence, x  C1 but x / C2. In other words, x  C1 - C2. This
     leads to y = f (x)  f (C1 -C2). This completes the proof that f (C1)-f (C2)  f (C1 -C2).

7. (a) A is not reflexive because (X, X) / A if X = .

     (b) A is not irreflexive because (, )  A.

     (c) No. For example, consider S = {a, b, c}, X = {a}, Y = {b}, and Z = {a, c}. Then
     (X, Y )  A, (Y, Z)  A, but (X, Z) / A.

1. (a) The equivalence classes are of the form {3 - k, 3 + k} for some integer k. For instance,
   [3] = {3}, [2] = {2, 4}, [1] = {1, 5}, and [-5] = {-5, 11}.

   (b) There are three equivalence classes: [0] = 3Z, [1] = 1 + 3Z, and [2] = 2 + 3Z.

    (d) [X] = {(X  T )  Y | Y  (T )}. In other words, S  X if S contains the same
    element in X  T , plus possibly some elements not in T .

5. (a) Yes, with [(a, b)] = {(x, y) | y = x + k for some constant k}. In other words, the
   equivalence classes are the straight lines of the form y = x + k for some constant k.

   (b) No. For example, (2, 5)  (3, 5) and (3, 5)  (3, 7), but (2, 5)  (3, 7). Hence, the
   relation  is not transitive.

7.  We  find  [0] =  12 Z = { n2  | n  Z},  and                        [ 14 ] =                                    1  +                                     12 Z = { 2n+1 4                                                          | n  Z}.

3. Let a  B, since B  A, we also find a  A. Since (A, ) is a poset, the relation
   on A is reflexive, hence a a. This shows that is still reflexive when restricted to B.
   Antisymmetry and transitivity are proved with a similar argument.

5. (b) The Hasse diagram is shown below.
