          1.1-1.2: Logic in Everyday Life, Sets and Venn Diagrams - SOLUTIONS

Class Activities

1. Discuss each statement and decide which are propositions. Circle
    or highlight them.
    a. Are you hungry?
    b. Janae was nominated for student council president.
    c. Four pounds less.
    d. 7 + 8 = 33
    e. I have two siblings.

2. A proposition is given, represented by the letter p. Write the wording for the negation and
    double negation.

    p: Hannah eats apples.

   not p: Hannah does not eat apples
   not not p: Hanna refuses to not eat apples (you can be creative with this
   one)

3. More Negations. Read the following and decide whether logging will continue. "The
    House failed to overturn a veto on a bill that would stop logging."

   Logging would continue

    (The bill would stop logging. The veto would continue logging. Overturning
    the veto would stop logging. Failing to overturn the veto continues logging.)

4. On this California ballot measure, what's the result of a "yes" vote?

Ballot question title: Redistricting. State Senate Districts. Referendum.
Ballot question text: A "Yes" vote approves, and a "No" vote rejects, new State Senate
districts drawn by the Citizens Redistricting Commission. If the new districts are rejected,
the State Senate district boundary lines will be adjusted by officials supervised by the
California Supreme Court.
(State Senate districts are revised every 10 years following the federal census.)

In California's Proposition 40 (2012), it's likely that some voters thought
a "yes" vote meant approving a new way of drawing Senate district
boundaries when in fact, it meant to keep the existing method.
(If the new districts are rejected, the lines will be adjusted)

    answer.

a. All students like coffee.

   All students don't like coffee or some students don't like coffee.

b. No students like to sing.

   Some students like to sing.

6. Determine whether each "and" statement is true or false.

9. Identify the hypothesis and conclusion of each conditional statement.

a. If you can see the stars, then it is night.

   Hypothesis: You can see the stars, Conclusion: It is night.

b. You'll win big if you play the lottery.

   Hypothesis: You play the lottery, Conclusion: You'll win big.

c. If elephants fly, then fish don't swim.

   Hypothesis: Elephants fly, Conclusion: Fish don't swim.

10. Determine whether each "if...then" statement is true or false.

   a. If a figure is a square, then it has four equal sides. true
   b. If cows can fly, then eagles can fly. true
   c. If the sky is purple, dogs are not pets. true
   d. If horses are mammals, then horses have two legs. false

11. Write the converse, inverse, and contrapositive for the conditional statement:
    Original Statement: If you perform well tomorrow, then you get a cash bonus.

   a. Converse: If you got a cash bonus, you performed well.

b. Inverse: If you didn't perform well, you didn't get a cash bonus.

c. Contrapositive: If you didn't get a cash bonus, you didn't perform well.

d. Which pairs of statements are equivalent to each other? The original statement
   and contrapositive are equivalent. The converse and inverse are
   equivalent.

12. Compound Statements: Some courses at PCC and other colleges have complex sets of
    prerequisites. For each class, list all the minimum ways a student could meet the
    prerequisites.

a. ART275 Printmaking II.

    Prerequisites: ART 272 or ART 273 or ART 274

   3 possible ways (to meet the minimum prerequisite)
       · Take ART 272 or
       · Take ART 273 or
       · Take ART 274

b. AD256 Advanced Counseling and Addiction.
    Prerequisites: AD 160 or (AD 150 and AD 151)

   2 possible ways (to meet the minimum prerequisite)
       · Take AD 160 or
       · Take AD 150 and AD 151

c. BA285 Human Relations-Organizations.

    Prerequisite: (WR 115 and RD 115) or IRW 115 and MTH 20 or equivalent

    placement. Note: IRW 115 is integrated reading and writing.

   This could be clearer with more parentheses, but assume math is
   required.
   2 possible ways (to meet the minimum prerequisite)

       · Take WR 115 and RD 115 and MTH 20 or
       · Take IRW 115 and MTH 20 or
       · Note: There are more options if you consider placing above

           each class:

                o Take WR 115 and RD 115 and place higher than MTH 20 or
                o Place higher than WR 115, take RD 115 and MTH 20 or
                o Take WR 115, place higher than RD 115 and MTH 20 or
                o Place higher than IRW 115 and MTH 20

d. CIS277A Data Analytics.
    Prerequisites: CIS 125D or CIS 275, and (WR 115 and RD 115) or IRW 115 and MTH 20
    or equivalent placement. You can build off your last answer.

        · Take CIS 125D along with the 2 possibilities above
        · Take CIS 275 along with the 2 possibilities above.
        · If you included placing out of classes there would be 8 more

            possibilities

13. Pizza Venn Diagrams

Let's continue the last example with P representing pepperoni, H representing ham, and M
representing mushrooms. Shade or color in the appropriate area(s) for each pizza on the
Venn diagrams below.

Pepperoni &              Cheese  Veggie                    Supreme

Qualified Propositions

14. Draw a Venn diagram for each categorical proposition. Then write on the line whether the
    sets are disjoint, overlapping, or one is a subset of the other.
                                                                                 Relationship between the Sets

a. Some bikes are orange.              _____Overlapping______________

15. Interpreting values on a Venn diagram

A survey was taken to see which professional sports were
watched by students. Let F represent football, B represent
basketball, and H represent hockey.

Answer the following questions (use complete sentences).
Show any calculations that were used.

a. How many students participated in the survey?

    65 + 42 + 53 + 24 + 25 + 19 + 37 + 35 =300
   300 students took the survey.

b. How many students watched basketball?

    42 + 53 + 25 + 19 = 139
    139 students watched basketball.

c. How many students watched only one of the sports?

     65 + 53 + 37 = 155
     155 students watched only one of the sports.

d. How many students watched at least two sports?

     24 + 42 + 19 + 25 = 110
   110 students watched at least two of the three sports.

e. How many students didn't watch hockey?

    300 - (24 + 25 + 19 + 37) = 195 OR 35 + 65 + 42 + 53 = 195
   195 students didn't watch hockey.

e. How many students watched football or hockey? Can you find this 2 different ways?

    65 + 42 + 24 + 25 + 37 + 19 = 212 or 300 - 53 - 35
   212 students watched football or hockey (remember the inclusive or)

f. How many students watched football and hockey, but not basketball?

(this one can be found directly from the diagram)
         24 students watched football and hockey, but not basketball.

16. Challenge Problem - read the wording very carefully.

150 people attending a concert were asked if they played piano, guitar, or drums.

10 could play all three.
73 could play guitar.
18 couldn't play any of these instruments.
21 could play piano and drums.
49 could play at least two of the instruments.
13 could play piano and guitar but not drums.
69 could play drums or guitar but not piano.

Let P represent piano, G represent guitar, and D represent drums.
         Write a description in each area.

Calculate and fill in the values for all eight regions.

If given the "all" value, enter in the center.

If given the "none" value, enter outside of the circles.

Next, look for information for any that are only two of the three (small areas
connected to center):

Look for information for
two of three (but doesn't
exclude the third). For
this type, you have to
subtract the center value.

Cara Lee  Page 8
MTH 105                        Chapter 1: Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving

Next, we can do the
"at least two" (four center
areas) by subtracting the
three known values.

After that, look for one
instrument that has values
in three of the four areas,
subtracting them.

The three areas from
drums and guitar that are
bordering the piano circle
represent "drums or
guitar, not piano."
Subtract the two known values to find the "only drums."

When just the "only piano"                               Page 9
area remains, subtract all of
the other values from the
total.

NOTE: In general, a
process of elimination is
used. The given
information isn't always the
same types as this problem,
but will be enough to work
through area by area until
all have values assigned.
