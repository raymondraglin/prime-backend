About the Author/Editor

                              David Lippman received his master's degree in mathematics from
                              Western Washington University and has been teaching at Pierce
                              College since Fall 2000.

                              David has been a long time advocate of open learning, open materials,
                              and basically any idea that will reduce the cost of education for
                              students. It started by supporting the college's calculator rental
                              program, and running a book loan scholarship program. Eventually the
                              frustration with the escalating costs of commercial text books and the
                              online homework systems that charged for access led to action.

   First, David developed IMathAS, open source online math homework software that runs
   WAMAP.org and MyOpenMath.com. Through this platform, he became an integral part of a
   vibrant sharing and learning community of teachers from around Washington State that
   support and contribute to WAMAP. These pioneering efforts, supported by dozens of other
   dedicated faculty and financial support from the Transition Math Project, have led to a
   system used by thousands of students every quarter, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars
   over comparable commercial offerings.

   David continued further and wrote the first edition of this textbook, Math in Society, after
   being frustrated by students having to pay $100+ for a textbook for a terminal course.
   Together with Melonie Rasmussen, he co-authored PreCalculus: An Investigation of
   Functions in 2010.

Preface

   The traditional high school and college mathematics sequence leading from algebra up
   through calculus could leave one with the impression that mathematics is all about algebraic
   manipulations. This book is an exploration of the wide world of mathematics, of which
   algebra is only one small piece. The topics were chosen because they provide glimpses into
   other ways of thinking mathematically, and because they have interesting applications to
   everyday life. Together, they highlight algorithmic, graphical, algebraic, statistical, and
   analytic approaches to solving problems.

   This book is available online for free, in both Word and PDF format. You are free to change
   the wording, add materials and sections or take them away. I welcome feedback, comments
   and suggestions for future development. If you add a section, chapter or problems, I would
   love to hear from you and possibly add your materials so everyone can benefit.

New in This Edition

   Edition 2 has been heavily revised to introduce a new layout that emphasizes core concepts
   and definitions, and examples. Based on experience using the first edition for three years as
   the primarily learning materials in a fully online course, concepts that were causing students
   confusion were clarified, and additional examples were added. New "Try it Now" problems
   were introduced, which give students the opportunity to test out their understanding in a
   zero-stakes format. Edition 2.0 also added four new chapters.

   Edition 2.1 was a typo and clarification update on the first 14 chapters, and added 2
   additional new chapters. No page or exercise numbers changed on the first 14 chapters.
   Edition 2.2 was a typo revision. A couple new exploration exercises were added.
   Edition 2.3 and 2.4 were typo revisions.
   Edition 2.5 added a chapter on Logic, as well as typo revisions.

Supplements

   The Washington Open Course Library (OCL) project helped fund the creation of a full
   course package for this book, which contains the following features:

        · Suggested syllabus for a fully online course
        · Possible syllabi for an on-campus course
        · Online homework for most chapters (algorithmically generated, free response)
        · Online quizzes for most chapters (algorithmically generated, free response)
        · Written assignments and discussion forum assignments for most chapters

   The course shell was built for the IMathAS online homework platform, and is available for
   Washington State faculty at www.wamap.org and mirrored for others at
   www.myopenmath.com. The course shell was designed to follow Quality Matters (QM)
   guidelines, but has not yet been formally reviewed.

Problem Solving

     In previous math courses, you've no doubt run into the infamous "word problems."
     Unfortunately, these problems rarely resemble the type of problems we actually encounter in
     everyday life. In math books, you usually are told exactly which formula or procedure to
     use, and are given exactly the information you need to answer the question. In real life,
     problem solving requires identifying an appropriate formula or procedure, and determining
     what information you will need (and won't need) to answer the question.

   In this chapter, we will review several basic but powerful algebraic ideas: percents, rates,
   and proportions. We will then focus on the problem solving process, and explore how to use
   these ideas to solve problems where we don't have perfect information.

Percents
   In the 2004 vice-presidential debates, Edwards's claimed that US forces have suffered "90%
   of the coalition casualties" in Iraq. Cheney disputed this, saying that in fact Iraqi security
   forces and coalition allies "have taken almost 50 percent" of the casualties1. Who is correct?
   How can we make sense of these numbers?

Percent literally means "per 100," or "parts per hundred." When we write 40%, this is
equivalent to the fraction 40 or the decimal 0.40. Notice that 80 out of 200 and 10 out of

                               100
                             80 10 40
25 are also 40%, since = = .
                            200 25 100

Example 1
     243 people out of 400 state that they like dogs. What percent is this?

243         60.75
= 0= .6075         . This is 60.75%.
400         100

Notice that the percent can be found from the equivalent decimal by moving the decimal
point two places to the right.

Example 2                                  b) 0.02 c) 2.35
     Write each as a percent: a) 1
                                        4

a) 1 = 0.25 = 25%  b) 0.02 = 2%                              c) 2.35 = 235%

           Percents
           If we have a part that is some percent of a whole, then
            percent = part , or equivalently= , part percent  whole

                        whole
           To do the calculations, we write the percent as a decimal.

  Example 3
        The sales tax in a town is 9.4%. How much tax will you pay on a $140 purchase?

        Here, $140 is the whole, and we want to find 9.4% of $140. We start by writing the percent
        as a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left (which is equivalent to
        dividing by 100). We can then compute:

= tax 0= .094(140) $13.16 in tax.

  Example 4
        In the news, you hear "tuition is expected to increase by 7% next year." If tuition this year
        was $1200 per quarter, what will it be next year?

        The tuition next year will be the current tuition plus an additional 7%, so it will be 107% of
        this year's tuition:
        $1200(1.07) = $1284.

        Alternatively, we could have first calculated 7% of $1200: $1200(0.07) = $84.

        Notice this is not the expected tuition for next year (we could only wish). Instead, this is the
        expected increase, so to calculate the expected tuition, we'll need to add this change to the
        previous year's tuition:
        $1200 + $84 = $1284.

        Try it Now 1
        A TV originally priced at $799 is on sale for 30% off. There is then a 9.2% sales tax. Find
        the price after including the discount and sales tax.

  Example 5
        The value of a car dropped from $7400 to $6800 over the last year. What percent decrease is
        this?

        To compute the percent change, we first need to find the dollar value change: $6800-$7400
        = -$600. Often we will take the absolute value of this amount, which is called the absolute
        change: -600 = 600 .
                                                                                               Problem Solving 3

     Since we are computing the decrease relative to the starting value, we compute this percent
     out of $7400:
      600
      = 0= .081 8.1% decrease. This is called a relative change.
      7400

         Absolute and Relative Change
         Given two quantities,
         Absolute change = ending quantity - starting quantity
         Relative change: absolute change

                               starting quantity

         Absolute change has the same units as the original quantity.
         Relative change gives a percent change.
         The starting quantity is called the base of the percent change.

     The base of a percent is very important. For example, while Nixon was president, it was
     argued that marijuana was a "gateway" drug, claiming that 80% of marijuana smokers went
     on to use harder drugs like cocaine. The problem is, this isn't true. The true claim is that
     80% of harder drug users first smoked marijuana. The difference is one of base: 80% of
     marijuana smokers using hard drugs, vs. 80% of hard drug users having smoked marijuana.
     These numbers are not equivalent. As it turns out, only one in 2,400 marijuana users actually
     go on to use harder drugs2.

Example 6
     There are about 75 QFC supermarkets in the U.S. Albertsons has about 215 stores. Compare
     the size of the two companies.

     When we make comparisons, we must ask first whether an absolute or relative comparison.
     The absolute difference is 215 - 75 = 140. From this, we could say "Albertsons has 140
     more stores than QFC." However, if you wrote this in an article or paper, that number does
     not mean much. The relative difference may be more meaningful. There are two different
     relative changes we could calculate, depending on which store we use as the base:

     Using QFC as the base, 140 = 1.867 .
                                    75

     This tells us Albertsons is 186.7% larger than QFC.
     Using Albertsons as the base, 140 = 0.651.

                                          215
     This tells us QFC is 65.1% smaller than Albertsons.

      2 http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesDamnedLiesAndStatistics
     4

     Notice both of these are showing percent differences. We could also calculate the size of
     Albertsons relative to QFC: 215 = 2.867 , which tells us Albertsons is 2.867 times the size

                                          75
     of QFC. Likewise, we could calculate the size of QFC relative to Albertsons: 75 = 0.349 ,

                                                                                                     215
     which tells us that QFC is 34.9% of the size of Albertsons.

Example 7
     Suppose a stock drops in value by 60% one week, then increases in value the next week by
     75%. Is the value higher or lower than where it started?

     To answer this question, suppose the value started at $100. After one week, the value
     dropped by 60%:
     $100 - $100(0.60) = $100 - $60 = $40.

     In the next week, notice that base of the percent has changed to the new value, $40.
     Computing the 75% increase:
     $40 + $40(0.75) = $40 + $30 = $70.

     In the end, the stock is still $30 lower, or $30 = 30% lower, valued than it started.
                                                         $100

     The U.S. federal debt at the end of 2001 was $5.77 trillion, and grew to $6.20 trillion by the
     end of 2002. At the end of 2005 it was $7.91 trillion, and grew to $8.45 trillion by the end of
     20063. Calculate the absolute and relative increase for 2001-2002 and 2005-2006. Which
     year saw a larger increase in federal debt?

Example 8
     A Seattle Times article on high school graduation rates reported "The number of schools
     graduating 60 percent or fewer students in four years - sometimes referred to as "dropout
     factories" - decreased by 17 during that time period. The number of kids attending schools
     with such low graduation rates was cut in half."

     a) Is the "decrease by 17" number a useful comparison?

     b) Considering the last sentence, can we conclude that the number of "dropout factories" was
        originally 34?

      3 http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist07z1.xls
                                                                                               Problem Solving 5

     a) This number is hard to evaluate, since we have no basis for judging whether this is a larger
        or small change. If the number of "dropout factories" dropped from 20 to 3, that'd be a
        very significant change, but if the number dropped from 217 to 200, that'd be less of an
        improvement.

     b) The last sentence provides relative change which helps put the first sentence in
        perspective. We can estimate that the number of "dropout factories" was probably
        previously around 34. However, it's possible that students simply moved schools rather
        than the school improving, so that estimate might not be fully accurate.

Example 9
     In the 2004 vice-presidential debates, Edwards's claimed that US forces have suffered "90%
     of the coalition casualties" in Iraq. Cheney disputed this, saying that in fact Iraqi security
     forces and coalition allies "have taken almost 50 percent" of the casualties. Who is correct?

     Without more information, it is hard for us to judge who is correct, but we can easily
     conclude that these two percents are talking about different things, so one does not
     necessarily contradict the other. Edward's claim was a percent with coalition forces as the
     base of the percent, while Cheney's claim was a percent with both coalition and Iraqi security
     forces as the base of the percent. It turns out both statistics are in fact fairly accurate.

     Try it Now 3
     In the 2012 presidential elections, one candidate argued that "the president's plan will cut
     $716 billion from Medicare, leading to fewer services for seniors," while the other candidate
     rebuts that "our plan does not cut current spending and actually expands benefits for seniors,
     while implementing cost saving measures." Are these claims in conflict, in agreement, or not
     comparable because they're talking about different things?

     We'll wrap up our review of percents with a couple cautions. First, when talking about a
     change of quantities that are already measured in percents, we have to be careful in how we
     describe the change.

Example 10
     A politician's support increases from 40% of voters to 50% of voters. Describe the change.

     We could describe this using an absolute change: 50% - 40% = 10% . Notice that since the
     original quantities were percents, this change also has the units of percent. In this case, it is
     best to describe this as an increase of 10 percentage points.

                                                                    10%
     In contrast, we could compute the percent change: = 0= .25 25% increase. This is the

                                                                    40%
     relative change, and we'd say the politician's support has increased by 25%.
     6

     Lastly, a caution against averaging percents.

Example 11
     A basketball player scores on 40% of 2-point field goal attempts, and on 30% of 3-point of
     field goal attempts. Find the player's overall field goal percentage.

     It is very tempting to average these values, and claim the overall average is 35%, but this is
     likely not correct, since most players make many more 2-point attempts than 3-point
     attempts. We don't actually have enough information to answer the question. Suppose the
     player attempted 200 2-point field goals and 100 3-point field goals. Then they made
     200(0.40) = 80 2-point shots and 100(0.30) = 30 3-point shots. Overall, they made 110 shots
     out of 300, for a 110 = 0.367 = 36.7% overall field goal percentage.

 Proportions and Rates
     If you wanted to power the city of Seattle using wind power, how many windmills would you
     need to install? Questions like these can be answered using rates and proportions.

         Rates
         A rate is the ratio (fraction) of two quantities.
         A unit rate is a rate with a denominator of one.

Example 12

Your car can drive 300 miles on a tank of 15 gallons. Express this as a rate.

Expressed as a rate, 300 miles . We can divide to find a unit rate: 20 miles , which we could
            15 gallons                                 1gallon

also write as 20 miles , or just 20 miles per gallon.

Proportion Equation
A proportion equation is an equation showing the equivalence of two rates or ratios.

Example 13
     Solve the proportion 5 = x for the unknown value x.
                               36

     This proportion is asking us to find a fraction with denominator 6 that is equivalent to the
     fraction 5 . We can solve this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6, giving

                3
      x = 5  6 = 10 .

Example 14
     A map scale indicates that ½ inch on the map corresponds with 3 real miles. How many
     miles apart are two cities that are 2 1 inches apart on the map?
                                                4

We can set up a proportion by setting equal two map inches rates, and introducing a
                                                            real miles

variable, x, to represent the unknown quantity - the mile distance between the cities.

1 map inch 2 1 map inches

                                  Multiply both sides by x

     27 1
=x = 13 miles

      22

Many proportion problems can also be solved using dimensional analysis, the process of
multiplying a quantity by rates to change the units.

Example 15
     Your car can drive 300 miles on a tank of 15 gallons. How far can it drive on 40 gallons?

We could certainly answer this question using a proportion: 300 miles = x miles .
                                                                          15gallons 40gallons

However, we earlier found that 300 miles on 15 gallons gives a rate of 20 miles per gallon.

If we multiply the given 40 gallon quantity by this rate, the gallons unit "cancels" and we're

left with a number of miles:

40gallons  20 miles = 40gallons  20 miles = 800 miles
            gallon             1  gallon

Notice if instead we were asked "how many gallons are needed to drive 50 miles?" we could

answer this question by inverting the 20 mile per gallon rate so that the miles unit cancels and

we're left with gallons:

50 miles  1gallon = 50 miles  1gallon = 50gallons = 2.5gallons
            20 miles      1 20 miles      20
8

Dimensional analysis can also be used to do unit conversions. Here are some unit
conversions for reference.

    Unit Conversions                     1 yard (yd) = 3 feet (ft)
    Length
    1 foot (ft) = 12 inches (in)         100 centimeters (cm) = 1 meter
    1 mile = 5,280 feet                  2.54 centimeters (cm) = 1 inch
    1000 millimeters (mm) = 1 meter (m)
    1000 meters (m) = 1 kilometer (km)

    Weight and Mass                      1 ton = 2000 pounds
    1 pound (lb) = 16 ounces (oz)        1000 grams = 1kilogram (kg)
    1000 milligrams (mg) = 1 gram (g)
    1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds (on earth)

    Capacity                             1 pint = 2 cups
    1 cup = 8 fluid ounces (fl oz)*      1 gallon = 4 quarts = 16 cups
    1 quart = 2 pints = 4 cups
    1000 milliliters (ml) = 1 liter (L)

    *Fluid ounces are a capacity measurement for liquids. 1 fluid ounce  1 ounce (weight) for water only.

Example 16
     A bicycle is traveling at 15 miles per hour. How many feet will it cover in 20 seconds?

To answer this question, we need to convert 20 seconds into feet. If we know the speed of

the bicycle in feet per second, this question would be simpler. Since we don't, we will need

to do additional unit conversions. We will need to know that 5280 ft = 1 mile. We might

start by converting the 20 seconds into hours:

20seconds  1minute  1hour = 1 hour              Now we can multiply by the 15 miles/hr
              60seconds 60 minutes 180

1 hour  15miles = 1 mile                        Now we can convert to feet
180  1hour 12

1 mile  5280feet = 440feet
12   1mile

We could have also done this entire calculation in one long set of products:
20seconds  1minute  1hour  15miles  5280feet = 440feet

               60seconds 60 minutes 1hour 1mile

     Notice that with the miles per gallon example, if we double the miles driven, we double the
     gas used. Likewise, with the map distance example, if the map distance doubles, the real-life
     distance doubles. This is a key feature of proportional relationships, and one we must
     confirm before assuming two things are related proportionally.

Example 17
     Suppose you're tiling the floor of a 10 ft by 10 ft room, and find that 100 tiles will be needed.
     How many tiles will be needed to tile the floor of a 20 ft by 20 ft room?

     In this case, while the width the room has doubled, the area has quadrupled. Since the
     number of tiles needed corresponds with the area of the floor, not the width, 400 tiles will be
     needed. We could find this using a proportion based on the areas of the rooms:
     2 100 tiles = 2 n tiles
      100ft 400ft

     Other quantities just don't scale proportionally at all.

Example 18
     Suppose a small company spends $1000 on an advertising campaign, and gains 100 new
     customers from it. How many new customers should they expect if they spend $10,000?

     While it is tempting to say that they will gain 1000 new customers, it is likely that additional
     advertising will be less effective than the initial advertising. For example, if the company is
     a hot tub store, there are likely only a fixed number of people interested in buying a hot tub,
     so there might not even be 1000 people in the town who would be potential customers.

     Sometimes when working with rates, proportions, and percents, the process can be made
     more challenging by the magnitude of the numbers involved. Sometimes, large numbers are
     just difficult to comprehend.

Example 19
     Compare the 2010 U.S. military budget of $683.7 billion to other quantities.

     Here we have a very large number, about $683,700,000,000 written out. Of course,
     imagining a billion dollars is very difficult, so it can help to compare it to other quantities.

     If that amount of money was used to pay the salaries of the 1.4 million Walmart employees
     in the U.S., each would earn over $488,000.

     There are about 300 million people in the U.S. The military budget is about $2,200 per
     person.

     If you were to put $683.7 billion in $100 bills, and count out 1 per second, it would take 216
     years to finish counting it.

Example 20
     Compare the electricity consumption per capita in China to the rate in Japan.

     To address this question, we will first need data. From the CIA4 website we can find the
     electricity consumption in 2011 for China was 4,693,000,000,000 KWH (kilowatt-hours), or
     4.693 trillion KWH, while the consumption for Japan was 859,700,000,000, or 859.7 billion
     KWH. To find the rate per capita (per person), we will also need the population of the two
     countries. From the World Bank5, we can find the population of China is 1,344,130,000, or
     1.344 billion, and the population of Japan is 127,817,277, or 127.8 million.

     Computing the consumption per capita for each country:
     China: 4,693,000,000,000 KWH  3491.5 KWH per person

                  1,344,130,000 people
     Japan: 859,700,000,000 KWH  6726 KWH per person

                127,817,277 people

     While China uses more than 5 times the electricity of Japan overall, because the population
     of Japan is so much smaller, it turns out Japan uses almost twice the electricity per person
     compared to China.

 Geometry
     Geometric shapes, as well as area and volumes, can often be important in problem solving.

Example 21
     You are curious how tall a tree is, but don't have any way to climb it. Describe a method for
     determining the height.

     There are several approaches we could take. We'll use one based on triangles, which
     requires that it's a sunny day. Suppose the tree is casting a shadow, say 15 ft long. I can
     then have a friend help me measure my own shadow. Suppose I am 6 ft tall, and cast a 1.5 ft
     shadow. Since the triangle formed by the tree and its shadow has the same angles as the
     triangle formed by me and my shadow, these triangles are called similar triangles and their
     sides will scale proportionally. In other words, the ratio of height to width will be the same
     in both triangles. Using this, we can find the height of the tree, which we'll denote by h:

         6ft tall = h ft tall
     1.5ft shadow 15ft shadow

     Multiplying both sides by 15, we get h = 60. The tree is about 60 ft tall.

Example 22
     If a 12 inch diameter pizza requires 10 ounces of dough, how much dough is needed for a 16
     inch pizza?

To answer this question, we need to consider how the weight of the dough will scale. The
weight will be based on the volume of the dough. However, since both pizzas will be about
the same thickness, the weight will scale with the area of the top of the pizza. We can find
the area of each pizza using the formula for area of a circle, A =  r2 :
A 12" pizza has radius 6 inches, so the area will be  62 = about 113 square inches.
A 16" pizza has radius 8 inches, so the area will be  82 = about 201 square inches.

Notice that if both pizzas were 1 inch thick, the volumes would be 113 in3 and 201 in3
respectively, which are at the same ratio as the areas. As mentioned earlier, since the
thickness is the same for both pizzas, we can safely ignore it.

We can now set up a proportion to find the weight of the dough for a 16" pizza:

2 10ounces = 2 x ounces  Multiply both sides by 201
113in  201in

=x 201 10 = about 17.8 ounces of dough for a 16" pizza.
           113

It is interesting to note that while the diameter is 16 = 1.33 times larger, the dough required,

                                                           12
which scales with area, is 1.332 = 1.78 times larger.

     marshmallows. The regular marshmallow has 25
     calories. How many calories will the jumbo
     marshmallow have?

We would expect the calories to scale with         Photo courtesy Christopher Danielson
volume. Since the marshmallows have cylindrical
shapes, we can use that formula to find the
volume. From the grid in the image, we can
estimate the radius and height of each
marshmallow.

The regular marshmallow appears to have a diameter of about 3.5 units, giving a radius of

1.75 units, and a height of about 3.5 units. The volume is about  (1.75)2 (3.5) = 33.7 units3 .

The jumbo marshmallow appears to have a diameter of about 5.5 units, giving a radius of

2.75 units, and a height of about 5 units. The volume is about  (2.75)2 (5) = 118.8 units3 .

We could now set up a proportion, or use rates. The regular marshmallow has 25 calories for
33.7 cubic units of volume. The jumbo marshmallow will have:
118.8 units3  3 25 calories = 88.1 calories

                33.7 units

It is interesting to note that while the diameter and height are about 1.5 times larger for the
jumbo marshmallow, the volume and calories are about 1.53 = 3.375 times larger.

Problem Solving and Estimating
   Finally, we will bring together the mathematical tools we've reviewed, and use them to
   approach more complex problems. In many problems, it is tempting to take the given
   information, plug it into whatever formulas you have handy, and hope that the result is what
   you were supposed to find. Chances are, this approach has served you well in other math
   classes.
                                                                                              Problem Solving 13

     This approach does not work well with real life problems. Instead, problem solving is best
     approached by first starting at the end: identifying exactly what you are looking for. From
     there, you then work backwards, asking "what information and procedures will I need to find
     this?" Very few interesting questions can be answered in one mathematical step; often times
     you will need to chain together a solution pathway, a series of steps that will allow you to
     answer the question.

         Problem Solving Process
         1. Identify the question you're trying to answer.
         2. Work backwards, identifying the information you will need and the relationships

             you will use to answer that question.
         3. Continue working backwards, creating a solution pathway.
         4. If you are missing necessary information, look it up or estimate it. If you have

             unnecessary information, ignore it.
         5. Solve the problem, following your solution pathway.

     In most problems we work, we will be approximating a solution, because we will not have
     perfect information. We will begin with a few examples where we will be able to
     approximate the solution using basic knowledge from our lives.

Example 24
     How many times does your heart beat in a year?

     This question is asking for the rate of heart beats per year. Since a year is a long time to
     measure heart beats for, if we knew the rate of heart beats per minute, we could scale that
     quantity up to a year. So the information we need to answer this question is heart beats per
     minute. This is something you can easily measure by counting your pulse while watching a
     clock for a minute.
     Suppose you count 80 beats in a minute. To convert this beats per year:

      80 beats  60 minutes  24 hours  365 days = 42,048,000 beats per year
     1 minute 1 hour 1 day 1 year

Example 25
     How thick is a single sheet of paper? How much does it weigh?

     While you might have a sheet of paper handy, trying to measure it would be tricky. Instead
     we might imagine a stack of paper, and then scale the thickness and weight to a single sheet.
     If you've ever bought paper for a printer or copier, you probably bought a ream, which
     contains 500 sheets. We could estimate that a ream of paper is about 2 inches thick and
     weighs about 5 pounds. Scaling these down,
     14

      2 inches  1 ream = 0.004 inches per sheet
        ream 500 pages

      5 pounds  1 ream = 0.01 pounds per sheet, or 0.16 ounces per sheet.
        ream 500 pages

Example 26
     A recipe for zucchini muffins states that it yields 12 muffins, with 250 calories per muffin.
     You instead decide to make mini-muffins, and the recipe yields 20 muffins. If you eat 4,
     how many calories will you consume?

     There are several possible solution pathways to answer this question. We will explore one.

     To answer the question of how many calories 4 mini-muffins will contain, we would want to
     know the number of calories in each mini-muffin. To find the calories in each mini-muffin,
     we could first find the total calories for the entire recipe, then divide it by the number of
     mini-muffins produced. To find the total calories for the recipe, we could multiply the
     calories per standard muffin by the number per muffin. Notice that this produces a multi-step
     solution pathway. It is often easier to solve a problem in small steps, rather than trying to
     find a way to jump directly from the given information to the solution.

     We can now execute our plan:
     12 muffins  250 calories = 3000 calories for the whole recipe

                       muffin
        3000 calories gives 150 calories per mini-muffin
      20 mini - muffins
     4 mini muffins  150 calories totals 600 calories consumed.

Example 27
     You need to replace the boards on your deck. About how much will the materials cost?

     There are two approaches we could take to this problem: 1) estimate the number of boards
     we will need and find the cost per board, or 2) estimate the area of the deck and find the
     approximate cost per square foot for deck boards. We will take the latter approach.

     For this solution pathway, we will be able to answer the question if we know the cost per
     square foot for decking boards and the square footage of the deck. To find the cost per
     square foot for decking boards, we could compute the area of a single board, and divide it
     into the cost for that board. We can compute the square footage of the deck using geometric
     formulas. So first we need information: the dimensions of the deck, and the cost and
     dimensions of a single deck board.

     Suppose that measuring the deck, it is rectangular, measuring 16 ft by 24 ft, for a total area of
     384 ft2.
                                                                                        Problem Solving 15

From a visit to the local home store, you find that an 8 foot by 4 inch cedar deck board costs
about $7.50. The area of this board, doing the necessary conversion from inches to feet, is:
8 feet  4 inches  1 foot = 2.667 ft2. The cost per square foot is then

                    12 inches
  2 $7.50 = $2.8125 per ft2.
2.667 ft

This will allow us to estimate the material cost for the whole 384 ft2 deck
$384 ft2  2 $2.8125 = $1080 total cost.

               ft

Of course, this cost estimate assumes that there is no waste, which is rarely the case. It is
common to add at least 10% to the cost estimate to account for waste.

Example 28
     Is it worth buying a Hyundai Sonata hybrid instead the regular Hyundai Sonata?

To make this decision, we must first decide what our basis for comparison will be. For the
purposes of this example, we'll focus on fuel and purchase costs, but environmental impacts
and maintenance costs are other factors a buyer might consider.

It might be interesting to compare the cost of gas to run both cars for a year. To determine
this, we will need to know the miles per gallon both cars get, as well as the number of miles
we expect to drive in a year. From that information, we can find the number of gallons
required from a year. Using the price of gas per gallon, we can find the running cost.

From Hyundai's website, the 2013 Sonata will get 24 miles per gallon (mpg) in the city, and
35 mpg on the highway. The hybrid will get 35 mpg in the city, and 40 mpg on the highway.

An average driver drives about 12,000 miles a year. Suppose that you expect to drive about
75% of that in the city, so 9,000 city miles a year, and 3,000 highway miles a year.

We can then find the number of gallons each car would require for the year.

Sonata:

9000 city miles  1 gallon + 3000 hightway miles  1 gallon  = 460.7 gallons
         24 city miles  35 highway miles                   = 332.1 gallons

Hybrid:

9000 city miles  1 gallon + 3000 hightway miles  1 gallon
         35 city miles  40 highway miles

If gas in your area averages about $3.50 per gallon, we can use that to find the running cost:

Sonata: 460.7 gallons  $3.50 = $1612.45
                            gallon

Hybrid: 332.1 gallons  $3.50 = $1162.35
                            gallon

The hybrid will save $450.10 a year. The gas costs for the hybrid are about $450.10 =
                                                                                             $1612.45

0.279 = 27.9% lower than the costs for the standard Sonata.

While both the absolute and relative comparisons are useful here, they still make it hard to
answer the original question, since "is it worth it" implies there is some tradeoff for the gas
savings. Indeed, the hybrid Sonata costs about $25,850, compared to the base model for the
regular Sonata, at $20,895.

To better answer the "is it worth it" question, we might explore how long it will take the gas
savings to make up for the additional initial cost. The hybrid costs $4965 more. With gas
savings of $451.10 a year, it will take about 11 years for the gas savings to make up for the
higher initial costs.

We can conclude that if you expect to own the car 11 years, the hybrid is indeed worth it. If
you plan to own the car for less than 11 years, it may still be worth it, since the resale value
of the hybrid may be higher, or for other non-monetary reasons. This is a case where math
can help guide your decision, but it can't make it for you.

6. There is not enough information provided to answer the question, so we will have to make
some assumptions, and look up some values.
Assumptions:
a) We own a car. Suppose it gets 24 miles to the gallon. We will only consider gas cost.
b) We will not need to rent a car in Spokane, but will need to get a taxi from the airport to the

   conference hotel downtown and back.
c) We can get someone to drop us off at the airport, so we don't need to consider airport

   parking.
d) We will not consider whether we will lose money by having to take time off work to drive.

Values looked up (your values may be different)
a) Flight cost: $184
b) Taxi cost: $25 each way (estimate, according to hotel website)
c) Driving distance: 280 miles each way
d) Gas cost: $3.79 a gallon

Cost for flying: $184 flight cost + $50 in taxi fares = $234.
Cost for driving: 560 miles round trip will require 23.3 gallons of gas, costing $88.31.

Based on these assumptions, driving is cheaper. However, our assumption that we only
include gas cost may not be a good one. Tax law allows you deduct $0.55 (in 2012) for each
mile driven, a value that accounts for gas as well as a portion of the car cost, insurance,
maintenance, etc. Based on this number, the cost of driving would be $319.

72. I have an old gas furnace, and am considering replacing it with a new, high efficiency
    model. Is upgrading worth it?

73. Janine is considering buying a water filter and a reusable water bottle rather than buying
    bottled water. Will doing so save her money?

74. Marcus is considering going car-free to save money and be more environmentally
    friendly. Is this financially a good decision?

For the next set of problems, research or make educated estimates for any unknown
quantities needed to answer the question.

75. You want to travel from Tacoma, WA to Chico, CA for a wedding. Compare the costs
    and time involved with driving, flying, and taking a train. Assume that if you fly or take
    the train you'll need to rent a car while you're there. Which option is best?

76. You want to paint the walls of a 6ft by 9ft storage room that has one door and one
    window. You want to put on two coats of paint. How many gallons and/or quarts of
    paint should you buy to paint the room as cheaply as possible?

77. A restaurant in New York tiled their floor with pennies18. Just for the materials, is this
    more expensive than using a more traditional material like ceramic tiles? If each penny
    has to be laid by hand, estimate how long it would take to lay the pennies for a 12ft by
    10ft room. Considering material and labor costs, are pennies a cost-effective replacement
    for ceramic tiles?

78. You are considering taking up part of your back yard and turning it into a vegetable
    garden, to grow broccoli, tomatoes, and zucchini. Will doing so save you money, or cost
    you more than buying vegetables from the store?

79. Barry is trying to decide whether to keep his 1993 Honda Civic with 140,000 miles, or
    trade it in for a used 2008 Honda Civic. Consider gas, maintenance, and insurance costs
    in helping him make a decision.

80. Some people claim it costs more to eat vegetarian, while some claim it costs less.
    Examine your own grocery habits, and compare your current costs to the costs of
    switching your diet (from omnivore to vegetarian or vice versa as appropriate). Which
    diet is more cost effective based on your eating habits?

Extension: Taxes

     Governments collect taxes to pay for the services they provide. In the United States, federal
     income taxes help fund the military, the environmental protection agency, and thousands of
     other programs. Property taxes help fund schools. Gasoline taxes help pay for road
     improvements. While very few people enjoy paying taxes, they are necessary to pay for the
     services we all depend upon.

     Taxes can be computed in a variety of ways, but are typically computed as a percentage of a
     sale, of one's income, or of one's assets.

Example 1
     The sales tax rate in a city is 9.3%. How much sales tax will you pay on a $140 purchase?

     The sales tax will be 9.3% of $140. To compute this, we multiply $140 by the percent
     written as a decimal: $140(0.093) = $13.02.

     When taxes are not given as a fixed percentage rate, sometimes it is necessary to calculate
     the effective rate.

         Effective rate
         The effective tax rate is the equivalent percent rate of the tax paid out of the dollar
         amount the tax is based on.

Example 2
     Joan paid $3,200 in property taxes on her house valued at $215,000 last year. What is the
     effective tax rate?

     We can compute the equivalent percentage: 3200/215000 = 0.01488, or about 1.49%
     effective rate.

     Taxes are often referred to as progressive, regressive, or flat.

         Tax categories
         A flat tax, or proportional tax, charges a constant percentage rate.
         A progressive tax increases the percent rate as the base amount increases.
         A regressive tax decreases the percent rate as the base amount increases.
                                                                                              Problem Solving 31

Example 3
     The United States federal income tax on earned wages is an example of a progressive tax.
     People with a higher wage income pay a higher percent tax on their income.

     For a single person in 2011, adjusted gross income (income after deductions) under $8,500
     was taxed at 10%. Income over $8,500 but under $34,500 was taxed at 15%.

     A person earning $10,000 would pay 10% on the portion of their income under $8,500, and
     15% on the income over $8,500, so they'd pay:

              8500(0.10) = 850 10% of $8500
              1500(0.15) = 225 15% of the remaining $1500 of income
              Total tax: = $1075

     The effective tax rate paid is 1075/10000 = 10.75%

     A person earning $30,000 would also pay 10% on the portion of their income under $8,500,
     and 15% on the income over $8,500, so they'd pay:

                8500(0.10) = 850 10% of $8500
              21500(0.15) = 3225 15% of the remaining $21500 of income
              Total tax: = $4075

     The effective tax rate paid is 4075/30000 = 13.58%.

     Notice that the effective rate has increased with income, showing this is a progressive tax.

Example 4
     A gasoline tax is a flat tax when considered in terms of consumption, a tax of, say, $0.30 per
     gallon is proportional to the amount of gasoline purchased. Someone buying 10 gallons of
     gas at $4 a gallon would pay $3 in tax, which is $3/$40 = 7.5%. Someone buying 30 gallons
     of gas at $4 a gallon would pay $9 in tax, which is $9/$120 = 7.5%, the same effective rate.

     However, in terms of income, a gasoline tax is often considered a regressive tax. It is likely
     that someone earning $30,000 a year and someone earning $60,000 a year will drive about
     the same amount. If both pay $60 in gasoline taxes over a year, the person earning $30,000
     has paid 0.2% of their income, while the person earning $60,000 has paid 0.1% of their
     income in gas taxes.

Income Taxation
   Many people have proposed various revisions to the income tax collection in the United
   States. Some, for example, have claimed that a flat tax would be fairer. Others call for
   revisions to how different types of income are taxed, since currently investment income is
   taxed at a different rate than wage income.

   The following two projects will allow you to explore some of these ideas and draw your own
   conclusions.

   Project 1: Flat tax, Modified Flat Tax, and Progressive Tax.

   Imagine the country is made up of 100 households. The federal government needs to collect
   $800,000 in income taxes to be able to function. The population consists of 6 groups:

   Group A: 20 households that earn $12,000 each
   Group B: 20 households that earn $29,000 each
   Group C: 20 households that earn $50,000 each
   Group D: 20 households that earn $79,000 each
   Group E: 15 households that earn $129,000 each
   Group F: 5 households that earn $295,000 each

   This scenario is roughly proportional to the actual United States population and tax needs.
   We are going to determine new income tax rates.

   The first proposal we'll consider is a flat tax - one where every income group is taxed at the
   same percentage tax rate.

   1) Determine the total income for the population (all 100 people together)

   2) Determine what flat tax rate would be necessary to collect enough money.

   The second proposal we'll consider is a modified flat-tax plan, where everyone only pays
   taxes on any income over $20,000. So, everyone in group A will pay no taxes. Everyone in
   group B will pay taxes only on $9,000.

   3) Determine the total taxable income for the whole population

   4) Determine what flat tax rate would be necessary to collect enough money in this modified
   system
                                                                         Problem Solving 33

5) Complete this table for both the plans

                  Flat Tax Plan                            Modified Flat Tax Plan
                                                      Income tax Income after
Group Income per Income tax Income after              per household taxes

   household per                           taxes

             household

A  $12,000

B  $29,000

C  $50,000

D  $79,000

E  $129,000

F  $295,000

The third proposal we'll consider is a progressive tax, where lower income groups are taxed
at a lower percent rate, and higher income groups are taxed at a higher percent rate. For
simplicity, we're going to assume that a household is taxed at the same rate on all their
income.

6) Set progressive tax rates for each income group to bring in enough money. There is no

one right answer here - just make sure you bring in enough money!

Group Income per Tax rate Income tax Total tax                           Income after

   household (%)                           per        collected for all  taxes per
                                           household  households         household

A  $12,000

B  $29,000

C  $50,000

D  $79,000

E  $129,000

F  $295,000

                                                      This better total
                                                      to $800,000

7) Discretionary income is the income people have left over after paying for necessities like
   rent, food, transportation, etc. The cost of basic expenses does increase with income,
   since housing and car costs are higher, however usually not proportionally. For each
   income group, estimate their essential expenses, and calculate their discretionary income.
   Then compute the effective tax rate for each plan relative to discretionary income rather
   than income.

Project 2: Calculating Taxes.
Visit www.irs.gov, and download the most recent version of forms 1040, and schedules A, B,
C, and D.

Scenario 1: Calculate the taxes for someone who earned $60,000 in standard wage income
    (W-2 income), has no dependents, and takes the standard deduction.

Scenario 2: Calculate the taxes for someone who earned $20,000 in standard wage income,
    $40,000 in qualified dividends, has no dependents, and takes the standard deduction.
    (Qualified dividends are earnings on certain investments such as stocks.)

Scenario 3: Calculate the taxes for someone who earned $60,000 in small business income,
    has no dependents, and takes the standard deduction.

Based on these three scenarios, what are your impressions of how the income tax system
treats these different forms of income (wage, dividends, and business income)?

Scenario 4: To get a more realistic sense for calculating taxes, you'll need to consider
    itemized deductions. Calculate the income taxes for someone with the income and
    expenses listed below.

    Married with 2 children, filing jointly
    Wage income: $50,000 combined
    Paid sales tax in Washington State

                               Voting Theory 35

Voting Theory

     In many decision making situations, it is necessary to gather the group consensus. This
     happens when a group of friends decides which movie to watch, when a company decides
     which product design to manufacture, and when a democratic country elects its leaders.

     While the basic idea of voting is fairly universal, the method by which those votes are used to
     determine a winner can vary. Amongst a group of friends, you may decide upon a movie by
     voting for all the movies you're willing to watch, with the winner being the one with the
     greatest approval. A company might eliminate unpopular designs then revote on the
     remaining. A country might look for the candidate with the most votes.

     In deciding upon a winner, there is always one main goal: to reflect the preferences of the
     people in the most fair way possible.

 Preference Schedules
     To begin, we're going to want more information than a traditional ballot normally provides.
     A traditional ballot usually asks you to pick your favorite from a list of choices. This ballot
     fails to provide any information on how a voter would rank the alternatives if their first
     choice was unsuccessful.

Preference ballot
A preference ballot is a ballot in which the voter ranks the choices in order of
preference.

Example 1
      A vacation club is trying to decide which destination to visit this year: Hawaii (H), Orlando
     (O), or Anaheim (A). Their votes are shown below:

Bob Ann Marv Alice Eve Omar Lupe Dave Tish Jim

1st choice A A O H A O    H O  H A

2nd choice O H H A H H    A H  A H

3rd choice H O A O O A    O A  O O

These individual ballots are typically combined into one preference schedule, which shows
the number of voters in the top row that voted for each option:

1                3  3  3

1st choice A     A  O  H

2nd choice O     H  H  A

3rd choice H     O  A  O

Notice that by totaling the vote counts across the top of the preference schedule we can
recover the total number of votes cast: 1+3+3+3 = 10 total votes.

Plurality
   The voting method we're most familiar with in the United States is the plurality method.

       Plurality Method
       In this method, the choice with the most first-preference votes is declared the winner.
       Ties are possible, and would have to be settled through some sort of run-off vote.

   This method is sometimes mistakenly called the majority method, or "majority rules", but it
   is not necessary for a choice to have gained a majority of votes to win. A majority is over
   50%; it is possible for a winner to have a plurality without having a majority.

Example 2
     In our election from above, we had the preference table:

1             3  3  3

1st choice A  A  O  H

2nd choice O  H  H  A

3rd choice H  O  A  O

For the plurality method, we only care about the first choice options. Totaling them up:
Anaheim: 1+3 = 4 first-choice votes
Orlando: 3 first-choice votes
Hawaii: 3 first-choice votes

Anaheim is the winner using the plurality voting method.

Notice that Anaheim won with 4 out of 10 votes, 40% of the votes, which is a plurality of the
votes, but not a majority.

Note: In the third column and last column, those voters only recorded a first-place vote, so
we don't know who their second and third choices would have been.

                                                                           Voting Theory 37

What's Wrong with Plurality?

The election from Example 2 may seem totally clean, but there is a problem lurking that
arises whenever there are three or more choices. Looking back at our preference table, how
would our members vote if they only had two choices?

Anaheim vs Orlando: 7 out of the 10 would prefer Anaheim over Orlando

1             3  3  3

1st choice A  A  O  H

2nd choice O  H  H  A

3rd choice H  O  A  O

Anaheim vs Hawaii: 6 out of 10 would prefer Hawaii over Anaheim

1             3  3  3

1st choice A  A  O  H

2nd choice O  H  H  A

3rd choice H  O  A  O

This doesn't seem right, does it? Anaheim just won the election, yet 6 out of 10 voters, 60%
of them, would have preferred Hawaii! That hardly seems fair. Marquis de Condorcet, a
French philosopher, mathematician, and political scientist wrote about how this could happen
in 1785, and for him we name our first fairness criterion.

Fairness Criteria
The fairness criteria are statements that seem like they should be true in a fair election.

Condorcet Criterion
If there is a choice that is preferred in every one-to-one comparison with the other
choices, that choice should be the winner. We call this winner the Condorcet Winner,
or Condorcet Candidate.

Example 3
     In the election from Example 2, what choice is the Condorcet Winner?

We see above that Hawaii is preferred over Anaheim. Comparing Hawaii to Orlando, we can
see 6 out of 10 would prefer Hawaii to Orlando.

1             3  3  3

1st choice A  A  O  H

2nd choice O  H  H  A

3rd choice H  O  A  O

Since Hawaii is preferred in a one-to-one comparison to both other choices, Hawaii is the
Condorcet Winner.

Example 4

     Consider a city council election in a district that is historically 60% Democratic voters and
     40% Republican voters. Even though city council is technically a nonpartisan office, people
     generally know the affiliations of the candidates. In this election there are three candidates:
     Don and Key, both Democrats, and Elle, a Republican. A preference schedule for the votes
     looks as follows:

                    342 214 298
    1st choice Elle Don Key
    2nd choice Don Key Don
    3rd choice Key Elle Elle

We can see a total of 342 + 214 + 298 = 854 voters participated in this election. Computing
percentage of first place votes:
Don: 214/854 = 25.1%
Key: 298/854 = 34.9%
Elle: 342/854 = 40.0%

So in this election, the Democratic voters split their vote over the two Democratic candidates,
allowing the Republican candidate Elle to win under the plurality method with 40% of the
vote.

Analyzing this election closer, we see that it violates the Condorcet Criterion.  Analyzing the
one-to-one comparisons:
Elle vs Don: 342 prefer Elle; 512 prefer Don: Don is preferred
Elle vs Key: 342 prefer Elle; 512 prefer Key: Key is preferred
Don vs Key: 556 prefer Don; 298 prefer Key: Don is preferred

So even though Don had the smallest number of first-place votes in the election, he is the
Condorcet winner, being preferred in every one-to-one comparison with the other candidates.

Try it Now 2
Consider the election from Try it Now 1. Is there a Condorcet winner in this election?

                                                                                         Voting Theory 39

   Insincere Voting
   Situations like the one in Example 4 above, when there are more than one candidate that
   share somewhat similar points of view, can lead to insincere voting. Insincere voting is
   when a person casts a ballot counter to their actual preference for strategic purposes. In the
   case above, the democratic leadership might realize that Don and Key will split the vote, and
   encourage voters to vote for Key by officially endorsing him. Not wanting to see their party
   lose the election, as happened in the scenario above, Don's supporters might insincerely vote
   for Key, effectively voting against Elle.

Instant Runoff Voting
   Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), also called Plurality with Elimination, is a modification of the
   plurality method that attempts to address the issue of insincere voting.

       Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)
       In IRV, voting is done with preference ballots, and a preference schedule is generated.
       The choice with the least first-place votes is then eliminated from the election, and any
       votes for that candidate are redistributed to the voters' next choice. This continues
       until a choice has a majority (over 50%).

   This is similar to the idea of holding runoff elections, but since every voter's order of
   preference is recorded on the ballot, the runoff can be computed without requiring a second
   costly election.

   This voting method is used in several political elections around the world, including election
   of members of the Australian House of Representatives, and was used for county positions in
   Pierce County, Washington until it was eliminated by voters in 2009. A version of IRV is
   used by the International Olympic Committee to select host nations.

Example 5
     Consider the preference schedule below, in which a company's advertising team is voting on
     five different advertising slogans, called A, B, C, D, and E here for simplicity.

Initial votes

               3  4  4  6  2  1

1st choice B      C  B  D  B  E

2nd choice C      A  D  C  E  A

3rd choice A      D  C  A  A  D

4th choice D      B  A  E  C  B

5th choice E      E  E  B  D  C

If this was a plurality election, note that B would be the winner with 9 first-choice votes,
compared to 6 for D, 4 for C, and 1 for E.

There are total of 3+4+4+6+2+1 = 20 votes. A majority would be 11 votes. No one yet has a
majority, so we proceed to elimination rounds.
40

Round 1: We make our first elimination. Choice A has the fewest first-place votes, so we

remove that choice

                3       4   4  6  2  1

    1st choice B        C   B  D  B  E

    2nd choice C            D  C  E

    3rd choice          D   C        D

    4th choice D        B      E  C  B

    5th choice E        E   E  B  D  C

We then shift everyone's choices up to fill the gaps. There is still no choice with a majority,

so we eliminate again.

                3       4   4  6  2  1

    1st choice B        C   B  D  B  E

    2nd choice C        D   D  C  E  D

    3rd choice D        B   C  E  C  B

    4th choice E        E   E  B  D  C

Round 2: We make our second elimination. Choice E has the fewest first-place votes, so we

remove that choice, shifting everyone's options to fill the gaps.

                3       4   4  6  2  1

    1st choice B        C   B  D  B  D

    2nd choice C        D   D  C  C  B

    3rd choice D        B   C  B  D  C

Notice that the first and fifth columns have the same preferences now, we can condense those

down to one column.

                5       4   4  6  1

    1st choice B        C   B  D  D

    2nd choice C        D   D  C  B

    3rd choice D        B   C  B  C

Now B has 9 first-choice votes, C has 4 votes, and D has 7 votes. Still no majority, so we
eliminate again.

Round 3: We make our third elimination. C has the fewest votes.

                5       4   4  6  1

    1st choice B        D   B  D  D

    2nd choice D        B   D  B  B

Condensing this down:

                9       11

    1st choice B        D

    2nd choice D        B

D has now gained a majority, and is declared the winner under IRV.

Try it Now 3
Consider again the election from Try it Now 1. Find the winner using IRV.

            44 14 20 70 22 80 39

1st choice G        G  G           M M B              B

2nd choice M        B              G       B       M

3rd choice B        M              B       G       G

     What's Wrong with IRV?
Example 6

     Let's return to our City Council Election
                         342 214 298

         1st choice Elle Don Key
         2nd choice Don Key Don
         3rd choice Key Elle Elle

     In this election, Don has the smallest number of first place votes, so Don is eliminated in the
     first round. The 214 people who voted for Don have their votes transferred to their second
     choice, Key.

                         342 512
         1st choice Elle Key
         2nd choice Key Elle

So Key is the winner under the IRV method.

We can immediately notice that in this election, IRV violates the Condorcet Criterion, since
we determined earlier that Don was the Condorcet winner. On the other hand, the temptation
has been removed for Don's supporters to vote for Key; they now know their vote will be
transferred to Key, not simply discarded.

Example 7

Consider the voting system below.

1st choice  37         22          12      29
2nd choice  Adams      Brown       Brown   Carter
3rd choice  Brown      Carter      Adams   Adams
            Carter     Adams       Carter  Brown

In this election, Carter would be eliminated in the first round, and Adams would be the
winner with 66 votes to 34 for Brown.
42

Now suppose that the results were announced, but election officials accidentally destroyed
the ballots before they could be certified, and the votes had to be recast. Wanting to "jump
on the bandwagon", 10 of the voters who had originally voted in the order Brown, Adams,
Carter change their vote to favor the presumed winner, changing those votes to Adams,
Brown, Carter.

    1st choice  47      22      2       29
    2nd choice  Adams   Brown   Brown   Carter
    3rd choice  Brown   Carter  Adams   Adams
                Carter  Adams   Carter  Brown

In this re-vote, Brown will be eliminated in the first round, having the fewest first-place
votes. After transferring votes, we find that Carter will win this election with 51 votes to
Adams' 49 votes! Even though the only vote changes made favored Adams, the change
ended up costing Adams the election. This doesn't seem right, and introduces our second
fairness criterion:

       Monotonicity Criterion
       If voters change their votes to increase the preference for a candidate, it should not
       harm that candidate's chances of winning.

   This criterion is violated by this election. Note that even though the criterion is violated in
   this particular election, it does not mean that IRV always violates the criterion; just that IRV
   has the potential to violate the criterion in certain elections.

Borda Count
   Borda Count is another voting method, named for Jean-Charles de Borda, who developed the
   system in 1770.

       Borda Count
       In this method, points are assigned to candidates based on their ranking; 1 point for last
       choice, 2 points for second-to-last choice, and so on. The point values for all ballots
       are totaled, and the candidate with the largest point total is the winner.

Example 8                                                                       Seattle
     A group of mathematicians are getting together for a
     conference. The members are coming from four cities:                Tacoma
     Seattle, Tacoma, Puyallup, and Olympia. Their                          Puyallup
     approximate locations on a map are shown to the right.
                                                             Olympia
     The votes for where to hold the conference were:
                                                                  Voting Theory 43

1st choice  51          25        10        14
2nd choice  Seattle     Tacoma    Puyallup  Olympia
3rd choice  Tacoma      Puyallup  Tacoma    Tacoma
4th choice  Olympia     Olympia   Olympia   Puyallup
            Puyallup    Seattle   Seattle   Seattle

In each of the 51 ballots ranking Seattle first, Puyallup will be given 1 point, Olympia 2
points, Tacoma 3 points, and Seattle 4 points. Multiplying the points per vote times the
number of votes allows us to calculate points awarded:

1st choice  51          25            10         14
4 points    Seattle     Tacoma        Puyallup   Olympia
            4·51 = 204  4·25 =        4·10 = 40  4·14 = 56
2nd choice              100
3 points    Tacoma      Puyallup      Tacoma     Tacoma
            3·51 = 153  3·25 = 75     3·10 = 30  3·14 = 42
3rd choice
2 points    Olympia     Olympia       Olympia    Puyallup
            2·51 = 102  2·25 = 50     2·10 = 20  2·14 = 28
4th choice
1 point     Puyallup    Seattle       Seattle    Seattle
            1·51 = 51   1·25 = 25     1·10 = 10  1·14 = 14

Adding up the points:
Seattle: 204 + 25 + 10 + 14 = 253 points
Tacoma: 153 + 100 + 30 + 42 = 325 points
Puyallup: 51 + 75 + 40 + 28 = 194 points
Olympia: 102 + 50 + 20 + 56 = 228 points

Under the Borda Count method, Tacoma is the winner of this vote.

Try it Now 4
Consider again the election from Try it Now 1. Find the winner using Borda Count. Since
we have some incomplete preference ballots, for simplicity, give every unranked candidate 1
point, the points they would normally get for last place.

3rd choice B  M                    B        G    G

   What's Wrong with Borda Count?
   You might have already noticed one potential flaw of the Borda Count from the previous
   example. In that example, Seattle had a majority of first-choice votes, yet lost the election!
   This seems odd, and prompts our next fairness criterion:

       Majority Criterion
       If a choice has a majority of first-place votes, that choice should be the winner.

   The election from Example 8 using the Borda Count violates the Majority Criterion. Notice
   also that this automatically means that the Condorcet Criterion will also be violated, as
   Seattle would have been preferred by 51% of voters in any head-to-head comparison.

   Borda count is sometimes described as a consensus-based voting system, since it can
   sometimes choose a more broadly acceptable option over the one with majority support. In
   the example above, Tacoma is probably the best compromise location. This is a different
   approach than plurality and instant runoff voting that focus on first-choice votes; Borda
   Count considers every voter's entire ranking to determine the outcome.

   Because of this consensus behavior, Borda Count, or some variation of it, is commonly used
   in awarding sports awards. Variations are used to determine the Most Valuable Player in
   baseball, to rank teams in NCAA sports, and to award the Heisman trophy.

Copeland's Method (Pairwise Comparisons)
   So far none of our voting methods have satisfied the Condorcet Criterion. The Copeland
   Method specifically attempts to satisfy the Condorcet Criterion by looking at pairwise (one-
   to-one) comparisons.

       Copeland's Method
       In this method, each pair of candidates is compared, using all preferences to determine
       which of the two is more preferred. The more preferred candidate is awarded 1 point.
       If there is a tie, each candidate is awarded ½ point. After all pairwise comparisons are
       made, the candidate with the most points, and hence the most pairwise wins, is
       declared the winner.

   Variations of Copeland's Method are used in many professional organizations, including
   election of the Board of Trustees for the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia.
                                              Voting Theory 45

Example 9
     Consider our vacation group example from the beginning of the chapter. Determine the
     winner using Copeland's Method.

1                    3  3  3

1st choice A         A  O  H

2nd choice O         H  H  A

3rd choice H         O  A  O

We need to look at each pair of choices, and see which choice would win in a one-to-one
comparison. You may recall we did this earlier when determining the Condorcet Winner.
For example, comparing Hawaii vs Orlando, we see that 6 voters, those shaded below in the
first table below, would prefer Hawaii to Orlando. Note that Hawaii doesn't have to be the
voter's first choice - we're imagining that Anaheim wasn't an option. If it helps, you can
imagine removing Anaheim, as in the second table below.

                133 3                     133 3
1st choice A A O H
2nd choice O H H A            1st choice                          O H
3rd choice H O A O
                              2nd choice O H H

                              3rd choice H O                      O

Based on this, in the comparison of Hawaii vs Orlando, Hawaii wins, and receives 1 point.

Comparing Anaheim to Orlando, the 1 voter in the first column clearly prefers Anaheim, as
do the 3 voters in the second column. The 3 voters in the third column clearly prefer
Orlando. The 3 voters in the last column prefer Hawaii as their first choice, but if they had to
choose between Anaheim and Orlando, they'd choose Anaheim, their second choice overall.
So, altogether 1+3+3=7 voters prefer Anaheim over Orlando, and 3 prefer Orlando over
Anaheim. So, comparing Anaheim vs Orlando: 7 votes to 3 votes: Anaheim gets 1 point.

All together,           6 votes to 4 votes: Hawaii gets 1 point
Hawaii vs Orlando:      7 votes to 3 votes: Anaheim gets 1 point
Anaheim vs Orlando:     6 votes to 4 votes: Hawaii gets 1 point
Hawaii vs Anaheim:

Hawaii is the winner under Copeland's Method, having earned the most points.

Notice this process is consistent with our determination of a Condorcet Winner.

Example 10

Consider the advertising group's vote we explored earlier. Determine the winner using

Copeland's method.

            3       4         4  6  2                 1

    1st choice B    C         B  D  B                 E

    2nd choice C    A         D  C  E                 A

    3rd choice A    D         C  A  A                 D

    4th choice D    B         A  E  C                 B

    5th choice E    E         E  B  D                 C

With 5 candidates, there are 10 comparisons to make:

A vs B: 11 votes to 9 votes      A gets 1 point

A vs C: 3 votes to 17 votes      C gets 1 point

A vs D: 10 votes to 10 votes     A gets ½ point, D gets ½ point

A vs E: 17 votes to 3 votes      A gets 1 point

B vs C: 10 votes to 10 votes     B gets ½ point, C gets ½ point

B vs D: 9 votes to 11 votes      D gets 1 point

B vs E: 13 votes to 7 votes      B gets 1 point

C vs D: 9 votes to 11 votes      D gets 1 point

C vs E: 17 votes to 3 votes      C gets 1 point

D vs E: 17 votes to 3 votes      D gets 1 point

Totaling these up:
A gets 2½ points
B gets 1½ points
C gets 2½ points
D gets 3½ points
E gets 0 points

Using Copeland's Method, we declare D as the winner.

Notice that in this case, D is not a Condorcet Winner. While Copeland's method will also
select a Condorcet Candidate as the winner, the method still works in cases where there is no
Condorcet Winner.

Try it Now 5
Consider again the election from Try it Now 1. Find the winner using Copeland's method.
Since we have some incomplete preference ballots, we'll have to adjust. For example, when
comparing M to B, we'll ignore the 20 votes in the third column which do not rank either
candidate.

What's Wrong with Copeland's Method?
As already noted, Copeland's Method does satisfy the Condorcet Criterion. It also satisfies
the Majority Criterion and the Monotonicity Criterion. So is this the perfect method? Well,
in a word, no.

Example 11
     A committee is trying to award a scholarship to one of four students, Anna (A), Brian (B),
     Carlos (C), and Dimitry (D). The votes are shown below:

5                 5           6  4

1st choice D      A           C  B

2nd choice A      C           B  D

3rd choice C      B           D  A

4th choice B      D           A  C

Making the comparisons:       A gets ½ point, B gets ½ point
A vs B: 10 votes to 10 votes  A gets 1 point
A vs C: 14 votes to 6 votes:  D gets 1 point
A vs D: 5 votes to 15 votes:  C gets 1 point
B vs C: 4 votes to 16 votes:  B gets 1 point
B vs D: 15 votes to 5 votes:  C gets 1 point
C vs D: 11 votes to 9 votes:

Totaling:                  B has 1 ½ points
A has 1 ½ points  D has 1 point
C has 2 points

So Carlos is awarded the scholarship. However, the committee then discovers that Dimitry
was not eligible for the scholarship (he failed his last math class). Even though this seems
like it shouldn't affect the outcome, the committee decides to recount the vote, removing
Dimitry from consideration. This reduces the preference schedule to:

5                 5           6  4

1st choice A      A           C  B

2nd choice C      C           B  A

3rd choice B      B           A  C

A vs B: 10 votes to 10 votes A gets ½ point, B gets ½ point
A vs C: 14 votes to 6 votes A gets 1 point
B vs C: 4 votes to 16 votes C gets 1 point

Totaling:                     B has ½ point
A has 1 ½ points
C has 1 point

Suddenly Anna is the winner! This leads us to another fairness criterion.
48

   The Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) Criterion
   If a non-winning choice is removed from the ballot, it should not change the winner of
   the election.

   Equivalently, if choice A is preferred over choice B, introducing or removing a choice
   C should not cause B to be preferred over A.

   In the election from Example 11, the IIA Criterion was violated.

   This anecdote illustrating the IIA issue is attributed to Sidney Morgenbesser:

            After finishing dinner, Sidney Morgenbesser decides to order dessert. The waitress
            tells him he has two choices: apple pie and blueberry pie. Sidney orders the apple pie.
            After a few minutes the waitress returns and says that they also have cherry pie at
            which point Morgenbesser says "In that case I'll have the blueberry pie."

   Another disadvantage of Copeland's Method is that it is fairly easy for the election to end in
   a tie. For this reason, Copeland's method is usually the first part of a more advanced method
   that uses more sophisticated methods for breaking ties and determining the winner when
   there is not a Condorcet Candidate.

So Where's the Fair Method?
   At this point, you're probably asking why we keep looking at method after method just to
   point out that they are not fully fair. We must be holding out on the perfect method, right?

   Unfortunately, no. A mathematical economist, Kenneth Arrow, was able to prove in 1949
   that there is no voting method that will satisfy all the fairness criteria we have discussed.

       Arrow's Impossibility Theorem
       Arrow's Impossibility Theorem states, roughly, that it is not possible for a voting
       method to satisfy every fairness criteria that we've discussed.

To see a very simple example of how difficult voting can be, consider the election below:

5             5                5

1st choice A  C                B

2nd choice B  A                C

3rd choice C  B                A

Notice that in this election:
10 people prefer A to B
10 people prefer B to C
10 people prefer C to A
                                                                                     Voting Theory 49

No matter whom we choose as the winner, 2/3 of voters would prefer someone else! This
scenario is dubbed Condorcet's Voting Paradox, and demonstrates how voting preferences
are not transitive (just because A is preferred over B, and B over C, does not mean A is
preferred over C). In this election, there is no fair resolution.

It is because of this impossibility of a totally fair method that Plurality, IRV, Borda Count,
Copeland's Method, and dozens of variants are all still used. Usually the decision of which
method to use is based on what seems most fair for the situation in which it is being applied.

Approval Voting
   Up until now, we've been considering voting methods that require ranking of candidates on a
   preference ballot. There is another method of voting that can be more appropriate in some
   decision making scenarios. With Approval Voting, the ballot asks you to mark all choices
   that you find acceptable. The results are tallied, and the option with the most approval is the
   winner.

Example 12

     A group of friends is trying to decide upon a movie to watch. Three choices are provided,
     and each person is asked to mark with an "X" which movies they are willing to watch. The
     results are:

          Bob Ann Marv Alice Eve Omar Lupe Dave Tish Jim

Titanic      X X                                  X        X     X

Scream    X     X X                               X     X     X

The Matrix X X X X X                                    X        X

Totaling the results, we find
Titanic received 5 approvals
Scream received 6 approvals
The Matrix received 7 approvals.

In this vote, The Matrix would be the winner.

     What's Wrong with Approval Voting?
     Approval voting can very easily violate the Majority Criterion.

Example 13
     Consider the voting schedule:

                80 15 5

    1st choice A   B    C

    2nd choice B   C    B

    3rd choice C   A    A

Clearly A is the majority winner. Now suppose that this election was held using Approval
Voting, and every voter marked approval of their top two candidates.

A would receive approval from 80 voters
B would receive approval from 100 voters
C would receive approval from 20 voters

B would be the winner. Some argue that Approval Voting tends to vote the least disliked
choice, rather than the most liked candidate.

Additionally, Approval Voting is susceptible to strategic insincere voting, in which a voter
does not vote their true preference to try to increase the chances of their choice winning. For
example, in the movie example above, suppose Bob and Alice would much rather watch
Scream. They remove The Matrix from their approval list, resulting in a different result.

                Bob Ann Marv Alice Eve Omar Lupe Dave Tish Jim

    Titanic        X X        X                                       X     X

    Scream      X     X X     X  X                                       X

    The Matrix     X X     X     X                                          X

Totaling the results, we find Titanic received 5 approvals, Scream received 6 approvals, and
The Matrix received 5 approvals. By voting insincerely, Bob and Alice were able to sway
the result in favor of their preference.

Voting in America
   In American politics, there is a lot more to selecting our representatives than simply casting
   and counting ballots. The process of selecting the president is even more complicated, so
   we'll save that for the next chapter. Instead, let's look at the process by which state
   congressional representatives and local politicians get elected.

   For most offices, a sequence of two public votes is held: a primary election and the general
   election. For non-partisan offices like sheriff and judge, in which political party affiliation is
   not declared, the primary election is usually used to narrow the field of candidates.
                                                                                     Voting Theory 51

Typically, the two candidates receiving the most votes in the primary will then move forward
to the general election. While somewhat similar to instant runoff voting, this is actually an
example of sequential voting - a process in which voters cast totally new ballots after each
round of eliminations. Sequential voting has become quite common in television, where it is
used in reality competition shows like American Idol.

Congressional, county, and city representatives are partisan offices, in which candidates
usually declare themselves a member of a political party, like the Democrats, Republicans,
the Green Party, or one of the many other smaller parties. As with non-partisan offices, a
primary election is usually held to narrow down the field prior to the general election. Prior
to the primary election, the candidate would have met with the political party leaders and
gotten their approval to run under that party's affiliation.

In some states a closed primary is used, in which only voters who are members of the
Democrat party can vote on the Democratic candidates, and similar for Republican voters. In
other states, an open primary is used, in which any voter can pick the party whose primary
they want to vote in. In other states, caucuses are used, which are basically meetings of the
political parties, only open to party members. Closed primaries are often disliked by
independent voters, who like the flexibility to change which party they are voting in. Open
primaries do have the disadvantage that they allow raiding, in which a voter will vote in their
non-preferred party's primary with the intent of selecting a weaker opponent for their
preferred party's candidate.

Washington State currently uses a different method, called a top 2 primary, in which voters
select from the candidates from all political parties on the primary, and the top two
candidates, regardless of party affiliation, move on to the general election. While this
method is liked by independent voters, it gives the political parties incentive to select a top
candidate internally before the primary, so that two candidates will not split the party's vote.

Regardless of the primary type, the general election is the main election, open to all voters.
Except in the case of the top 2 primary, the top candidate from each major political party
would be included in the general election. While rules vary state-to-state, for an
independent or minor party candidate to get listed on the ballot, they typically have to gather
a certain number of signatures to petition for inclusion.

2. Determining the Condorcet Winner:
G vs M: 44+14+20 = 78 prefer G, 70+22+80=172 prefer M: M preferred
G vs B: 44+14+20+70=148 prefer G, 22+80+39 = 141 prefer B: G preferred
M vs B: 44+70+22=136 prefer M, 14+80+39=133 prefer B: M preferred
M is the Condorcet winner, based on the information we have.

3. Using IRV:

G: 132+42+60+140+22+80+39 = 515 pts
M: 88+14+20+210+66+160+39 = 597 pts
B: 44+28+20+70+44+240+117 = 563 pts

McCarthy (M) would be the winner using Borda Count.

5. Using Copeland's Method:
Looking back at our work from Try it Now #2, we see
G vs M: 44+14+20 = 78 prefer G, 70+22+80=172 prefer M: M preferred - 1 point
G vs B: 44+14+20+70=148 prefer G, 22+80+39 = 141 prefer B: G preferred - 1 point
M vs B: 44+70+22=136 prefer M, 14+80+39=133 prefer B: M preferred - 1 point

M earns 2 points; G earns 1 point. M wins under Copeland's method.

6. Using Approval voting:
Seattle has 30+10+15+5 = 60 approval votes
Tacoma has 30+15+20+15+5 = 85 approval votes
Puyallup has 10+20+25+5 = 50 approval votes
Olympia has 15+15+5 = 35 approval votes

Tacoma wins under this approval voting

    assigned an order of comparison, called an agenda. The first two choices are
    compared. The winner is then compared to the next choice on the agenda, and this
    continues until all choices have been compared against the winner of the previous
    comparison.
         a. Using the preference schedule below, apply Sequential Pairwise voting to
             determine the winner, using the agenda: A, B, C, D.
              Number of voters 10 15 12
                   1st choice C A B
                  2nd choice A B D
                  3rd choice B D C
                   4th choice D C A
         b. Show that Sequential Pairwise voting can violate the Pareto criterion.
         c. Show that Sequential Pairwise voting can violate the Majority criterion.

25. The Coombs method is a variation of instant runoff voting. In Coombs method, the
    choice with the most last place votes is eliminated. Apply Coombs method to the
    preference schedules from questions 5 and 6.

26. Copeland's Method is designed to identify a Condorcet Candidate if there is one, and
    is considered a Condorcet Method. There are many Condorcet Methods, which vary
    primarily in how they deal with ties, which are very common when a Condorcet
    winner does not exist. Copeland's method does not have a tie-breaking procedure
    built-in. Research the Schulze method, another Condorcet method that is used by the
    Wikimedia foundation that runs Wikipedia, and give some examples of how it works.

27. The plurality method is used in most U.S. elections. Some people feel that Ross Perot
    in 1992 and Ralph Nader in 2000 changed what the outcome of the election would
    have been if they had not run. Research the outcomes of these elections and explain
    how each candidate could have affected the outcome of the elections (for the 2000
    election, you may wish to focus on the count in Florida). Describe how an alternative
    voting method could have avoided this issue.

28. Instant Runoff Voting and Approval voting have supporters advocating that they be
    adopted in the United States and elsewhere to decide elections. Research
    comparisons between the two methods describing the advantages and disadvantages
    of each in practice. Summarize the comparisons, and form your own opinion about
    whether either method should be adopted.

    29. In a primary system, a first vote is held with multiple candidates. In some states, each
         political party has its own primary. In Washington State, there is a "top two"
         primary, where all candidates are on the ballot and the top two candidates advance to
         the general election, regardless of party. Compare and contrast the top two primary
         with general election system to instant runoff voting, considering both differences in
         the methods, and practical differences like cost, campaigning, fairness, etc.

    30. In a primary system, a first vote is held with multiple candidates. In some many
         states, where voters must declare a party to vote in the primary election, and they are
         only able to choose between candidates for their declared party. The top candidate
         from each party then advances to the general election. Compare and contrast this
         primary with general election system to instant runoff voting, considering both
         differences in the methods, and practical differences like cost, campaigning, fairness,
         etc.

    31. Sometimes in a voting scenario it is desirable to rank the candidates, either to
         establish preference order between a set of choices, or because the election requires
         multiple winners. For example, a hiring committee may have 30 candidates apply,
         and need to select 6 to interview, so the voting by the committee would need to
         produce the top 6 candidates. Describe how Plurality, Instant Runoff Voting, Borda
         Count, and Copeland's Method could be extended to produce a ranked list of
         candidates.

Weighted Voting

     In a corporate shareholders meeting, each shareholders' vote counts proportional to the
     amount of shares they own. An individual with one share gets the equivalent of one vote,
     while someone with 100 shares gets the equivalent of 100 votes. This is called weighted
     voting, where each vote has some weight attached to it. Weighted voting is sometimes used
     to vote on candidates, but more commonly to decide "yes" or "no" on a proposal, sometimes
     called a motion. Weighted voting is applicable in corporate settings, as well as decision
     making in parliamentary governments and voting in the United Nations Security Council.

     In weighted voting, we are most often interested in the power each voter has in influencing
     the outcome.

 Beginnings
     We'll begin with some basic vocabulary for weighted voting systems.

         Vocabulary for Weighted Voting
         Each individual or entity casting a vote is called a player in the election. They're often
         notated as P1, P2, P3 , ... ,PN, where N is the total number of voters.

         Each player is given a weight, which usually represents how many votes they get.

         The quota is the minimum weight needed for the votes or weight needed for the
         proposal to be approved.

         A weighted voting system will often be represented in a shorthand form:

              [q: w1, w2, w3, ... , wn]

         In this form, q is the quota, w1 is the weight for player 1, and so on.

Example 1
     In a small company, there are 4 shareholders. Mr. Smith has a 30% ownership stake in the
     company, Mr. Garcia has a 25% stake, Mrs. Hughes has a 25% stake, and Mrs. Lee has a
     20% stake. They are trying to decide whether to open a new location. The company by-
     laws state that more than 50% of the ownership has to approve any decision like this. This
     could be represented by the weighted voting system:
            [51: 30, 25, 25, 20]

     Here we have treated the percentage ownership as votes, so Mr. Smith gets the equivalent of
     30 votes, having a 30% ownership stake. Since more than 50% is required to approve the
     decision, the quota is 51, the smallest whole number over 50.

   In order to have a meaningful weighted voting system, it is necessary to put some limits on
   the quota.

       Limits on the Quota
       The quota must be more than ½ the total number of votes.
       The quota can't be larger than the total number of votes.

   Why? Consider the voting system [q: 3, 2, 1]

   Here there are 6 total votes. If the quota was set at only 3, then player 1 could vote yes,
   players 2 and 3 could vote no, and both would reach quota, which doesn't lead to a decision
   being made. In order for only one decision to reach quota at a time, the quota must be at
   least half the total number of votes. If the quota was set to 7, then no group of voters could
   ever reach quota, and no decision can be made, so it doesn't make sense for the quota to be
   larger than the total number of voters.

   Try it Now 1
   In a committee there are four representatives from the management and three representatives
   from the workers' union. For a proposal to pass, four of the members must support it,
   including at least one member of the union. Find a voting system that can represent this
   situation.

A Look at Power
   Consider the voting system [10: 11, 3, 2]. Notice that in this system, player 1 can reach
   quota without the support of any other player. When this happens, we say that player 1 is a
   dictator.

       Dictator
       A player will be a dictator if their weight is equal to or greater than the quota. The
       dictator can also block any proposal from passing; the other players cannot reach quota
       without the dictator.

   In the voting system [8: 6, 3, 2], no player is a dictator. However, in this system, the quota
   can only be reached if player 1 is in support of the proposal; player 2 and 3 cannot reach
   quota without player 1's support. In this case, player 1 is said to have veto power. Notice
   that player 1 is not a dictator, since player 1 would still need player 2 or 3's support to reach
   quota.

       Veto Power
       A player has veto power if their support is necessary for the quota to be reached. It is
       possible for more than one player to have veto power, or for no player to have veto
       power.
                                                                                        Weighted Voting 61

     With the system [10: 7, 6, 2], player 3 is said to be a dummy, meaning they have no
     influence in the outcome. The only way the quota can be met is with the support of both
     players 1 and 2 (both of which would have veto power here); the vote of player 3 cannot
     affect the outcome.

         Dummy
         A player is a dummy if their vote is never essential for a group to reach quota.

Example 2
     In the voting system [16: 7, 6, 3, 3, 2], are any players dictators? Do any have veto power?
     Are any dummies?

     No player can reach quota alone, so there are no dictators.

     Without player 1, the rest of the players' weights add to 14, which doesn't reach quota, so
     player 1 has veto power. Likewise, without player 2, the rest of the players' weights add to
     15, which doesn't reach quota, so player 2 also has veto power.

     Since player 1 and 2 can reach quota with either player 3 or player 4's support, neither player
     3 or player 4 have veto power. However they cannot reach quota with player 5's support
     alone, so player 5 has no influence on the outcome and is a dummy.

     Try it Now 2
     In the voting system [q: 10, 5, 3], which players are dictators, have veto power, and are
     dummies if the quota is 10? 12? 16?

     To better define power, we need to introduce the idea of a coalition. A coalition is a group
     of players voting the same way. In the example above, {P1, P2, P4} would represent the
     coalition of players 1, 2 and 4. This coalition has a combined weight of 7+6+3 = 16, which
     meets quota, so this would be a winning coalition.

     A player is said to be critical in a coalition if them leaving the coalition would change it
     from a winning coalition to a losing coalition. In the coalition {P1, P2, P4}, every player is
     critical. In the coalition {P3, P4, P5}, no player is critical, since it wasn't a winning coalition
     to begin with. In the coalition {P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}, only players 1 and 2 are critical; any other
     player could leave the coalition and it would still meet quota.

         Coalitions and Critical Players
         A coalition is any group of players voting the same way.

         A coalition is a winning coalition if the coalition has enough weight to meet quota.

         A player is critical in a coalition if them leaving the coalition would change it from a
         winning coalition to a losing coalition.
     62

Example 3
     In the Scottish Parliament in 2009 there were 5 political parties: 47 representatives for the
     Scottish National Party, 46 for the Labour Party, 17 for the Conservative Party, 16 for the
     Liberal Democrats, and 2 for the Scottish Green Party. Typically all representatives from a
     party vote as a block, so the parliament can be treated like the weighted voting system:
              [65: 47, 46, 17, 16, 2]

     Consider the coalition {P1, P3, P4}. No two players alone could meet the quota, so all three
     players are critical in this coalition.

     In the coalition {P1, P3, P4, P5}, any player except P1 could leave the coalition and it would
     still meet quota, so only P1 is critical in this coalition.

     Notice that a player with veto power will be critical in every winning coalition, since
     removing their support would prevent a proposal from passing.

     Likewise, a dummy will never be critical, since their support will never change a losing
     coalition to a winning one.

         Dictators, Veto, and Dummies and Critical Players
         A player is a dictator if the single-player coalition containing them is a winning
         coalition.
         A player has veto power if they are critical in every winning coalition.
         A player is a dummy if they are not critical in any winning coalition.

 Calculating Power: Banzhaf Power Index
     The Banzhaf power index was originally created in 1946 by Lionel Penrose, but was
     reintroduced by John Banzhaf in 1965. The power index is a numerical way of looking at
     power in a weighted voting situation.

         Calculating Banzhaf Power Index
         To calculate the Banzhaf power index:
         1. List all winning coalitions
         2. In each coalition, identify the players who are critical
         3. Count up how many times each player is critical
         4. Convert these counts to fractions or decimals by dividing by the total times any

             player is critical
                                                                       Weighted Voting 63

Example 4
     Find the Banzhaf power index for the voting system [8: 6, 3, 2].

We start by listing all winning coalitions. If you aren't sure how to do this, you can list all
coalitions, then eliminate the non-winning coalitions. No player is a dictator, so we'll only
consider two and three player coalitions.

{P1, P2}      Total weight: 9. Meets quota.
{P1, P3}      Total weight: 8. Meets quota.
{P2, P3}      Total weight: 5. Does not meet quota.
{P1, P2, P3}  Total weight: 11. Meets quota.

Next we determine which players are critical in each winning coalition. In the winning two-
player coalitions, both players are critical since no player can meet quota alone. Underlining
the critical players to make it easier to count:
{P1, P2}
{P1, P3}

In the three-person coalition, either P2 or P3 could leave the coalition and the remaining
players could still meet quota, so neither is critical. If P1 were to leave, the remaining players
could not reach quota, so P1 is critical.
{P1, P2, P3}

Altogether, P1 is critical 3 times, P2 is critical 1 time, and P3 is critical 1 time.
Converting to percents:
P1 = 3/5 = 60%
P2 = 1/5 = 20%
P3 = 1/5 = 20%

Example 5
     Consider the voting system [16: 7, 6, 3, 3, 2]. Find the Banzhaf power index.

     The winning coalitions are listed below, with the critical players underlined.
     {P1, P2, P3}
     {P1, P2, P4}
     {P1, P2, P3, P4}
     {P1, P2, P3, P5}
     {P1, P2, P4, P5}
     {P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}

     Counting up times that each player is critical:
     P1 = 6
     P2 = 6
     P3 = 2
     P4 = 2
     P5 = 0
     Total of all: 16
64

Divide each player's count by 16 to convert to fractions or percents:

P1 = 6/16 = 3/8 = 37.5%
P2 = 6/16 = 3/8 = 37.5%
P3 = 2/16 = 1/8 = 12.5%
P4 = 2/16 = 1/8 = 12.5%
P5 = 0/16 = 0 = 0%

The Banzhaf power index measures a player's ability to influence the outcome of the vote.
Notice that player 5 has a power index of 0, indicating that there is no coalition in which they
would be critical power and could influence the outcome. This means player 5 is a dummy,
as we noted earlier.

Example 6
     Revisiting the Scottish Parliament, with voting system [65: 47, 46, 17, 16, 2], the winning
     coalitions are listed, with the critical players underlined.

{P1, P2}              {P1, P2, P4}
{P1, P2, P3}          {P1, P3, P4}
{P1, P2, P5}          {P1, P4, P5}
{P1, P3, P5}          {P2, P3, P5}
{P2, P3, P4}          {P1, P2, P3, P5}
{P1, P2, P3, P4}      {P1, P3, P4, P5}
{P1, P2, P4, P5}
{P2, P3, P4, P5}
{P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}

Counting up times that each player is critical:

District                      Times critical     Power index
P1 (Scottish National Party)  9                  9/27 = 33.3%
P2 (Labour Party)             7                  7/27 = 25.9%
P3 (Conservative Party)       5                  5/27 = 18.5%
P4 (Liberal Democrats Party)  3                  3/27 = 11.1%
P5 (Scottish Green Party)     3                  3/27 = 11.1%

Interestingly, even though the Liberal Democrats party has only one less representative than
the Conservative Party, and 14 more than the Scottish Green Party, their Banzhaf power
index is the same as the Scottish Green Party's. In parliamentary governments, forming
coalitions is an essential part of getting results, and a party's ability to help a coalition reach
quota defines its influence.

Example 7

     Banzhaf used this index to argue that the weighted voting system used in the Nassau County
     Board of Supervisors in New York was unfair. The county was divided up into 6 districts,
     each getting voting weight proportional to the population in the district, as shown below.
     Calculate the power index for each district.

                                    {H1, H2, OB, NH, LB, GC}

There are a lot of them! Counting up how many times each player is critical,

District          Times critical  Power index
Hempstead #1      16              16/48 = 1/3 = 33%
Hempstead #2      16              16/48 = 1/3 = 33%
Oyster Bay        16              16/48 = 1/3 = 33%
North Hempstead   0               0/48 = 0%

Glen Cove         0               0/48 = 0%

It turns out that the three smaller districts are dummies. Any winning coalition requires two
of the larger districts.

   The weighted voting system that Americans are most familiar with is the Electoral College
   system used to elect the President. In the Electoral College, states are given a number of
   votes equal to the number of their congressional representatives (house + senate). Most
   states give all their electoral votes to the candidate that wins a majority in their state, turning
   the Electoral College into a weighted voting system, in which the states are the players. As
   I'm sure you can imagine, there are billions of possible winning coalitions, so the power
   index for the Electoral College has to be computed by a computer using approximation
   techniques.

Calculating Power: Shapley-Shubik Power Index
   The Shapley-Shubik power index was introduced in 1954 by economists Lloyd Shapley and
   Martin Shubik, and provides a different approach for calculating power.

   In situations like political alliances, the order in which players join an alliance could be
   considered the most important consideration. In particular, if a proposal is introduced, the
   player that joins the coalition and allows it to reach quota might be considered the most
   essential. The Shapley-Shubik power index counts how likely a player is to be pivotal.
   What does it mean for a player to be pivotal?

   First, we need to change our approach to coalitions. Previously, the coalition {P1, P2} and
   {P2, P1} would be considered equivalent, since they contain the same players. We now need
   to consider the order in which players join the coalition. For that, we will consider
   sequential coalitions - coalitions that contain all the players in which the order players are
   listed reflect the order they joined the coalition. For example, the sequential coalition
   <P2, P1, P3> would mean that P2 joined the coalition first, then P1, and finally P3. The angle
   brackets < > are used instead of curly brackets to distinguish sequential coalitions.

       Pivotal Player
       A sequential coalition lists the players in the order in which they joined the coalition.

       A pivotal player is the player in a sequential coalition that changes a coalition from a
       losing coalition to a winning one. Notice there can only be one pivotal player in any
       sequential coalition.

Example 8
     In the weighted voting system [8: 6, 4, 3, 2], which player is pivotal in the sequential
     coalition <P3, P2, P4, P1>?

The sequential coalition shows the order in which players joined the coalition.  Consider the

running totals as each player joins:

P3              Total weight: 3             Not winning

P3, P2          Total weight: 3+4 = 7       Not winning

P3, P2, P4      Total weight: 3+4+2 = 9     Winning

P3, P2, P4, P1  Total weight: 3+4+2+6 = 15  Winning

Since the coalition becomes winning when P4 joins, P4 is the pivotal player in this coalition.
                                                                               Weighted Voting 67

Calculating Shapley-Shubik Power Index
To calculate the Shapley-Shubik Power Index:
1. List all sequential coalitions
2. In each sequential coalition, determine the pivotal player
3. Count up how many times each player is pivotal
4. Convert these counts to fractions or decimals by dividing by the total number of

    sequential coalitions

     How many sequential coalitions should we expect to have? If there are N players in the
     voting system, then there are N possibilities for the first player in the coalition, N - 1
     possibilities for the second player in the coalition, and so on. Combining these possibilities,
     the total number of coalitions would be: N (N -1)(N - 2)(N - 3)(3)(2)(1) . This calculation
     is called a factorial, and is notated N! The number of sequential coalitions with N players is
     N!

Example 9
     How many sequential coalitions will there be in a voting system with 7 players?

     There will be 7! sequential coalitions. 7! = 7  6 5 4 3 2 1 = 5040

As you can see, computing the Shapley-Shubik power index by hand would be very difficult
for voting systems that are not very small.

Example 10

     Consider the weighted voting system [6: 4, 3, 2]. We will list all the sequential coalitions
     and identify the pivotal player. We will have 3! = 6 sequential coalitions. The coalitions are
     listed, and the pivotal player is underlined.

< P1, P2, P3 >     < P1, P3, P2 >  < P2, P1, P3 >
< P2, P3, P1 >     < P3, P2, P1 >  < P3, P1, P2 >

P1 is pivotal 4 times, P2 is pivotal 1 time, and P3 is pivotal 1 time.

Player          Times pivotal Power index

P1              4                  4/6 = 66.7%

P2              1                  1/6 = 16.7%

P3              1                  1/6 = 16.7%

For comparison, the Banzhaf power index for the same weighted voting system would be P1:
60%, P2: 20%, P3: 20%. While the Banzhaf power index and Shapley-Shubik power index
are usually not terribly different, the two different approaches usually produce somewhat
different results.

1. If we represent the players as M1, M2, M3, M4, U1, U2, U3, then we may be tempted to set up a
system like [4: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. While this system would meet the first requirement that
four members must support a proposal for it to pass, this does not satisfy the requirement that
at least one member of the union must support it.

To accomplish that, we might try increasing the voting weight of the union members: [5: 1,
1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]. The quota was set at 5 so that the four management members alone would
not be able to reach quota without one of the union members. Unfortunately, now the three
union members can reach quota alone. To fix this, three management members need to have
more weight than two union members.

After trying several other guesses, we land on the system [13: 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]. Here, the
four management members have combined weight of 12, so cannot reach quota. Likewise,
the three union members have combined weight of 12, so cannot reach quota alone. But, as
required, any group of 4 members that includes at least one union member will reach the
quota of 13. For example, three management members and one union member have
combined weight of 3+3+3+4=13, and reach quota.

2. In the voting system [q: 10, 5, 3], if the quota is 10, then player 1 is a dictator since they
can reach quota without the support of the other players. This makes the other two players
automatically dummies.

If the quota is 12, then player 1 is necessary to reach quota, so has veto power. Since at this
point either player 2 or player 3 would allow player 1 to reach quota, neither player is a
dummy, so they are regular players (not dictators, no veto power, and not a dummy).

If the quota is 16, then no two players alone can reach quota, so all three players have veto
power.

3. The voting system tells us that the quota is 36, that Player 1 has 20 votes (or equivalently,
has a weight of 20), Player 2 has 17 votes, Player 3 has 16 votes, and Player 4 has 3 votes.

A coalition is any group of one or more players. What we're looking for is winning coalitions
- coalitions whose combined votes (weights) add to up to the quota or more. So the coalition
{P3, P4} is not a winning coalition because the combined weight is 16+3=19, which is below
the quota.

So we look at each possible combination of players and identify the winning ones:
                                                                          Weighted Voting 69

{P1, P2} (weight: 37)              {P1, P3} (weight: 36)
{P1, P2, P3} (weight: 53)          {P1, P2, P4} (weight: 40)
{P1, P3, P4} (weight: 39)          {P1, P2, P3, P4} (weight: 56)
{P2, P3, P4} (weight: 36)

Now, in each coalition, we need to identify which players are critical. A player is critical if
the coalition would no longer reach quota without that person. So, in the coalition {P1, P2},
both players are necessary to reach quota, so both are critical. However in the coalition {P1,
P2, P3}, we can see from the earlier two coalitions that either P2 or P3 could leave the
coalition and it would still reach quota. But if P1 left, it would not reach quota, so P1 is the
only player critical in this coalition. We evaluate the rest of the coalitions similarly, giving us
this (underlining the critical players)

{P1, P2}                           {P1, P3}
{P1, P2, P3}                       {P1, P2, P4}
{P1, P3, P4}                       {P1, P2, P3, P4}
{P2, P3, P4}

Next we count how many times each player is critical:
P1: 5 times
P2: 3 times
P3: 3 times
P4: 1 time

In total, there were 5+3+3+1 = 12 times anyone was critical, so we take our counts and turn
them into fractions, giving us our Banzhaf power:
P1: 5/12
P2: 3/12 = 1/4
P3: 3/12 = 1/4
P4: 1/12

[36: 20, 17, 15].

4. Listing all sequential coalitions and identifying the pivotal player:

< P1, P2, P3 >     < P1, P3, P2 >  < P2, P1, P3 >
< P2, P3, P1 >     < P3, P2, P1 >  < P3, P1, P2 >

P1 is pivotal 3 times, P2 is pivotal 3 times, and P3 is pivotal 0 times.

Player             Times pivotal   Power index
P1                 3               3/6 = 50%
P2                 3               3/6 = 50%
P3                 0               0/6 = 0%

Exploration

30. In the U.S., the Electoral College is used in presidential elections. Each state is
    awarded a number of electors equal to the number of representatives (based on
    population) and senators (2 per state) they have in congress. Since most states award
    the winner of the popular vote in their state all their state's electoral votes, the
    Electoral College acts as a weighted voting system. To explore how the Electoral
    College works, we'll look at a mini-country with only 4 states. Here is the outcome
    of a hypothetical election:

State        Smalota  Medigan  Bigonia  Hugodo
Population   50,000   70,000   100,000  240,000
Votes for A  40,000   50,000   80,000   50,000
Votes for B  10,000   20,000   20,000   190,000

a. If this country did not use an Electoral College, which candidate would win the
    election?

b. Suppose that each state gets 1 electoral vote for every 10,000 people. Set up a
    weighted voting system for this scenario, calculate the Banzhaf power index for
    each state, then calculate the winner if each state awards all their electoral votes to
    the winner of the election in their state.

c. Suppose that each state gets 1 electoral vote for every 10,000 people, plus an
    additional 2 votes. Set up a weighted voting system for this scenario, calculate
    the Banzhaf power index for each state, then calculate the winner if each state
    awards all their electoral votes to the winner of the election in their state.

d. Suppose that each state gets 1 electoral vote for every 10,000 people, and awards
    them based on the number of people who voted for each candidate. Additionally,
    they get 2 votes that are awarded to the majority winner in the state. Calculate the
    winner under these conditions.

e. Does it seem like an individual state has more power in the Electoral College
    under the vote distribution from part c or from part d?

f. Research the history behind the Electoral College to explore why the system was
    introduced instead of using a popular vote. Based on your research and

    system is or is not fair.

                              Apportionment 75

Apportionment

     Apportionment is the problem of dividing up a fixed number of things among groups of
     different sizes. In politics, this takes the form of allocating a limited number of
     representatives amongst voters. This problem, presumably, is older than the United States,
     but the best-known ways to solve it have their origins in the problem of assigning each state
     an appropriate number of representatives in the new Congress when the country was formed.
     States also face this apportionment problem in defining how to draw districts for state
     representatives. The apportionment problem comes up in a variety of non-political areas too,
     though. We face several restrictions in this process:

         Apportionment rules
         1. The things being divided up can exist only in whole numbers.
         2. We must use all of the things being divided up, and we cannot use any more.
         3. Each group must get at least one of the things being divided up.
         4. The number of things assigned to each group should be at least approximately

             proportional to the population of the group. (Exact proportionality isn't possible
             because of the whole number requirement, but we should try to be close, and in any
             case, if Group A is larger than Group B, then Group B shouldn't get more of the
             things than Group A does.)

     In terms of the apportionment of the United States House of Representatives, these rules
     imply:

         1. We can only have whole representatives (a state can't have 3.4 representatives)
         2. We can only use the (currently) 435 representatives available. If one state gets

              another representative, another state has to lose one.
         3. Every state gets at least one representative
         4. The number of representatives each state gets should be approximately proportional

              to the state population. This way, the number of constituents each representative has
              should be approximately equal.

     We will look at four ways of solving the apportionment problem. Three of them (Lowndes's
     method is the exception) have been used at various times to apportion the U.S. Congress,
     although the method currently in use (the Huntington-Hill method) is significantly more
     complicated.

 Hamilton's Method
     Alexander Hamilton proposed the method that now bears his name. His method was
     approved by Congress in 1791, but was vetoed by President Washington. It was later
     adopted in 1852 and used through 1911. He begins by determining, to several decimal
     places, how many things each group should get. Since he was interested in the question of
     Congressional representation, we'll use the language of states and representatives, so he
     determines how many representatives each state should get. He follows these steps:

76

   Hamilton's Method
   1. Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by

        dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives.
        This answer is called the divisor.

   2. Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many
        representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This
        answer is called the quota.

   Since we can only allocate whole representatives, Hamilton resolves the whole number
   problem, as follows:

   3. Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don't forget what the decimals
        were). These are called the lower quotas. Add up the remaining whole numbers.
        This answer will always be less than or equal to the total number of representatives
        (and the "or equal to" part happens only in very specific circumstances that are
        incredibly unlikely to turn up).

   4. Assuming that the total from Step 3 was less than the total number of
        representatives, assign the remaining representatives, one each, to the states whose
        decimal parts of the quota were largest, until the desired total is reached.

   Make sure that each state ends up with at least one representative!

Note on rounding: Today we have technological advantages that Hamilton (and the others)
couldn't even have imagined. Take advantage of them, and keep several decimal places.

Example 1

     The state of Delaware has three counties: Kent, New Castle, and Sussex. The Delaware
     state House of Representatives has 41 members. If Delaware wants to divide this
     representation along county lines (which is not required, but let's pretend they do), let's use
     Hamilton's method to apportion them. The populations of the counties are as follows (from
     the 2010 Census):

County      Population
Kent          162,310
New Castle    538,479
Sussex        197,145
Total         897,934

1. First, we determine the divisor: 897,934/41 = 21,900.82927

2. Now we determine each county's quota by dividing the county's population by the
divisor:
                                                             Appportionment 77

County      Population  Quota
Kent          162,310    7.4111
New Castle    538,479   24.5872
Sussex        197,145    9.0017
Total         897,934

3. Removing the decimal parts of the quotas gives:

County      Population  Quota                       Initial
Kent          162,310    7.4111                       7

Total         897,934                                40

4. We need 41 representatives and this only gives 40. The remaining one goes to the county
with the largest decimal part, which is New Castle:

County      Population  Quota                       Initial  Final
Kent          162,310    7.4111                        7        7
New Castle    538,479   24.5872                      24       25
Sussex        197,145    9.0017                        9        9
Total         897,934                                40

Example 2
     Use Hamilton's method to apportion the 75 seats of Rhode Island's House of Representatives
     among its five counties.

County      Population
Bristol        49,875
Kent          166,158
Newport        82,888
Providence    626,667
Washington    126,979
Total
            1,052,567

1. The divisor is 1,052,567/75 = 14,034.22667

2. Determine each county's quota by dividing its population by the divisor:

County      Population  Quota
Bristol        49,875    3.5538
Kent          166,158   11.8395
Newport        82,888    5.9061
Providence    626,667   44.6528
Washington    126,979    9.0478
Total
            1,052,567
78

3. Remove the decimal part of each quota:

    County      Population                 Quota    Initial
    Bristol        49,875                   3.5538     3
    Kent          166,158                  11.8395    11
    Newport        82,888                   5.9061     5
    Providence    626,667                  44.6528    44
    Washington    126,979                   9.0478     9
    Total                                             72
                1,052,567

4. We need 75 representatives and we only have 72, so we assign the remaining three, one
each, to the three counties with the largest decimal parts, which are Newport, Kent, and
Providence:

    County      Population                 Quota    Initial  Final
    Bristol        49,875                   3.5538     3        3
    Kent          166,158                  11.8395    11      12
    Newport        82,888                   5.9061     5        6
    Providence    626,667                  44.6528    44      45
    Washington    126,979                   9.0478     9        9
    Total                                             72      75
                1,052,567

Note that even though Bristol County's decimal part is greater than .5, it isn't big enough to
get an additional representative, because three other counties have greater decimal parts.

Hamilton's method obeys something called the Quota Rule. The Quota Rule isn't a law of
any sort, but just an idea that some people, including Hamilton, think is a good one.

    Quota Rule
    The Quota Rule says that the final number of representatives a state gets should be
    within one of that state's quota. Since we're dealing with whole numbers for our final
    answers, that means that each state should either go up to the next whole number above
    its quota, or down to the next whole number below its quota.

Controversy

After seeing Hamilton's method, many people find that it makes sense, it's not that difficult
to use (or, at least, the difficulty comes from the numbers that are involved and the amount of
computation that's needed, not from the method), and they wonder why anyone would want
another method. The problem is that Hamilton's method is subject to several paradoxes.
Three of them happened, on separate occasions, when Hamilton's method was used to
apportion the United States House of Representatives.
                                                                                       Appportionment 79

   The Alabama Paradox is named for an incident that happened during the apportionment that
   took place after the 1880 census. (A similar incident happened ten years earlier involving the
   state of Rhode Island, but the paradox is named after Alabama.) The post-1880
   apportionment had been completed, using Hamilton's method and the new population
   numbers from the census. Then it was decided that because of the country's growing
   population, the House of Representatives should be made larger. That meant that the
   apportionment would need to be done again, still using Hamilton's method and the same
   1880 census numbers, but with more representatives. The assumption was that some states
   would gain another representative and others would stay with the same number they already
   had (since there weren't enough new representatives being added to give one more to every
   state). The paradox is that Alabama ended up losing a representative in the process, even
   though no populations were changed and the total number of representatives increased.

   The New States Paradox happened when Oklahoma became a state in 1907. Oklahoma had
   enough population to qualify for five representatives in Congress. Those five representatives
   would need to come from somewhere, though, so five states, presumably, would lose one
   representative each. That happened, but another thing also happened: Maine gained a
   representative (from New York).

   The Population Paradox happened between the apportionments after the census of 1900 and
   of 1910. In those ten years, Virginia's population grew at an average annual rate of 1.07%,
   while Maine's grew at an average annual rate of 0.67%. Virginia started with more people,
   grew at a faster rate, grew by more people, and ended up with more people than Maine. By
   itself, that doesn't mean that Virginia should gain representatives or Maine shouldn't,
   because there are lots of other states involved. But Virginia ended up losing a representative
   to Maine.

Jefferson's Method

   Thomas Jefferson proposed a different method for apportionment. After Washington vetoed
   Hamilton's method, Jefferson's method was adopted, and used in Congress from 1791
   through 1842. Jefferson, of course, had political reasons for wanting his method to be used
   rather than Hamilton's. Primarily, his method favors larger states, and his own home state of
   Virginia was the largest in the country at the time. He would also argue that it's the ratio of
   people to representatives that is the critical thing, and apportionment methods should be
   based on that. But the paradoxes we saw also provide mathematical reasons for concluding
   that Hamilton's method isn't so good, and while Jefferson's method might or might not be
   the best one to replace it, at least we should look for other possibilities.

   The first steps of Jefferson's method are the same as Hamilton's method. He finds the same
   divisor and the same quota, and cuts off the decimal parts in the same way, giving a total
   number of representatives that is less than the required total. The difference is in how
   Jefferson resolves that difference. He says that since we ended up with an answer that is too
   small, our divisor must have been too big. He changes the divisor by making it smaller,
   finding new quotas with the new divisor, cutting off the decimal parts, and looking at the new
   total, until we find a divisor that produces the required total.
80

   Jefferson's Method
   1. Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by

        dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives.
        This answer is called the standard divisor.

   2. Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many
        representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This
        answer is called the quota.

   3. Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don't forget what the decimals
        were). These are the lower quotas. Add up the remaining whole numbers. This
        answer will always be less than or equal to the total number of representatives.

   4. If the total from Step 3 was less than the total number of representatives, reduce the
        divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. Continue doing this until the total
        in Step 3 is equal to the total number of representatives. The divisor we end up
        using is called the modified divisor or adjusted divisor.

Example 3
     We'll return to Delaware and apply Jefferson's method. We begin, as we did with
     Hamilton's method, by finding the quotas with the original divisor, 21,900.82927:

County      Population  Quota    Initial
Kent          162,310    7.4111     7
New Castle    538,479   24.5872    24
Sussex        197,145    9.0017     9
Total         897,934             40

We need 41 representatives, and this divisor gives only 40. We must reduce the divisor until
we get 41 representatives. Let's try 21,500 as the divisor:

County      Population  Quota    Initial
Kent          162,310    7.5493     7
New Castle    538,479   25.0455    25
Sussex        197,145    9.1695     9
Total         897,934             41

This gives us the required 41 representatives, so we're done. If we had fewer than 41, we'd
need to reduce the divisor more. If we had more than 41, we'd need to choose a divisor less
than the original but greater than the second choice.

Notice that with the new, lower divisor, the quota for New Castle County (the largest county
in the state) increased by much more than those of Kent County or Sussex County.

Example 4
     We'll apply Jefferson's method for Rhode Island. The original divisor of 14,034.22667 gave
     these results:

             County      Population  Quota     Initial
             Bristol        49,875    3.5538      3
             Kent          166,158   11.8395     11
             Newport        82,888    5.9061      5
             Providence    626,667   44.6528     44
             Washington    126,979    9.0478      9
             Total                               72
                         1,052,567

We need 75 representatives and we only have 72, so we need to use a smaller divisor. Let's
try 13,500:

             County      Population  Quota     Initial
             Bristol        49,875     3.6944     3
             Kent          166,158   12.3080    12
             Newport        82,888     6.1399     6
             Providence    626,667   46.4198    46
             Washington    126,979     9.4059     9
             Total                              76
                         1,052,567

We've gone too far. We need a divisor that's greater than 13,500 but less than 14,034.22667.
Let's try 13,700:

             County      Population  Quota     Initial
             Bristol        49,875     3.6405     3
             Kent          166,158   12.1283     12
             Newport        82,888     6.0502     6
             Providence    626,667   45.7421     45
             Washington    126,979     9.2685     9
             Total                               75
                         1,052,567

This works.

Notice, in comparison to Hamilton's method, that although the results were the same, they
came about in a different way, and the outcome was almost different. Providence County
(the largest) almost went up to 46 representatives before Kent (which is much smaller) got to
12. Although that didn't happen here, it can. Divisor-adjusting methods like Jefferson's are
not guaranteed to follow the quota rule!
82

Webster's Method

   Daniel Webster (1782-1852) proposed a method similar to Jefferson's in 1832. It was
   adopted by Congress in 1842, but replaced by Hamilton's method in 1852. It was then
   adopted again in 1901. The difference is that Webster rounds the quotas to the nearest whole
   number rather than dropping the decimal parts. If that doesn't produce the desired results at
   the beginning, he says, like Jefferson, to adjust the divisor until it does. (In Jefferson's case,
   at least the first adjustment will always be to make the divisor smaller. That is not always the
   case with Webster's method.)

    Webster's Method
    1. Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by

        dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives.
        This answer is called the standard divisor.

    2. Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many
        representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This
        answer is called the quota.

    3. Round all the quotas to the nearest whole number (but don't forget what the
        decimals were). Add up the remaining whole numbers.

    4. If the total from Step 3 was less than the total number of representatives, reduce the
        divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If the total from step 3 was larger
        than the total number of representatives, increase the divisor and recalculate the
        quota and allocation. Continue doing this until the total in Step 3 is equal to the
        total number of representatives. The divisor we end up using is called the modified
        divisor or adjusted divisor.

Example 5
     Again, Delaware, with an initial divisor of 21,900.82927:

    County      Population                     Quota            Initial
    Kent          162,310                       7.4111            7
    New Castle    538,479                      24.5872           25
    Sussex        197,145                       9.0017             9
    Total         897,934                                        41

This gives the required total, so we're done.

     Again, Rhode Island, with an initial divisor of 14,034.22667:

Bristol                        49,875    3.5538     4
Kent                          166,158   11.8395    12

                            1,052,567

This is too many, so we need to increase the divisor. Let's try 14,100:

County                      Population  Quota    Initial
Bristol                        49,875    3.5372     4
Kent                          166,158   11.7843    12
Newport                        82,888    5.8786     6
Providence                    626,667   44.4445     44

                            1,052,567

This works, so we're done.

Like Jefferson's method, Webster's method carries a bias in favor of states with large
populations, but rounding the quotas to the nearest whole number greatly reduces this bias.
(Notice that Providence County, the largest, is the one that gets a representative trimmed
because of the increased quota.) Also like Jefferson's method, Webster's method does not
always follow the quota rule, but it follows the quota rule much more often than Jefferson's
method does. (In fact, if Webster's method had been applied to every apportionment of
Congress in all of American history, it would have followed the quota rule every single
time.)

In 1980, two mathematicians, Peyton Young and Mike Balinski, proved what we now call
the Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem.

Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem
The Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem shows that any apportionment method
which always follows the quota rule will be subject to the possibility of paradoxes like
the Alabama, New States, or Population paradoxes. In other words, we can choose a
method that avoids those paradoxes, but only if we are willing to give up the guarantee
of following the quota rule.
   84

Huntington-Hill Method
   In 1920, no new apportionment was done, because Congress couldn't agree on the method to
   be used. They appointed a committee of mathematicians to investigate, and they
   recommended the Huntington-Hill Method. They continued to use Webster's method in
   1931, but after a second report recommending Huntington-Hill, it was adopted in 1941 and is
   the current method of apportionment used in Congress.

   The Huntington-Hill Method is similar to Webster's method, but attempts to minimize the
   percent differences of how many people each representative will represent.

Huntington-Hill Method
1. Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by

    dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives.
    This answer is called the standard divisor.

2. Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many
    representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This
    answer is called the quota.

3. Cut off the decimal part of the quota to obtain the lower quota, which we'll call n.
    Compute n(n + 1) , which is the geometric mean of the lower quota and one
    value higher.

4. If the quota is larger than the geometric mean, round up the quota; if the quota is
    smaller than the geometric mean, round down the quota. Add up the resulting
    whole numbers to get the initial allocation.

5. If the total from Step 4 was less than the total number of representatives, reduce the
    divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If the total from step 4 was larger
    than the total number of representatives, increase the divisor and recalculate the
    quota and allocation. Continue doing this until the total in Step 4 is equal to the
    total number of representatives. The divisor we end up using is called the modified
    divisor or adjusted divisor.

                   1,052,567

This is too many, so we need to increase the divisor. Let's try 14,100:

       County      Population  Quota    Lower Quota                 Geom Mean  Initial
       Bristol        49,875    3.5372  3                           3.46       4

                   1,052,567

This works, so we're done.

In both these cases, the apportionment produced by the Huntington-Hill method was the
same as those from Webster's method.

Example 9

     Consider a small country with 5 states, two of which are much larger than the others. We
     need to apportion 70 representatives. We will apportion using both Webster's method and
     the Huntington-Hill method.

State  Population
A         300,500
B         200,000
C          50,000
D          38,000
E          21,500

1. The total population is 610,000. Dividing this by the 70 representatives gives the divisor:
   8714.286

2. Dividing each state's population by the divisor gives the quotas
86

State  Population     Quota
A         300,500  34.48361
B         200,000  22.95082
C          50,000  5.737705
D          38,000  4.360656
E          21,500  2.467213

Webster's Method
3. Using Webster's method, we round each quota to the nearest whole number

State  Population     Quota  Initial
A         300,500  34.48361      34
B         200,000  22.95082      23
C          50,000  5.737705       6
D          38,000  4.360656       4
E          21,500  2.467213       2

4. Adding these up, they only total 69 representatives, so we adjust the divisor down.
   Adjusting the divisor down to 8700 gives an updated allocation totaling 70 representatives

State  Population     Quota  Initial
A         300,500  34.54023      35
B         200,000  22.98851      23
C          50,000  5.747126       6
D          38,000  4.367816       4
E          21,500  2.471264       2

Huntington-Hill Method
3. Using the Huntington-Hill method, we round down to find the lower quota, then calculate

   the geometric mean based on each lower quota. If the quota is less than the geometric
   mean, we round down; if the quota is more than the geometric mean, we round up.

State Population Quota       Lower    Geometric  Initial
                             Quota         Mean
A      300,500 34.48361                              34
                                 34    34.49638      23
B      200,000 22.95082          22    22.49444       6
                                   5   5.477226       4

D      38,000 4.360656

E      21,500 2.467213

These allocations add up to 70, so we're done.

Notice that this allocation is different than that produced by Webster's method. In this case,
state E got the extra seat instead of state A.
                                                                                       Appportionment 87

Lowndes' Method
   William Lowndes (1782-1822) was a Congressman from South Carolina (a small state) who
   proposed a method of apportionment that was more favorable to smaller states. Unlike the
   methods of Hamilton, Jefferson, and Webster, Lowndes's method has never been used to
   apportion Congress.

   Lowndes believed that an additional representative was much more valuable to a small state
   than to a large one. If a state already has 20 or 30 representatives, getting one more doesn't
   matter very much. But if it only has 2 or 3, one more is a big deal, and he felt that the
   additional representatives should go where they could make the most difference.

   Like Hamilton's method, Lowndes's method follows the quota rule. In fact, it arrives at the
   same quotas as Hamilton and the rest, and like Hamilton and Jefferson, it drops the decimal
   parts. But in deciding where the remaining representatives should go, we divide the decimal
   part of each state's quota by the whole number part (so that the same decimal part with a
   smaller whole number is worth more, because it matters more to that state).

Lowndes's Method
1. Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by

    dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives.
    This answer is called the divisor.

2. Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many
    representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This
    answer is called the quota.

3. Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don't forget what the decimals
    were). Add up the remaining whole numbers.

4. Assuming that the total from Step 3 was less than the total number of
    representatives, divide the decimal part of each state's quota by the whole number
    part. Assign the remaining representatives, one each, to the states whose ratio of
    decimal part to whole part were largest, until the desired total is reached.

Example 10
     We'll do Delaware again. We begin in the same way as with Hamilton's method:

County      Population  Quota    Initial
Kent          162,310    7.4111     7
New Castle    538,479   24.5872   24
Sussex        197,145    9.0017     9
Total         897,934             40
88

We need one more representative. To find out which county should get it, Lowndes says to
divide each county's decimal part by its whole number part, with the largest result getting the
extra representative:

    Kent:        0.4111/7  0.0587
    New Castle:  0.5872/24  0.0245
    Sussex:      0.0017/9  0.0002

The largest of these is Kent's, so Kent gets the 41st representative:

    County       Population          Quota     Initial                 Ratio          Final
    Kent           162,310            7.4111      7                    0.0587            8
    New Castle     538,479           24.5872    24                     0.0245          24
    Sussex         197,145            9.0017      9                    0.0002            9
    Total          897,934                      40                                     41

Example 11
     Rhode Island, again beginning in the same way as Hamilton:

    County       Population  Quota    Initial
    Bristol         49,875    3.5538     3
    Kent           166,158   11.8395     11
    Newport         82,888    5.9061     5
    Providence     626,667   44.6528     44
    Washington     126,979    9.0478     9
    Total                               72
                 1,052,567

We divide each county's quota's decimal part by its whole number part to determine which
three should get the remaining representatives:

    Bristol:     0.5538/3    0.1846
    Kent:        0.8395/11   0.0763
    Newport:     0.9061/5    0.1812
    Providence:  0.6528/44   0.0148
    Washington:  0.0478/9    0.0053

The three largest of these are Bristol, Newport, and Kent, so they get the remaining three
representatives:

    County       Population  Quota    Initial  Ratio                           Final
    Bristol         49,875    3.5538     3      0.1846                            4

     As you can see, there is no "right answer" when it comes to choosing a method for
     apportionment. Each method has its virtues, and favors different sized states.

 Apportionment of Legislative Districts
     In most states, there are a fixed number of representatives to the state legislature. Rather than
     apportioning each county a number of representatives, legislative districts are drawn so that
     each legislator represents a district. The apportionment process, then, comes in the drawing
     of the legislative districts, with the goal of having each district include approximately the
     same number of constituents. Because of this goal, a geographically small city may have
     several representatives, while a large rural region may be represented by one legislator.

     When populations change, it becomes necessary to redistrict the regions each legislator
     represents (Incidentally, this also occurs for the regions that federal legislators represent).
     The process of redistricting is typically done by the legislature itself, so not surprisingly it is
     common to see gerrymandering.

         Gerrymandering
         Gerrymandering is when districts are drawn based on the political affiliation of the
         constituents to the advantage of those drawing the boundary.

Example 12
     Consider three districts, simplified to the three boxes below. On the left there is a college
     area that typically votes Democratic. On the right is a rural area that typically votes
     Republican. The rest of the people are more evenly split. The middle district has been
     voting 50% Democratic and 50% Republican.

College

         Rural

As part of a redistricting, a Democratic led committee could redraw the boundaries so that
the middle district includes less of the typically Republican voters, thereby making it more
likely that their party will win in that district, while increasing the Republican majority in the
third district.

Example 13

     The map to the right shows the 38th
     congressional district in California in
     20041. This district was created through
     a bi-partisan committee of incumbent
     legislators. This gerrymandering leads
     to districts that are not competitive; the
     prevailing party almost always wins with
     a large margin.

     The map to the right shows the 4th
     congressional district in Illinois in 2004.2
     This district was drawn to contain the two
     predominantly Hispanic areas of Chicago.
     The largely Puerto Rican area to the north
     and the southern Mexican areas are only
     connected in this districting by a piece of
     the highway to the west.

Exploration
13. Explore and describe the similarities, differences, and interplay between weighted voting,

    fair division (if you've studied it yet), and apportionment.

14. In the methods discussed in the text, it was assumed that the number of seats being
    apportioned was fixed. Suppose instead that the number of seats could be adjusted
    slightly, perhaps 10% up or down. Create a method for apportioning that incorporates
    this additional freedom, and describe why you feel it is the best approach. Apply your
    method to the apportionment in Exercise 7.

15. Lowndes felt that small states deserved additional seats more than larger states. Suppose
    you were a legislator from a larger state, and write an argument refuting Lowndes.

16. Research how apportionment of legislative seats is done in other countries around the
    world. What are the similarities and differences compared to how the United States
    apportions congress?

17. Adams's method is similar to Jefferson's method, but rounds quotas up rather than down.
    This means we usually need a modified divisor that is smaller than the standard divisor.
    Rework problems 1-8 using Adam's method. Which other method are the results most
    similar to?
                 Fair Division 93

Fair Division

     Whether it is two kids sharing a candy bar or a couple splitting assets during a divorce, there
     are times in life where items of value need to be divided between two or more parties. While
     some cases can be handled through mutual agreement or mediation, in others the parties are
     adversarial or cannot reach a decision all feel is fair. In these cases, fair division methods
     can be utilized.

         Fair Division Method
         A fair division method is a procedure that can be followed that will result in a division
         of items in a way so that each party feels they have received their fair share. For these
         methods to work, we have to make a few assumptions:
         · The parties are non-cooperative, so the method must operate without

             communication between the parties.
         · The parties have no knowledge of what the other players like (their valuations).
         · The parties act rationally, meaning they act in their best interest, and do not make

             emotional decisions.
         · The method should allow the parties to make a fair division without requiring an

             outside arbitrator or other intervention.

With these methods, each party will be entitled to some fair share. When there are N parties
equally dividing something, that fair share would be 1/N. For example, if there were 4
parties, each would be entitled to a fair share of ¼ = 25% of the whole. More specifically,
they are entitled to a share that they value as 25% of the whole.

   Fair Share
   When N parties divide something equally, each party's fair share is the amount they
   entitled to. As a fraction, it will be 1/N

It should be noted that a fair division method simply needs to guarantee that each party will
receive a share they view as fair. A basic fair division does not need to be envy free; an
envy-free division is one in which no party would prefer another party's share over their
own. A basic fair division also does not need to be Pareto optimal; a Pareto optimal
division is one in which no other division would make a participant better off without making
someone else worse off. Nor does fair division have to be equitable; an equitable division is
one in which the proportion of the whole each party receives, judged by their own valuation,
is the same. Basically, a simple fair division doesn't have to be the best possible division - it
just has to give each party their fair share.

Example 1
     Suppose that 4 classmates are splitting equally a $12 pizza that is half pepperoni, half veggie
     that someone else bought them. What is each person's fair share?

Since they all are splitting the pizza equally, each person's fair share is $3, or pieces they
value as 25% of the pizza.

     It is important to keep in mind that each party might value portions of the whole differently.
     For example, a vegetarian would probably put zero value on the pepperoni half of the pizza.

Example 2
     Suppose that 4 classmates are splitting equally a $12 pizza that is half pepperoni, half veggie.
     Steve likes pepperoni twice as much as veggie. Describe a fair share for Steve.

     He would value the veggie half as being worth $4 and the pepperoni half as $8, twice as
     much. If the pizza was divided up into 4 pepperoni slices and 4 veggie slices, he would value
     a pepperoni slice as being worth $2, and a veggie slice as being worth $1.

     If we weren't able to guess the values, we could take a more algebraic approach. If Steve
     values a veggie slice as worth x dollars, then he'd value a pepperoni slice as worth 2x dollars
     - twice as much. Four veggie slices would be worth 4·x = 4x dollars, and 4 pepperoni slices
     would be worth 4·2x = 8x dollars. Altogether, the eight slices would be worth 4x + 8x = 12x
     dollars. Since the total value of the pizza was $12, then 12x = $12. Solving we get x = $1;
     the value of a veggie slice is $1, and the value of a pepperoni slice is 2x = $2.

     A fair share for Steve would be one pepperoni slice and one veggie slice ($2 + $1 = $3
     value), 1½ pepperoni slices (1½ · $2 = $3 value), 3 veggie slices (3 · $1 = $3 value), or a
     variety of more complicated possibilities.

     Suppose Kim is another classmate splitting the pizza, but Kim is vegetarian, so won't eat
     pepperoni. Describe a fair share for Kim.

     You will find that many examples and exercises in this topic involve dividing food - dividing
     candy, cutting cakes, sharing pizza, etc. This may make this topic seem somewhat trivial, but
     instead of cutting a cake, we might be drawing borders dividing Germany after WWII.
     Instead of splitting a bag of candy, siblings might be dividing belongings from an
     inheritance. Mathematicians often characterize very important and contentious issues in
     terms of simple items like cake to separate any emotional influences from the mathematical
     method.

     Because of this, our requirement that the players not communicate about their preferences
     can seem silly. After all, why wouldn't four classmates talk about what kind of pizza they
     like if they're splitting a pizza? Just remember that in issues of politics, business, finance,
     divorce settlements, etc. the players are usually less cooperative and more concerned about
     the other players trying to get more than their fair share.

     There are two broad classifications of fair division methods: those that apply to
     continuously divisible items, and those that apply to discretely divisible items.
     Continuously divisible items are things that can be divided into pieces of any size, like
     dividing a candy bar into two pieces or drawing borders to split a piece of land into smaller
     plots. Discretely divisible items are when you are dividing several items that cannot be
     broken apart easily, such as assets in a divorce (house, car, furniture, etc).

 Divider-Chooser
     The first method we will look at is a method for continuously divisible items. This method
     will be familiar to many parents - it is the "You cut, I choose" method. In this method, one
     party is designated the divider and the other the chooser, perhaps with a coin toss. The
     method works as follows:

         Divider-Chooser Method
         1. The divider cuts the item into two pieces that are, in his eyes, equal in value.
         2. The chooser selects either of the two pieces
         3. The divider receives the remaining piece

     Notice that the divider-chooser method is specific to a two-party division. Examine why this
     method guarantees a fair division: since the divider doesn't know which piece he will
     receive, the rational action for him to take would be to divide the whole into two pieces he
     values equally. There is no incentive for the divider to attempt to "cheat" since he doesn't
     know which piece he will receive. Since the chooser can pick either piece, she is guaranteed
     that one of them is worth at least 50% of the whole in her eyes. The chooser is guaranteed a
     piece she values as at least 50%, and the divider is guaranteed a piece he values at 50%.

Example 3
     Two retirees, Fred and Martha, buy a vacation beach house in Florida together, with the
     agreement that they will split the year into two parts.

     Fred is chosen to be the divider, and splits the year into two pieces: November - February
     and March - October. Even though the first piece is 4 months and the second is 8 months,
     Fred places equal value on both pieces since he really likes to be in Florida during the winter.
     Martha gets to pick whichever piece she values more. Suppose she values all months
     equally. In this case, she would choose the March - October time, resulting in a piece that
     she values as 8/12 = 66.7% of the whole. Fred is left with the November - February slot
     which he values as 50% of the whole.

     Of course, in this example, Fred and Martha probably could have discussed their preferences
     and reached a mutually agreeable decision. The divider-chooser method is more necessary in
     cases where the parties are suspicious of each other's motives, or are unable to communicate
     effectively, such as two countries drawing a border, or two children splitting a candy bar.

Dustin and Quinn were given an apple pie and a chocolate cake, and need to divide them.
Dustin values the apple pie at $6 and the chocolate cake at $4. Quinn values the apple pie as
$4 and the chocolate cake at $10. Describe a fair division if Quinn is dividing, and specify
which "half" Dustin will choose.

   Things quickly become more complicated when we have more than two parties involved.
   We will look at three different approaches. But first, let us look at one that doesn't work.

How not to divide with 3 parties
   When first approaching the question of 3-party fair division, it is very tempting to propose
   this method: Randomly designate one participant to be the divider, and designate the rest
   choosers. Proceed as follows:
        1) Have the divider divide the item into 3 pieces
        2) Have the first chooser select any of the three pieces they feel is worth a fair share
        3) Have the second chooser select either of the remaining pieces
        4) The divider gets the piece left.

Example 4. Don't do this - it is bad!

     Suppose we have three people splitting a cake. We can immediately see that the divider will
     receive a fair share as long as they cut the cake fairly at the beginning. The first chooser
     certainly will also receive a fair share. What about the second chooser? Suppose each
     person values the three pieces like this:

Chooser 1  Piece 1  Piece 2  Piece 3
Chooser 2  40%      30%      30%
Divider    45%      30%      25%
           33.3%    33.3%    33.3%

Since the first chooser will clearly select Piece 1, the second chooser is left to select between
Piece 2 and Piece 3, neither of which she values as a fair share (1/3 or about 33.3%). This
example shows that this method does not guarantee a fair division.

   To handle division with 3 or more parties, we'll have to take a more clever approach.

Lone Divider
   The lone divider method works for any number of parties - we will use N for the number of
   parties. One participant is randomly designated the divider, and the rest of the participants
   are designated as choosers.
                                                                                    Fair Division 97

Lone Divider Method
The Lone Divider method proceeds as follows:

    1) The divider divides the item into N pieces, which we'll label s1, s2, ..., sN.
    2) Each of the choosers will separately list which pieces they consider to be a fair

        share. This is called their declaration, or bid.
    3) The lists are examined. There are two possibilities:

        a. If it is possible to give each party a piece they declared then do so, and the
             divider gets the remaining piece.

        b. If two or more parties both want the same pieces and no others, then give a
             non-contested piece to the divider. The rest of the pieces are combined
             and repeat the entire procedure with the remaining parties. If there are
             only two parties left, they can use divider-chooser.

Example 5
     Consider the example from earlier, in which the pieces were valued as:

Chooser 1  Piece 1  Piece 2  Piece 3
Chooser 2  40%      30%      30%
Divider    45%      30%      25%
           33.3%    33.3%    33.3%

Each chooser makes a declaration of which pieces they value as a fair share. In this case,

Chooser 1 would make the declaration: Piece 1
Chooser 2 would make the declaration: Piece 1

Since both choosers want the same piece, we cannot immediately allocate the pieces. The
lone divider method specifies that we give a non-contested piece to the divider. Both pieces
2 and 3 are uncontested, so we flip a coin and give Piece 2 to the divider. Piece 1 and 3 are
then recombined to make a piece worth 70% to Chooser 1, and 70% to Chooser 2. Since
there are only two players left, they can divide the recombined pieces using divider-chooser.
Each is guaranteed a piece they value as at least 35%, which is a fair share.

Example 6
     Suppose that Abby, Brian, Chris, and Dorian are dividing a plot of land. Dorian was selected
     to be the divider through a coin toss. Each person's valuation of each piece is shown below.

    Abby    Piece 1         Piece 2           Piece 3      Piece 4
    Brian   15%             30%               20%          35%
    Chris   30%             35%               10%          25%
    Dorian  20%             45%               20%          15%
            25%             25%               25%          25%

Based on this, their declarations should be:
Abby: Piece 2, Piece 4
Brian: Piece 1, Piece 2, Piece 4
Chris: Piece 2

This case can be settled simply - by awarding Piece 2 to Chris, Piece 4 to Abby, Piece 1 to
Brian, and Piece 3 to Dorian. Each person receives a piece that they value as at least a fair
share (25% value).

Example 7
     Suppose the valuations in the previous problem were:

    Abby    Piece 1         Piece 2           Piece 3      Piece 4
    Brian   15%             30%               20%          35%
    Chris   20%             35%               10%          35%
    Dorian  20%             45%               20%          15%
            25%             25%               25%          25%

The declarations would be:
Abby: Piece 2, Piece 4
Brian: Piece 2, Piece 4
Chris: Piece 2

Notice in this case that there is no simple settlement. So, the piece no one else declared,
Piece 3, is awarded to the original divider Dorian, and the procedure is repeated with the
remaining three players.

Suppose that on the second round of this method Brian is selected to be the divider, three
new pieces are cut, and the valuations are as follows:

    Abby    Piece 1         Piece 2           Piece 3
    Brian   40%             30%               30%
    Chris   33.3%           33.3%             33.3%
            50%             20%               30%
                                                                                       Fair Division 99

The declarations here would be:
Abby: Piece 1
Chris: Piece 1

Once again we have a standoff. Brian can be awarded either of Piece 2 or Piece 3, and the
remaining pieces can be recombined. Since there are only two players left, they can divide
the remaining land using the basic divider-chooser method.

Last Diminisher
   The Last Diminisher method is another approach to division among 3 or more parties.

       Last Diminisher Method
       In this method, the parties are randomly assigned an order, perhaps by pulling names
       out of a hat. The method then proceeds as follows:

             1) The first person cuts a slice they value as a fair share.
             2) The second person examines the piece

                      a. If they think it is worth less than a fair share, they then pass on the
                           piece unchanged.

                      b. If they think the piece is worth more than a fair share, they trim off
                           the excess and lay claim to the piece. The trimmings are added back
                           into the to-be-divided pile.

             3) Each remaining person, in turn, can either pass or trim the piece
             4) After the last person has made their decision, the last person to trim the slice

                  receives it. If no one has modified the slice, then the person who cut it
                  receives it.
             5) Whoever receives the piece leaves with their piece and the process repeats
                  with the remaining people. Continue until only 2 people remain; they can
                  divide what is left with the divider-chooser method.

Example 8
     Suppose that four salespeople are dividing up Washington State into sales regions; each will
     get one region to work in. They pull names from a hat to decide play order.

     Round 1. The first salesman, Bob, draws a region around
     Seattle, the most populous area of the state. The piece Bob
     cuts and automatically lays claim to is shown in yellow.

     The second salesman, Henry, felt that this region was worth
     more than 25%, each player's fair share. Because of this,
     Henry opts to trim this piece. The new piece is shown in pink.
     The trimmings (in yellow) return to the to-be-divided portion
     of the state. Henry automatically lays claim to this smaller
     piece since he trimmed it.

     The third saleswoman, Marjo, feels this piece is worth less
     than 25% and passes, as does the fourth saleswoman, Beth.
     Since both pass, the last person to trim it, Henry, receives the
     piece.

     Round 2. The second round begins with Bob laying claim to a
     piece, shown again in yellow. Henry already has a piece, so is
     out of the process now. Marjo passes on this piece, feeling it is
     worth less than a fair share.

     Beth, on the other hand, feels the piece as currently drawn is
     worth 35%. Beth is in an advantageous position, being the
     last to make a decision. Even though Beth values this piece at
     35%, she can cut a very small amount and still lay claim to it.
     So Beth barely cuts the piece, resulting in a piece (blue) that is
     essentially worth 35% to her. Since she is the last to trim, she
     receives the piece.

     Round 3. At this point, Bob and Marjo are the only players
     without a piece. Since there are two of them, they can finish
     the division using the divider-chooser method. They flip a
     coin, and determine that Marjo will be the divider. Marjo
     draws a line dividing the remainder of the state into two pieces.
     Bob chooses the Eastern piece, leaving Marjo with the Western
     half.

     Notice that in this division, Henry and Marjo ended up with pieces that they feel are worth
     exactly 25% - a fair share. Beth was able to receive a piece she values as more than a fair
     share, and Bob may feel the piece he received is worth more than 25%.

Example 9
     Marcus, Abby, Julian, and Ben are splitting a pizza that is 4 slices of cheese and 4 slices of
     veggie with total value $12. Marcus and Ben like both flavors equally, Abby only likes
     cheese, and Julian likes veggie twice as much as cheese. They divide the pizza using last
     diminisher method, playing in the order Marcus, Abby, Ben, then Julian.

     Notice Ben and Marcus both value any slice of pizza at $1.50.
     Abby values each slice of cheese at $3, and veggie at $0.
     Julian values each slice of cheese at $1, and each slice of veggie at $2. (see Example 2)
     A fair share for any player is $3.

     In the first round, suppose Marcus cuts out 2 slices of cheese, which he values at $3.
     Abby only likes cheese, so will value this cut at $6. She will trim it to 1 slice of cheese,
     which she values as her fair share of $3.
     Ben will view this piece as less than a fair share, and will pass.
     Julian will view this piece as less than a fair share, and will pass.
     Abby receives the piece.

     In the second round, suppose Marcus cuts a slice that is 2 slices of veggie.
     Abby already received a slice so is out.
     Ben will view this piece as having value $3. He can barely trim it and lay claim to it.
     Julian will value this piece as having value $4, so will barely trim it and claim it.

     Marcus and Ben can then split the remaining 3 slices of cheese and 2 slices of veggie using
     the divider-chooser method.

     In the second round, both Ben and Julian will make tiny trims (pulling off a small crumb) in
     order to lay claim to the piece without practically reducing the value. The piece Julian
     receives is still essentially worth $4 to him; we don't worry about the value of that crumb.

 Moving Knife
     A somewhat different approach to continuous fair division is called the moving knife
     procedure.

         Moving Knife Method
         In this method, applied to a cake,

               1) A referee starts moving a knife from left to right across a cake.
               2) As soon as any player feels the piece to the left of the knife is worth a fair

                   share, they shout "STOP." The referee then cuts the cake at the current knife
                   position and the player who called stop gets the piece to the left of the knife.
               3) This procedure continues until there is only one player left. The player left
                   gets the remaining cake.

Example 10
     Suppose that our four salespeople from above decided to use this approach to divide
     Washington. Rather than move the "knife" from left to
     right, they decide to move it from top to bottom.

     The referee starts moving a line down a map of the state.
     Henry is the first to call STOP when the knife is at the
     position shown, giving him the portion of the state
     above the line.

     Marjo is the next to call STOP when the knife is at the
     position shown, giving her the second portion of the
     state.

     Bob is the next to call STOP, leaving Beth with the
     southernmost portion of the state

     While this method guarantees a fair division, it clearly results in some potentially silly
     divisions in a case like this. The method is probably better suited to situations like dividing
     an actual cake.

Sealed Bids Method
   The Sealed Bids method provides a method for discrete fair division, allowing for the
   division of items that cannot be split into smaller pieces, like a house or a car. Because of
   this, the method requires that all parties have a large amount of cash at their disposal to
   balance out the difference in item values.

Sealed Bids Method
The method begins by compiling a list of items to be divided. Then:

      1) Each party involved lists, in secret, a dollar amount they value each item to
          be worth. This is their sealed bid.

      2) The bids are collected. For each party, the value of all the items is totaled,
          and divided by the number of parties. This defines their fair share.

      3) Each item is awarded to the highest bidder.
      4) For each party, the value of all items received is totaled. If the value is more

          than that party's fair share, they pay the difference into a holding pile. If the
          value is less than that party's fair share, they receive the difference from the
          holding pile. This ends the initial allocation.
      5) In most cases, there will be a surplus, or leftover money, in the holding pile.
          The surplus is divided evenly between all the players. This produces the
          final allocation.

While the assumptions we made for fair division methods specified that an arbitrator should
not be necessary, it is common for an independent third party to collect the bids and
announce the outcome. While not technically necessary, since the method can be executed
without a third party involved, this protects the secrecy of the bids, which can sometimes
help avoid resentment or bad feelings between the players.

Example 11
     Sam and Omar have cohabitated for the last 3 years, during which time they shared the
     expense of purchasing several items for their home. Sam has accepted a job in another city,
     and now they find themselves needing to divide their shared assets.

     Each records their value of each item, as shown below.

Couch                  Sam Omar
TV                     $150 $100
Video game system      $200 $250
Surround sound system  $250 $150
                       $50 $100

Sam's total valuation of the items is $150+$200+$250+$50 = $650, making a fair share for
Sam $650/2 = $325.
104

Omar's total valuation of the items is $100+$250+$150+$100 = $600, making a fair share for
Omar $600/2 = $300.

Each item is now awarded to the highest bidder. Sam will receive the couch and video game
system, providing $150+$250 = $400 of value to Sam. Since this exceeds his fair share, he
has to pay the difference, $75, into a holding pile.

Omar will receive the TV and surround sound system, providing $250+$100=$350 in value.
This is more than his fair share, so he has to pay the difference, $50, into the holding pile.

Thus, in the initial allocation, Sam receives the couch and video game system and pays $75
into the holding pile. Omar receives the TV and surround sound system and pays $50 into
the holding pile. At this point, both players would feel they have received a fair share.

There is now $125 remaining in the holding pile. This is the surplus from the division. This
is now split evenly, and both Sam and Omar are given back $62.50. Since Sam had paid in
$75, the net effect is that he paid $12.50. Since Omar had originally paid in $50, the net
effect is that he receives $12.50.

Thus, in the final allocation, Sam receives the couch and video game system and pays $12.50
to Omar. Omar receives the TV and surround sound system and receives $12.50. At this
point, both players feel they have received more than a fair share.

Example 12

     Four small graphic design companies are merging operations to become one larger
     corporation. In this merger, there are a number of issues that need to be settled. Each
     company is asked to place a monetary value (in thousands of dollars) on each issue:

Company name        Super Designs        DesignByMe  LayoutPros  Graphix
Company location    $5                   $3          $3          $6
CEO                 $8                   $9          $7          $6
Chair of the board  $10                  $5          $6          $7
                    $7                   $6          $6          $8

We can then calculate for each company:

                    Super Designs        DesignByMe  LayoutPros  Graphix
                                         $23         $22         $27
Total value of all $30
                                         $5.75       $5.50       $6.75
issues

Fair share          $7.50

The items would then be allocated to the company that bid the most for each.
Company name would be awarded to Graphix
Company location would be awarded to DesignByMe
CEO would be awarded to Super Designs
Chair of the board would be awarded to Graphix
                                                                Fair Division 105

For each company, we calculate the total value of the items they receive, and how much they

get or pay in the initial allocation

                Super Designs DesignByMe LayoutPros Graphix

Total value of  $10                          $9      $0         $14

issues awarded

Amount they     $7.50-$10                    $5.75 - $9 $5.50 - $0 $6.75 - $14

pay/get         Pay $2.50                    Pay $3.25 Get $5.50 Pay $7.25

After the initial allocation, there is a total of $2.50+$3.25-$5.50+$7.25 = $7.50 in surplus.

Dividing that evenly, each company gets $1.875 (approximately)

                Super Designs DesignByMe LayoutPros Graphix

Amount they     Pay $2.50                    Pay $3.25 Get $5.50 Pay $7.25

pay/get         Get $1.875                   Get $1.875 Get $1.875 Get $1.875

After surplus   Pay $0.625                   Pay $1.375 Get $7.375 Pay $5.375

So in the final allocation,
Super Designs wins the CEO, and pays $625 ($0.625 thousand)
DesignByMe wins the company location and pays $1,375 ($1.375 thousand)
LayoutPros wins no issues, but receives $7,375 in compensation
Graphix wins the company name and chair of the board, and pays $5,375.

Example 13

     Fair division does not always have to be used for items of value. It can also be used to divide
     undesirable items. Suppose Chelsea and Mariah are sharing an apartment, and need to split
     the chores for the household. They list the chores, assigning a negative dollar value to each
     item; in other words, the amount they would pay for someone else to do the chore (a per
     week amount). We will assume, however, that they are committed to doing all the chores
     themselves and not hiring a maid.
106

     Vacuuming                     Chelsea  Mariah
     Cleaning bathroom             -$10     -$8
     Doing dishes                  -$14     -$20
     Dusting                       -$4      -$6
                                   -$6      -$4

We can then calculate fair share:  Chelsea  Mariah
                                   -$34     -$38
      Total value                  -$17     -$19
      Fair Share

We award to the person with the largest bid. For example, we award vacuuming to Mariah
since she dislikes it less (remember -8 > -10).
Chelsea gets cleaning the bathroom and doing dishes. Value: -$18
Mariah gets vacuuming and dusting. Value: -$12

Notice that Chelsea's fair share is -$17 but she is doing chores she values at -$18. She
should get $1 to bring her to a fair share. Mariah is doing chores valued at -$12, but her fair
share is -$19. She needs to pay $7 to bring her to a fair share.

This creates a surplus of $6, which will be divided between the two. In the final allocation:
Chelsea gets cleaning the bathroom and doing dishes, and receives $1 + $3 = $4/week.
Mariah gets vacuuming and dusting, and pays $7 - $3 = $4/week.

1. Kim will value the veggie half of the pizza at the full value, $12, and the pepperoni half as
worth $0. Since a fair share is 25%, a fair share for Kim is one slice of veggie, which she'll
value at $3. Of course, Kim only getting one slice doesn't really seem very fair, but if every
player had the same valuation as Kim, this would be the only fair outcome. Luckily, if the
classmates splitting the pizza are friends, they are probably cooperative, and will talk about
what kind of pizza they like.

2. There are a lot of possible fair divisions Quinn could make. Since she values the two
desserts at $14 together, a fair share in her eyes is $7. Notice since Dustin values the desserts
at $10 together, a fair share in his eyes is $5 of value. A couple possible divisions:

Piece 1              Piece 2                Dustin would choose
7/10 chocolate ($7)  3/10 chocolate ($3)    Piece 2. Value in his eyes:
No pie ($0)          All pie ($4)           $6 + 3/10·$4 = $7.20
½ chocolate ($5)     ½ chocolate ($5)       Either. Value in his eyes:
½ pie ($2)           ½ pie ($2)             ½ ·$6 + ½ ·$4 = $5

3. Chooser 1 would make the declaration: Piece 1
Chooser 2 would make the declaration: Piece 1, Piece 2
We can immediately allocate the pieces, giving Piece 2 to Chooser 2, Piece 1 to Chooser 1,
and Piece 3 to the Divider. All players receive a piece they value as a fair share.
                                                                                      Fair Division 107

4. A fair share would be $80,000. Cesar was the divider.
Their declarations would be:
Sonya: Pierce 1, Piece 3, Piece 4.
Adrianna: Piece 3, Piece 4
Raquel: Piece 3, Piece 4

Sonya would receive Piece 1 and Cesar would receive the uncontested Piece 2.
Since Adrianna and Raquel both want Piece 3 or Piece 4, a coin would be flipped to allocate
those pieces between them.

5. In the first round, Player 1 will cut a piece he values as a fair share of $4. Player 2 values
the piece as $3, so will pass. Player 3 values the piece as $5, so will claim it and trim it to
something she values as $4. Player 4 receives that piece and values it as $3.50 so will pass.
Player 5 values the piece at $3 and will also pass. Player 3 receives the trimmed piece she
values at $4.

In the second round, Player 1 will again cut a piece he values as a fair share of $4. Player 2
values the piece as $7, so will claim it and trim it to something he values as $4. Player 4
values the trimmed piece at $3 and passes. Player 5 values the piece at $5, so will claim it.
Since Player 5 is the last player, she has an advantage and can claim then barely trim the
piece. Player 5 receives a piece she values at $5.

6. Jamal's total value is $250 + $170 + $300 = $720. His fair share is $240 thousand.
Maggie's total value is $300 + $180 + $255 = $735. Her fair share is $245 thousand.
Kendra's total value is$280 + $200 + $270 = $750. Her fair share is $250 thousand.

In the initial allocation,
Jamal receives the business, and pays $300 - $240 = $60 thousand into holding.
Maggie receives the house, and pays $300 - $245 = $55 thousand into holding.
Kendra receives the vacation home, and gets $250 - $200 = $50 thousand from holding.

There is a surplus of $60 + $55 - $50 = $65 thousand in holding, so each person will receive
$21,667 from surplus. In the final allocation,
Jamal receives the business, and pays $38,333.
Maggie receives the house, and pays $33,333.
Kendra receives the vacation home, and gets $71,667.

     b. Assume Brianna and Carlos bid honestly, but Greedy decides to bid only for s1,

         figuring that doing so will get him s1. In this case there is a standoff between
         Brianna and Greedy. Since Danny and Carlos are not part of the standoff, they can
         receive their fair shares. Suppose Danny gets s3 and Carlos gets s2, and the
         remaining pieces are put back together and Brianna and Greedy will split them
         using the basic divider-chooser method. If Greedy gets selected to be the divider,
         what will be the value of the piece he receives?
     c. Extension: Create a Sealed Bids scenario that shows that sometimes a player can
         successfully cheat and increase the value they receive by increasing their bid on
         an item, but if they increase it too much, they could end up receiving less than
         their fair share.

18. Explain why divider-chooser method with two players will always result in an envy-
    free division.

19. Will the lone divider method always result in an envy-free division? If not, will it
    ever result in an envy-free division?

20. The Selfridge-Conway method is an envy-free division method for three players.
    Research how the method works and prepare a demonstration for the class.

21. Suppose that two people are dividing a $12 pizza that is half pepperoni, half cheese.
    Steve likes both equally, but Maria likes cheese twice as much as pepperoni. As
    divider, Steve divides the pizza so that one piece is 1/3 cheese and 2/3 pepperoni, and
    the second piece is 1/3 pepperoni and 2/3 cheese.
         a. Describe the value of each piece to each player
         b. Since the value to each player is not the same, this division is not equitable.
             Find a division that would be equitable. Is it still envy-free?
         c. The original division is not Pareto optimal. To show this, find another
             division that would increase the value to one player without decreasing the
             value to the other player. Is this division still envy-free?
         d. Would it be possible with this set of preferences to find a division that is both
             equitable and Pareto optimal? If so, find it. If not, explain why.

22. Is the Sealed Bids method Pareto optimal when used with two players? If not, can
    you adjust the method to be so?

23. Is the Sealed Bids method envy-free when used with two players? If not, can you
    adjust the method to be so?

24. Is the Sealed Bids method equitable when used with two players? If not, can you
    adjust the method to be so?

25. All the problems we have looked at in this chapter have assumed that all participants
    receive an equal share of what is being divided. Often, this does not occur in real life.
    Suppose Fred and Maria are going to divide a cake using the divider-chooser method.
    However, Fred is only entitled to 30% of the cake, and Maria is entitled to 70% of the
    cake (maybe it was a $10 cake, and Fred put in $3 and Maria put in $7). Adapt the
    divider-choose method to allow them to divide the cake fairly.

    Assume (as we have throughout this chapter) that different parts of the cake may have
    different values to Fred and Maria, and that they don't communicate their
    preferences/values with each other. You goal is to come up with a method of fair
    division, meaning that although the participants may not receive equal shares, they
    should be guaranteed their fair share. Your method needs to be designed so that each
    person will always be guaranteed a share that they value as being worth at least as
    much as they're entitled to.
114

The last few questions will be based on the Adjusted Winner method, described here:
For discrete division between two players, there is a method called Adjusted Winner that
produces an outcome that is always equitable, envy-free, and Pareto optimal. It does,
however, require that items can be split or shared. The method works like this:

1) Each player gets 100 points that they assign to the items to be divided based on their
    relative worth.

2) In the initial allocation, each item is given to the party that assigned it more points. If
    there were any items with both parties assigned the same number of points, they'd go to
    the person with the fewest points so far.

3) If the assigned point values are not equal, then begin transferring items from the person
    with more points to the person with fewer points. Start with the items that have the
    smallest point ratio, calculated as (higher valuation/lower valuation).

4) If transferring an entire item would move too many points, only transfer a portion of the
    item.

Example: A couple is attempting to settle a contentious divorce1. They assign their 100
points to the issues in contention:

Custody of children        Mike  Carol
Alimony                    25    65
House                      60    25
                           15    10

In the initial allocation, Mike gets his way on alimony and house, and Carol gets custody of
the children. In the initial allocation, Mike has 75 points and Carol has 65 points. To decide
what to transfer, we calculate the point ratios.

Custody of children  Mike  Carol                   Point ratio
Alimony              25    65                      65/25 = 2.6
House                60    25                      60/25 = 2.4
                     15    10                      15/10 = 1.5

Since the house has the smallest point ratio, the house will be the item we work with first.
Since transferring the entire house would give Carol too many points, we instead need to
transfer some fraction, p, of the house to that Carol and Mike will end up with the same point
values. If Carol receives a fraction p of the house, then Mike will give up (1-p) of the house.
The value Carol will receive is 10p: the fraction p of the 10 points Carol values the house at.
The value Mike will get is 15(1-p). We set their point totals equal to solve for p:

65 + 10p = 60 + 15(1-p)
65 + 10p = 60 + 15 - 15p
25p= 10
p = 10/25 = 0.4 = 40%. So Carol should receive 40% of the house.

Graph Theory and Network Flows

     In the modern world, planning efficient routes is essential for business and industry, with
     applications as varied as product distribution, laying new fiber optic lines for broadband
     internet, and suggesting new friends within social network websites like Facebook.

     This field of mathematics started nearly 300 years ago as a look into a mathematical puzzle
     (we'll look at it in a bit). The field has exploded in importance in the last century, both
     because of the growing complexity of business in a global economy and because of the
     computational power that computers have provided us.

Example 1
     Here is a portion of a housing development from Missoula, Montana1. As part of her job, the
     development's lawn inspector has to walk down every street in the development making sure
     homeowners' landscaping conforms to the community requirements.

Naturally, she wants to minimize the amount of walking she has to do. Is it possible for her
to walk down every street in this development without having to do any backtracking?
While you might be able to answer that question just by looking at the picture for a while, it
would be ideal to be able to answer the question for any picture regardless of its complexity.

To do that, we first need to simplify the picture into a form that is easier to work with. We
can do that by drawing a simple line for each street. Where streets intersect, we will place a
dot.

                                          A                       B                                 C

This type of simplified picture is called a graph.

Graphs, Vertices, and Edges
A graph consists of a set of dots, called vertices, and a set of edges connecting pairs of
vertices.

While we drew our original graph to correspond with the picture we had, there is nothing

particularly important about the layout when we analyze a graph. Both of the graphs below

are equivalent to the one drawn above since they show the same edge connections between

the same vertices as the original graph.

You probably already noticed that we are using the term graph differently than you may have
used the term in the past to describe the graph of a mathematical function.

Example 2
     Back in the 18th century in the Prussian city of
     Königsberg, a river ran through the city and seven
     bridges crossed the forks of the river. The river
     and the bridges are highlighted in the picture to
     the right2.

     As a weekend amusement, townsfolk would see if
     they could find a route that would take them
     across every bridge once and return them to
     where they started.

     Leonard Euler (pronounced OY-lur), one of the
     most prolific mathematicians ever, looked at this problem in 1735, laying the foundation for
     graph theory as a field in mathematics. To analyze this problem, Euler introduced edges
     representing the bridges:

        North Bank

Island              East Bank

                        South Bank

Since the size of each land mass it is not relevant to the question of bridge crossings, each
can be shrunk down to a vertex representing the location:

                NB

                                   EB
                 I

                SB

Notice that in this graph there are two edges connecting the north bank and island,
corresponding to the two bridges in the original drawing. Depending upon the interpretation
of edges and vertices appropriate to a scenario, it is entirely possible and reasonable to have
more than one edge connecting two vertices.

While we haven't answered the actual question yet of whether or not there is a route which
crosses every bridge once and returns to the starting location, the graph provides the
foundation for exploring this question.

Definitions
While we loosely defined some terminology earlier, we now will try to be more specific.

   Vertex
   A vertex is a dot in the graph that could represent an intersection of streets, a land
   mass, or a general location, like "work" or "school". Vertices are often connected by
   edges. Note that vertices only occur when a dot is explicitly placed, not whenever two
   edges cross. Imagine a freeway overpass - the freeway and side street cross, but it is
   not possible to change from the side street to the freeway at that point, so there is no
   intersection and no vertex would be placed.

   Edges
   Edges connect pairs of vertices. An edge can represent a physical connection between
   locations, like a street, or simply that a route connecting the two locations exists, like
   an airline flight.

   Loop
   A loop is a special type of edge that connects a vertex to itself. Loops are not used
   much in street network graphs.

Degree of a vertex
The degree of a vertex is the number of edges meeting at that vertex. It is possible for
a vertex to have a degree of zero or larger.

Degree 0  Degree 1  Degree2  Degree 3  Degree 4

Path
A path is a sequence of vertices using the edges. Usually we are interested in a path
between two vertices. For example, a path from vertex A to vertex M is shown below.
It is one of many possible paths in this graph.

A         B  C      D

E         F  G      H

J         K  L      M
                                                    Graph Theory 121

Circuit
A circuit is a path that begins and ends at the same vertex. A circuit starting and
ending at vertex A is shown below.

A  B                        C               D

E  F                        G               H

J  K                        L               M

Connected
A graph is connected if there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex. Every
graph drawn so far has been connected. The graph below is disconnected; there is no
way to get from the vertices on the left to the vertices on the right.

Weights
Depending upon the problem being solved, sometimes weights are assigned to the
edges. The weights could represent the distance between two locations, the travel time,
or the travel cost. It is important to note that the distance between vertices in a graph
does not necessarily correspond to the weight of an edge.

Try it Now 1

      one-way flight between the cities.

      b. Is the graph connected?
      c. What is the degree of the vertex representing LA?

      e. If you fly from LA to Chicago to Dallas to LA, is that a path or a circuit?

Shortest Path
   When you visit a website like Google Maps or use your Smartphone to ask for directions
   from home to your Aunt's house in Pasadena, you are usually looking for a shortest path
   between the two locations. These computer applications use representations of the street
   maps as graphs, with estimated driving times as edge weights.

   While often it is possible to find a shortest path on a small graph by guess-and-check, our
   goal in this chapter is to develop methods to solve complex problems in a systematic way by
   following algorithms. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.
   Dijkstra's (pronounced dike-stra) algorithm will find the shortest path between two vertices.

Dijkstra's Algorithm
1. Mark the ending vertex with a distance of zero. Designate this vertex as current.
2. Find all vertices leading to the current vertex. Calculate their distances to the end.

    Since we already know the distance the current vertex is from the end, this will just
    require adding the most recent edge. Don't record this distance if it is longer than a
    previously recorded distance.
3. Mark the current vertex as visited. We will never look at this vertex again.
4. Mark the vertex with the smallest distance as current, and repeat from step 2.

Example 3

     Suppose you need to travel from Tacoma, WA (vertex T) to Yakima, WA (vertex Y).
     Looking at a map, it looks like driving through Auburn (A) then Mount Rainier (MR) might
     be shortest, but it's not totally clear since that road is probably slower than taking the major
     highway through North Bend (NB). A graph with travel times in minutes is shown below.
     An alternate route through Eatonville (E) and Packwood (P) is also shown.

Step 2: For each vertex leading to    T 20               NB [104]         Y [0]
Y, we calculate the distance to the      57
end. For example, NB is a                    A 36 104
distance of 104 from the end, and                     79 MR [96]
MR is 96 from the end.                                                96
Remember that distances in this                         27
case refer to the travel time in                                     76
minutes.
                                             E 96 P [76]

Step 3 & 4: We mark Y as visited, and mark the vertex with the smallest recorded distance
as current. At this point, P will be designated current. Back to step 2.

Step 2 (#2): For each vertex leading  to P (and not leading to a visited vertex) we find the
distance from the end. Since E is 96  minutes from P, and we've already calculated P is 76
minutes from Y, we can compute
that E is 96+76 = 172 minutes                         NB [104]
from Y.
                                      T 20   A 36 104
If we make the same computation                      79 MR [96]
for MR, we'd calculate 76+27 =                                        96  Y [0]
103. Since this is larger than the
previously recorded distance from                      27
Y to MR, we will not replace it.
                                      57                           76
                                          E [172] 96      P [76]

Step 3 & 4 (#2): We mark P as visited, and designate the vertex with the smallest recorded
distance as current: MR. Back to step 2.

Step 2 (#3): For each vertex                          NB [104]
leading to MR (and not leading to
a visited vertex) we find the         A [175] 36                104
distance to the end. The only
vertex to be considered is A, since   T 20        79 MR [96]
we've already visited Y and P.                                    96
Adding MR's distance 96 to the                                            Y [0]
length from A to MR gives the                         27
distance 96+79 = 175 minutes
from A to Y.                          57                           76

Step 3 & 4 (#3): We mark MR as visited, and designate the vertex with smallest recorded
distance as current: NB. Back to step 2.
124

Step 2 (#4): For each vertex                         NB [104]
leading to NB, we find the
distance to the end. We know the     A [140] 36                                      104
shortest distance from NB to Y is
104 and the distance from A to       T 20        79 MR [96]
NB is 36, so the distance from A                                 96
to Y through NB is 104+36 = 140.                                                          Y [0]
Since this distance is shorter than                  27
the previously calculated distance
from Y to A through MR, we           57                           76
replace it.                              E [172] 96      P [76]

Step 3 & 4 (#4): We mark NB as visited, and designate A as current, since it now has the
shortest distance.

                                                     NB [104]

Step 2 (#5): T is the only           A [140] 36                                      104
non-visited vertex leading to
A, so we calculate the         T [160] 20        79 MR [96]
distance from T to Y through                                     96
A: 20+140 = 160 minutes.                                                                  Y [0]

                                     57                           76
                                         E [172] 96      P [76]

Step 3 & 4 (#5): We mark A as visited, and designate E as current.

Step 2 (#6): The only non-visited vertex leading to E is T. Calculating the distance from T
to Y through E, we compute 172+57 = 229 minutes. Since this is longer than the existing
marked time, we do not replace it.

Step 3 (#6): We mark E as visited. Since all vertices have been visited, we are done.

From this, we know that the shortest path from Tacoma to Yakima will take 160 minutes.
Tracking which sequence of edges yielded 160 minutes, we see the shortest path is T-A-NB-
Y.

Dijkstra's algorithm is an optimal algorithm, meaning that it always produces the actual
shortest path, not just a path that is pretty short, provided one exists. This algorithm is also
efficient, meaning that it can be implemented in a reasonable amount of time. Dijkstra's
algorithm takes around V2 calculations, where V is the number of vertices in a graph3. A
graph with 100 vertices would take around 10,000 calculations. While that would be a lot to
do by hand, it is not a lot for computer to handle. It is because of this efficiency that your
car's GPS unit can compute driving directions in only a few seconds.

3 It can be made to run faster through various optimizations to the implementation.
                                                                                     Graph Theory 125

In contrast, an inefficient algorithm might try to list all possible paths then compute the
length of each path. Trying to list all possible paths could easily take 1025 calculations to
compute the shortest path with only 25 vertices; that's a 1 with 25 zeros after it! To put that
in perspective, the fastest computer in the world would still spend over 1000 years analyzing
all those paths.

Example 4
     A shipping company needs to route a package from Washington, D.C. to San Diego, CA. To
     minimize costs, the package will first be sent to their processing center in Baltimore, MD
     then sent as part of mass shipments between their various processing centers, ending up in
     their processing center in Bakersfield, CA. From there it will be delivered in a small truck to
     San Diego.

     The travel times, in hours, between their processing centers are shown in the table below.
     Three hours has been added to each travel time for processing. Find the shortest path from
     Baltimore to Bakersfield.

             Baltimore Denver Dallas Chicago Atlanta Bakersfield

Baltimore *                            15  14

Denver                  *              18  24           19

Dallas                      *          18  15           25

Bakersfield             19  25                          *

While we could draw a graph, we can also work directly from the table.

Step 1: The ending vertex, Bakersfield, is marked as current.

Step 2: All cities connected to Bakersfield, in this case Denver and Dallas, have their
distances calculated; we'll mark those distances in the column headers.

Step 3 & 4: Mark Bakersfield as visited. Here, we are doing it by shading the corresponding
row and column of the table. We mark Denver as current, shown in bold, since it is the
vertex with the shortest distance.

             Baltimore  Denver Dallas  Chicago Atlanta  Bakersfield

126

Step 2 (#2): For cities connected to Denver, calculate distance to the end. For example,
Chicago is 18 hours from Denver, and Denver is 19 hours from the end, the distance for
Chicago to the end is 18+19 = 37 (Chicago to Denver to Bakersfield). Atlanta is 24 hours
from Denver, so the distance to the end is 24+19 = 43 (Atlanta to Denver to Bakersfield).

Step 3 & 4 (#2): We mark Denver as visited and mark Dallas as current.

     Baltimore    Baltimore  Denver  Dallas  Chicago  Atlanta           Bakersfield
     Denver       *          [19]    [25]    [37]     [43]              [0]
     Dallas                                  15       14
     Chicago      15         *       *       18       24                19
     Atlanta      14                 18      18       15                25
     Bakersfield             18      15      *        14
                             24      25      14       *                 *
                             19

Step 2 (#3): For cities connected to Dallas, calculate the distance to the end. For Chicago,
the distance from Chicago to Dallas is 18 and from Dallas to the end is 25, so the distance
from Chicago to the end through Dallas would be 18+25 = 43. Since this is longer than the
currently marked distance for Chicago, we do not replace it. For Atlanta, we calculate 15+25
= 40. Since this is shorter than the currently marked distance for Atlanta, we replace the
existing distance.

Step 3 & 4 (#3): We mark Dallas as visited, and mark Chicago as current.

     Baltimore    Baltimore  Denver  Dallas  Chicago  Atlanta             Bakersfield
     Denver       *          [19]    [25]    [37]     [40]                [0]
     Dallas                                  15       14
     Chicago      15         *       *       18       24                  19
     Atlanta      14                 18      18       15                  25
     Bakersfield             18      15      *        14
                             24      25      14       *                   *
                             19

Step 2 (#4): Baltimore and Atlanta are the only non-visited cities connected to Chicago. For
Baltimore, we calculate 15+37 = 52 and mark that distance. For Atlanta, we calculate 14+37
= 51. Since this is longer than the existing distance of 40 for Atlanta, we do not replace that
distance.

Step 3 & 4 (#4): Mark Chicago as visited and Atlanta as current.

Baltimore     Baltimore     Denver  Dallas  Chicago  Atlanta         Bakersfield
Denver        [52]          [19]    [25]    [37]     [40]            [0]
Dallas        *                             15       14
Chicago                     *       *       18       24              19
Atlanta       15                    18      18       15              25
Bakersfield   14            18      15      *        14
                            24      25      14       *               *
                            19

Step 2 (#5): The distance from Atlanta to Baltimore is 14. Adding that to the distance
already calculated for Atlanta gives a total distance of 14+40 = 54 hours from Baltimore to
Bakersfield through Atlanta. Since this is larger than the currently calculated distance, we do
not replace the distance for Baltimore.

Step 3 & 4 (#5): We mark Atlanta as visited. All cities have been visited and we are done.

The shortest route from Baltimore to Bakersfield will take 52 hours, and will route through
Chicago and Denver.

Euler Circuits and the Chinese Postman Problem
   In the first section, we created a graph of the Königsberg bridges and asked whether it was
   possible to walk across every bridge once. Because Euler first studied this question, these
   types of paths are named after him.

       Euler Path
       An Euler path is a path that uses every edge in a graph with no repeats. Being a path,
       it does not have to return to the starting vertex.
128

Example 5
     In the graph shown below, there are several Euler paths. One such path is CABDCB. The
     path is shown in arrows to the right, with the order of edges numbered.

     B        C

Euler Circuit
An Euler circuit is a circuit that uses every edge in a graph with no repeats. Being a
circuit, it must start and end at the same vertex.

Example 6
     The graph below has several possible Euler circuits. Here's a couple, starting and ending at
     vertex A: ADEACEFCBA and AECABCFEDA. The second is shown in arrows.

Look back at the example used for Euler paths - does that graph have an Euler circuit? A
few tries will tell you no; that graph does not have an Euler circuit. When we were working
with shortest paths, we were interested in the optimal path. With Euler paths and circuits,
we're primarily interested in whether an Euler path or circuit exists.

Why do we care if an Euler circuit exists? Think back to our housing development lawn
inspector from the beginning of the chapter. The lawn inspector is interested in walking as
little as possible. The ideal situation would be a circuit that covers every street with no
repeats. That's an Euler circuit! Luckily, Euler solved the question of whether or not an
Euler path or circuit will exist.

   Euler's Path and Circuit Theorems
   A graph will contain an Euler path if it contains at most two vertices of odd degree.

   A graph will contain an Euler circuit if all vertices have even degree
                                                                                          Graph Theory 129

Example 7
     In the graph below, vertices A and C have degree 4, since there are 4 edges leading into each
     vertex. B is degree 2, D is degree 3, and E is degree 1. This graph contains two vertices with
     odd degree (D and E) and three vertices with even degree (A, B, and C), so Euler's theorems
     tell us this graph has an Euler path, but not an Euler circuit.

               B
                                   C

Example 8
     Is there an Euler circuit on the housing development lawn inspector graph we created earlier
     in the chapter? All the highlighted vertices have odd degree. Since there are more than two
     vertices with odd degree, there are no Euler paths or Euler circuits on this graph.
     Unfortunately our lawn inspector will need to do some backtracking.

Example 9
     When it snows in the same housing development, the snowplow has to plow both sides of
     every street. For simplicity, we'll assume the plow is out early enough that it can ignore
     traffic laws and drive down either side of the street in either direction. This can be visualized
     in the graph by drawing two edges for each street, representing the two sides of the street.

     Notice that every vertex in this graph has even degree, so this graph does have an Euler
     circuit.
130

Now we know how to determine if a graph has an Euler circuit, but if it does, how do we find
one? While it usually is possible to find an Euler circuit just by pulling out your pencil and
trying to find one, the more formal method is Fleury's algorithm.

Fleury's Algorithm
1. Start at any vertex if finding an Euler circuit. If finding an Euler path, start at one

    of the two vertices with odd degree.
2. Choose any edge leaving your current vertex, provided deleting that edge will not

    separate the graph into two disconnected sets of edges.
3. Add that edge to your circuit, and delete it from the graph.
4. Continue until you're done.

Example 10
     Let's find an Euler Circuit on this graph using Fleury's algorithm, starting at vertex A.

Original Graph.                AD deleted. D is current.      E is current.
Choosing edge AD.              Can't choose DC since that     From here, there is only one

     Eulerization and the Chinese Postman Problem
     Not every graph has an Euler path or circuit, yet our lawn inspector still needs to do her
     inspections. Her goal is to minimize the amount of walking she has to do. In order to do
     that, she will have to duplicate some edges in the graph until an Euler circuit exists.

         Eulerization
         Eulerization is the process of adding edges to a graph to create an Euler circuit on a
         graph. To eulerize a graph, edges are duplicated to connect pairs of vertices with odd
         degree. Connecting two odd degree vertices increases the degree of each, giving them
         both even degree. When two odd degree vertices are not directly connected, we can
         duplicate all edges in a path connecting the two.

     Note that we can only duplicate edges, not create edges where there wasn't one before.
     Duplicating edges would mean walking or driving down a road twice, while creating an edge
     where there wasn't one before is akin to installing a new road!

Example 11
     For the rectangular graph shown, three possible eulerizations are shown. Notice in each of
     these cases the vertices that started with odd degrees have even degrees after eulerization,
     allowing for an Euler circuit.

In the example above, you'll notice that the last eulerization required duplicating seven
edges, while the first two only required duplicating five edges. If we were eulerizing the
graph to find a walking path, we would want the eulerization with minimal duplications. If
the edges had weights representing distances or costs, then we would want to select the
eulerization with the minimal total added weight.

Example 12
     Looking again at the graph for our lawn inspector from Examples 1 and 8, the vertices with
     odd degree are shown highlighted. With eight vertices, we will always have to duplicate at
     least four edges. In this case, we need to duplicate five edges since two odd degree vertices
     are not directly connected. Without weights we can't be certain this is the eulerization that
     minimizes walking distance, but it looks pretty good.

     The problem of finding the optimal eulerization is called the Chinese Postman Problem, a
     name given by an American in honor of the Chinese mathematician Mei-Ko Kwan who first
     studied the problem in 1962 while trying to find optimal delivery routes for postal carriers.
     This problem is important in determining efficient routes for garbage trucks, school buses,
     parking meter checkers, street sweepers, and more.

     Unfortunately, algorithms to solve this problem are fairly complex. Some simpler cases are
     considered in the exercises.

 Hamiltonian Circuits and the Traveling Salesman Problem
     In the last section, we considered optimizing a walking route for a postal carrier. How is this
     different than the requirements of a package delivery driver? While the postal carrier needed
     to walk down every street (edge) to deliver the mail, the package delivery driver instead
     needs to visit every one of a set of delivery locations. Instead of looking for a circuit that
     covers every edge once, the package deliverer is interested in a circuit that visits every vertex
     once.

         Hamiltonian Circuits and Paths
         A Hamiltonian circuit is a circuit that visits every vertex once with no repeats. Being
         a circuit, it must start and end at the same vertex. A Hamiltonian path also visits
         every vertex once with no repeats, but does not have to start and end at the same
         vertex.

     Hamiltonian circuits are named for William Rowan Hamilton who studied them in the
     1800's.
                                                                            Graph Theory 133

Example 13

     One Hamiltonian circuit is shown on the graph below. There are several other Hamiltonian
     circuits possible on this graph. Notice that the circuit only has to visit every vertex once; it
     does not need to use every edge.

This circuit could be notated by the sequence of vertices visited, starting and ending at the
same vertex: ABFGCDHMLKJEA. Notice that the same circuit could be written in reverse
order, or starting and ending at a different vertex.

     Unlike with Euler circuits, there is no nice theorem that allows us to instantly determine
     whether or not a Hamiltonian circuit exists for all graphs.4

Example 14
     Does a Hamiltonian path or circuit exist on the graph below?

             B

                                C

     We can see that once we travel to vertex E there is no way to leave without returning to C, so
     there is no possibility of a Hamiltonian circuit. If we start at vertex E we can find several
     Hamiltonian paths, such as ECDAB and ECABD.

With Hamiltonian circuits, our focus will not be on existence, but on the question of
optimization; given a graph where the edges have weights, can we find the optimal
Hamiltonian circuit; the one with lowest total weight.

This problem is called the Traveling            Home (Seattle)
salesman problem (TSP) because the
question can be framed like this: Suppose a                    $70                $120      Dallas
salesman needs to give sales pitches in four
cities. He looks up the airfares between each   LA $150                     $140 $165
city, and puts the costs in a graph. In what                                           $85
order should he travel to visit each city once       $100 $170 $145
then return home with the lowest cost?                                 $75         Atlanta

                                                       Chicago

4 There are some theorems that can be used in specific circumstances, such as Dirac's theorem, which says that
a Hamiltonian circuit must exist on a graph with n vertices if each vertex has degree n/2 or greater.
134

To answer this question of how to find the lowest cost Hamiltonian circuit, we will consider
some possible approaches. The first option that might come to mind is to just try all different
possible circuits.

   Brute Force Algorithm (a.k.a. exhaustive search)
   1. List all possible Hamiltonian circuits
   2. Find the length of each circuit by adding the edge weights
   3. Select the circuit with minimal total weight.

Example 15
     Apply the Brute force algorithm to find the minimum cost Hamiltonian circuit on the graph
     below.

                       A

                               1

                     4 D2
                B9 8C

                              13

To apply the Brute force algorithm, we list all possible Hamiltonian circuits and calculate

their weight:

Circuit        Weight

ABCDA          4+13+8+1 = 26

ABDCA          4+9+8+2 = 23

ACBDA          2+13+9+1 = 25

Note: These are the unique circuits on this graph. All other possible circuits are the reverse

of the listed ones or start at a different vertex, but result in the same weights.

From this we can see that the second circuit, ABDCA, is the optimal circuit.

The Brute force algorithm is optimal; it will always produce the Hamiltonian circuit with
minimum weight. Is it efficient? To answer that question, we need to consider how many
Hamiltonian circuits a graph could have. For simplicity, let's look at the worst-case
possibility, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This is called a complete
graph.

Suppose we had a complete graph with five vertices like the air travel graph above. From
Seattle there are four cities we can visit first. From each of those, there are three choices.
From each of those cities, there are two possible cities to visit next. There is then only one
choice for the last city before returning home.
                                                                 Graph Theory 135

This can be shown visually:

                                     Home (Seattle)

   LA                        Dallas                  Chicago        Atlanta

D  C       A  L              C       A  D            L        A  D  C        L

CA DA CD      CA LA CL                  L A DA L D               CL DL CD
AC A D D C    AC AL L C                 AL A D D L               LC L D DC

Counting the number of routes, we can see there are 4 3 2 1 =24 routes. For six cities there
would be 5 4 3 2 1 =120 routes.

Number of Possible Circuits
For n vertices in a complete graph, there will be (n -1)! = (n -1)(n - 2)(n - 3)3 2 1
routes. Half of these are duplicates in reverse order, so there are (n -1)! unique

                                                                                   2
circuits.

The exclamation symbol, !, is read "factorial" and is shorthand for the product shown.

Example 16
     How many circuits would a complete graph with 8 vertices have?

     A complete graph with 8 vertices would have (8 -1)! = 7! = 7  6 5 4 3 2 1 = 5040 possible
     Hamiltonian circuits. Half of the circuits are duplicates of other circuits but in reverse order,
     leaving 2520 unique routes.

While this is a lot, it doesn't seem unreasonably huge. But consider what happens as the
number of cities increase:

   Cities     Unique Hamiltonian Circuits
   9          8!/2 = 20,160
   10         9!/2 = 181,440
   11         10!/2 = 1,814,400
   15         14!/2 = 43,589,145,600
   20         19!/2 = 60,822,550,204,416,000

As you can see the number of circuits is growing extremely quickly. If a computer looked at
one billion circuits a second, it would still take almost two years to examine all the possible
circuits with only 20 cities! Certainly Brute Force is not an efficient algorithm.
136

Unfortunately, no one has yet found an efficient and optimal algorithm to solve the TSP, and
it is very unlikely anyone ever will. Since it is not practical to use brute force to solve the
problem, we turn instead to heuristic algorithms; efficient algorithms that give approximate
solutions. In other words, heuristic algorithms are fast, but may or may not produce the
optimal circuit.

Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (NNA)
1. Select a starting point.
2. Move to the nearest unvisited vertex (the edge with smallest weight).
3. Repeat until the circuit is complete.

Example 17

Consider our earlier graph, shown to the right.

Starting at vertex A, the nearest neighbor is vertex D with a weight of 1.            A

From D, the nearest neighbor is C, with a weight of 8.                                     1
From C, our only option is to move to vertex B, the only unvisited vertex,
with a cost of 13.                                                                    4 D2

From B we return to A with a weight of 4.                                             B9 8C

                                                                                                 13

The resulting circuit is ADCBA with a total weight of 1+8+13+4 = 26.

We ended up finding the worst circuit in the graph! What happened? Unfortunately, while it
is very easy to implement, the NNA is a greedy algorithm, meaning it only looks at the
immediate decision without considering the consequences in the future. In this case,
following the edge AD forced us to use the very expensive edge BC later.

Example 18                                                    Home (Seattle)
     Consider again our salesman. Starting in Seattle,
     the nearest neighbor (cheapest flight) is to LA, at                 $70                $120      Dallas
     a cost of $70. From there:
                                                          LA $150                     $140 $165
     LA to Chicago: $100                                                                         $85
     Chicago to Atlanta: $75                                   $100 $170 $145
     Atlanta to Dallas: $85                                                      $75         Atlanta
     Dallas to Seattle: $120
     Total cost: $450                                            Chicago

In this case, nearest neighbor did find the optimal circuit.

Going back to our first example, how could we improve the outcome? One option would be
to redo the nearest neighbor algorithm with a different starting point to see if the result
changed. Since nearest neighbor is so fast, doing it several times isn't a big deal.
                                                                                 Graph Theory 137

Repeated Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (RNNA)
1. Do the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm starting at each vertex
2. Choose the circuit produced with minimal total weight

Example 19                                                                          A
     We will revisit the graph from Example 17.
                                                                                         1
     Starting at vertex A resulted in a circuit with weight 26.
                                                                                  4 D2
     Starting at vertex B, the nearest neighbor circuit is BADCB with a      B9 8C
     weight of 4+1+8+13 = 26. This is the same circuit we found starting at
     vertex A. No better.                                                               13

Starting at vertex C, the nearest neighbor circuit is CADBC with a weight of 2+1+9+13 = 25.
Better!

Starting at vertex D, the nearest neighbor circuit is DACBA. Notice that this is actually the
same circuit we found starting at C, just written with a different starting vertex.

The RNNA was able to produce a slightly better circuit with a weight of 25, but still not the
optimal circuit in this case. Notice that even though we found the circuit by starting at vertex
C, we could still write the circuit starting at A: ADBCA or ACBDA.

a. Find the circuit generated by the NNA starting at vertex B.
b. Find the circuit generated by the RNNA.
138

While certainly better than the basic NNA, unfortunately, the RNNA is still greedy and will
produce very bad results for some graphs. As an alternative, our next approach will step
back and look at the "big picture" - it will select first the edges that are shortest, and then fill
in the gaps.

Sorted Edges Algorithm (a.k.a. Cheapest Link Algorithm)
 1. Select the cheapest unused edge in the graph.
 2. Repeat step 1, adding the cheapest unused edge to the circuit, unless:
          a. adding the edge would create a circuit that doesn't contain all vertices, or
          b. adding the edge would give a vertex degree 3.
 3. Repeat until a circuit containing all vertices is formed.

Example 20
     Using the four vertex graph from earlier, we can use the Sorted Edges algorithm.

The cheapest edge is AD, with a cost of 1. We highlight that edge to mark it selected.
The next shortest edge is AC, with a weight of 2, so we highlight that edge.

A                 A

            1                 1

     4 D2              4 D2
B9 8C             B9 8C

           13                13

For the third edge, we'd like to add AB, but that would give vertex A degree 3, which is not
allowed in a Hamiltonian circuit. The next shortest edge is CD, but that edge would create a
circuit ACDA that does not include vertex B, so we reject that edge. The next shortest edge
is BD, so we add that edge to the graph.

       A                 A                 A
             BAD               BAD               OK

            1                 1                 1

     4 D2              4 D2              4 D2
B9 8C             B9 8C             B9 8C

           13                13                13

We then add the last edge to complete the circuit: ACBDA with                 A
weight 25.
                                                                                   1
Notice that the algorithm did not produce the optimal circuit in this
case; the optimal circuit is ACDBA with weight 23.                          4 D2
                                                                       B9 8C

While the Sorted Edge algorithm overcomes some of the shortcomings of NNA, it is still
only a heuristic algorithm, and does not guarantee the optimal circuit.

Using NNA with a large number of cities, you might find it helpful to mark off the cities as
they're visited to keep from accidently visiting them again. Looking in the row for Portland,
the smallest distance is 47, to Salem. Following that idea, our circuit will be:

Portland to Salem        47                                 Ashland Astoria
Salem to Corvallis       40                                                       Bend

Total trip length:       1266 miles

Using Sorted Edges, you might find it helpful to   Salem               Corvallis
draw an empty graph, perhaps by drawing
vertices in a circular pattern. Adding edges to
the graph as you select them will help you
visualize any circuits or vertices with degree 3.

We start adding the shortest edges:

Seaside to Astoria   17 miles                              Seaside   Ashland Astoria
Corvallis to Salem   40 miles                                                              Bend
Portland to Salem    47 miles
Corvallis to Eugene  47 miles

The graph after adding these edges is shown to the         Salem                           Corvallis
right. The next shortest edge is from Corvallis to
Newport at 52 miles, but adding that edge would give       Portland                    Crater Lk
Corvallis degree 3.                                                    Newport  Eugene

Continuing on, we can skip over any edge pair that
contains Salem or Corvallis, since they both already
have degree 2.

The graph after adding these edges is shown to the         Portland                    Crater Lk
right. At this point, we can skip over any edge pair                  Newport   Eugene

Corvallis since they already have degree 2.

Bend to Ashland                 200 miles

At this point the only way to complete the circuit is to   Seaside
add:
Crater Lk to Astoria 433 miles                             Salem                                 Corvallis

The final circuit, written to start at Portland, is:       Portland             Crater Lk
Portland, Salem, Corvallis, Eugene, Newport, Bend,
Ashland, Crater Lake, Astoria, Seaside, Portland.

Total trip length: 1241 miles.                                       Newport    Eugene

While better than the NNA route, neither algorithm produced the optimal route. The
following route can make the tour in 1069 miles:

link made. The costs, in thousands of dollars per  D                            C

year, are shown in the graph.

In this case, we don't need to find a circuit, or even a specific path; all we need to do is make
sure we can make a call from any office to any other. In other words, we need to be sure
there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex.

Spanning Tree
A spanning tree is a connected graph using all vertices in which there are no circuits.
In other words, there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex, but no circuits.

Some examples of spanning trees are shown below. Notice there are no circuits in the trees,
and it is fine to have vertices with degree higher than two.

Usually we have a starting graph to work from, like in the phone example above. In this
case, we form our spanning tree by finding a subgraph - a new graph formed using all the
vertices but only some of the edges from the original graph. No edges will be created where
they didn't already exist.

Of course, any random spanning tree isn't really what we want. We want the minimum cost
spanning tree (MCST).
142

   Minimum Cost Spanning Tree (MCST)
   The minimum cost spanning tree is the spanning tree with the smallest total edge
   weight.

A nearest neighbor style approach doesn't make as much sense here since we don't need a
circuit, so instead we will take an approach similar to sorted edges.

   Kruskal's Algorithm
     1. Select the cheapest unused edge in the graph.
     2. Repeat step 1, adding the cheapest unused edge, unless:
                   a. adding the edge would create a circuit
     3. Repeat until a spanning tree is formed

Example 22

Using our phone line graph from above, begin adding edges:

AB $4 OK                                                             A

AE $5 OK

BE $6       reject - closes circuit ABEA           E $6 $5 $4 B
DC $7       OK
AC $8       OK                                                  $11     $8 $14

                                                   $13

                                                            $9          $10

At this point we stop - every vertex is now                     $7

connected, so we have formed a spanning tree with  D                    C

cost $24 thousand a year.

Remarkably, Kruskal's algorithm is both optimal and efficient; we are guaranteed to always
produce the optimal MCST.

33. Social networks such as Facebook and LinkedIn can be represented using graphs in
    which vertices represent people and edges are drawn between two vertices when
    those people are "friends." The table below shows a friendship table, where an X

         movie (note the movie name on the edge). Find interesting paths between
         actors, and quiz the other groups to see if they can guess the connections.

34. A spell checker in a word processing program makes suggestions when it finds a
    word not in the dictionary. To determine what words to suggest, it tries to find
    similar words. One measure of word similarity is the Levenshtein distance, which
    measures the number of substitutions, additions, or deletions that are required to
    change one word into another. For example, the words spit and spot are a distance of
    1 apart; changing spit to spot requires one substitution (i for o). Likewise, spit is
    distance 1 from pit since the change requires one deletion (the s). The word spite is
    also distance 1 from spit since it requires one addition (the e). The word soot is
    distance 2 from spit since two substitutions would be required.
         a. Create a graph using words as vertices, and edges connecting words with a
             Levenshtein distance of 1. Use the misspelled word "moke" as the center, and
             try to find at least 10 connected dictionary words. How might a spell checker
             use this graph?
         b. Improve the method from above by assigning a weight to each edge based on
             the likelihood of making the substitution, addition, or deletion. You can base
             the weights on any reasonable approach: proximity of keys on a keyboard,
             common language errors, etc. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the length of
             the shortest path from each word to "moke". How might a spell checker use
             these values?

35. The graph below contains two vertices of odd degree. To eulerize this graph, it is
    necessary to duplicate edges connecting those two vertices.
         a. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the two vertices
             with odd degree. Does this produce the most efficient eulerization and solve
             the Chinese Postman Problem for this graph?

                           Scheduling 155

Scheduling

     An event planner has to juggle many workers completing different tasks, some of which must
     be completed before others can begin. For example, the banquet tables would need to be
     arranged in the room before the catering staff could begin setting out silverware. The event
     planner has to carefully schedule things so that everything gets done in a reasonable amount
     of time.

     The problem of scheduling is fairly universal. Contractors need to schedule workers and
     subcontractors to build a house as quickly as possible. A magazine needs to schedule
     writers, editors, photographers, typesetters, and others so that an issue can be completed on
     time.

 Getting Started
     To begin thinking about scheduling, let us consider an auto shop that is converting a car from
     gas to electric. A number of steps are involved. A time estimate for each task is given.

     Task 1: Remove engine and gas parts (2 days)
     Task 2: Steam clean the inside of the car (0.5 day)
     Task 3: Buy an electric motor and speed controller (2 days for travel)
     Task 4: Construct the part that connects the motor to the car's transmission (1 day)
     Task 5: Construct battery racks (2 days)
     Task 6: Install the motor (0.5 day)
     Task 7: Install the speed controller (0.5 day)
     Task 8: Install the battery racks (0.5 day)
     Task 9: Wire the electricity (1 day)

     Some tasks have to be completed before others - we certainly can't install the new motor
     before removing the old engine! There are some tasks, however, that can be worked on
     simultaneously by two different people, like constructing the battery racks and installing the
     motor.

     To help us visualize the ordering of tasks, we will create a digraph.

         Digraph
         A diagraph is a graphical representation of a set of tasks in which tasks are represented
         with dots, called vertices, and arrows between vertices are used to show ordering.

For example, this digraph shows that Task 1, notated T1 for compactness, needs to be
completed before Task 2. The number in parentheses after the task name is the time required
for the task.

T1 (2)           T2 (0.5)

© David Lippman            Creative Commons BY-SA
156

Example 1
     A complete digraph for our car conversion would look like this:

     T1 (2)      T2 (0.5)

     T3 (2)                T6 (0.5)  T9 (1)
     T4 (1)                T7 (0.5)
     T5 (2)                T8 (0.5)

The time it takes to complete this job will partially depend upon how many people are
working on the project.

   Processors
   In scheduling jargon, the workers completing the tasks are called processors. While in
   this example the processors are humans, in some situations the processors are
   computers, robots, or other machines.

For simplicity, we are going to make the very big assumptions that every processor can do
every task, that they all would take the same time to complete it, and that only one processor
can work on a task at a time.

   Finishing Time
   The finishing time is how long it will take to complete all the tasks. The finishing time
   will depend upon the number of processors and the specific schedule.

If we had only one processor working on this task, it is easy to determine the finishing time;
just add up the individual times. We assume one person can't work on two tasks at the same
time, ignore things like drying times during which someone could work on another task.
Scheduling with one processor, a possible schedule would look like this, with a finishing
time of 10 days.

     Time: 0 1   2 3       4 5 6     7 8 9 10

     P1      T1  T3        T4 T5     T2 T6 T7 T8 T9

In this schedule, all the ordering requirements are met. This is certainly not the only possible
schedule for one processor, but no other schedule could complete the job in less time.
Because of this, this is an optimal schedule with optimal finishing time - there is nothing
better.
                                                                                     Scheduling 157

Optimal Schedule
An optimal schedule is the schedule with the shortest possible finishing time.

For two processors, things become more interesting. For small digraphs like this, we
probably could fiddle around and guess-and-check a pretty good schedule. Here would be a
possibility:

Time: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

P1  T1     T3           T6 T9

P2  T5     T4 T2 T8 T7

With two processors, the finishing time was reduced to 5.5 days. What was processor 2
doing during the last day? Nothing, because there were no tasks for the processor to do.
This is called idle time.

Idle Time
Idle time is time in the schedule when there are no tasks available for the processor to
work on, so they sit idle.

Is this schedule optimal? Could it have been completed in 5 days? Because every other task
had to be completed before task 9 could start, there would be no way that both processors
could be busy during task 9, so it is not possible to create a shorter schedule.

So how long will it take if we use three processors? About 10/3 = 3.33 days? Again we will
guess-and-check a schedule:

Time: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

P1  T1     T2 T6 T8 T9

P2  T3         T7

P3  T4 T5

With three processors, the job still took 4.5 days. It is a little harder to tell whether this
schedule is optimal. However, it might be helpful to notice that since Task 1, 2, 6, and 9
have to be completed sequentially, there is no way that this job could be completed in less
than 2+0.5+0.5+1 = 4 days, regardless of the number of processors. Four days is, for this
digraph, the absolute minimum time to complete the job, called the critical time.

Critical Time
The critical time is the absolute minimum time to complete the job, regardless of the
number of processors working on the tasks.

Critical time can be determined by looking at the longest sequence of tasks in the
digraph, called the critical path
   158

Adding an algorithm
   Up until now, we have been creating schedules by guess-and-check, which works well
   enough for small schedules, but would not work well with dozens or hundreds of tasks. To
   create a more procedural approach, we might begin by somehow creating a priority list.
   Once we have a priority list, we can begin scheduling using that list and the list processing
   algorithm.

       Priority List
       A priority list is a list of tasks given in the order in which we desire them to be
       completed.

       The List Processing Algorithm turns a priority list into a schedule

List Processing Algorithm
1. On the digraph or priority list, circle all tasks that are ready, meaning that all pre-

    requisite tasks have been completed.
2. Assign to each available processor, in order, the first ready task. Mark the task as

    in progress, perhaps by putting a single line through the task.
3. Move forward in time until a task is completed. Mark the task as completed,

    perhaps by crossing out the task. If any new tasks become ready, mark them as
    such.
4. Repeat until all tasks have been scheduled.

Example 2
     Using our digraph from above, schedule it using the priority list below:
     T1, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T2, T9

Time 0: Mark ready tasks

Priority list: T1, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T2, T9

We assign the first task, T1 to the first processor, P1, and the second ready task, T3, to the
second processor. Making those assignments, we mark those tasks as in progress:

With the last task completed, we have a completed schedule, with finishing time 5.5 days.

Try it Now 1
Using the digraph below, create a schedule using the priority list:
T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9

T1 (10)  T2 (7)          T3 (4)

 T4 (9)  T5 (5)           T6 (4)
T7 (13)      T8 (4)      T9 (6)

   It is important to note that the list processing algorithm itself does not influence the resulting
   schedule - the schedule is completely determined by the priority list followed. The list
   processing, while do-able by hand, could just as easily be executed by a computer. The
   interesting part of scheduling, then, is how to choose a priority list that will create the best
   possible schedule.

Choosing a priority list
   We will explore two algorithms for selecting a priority list.

   Decreasing time algorithm
   The decreasing time algorithm takes the approach of trying to get the very long tasks out of
   the way as soon as possible by putting them first on the priority list.

       Decreasing Time Algorithm
       Create the priority list by listing the tasks in order from longest completion time to
       shortest completion time.
                                                                   Scheduling 161

Example 3

     Consider the scheduling problem represented by the digraph below. Create a priority list
     using the decreasing time list algorithm, then use it to schedule for two processors using the
     list processing algorithm.

To use the decreasing time list algorithm,      T1 (6)  T5 (5)                T9 (2)
we create our priority list by listing the      T2 (3)
tasks in order from longest task time to        T3 (7)  T6 (10)    T8 (3) T10 (7)
shortest task time. If there is a tie, we will  T4 (4)
list the task with smaller task number first            T7 (4)
(not for any good reason, but just for
consistency).

For this digraph, the decreasing time
algorithm would create a priority list of:

T6 (10), T3 (7), T10 (7), T1 (6), T5 (5), T4 (4), T7 (4), T2 (3), T8 (3), T9 (2)

Once we have the priority list, we can create the schedule using the list processing algorithm.
With two processors, we'd get:

Time 0: We identify ready tasks, and assign T3 to P1 and T1 to P2

Priority list: T6, T3, T10, T1, T5, T4, T7, T2, T8, T9

        7

P1  T3

P2  T1

                      6
Time 6: P2 completes T1. No new tasks become ready, so T4 is assigned to P2.

This is our completed schedule, with a finishing time of 35.
                                                                                        Scheduling 163

Using the decreasing time algorithm, the priority list led to a schedule with a finishing time
of 35. Is this good? It certainly looks like there was a lot of idle time in this schedule. To
get some idea how good or bad this schedule is, we could compute the critical time, the
minimum time to complete the job. To find this, we look for the sequence of tasks with the
highest total completion time. For this digraph that sequence would appear to be: T2, T6, T5,
T8, T10, with total sequence time of 28. From this we can conclude that our schedule isn't
horrible, but there is a possibility that a better schedule exists.

Try it Now 2
Determine the priority list for the digraph from Try it Now 1 using the decreasing time
algorithm.

Critical path algorithm
A sequence of tasks in the digraph is called a path. In the previous example, we saw that the
critical path dictates the minimum completion time for a schedule. Perhaps, then, it would
make sense to consider the critical path when creating our schedule. For example, in the last
schedule, the processors began working on tasks 1 and 3 because they were longer tasks, but
starting on task 2 earlier would have allowed work to begin on the long task 6 earlier.

The critical path algorithm allows you to create a priority list based on idea of critical paths.

   Critical Path Algorithm (version 1)
   1. Find the critical path.
   2. The first task in the critical path gets added to the priority list.
   3. Remove that task from the digraph
   4. Repeat, finding the new critical path with the revised digraph.

Example 4
     The original digraph from Example 3 has critical path T2, T6, T5, T8, T10, so T2 gets added
     first to the priority list. Removing T2 from the digraph, it now looks like:

T1 (6)  T5 (5)           T9 (2)

        T6 (10)  T8 (3)  T10 (7)

T3 (7)  T7 (4)
T4 (4)

The critical path (longest path) in the remaining digraph is now T6, T5, T8, T10, so T6 is added
to the priority list and removed.
164                T5 (5)  T9 (2)
           T1 (6)

T3 (7)                       T8 (3) T10 (7)
T4 (4)             T7 (4)

Now there are two paths with the same longest length: T1, T5, T8, T10 and T3, T7, T8, T10. We
can add T1 to the priority list (or T3 - we usually add the one with smaller item number) and
remove it, and continue the process.

I'm sure you can imagine that searching for the critical path every time you remove a task
from the digraph would get really tiring, especially for a large digraph. In practice, the
critical path algorithm is implementing by first working from the end backwards. This is
called the backflow algorithm.

Backflow Algorithm
1. Introduce an "end" vertex, and assign it a time of 0, shown in [brackets]
2. Move backwards to every vertex that has an arrow to the end and assign it a critical

    time
3. From each of those vertices, move backwards and assign those vertices critical

    times. Notice that the critical time for the earlier vertex will be that task's time plus
    the critical time for the later vertex.
    Example: Consider this segment of digraph.

                   T1 (5)  T2 (4) [10]

In this case, if T2 has already been determined to have a critical time of 10, then T1
will have a critical time of 5+10 = 15

                      T1 (5) [15] T2 (4) [10]

If you have already assigned a critical time to a vertex, replace it only if the new
time is larger.
Example: In the digraph below, T1 should be labeled with a critical time of 16,
since it is the longer of 5+10 and 5+11.

                   T1 (5)  T2 (4) [10]

                           T3 (5) [11]

4. Repeat until all vertices are labeled with their critical times
                                                                                        Scheduling 165

One you have completed the backflow algorithm, you can easily create the critical path
priority list by using the critical times you just found.

   Critical Path Algorithm (version 2)
   1. Apply the backflow algorithm to the digraph
   2. Create the priority list by listing the tasks in order from longest critical time to

        shortest critical time

This version of the Critical Path Algorithm will usually be the easier to implement.

Example 5
     Applying this to our digraph from the earlier example, we start applying the backflow
     algorithm.

We add an end vertex and give it a critical time of 0.

T1 (6)      T5 (5)           T9 (2)

T2 (3)      T6 (10)  T8 (3)  T10 (7)
T3 (7)
T4 (4)                                                  End [0]

            T7 (4)

We then move back to T4, T9, and T10, labeling them with their critical times

T1 (6)      T5 (5)           T9 (2) [2]

T2 (3) T6 (10)       T8 (3)  T10 (7) [7]
                                          End [0]
T3 (7)
T4 (4) [4]  T7 (4)

From each vertex marked with a critical time, we go back. T7, for example, will get labeled
with a critical time 11 - the task time of 4 plus the critical time of 7 for T10. For T5, there are
two paths to the end. We use the longer, labeling T5 with critical time 5+7 = 12.
166

     T1 (6)          T5 (5) [12]          T9 (2) [2]

     T2 (3)       T6 (10)    T8 (3) [10] T10 (7) [7]
     T3 (7)                                            End [0]

     T4 (4) [4]      T7 (4) [14]

Continue the process until all vertices are labeled. Notice that the critical time for T5 ended
got replaced later with the even longer path through T8.

     T1 (6) [21] T5 (5) [15]              T9 (2) [2]

     T2 (3) [28] T6 (10) [25] T8 (3) [10] T10 (7) [7]

     T3 (7) [21]                                            End [0]

     T4 (4) [4]      T7 (4) [14]

We can now quickly create the critical path priority list by listing the tasks in decreasing
order of critical time:

Priority list: T2, T6, T1, T3, T5, T7, T8, T10, T4, T9

Applying this priority list using the list processing algorithm, we get the schedule:

         3                   13       18 21                      28

P1   T2              T6           T5      T8                T10

P2       T1              T3       T7      T4            T9

                  6                   17                23

In this particular case, we were able to achieve the minimum possible completion time with
this schedule, suggesting that this schedule is optimal. This is certainly not always the case.

Example 6

     This example is designed to show that the critical path algorithm doesn't always work
     wonderfully. Schedule the tasks in the digraph below on three processors using the critical
     path algorithm.

       T1 (1)          T6 (2)

       T2 (1)                         T9 (6)
       T3 (1)
       T4 (6)          T7 (2)
       T5 (6)          T8 (2)

To create a critical path priority list, we could first apply the backflow algorithm:

    T1 (1) [9]         T6 (2) [8]

    T2 (1) [1]                        T9 (6) [6]
      T3 (1) [1]
      T4 (6) [6]   T7 (2) [8]
      T5 (6) [6]
                       T8 (2) [8]

This yields the critical-path priority list: T1, T6, T7, T8, T4, T5, T9, T2, T3.
Applying the list processing algorithm to this priority list leads to the schedule:

       1 3             5           7                         13

P1 T1  T6          T7     T8                      T9

P2             T4              T2

P3             T5              T3

                          6

This schedule has finishing time of 13.
168

By observation, we can see that a much better schedule exists for the example above:

         1 3                             9

P1 T1 T6                   T9

P2 T2 T7                   T5

P3 T3 T8                   T4

In most cases the critical path algorithm will lead to a very good schedule. There are cases,
like this, where it will not. Unfortunately, there is no known algorithm to always produce the
optimal schedule.

Exploration
    27. Independent tasks are ones that have no order requirements; they can be completed in
         any order.
             a. Consider three tasks, with completion times 2, 2, and 4 hours respectively.
                  Construct two different schedules on two processors with different completion
                  times to show that the priority list still matters with independent tasks.
             b. Choose a set of independent tasks with different completion times, and
                  implement the decreasing time list algorithm and the critical path algorithm.
                  What do you observe?
             c. Will using the decreasing time list or critical path algorithms with independent
                  tasks always produce an optimal schedule? Why or why not?
             d. Will using the decreasing time list or critical path algorithms with independent
                  tasks always produce the same schedule? Why or why not?

    28. In a group, choose ten tasks necessary to throw a birthday party for a friend or child
         (for example, cleaning the house or buying a cake). Determine order requirements
         for the tasks, create a digraph, and schedule the tasks for two people.

    29-37: At the end of the chapter it was noted that no algorithm exists to determine if an
    arbitrary schedule is optimal, but there are special cases where we can determine that a
    schedule is indeed optimal. In each of the following scenarios, determine

         a) If the scenario is even possible
         b) Whether or not the schedule could be optimal
         c) Whether or not we can be sure that the schedule is optimal

    29. A job has a critical time of 30 hours, and the finishing time for the schedule on 2
         processors is 30 hours.

    30. The sum of all task times for a job is 40 hours, and the finishing time for the schedule
         on 2 processors was 15 hours

    31. The sum of all task times for a job is 100 hours, the critical time of the job was 40
         hours, and the finishing time for the schedule on 2 processors was 50 hours.

    32. The sum of all task times for a job is 50 hours, and the finishing time for the schedule
         on 2 processors was 40 hours.

    33. A job has a critical time of 30 hours, and the finishing time for the schedule on 3
         processors is 20 hours.

    34. The sum of all task times for a job is 60 hours, and the finishing time for the schedule
         on 3 processors was 20 hours.

    35. The critical time for a job is 25 hours, and the finishing time for the schedule on 2
         processors was 30 hours.

    36. The sum of all task times for a job is 20 hours, and the finishing time for the schedule
         on 2 processors was 25 hours.

    37. Based on your observations in the previous scenarios, write guidelines for when you
         can determine that a schedule is optimal.
                 Growth Models 173

Growth Models

     Populations of people, animals, and items are growing all around us. By understanding how
     things grow, we can better understand what to expect in the future. In this chapter, we focus
     on time-dependant change.

 Linear (Algebraic) Growth
     Marco is a collector of antique soda bottles. His collection currently contains 437 bottles.
     Every year, he budgets enough money to buy 32 new bottles. Can we determine how many
     bottles he will have in 5 years, and how long it will take for his collection to reach 1000
     bottles?

     While both of these questions you could probably solve without an equation or formal
     mathematics, we are going to formalize our approach to this problem to provide a means to
     answer more complicated questions.

     Suppose that Pn represents the number, or population, of bottles Marco has after n years. So
     P0 would represent the number of bottles now, P1 would represent the number of bottles after
     1 year, P2 would represent the number of bottles after 2 years, and so on. We could describe
     how Marco's bottle collection is changing using:

     P0 = 437
     Pn = Pn-1 + 32

     This is called a recursive relationship. A recursive relationship is a formula which relates
     the next value in a sequence to the previous values. Here, the number of bottles in year n can
     be found by adding 32 to the number of bottles in the previous year, Pn-1. Using this
     relationship, we could calculate:

     P1 = P0 + 32 = 437 + 32 = 469
     P2 = P1 + 32 = 469 + 32 = 501
     P3 = P2 + 32 = 501 + 32 = 533
     P4 = P3 + 32 = 533 + 32 = 565
     P5 = P4 + 32 = 565 + 32 = 597

     We have answered the question of how many bottles Marco will have in 5 years. However,
     solving how long it will take for his collection to reach 1000 bottles would require a lot more
     calculations.

     While recursive relationships are excellent for describing simply and cleanly how a quantity
     is changing, they are not convenient for making predictions or solving problems that stretch
     far into the future. For that, a closed or explicit form for the relationship is preferred. An
     explicit equation allows us to calculate Pn directly, without needing to know Pn-1. While
     you may already be able to guess the explicit equation, let us derive it from the recursive
     formula. We can do so by selectively not simplifying as we go:

174

P1 = 437 + 32                      = 437 + 1(32)
P2 = P1 + 32 = 437 + 32 + 32       = 437 + 2(32)
P3 = P2 + 32 = (437 + 2(32)) + 32  = 437 + 3(32)
P4 = P3 + 32 = (437 + 3(32)) + 32  = 437 + 4(32)

You can probably see the pattern now, and generalize that
Pn = 437 + n(32) = 437 + 32n

Using this equation, we can calculate how many bottles he'll have after 5 years:
P5 = 437 + 32(5) = 437 + 160 = 597

We can now also solve for when the collection will reach 1000 bottles by substituting in
1000 for Pn and solving for n

1000 = 437 + 32n                                                    700
563 = 32n
n = 563/32 = 17.59                                                  600

So Marco will reach 1000 bottles in 18 years.                       500

In the previous example, Marco's collection grew by        Bottles  400
the same number of bottles every year. This constant
change is the defining characteristic of linear growth.             300
Plotting the values we calculated for Marco's
collection, we can see the values form a straight line,             200
the shape of linear growth.
                                                                    100

                                                                    0

                                                                         0  1  2  3            4    5

                                                                               Years from now

Linear Growth
If a quantity starts at size P0 and grows by d every time period, then the quantity after n
time periods can be determined using either of these relations:

Recursive form:
Pn = Pn-1 + d

Explicit form:
Pn = P0 + d n

In this equation, d represents the common difference - the amount that the population
changes each time n increases by 1

Connection to prior learning - slope and intercept

     You may recognize the common difference, d, in our linear equation as slope. In fact, the
     entire explicit equation should look familiar - it is the same linear equation you learned in
     algebra, probably stated as y = mx + b.
                                                                                   Growth Models 175

In the standard algebraic equation y = mx + b, b was the y-intercept, or the y value when x
was zero. In the form of the equation we're using, we are using P0 to represent that initial
amount.

In the y = mx + b equation, recall that m was the slope. You might remember this as "rise
over run", or the change in y divided by the change in x. Either way, it represents the same
thing as the common difference, d, we are using - the amount the output Pn changes when
the input n increases by 1.

The equations y = mx + b and Pn = P0 + d n mean the same thing and can be used the same
ways, we're just writing it somewhat differently.

Example 1

     The population of elk in a national forest was measured to be 12,000 in 2003, and was
     measured again to be 15,000 in 2007. If the population continues to grow linearly at this
     rate, what will the elk population be in 2014?

To begin, we need to define how we're going to measure n. Remember that P0 is the
population when n = 0, so we probably don't want to literally use the year 0. Since we
already know the population in 2003, let us define n = 0 to be the year 2003. Then
P0 = 12,000.

Next we need to find d. Remember d is the growth per time period, in this case growth per
year. Between the two measurements, the population grew by 15,000-12,000 = 3,000, but it
took 2007-2003 = 4 years to grow that much. To find the growth per year, we can divide:
3000 elk / 4 years = 750 elk in 1 year.

Alternatively, you can use the slope formula from algebra to determine the common
difference, noting that the population is the output of the formula, and time is the input.

d = slope = change in output = 15,000 -12,000 = 3000 = 750
change in input 2007 - 2003          4

We can now write our equation in whichever form is preferred.

Recursive form:
P0 = 12,000
Pn = Pn-1 + 750

Explicit form:
Pn = 12,000 + 750n

To answer the question, we need to first note that the year 2014 will be n = 11, since 2014 is
11 years after 2003. The explicit form will be easier to use for this calculation:

P11 = 12,000 + 750(11) = 20,250 elk

Example 2

     Gasoline consumption in the US has been increasing steadily. Consumption data from 1992
     to 2004 is shown below1. Find a model for this data, and use it to predict consumption in
     2016. If the trend continues, when will consumption reach 200 billion gallons?

Year             `92 `93 `94 `95 `96 `97 `98 `99 `00 `01 `02 `03 `04

Plotting this data, it appears to have an        Gas Consumption  140
approximately linear relationship:                                130
While there are more advanced statistical                         120                        1996        2000                               2004
techniques that can be used to find an equation                   110
to model the data, to get an idea of what is                      100
happening, we can find an equation by using
two pieces of the data - perhaps the data from                        1992
1993 and 2003.
                                                                                                   Year
Letting n = 0 correspond with 1993 would
give P0 = 111 billion gallons.

To find d, we need to know how much the gas consumption increased each year, on average.
From 1993 to 2003 the gas consumption increased from 111 billion gallons to 133 billion
gallons, a total change of 133 - 111 = 22 billion gallons, over 10 years. This gives us an
average change of 22 billion gallons / 10 year = 2.2 billion gallons per year.

Equivalently,

d = slope = change in output = 133 -111 = 22 = 2.2 billion gallons per year
               change in input 10 - 0 10

We can now write our equation in whichever form is preferred.

Recursive form:

P0 = 111

Pn = Pn-1 + 2.2                                                                    140

Explicit form:                                                    Gas Consumption  130

Pn = 111 + 2.2n

                                                                                   120

Calculating values using the explicit form and                                     110
plotting them with the original data shows how
well our model fits the data.                                                      100
                                                                                       1992
                                                                                             1996        2000                               2004

                                                                                                                                      Year

                                                Growth Models 177

We can now use our model to make predictions about the future, assuming that the previous
trend continues unchanged. To predict the gasoline consumption in 2016:

n = 23 (2016 - 1993 = 23 years later)
P23 = 111 + 2.2(23) = 161.6

Our model predicts that the US will consume 161.6 billion gallons of gasoline in 2016 if the
current trend continues.

To find when the consumption will reach 200 billion gallons, we would set Pn = 200, and

solve for n:

Pn = 200          Replace Pn with our model

111 + 2.2n = 200  Subtract 111 from both sides

2.2n = 89         Divide both sides by 2.2

n = 40.4545

This tells us that consumption will reach 200 billion about 40 years after 1993, which would
be in the year 2033.

Example 3
     The cost, in dollars, of a gym membership for n months can be described by the explicit
     equation Pn = 70 + 30n. What does this equation tell us?

     The value for P0 in this equation is 70, so the initial starting cost is $70. This tells us that
     there must be an initiation or start-up fee of $70 to join the gym.

     The value for d in the equation is 30, so the cost increases by $30 each month. This tells us
     that the monthly membership fee for the gym is $30 a month.

The number of stay-at-home fathers in Canada has been growing steadily2. While the trend
is not perfectly linear, it is fairly linear. Use the data from 1976 and 2010 to find an explicit
formula for the number of stay-at-home fathers, then use it to predict the number if 2020.

When good models go bad

When using mathematical models to predict future behavior, it is important to keep in mind
that very few trends will continue indefinitely.

Example 4
     Suppose a four year old boy is currently 39 inches tall, and you are told to expect him to
     grow 2.5 inches a year.

     We can set up a growth model, with n = 0 corresponding to 4 years old.

     Recursive form:
     P0 = 39
     Pn = Pn-1 + 2.5

     Explicit form:
     Pn = 39 + 2.5n

     So at 6 years old, we would expect him to be
     P2 = 39 + 2.5(2) = 44 inches tall

     Any mathematical model will break down eventually. Certainly, we shouldn't expect this
     boy to continue to grow at the same rate all his life. If he did, at age 50 he would be
     P46 = 39 + 2.5(46) = 154 inches tall = 12.8 feet tall!

     When using any mathematical model, we have to consider which inputs are reasonable to
     use. Whenever we extrapolate, or make predictions into the future, we are assuming the
     model will continue to be valid.

 Exponential (Geometric) Growth
     Suppose that every year, only 10% of the fish in a lake have surviving offspring. If there
     were 100 fish in the lake last year, there would now be 110 fish. If there were 1000 fish in
     the lake last year, there would now be 1100 fish. Absent any inhibiting factors, populations
     of people and animals tend to grow by a percent of the existing population each year.

     Suppose our lake began with 1000 fish, and 10% of the fish have surviving offspring each
     year. Since we start with 1000 fish, P0 = 1000. How do we calculate P1? The new
     population will be the old population, plus an additional 10%. Symbolically:

     P1 = P0 + 0.10P0

     Notice this could be condensed to a shorter form by factoring:

     P1 = P0 + 0.10P0 = 1P0 + 0.10P0 = (1+ 0.10)P0 = 1.10P0

     While 10% is the growth rate, 1.10 is the growth multiplier. Notice that 1.10 can be
     thought of as "the original 100% plus an additional 10%"

     For our fish population,
     P1 = 1.10(1000) = 1100
                                                                                   Growth Models 179

We could then calculate the population in later years:
P2 = 1.10P1 = 1.10(1100) = 1210
P3 = 1.10P2 = 1.10(1210) = 1331

Notice that in the first year, the population grew by 100 fish, in the second year, the
population grew by 110 fish, and in the third year the population grew by 121 fish.
While there is a constant percentage growth, the actual increase in number of fish is
increasing each year.

Graphing these values we see that this growth                   1800
doesn't quite appear linear.
                                                                1600
To get a better picture of how this percentage-
based growth affects things, we need an explicit          Fish  1400
form, so we can quickly calculate values further
out in the future.                                              1200

Like we did for the linear model, we will start                 1000
building from the recursive equation:
                                                                800
P1 = 1.10P0 = 1.10(1000)
P2 = 1.10P1 = 1.10(1.10(1000)) = 1.102(1000)                          0      1   2  3            4    5
P3 = 1.10P2 = 1.10(1.102(1000)) = 1.103(1000)
P4 = 1.10P3 = 1.10(1.103(1000)) = 1.104(1000)                                    Years from now

Observing a pattern, we can generalize the explicit form to be:
Pn = 1.10n(1000), or equivalently, Pn = 1000(1.10n)

From this, we can quickly calculate the number of fish                18000

in 10, 20, or 30 years:                                               15000

P10 = 1.1010(1000) = 2594                                       Fish  12000
P20 = 1.1020(1000) = 6727                                              9000
P30 = 1.1030(1000) = 17449                                             6000

Adding these values to our graph reveals a shape that is              3000       5 10 15 20 25 30
definitely not linear. If our fish population had been                                Years from now
growing linearly, by 100 fish each year, the population                    0
would have only reached 4000 in 30 years compared to                          0

almost 18000 with this percent-based growth, called exponential growth.

In exponential growth, the population grows proportional to the size of the population, so as
the population gets larger, the same percent growth will yield a larger numeric growth.

Exponential Growth
If a quantity starts at size P0 and grows by R% (written as a decimal, r) every time
period, then the quantity after n time periods can be determined using either of these
relations:

Recursive form:
Pn = (1+r) Pn-1

Explicit form:   or equivalently, Pn = P0 (1+r)n
Pn = (1+r)n P0

We call r the growth rate.
The term (1+r) is called the growth multiplier, or common ratio.

Example 5
     Between 2007 and 2008, Olympia, WA grew almost 3% to a population of 245 thousand
     people. If this growth rate was to continue, what would the population of Olympia be in
     2014?

     As we did before, we first need to define what year will correspond to n = 0. Since we know
     the population in 2008, it would make sense to have 2008 correspond to n = 0, so P0 =
     245,000. The year 2014 would then be n = 6.

     We know the growth rate is 3%, giving r = 0.03.

     Using the explicit form:
     P6 = (1+0.03)6 (245,000) = 1.19405(245,000) = 292,542.25

     The model predicts that in 2014, Olympia would have a population of about 293 thousand
     people.

Evaluating exponents on the calculator
To evaluate expressions like (1.03)6, it will be easier to use a calculator than multiply
1.03 by itself six times. Most scientific calculators have a button for exponents. It is
typically either labeled like:

           ^ , yx , or xy .

To evaluate 1.036 we'd type 1.03 ^ 6, or 1.03 yx 6. Try it out - you should get an
answer around 1.1940523.

India is the second most populous country in the world, with a population in 2008 of about
1.14 billion people. The population is growing by about 1.34% each year. If this trend
continues, what will India's population grow to by 2020?

Example 6
     A friend is using the equation Pn = 4600(1.072)n to predict the annual tuition at a local
     college. She says the formula is based on years after 2010. What does this equation tell us?

     In the equation, P0 = 4600, which is the starting value of the tuition when n = 0. This tells us
     that the tuition in 2010 was $4,600.

     The growth multiplier is 1.072, so the growth rate is 0.072, or 7.2%. This tells us that the
     tuition is expected to grow by 7.2% each year.

     Putting this together, we could say that the tuition in 2010 was $4,600, and is expected to
     grow by 7.2% each year.

Example 7

     In 1990, the residential energy use in the US was responsible for 962 million metric tons of
     carbon dioxide emissions. By the year 2000, that number had risen to 1182 million metric
     tons3. If the emissions grow exponentially and continue at the same rate, what will the
     emissions grow to by 2050?

Similar to before, we will correspond n = 0 with 1990, as that is the year for the first piece of
data we have. That will make P0 = 962 (million metric tons of CO2). In this problem, we are
not given the growth rate, but instead are given that P10 = 1182.

When n = 10, the explicit equation looks like:
P10 = (1+r)10 P0

We know the value for P0, so we can put that into the equation:
P10 = (1+r)10 962

We also know that P10 = 1182, so substituting that in, we get
1182 = (1+r)10 962

We can now solve this equation for the growth rate, r. Start by dividing by 962.

1182 = (1 + r)10  Take the 10th root of both sides
962

10 1182 = 1 + r   Subtract 1 from both sides
   962

3 http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/carbon.html
182

r = 10 1182 -1 = 0.0208 = 2.08%
        962

So if the emissions are growing exponentially, they are growing by about 2.08% per year.
We can now predict the emissions in 2050 by finding P60

P60 = (1+0.0208)60 962 = 3308.4 million metric tons of CO2 in 2050

   Rounding
   As a note on rounding, notice that if we had rounded the growth rate to 2.1%, our
   calculation for the emissions in 2050 would have been 3347. Rounding to 2% would
   have changed our result to 3156. A very small difference in the growth rates gets
   magnified greatly in exponential growth. For this reason, it is recommended to round
   the growth rate as little as possible.

   If you need to round, keep at least three significant digits - numbers after any leading
   zeros. So 0.4162 could be reasonably rounded to 0.416. A growth rate of 0.001027
   could be reasonably rounded to 0.00103.

   Evaluating roots on the calculator
   In the previous example, we had to calculate the 10th root of a number. This is
   different than taking the basic square root, . Many scientific calculators have a button
   for general roots. It is typically labeled like:

               n , x , or y x

   To evaluate the 3rd root of 8, for example, we'd either type 3 x 8, or 8 x 3,
   depending on the calculator. Try it on yours to see which to use - you should get an
   answer of 2.

   If your calculator does not have a general root button, all is not lost. You can instead
   use the property of exponents which states that n a = a1/ n . So, to compute the 3rd root
   of 8, you could use your calculator's exponent key to evaluate 81/ 3 . To do this, type:
    8 yx ( 1 ÷ 3 )

   The parentheses tell the calculator to divide 1/3 before doing the exponent.

Example 8
     Looking back at the last example, for the sake of comparison, what would the carbon
     emissions be in 2050 if emissions grow linearly at the same rate?

Again we will get n = 0 correspond with 1990, giving P0 = 962. To find d, we could take the
same approach as earlier, noting that the emissions increased by 220 million metric tons in 10
years, giving a common difference of 22 million metric tons each year.

Alternatively, we could use an approach similar to that which we used to find the exponential
equation. When n = 10, the explicit linear equation looks like:
P10 = P0 + 10d

We know the value for P0, so we can put that into the equation:
P10 = 962 + 10d

Since we know that P10 = 1182, substituting that in we get
1182 = 962 + 10d

We can now solve this equation for the common difference, d.

1182 - 962 = 10d

220 = 10d

d = 22

This tells us that if the emissions are changing

linearly, they are growing by 22 million metric 3500
tons each year. Predicting the emissions in 2050,  Emissions (Millions Metric
                                                      Tons)                    3000

values helps illustrate the differences.                                        500
                                                                                    0

So how do we know which growth model to use
when working with data? There are two approaches which should be used together whenever
possible:

1) Find more than two pieces of data. Plot the values, and look for a trend. Does the
    data appear to be changing like a line, or do the values appear to be curving upwards?

2) Consider the factors contributing to the data. Are they things you would expect to
    change linearly or exponentially? For example, in the case of carbon emissions, we
    could expect that, absent other factors, they would be tied closely to population
    values, which tend to change exponentially.
184

Solving Exponentials for Time: Logarithms
   Earlier, we found that since Olympia, WA had a population of 245 thousand in 2008 and had
   been growing at 3% per year, the population could be modeled by the equation

Pn = (1+0.03)n (245,000), or equivalently, Pn = 245,000(1.03)n.

Using this equation, we were able to predict the population in the future.

Suppose we wanted to know when the population of Olympia would reach 400 thousand.
Since we are looking for the year n when the population will be 400 thousand, we would
need to solve the equation

400,000 = 245,000(1.03)n  dividing both sides by 245,000 gives
1.6327 = 1.03n

One approach to this problem would be to create a table of values, or to use technology to
draw a graph to estimate the solution.

From the graph, we can estimate that the solution will be around 16 to 17 years after 2008
(2024 to 2025). This is pretty good, but we'd really like to have an algebraic tool to answer
this question. To do that, we need to introduce a new function that will undo exponentials,
similar to how a square root undoes a square. For exponentials, the function we need is
called a logarithm. It is the inverse of the exponential, meaning it undoes the exponential.
While there is a whole family of logarithms with different bases, we will focus on the
common log, which is based on the exponential 10x.

   Common Logarithm
   The common logarithm, written log(x), undoes the exponential 10x
   This means that log(10x) = x, and likewise 10log(x) = x
   This also means the statement 10a = b is equivalent to the statement log(b) = a

   log(x) is read as "log of x", and means "the logarithm of the value x". It is important to
   note that this is not multiplication - the log doesn't mean anything by itself, just like 
   doesn't mean anything by itself; it has to be applied to a number.

Example 9

Evaluate each of the following

a) log(100)  b) log(1000)          c) log(10000)            d) log(1/100)        e) log(1)

a) log(100) can be written as log(102). Since the log undoes the exponential, log(102) = 2
b) log(1000) = log(103) = 3
c) log(10000) = log(104) = 4

             -n 1            1
d) Recall that x = n . log  = log(10 ) = -2   -2

                          x  100 

e) Recall that x0 = 1. log(1) = log(100) = 0

     It is helpful to note that from the first three parts of the previous example that the number
     we're taking the log of has to get 10 times bigger for the log to increase in value by 1.
     Of course, most numbers cannot be written as a nice simple power of 10. For those numbers,
     we can evaluate the log using a scientific calculator with a log button.

Example 10
     Evaluate log(300)

     Using a calculator, log(300) is approximately 2.477121

With an equation, just like we can add a number to both sides, multiply both sides by a
number, or square both sides, we can also take the logarithm of both sides of the equation
and end up with an equivalent equation. This will allow us to solve some simple equations.

Example 11                   b) Solve 10x = 3               c) Solve 2(10x) = 8
     a) Solve 10x = 1000

a) Taking the log of both sides gives log(10x) = log(1000)

Since the log undoes the exponential, log(10x) = x. Similarly log(1000) = log(103) = 3.
The equation simplifies then to x = 3.

b) Taking the log of both sides gives log(10x) = log(3).

On the left side, log(10x) = x, so x = log(3). We can approximate this value with a calculator.
x  0.477

c) Here we would first want to isolate the exponential by dividing both sides of the equation

by 2, giving
10x = 4.

Now we can take the log of both sides, giving log(10x) = log(4), which simplifies to
x = log(4)  0.602
186

This approach allows us to solve exponential equations with powers of 10, but what about
problems like 2 = 1.03n from earlier, which have a base of 1.03? For that, we need the
exponent property for logs.

   Properties of Logs: Exponent Property

  log(Ar ) = r log(A)

To show why this is true, we offer a proof.
Since the logarithm and exponential undo each other, 10log A = A.

So Ar = (10log A )r
Utilizing the exponential rule that states (xa )b = xab ,
Ar = (10log A )r = 10r log A

So then log(Ar ) = log(10r log A )

Again utilizing the property that the log undoes the exponential on the right side yields the
result

log(Ar ) = r log A

Example 12
     Rewrite log(25) using the exponent property for logs

     log(25) = log(52) = 2log(5)

     This property will finally allow us to answer our original question.

Solving exponential equations with logarithms
1. Isolate the exponential. In other words, get it by itself on one side of the equation.

    This usually involves dividing by a number multiplying it.
2. Take the log of both sides of the equation.
3. Use the exponent property of logs to rewrite the exponential with the variable

    exponent multiplying the logarithm.
4. Divide as needed to solve for the variable.

Example 13
     If Olympia is growing according to the equation, Pn = 245(1.03)n, where n is years after
     2008, and the population is measured in thousands. Find when the population will be 400
     thousand.

We need to solve the equation

400 = 245(1.03)n  Begin by dividing both sides by 245 to isolate the exponential
1.633 = 1.03n                                                             Growth Models 187
log(1.633) = log(1.03n)
log(1.633)= n log(1.03)     Now take the log of both sides
                            Use the exponent property of logs on the right side
log(1.633) = n              Now we can divide by log(1.03)
 log(1.03)                  We can approximate this value on a calculator

n  16.591

Alternatively, after applying the exponent property of logs on the right side, we could have
evaluated the logarithms to decimal approximations and completed our calculations using
those approximations, as you'll see in the next example. While the final answer may come
out slightly differently, as long as we keep enough significant values during calculation, our
answer will be close enough for most purposes.

Example 14

     Polluted water is passed through a series of filters. Each filter removes 90% of the remaining
     impurities from the water. If you have 10 million particles of pollutant per gallon originally,
     how many filters would the water need to be passed through to reduce the pollutant to 500
     particles per gallon?

In this problem, our "population" is the number of particles of pollutant per gallon. The
initial pollutant is 10 million particles per gallon, so P0 = 10,000,000. Instead of changing
with time, the pollutant changes with the number of filters, so n will represent the number of
filters the water passes through.

Also, since the amount of pollutant is decreasing with each filter instead of increasing, our
"growth" rate will be negative, indicating that the population is decreasing instead of
increasing, so r = -0.90.

We can then write the explicit equation for the pollutant:
Pn = 10,000,000(1 - 0.90)n = 10,000,000(0.10)n

To solve the question of how many filters are needed to lower the pollutant to 500 particles
per gallon, we can set Pn equal to 500, and solve for n.

500 = 10,000,000(0.10)n              Divide both sides by 10,000,000
0.00005 = 0.10n                      Take the log of both sides
log(0.00005) = log(0.10n)            Use the exponent property of logs on the right side
                                     Evaluate the logarithms to a decimal approximation

India had a population in 2008 of about 1.14 billion people. The population is growing by
about 1.34% each year. If this trend continues, when will India's population reach 1.2
billion?

Logistic Growth
   In our basic exponential growth scenario, we had a recursive equation of the form
   Pn = Pn-1 + r Pn-1

   In a confined environment, however, the growth rate may not remain constant. In a lake, for
   example, there is some maximum sustainable population of fish, also called a carrying
   capacity.

Carrying Capacity
The carrying capacity, or maximum sustainable population, is the largest
population that an environment can support.

For our fish, the carrying capacity is the largest population that the resources in the lake can
sustain. If the population in the lake is far below the carrying capacity, then we would expect
the population to grow essentially exponentially. However, as the population approaches the
carrying capacity, there will be a scarcity of food and space available, and the growth rate
will decrease. If the population exceeds the carrying capacity, there won't be enough
resources to sustain all the fish and there will be a negative growth rate, causing the
population to decrease back to the carrying capacity.

If the carrying capacity was 5000, the growth rate                0.1

might vary something like that in the graph

shown. Note that this is a linear equation with      Growth Rate

intercept at 0.1 and slope - 0.1 , so we could 0
                         5000
                                                                       0   5000                      10000
write an equation for this adjusted growth rate as:

                   0.1    P                                       -0.1
radjusted = 0.1 -        P = 0.11 -                                                      Population
                   5000   5000 

Substituting this in to our original exponential growth model for r gives

 Pn-1 
Pn = Pn-1 + 0.11 -        Pn -1

Logistic Growth
If a population is growing in a constrained environment with carrying capacity K, and
absent constraint would grow exponentially with growth rate r, then the population
behavior can be described by the logistic growth model:

                Pn-1 
Pn = Pn-1 + r1 - Pn-1

                K

Unlike linear and exponential growth, logistic growth behaves differently if the populations
grow steadily throughout the year or if they have one breeding time per year. The recursive
formula provided above models generational growth, where there is one breeding time per
year (or, at least a finite number); there is no explicit formula for this type of logistic growth.

Example 15
     A forest is currently home to a population of 200 rabbits. The forest is estimated to be able
     to sustain a population of 2000 rabbits. Absent any restrictions, the rabbits would grow by
     50% per year. Predict the future population using the logistic growth model.

     Modeling this with a logistic growth model, r = 0.50, K = 2000, and P0 = 200. Calculating
     the next year:

 P0                                   200 
P1 = P0 + 0.501 -  P0 = 200 + 0.501 -             200 = 290
 2000                                 2000 

We can use this to calculate the following year:

 P1                                   290 
P2 = P1 + 0.501 -  P1 = 290 + 0.501 -             290  414
 2000                                 2000 

A calculator was used to compute several more values:

n 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Pn 200 290 414 578 784 1022 1272 1503 1690 1821 1902

Plotting these values, we can see that the                    2000

population starts to increase faster and the 1500 Population
graph curves upwards during the first few

years, like exponential growth, but then the                  1000

Example 16

     On an island that can support a population of 1000 lizards, there is currently a population of
     600. These lizards have a lot of offspring and not a lot of natural predators, so have very
     high growth rate, around 150%. Calculating out the next couple generations:

            P0      600 
P1 = P0 + 1.501 - P0 = 600 + 1.501 - 600 = 960
            1000    1000 

            P1      960 
P2 = P1 + 1.501 - P1 = 960 + 1.501 - 960 = 1018
            1000    1000 

Interestingly, even though the factor that limits the growth rate slowed the growth a lot, the
population still overshot the carrying capacity. We would expect the population to decline
the next year.

            P3      1018 
P3 = P2 + 1.501 - P3 = 1018 + 1.501 - 1018 = 991
            1000    1000 

                                                                        1200

Calculating out a few more years and plotting the
results, we see the population wavers above and 800

below the carrying capacity, but eventually settles                     600

down, leaving a steady population near the carrying                     400

A field currently contains 20 mint plants. Absent constraints, the number of plants would
increase by 70% each year, but the field can only support a maximum population of 300

While it would be tempting to treat this only as a strange side effect of mathematics, this has
actually been observed in nature. Researchers from the University of California observed a
stable 2-cycle in a lizard population in California4.

Taking this even further, we get more and more extreme behaviors as the growth rate
increases higher. It is possible to get stable 4-cycles, 8-cycles, and higher. Quickly, though,
the behavior approaches chaos (remember the movie Jurassic Park?).

1. Letting n = 0 correspond with 1976, then P0 = 20,610.
From 1976 to 2010 the number of stay-at-home fathers increased by
53,555 - 20,610 = 32,945
This happened over 34 years, giving a common different d of 32,945 / 34 = 969.
Pn = 20,610 + 969n

Predicting for 2020, we use n = 44
P44 = 20,610 + 969(44) = 63,246 stay-at-home fathers in 2020.

    15. In 1968, the U.S. minimum wage was $1.60 per hour. In 1976, the minimum wage
         was $2.30 per hour. Assume the minimum wage grows according to an exponential
         model where n represents the time in years after 1960.
             a. Find an explicit formula for the minimum wage.

    16. The population of a small town can be described by the equation Pn = 4000 + 70n,
         where n is the number of years after 2005. Explain in words what this equation tells
         us about how the population is changing.

    17. The population of a small town can be described by the equation Pn = 4000(1.04)n,
         where n is the number of years after 2005. Explain in words what this equation tells
         us about how the population is changing.

Exploration
Most of the examples in the text examined growing quantities, but linear and exponential
equations can also describe decreasing quantities, as the next few problems will explore.

    18. A new truck costs $32,000. The car's value will depreciate over time, which means it
         will lose value. For tax purposes, depreciation is usually calculated linearly. If the
         truck is worth $24,500 after three years, write an explicit formula for the value of the
         car after n years.

    19. Inflation causes things to cost more, and for our money to buy less (hence your
         grandparents saying, "In my day, you could buy a cup of coffee for a nickel").
         Suppose inflation decreases the value of money by 5% each year. In other words, if
         you have $1 this year, next year it will only buy you $0.95 worth of stuff. How much
         will $100 buy you in 20 years?

    20. Suppose that you have a bowl of 500 M&M candies, and each day you eat ¼ of the
         candies you have. Is the number of candies left changing linearly or exponentially?
         Write an equation to model the number of candies left after n days.

    21. A warm object in a cooler room will decrease in temperature exponentially,
         approaching the room temperature according to the formula Tn = a(1- r)n + Tr where
         Tn is the temperature after n minutes, r is the rate at which temperature is changing, a
         is a constant, and Tr is the temperature of the room. Forensic investigators can use
         this to predict the time of death of a homicide victim. Suppose that when a body was
         discovered (n = 0) it was 85 degrees. After 20 minutes, the temperature was
         measured again to be 80 degrees. The body was in a 70 degree room.
             a. Use the given information with the formula provided to find a formula for the
                  temperature of the body.
             b. When did the victim die, if the body started at 98.6 degrees?

22. Recursive equations can be very handy for modeling complicated situations for which
    explicit equations would be hard to interpret. As an example, consider a lake in
    which 2000 fish currently reside. The fish population grows by 10% each year, but
    every year 100 fish are harvested from the lake by people fishing.
         a. Write a recursive equation for the number of fish in the lake after n years.
         b. Calculate the population after 1 and 2 years. Does the population appear to be
             increasing or decreasing?
         c. What is the maximum number of fish that could be harvested each year
             without causing the fish population to decrease in the long run?

     23. The number of Starbucks stores grew after first opened. The number of stores from
         1990-2007, as reported on their corporate website5, is shown below.
              a. Carefully plot the data. Does is appear to be changing linearly or
                  exponentially?
              b. Try finding an equation to model the data by picking two points to work from.
                  How well does the equation model the data?
              c. Try using an equation of the form Pn = P0nk , where k is a constant, to model

                  the data. This type of model is called a Power model. Compare your results
                  to the results from part b. Note: to use this model, you will need to have 1990
                  correspond with n = 1 rather than n = 0.

24. Thomas Malthus was an economist who put forth the principle that population grows
    based on an exponential growth model, while food and resources grow based on a
    linear growth model. Based on this, Malthus predicted that eventually demand for
    food and resources would out outgrow supply, with doom-and-gloom consequences.
    Do some research about Malthus to answer these questions.
         a. What societal changes did Malthus propose to avoid the doom-and-gloom
             outcome he was predicting?
         b. Why do you think his predictions did not occur?
         c. What are the similarities and differences between Malthus's theory and the
             logistic growth model?

Finance

     We have to work with money every day. While balancing your checkbook or calculating
     your monthly expenditures on espresso requires only arithmetic, when we start saving,
     planning for retirement, or need a loan, we need more mathematics.

 Simple Interest
     Discussing interest starts with the principal, or amount your account starts with. This could
     be a starting investment, or the starting amount of a loan. Interest, in its most simple form, is
     calculated as a percent of the principal. For example, if you borrowed $100 from a friend
     and agree to repay it with 5% interest, then the amount of interest you would pay would just
     be 5% of 100: $100(0.05) = $5. The total amount you would repay would be $105, the
     original principal plus the interest.

Simple One-time Interest
I = P0r
A = P0 + I = P0 + P0r = P0 (1+ r)

I is the interest
A is the end amount: principal plus interest
P0 is the principal (starting amount)
r is the interest rate (in decimal form. Example: 5% = 0.05)

Example 1
     A friend asks to borrow $300 and agrees to repay it in 30 days with 3% interest. How much
     interest will you earn?

P0 = $300        the principal

r = 0.03         3% rate

I = $300(0.03) = $9. You will earn $9 interest.

One-time simple interest is only common for extremely short-term loans. For longer term
loans, it is common for interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. In
that case, interest would be earned regularly. For example, bonds are essentially a loan made
to the bond issuer (a company or government) by you, the bond holder. In return for the
loan, the issuer agrees to pay interest, often annually. Bonds have a maturity date, at which
time the issuer pays back the original bond value.

Example 2

     Suppose your city is building a new park, and issues bonds to raise the money to build it.
     You obtain a $1,000 bond that pays 5% interest annually that matures in 5 years. How much
     interest will you earn?

198

Each year, you would earn 5% interest: $1000(0.05) = $50 in interest. So over the course of
five years, you would earn a total of $250 in interest. When the bond matures, you would
receive back the $1,000 you originally paid, leaving you with a total of $1,250.

We can generalize this idea of simple interest over time.

   Simple Interest over Time
    I = P0rt
    A = P0 + I = P0 + P0rt = P0 (1 + rt)

   I is the interest
   A is the end amount: principal plus interest
   P0 is the principal (starting amount)
   r is the interest rate in decimal form
   t is time

   The units of measurement (years, months, etc.) for the time should match the time
   period for the interest rate.

   APR - Annual Percentage Rate
   Interest rates are usually given as an annual percentage rate (APR) - the total interest
   that will be paid in the year. If the interest is paid in smaller time increments, the APR
   will be divided up.

   For example, a 6% APR paid monthly would be divided into twelve 0.5% payments.
   A 4% annual rate paid quarterly would be divided into four 1% payments.

Example 3

     Treasury Notes (T-notes) are bonds issued by the federal government to cover its expenses.
     Suppose you obtain a $1,000 T-note with a 4% annual rate, paid semi-annually, with a
     maturity in 4 years. How much interest will you earn?

Since interest is being paid semi-annually (twice a year), the 4% interest will be divided into
two 2% payments.

P0 = $1000  the principal

r = 0.02    2% rate per half-year

t = 8       4 years = 8 half-years

I = $1000(0.02)(8) = $160. You will earn $160 interest total over the four years.

Compound Interest
   With simple interest, we were assuming that we pocketed the interest when we received it.
   In a standard bank account, any interest we earn is automatically added to our balance, and
   we earn interest on that interest in future years. This reinvestment of interest is called
   compounding.

Suppose that we deposit $1000 in a bank account offering 3% interest, compounded monthly.
How will our money grow?

The 3% interest is an annual percentage rate (APR) - the total interest to be paid during the
year. Since interest is being paid monthly, each month, we will earn 3% = 0.25% per month.

                                                                                    12

In the first month,
P0 = $1000
r = 0.0025 (0.25%)
I = $1000 (0.0025) = $2.50
A = $1000 + $2.50 = $1002.50

In the first month, we will earn $2.50 in interest, raising our account balance to $1002.50.
In the second month,

P0 = $1002.50
I = $1002.50 (0.0025) = $2.51 (rounded)
A = $1002.50 + $2.51 = $1005.01

Notice that in the second month we earned more interest than we did in the first month. This
is because we earned interest not only on the original $1000 we deposited, but we also earned
interest on the $2.50 of interest we earned the first month. This is the key advantage that
compounding of interest gives us.

To find an equation to represent this, if Pm represents the amount of money after m months,
then we could write the recursive equation:

P0 = $1000
Pm = (1+0.0025)Pm-1

You probably recognize this as the recursive form of exponential growth.  If not, we could go

through the steps to build an explicit equation for the growth:

P0 = $1000

P1 = 1.0025P0 = 1.0025 (1000)
P2 = 1.0025P1 = 1.0025 (1.0025 (1000)) = 1.0025 2(1000)
P3 = 1.0025P2 = 1.0025 (1.00252(1000)) = 1.00253(1000)
P4 = 1.0025P3 = 1.0025 (1.00253(1000)) = 1.00254(1000)

Observing a pattern, we could conclude

Pm = (1.0025)m($1000)

Notice that the $1000 in the equation was P0, the starting amount. We found 1.0025 by
adding one to the growth rate divided by 12, since we were compounding 12 times per year.
Generalizing our result, we could write

           r m
= Pm P0 1+ 

           k

In this formula:
m is the number of compounding periods (months in our example)
r is the annual interest rate
k is the number of compounds per year.

While this formula works fine, it is more common to use a formula that involves the number
of years, rather than the number of compounding periods. If N is the number of years, then
m = N k. Making this change gives us the standard formula for compound interest.

   Compound Interest
              r Nk

    PN = P0 1 + 
              k

   PN is the balance in the account after N years.
   P0 is the starting balance of the account (also called initial deposit, or principal)
   r is the annual interest rate in decimal form
   k is the number of compounding periods in one year.

If the compounding is done annually (once a year), k = 1.
If the compounding is done quarterly, k = 4.
If the compounding is done monthly, k = 12.
If the compounding is done daily, k = 365.
                                                                                            Finance 201

The most important thing to remember about using this formula is that it assumes that we put
money in the account once and let it sit there earning interest.

Example 4

     A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings instrument that many banks offer. It usually gives a
     higher interest rate, but you cannot access your investment for a specified length of time.
     Suppose you deposit $3000 in a CD paying 6% interest, compounded monthly. How much
     will you have in the account after 20 years?

In this example,

P0 = $3000        the initial deposit

r = 0.06          6% annual rate

k = 12      12 months in 1 year

N = 20      since we're looking for how much we'll have after 20 years

                  0.06 20×12
So P20 =30001+  =$9930.61 (round your answer to the nearest penny)

                  12 

Let us compare the amount of money earned from compounding against the amount you
would earn from simple interest

As you can see, over a long period of time, compounding makes a large difference in the
account balance. You may recognize this as the difference between linear growth and
exponential growth.

   Evaluating exponents on the calculator
   When we need to calculate something like 53 it is easy enough to just multiply
   555=125. But when we need to calculate something like 1.005240 , it would be very
   tedious to calculate this by multiplying 1.005 by itself 240 times! So to make things
   easier, we can harness the power of our scientific calculators.

   Most scientific calculators have a button for exponents. It is typically either labeled
   like:

               ^ , yx , or xy .

   To evaluate 1.005240 we'd type 1.005 ^ 240, or 1.005 yx 240. Try it out - you should
   get something around 3.3102044758.

Example 5

     You know that you will need $40,000 for your child's education in 18 years. If your account
     earns 4% compounded quarterly, how much would you need to deposit now to reach your
     goal?

In this example,

We're looking for P0.

r = 0.04               4%

k = 4                  4 quarters in 1 year

N = 18    Since we know the balance in 18 years

P18 = $40,000 The amount we have in 18 years

    In this case, we're going to have to set up the equation, and solve for P0.

                   4

    40000 = P0 (2.0471)

           40000
= P0 = $19539.84

          2.0471

So you would need to deposit $19,539.84 now to have $40,000 in 18 years.

Rounding
It is important to be very careful about rounding when calculating things with
exponents. In general, you want to keep as many decimals during calculations as you
can. Be sure to keep at least 3 significant digits (numbers after any leading zeros).
Rounding 0.00012345 to 0.000123 will usually give you a "close enough" answer, but
keeping more digits is always better.
                                                                            Finance 203

Example 6
     To see why not over-rounding is so important, suppose you were investing $1000 at 5%
     interest compounded monthly for 30 years.

P0 = $1000       the initial deposit

r = 0.05         5%

k = 12           12 months in 1 year

N = 30           since we're looking for the amount after 30 years

If we first compute r/k, we find 0.05/12 = 0.00416666666667

Here is the effect of rounding this to different values:

r/k rounded to:            Gives P30 to be:                  Error
0.004
0.0042                     $4208.59                          $259.15
0.00417                    $4521.45                          $53.71
0.004167                   $4473.09                          $5.35
0.0041667                  $4468.28                          $0.54
no rounding                $4467.80                          $0.06
                           $4467.74

If you're working in a bank, of course you wouldn't round at all. For our purposes, the
answer we got by rounding to 0.00417, three significant digits, is close enough - $5 off of
$4500 isn't too bad. Certainly keeping that fourth decimal place wouldn't have hurt.

Using your calculator
In many cases, you can avoid rounding completely by how you enter things in your
calculator. For example, in the example above, we needed to calculate

              0.05 12×30
P30 = 10001 + 

              12 

                                                                       0.05 360
We can quickly calculate 12×30 = 360, giving P30 = 10001 +  .

                                                                       12 
Now we can use the calculator.

       Using your calculator continued
       The previous steps were assuming you have a "one operation at a time" calculator; a
       more advanced calculator will often allow you to type in the entire expression to be
       evaluated. If you have a calculator like this, you will probably just need to enter:

       1000 × ( 1 + 0.05 ÷ 12 ) yx 360 = .

Annuities
   For most of us, we aren't able to put a large sum of money in the bank today. Instead, we
   save for the future by depositing a smaller amount of money from each paycheck into the
   bank. This idea is called a savings annuity. Most retirement plans like 401k plans or IRA
   plans are examples of savings annuities.

   An annuity can be described recursively in a fairly simple way. Recall that basic compound
   interest follows from the relationship

           r
    Pm= 1+  Pm-1

           k

   For a savings annuity, we simply need to add a deposit, d, to the account with each
   compounding period:

           r
    Pm = 1+  Pm-1 + d

           k

   Taking this equation from recursive form to explicit form is a bit trickier than with
   compound interest. It will be easiest to see by working with an example rather than working
   in general.

   Suppose we will deposit $100 each month into an account paying 6% interest. We assume
   that the account is compounded with the same frequency as we make deposits unless stated
   otherwise. In this example:
   r = 0.06 (6%)
   k = 12 (12 compounds/deposits per year)
   d = $100 (our deposit per month)

   Writing out the recursive equation gives
           0.06 

   Pm =1+  Pm-1 +100 =(1.005) Pm-1 +100

           12 

   Assuming we start with an empty account, we can begin using this relationship:
                                                                                    Finance 205

  P0 = 0                        100

=P1 (1.005) P0 += 100           (1.005)(100) += 100 100(1.005) +100
= P2 (1.005) P1 += 100
                                (1.005)(100(1.005) +100) += 100 100(1.005)2 +100(1.005) +100
= P3 (1.005) P2 += 100

        Continuing this pattern, after m deposits, we'd have saved:

= Pm 100(1.005)m-1 +100(1.005)m-2 + +100(1.005) +100

         In other words, after m months, the first deposit will have earned compound interest for m-1
         months. The second deposit will have earned interest for m-2 months. Last months deposit
         would have earned only one month worth of interest. The most recent deposit will have
         earned no interest yet.

         This equation leaves a lot to be desired, though - it doesn't make calculating the ending
         balance any easier! To simplify things, multiply both sides of the equation by 1.005:

= 1.005Pm 1.005(100(1.005)m-1 +100(1.005)m-2 + +100(1.005) +100)

Distributing on the right side of the equation gives

= 1.005Pm 100(1.005)m +100(1.005)m-1 + +100(1.005)2 +100(1.005)

Now we'll line this up with like terms from our original equation, and subtract each side

                     = 1.005Pm  100(1.005)m +  100(1.005)m-1 + +  100(1.005)
= Pm                                           100(1.005)m-1 + +  100(1.005)
                                                                              +100

Almost all the terms cancel on the right hand side when we subtract, leaving

1.005= Pm - Pm 100(1.005)m -100

    Solving for Pm

= 0.005Pm 100((1.005)m -1)
     100((1.005)m -1)

     Pm = 0.005

    Replacing m months with 12N, where N is measured in years, gives
206

   100((1.005)12N -1)

PN = 0.005
Recall 0.005 was r/k and 100 was the deposit d. 12 was k, the number of deposit each year.
Generalizing this result, we get the saving annuity formula.

Annuity Formula

       r Nk

       k         
PN =

      k

PN is the balance in the account after N years.
d is the regular deposit (the amount you deposit each year, each month, etc.)
r is the annual interest rate in decimal form.
k is the number of compounding periods in one year.

If the compounding frequency is not explicitly stated, assume there are the same
number of compounds in a year as there are deposits made in a year.

For example, if the compounding frequency isn't stated:
If you make your deposits every month, use monthly compounding, k = 12.
If you make your deposits every year, use yearly compounding, k = 1.
If you make your deposits every quarter, use quarterly compounding, k = 4.
Etc.

When do you use this
Annuities assume that you put money in the account on a regular schedule (every
month, year, quarter, etc.) and let it sit there earning interest.

Compound interest assumes that you put money in the account once and let it sit there
earning interest.

Compound interest: One deposit
Annuity: Many deposits.

Example 7

     A traditional individual retirement account (IRA) is a special type of retirement account in
     which the money you invest is exempt from income taxes until you withdraw it. If you
     deposit $100 each month into an IRA earning 6% interest, how much will you have in the
     account after 20 years?

In this example,

d = $100 the monthly deposit

r = 0.06  6% annual rate

k = 12    since we're doing monthly deposits, we'll compound monthly

N = 20    we want the amount after 20 years

Putting this into the equation:

            0.06 20(12) 
       100 1+  -1
            12             
P20 =

           12 

   100((1.005)240 -1)

P20 = (0.005)

P20 = 100(3.310 -1)
        (0.005)

            100 ( 2.310 )

= P20 = $46200

              (0.005)

The account will grow to $46,200 after 20 years.

Notice that you deposited into the account a total of $24,000 ($100 a month for 240 months).
The difference between what you end up with and how much you put in is the interest
earned. In this case it is $46,200 - $24,000 = $22,200.

Example 8

     You want to have $200,000 in your account when you retire in 30 years. Your retirement
     account earns 8% interest. How much do you need to deposit each month to meet your
     retirement goal?

In this example,      8% annual rate
We're looking for d.  since we're depositing monthly
r = 0.08              30 years
k = 12                The amount we want to have in 30 years
N = 30
P30 = $200,000
208

In this case, we're going to have to set up the equation, and solve for d.

              0.08 30(12) 
            d  1+  -1
              12            
200, 000 =
             0.08 
            
             12 

       d ((1.00667)360 -1)

200, 000 = (0.00667)

200, 000 = d (1491.57)

            200, 000
=d = $134.09

            1491.57

So you would need to deposit $134.09 each month to have $200,000 in 30 years if your
account earns 8% interest

Payout Annuities
   In the last section you learned about annuities. In an annuity, you start with nothing, put
   money into an account on a regular basis, and end up with money in your account.

   In this section, we will learn about a variation called a Payout Annuity. With a payout
   annuity, you start with money in the account, and pull money out of the account on a regular
   basis. Any remaining money in the account earns interest. After a fixed amount of time, the
   account will end up empty.

   Payout annuities are typically used after retirement. Perhaps you have saved $500,000 for
   retirement, and want to take money out of the account each month to live on. You want the
   money to last you 20 years. This is a payout annuity. The formula is derived in a similar
   way as we did for savings annuities. The details are omitted here.

P0 is the balance in the account at the beginning (starting amount, or principal).

r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form. Example: 5% = 0.05)
k is the number of compounding periods in one year.
N is the number of years we plan to take withdrawals

Like with annuities, the compounding frequency is not always explicitly given, but is
determined by how often you take the withdrawals.

When do you use this
Payout annuities assume that you take money from the account on a regular schedule
(every month, year, quarter, etc.) and let the rest sit there earning interest.

Compound interest: One deposit

Example 9

     After retiring, you want to be able to take $1000 every month for a total of 20 years from
     your retirement account. The account earns 6% interest. How much will you need in your
     account when you retire?

In this example,     the monthly withdrawal
d = $1000            6% annual rate
r = 0.06             since we're doing monthly withdrawals, we'll compound monthly
k = 12               since were taking withdrawals for 20 years
N = 20

We're looking for P0; how much money needs to be in the account at the beginning.
Putting this into the equation:

    1000× (1- 0.302)

P0 = $139, 600

        (0.005)

You will need to have $139,600 in your account when you retire.

Notice that you withdrew a total of $240,000 ($1000 a month for 240 months). The
difference between what you pulled out and what you started with is the interest earned. In
this case it is $240,000 - $139,600 = $100,400 in interest.

Evaluating negative exponents on your calculator
With these problems, you need to raise numbers to negative powers. Most calculators
have a separate button for negating a number that is different than the subtraction
button. Some calculators label this (-) , some with +/- . The button is often near the
= key or the decimal point.

If your calculator displays operations on it (typically a calculator with multiline
display), to calculate 1.005-240 you'd type something like: 1.005 ^ (-) 240

If your calculator only shows one value at a time, then usually you hit the (-) key after
a number to negate it, so you'd hit: 1.005 yx 240 (-) =

Give it a try - you should get 1.005-240 = 0.302096

     You know you will have $500,000 in your account when you retire. You want to be able to

     earns 8% interest. How much will you be able to withdraw each month?

We're looking for d.  since we're withdrawing monthly

Loans
   In the last section, you learned about payout annuities.

   In this section, you will learn about conventional loans (also called amortized loans or
   installment loans). Examples include auto loans and home mortgages. These techniques do
   not apply to payday loans, add-on loans, or other loan types where the interest is calculated
   up front.

   One great thing about loans is that they use exactly the same formula as a payout annuity. To
   see why, imagine that you had $10,000 invested at a bank, and started taking out payments
   while earning interest as part of a payout annuity, and after 5 years your balance was zero.
   Flip that around, and imagine that you are acting as the bank, and a car lender is acting as
   you. The car lender invests $10,000 in you. Since you're acting as the bank, you pay
   interest. The car lender takes payments until the balance is zero.

Like before, the compounding frequency is not always explicitly given, but is determined by
how often you make payments.

When do you use this
The loan formula assumes that you make loan payments on a regular schedule (every
month, year, quarter, etc.) and are paying interest on the loan.

Compound interest: One deposit
Annuity: Many deposits.

Example 11

     You can afford $200 per month as a car payment. If you can get an auto loan at 3% interest
     for 60 months (5 years), how expensive of a car can you afford? In other words, what
     amount loan can you pay off with $200 per month?

In this example,     the monthly loan payment
d = $200             3% annual rate
r = 0.03             since we're doing monthly payments, we'll compound monthly

                 (0.0025)

             You can afford a $11,120 loan.

             You will pay a total of $12,000 ($200 per month for 60 months) to the loan company. The
             difference between the amount you pay and the amount of the loan is the interest paid. In
             this case, you're paying $12,000-$11,120 = $880 interest total.

Example 12
     You want to take out a $140,000 mortgage (home loan). The interest rate on the loan is 6%,
     and the loan is for 30 years. How much will your monthly payments be?

In this example,

We're looking for d.

r = 0.06              6% annual rate

k = 12         since we're paying monthly

N = 30         30 years

P0 = $140,000         the starting loan amount

      In this case, we're going to have to set up the equation, and solve for d.
                        0.06 -30(12) 

                    d 1- 1+

     140, 000 = (0.005)

       140, 000 = d (166.792)
            140, 000

=d = $839.37
            166.792

You will make payments of $839.37 per month for 30 years.
214

You're paying a total of $302,173.20 to the loan company: $839.37 per month for 360
months. You are paying a total of $302,173.20 - $140,000 = $162,173.20 in interest over the
life of the loan.

Janine bought $3,000 of new furniture on credit. Because her credit score isn't very good,
the store is charging her a fairly high interest rate on the loan: 16%. If she agreed to pay off
the furniture over 2 years, how much will she have to pay each month?

Remaining Loan Balance
   With loans, it is often desirable to determine what the remaining loan balance will be after
   some number of years. For example, if you purchase a home and plan to sell it in five years,
   you might want to know how much of the loan balance you will have paid off and how much
   you have to pay from the sale.

   To determine the remaining loan balance after some number of years, we first need to know
   the loan payments, if we don't already know them. Remember that only a portion of your
   loan payments go towards the loan balance; a portion is going to go towards interest. For
   example, if your payments were $1,000 a month, after a year you will not have paid off
   $12,000 of the loan balance.

   To determine the remaining loan balance, we can think "how much loan will these loan
   payments be able to pay off in the remaining time on the loan?"

Example 13
     If a mortgage at a 6% interest rate has payments of $1,000 a month, how much will the loan
     balance be 10 years from the end the loan?

To determine this, we are looking for the amount of the loan that can be paid off by $1,000 a

month payments in 10 years. In other words, we're looking for P0 when

d = $1,000  the monthly loan payment

r = 0.06    6% annual rate

k = 12      since we're doing monthly payments, we'll compound monthly

N = 10      since we're making monthly payments for 10 more years
                                                                         Finance 215

P0 = (0.005)

                 1000(1- 0.5496)

= P0 = $90, 073.45

                     (0.005)

The loan balance with 10 years remaining on the loan will be $90,073.45

Often times answering remaining balance questions requires two steps:
1) Calculating the monthly payments on the loan
2) Calculating the remaining loan balance based on the remaining time on the loan

Example 14
     A couple purchases a home with a $180,000 mortgage at 4% for 30 years with monthly
     payments. What will the remaining balance on their mortgage be after 5 years?

First we will calculate their monthly payments.

We're looking for d.

r = 0.04               4% annual rate

k = 12         since they're paying monthly

N = 30         30 years

P0 = $180,000          the starting loan amount

       We set up the equation and solve for d.
                        0.04 -30(12) 

                    d 1- 1+  
                        12  

       180, 000 =
                              0.04 
                             
                              12 

          d (1- (1.00333)-360 )

     180, 000 = (0.00333)

       180, 000 = d (209.562)
            180, 000

=d = $858.93
            209.562
216

Now that we know the monthly payments, we can determine the remaining balance. We
want the remaining balance after 5 years, when 25 years will be remaining on the loan, so we
calculate the loan balance that will be paid off with the monthly payments over those 25
years.

d = $858.93      the monthly loan payment we calculated above
r = 0.04         4% annual rate
k = 12           since they're doing monthly payments
N = 25           since they'd be making monthly payments for 25 more years

               0.04 -25(12) 
      858.931- 1+  
                 12          
P0 =                         

                0.04 
               
                12 

  858.93(1- (1.00333)-300 )

P0 = (0.00333)

P0 858.93(1- 0.369)  $162, 758
       (0.00333)

The loan balance after 5 years, with 25 years remaining on the loan, will be $162,758

Over that 5 years, the couple has paid off $180,000 - $162,758 = $17,242 of the loan balance.
They have paid a total of $858.93 a month for 5 years (60 months), for a total of $51,535.80,
so $51,535.80 - $17,242 = $34,292.80 of what they have paid so far has been interest.

Which equation to use?
   When presented with a finance problem (on an exam or in real life), you're usually not told
   what type of problem it is or which equation to use. Here are some hints on deciding which
   equation to use based on the wording of the problem.

   The easiest types of problem to identify are loans. Loan problems almost always include
   words like: "loan", "amortize" (the fancy word for loans), "finance (a car)", or "mortgage" (a
   home loan). Look for these words. If they're there, you're probably looking at a loan
   problem. To make sure, see if you're given what your monthly (or annual) payment is, or if
   you're trying to find a monthly payment.

   If the problem is not a loan, the next question you want to ask is: "Am I putting money in an
   account and letting it sit, or am I making regular (monthly/annually/quarterly) payments or
   withdrawals?" If you're letting the money sit in the account with nothing but interest
   changing the balance, then you're looking at a compound interest problem. The exception
   would be bonds and other investments where the interest is not reinvested; in those cases
   you're looking at simple interest.
                                                                                                Finance 217

   If you're making regular payments or withdrawals, the next questions is: "Am I putting
   money into the account, or am I pulling money out?" If you're putting money into the
   account on a regular basis (monthly/annually/quarterly) then you're looking at a
   basic Annuity problem. Basic annuities are when you are saving money. Usually in an
   annuity problem, your account starts empty, and has money in the future.
   If you're pulling money out of the account on a regular basis, then you're looking at a Payout
   Annuity problem. Payout annuities are used for things like retirement income, where you
   start with money in your account, pull money out on a regular basis, and your account ends
   up empty in the future.

   Remember, the most important part of answering any kind of question, money or otherwise,
   is first to correctly identify what the question is really asking, and to determine what
   approach will best allow you to solve the problem.

   For each of the following scenarios, determine if it is a compound interest problem, a savings
   annuity problem, a payout annuity problem, or a loans problem. Then solve each problem.

         a. Marcy received an inheritance of $20,000, and invested it at 6% interest. She is

              quarter. How much can she take out each quarter if she has 3 years of school
              left?

         b. Paul wants to buy a new car. Rather than take out a loan, he decides to save
              $200 a month in an account earning 3% interest compounded monthly. How
              much will he have saved up after 3 years?

         c. Keisha is managing investments for a non-profit company. They want to invest
              some money in an account earning 5% interest compounded annually with the
              goal to have $30,000 in the account in 6 years. How much should Keisha
              deposit into the account?

         d. Miao is going to finance new office equipment at a 2% rate over a 4 year term.
              If she can afford monthly payments of $100, how much new equipment can she

         e. How much would you need to save every month in an account earning 4%
              interest to have $5,000 saved up in two years?

Solving for time
   Often we are interested in how long it will take to accumulate money or how long we'd need
   to extend a loan to bring payments down to a reasonable level.

   Note: This section assumes you've covered solving exponential equations using logarithms,
   either in prior classes or in the growth models chapter.
218

Example 15
     If you invest $2000 at 6% compounded monthly, how long will it take the account to double
     in value?

This is a compound interest problem, since we are depositing money once and allowing it to

grow. In this problem,

P0 = $2000  the initial deposit

r = 0.06    6% annual rate

k = 12      12 months in 1 year

                                             0.06 N×12
So our general equation= is PN 20001+  . We also know that we want our ending

                                             12 
amount to be double of $2000, which is $4000, so we're looking for N so that PN = 4000. To
solve this, we set our equation for PN equal to 4000.

                  0.06 N×12           Divide both sides by 2000
= 4000 20001+                To solve for the exponent, take the log of both sides

                  12                  Use the exponent property of logs on the right side
                                      Now we can divide both sides by 12log(1.005)
 2 = (1.005)12N                       Approximating this to a decimal

log (2) = log ((1.005)12N )

 log (2) = 12N log (1.005)
    log (2) = N

 12 log (1.005)

N = 11.581

It will take about 11.581 years for the account to double in value. Note that your answer may
come out slightly differently if you had evaluated the logs to decimals and rounded during
your calculations, but your answer should be close. For example if you rounded log(2) to
0.301 and log(1.005) to 0.00217, then your final answer would have been about 11.577 years.

Example 16
     If you invest $100 each month into an account earning 3% compounded monthly, how long
     will it take the account to grow to $10,000?

This is a savings annuity problem since we are making regular deposits into the account.

d = $100 the monthly deposit

r = 0.03    3% annual rate

k = 12      since we're doing monthly deposits, we'll compound monthly

We don't know N, but we want PN to be $10,000.
                                                                             Finance 219

Putting this into the equation:

             0.03 N (12) 
           100 1+  -1
             12                           
10, 000 =                                   Simplifying the fractions a bit
            0.03 
           
            12 

      100((1.0025)12N -1)

10, 000 =
                   0.0025

We want to isolate the exponential term, 1.002512N, so multiply both sides by 0.0025

= 25 100((1.0025)12N -1)                    Divide both sides by 100
                                            Add 1 to both sides
      = 0.25 (1.0025)12N -1                 Now take the log of both sides
           1.25 = (1.0025)12N               Use the exponent property of logs
                                            Divide by 12log(1.0025)
        log (1.25) = log ((1.0025)12N )
                                            Approximating to a decimal
           log (1.25) = 12N log (1.0025)
              log (1.25) = N

           12 log (1.0025)

N = 7.447 years
It will take about 7.447 years to grow the account to $10,000.

1.
I = $30 of interest
P0 = $500 principal
r = unknown
t = 1 month

Using I = P0rt, we get 30 = 500·r·1. Solving, we get r = 0.06, or 6%. Since the time was
monthly, this is the monthly interest. The annual rate would be 12 times this: 72% interest.

2.            the daily deposit
d = $5        3% annual rate
r = 0.03      since we're doing daily deposits, we'll compound daily

P10 = 0.03 = $21,282.07

                  365
We would have deposited a total of $5·365·10 = $18,250, so $3,032.07 is from interest

3.                   4% annual rate
d = unknown          since we're doing annual scholarships
r = 0.04             20 years
k = 1                we're starting with $100,000
N = 20

100,000 = 0.04

                1

Solving for d gives $7,358.18 each year that they can give in scholarships.

It is worth noting that usually donors instead specify that only interest is to be used for
scholarship, which makes the original donation last indefinitely. If this donor had specified
that, $100,000(0.04) = $4,000 a year would have been available.

Exploration
    39. Pay day loans are short term loans that you take out against future paychecks: The
         company advances you money against a future paycheck. Either visit a pay day loan
         company, or look one up online. Be forewarned that many companies do not make
         their fees obvious, so you might need to do some digging or look at several
         companies.
             a. Explain the general method by which the loan works.
             b. We will assume that we need to borrow $500 and that we will pay back the
                  loan in 14 days. Determine the total amount that you would need to pay back
                  and the effective loan rate. The effective loan rate is the percentage of the
                  original loan amount that you pay back. It is not the same as the APR (annual
                  rate) that is probably published.
             c. If you cannot pay back the loan after 14 days, you will need to get an
                  extension for another 14 days. Determine the fees for an extension, determine
                  the total amount you will be paying for the now 28 day loan, and compute the
                  effective loan rate.

    40. Suppose that 10 years ago you bought a home for $110,000, paying 10% as a down
         payment, and financing the rest at 9% interest for 30 years.
             a. Let's consider your existing mortgage:
                       i. How much money did you pay as your down payment?
                      ii. How much money was your mortgage (loan) for?
                     iii. What is your current monthly payment?
                     iv. How much total interest will you pay over the life of the loan?
             b. This year, you check your loan balance. Only part of your payments have
                  been going to pay down the loan; the rest has been going towards interest.
                  You see that you still have $88,536 left to pay on your loan. Your house is
                  now valued at $150,000.
                       i. How much of the loan have you paid off? (i.e., how much have you
                           reduced the loan balance by? Keep in mind that interest is charged
                           each month - it's not part of the loan balance.)
                      ii. How much money have you paid to the loan company so far?
                     iii. How much interest have you paid so far?
                     iv. How much equity do you have in your home (equity is value minus
                           remaining debt)
             c. Since interest rates have dropped, you consider refinancing your mortgage at a
                  lower 6% rate.
                       i. If you took out a new 30 year mortgage at 6% for your remaining loan
                           balance, what would your new monthly payments be?
                      ii. How much interest will you pay over the life of the new loan?
             d. Notice that if you refinance, you are going to be making payments on your
                  home for another 30 years. In addition to the 10 years you've already been
                  paying, that's 40 years total.
                       i. How much will you save each month because of the lower monthly
                           payment?
                      ii. How much total interest will you be paying (you need to consider the
                           amount from 2c and 3b)
                     iii. Does it make sense to refinance? (there isn't a correct answer to this
                           question. Just give your opinion and your reason)

Statistics

     Like most people, you probably feel that it is important to "take control of your life." But
     what does this mean? Partly it means being able to properly evaluate the data and claims that
     bombard you every day. If you cannot distinguish good from faulty reasoning, then you are
     vulnerable to manipulation and to decisions that are not in your best interest. Statistics
     provides tools that you need in order to react intelligently to information you hear or read. In
     this sense, Statistics is one of the most important things that you can study.

To be more specific, here are some claims that we have heard on several occasions. (We are
not saying that each one of these claims is true!)

   o 4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne.
   o Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.
   o Condoms are effective 94% of the time.
   o Native Americans are significantly more likely to be hit crossing the streets than are

         people of other ethnicities.

   o People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak

         loudly and quickly.

   o Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.
   o A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.
   o People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a

         batting average over 400.

   o There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will

         share the same birthday.

   o 79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.

All of these claims are statistical in character. We suspect that some of them sound familiar;
if not, we bet that you have heard other claims like them. Notice how diverse the examples
are; they come from psychology, health, law, sports, business, etc. Indeed, data and data-
interpretation show up in discourse from virtually every facet of contemporary life.

Statistics are often presented in an effort to add credibility to an argument or advice. You can
see this by paying attention to television advertisements. Many of the numbers thrown about
in this way do not represent careful statistical analysis. They can be misleading, and push you
into decisions that you might find cause to regret. For these reasons, learning about statistics
is a long step towards taking control of your life. (It is not, of course, the only step needed for
this purpose.) These chapters will help you learn statistical essentials. It will make you into
an intelligent consumer of statistical claims.

You can take the first step right away. To be an intelligent consumer of statistics, your first
reflex must be to question the statistics that you encounter. The British Prime Minister
Benjamin Disraeli famously said, "There are three kinds of lies -- lies, damned lies, and
statistics." This quote reminds us why it is so important to understand statistics. So let us
invite you to reform your statistical habits from now on. No longer will you blindly accept
numbers or findings. Instead, you will begin to think about the numbers, their sources, and
most importantly, the procedures used to generate them.

     We have put the emphasis on defending ourselves against fraudulent claims wrapped up as
     statistics. Just as important as detecting the deceptive use of statistics is the appreciation of
     the proper use of statistics. You must also learn to recognize statistical evidence that
     supports a stated conclusion. When a research team is testing a new treatment for a disease,
     statistics allows them to conclude based on a relatively small trial that there is good evidence
     their drug is effective. Statistics allowed prosecutors in the 1950's and 60's to demonstrate
     racial bias existed in jury panels. Statistics are all around you, sometimes used well,
     sometimes not. We must learn how to distinguish the two cases.

 Populations and samples
     Before we begin gathering and analyzing data we need to characterize the population we are
     studying. If we want to study the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical first-year
     college student, our population might be all first-year students at your college. Or it might
     be:
          · All first-year community college students in the state of Washington.
          · All first-year students at public colleges and universities in the state of Washington.
          · All first-year students at all colleges and universities in the state of Washington.
          · All first-year students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States.
          · And so on.

         Population
         The population of a study is the group the collected data is intended to describe.

     Sometimes the intended population is called the target population, since if we design our
     study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended
     population.

     Why is it important to specify the population? We might get different answers to our
     question as we vary the population we are studying. First-year students at the University of
     Washington might take slightly more diverse courses than those at your college, and some of
     these courses may require less popular textbooks that cost more; or, on the other hand, the
     University Bookstore might have a larger pool of used textbooks, reducing the cost of these
     books to the students. Whichever the case (and it is likely that some combination of these
     and other factors are in play), the data we gather from your college will probably not be the
     same as that from the University of Washington. Particularly when conveying our results to
     others, we want to be clear about the population we are describing with our data.

Example 1
     A newspaper website contains a poll asking people their opinion on a recent news article.
     What is the population?

     While the target (intended) population may have been all people, the real population of the
     survey is readers of the website.
                                                                                           Statistics 229

If we were able to gather data on every member of our population, say the average (we will
define "average" more carefully in a subsequent section) amount of money spent on
textbooks by each first-year student at your college during the 2009-2010 academic year, the
resulting number would be called a parameter.

   Parameter
   A parameter is a value (average, percentage, etc.) calculated using all the data from a
   population

We seldom see parameters, however, since surveying an entire population is usually very
time-consuming and expensive, unless the population is very small or we already have the
data collected.

   Census
   A survey of an entire population is called a census.

You are probably familiar with two common censuses: the official government Census that
attempts to count the population of the U.S. every ten years, and voting, which asks the
opinion of all eligible voters in a district. The first of these demonstrates one additional
problem with a census: the difficulty in finding and getting participation from everyone in a
large population, which can bias, or skew, the results.

There are occasionally times when a census is appropriate, usually when the population is
fairly small. For example, if the manager of Starbucks wanted to know the average number
of hours her employees worked last week, she should be able to pull up payroll records or ask
each employee directly.

Since surveying an entire population is often impractical, we usually select a sample to
study;

   Sample
   A sample is a smaller subset of the entire population, ideally one that is fairly
   representative of the whole population.

We will discuss sampling methods in greater detail in a later section. For now, let us assume
that samples are chosen in an appropriate manner. If we survey a sample, say 100 first-year
students at your college, and find the average amount of money spent by these students on
textbooks, the resulting number is called a statistic.

   Statistic
   A statistic is a value (average, percentage, etc.) calculated using the data from a
   sample.
     230

Example 2
     A researcher wanted to know how citizens of Tacoma felt about a voter initiative. To study
     this, she goes to the Tacoma Mall and randomly selects 500 shoppers and asks them their
     opinion. 60% indicate they are supportive of the initiative. What is the sample and
     population? Is the 60% value a parameter or a statistic?

     The sample is the 500 shoppers questioned. The population is less clear. While the intended
     population of this survey was Tacoma citizens, the effective population was mall shoppers.
     There is no reason to assume that the 500 shoppers questioned would be representative of all
     Tacoma citizens.

     The 60% value was based on the sample, so it is a statistic.

     To determine the average length of trout in a lake, researchers catch 20 fish and measure
     them. What is the sample and population in this study?

     Try it Now 2
     A college reports that the average age of their students is 28 years old. Is this a statistic or a
     parameter?

 Categorizing data
     Once we have gathered data, we might wish to classify it. Roughly speaking, data can be
     classified as categorical data or quantitative data.

         Quantitative and categorical data
         Categorical (qualitative) data are pieces of information that allow us to classify the
         objects under investigation into various categories.

         Quantitative data are responses that are numerical in nature and with which we can
         perform meaningful arithmetic calculations.

Example 3
     We might conduct a survey to determine the name of the favorite movie that each person in a
     math class saw in a movie theater.

     When we conduct such a survey, the responses would look like: Finding Nemo, The Hulk, or
     Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. We might count the number of people who give each
     answer, but the answers themselves do not have any numerical values: we cannot perform
     computations with an answer like "Finding Nemo." This would be categorical data.
                                                                                                Statistics 231

Example 4
     A survey could ask the number of movies you have seen in a movie theater in the past 12
     months (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...)

     This would be quantitative data.

     Other examples of quantitative data would be the running time of the movie you saw most
     recently (104 minutes, 137 minutes, 104 minutes, ...) or the amount of money you paid for a
     movie ticket the last time you went to a movie theater ($5.50, $7.75, $9, ...).

     Sometimes, determining whether or not data is categorical or quantitative can be a bit
     trickier.

Example 5
     Suppose we gather respondents' ZIP codes in a survey to track their geographical location.

      ZIP codes are numbers, but we can't do any meaningful mathematical calculations with them
     (it doesn't make sense to say that 98036 is "twice" 49018 -- that's like saying that
     Lynnwood, WA is "twice" Battle Creek, MI, which doesn't make sense at all), so ZIP codes
     are really categorical data.

Example 6
     A survey about the movie you most recently attended includes the question "How would you
     rate the movie you just saw?" with these possible answers:

      1 - it was awful
      2 - it was just OK
      3 - I liked it
      4 - it was great
      5 - best movie ever!

     Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but we can't really do any
     calculations with them: a movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that
     rates a 2, whatever that means; if two people see the movie and one of them thinks it stinks
     and the other thinks it's the best ever it doesn't necessarily make sense to say that "on average
     they liked it."

     As we study movie-going habits and preferences, we shouldn't forget to specify the
     population under consideration. If we survey 3-7 year-olds the runaway favorite might be
     Finding Nemo. 13-17 year-olds might prefer Terminator 3. And 33-37 year-olds might
     prefer...well, Finding Nemo.

Sampling methods
   As we mentioned in a previous section, the first thing we should do before conducting a
   survey is to identify the population that we want to study. Suppose we are hired by a
   politician to determine the amount of support he has among the electorate should he decide to
   run for another term. What population should we study? Every person in the district? Not
   every person is eligible to vote, and regardless of how strongly someone likes or dislikes the
   candidate, they don't have much to do with him being re-elected if they are not able to vote.

   What about eligible voters in the district? That might be better, but if someone is eligible to
   vote but does not register by the deadline, they won't have any say in the election either.
   What about registered voters? Many people are registered but choose not to vote. What
   about "likely voters?"

   This is the criteria used in much political polling, but it is sometimes difficult to define a
   "likely voter." Is it someone who voted in the last election? In the last general election? In
   the last presidential election? Should we consider someone who just turned 18 a "likely
   voter?" They weren't eligible to vote in the past, so how do we judge the likelihood that they
   will vote in the next election?

   In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse "The Body" Ventura was elected
   governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little
   chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the
   actual intent of the electorate:

        · Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better
            suited to a two-candidate race.

        · Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were
            planning to vote for a professional wrestler.

        · The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have
            prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party
            candidates.

   But one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of
   support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and
   who registered specifically to vote in the gubernatorial election. The polls did not deem
   these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter
   registration and a turnout rate for elections) and so the polling samples were subject to
   sampling bias: they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the
   winning candidate.

         Sampling bias
         A sampling method is biased if every member of the population doesn't have equal
         likelihood of being in the sample.

     So even identifying the population can be a difficult job, but once we have identified the
     population, how do we choose an appropriate sample? Remember, although we would prefer
     to survey all members of the population, this is usually impractical unless the population is
     very small, so we choose a sample. There are many ways to sample a population, but there is
     one goal we need to keep in mind: we would like the sample to be representative of the
     population.

     Returning to our hypothetical job as a political pollster, we would not anticipate very
     accurate results if we drew all of our samples from among the customers at a Starbucks, nor
     would we expect that a sample drawn entirely from the membership list of the local Elks club
     would provide a useful picture of district-wide support for our candidate.

     One way to ensure that the sample has a reasonable chance of mirroring the population is to
     employ randomness. The most basic random method is simple random sampling.

         Simple random sample
         A random sample is one in which each member of the population has an equal
         probability of being chosen. A simple random sample is one in which every member
         of the population and any group of members has an equal probability of being chosen.

Example 7
     If we could somehow identify all likely voters in the state, put each of their names on a piece
     of paper, toss the slips into a (very large) hat and draw 1000 slips out of the hat, we would
     have a simple random sample.

     In practice, computers are better suited for this sort of endeavor than millions of slips of
     paper and extremely large headgear.

     It is always possible, however, that even a random sample might end up not being totally
     representative of the population. If we repeatedly take samples of 1000 people from among
     the population of likely voters in the state of Washington, some of these samples might tend
     to have a slightly higher percentage of Democrats (or Republicans) than does the general
     population; some samples might include more older people and some samples might include
     more younger people; etc. In most cases, this sampling variability is not significant.

         Sampling variability
         The natural variation of samples is called sampling variability.
         This is unavoidable and expected in random sampling, and in most cases is not an
         issue.
     234

     To help account for variability, pollsters might instead use a stratified sample.

         Stratified sampling
         In stratified sampling, a population is divided into a number of subgroups (or strata).
         Random samples are then taken from each subgroup with sample sizes proportional to
         the size of the subgroup in the population.

Example 8
     Suppose in a particular state that previous data indicated that the electorate was comprised of
     39% Democrats, 37% Republicans and 24% independents. In a sample of 1000 people, they
     would then expect to get about 390 Democrats, 370 Republicans and 240 independents. To
     accomplish this, they could randomly select 390 people from among those voters known to
     be Democrats, 370 from those known to be Republicans, and 240 from those with no party
     affiliation.

     Stratified sampling can also be used to select a sample with people in desired age groups, a
     specified mix ratio of males and females, etc. A variation on this technique is called quota
     sampling.

         Quota sampling
         Quota sampling is a variation on stratified sampling, wherein samples are collected in
         each subgroup until the desired quota is met.

Example 9
     Suppose the pollsters call people at random, but once they have met their quota of 390
     Democrats, they only gather people who do not identify themselves as a Democrat.

     You may have had the experience of being called by a telephone pollster who started by
     asking you your age, income, etc. and then thanked you for your time and hung up before
     asking any "real" questions. Most likely, they already had contacted enough people in your
     demographic group and were looking for people who were older or younger, richer or poorer,
     etc. Quota sampling is usually a bit easier than stratified sampling, but also does not ensure
     the same level of randomness.

     Another sampling method is cluster sampling, in which the population is divided into
     groups, and one or more groups are randomly selected to be in the sample.
     .

         Cluster sampling
         In cluster sampling, the population is divided into subgroups (clusters), and a set of
         subgroups are selected to be in the sample
                                                                                                Statistics 235

Example 10
     If the college wanted to survey students, since students are already divided into classes, they
     could randomly select 10 classes and give the survey to all the students in those classes. This
     would be cluster sampling.

     Other sampling methods include systematic sampling.

         Systematic sampling
         In systematic sampling, every nth member of the population is selected to be in the
         sample.

Example 11
     To select a sample using systematic sampling, a pollster calls every 100th name in the phone
     book.

     Systematic sampling is not as random as a simple random sample (if your name is Albert
     Aardvark and your sister Alexis Aardvark is right after you in the phone book, there is no
     way you could both end up in the sample) but it can yield acceptable samples.

     Perhaps the worst types of sampling methods are convenience samples and voluntary
     response samples.

         Convenience sampling and voluntary response sampling
         Convenience sampling is samples chosen by selecting whoever is convenient.
         Voluntary response sampling is allowing the sample to volunteer.

Example 12
     A pollster stands on a street corner and interviews the first 100 people who agree to speak to
     him. This is a convenience sample.

Example 13
     A website has a survey asking readers to give their opinion on a tax proposal. This is a self-
     selected sample, or voluntary response sample, in which respondents volunteer to
     participate.

     Usually voluntary response samples are skewed towards people who have a particularly
     strong opinion about the subject of the survey or who just have way too much time on their
     hands and enjoy taking surveys.

     In each case, indicate what sampling method was used

 How to mess things up before you start
     There are number of ways that a study can be ruined before you even start collecting data.
     The first we have already explored - sampling or selection bias, which is when the sample
     is not representative of the population. One example of this is voluntary response bias,
     which is bias introduced by only collecting data from those who volunteer to participate.
     This is not the only potential source of bias.

         Sources of bias
         Sampling bias - when the sample is not representative of the population
         Voluntary response bias - the sampling bias that often occurs when the sample is

              volunteers
         Self-interest study - bias that can occur when the researchers have an interest in the

              outcome
         Response bias - when the responder gives inaccurate responses for any reason
         Perceived lack of anonymity - when the responder fears giving an honest answer

              might negatively affect them
         Loaded questions - when the question wording influences the responses
         Non-response bias - when people refusing to participate in the study can influence the

              validity of the outcome

Example 14
     Consider a recent study which found that chewing gum may raise math grades in teenagers1.
     This study was conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing
     gum company. This is an example of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have
     a vested interest in the outcome of the study. While this does not necessarily ensure that the
     study was biased, it certainly suggests that we should subject the study to extra scrutiny.

Example 15
     A survey asks people "when was the last time you visited your doctor?" This might suffer
     from response bias, since many people might not remember exactly when they last saw a
     doctor and give inaccurate responses.

     Sources of response bias may be innocent, such as bad memory, or as intentional as
     pressuring by the pollster. Consider, for example, how many voting initiative petitions
     people sign without even reading them.

Example 16
     A survey asks participants a question about their interactions with members of other races.
     Here, a perceived lack of anonymity could influence the outcome. The respondent might
     not want to be perceived as racist even if they are, and give an untruthful answer.

Example 17
     An employer puts out a survey asking their employees if they have a drug abuse problem and
     need treatment help. Here, answering truthfully might have consequences; responses might
     not be accurate if the employees do not feel their responses are anonymous or fear retribution
     from their employer.

Example 18
     A survey asks "do you support funding research of alternative energy sources to reduce our
     reliance on high-polluting fossil fuels?" This is an example of a loaded or leading question
     - questions whose wording leads the respondent towards an answer.

     Loaded questions can occur intentionally by pollsters with an agenda, or accidentally through
     poor question wording. Also a concern is question order, where the order of questions
     changes the results. A psychology researcher provides an example2:

              "My favorite finding is this: we did a study where we asked students, 'How satisfied
              are you with your life? How often do you have a date?' The two answers were not
              statistically related - you would conclude that there is no relationship between dating
              frequency and life satisfaction. But when we reversed the order and asked, 'How often
              do you have a date? How satisfied are you with your life?' the statistical relationship
              was a strong one. You would now conclude that there is nothing as important in a
              student's life as dating frequency."

Example 19
     A telephone poll asks the question "Do you often have time to relax and read a book?", and
     50% of the people called refused to answer the survey. It is unlikely that the results will be
     representative of the entire population. This is an example of non-response bias, introduced
     by people refusing to participate in a study or dropping out of an experiment. When people
     refuse to participate, we can no longer be so certain that our sample is representative of the
     population.

 Experiments
     So far, we have primarily discussed observational studies - studies in which conclusions
     would be drawn from observations of a sample or the population. In some cases these
     observations might be unsolicited, such as studying the percentage of cars that turn right at a
     red light even when there is a "no turn on red" sign. In other cases the observations are
     solicited, like in a survey or a poll.

     In contrast, it is common to use experiments when exploring how subjects react to an
     outside influence. In an experiment, some kind of treatment is applied to the subjects and
     the results are measured and recorded.

         Observational studies and experiments
         An observational study is a study based on observations or measurements
         An experiment is a study in which the effects of a treatment are measured

     Here are some examples of experiments:

Example 20
       a. A pharmaceutical company tests a new medicine for treating Alzheimer's disease by
            administering the drug to 50 elderly patients with recent diagnoses. The treatment here
            is the new drug.
       b. A gym tests out a new weight loss program by enlisting 30 volunteers to try out the
            program. The treatment here is the new program.
       c. You test a new kitchen cleaner by buying a bottle and cleaning your kitchen. The new
            cleaner is the treatment.
       d. A psychology researcher explores the effect of music on temperament by measuring
            people's temperament while listening to different types of music. The music is the
            treatment.
                                                                                                Statistics 239

     Is each scenario describing an observational study or an experiment?
     a. The weights of 30 randomly selected people are measured
     b. Subjects are asked to do 20 jumping jacks, and then their heart rates are measured
     c. Twenty coffee drinkers and twenty tea drinkers are given a concentration test

     When conducting experiments, it is essential to isolate the treatment being tested.

Example 21
     Suppose a middle school (junior high) finds that their students are not scoring well on the
     state's standardized math test. They decide to run an experiment to see if an alternate
     curriculum would improve scores. To run the test, they hire a math specialist to come in and
     teach a class using the new curriculum. To their delight, they see an improvement in test
     scores.

     The difficulty with this scenario is that it is not clear whether the curriculum is responsible
     for the improvement, or whether the improvement is due to a math specialist teaching the
     class. This is called confounding - when it is not clear which factor or factors caused the
     observed effect. Confounding is the downfall of many experiments, though sometimes it is
     hidden.

         Confounding
         Confounding occurs when there are two potential variables that could have caused the
         outcome and it is not possible to determine which actually caused the result.

Example 22
     A drug company study about a weight loss pill might report that people lost an average of 8
     pounds while using their new drug. However, in the fine print you find a statement saying
     that participants were encouraged to also diet and exercise. It is not clear in this case whether
     the weight loss is due to the pill, to diet and exercise, or a combination of both. In this case
     confounding has occurred.

Example 23
     Researchers conduct an experiment to determine whether students will perform better on an
     arithmetic test if they listen to music during the test. They first give the student a test without
     music, then give a similar test while the student listens to music. In this case, the student
     might perform better on the second test, regardless of the music, simply because it was the
     second test and they were warmed up.

     There are a number of measures that can be introduced to help reduce the likelihood of
     confounding. The primary measure is to use a control group.
     240

         Control group
         When using a control group, the participants are divided into two or more groups,
         typically a control group and a treatment group. The treatment group receives the
         treatment being tested; the control group does not receive the treatment.

     Ideally, the groups are otherwise as similar as possible, isolating the treatment as the only
     potential source of difference between the groups. For this reason, the method of dividing
     groups is important. Some researchers attempt to ensure that the groups have similar
     characteristics (same number of females, same number of people over 50, etc.), but it is
     nearly impossible to control for every characteristic. Because of this, random assignment is
     very commonly used.

Example 24
     To determine if a two day prep course would help high school students improve their scores
     on the SAT test, a group of students was randomly divided into two subgroups. The first
     group, the treatment group, was given a two day prep course. The second group, the control
     group, was not given the prep course. Afterwards, both groups were given the SAT.

Example 25
     A company testing a new plant food grows two crops of plants in adjacent fields, the
     treatment group receiving the new plant food and the control group not. The crop yield
     would then be compared. By growing them at the same time in adjacent fields, they are
     controlling for weather and other confounding factors.

     Sometimes not giving the control group anything does not completely control for
     confounding variables. For example, suppose a medicine study is testing a new headache pill
     by giving the treatment group the pill and the control group nothing. If the treatment group
     showed improvement, we would not know whether it was due to the medicine in the pill, or a
     response to have taken any pill. This is called a placebo effect.

         Placebo effect
         The placebo effect is when the effectiveness of a treatment is influenced by the
         patient's perception of how effective they think the treatment will be, so a result might
         be seen even if the treatment is ineffectual.

Example 26
     A study found that when doing painful dental tooth extractions, patients told they were
     receiving a strong painkiller while actually receiving a saltwater injection found as much
     pain relief as patients receiving a dose of morphine.3

      3 Levine JD, Gordon NC, Smith R, Fields HL. (1981) Analgesic responses to morphine and placebo in
      individuals with postoperative pain. Pain. 10:379-89.
                                                                                                Statistics 241

     To control for the placebo effect, a placebo, or dummy treatment, is often given to the
     control group. This way, both groups are truly identical except for the specific treatment
     given.

         Placebo and Placebo controlled experiments
         A placebo is a dummy treatment given to control for the placebo effect.
         An experiment that gives the control group a placebo is called a placebo controlled
         experiment.

Example 27
       a. In a study for a new medicine that is dispensed in a pill form, a sugar pill could be used
            as a placebo.
       b. In a study on the effect of alcohol on memory, a non-alcoholic beer might be given to
            the control group as a placebo.
       c. In a study of a frozen meal diet plan, the treatment group would receive the diet food,
            and the control could be given standard frozen meals stripped of their original
            packaging.

     In some cases, it is more appropriate to compare to a conventional treatment than a placebo.
     For example, in a cancer research study, it would not be ethical to deny any treatment to the
     control group or to give a placebo treatment. In this case, the currently acceptable medicine
     would be given to the control group, sometimes called a comparison group in this case. In
     our SAT test example, the non-treatment group would most likely be encouraged to study on
     their own, rather than be asked to not study at all, to provide a meaningful comparison.

     When using a placebo, it would defeat the purpose if the participant knew they were
     receiving the placebo.

         Blind studies
         A blind study is one in which the participant does not know whether or not they are
         receiving the treatment or a placebo.

         A double-blind study is one in which those interacting with the participants don't
         know who is in the treatment group and who is in the control group.

Example 28
     In a study about anti-depression medicine, you would not want the psychological evaluator to
     know whether the patient is in the treatment or control group either, as it might influence
     their evaluation, so the experiment should be conducted as a double-blind study.

     It should be noted that not every experiment needs a control group.

Describing Data

     Once we have collected data from surveys or experiments, we need to summarize and present
     the data in a way that will be meaningful to the reader. We will begin with graphical
     presentations of data then explore numerical summaries of data.

 Presenting Categorical Data Graphically
     Categorical, or qualitative, data are pieces of information that allow us to classify the objects
     under investigation into various categories. We usually begin working with categorical data
     by summarizing the data into a frequency table.

         Frequency Table
         A frequency table is a table with two columns. One column lists the categories, and
         another for the frequencies with which the items in the categories occur (how many
         items fit into each category).

Example 1

     An insurance company determines vehicle insurance premiums based on known risk factors.
     If a person is considered a higher risk, their premiums will be higher. One potential factor is
     the color of your car. The insurance company believes that people with some color cars are
     more likely to get in accidents. To research this, they examine police reports for recent total-
     loss collisions. The data is summarized in the frequency table below.

Color  Frequency
Blue   25
Green  52
Red    41
White  36
Black  39
Grey   23

Sometimes we need an even more intuitive way of displaying data. This is where charts and
graphs come in. There are many, many ways of displaying data graphically, but we will
concentrate on one very useful type of graph called a bar graph. In this section we will work
with bar graphs that display categorical data; the next section will be devoted to bar graphs
that display quantitative data.

   Bar graph
   A bar graph is a graph that displays a bar for each category with the length of each bar
   indicating the frequency of that category.

     248Frequency

     To construct a bar graph, we need to draw a vertical axis and a horizontal axis. The vertical
     direction will have a scale and measure the frequency of each category; the horizontal axis
     has no scale in this instance. The construction of a bar chart is most easily described by use
     of an example.

Example 2
     Using our car data from above, note the highest frequency is 52, so our vertical axis needs to
     go from 0 to 52, but we might as well use 0 to 55, so that we can put a hash mark every 5
     units:

                55
                50
                45
                40
                35
                30
                25
                20
                15
                10

                  5
                  0

                         Blue Green Red White Black Grey
                          Vehicle color involved in total-loss collision

Notice that the height of each bar is determined by the frequency of the corresponding
color. The horizontal gridlines are a nice touch, but not necessary. In practice, you will find
it useful to draw bar graphs using graph paper, so the gridlines will already be in place, or
using technology. Instead of gridlines, we might also list the frequencies at the top of each
bar, like this:

           55 52
           50
           45     41      39
                      36
Frequency  40
           35
           30 25
           25                 23

           20
           15
           10
           5
           0

               Blue Green Red White Black Grey

               Vehicle color involved in total-loss collision

In this case, our chart might benefit from being reordered from largest to smallest frequency
values. This arrangement can make it easier to compare similar values in the chart, even
without gridlines. When we arrange the categories in decreasing frequency order like this, it
is called a Pareto chart.
                                                                              Describing Data 249

Pareto chart
A Pareto chart is a bar graph ordered from highest to lowest frequency

     Transforming our bar graph from earlier into a Pareto chart, we get:

           45     41  39

Example 4
     In a survey1, adults were asked whether they personally worried about a variety of
     environmental concerns. The numbers (out of 1012 surveyed) who indicated that they
     worried "a great deal" about some selected concerns are summarized below.

           Environmental Issue                                 Frequency
           Pollution of drinking water                         597
           Contamination of soil and water by toxic waste      526
           Air pollution                                       455
           Global warming                                      354

     To show relative sizes, it is common to use a pie chart.

         Pie Chart
         A pie chart is a circle with wedges cut of varying sizes marked out like slices of pie or
         pizza. The relative sizes of the wedges correspond to the relative frequencies of the
         categories.

Example 5
     For our vehicle color data, a pie chart might look like this:
                  Vehicle color involved in total-loss collisions

                                                                                     Green
                                                                                     Red
                                                                                     Black
                                                                                     White
                                                                                     Blue
                                                                                     Grey

     Pie charts can often benefit from including frequencies or relative frequencies (percents) in
     the chart next to the pie slices. Often having the category names next to the pie slices also
     makes the chart clearer.

     about 2,200 voters, support Reeves.

Pie charts look nice, but are harder to draw by hand than bar charts since to draw them
accurately we would need to compute the angle each wedge cuts out of the circle, then
measure the angle with a protractor. Computers are much better suited to drawing pie charts.
Common software programs like Microsoft Word or Excel, OpenOffice.org Write or Calc, or
Google Docs are able to create bar graphs, pie charts, and other graph types. There are also
numerous online tools that can create graphs2.

Here is another way that fanciness can      Car Color
lead to trouble. Instead of plain bars, it
is tempting to substitute meaningful
images. This type of graph is called a
pictogram.

Pictogram
A pictogram is a statistical graphic in which the size of the picture is intended to
represent the frequencies or size of the values being represented.

Example 7                                                           Manager         Worker
     A labor union might produce the graph to the right to show     Salaries        Salaries
     the difference between the average manager salary and the
     average worker salary.

     Looking at the picture, it would be reasonable to guess that
     the manager salaries is 4 times as large as the worker
     salaries - the area of the bag looks about 4 times as large.
     However, the manager salaries are in fact only twice as large
     as worker salaries, which were reflected in the picture by
     making the manager bag twice as tall.

Another distortion in bar charts results from setting the baseline to a value other than zero.
The baseline is the bottom of the vertical axis, representing the least number of cases that
could have occurred in a category. Normally, this number should be zero.

Example 8

     Compare the two graphs below showing support for same-sex marriage rights from a poll
     taken in December 20083. The difference in the vertical scale on the first graph suggests a
     different story than the true differences in percentages; the second graph makes it look like
     twice as many people oppose marriage rights as support it.

Presenting Quantitative Data Graphically
   Quantitative, or numerical, data can also be summarized into frequency tables.

Example 9
     A teacher records scores on a 20-point quiz for the 30 students in his class. The scores are:

19 20 18 18 17 18 19 17 20 18 20 16 20 15 17 12 18 19 18 19 17 20 18 16 15 18 20 5 0 0

These scores could be summarized into a frequency table by grouping like values:

           Score     Frequency
             0             2
             5             1
             12            1
             15            2
             16            2
             17            4
             18            8
             19            4
             20            6

Using this table, it would be possible to create a standard bar chart from this summary, like
we did for categorical data:

Frequency  8
           7
           6         5 12 15 16 17 18 19 20

           2
           1
           0

                  0

However, since the scores are numerical values, this chart doesn't really make sense; the first
and second bars are five values apart, while the later bars are only one value apart. It would
be more correct to treat the horizontal axis as a number line. This type of graph is called a
histogram.

left hand-side of the bar up to, but not including, the value on the right hand side of the bar.

If we have a large number of widely varying data values, creating a frequency table that lists
every possible value as a category would lead to an exceptionally long frequency table, and
probably would not reveal any patterns. For this reason, it is common with quantitative data
to group data into class intervals.

   Class Intervals
   Class intervals are groupings of the data. In general, we define class intervals so that:
   · Each interval is equal in size. For example, if the first class contains values from

        120-129, the second class should include values from 130-139.
   · We have somewhere between 5 and 20 classes, typically, depending upon the

        number of data we're working with.
                                                               Describing Data 255

Example 11

     Suppose that we have collected weights from 100 male subjects as part of a nutrition study.
     For our weight data, we have values ranging from a low of 121 pounds to a high of 263
     pounds, giving a total span of 263-121 = 142. We could create 7 intervals with a width of
     around 20, 14 intervals with a width of around 10, or somewhere in between. Often time we
     have to experiment with a few possibilities to find something that represents the data well.
     Let us try using an interval width of 15. We could start at 121, or at 120 since it is a nice
     round number.

           Interval   Frequency
           120 - 134        4
           135 - 149       14
           150 - 164       16
           165 - 179       28
           180 - 194       12
           195 - 209        8
           210 - 224        7
           225 - 239        6
           240 - 254        2
           255 - 269        3

A histogram of this data would look like:

In many software packages, you can create a graph similar to a histogram by putting the class
intervals as the labels on a bar chart.

When collecting data to compare two groups, it is desirable to create a graph that compares
quantities.

Example 12

     The data below came from a task in which the goal is to move a computer mouse to a target
     on the screen as fast as possible. On 20 of the trials, the target was a small rectangle; on the
     other 20, the target was a large rectangle. Time to reach the target was recorded on each trial.

   800-899            4             0
   900-999            0             0
  1000-1099           1             0
  1100-1199           0             0

One option to represent this data would be a comparative histogram or bar chart, in which
bars for the small target group and large target group are placed next to each other.

Frequency polygon
An alternative representation is a frequency polygon. A frequency polygon starts out
like a histogram, but instead of drawing a bar, a point is placed in the midpoint of each
interval at height equal to the frequency. Typically the points are connected with
straight lines to emphasize the distribution of the data.
258

Example 13
     This graph makes it easier to see that reaction times were generally shorter for the larger
     target, and that the reaction times for the smaller target were more spread out.

 Numerical Summaries of Data
     It is often desirable to use a few numbers to summarize a distribution. One important aspect
     of a distribution is where its center is located. Measures of central tendency are discussed
     first. A second aspect of a distribution is how spread out it is. In other words, how much the
     data in the distribution vary from one another. The second section describes measures of
     variability.

 Measures of Central Tendency
     Let's begin by trying to find the most "typical" value of a data set.

     Note that we just used the word "typical" although in many cases you might think of using
     the word "average." We need to be careful with the word "average" as it means different
     things to different people in different contexts. One of the most common uses of the word
     "average" is what mathematicians and statisticians call the arithmetic mean, or just plain old
     mean for short. "Arithmetic mean" sounds rather fancy, but you have likely calculated a
     mean many times without realizing it; the mean is what most people think of when they use
     the word "average".

         Mean
         The mean of a set of data is the sum of the data values divided by the number of
         values.

Example 14
     Marci's exam scores for her last math class were: 79, 86, 82, 94. The mean of these values
     would be:

      79 + 86 + 82 + 94 = 85.25 . Typically we round means to one more decimal place than the
               4

     original data had. In this case, we would round 85.25 to 85.3.
                                                                                       Describing Data 259

Example 15
     The number of touchdown (TD) passes thrown by each of the 31 teams in the National
     Football League in the 2000 season are shown below.
         37 33 33 32 29 28 28 23 22 22 22 21 21 21 20
         20 19 19 18 18 18 18 16 15 14 14 14 12 12 9 6

     Adding these values, we get 634 total TDs. Dividing by 31, the number of data values, we
     get 634/31 = 20.4516. It would be appropriate to round this to 20.5.

     It would be most correct for us to report that "The mean number of touchdown passes thrown
     in the NFL in the 2000 season was 20.5 passes," but it is not uncommon to see the more
     casual word "average" used in place of "mean."

Calculating the mean by hand could get tricky if we try to type in all 100 values:
6terms  8terms  11terms 
15 + +15 + 20 + + 20 + 25 + + 25 +

                        100

We could calculate this more easily by noticing that adding 15 to itself six times is the same
as 15 6 = 90. Using this simplification, we get

15 6 + 20 8 + 2511+ 30 17 + 3519 + 40  20 + 4512 + 50  7 3390
                                          = = 33.9
100                                       100

The mean household income of our sample is 33.9 thousand dollars ($33,900).

     that has a household income of $5 million ($5000 thousand). Adding this to our sample, our
     mean is now:

15 6 + 20 8 + 2511+ 30 17 + 3519 + 40  20 + 4512 + 50  7 + 5000 1 8390
          = = 83.069
     101  101

While 83.1 thousand dollars ($83,069) is the correct mean household income, it no longer
represents a "typical" value.

Imagine the data values on a see-saw or balance scale. The mean is the value that keeps the
data in balance, like in the picture below.

If we graph our household data, the $5 million data value is so far out to the right that the
mean has to adjust up to keep things in balance

For this reason, when working with data that have outliers - values far outside the primary
grouping - it is common to use a different measure of center, the median.

   Median
   The median of a set of data is the value in the middle when the data is in order

   To find the median, begin by listing the data in order from smallest to largest, or largest
   to smallest.

   If the number of data values, N, is odd, then the median is the middle data value. This
   value can be found by rounding N/2 up to the next whole number.

   If the number of data values is even, there is no one middle value, so we find the mean
   of the two middle values (values N/2 and N/2 + 1)
                                                                                       Describing Data 261

Example 18
     Returning to the football touchdown data, we would start by listing the data in order.
     Luckily, it was already in decreasing order, so we can work with it without needing to
     reorder it first.
         37 33 33 32 29 28 28 23 22 22 22 21 21 21 20
         20 19 19 18 18 18 18 16 15 14 14 14 12 12 9 6

     Since there are 31 data values, an odd number, the median will be the middle number, the
     16th data value (31/2 = 15.5, round up to 16, leaving 15 values below and 15 above). The
     16th data value is 20, so the median number of touchdown passes in the 2000 season was 20
     passes. Notice that for this data, the median is fairly close to the mean we calculated earlier,
     20.5.

Example 19
     Find the median of these quiz scores: 5 10 8 6 4 8 2 5 7 7

     We start by listing the data in order: 2 4 5 5 6 7 7 8 8 10

     Since there are 10 data values, an even number, there is no one middle number. So we find
     the mean of the two middle numbers, 6 and 7, and get (6+7)/2 = 6.5.

     The median quiz score was 6.5.

Example 20
     Let us return now to our original household income data

Income (thousands of dollars)  Frequency

50                             7

Here we have 100 data values. If we didn't already know that, we could find it by adding the

frequencies. Since 100 is an even number, we need to find the mean of the middle two data
values - the 50th and 51st data values. To find these, we start counting up from the bottom:
262

There are 6 data values of $15, so   Values 1 to 6 are $15 thousand
The next 8 data values are $20, so   Values 7 to (6+8)=14 are $20 thousand
The next 11 data values are $25, so  Values 15 to (14+11)=25 are $25 thousand
The next 17 data values are $30, so  Values 26 to (25+17)=42 are $30 thousand
The next 19 data values are $35, so  Values 43 to (42+19)=61 are $35 thousand

From this we can tell that values 50 and 51 will be $35 thousand, and the mean of these two
values is $35 thousand. The median income in this neighborhood is $35 thousand.

Example 21

     If we add in the new neighbor with a $5 million household income, then there will be 101
     data values, and the 51st value will be the median. As we discovered in the last example, the
     51st value is $35 thousand. Notice that the new neighbor did not affect the median in this

     case. The median is not swayed as much by outliers as the mean is.

In addition to the mean and the median, there is one other common measurement of the
"typical" value of a data set: the mode.

   Mode
   The mode is the element of the data set that occurs most frequently.

The mode is fairly useless with data like weights or heights where there are a large number of
possible values. The mode is most commonly used for categorical data, for which median
and mean cannot be computed.

Example 22
     In our vehicle color survey, we collected the data

     Color  Frequency
     Blue   3
     Green  5
     Red    4
     White  3
     Black  2
     Grey   3

For this data, Green is the mode, since it is the data value that occurred the most frequently.

It is possible for a data set to have more than one mode if several categories have the same
frequency, or no modes if each every category occurs only once.

 Measures of Variation
     Consider these three sets of quiz scores:

              Section A: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5

              Section B: 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 10

              Section C: 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6

     All three of these sets of data have a mean of 5 and median of 5, yet the sets of scores are
     clearly quite different. In section A, everyone had the same score; in section B half the class
     got no points and the other half got a perfect score, assuming this was a 10-point
     quiz. Section C was not as consistent as section A, but not as widely varied as section B.

     In addition to the mean and median, which are measures of the "typical" or "middle" value,
     we also need a measure of how "spread out" or varied each data set is.

     There are several ways to measure this "spread" of the data. The first is the simplest and is
     called the range.

         Range
         The range is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the
         data set.

Example 23
     Using the quiz scores from above,

     For section A, the range is 0 since both maximum and minimum are 5 and 5 - 5 = 0
     For section B, the range is 10 since 10 - 0 = 10
     For section C, the range is 2 since 6 - 4 = 2
264

In the last example, the range seems to be revealing how spread out the data is. However,
suppose we add a fourth section, Section D, with scores 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 10.

This section also has a mean and median of 5. The range is 10, yet this data set is quite
different than Section B. To better illuminate the differences, we'll have to turn to more
sophisticated measures of variation.

   Standard deviation
   The standard deviation is a measure of variation based on measuring how far each data
   value deviates, or is different, from the mean. A few important characteristics:
   · Standard deviation is always positive. Standard deviation will be zero if all the

        data values are equal, and will get larger as the data spreads out.
   · Standard deviation has the same units as the original data.
   · Standard deviation, like the mean, can be highly influenced by outliers.

Using the data from section D, we could compute for each data value the difference between
the data value and the mean:

data value  deviation: data value - mean
0           0-5 = -5
5           5-5 = 0
5           5-5 = 0
5           5-5 = 0
5           5-5 = 0
5           5-5 = 0
5           5-5 = 0
5           5-5 = 0
5           5-5 = 0
10          10-5 = 5

We would like to get an idea of the "average" deviation from the mean, but if we find the
average of the values in the second column the negative and positive values cancel each other
out (this will always happen), so to prevent this we square every value in the second column:

data value  deviation: data value - mean  deviation squared
0           0-5 = -5                      (-5)2 = 25
5           5-5 = 0                       02 = 0
5           5-5 = 0                       02 = 0
5           5-5 = 0                       02 = 0
5           5-5 = 0                       02 = 0
5           5-5 = 0                       02 = 0
5           5-5 = 0                       02 = 0
5           5-5 = 0                       02 = 0
5           5-5 = 0                       02 = 0
10          10-5 = 5                      (5)2 = 25
                                      Describing Data 265

We then add the squared deviations up to get 25 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 25 =

50. Ordinarily we would then divide by the number of scores, n, (in this case, 10) to find the

mean of the deviations. But we only do this if the data set represents a population; if the data

set represents a sample (as it almost always does), we instead divide by n - 1 (in this case,
10 - 1 = 9).4

So in our example, we would have 50/10 = 5 if section D represents a population and 50/9 =
about 5.56 if section D represents a sample. These values (5 and 5.56) are called,
respectively, the population variance and the sample variance for section D.

Variance can be a useful statistical concept, but note that the units of variance in this instance
would be points-squared since we squared all of the deviations. What are points-
squared? Good question. We would rather deal with the units we started with (points in this
case), so to convert back we take the square root and get:

                                         50
population standard deviatio=n = 5  2.2

                                         10

or

sample standard deviat= ion  50  2.4
                             9

If we are unsure whether the data set is a sample or a population, we will usually assume it is
a sample, and we will round answers to one more decimal place than the original data, as we
have done above.

To compute standard deviation:
1. Find the deviation of each data from the mean. In other words, subtract the mean

    from the data value.
2. Square each deviation.
3. Add the squared deviations.
4. Divide by n, the number of data values, if the data represents a whole population;

    divide by n - 1 if the data is from a sample.
5. Compute the square root of the result.

4 The reason we do this is highly technical, but we can see how it might be useful by considering the case of a
small sample from a population that contains an outlier, which would increase the average deviation: the outlier
very likely won't be included in the sample, so the mean deviation of the sample would underestimate the mean
deviation of the population; thus we divide by a slightly smaller number to get a slightly bigger average
deviation.
266

Example 24
     Computing the standard deviation for Section B above, we first calculate that the mean is 5.
     Using a table can help keep track of your computations for the standard deviation:

     data value  deviation: data value - mean  deviation squared
     0           0-5 = -5                      (-5)2 = 25
     0           0-5 = -5                      (-5)2 = 25
     0           0-5 = -5                      (-5)2 = 25
     0           0-5 = -5                      (-5)2 = 25
     0           0-5 = -5                      (-5)2 = 25
     10          10-5 = 5                      (5)2 = 25
     10          10-5 = 5                      (5)2 = 25
     10          10-5 = 5                      (5)2 = 25
     10          10-5 = 5                      (5)2 = 25
     10          10-5 = 5                      (5)2 = 25

Assuming this data represents a population, we will add the squared deviations, divide by 10,
the number of data values, and compute the square root:

25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 250
                                      = =5
                 10                            10

Notice that the standard deviation of this data set is much larger than that of section D since
the data in this set is more spread out.

For comparison, the standard deviations of all four sections are:

     Section A: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5            Standard deviation: 0

     Section B: 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 10       Standard deviation: 5

     Section C: 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6            Standard deviation: 0.8

     Section D: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 10           Standard deviation: 2.2

Where standard deviation is a measure of variation based on the mean, quartiles are based
on the median.

   Quartiles
   Quartiles are values that divide the data in quarters.

   The first quartile (Q1) is the value so that 25% of the data values are below it; the third
   quartile (Q3) is the value so that 75% of the data values are below it. You may have
   guessed that the second quartile is the same as the median, since the median is the
   value so that 50% of the data values are below it.

   This divides the data into quarters; 25% of the data is between the minimum and Q1,
   25% is between Q1 and the median, 25% is between the median and Q3, and 25% is
   between Q3 and the maximum value

While quartiles are not a 1-number summary of variation like standard deviation, the
quartiles are used with the median, minimum, and maximum values to form a 5 number
summary of the data.

   Five number summary
   The five number summary takes this form:
   Minimum, Q1, Median, Q3, Maximum

To find the first quartile, we need to find the data value so that 25% of the data is below it. If
n is the number of data values, we compute a locator by finding 25% of n. If this locator is a
decimal value, we round up, and find the data value in that position. If the locator is a whole
number, we find the mean of the data value in that position and the next data value. This is
identical to the process we used to find the median, except we use 25% of the data values
rather than half the data values as the locator.

   To find the first quartile, Q1
   Begin by ordering the data from smallest to largest
   Compute the locator: L = 0.25n
   If L is a decimal value:

         Round up to L+
         Use the data value in the L+th position
   If L is a whole number:
         Find the mean of the data values in the Lth and L+1th positions.

   To find the third quartile, Q3
   Use the same procedure as for Q1, but with locator: L = 0.75n

Examples should help make this clearer.
     268

Example 25
     Suppose we have measured 9 females and their heights (in inches), sorted from smallest to
     largest are:

              59 60 62 64 66 67 69 70 72

     To find the first quartile we first compute the locator: 25% of 9 is L = 0.25(9) = 2.25. Since
     this value is not a whole number, we round up to 3. The first quartile will be the third data
     value: 62 inches.

     To find the third quartile, we again compute the locator: 75% of 9 is 0.75(9) = 6.75. Since
     this value is not a whole number, we round up to 7. The third quartile will be the seventh
     data value: 69 inches.

Example 26
     Suppose we had measured 8 females and their heights (in inches), sorted from smallest to
     largest are:

              59 60 62 64 66 67 69 70

     To find the first quartile we first compute the locator: 25% of 8 is L = 0.25(8) = 2. Since this
     value is a whole number, we will find the mean of the 2nd and 3rd data values: (60+62)/2 =
     61, so the first quartile is 61 inches.

     The third quartile is computed similarly, using 75% instead of 25%. L = 0.75(8) = 6. This is
     a whole number, so we will find the mean of the 6th and 7th data values: (67+69)/2 = 68, so
     Q3 is 68.

     Note that the median could be computed the same way, using 50%.

     The 5-number summary combines the first and third quartile with the minimum, median, and
     maximum values.

Example 27
     For the 9 female sample, the median is 66, the minimum is 59, and the maximum is 72. The
     5 number summary is: 59, 62, 66, 69, 72.

     For the 8 female sample, the median is 65, the minimum is 59, and the maximum is 70, so
     the 5 number summary would be: 59, 61, 65, 68, 70.

     Returning to our quiz score data. In each case, the first quartile locator is 0.25(10) = 2.5, so

minimum income is $15 thousand, and the maximum is $50 thousand.

To find Q1, we calculate the locator: L = 0.25(100) = 25. This is a whole number, so Q1 will
be the mean of the 25th and 26th data values.

There are 6 data values of $15, so   Values 1 to 6 are $15 thousand
The next 8 data values are $20, so   Values 7 to (6+8)=14 are $20 thousand
The next 11 data values are $25, so  Values 15 to (14+11)=25 are $25 thousand
The next 17 data values are $30, so  Values 26 to (25+17)=42 are $30 thousand

The 25th data value is $25 thousand, and the 26th data value is $30 thousand, so Q1 will be the
mean of these: (25 + 30)/2 = $27.5 thousand.

To find Q3, we calculate the locator: L = 0.75(100) = 75. This is a whole number, so Q3 will

be the mean of the 75th and 76th data values. Continuing our counting from earlier,

The next 19 data values are $35, so  Values 43 to (42+19)=61 are $35 thousand

The next 20 data values are $40, so  Values 61 to (61+20)=81 are $40 thousand

Both the 75th and 76th data values lie in this group, so Q3 will be $40 thousand.

Putting these values together into a five-number summary, we get: 15, 27.5, 35, 40, 50

Note that the 5 number summary divides the data into four intervals, each of which will
contain about 25% of the data. In the previous example, that means about 25% of
households have income between $40 thousand and $50 thousand.

For visualizing data, there is a graphical representation of a 5-number summary called a box
plot, or box and whisker graph.

   Box plot
   A box plot is a graphical representation of a five-number summary.

   To create a box plot, a number line is first drawn. A box is drawn from the first
   quartile to the third quartile, and a line is drawn through the box at the median.
   "Whiskers" are extended out to the minimum and maximum values.

Example 30
     The box plot below is based on the 9 female height data with 5 number summary:
     59, 62, 66, 69, 72.

     Box plots are particularly useful for comparing data from two populations.
Example 32
     The box plot of service times for two fast-food restaurants is shown below.

     While store 2 had a slightly shorter median service time (2.1 minutes vs. 2.3 minutes), store 2
     is less consistent, with a wider spread of the data.
     At store 1, 75% of customers were served within 2.9 minutes, while at store 2, 75% of
     customers were served within 5.7 minutes.
     Which store should you go to in a hurry? That depends upon your opinions about luck -
     25% of customers at store 2 had to wait between 5.7 and 9.6 minutes.

Example 33

     The boxplot below is based on the birth weights of infants with severe idiopathic respiratory
     distress syndrome (SIRDS)5. The boxplot is separated to show the birth weights of infants
     who survived and those that did not.
     Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died
     appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived. In fact, we can see
     that the median birth weight of infants that survived is the same as the third quartile of the
     infants that died.
     Similarly, we can see that the first quartile of the survivors is larger than the median weight
     of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the
     median birth weight of those that died.
     Looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we
     can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that
     died.
     The box plot gives us a quick, albeit informal, way to determine that birth weight is quite
     likely linked to survival of infants with SIRDS.

2. While the pie chart accurately depicts the relative size of the people agreeing with each
   candidate, the chart is confusing, since usually percents on a pie chart represent the
   percentage of the pie the slice represents.

3. Using a class intervals of size 55, we can group our data into six intervals:

Cost interval Frequency

$140-194                                     5

$195-249                                     3

$250-304                                     9

$305-359                                     12

$360-414                                     4

$415-469                                     3

We can use the frequency distribution to generate the histogram

4. Adding the prices and dividing by 5 we get the mean price: $3.682

5. First we put the data in order: $3.29, $3.59, $3.75, $3.79, $3.99. Since there are an odd
   number of data, the median will be the middle value, $3.75.

6. There are 23 ratings.

   a. The mean is 1 4 + 2  8 + 3  7 + 4  3 + 5 1  2.5
                                     23

   b. There are 23 data values, so the median will be the 12th data value. Ratings of 1 are the
      first 4 values, while a rating of 2 are the next 8 values, so the 12th value will be a rating
      of 2. The median is 2.

   c. The mode is the most frequent rating. The mode rating is 2.
274

7. Earlier we found the mean of the data was $3.682.

     data value  deviation: data value - mean  deviation squared
     3.29        3.29 - 3.682 = -0.391         0.153664
     3.59        3.59 - 3.682 = -0.092         0.008464
     3.79        3.79 - 3.682 = 0.108          0.011664
     3.75        3.75 - 3.682 = 0.068          0.004624
     3.99        3.99 - 3.682 = 0.308          0.094864

This data is from a sample, so we will add the squared deviations, divide by 4, the
number of data values minus 1, and compute the square root:

     0.153664 + 0.008464 + 0.011664 + 0.004624 + 0.094864  $0.261
                                      4

8. The data is already in order, so we don't need to sort it first.
   The minimum value is $140 and the maximum is $460.

   There are 36 data values so n = 36. n/2 = 18, which is a whole number, so the median is
   the mean of the 18th and 19th data values, $305 and $310. The median is $307.50.

   To find the first quartile, we calculate the locator, L = 0.25(36) = 9. Since this is a whole
   number, we know Q1 is the mean of the 9th and 10th data values, $250 and $260. Q1 =
   $255.

   To find the third quartile, we calculate the locator, L = 0.75(36) = 27. Since this is a
   whole number, we know Q3 is the mean of the 27th and 28th data values, $345 and $350.
   Q3 = $347.50.

   The 5 number summary of this data is: $140, $255, $307.50, $347.50, $460

Probability

 Introduction
     The probability of a specified event is the chance or likelihood that it will occur. There are
     several ways of viewing probability. One would be experimental in nature, where we
     repeatedly conduct an experiment. Suppose we flipped a coin over and over and over again
     and it came up heads about half of the time; we would expect that in the future whenever we
     flipped the coin it would turn up heads about half of the time. When a weather reporter says
     "there is a 10% chance of rain tomorrow," she is basing that on prior evidence; that out of all
     days with similar weather patterns, it has rained on 1 out of 10 of those days.

     Another view would be subjective in nature, in other words an educated guess. If someone
     asked you the probability that the Seattle Mariners would win their next baseball game, it
     would be impossible to conduct an experiment where the same two teams played each other
     repeatedly, each time with the same starting lineup and starting pitchers, each starting at the
     same time of day on the same field under the precisely the same conditions. Since there are
     so many variables to take into account, someone familiar with baseball and with the two
     teams involved might make an educated guess that there is a 75% chance they will win the
     game; that is, if the same two teams were to play each other repeatedly under identical
     conditions, the Mariners would win about three out of every four games. But this is just a
     guess, with no way to verify its accuracy, and depending upon how educated the educated
     guesser is, a subjective probability may not be worth very much.

     We will return to the experimental and subjective probabilities from time to time, but in this
     course we will mostly be concerned with theoretical probability, which is defined as
     follows: Suppose there is a situation with n equally likely possible outcomes and that m of
     those n outcomes correspond to a particular event; then the probability of that event is
     defined as m .

                   n

 Basic Concepts
     If you roll a die, pick a card from deck of playing cards, or randomly select a person and
     observe their hair color, we are executing an experiment or procedure. In probability, we
     look at the likelihood of different outcomes. We begin with some terminology.

         Events and Outcomes
         The result of an experiment is called an outcome.

         An event is any particular outcome or group of outcomes.

         A simple event is an event that cannot be broken down further

         The sample space is the set of all possible simple events.

     If we roll a standard 6-sided die, describe the sample space and some simple events.

The sample space is the set of all possible simple events: {1,2,3,4,5,6}

Some examples of simple events:
We roll a 1
We roll a 5

Some compound events:            Two dice                                 One die
We roll a number bigger than 4
We roll an even number

Basic Probability
Given that all outcomes are equally likely, we can compute the probability of an event
E using this formula:
P(E) = Number of outcomes corresponding to the event E

               Total number of equally - likely outcomes

Example 2
     If we roll a 6-sided die, calculate
     a) P(rolling a 1)
     b) P(rolling a number bigger than 4)

     Recall that the sample space is {1,2,3,4,5,6}
     a) There is one outcome corresponding to "rolling a 1", so the probability is 1

                                                                                                  6
     b) There are two outcomes bigger than a 4, so the probability is 2 = 1

                                                                                   63

     Probabilities are essentially fractions, and can be reduced to lower terms like fractions.

Example 3
     Let's say you have a bag with 20 cherries, 14 sweet and 6 sour. If you pick a cherry at
     random, what is the probability that it will be sweet?

     There are 20 possible cherries that could be picked, so the number of possible outcomes is
     20. Of these 20 possible outcomes, 14 are favorable (sweet), so the probability that the cherry
     will be sweet is 14 = 7 .

                         20 10
                                                                                              Probability 281

     There is one potential complication to this example, however. It must be assumed that the
     probability of picking any of the cherries is the same as the probability of picking any other.
     This wouldn't be true if (let us imagine) the sweet cherries are smaller than the sour ones.
     (The sour cherries would come to hand more readily when you sampled from the bag.) Let us
     keep in mind, therefore, that when we assess probabilities in terms of the ratio of favorable to
     all potential cases, we rely heavily on the assumption of equal probability for all outcomes.

     Try it Now 1
     At some random moment, you look at your clock and note the minutes reading.
     a. What is probability the minutes reading is 15?
     b. What is the probability the minutes reading is 15 or less?

         Cards
         A standard deck of 52 playing cards consists of four suits (hearts, spades, diamonds
         and clubs). Spades and clubs are black while hearts and diamonds are red. Each suit
         contains 13 cards, each of a different rank: an Ace (which in many games functions as
         both a low card and a high card), cards numbered 2 through 10, a Jack, a Queen and a
         King.

Example 4
     Compute the probability of randomly drawing one card from a deck and getting an Ace.

     There are 52 cards in the deck and 4 Aces so P( Ace) = 4 = 1  0.0769
                                                                         52 13

     We can also think of probabilities as percents: There is a 7.69% chance that a randomly
     selected card will be an Ace.

     Notice that the smallest possible probability is 0 - if there are no outcomes that correspond
     with the event. The largest possible probability is 1 - if all possible outcomes correspond
     with the event.

         Certain and Impossible events
         An impossible event has a probability of 0.
         A certain event has a probability of 1.
         The probability of any event must be 0  P(E)  1

     In the course of this chapter, if you compute a probability and get an answer that is negative
     or greater than 1, you have made a mistake and should check your work.

Working with Events

   Complementary Events
   Now let us examine the probability that an event does not happen. As in the previous section,
   consider the situation of rolling a six-sided die and first compute the probability of rolling a
   six: the answer is P(six) =1/6. Now consider the probability that we do not roll a six: there
   are 5 outcomes that are not a six, so the answer is P(not a six) = 5 . Notice that

                                                                                  6
    P(six) + P(not a six) = 1 + 5 = 6 = 1

                                66 6

This is not a coincidence. Consider a generic situation with n possible outcomes and an

event E that corresponds to m of these outcomes. Then the remaining n - m outcomes

correspond to E not happening, thus

P(not E) = n - m = n - m = 1- m = 1- P(E)
     n nn  n

Complement of an Event                                           1- P(E)
The complement of an event is the event "E doesn't happen"
The notation E is used for the complement of event E.

We can compute the probability of the complement using P ( E )=

Notice also that P(E)= 1- P ( E )

Example 5
     If you pull a random card from a deck of playing cards, what is the probability it is not a
     heart?

     There are 13 hearts in the deck, so P(heart) = 13 = 1 .
                                                             52 4

     The probability of not drawing a heart is the complement:
      P(not heart) = 1- P(heart) = 1- 1 = 3

                                            44

     Probability of two independent events

Example 6
     Suppose we flipped a coin and rolled a die, and wanted to know the probability of getting a
     head on the coin and a 6 on the die.

     We could list all possible outcomes: {H1,H2,H3,H4,H5,H6,T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6}.
                                                                                              Probability 283

     Notice there are 2 · 6 = 12 total outcomes. Out of these, only 1 is the desired outcome, so the
     probability is 1 .

                      12

     The prior example was looking at two independent events.

         Independent Events
         Events A and B are independent events if the probability of Event B occurring is the
         same whether or not Event A occurs.

Example 7
     Are these events independent?
     a) A fair coin is tossed two times. The two events are (1) first toss is a head and (2) second
     toss is a head.

     b) The two events (1) "It will rain tomorrow in Houston" and (2) "It will rain tomorrow in
     Galveston" (a city near Houston).

     c) You draw a card from a deck, then draw a second card without replacing the first.

     a) The probability that a head comes up on the second toss is 1/2 regardless of whether or not
     a head came up on the first toss, so these events are independent.

     b) These events are not independent because it is more likely that it will rain in Galveston on
     days it rains in Houston than on days it does not.

     c) The probability of the second card being red depends on whether the first card is red or
     not, so these events are not independent.

     When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the
     probabilities of the individual events.

         P(A and B) for independent events
         If events A and B are independent, then the probability of both A and B occurring is

         P(A and B) = P(A) · P(B)

         where P(A and B) is the probability of events A and B both occurring, P(A) is the
         probability of event A occurring, and P(B) is the probability of event B occurring

     If you look back at the coin and die example from earlier, you can see how the number of
     outcomes of the first event multiplied by the number of outcomes in the second event
     multiplied to equal the total number of possible outcomes in the combined event.

Example 8
     In your drawer you have 10 pairs of socks, 6 of which are white, and 7 tee shirts, 3 of which
     are white. If you randomly reach in and pull out a pair of socks and a tee shirt, what is the
     probability both are white?

     The probability of choosing a white pair of socks is 6 .
                                                                     10

     The probability of choosing a white tee shirt is 3 .
                                                               7

     The probability of both being white is 6  3 = 18 = 9

Try it Now 2
A card is pulled a deck of cards and noted. The card is then replaced, the deck is shuffled,
and a second card is removed and noted. What is the probability that both cards are Aces?

The previous examples looked at the probability of both events occurring. Now we will look
at the probability of either event occurring.

Example 9
     Suppose we flipped a coin and rolled a die, and wanted to know the probability of getting a
     head on the coin or a 6 on the die.

Here, there are still 12 possible outcomes: {H1,H2,H3,H4,H5,H6,T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6}

By simply counting, we can see that 7 of the outcomes have a head on the coin or a 6 on the
die or both - we use or inclusively here (these 7 outcomes are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, T6),
so the probability is 7 . How could we have found this from the individual probabilities?

                         12

As we would expect, 1 of these outcomes have a head, and 1 of these outcomes have a 6
2  6

on the die. If we add these, 1 + 1 = 6 + 2 = 8 , which is not the correct probability.
                                  2 6 12 12 12

Looking at the outcomes we can see why: the outcome H6 would have been counted twice,

since it contains both a head and a 6; the probability of both a head and rolling a 6 is 1 .
                                                                                                       12

If we subtract out this double count, we have the correct probability: 8 - 1 = 7 .
                                                                                    12 12 12
                                                         Probability 285

P(A or B)
The probability of either A or B occurring (or both) is

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Example 10
     Suppose we draw one card from a standard deck. What is the probability that we get a Queen
     or a King?

There are 4 Queens and 4 Kings in the deck, hence 8 outcomes corresponding to a Queen or
King out of 52 possible outcomes. Thus the probability of drawing a Queen or a King is:
P(King or Queen) = 8

                         52

Note that in this case, there are no cards that are both a Queen and a King, so
P(King and Queen) = 0 . Using our probability rule, we could have said:

P(King or Queen) = P(King) + P(Queen) - P(King and Queen) = 4 + 4 - 0 = 8
                                                         52 52                   52

In the last example, the events were mutually exclusive, so P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B).

Example 11
     Suppose we draw one card from a standard deck. What is the probability that we get a red
     card or a King?

     Half the cards are red, so P(red) = 26
                                                52

     There are four kings, so P(King) = 4
                                                 52

     There are two red kings, so P(Red and King) = 2
                                                               52

     We can then calculate
      P(Red or King) = P(Red) + P(King) - P(Red and King) = 26 + 4 - 2 = 28

                                                                            52 52 52 52

Example 12

     The table below shows the number of survey subjects who have received and not received a
     speeding ticket in the last year, and the color of their car. Find the probability that a
     randomly chosen person:
     a) Has a red car and got a speeding ticket
     b) Has a red car or got a speeding ticket.

Red car      Speeding  No speeding  Total
Not red car  ticket    ticket
Total        15        135          150
             45        470          515
             60        605          665

We can see that 15 people of the 665 surveyed had both a red car and got a speeding ticket,
so the probability is 15  0.0226 .

                         665

Notice that having a red car and getting a speeding ticket are not independent events, so the
probability of both of them occurring is not simply the product of probabilities of each one
occurring.

We could answer this question by simply adding up the numbers: 15 people with red cars
and speeding tickets + 135 with red cars but no ticket + 45 with a ticket but no red car = 195
people. So the probability is 195  0.2932 .

                                    665

We also could have found this probability by:
P(had a red car) + P(got a speeding ticket) - P(had a red car and got a speeding ticket)
= 150 + 60 - 15 = 195 .

   665 665 665 665

     Conditional Probability
     Often it is required to compute the probability of an event given that another event has
     occurred.

Example 13
     What is the probability that two cards drawn at random from a deck of playing cards will
     both be aces?

     It might seem that you could use the formula for the probability of two independent events
     and simply multiply 4  4 = 1 . This would be incorrect, however, because the two

                               52 52 169
     events are not independent. If the first card drawn is an ace, then the probability that the
     second card is also an ace would be lower because there would only be three aces left in the
     deck.
                                                                                        Probability 287

Once the first card chosen is an ace, the probability that the second card chosen is also an ace
is called the conditional probability of drawing an ace. In this case the "condition" is that
the first card is an ace. Symbolically, we write this as:
P(ace on second draw | an ace on the first draw).

The vertical bar "|" is read as "given," so the above expression is short for "The probability
that an ace is drawn on the second draw given that an ace was drawn on the first draw." What
is this probability? After an ace is drawn on the first draw, there are 3 aces out of 51 total
cards left. This means that the conditional probability of drawing an ace after one ace has
already been drawn is 3 = 1 .

                           51 17
                                                            4 3 12 1

Thus, the probability of both cards being aces is  = = .

Conditional Probability
The probability the event B occurs, given that event A has happened, is represented as
P(B | A)
This is read as "the probability of B given A"

Example 14
     Find the probability that a die rolled shows a 6, given that a flipped coin shows a head.

     These are two independent events, so the probability of the die rolling a 6 is 1 , regardless of
                                                                                                   6

     the result of the coin flip.

Example 15

     The table below shows the number of survey subjects who have received and not received a
     speeding ticket in the last year, and the color of their car. Find the probability that a
     randomly chosen person:

     b) Has a red car given they have a speeding ticket

Red car      Speeding  No speeding  Total

             60        605          665

a) Since we know the person has a red car, we are only considering the 150 people in the first
   row of the table. Of those, 15 have a speeding ticket, so
   P(ticket | red car) = 15 = 1 = 0.1
                            150 10

     b) Since we know the person has a speeding ticket, we are only considering the 60 people in
        the first column of the table. Of those, 15 have a red car, so
         P(red car | ticket) = 15 = 1 = 0.25 .
                                  60 4

     Notice from the last example that P(B | A) is not equal to P(A | B).

     These kinds of conditional probabilities are what insurance companies use to determine your
     insurance rates. They look at the conditional probability of you having accident, given your
     age, your car, your car color, your driving history, etc., and price your policy based on that
     likelihood.

         Conditional Probability Formula
         If Events A and B are not independent, then
         P(A and B) = P(A) · P(B | A)

Example 16
     If you pull 2 cards out of a deck, what is the probability that both are spades?

     The probability that the first card is a spade is 13 .
                                                              52

     The probability that the second card is a spade, given the first was a spade, is 12 , since there
                                                                                                    51

     is one less spade in the deck, and one less total cards.

     The probability that both cards are spades is 13 12 = 156  0.0588
                                                            52 51 2652

Example 17
     If you draw two cards from a deck, what is the probability that you will get the Ace of
     Diamonds and a black card?

     You can satisfy this condition by having Case A or Case B, as follows:
     Case A) you can get the Ace of Diamonds first and then a black card or
     Case B) you can get a black card first and then the Ace of Diamonds.

     Let's calculate the probability of Case A. The probability that the first card is the Ace of
     Diamonds is 1 . The probability that the second card is black given that the first card is the

                      52
     Ace of Diamonds is 26 because 26 of the remaining 51 cards are black. The probability is

                               51
     therefore 1  26 = 1 .

                 52 51 102

Now for Case B: the probability that the first card is black is 26 = 1 . The probability that the

second card is the Ace of Diamonds given that the first card is black is 1 . The probability

Recall that the probability of A or B is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). In this problem, P(A and
B) = 0 since the first card cannot be the Ace of Diamonds and be a black card. Therefore, the
probability of Case A or Case B is 1 + 1 = 2 = 1 . The probability that you will get

     A home pregnancy test was given to women, then pregnancy was verified through blood
     tests. The following table shows the home pregnancy test results. Find

a) Since we know the test result was positive, we're limited to the 75 women in the first
   column, of which 5 were not pregnant. P(not pregnant | positive test result) = 5  0.067 .
                                                                                                   75

b) Since we know the woman is not pregnant, we are limited to the 19 women in the second
   row, of which 5 had a positive test. P(positive test result | not pregnant) = 5  0.263

The second result is what is usually called a false positive: A positive result when the
woman is not actually pregnant.

 Bayes Theorem
     In this section we concentrate on the more complex conditional probability problems we
     began looking at in the last section.

Example 19
     Suppose a certain disease has an incidence rate of 0.1% (that is, it afflicts 0.1% of the
     population). A test has been devised to detect this disease. The test does not produce false
     negatives (that is, anyone who has the disease will test positive for it), but the false positive
     rate is 5% (that is, about 5% of people who take the test will test positive, even though they
     do not have the disease). Suppose a randomly selected person takes the test and tests
     positive. What is the probability that this person actually has the disease?

     There are two ways to approach the solution to this problem. One involves an important
     result in probability theory called Bayes' theorem. We will discuss this theorem a bit later,
     but for now we will use an alternative and, we hope, much more intuitive approach.

     Let's break down the information in the problem piece by piece.

     Suppose a certain disease has an incidence rate of 0.1% (that is, it afflicts 0.1% of the
     population). The percentage 0.1% can be converted to a decimal number by moving the
     decimal place two places to the left, to get 0.001. In turn, 0.001 can be rewritten as a
     fraction: 1/1000. This tells us that about 1 in every 1000 people has the disease. (If we
     wanted we could write P(disease)=0.001.)

     A test has been devised to detect this disease. The test does not produce false negatives (that
     is, anyone who has the disease will test positive for it). This part is fairly straightforward:
     everyone who has the disease will test positive, or alternatively everyone who tests negative
     does not have the disease. (We could also say P(positive | disease)=1.)

     The false positive rate is 5% (that is, about 5% of people who take the test will test positive,
     even though they do not have the disease). This is even more straightforward. Another way
     of looking at it is that of every 100 people who are tested and do not have the disease, 5 will
     test positive even though they do not have the disease. (We could also say that P(positive |
     no disease)=0.05.)

     Suppose a randomly selected person takes the test and tests positive. What is the probability
     that this person actually has the disease? Here we want to compute P(disease|positive). We
     already know that P(positive|disease)=1, but remember that conditional probabilities are not
     equal if the conditions are switched.
     Rather than thinking in terms of all these probabilities we have developed, let's create a
     hypothetical situation and apply the facts as set out above. First, suppose we randomly select
     1000 people and administer the test. How many do we expect to have the disease? Since
     about 1/1000 of all people are afflicted with the disease, 1/1000 of 1000 people is 1. (Now
     you know why we chose 1000.) Only 1 of 1000 test subjects actually has the disease; the
     other 999 do not.
                                                                                        Probability 291

We also know that 5% of all people who do not have the disease will test positive. There are
999 disease-free people, so we would expect (0.05)(999)=49.95 (so, about 50) people to test
positive who do not have the disease.

Now back to the original question, computing P(disease|positive). There are 51 people who
test positive in our example (the one unfortunate person who actually has the disease, plus
the 50 people who tested positive but don't). Only one of these people has the disease, so

P(disease | positive)  1  0.0196
                            51

or less than 2%. Does this surprise you? This means that of all people who test positive,
over 98% do not have the disease.

The answer we got was slightly approximate, since we rounded 49.95 to 50. We could redo
the problem with 100,000 test subjects, 100 of whom would have the disease and
(0.05)(99,900)=4995 test positive but do not have the disease, so the exact probability of
having the disease if you test positive is
P(disease | positive)  100  0.0196

                            5095
which is pretty much the same answer.

But back to the surprising result. Of all people who test positive, over 98% do not have the
disease. If your guess for the probability a person who tests positive has the disease was
wildly different from the right answer (2%), don't feel bad. The exact same problem was
posed to doctors and medical students at the Harvard Medical School 25 years ago and the
results revealed in a 1978 New England Journal of Medicine article. Only about 18% of the
participants got the right answer. Most of the rest thought the answer was closer to 95%
(perhaps they were misled by the false positive rate of 5%).

So at least you should feel a little better that a bunch of doctors didn't get the right answer
either (assuming you thought the answer was much higher). But the significance of this
finding and similar results from other studies in the intervening years lies not in making math
students feel better but in the possibly catastrophic consequences it might have for patient
care. If a doctor thinks the chances that a positive test result nearly guarantees that a patient
has a disease, they might begin an unnecessary and possibly harmful treatment regimen on a
healthy patient. Or worse, as in the early days of the AIDS crisis when being HIV-positive
was often equated with a death sentence, the patient might take a drastic action and commit
suicide.

As we have seen in this hypothetical example, the most responsible course of action for
treating a patient who tests positive would be to counsel the patient that they most likely do
not have the disease and to order further, more reliable, tests to verify the diagnosis.

One of the reasons that the doctors and medical students in the study did so poorly is that
such problems, when presented in the types of statistics courses that medical students often
take, are solved by use of Bayes' theorem, which is stated as follows:
292

Bayes' Theorem

P(A | B) =               P( A)P(B | A)

            P( A)P(B | A) + P( A)P(B | A)

In our earlier example, this translates to

P(disease | positive) =                     P(disease)P(positive | disease)

                         P(disease)P(positive | disease) + P(no disease)P(positive | no disease)

Plugging in the numbers gives

P(disease | positive) =        (0.001)(1)             0.0196

                         (0.001)(1) + (0.999)(0.05)

which is exactly the same answer as our original solution.

The problem is that you (or the typical medical student, or even the typical math professor)
are much more likely to be able to remember the original solution than to remember Bayes'
theorem. Psychologists, such as Gerd Gigerenzer, author of Calculated Risks: How to Know
When Numbers Deceive You, have advocated that the method involved in the original
solution (which Gigerenzer calls the method of "natural frequencies") be employed in place
of Bayes' Theorem. Gigerenzer performed a study and found that those educated in the
natural frequency method were able to recall it far longer than those who were taught Bayes'
theorem. When one considers the possible life-and-death consequences associated with such
calculations it seems wise to heed his advice.

Example 20

     A certain disease has an incidence rate of 2%. If the false negative rate is 10% and the false
     positive rate is 1%, compute the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the
     disease.

Imagine 10,000 people who are tested. Of these 10,000, 200 will have the disease; 10% of
them, or 20, will test negative and the remaining 180 will test positive. Of the 9800 who do
not have the disease, 98 will test positive. So of the 278 total people who test positive, 180
will have the disease. Thus
P(disease | positive) = 180  0.647

                            278
so about 65% of the people who test positive will have the disease.

Using Bayes theorem directly would give the same result:

P(disease | positive) =  (0.02)(0.90)                = 0.018  0.647

                         (0.02)(0.90) + (0.98)(0.01) 0.0278
                                                                           Probability 293

Try it Now 5
A certain disease has an incidence rate of 0.5%. If there are no false negatives and if the false
positive rate is 3%, compute the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the
disease.

Counting
   Counting? You already know how to count or you wouldn't be taking a college-level math
   class, right? Well yes, but what we'll really be investigating here are ways of counting
   efficiently. When we get to the probability situations a bit later in this chapter we will need
   to count some very large numbers, like the number of possible winning lottery tickets. One
   way to do this would be to write down every possible set of numbers that might show up on a
   lottery ticket, but believe me: you don't want to do this.

Basic Counting

We will start, however, with some more reasonable sorts of counting problems in order to
develop the ideas that we will soon need.

Example 21

     Suppose at a particular restaurant you have three choices for an appetizer (soup, salad or
     breadsticks) and five choices for a main course (hamburger, sandwich, quiche, fajita or
     pizza). If you are allowed to choose exactly one item from each category for your meal, how
     many different meal options do you have?

Solution 1: One way to solve this problem would be to systematically list each possible

meal:

soup + hamburger             soup + sandwich               soup + quiche

soup + fajita                soup + pizza                  salad + hamburger

salad + sandwich             salad + quiche                salad + fajita

salad + pizza                breadsticks + hamburger breadsticks + sandwich

breadsticks + quiche         breadsticks + fajita          breadsticks + pizza

Assuming that we did this systematically and that we neither missed any possibilities nor
listed any possibility more than once, the answer would be 15. Thus you could go to the
restaurant 15 nights in a row and have a different meal each night.

Solution 2: Another way to solve this problem would be to list all the possibilities in a table:

               hamburger     sandwich  quiche      fajita  pizza
               soup+burger
soup           salad+burger
salad          etc.
bread

In each of the cells in the table we could list the corresponding meal: soup + hamburger in
the upper left corner, salad + hamburger below it, etc. But if we didn't really care what the
possible meals are, only how many possible meals there are, we could just count the number
294

of cells and arrive at an answer of 15, which matches our answer from the first solution. (It's
always good when you solve a problem two different ways and get the same answer!)
Solution 3: We already have two perfectly good solutions. Why do we need a third? The
first method was not very systematic, and we might easily have made an omission. The
second method was better, but suppose that in addition to the appetizer and the main course
we further complicated the problem by adding desserts to the menu: we've used the rows of
the table for the appetizers and the columns for the main courses--where will the desserts
go? We would need a third dimension, and since drawing 3-D tables on a 2-D page or
computer screen isn't terribly easy, we need a better way in case we have three categories to
choose form instead of just two.
So, back to the problem in the example. What else can we do? Let's draw a tree diagram:

This is called a "tree" diagram because at each stage we branch out, like the branches on a
tree. In this case, we first drew five branches (one for each main course) and then for each of
those branches we drew three more branches (one for each appetizer). We count the number
of branches at the final level and get (surprise, surprise!) 15.
If we wanted, we could instead draw three branches at the first stage for the three appetizers
and then five branches (one for each main course) branching out of each of those three
branches.

OK, so now we know how to count possibilities using tables and tree diagrams. These
methods will continue to be useful in certain cases, but imagine a game where you have two
decks of cards (with 52 cards in each deck) and you select one card from each deck. Would
you really want to draw a table or tree diagram to determine the number of outcomes of this
game?
                                                                                              Probability 295

     Let's go back to the previous example that involved selecting a meal from three appetizers
     and five main courses, and look at the second solution that used a table. Notice that one way
     to count the number of possible meals is simply to number each of the appropriate cells in the
     table, as we have done above. But another way to count the number of cells in the table
     would be multiply the number of rows (3) by the number of columns (5) to get 15. Notice
     that we could have arrived at the same result without making a table at all by simply
     multiplying the number of choices for the appetizer (3) by the number of choices for the main
     course (5). We generalize this technique as the basic counting rule:

         Basic Counting Rule
         If we are asked to choose one item from each of two separate categories where there
         are m items in the first category and n items in the second category, then the total
         number of available choices is m · n.

         This is sometimes called the multiplication rule for probabilities.

Example 22
     There are 21 novels and 18 volumes of poetry on a reading list for a college English course.
     How many different ways can a student select one novel and one volume of poetry to read
     during the quarter?

     There are 21 choices from the first category and 18 for the second, so there are 21 · 18 = 378
     possibilities.

     The Basic Counting Rule can be extended when there are more than two categories by
     applying it repeatedly, as we see in the next example.

Example 23
     Suppose at a particular restaurant you have three choices for an appetizer (soup, salad or
     breadsticks), five choices for a main course (hamburger, sandwich, quiche, fajita or pasta)
     and two choices for dessert (pie or ice cream). If you are allowed to choose exactly one item
     from each category for your meal, how many different meal options do you have?

     There are 3 choices for an appetizer, 5 for the main course and 2 for dessert, so there are
     3 · 5 · 2 = 30 possibilities.

Example 24
     A quiz consists of 3 true-or-false questions. In how many ways can a student answer the
     quiz?

     There are 3 questions. Each question has 2 possible answers (true or false), so the quiz may
     be answered in 2 · 2 · 2 = 8 different ways. Recall that another way to write 2 · 2 · 2 is 23,
     which is much more compact.
     296

     Try it Now 6
     Suppose at a particular restaurant you have eight choices for an appetizer, eleven choices for
     a main course and five choices for dessert. If you are allowed to choose exactly one item
     from each category for your meal, how many different meal options do you have?

     Permutations
     In this section we will develop an even faster way to solve some of the problems we have
     already learned to solve by other means. Let's start with a couple examples.

Example 25
     How many different ways can the letters of the word MATH be rearranged to form a four-
     letter code word?

     This problem is a bit different. Instead of choosing one item from each of several different
     categories, we are repeatedly choosing items from the same category (the category is: the
     letters of the word MATH) and each time we choose an item we do not replace it, so there is
     one fewer choice at the next stage: we have 4 choices for the first letter (say we choose A),
     then 3 choices for the second (M, T and H; say we choose H), then 2 choices for the next
     letter (M and T; say we choose M) and only one choice at the last stage (T). Thus there are 4
     · 3 · 2 · 1 = 24 ways to spell a code worth with the letters MATH.

     In this example, we needed to calculate n · (n - 1) · (n - 2) ··· 3 · 2 · 1. This calculation
     shows up often in mathematics, and is called the factorial, and is notated n!

         Factorial
         n! = n · (n - 1) · (n - 2) ··· 3 · 2 · 1

Example 26
     How many ways can five different door prizes be distributed among five people?

     There are 5 choices of prize for the first person, 4 choices for the second, and so on. The
     number of ways the prizes can be distributed will be 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 120 ways.

     Now we will consider some slightly different examples.

Example 27
     A charity benefit is attended by 25 people and three gift certificates are given away as door
     prizes: one gift certificate is in the amount of $100, the second is worth $25 and the third is
     worth $10. Assuming that no person receives more than one prize, how many different ways
     can the three gift certificates be awarded?
                                                                                              Probability 297

     Using the Basic Counting Rule, there are 25 choices for the person who receives the $100
     certificate, 24 remaining choices for the $25 certificate and 23 choices for the $10 certificate,
     so there are 25 · 24 · 23 = 13,800 ways in which the prizes can be awarded.

Example 28
     Eight sprinters have made it to the Olympic finals in the 100-meter race. In how many
     different ways can the gold, silver and bronze medals be awarded?

     Using the Basic Counting Rule, there are 8 choices for the gold medal winner, 7 remaining
     choices for the silver, and 6 for the bronze, so there are 8 · 7 · 6 = 336 ways the three medals
     can be awarded to the 8 runners.

     Note that in these preceding examples, the gift certificates and the Olympic medals were
     awarded without replacement; that is, once we have chosen a winner of the first door prize or
     the gold medal, they are not eligible for the other prizes. Thus, at each succeeding stage of
     the solution there is one fewer choice (25, then 24, then 23 in the first example; 8, then 7,
     then 6 in the second). Contrast this with the situation of a multiple choice test, where there
     might be five possible answers -- A, B, C, D or E -- for each question on the test.

     Note also that the order of selection was important in each example: for the three door prizes,
     being chosen first means that you receive substantially more money; in the Olympics
     example, coming in first means that you get the gold medal instead of the silver or bronze. In
     each case, if we had chosen the same three people in a different order there might have been
     a different person who received the $100 prize, or a different goldmedalist. (Contrast this
     with the situation where we might draw three names out of a hat to each receive a $10 gift
     certificate; in this case the order of selection is not important since each of the three people
     receive the same prize. Situations where the order is not important will be discussed in the
     next section.)

     We can generalize the situation in the two examples above to any problem without
     replacement where the order of selection is important. If we are arranging in order r items
     out of n possibilities (instead of 3 out of 25 or 3 out of 8 as in the previous examples), the
     number of possible arrangements will be given by

     n · (n - 1) · (n - 2) ··· (n - r + 1)

     If you don't see why (n -- r + 1) is the right number to use for the last factor, just think back
     to the first example in this section, where we calculated 25 · 24 · 23 to get 13,800. In this
     case n = 25 and r = 3, so n -- r + 1 = 25 -- 3 + 1 = 23, which is exactly the right number for
     the final factor.

     Now, why would we want to use this complicated formula when it's actually easier to use the
     Basic Counting Rule, as we did in the first two examples? Well, we won't actually use this
     formula all that often, we only developed it so that we could attach a special notation and a
     special definition to this situation where we are choosing r items out of n possibilities without
     replacement and where the order of selection is important. In this situation we write:
     298

         Permutations
         nPr = n · (n - 1) · (n - 2) ··· (n - r + 1)

         We say that there are nPr permutations of size r that may be selected from among n
         choices without replacement when order matters.

         It turns out that we can express this result more simply using factorials.

         n Pr = n!
                 (n - r)!

     In practicality, we usually use technology rather than factorials or repeated multiplication to
     compute permutations.

Example 29
     I have nine paintings and have room to display only four of them at a time on my wall. How
     many different ways could I do this?

     Since we are choosing 4 paintings out of 9 without replacement where the order of selection
     is important there are 9P4 = 9 · 8 · 7 · 6 = 3,024 permutations.

Example 30
     How many ways can a four-person executive committee (president, vice-president, secretary,
     treasurer) be selected from a 16-member board of directors of a non-profit organization?

     We want to choose 4 people out of 16 without replacement and where the order of selection
     is important. So the answer is 16P4 = 16 · 15 · 14 · 13 = 43,680.

     In the previous section we considered the situation where we chose r items out of n
     possibilities without replacement and where the order of selection was important. We now
     consider a similar situation in which the order of selection is not important.

Example 31
     A charity benefit is attended by 25 people at which three $50 gift certificates are given away
     as door prizes. Assuming no person receives more than one prize, how many different ways
     can the gift certificates be awarded?

     Using the Basic Counting Rule, there are 25 choices for the first person, 24 remaining
     choices for the second person and 23 for the third, so there are 25 · 24 · 23 = 13,800 ways to
     choose three people. Suppose for a moment that Abe is chosen first, Bea second and Cindy
     third; this is one of the 13,800 possible outcomes. Another way to award the prizes would be
     to choose Abe first, Cindy second and Bea third; this is another of the 13,800 possible
     outcomes. But either way Abe, Bea and Cindy each get $50, so it doesn't really matter the
     order in which we select them. In how many different orders can Abe, Bea and Cindy be
     selected? It turns out there are 6:

     ABC ACB BAC BCA CAB CBA

     How can we be sure that we have counted them all? We are really just choosing 3 people out
     of 3, so there are 3 · 2 · 1 = 6 ways to do this; we didn't really need to list them all, we can
     just use permutations!

     So, out of the 13,800 ways to select 3 people out of 25, six of them involve Abe, Bea and
     Cindy. The same argument works for any other group of three people (say Abe, Bea and
     David or Frank, Gloria and Hildy) so each three-person group is counted six times. Thus the
     13,800 figure is six times too big. The number of distinct three-person groups will be
     13,800/6 = 2300.

     We can generalize the situation in this example above to any problem of choosing a
     collection of items without replacement where the order of selection is not important. If we
     are choosing r items out of n possibilities (instead of 3 out of 25 as in the previous
     examples), the number of possible choices will be given by n Pr , and we could use this

                                                                               r Pr
     formula for computation. However this situation arises so frequently that we attach a special
     notation and a special definition to this situation where we are choosing r items out of n
     possibilities without replacement where the order of selection is not important.

         We say that there are nCr combinations of size r that may be selected from among n
         choices without replacement where order doesn't matter.

         We can also write the combinations formula in terms of factorials:
         n Cr = n!

     The United States Senate Appropriations Committee consists of 29 members; the Defense
     Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee consists of 19 members. Disregarding party
     affiliation or any special seats on the Subcommittee, how many different 19-member
     subcommittees may be chosen from among the 29 Senators on the Appropriations
     Committee?

     In the preceding Try it Now problem we assumed that the 19 members of the Defense
     Subcommittee were chosen without regard to party affiliation. In reality this would never
     happen: if Republicans are in the majority they would never let a majority of Democrats sit
     on (and thus control) any subcommittee. (The same of course would be true if the Democrats
     were in control.) So let's consider the problem again, in a slightly more complicated form:

Example 33
     The United States Senate Appropriations Committee consists of 29 members, 15 Republicans
     and 14 Democrats. The Defense Subcommittee consists of 19 members, 10 Republicans and
     9 Democrats. How many different ways can the members of the Defense Subcommittee be
     chosen from among the 29 Senators on the Appropriations Committee?

     In this case we need to choose 10 of the 15 Republicans and 9 of the 14 Democrats. There
     are 15C10 = 3003 ways to choose the 10 Republicans and 14C9 = 2002 ways to choose the 9
     Democrats. But now what? How do we finish the problem?

     Suppose we listed all of the possible 10-member Republican groups on 3003 slips of red
     paper and all of the possible 9-member Democratic groups on 2002 slips of blue paper.
     How many ways can we choose one red slip and one blue slip? This is a job for the Basic
     Counting Rule! We are simply making one choice from the first category and one choice
     from the second category, just like in the restaurant menu problems from earlier.

     There must be 3003 · 2002 = 6,012,006 possible ways of selecting the members of the
     Defense Subcommittee.

     Probability using Permutations and Combinations
     We can use permutations and combinations to help us answer more complex probability
     questions

Example 34
     A 4 digit PIN number is selected. What is the probability that there are no repeated digits?

     There are 10 possible values for each digit of the PIN (namely: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), so
     there are 10 · 10 · 10 · 10 = 104 = 10000 total possible PIN numbers.

     To have no repeated digits, all four digits would have to be different, which is selecting
     without replacement. We could either compute 10 · 9 · 8 · 7, or notice that this is the same
     as the permutation 10P4 = 5040.

     The probability of no repeated digits is the number of 4 digit PIN numbers with no repeated
     digits divided by the total number of 4 digit PIN numbers. This probability is
      4 10 P4 = 5040 = 0.504
      10 10000

Example 35
     In a certain state's lottery, 48 balls numbered 1 through 48 are placed in a machine and six of
     them are drawn at random. If the six numbers drawn match the numbers that a player had
     chosen, the player wins $1,000,000. In this lottery, the order the numbers are drawn in
     doesn't matter. Compute the probability that you win the million-dollar prize if you purchase
     a single lottery ticket.

     In order to compute the probability, we need to count the total number of ways six numbers
     can be drawn, and the number of ways the six numbers on the player's ticket could match the
     six numbers drawn from the machine. Since there is no stipulation that the numbers be in any
     particular order, the number of possible outcomes of the lottery drawing is 48C6 =
     12,271,512. Of these possible outcomes, only one would match all six numbers on the
     player's ticket, so the probability of winning the grand prize is:
      6 C6 = 1  0.0000000815
      48 C6 12271512

Example 36
     In the state lottery from the previous example, if five of the six numbers drawn match the
     numbers that a player has chosen, the player wins a second prize of $1,000. Compute the
     probability that you win the second prize if you purchase a single lottery ticket.

     As above, the number of possible outcomes of the lottery drawing is 48C6 = 12,271,512. In
     order to win the second prize, five of the six numbers on the ticket must match five of the six
     winning numbers; in other words, we must have chosen five of the six winning numbers and
302

one of the 42 losing numbers. The number of ways to choose 5 out of the 6 winning numbers
is given by 6C5 = 6 and the number of ways to choose 1 out of the 42 losing numbers is given
by 42C1 = 42. Thus the number of favorable outcomes is then given by the Basic Counting
Rule: 6C5 · 42C1 = 6 · 42 = 252. So the probability of winning the second prize is.

A multiple-choice question on an economics quiz contains 10 questions with five possible
answers each. Compute the probability of randomly guessing the answers and getting 9
questions correct.

Example 37
     Compute the probability of randomly drawing five cards from a deck and getting exactly one
     Ace.

In many card games (such as poker) the order in which the cards are drawn is not important
(since the player may rearrange the cards in his hand any way he chooses); in the problems
that follow, we will assume that this is the case unless otherwise stated. Thus we use
combinations to compute the possible number of 5-card hands, 52C5. This number will go in
the denominator of our probability formula, since it is the number of possible outcomes.

For the numerator, we need the number of ways to draw one Ace and four other cards (none
of them Aces) from the deck. Since there are four Aces and we want exactly one of them,
there will be 4C1 ways to select one Ace; since there are 48 non-Aces and we want 4 of them,
there will be 48C4 ways to select the four non-Aces. Now we use the Basic Counting Rule to
calculate that there will be 4C1 · 48C4 ways to choose one ace and four non-Aces.

Putting this all together, we have

P(one Ace) = (4 C1 )(48 C4 ) = 778320  0.299
            52 C5     2598960

Example 38
     Compute the probability of randomly drawing five cards from a deck and getting exactly two
     Aces.

The solution is similar to the previous example, except now we are choosing 2 Aces out of 4
and 3 non-Aces out of 48; the denominator remains the same:

P(two Aces) = ( 4 C2 )( 48 C3 ) = 103776  0.0399

     Birthday Problem
     Let's take a pause to consider a famous problem in probability theory:

              Suppose you have a room full of 30 people. What is the probability that there is at
              least one shared birthday?

     Take a guess at the answer to the above problem. Was your guess fairly low, like around
     10%? That seems to be the intuitive answer (30/365, perhaps?). Let's see if we should listen
     to our intuition. Let's start with a simpler problem, however.

Example 39
     Suppose three people are in a room. What is the probability that there is at least one shared
     birthday among these three people?

     There are a lot of ways there could be at least one shared birthday. Fortunately there is an
     easier way. We ask ourselves "What is the alternative to having at least one shared
     birthday?" In this case, the alternative is that there are no shared birthdays. In other words,
     the alternative to "at least one" is having none. In other words, since this is a complementary
     event,

     P(at least one) = 1 - P(none)

     We will start, then, by computing the probability that there is no shared birthday. Let's
     imagine that you are one of these three people. Your birthday can be anything without
     conflict, so there are 365 choices out of 365 for your birthday. What is the probability that
     the second person does not share your birthday? There are 365 days in the year (let's ignore
     leap years) and removing your birthday from contention, there are 364 choices that will
     guarantee that you do not share a birthday with this person, so the probability that the second
     person does not share your birthday is 364/365. Now we move to the third person. What is
     the probability that this third person does not have the same birthday as either you or the
     second person? There are 363 days that will not duplicate your birthday or the second
     person's, so the probability that the third person does not share a birthday with the first two is
     363/365.

     We want the second person not to share a birthday with you and the third person not to share
     a birthday with the first two people, so we use the multiplication rule:
     304

      P(no shared birthday) = 365  364  363  0.9918
                                   365 365 365

     and then subtract from 1 to get

     P(shared birthday) = 1 - P(no shared birthday) = 1 - 0.9918 = 0.0082.

     This is a pretty small number, so maybe it makes sense that the answer to our original
     problem will be small. Let's make our group a bit bigger.

Example 40
     Suppose five people are in a room. What is the probability that there is at least one shared
     birthday among these five people?

     Continuing the pattern of the previous example, the answer should be
      P(shared birthday) = 1- 365  364  363  362  361  0.0271

                                   365 365 365 365 365

     Note that we could rewrite this more compactly as
      P(shared birthday) = 1- 5 365 P5  0.0271

                                   365
     which makes it a bit easier to type into a calculator or computer, and which suggests a nice
     formula as we continue to expand the population of our group.

Example 41
     Suppose 30 people are in a room. What is the probability that there is at least one shared
     birthday among these 30 people?

     Here we can calculate
      P(shared birthday) = 1- 30 365 P30  0.706

                                   365

     which gives us the surprising result that when you are in a room with 30 people there is a
     70% chance that there will be at least one shared birthday!

     If you like to bet, and if you can convince 30 people to reveal their birthdays, you might be
     able to win some money by betting a friend that there will be at least two people with the
     same birthday in the room anytime you are in a room of 30 or more people. (Of course, you
     would need to make sure your friend hasn't studied probability!) You wouldn't be guaranteed
     to win, but you should win more than half the time.

     This is one of many results in probability theory that is counterintuitive; that is, it goes
     against our gut instincts. If you still don't believe the math, you can carry out a simulation.
                                                                                        Probability 305

Just so you won't have to go around rounding up groups of 30 people, someone has kindly
developed a Java applet so that you can conduct a computer simulation. Go to this web page:
http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/surprise/Birthday.html, and once the applet has loaded,
select 30 birthdays and then keep clicking Start and Reset. If you keep track of the number
of times that there is a repeated birthday, you should get a repeated birthday about 7 out of
every 10 times you run the simulation.

Expected Value
   Expected value is perhaps the most useful probability concept we will discuss. It has many
   applications, from insurance policies to making financial decisions, and it's one thing that the
   casinos and government agencies that run gambling operations and lotteries hope most
   people never learn about.

Example 42
     1In the casino game roulette, a wheel with 38 spaces (18 red, 18
     black, and 2 green) is spun. In one possible bet, the player bets
     $1 on a single number. If that number is spun on the wheel, then
     they receive $36 (their original $1 + $35). Otherwise, they lose
     their $1. On average, how much money should a player expect to
     win or lose if they play this game repeatedly?

     Suppose you bet $1 on each of the 38 spaces on the wheel, for a
     total of $38 bet. When the winning number is spun, you are paid $36 on that number. While
     you won on that one number, overall you've lost $2. On a per-space basis, you have "won" -
     $2/$38  -$0.053. In other words, on average you lose 5.3 cents per space you bet on.

We call this average gain or loss the expected value of playing roulette. Notice that no one
ever loses exactly 5.3 cents: most people (in fact, about 37 out of every 38) lose $1 and a
very few people (about 1 person out of every 38) gain $35 (the $36 they win minus the $1
they spent to play the game).

There is another way to compute expected value without imagining what would happen if we

play every possible space. There are 38 possible outcomes when the wheel spins, so the

probability of winning is 1 . The complement, the probability of losing, is 37 .

0.9211 + (-0.9737)  -0.053, which is the expected value we computed above.

Expected Value
Expected Value is the average gain or loss of an event if the procedure is repeated
many times.

We can compute the expected value by multiplying each outcome by the probability of
that outcome, then adding up the products.

              12271512 12271512

The expected value, then is:

($999,999) 1 + ($999) 252 + (- $1) 12271259  -$0.898
12271512                      12271512  12271512

On average, one can expect to lose about 90 cents on a lottery ticket. Of course, most players
will lose $1.

In general, if the expected value of a game is negative, it is not a good idea to play the game,
since on average you will lose money. It would be better to play a game with a positive
expected value (good luck trying to find one!), although keep in mind that even if the
average winnings are positive it could be the case that most people lose money and one very
fortunate individual wins a great deal of money. If the expected value of a game is 0, we call
it a fair game, since neither side has an advantage.

Not surprisingly, the expected value for casino games is negative for the player, which is
positive for the casino. It must be positive or they would go out of business. Players just
need to keep in mind that when they play a game repeatedly, their expected value is negative.
That is fine so long as you enjoy playing the game and think it is worth the cost. But it
would be wrong to expect to come out ahead.

Example 44
     A 40-year-old man in the U.S. has a 0.242% risk of dying during the next year2. An

     benefit. What is the expected value for the person buying the insurance?

The probabilities and outcomes are

     Outcome                        Probability of outcome

     -$275                          1 - 0.00242 = 0.99758

The expected value is ($99,725)(0.00242) + (-$275)(0.99758) = -$33.

Not surprisingly, the expected value is negative; the insurance company can only afford to
offer policies if they, on average, make money on each policy. They can afford to pay out
the occasional benefit because they offer enough policies that those benefit payouts are
balanced by the rest of the insured people.

For people buying the insurance, there is a negative expected value, but there is a security
that comes from insurance that is worth that cost.

    other doors to show there was no prize there. The contestant was then asked if they
    wanted to stay with their original door, or switch to the other unopened door. Is it better
    to stay or switch, or does it matter?

87. Suppose you have two coins, where one is a fair coin, and the other coin comes up heads
    70% of the time. What is the probability you have the fair coin given each of the
    following outcomes from a series of flips?
         a. 5 Heads and 0 Tails
         b. 8 Heads and 3 Tails
         c. 10 Heads and 10 Tails

88. Suppose you have six coins, where five are fair coins, and one coin comes up heads 80%

         b. 8 Heads and 3 Tails
         c. 10 Heads and 10 Tails
         d. 3 Heads and 8 Tails

89. In this problem, we will explore probabilities from a series of events.
         a. If you flip 20 coins, how many would you expect to come up "heads", on
             average? Would you expect every flip of 20 coins to come up with exactly that
             many heads?
         b. If you were to flip 20 coins, what would you consider a "usual" result? An
             "unusual" result?
         c. Flip 20 coins (or one coin 20 times) and record how many come up "heads".
             Repeat this experiment 9 more times. Collect the data from the entire class.
         d. When flipping 20 coins, what is the theoretic probability of flipping 20 heads?
         e. Based on the class's experimental data, what appears to be the probability of
             flipping 10 heads out of 20 coins?

      f. The formula n Cx p x (1 - p)n-x will compute the probability of an event with

             probability p occurring x times out of n, such as flipping x heads out of n coins
             where the probability of heads is p = ½. Use this to compute the theoretic
             probability of flipping 10 heads out of 20 coins.
         g. If you were to flip 20 coins, based on the class's experimental data, what range of
             values would you consider a "usual" result? What is the combined probability of
             these results? What would you consider an "unusual" result? What is the
             combined probability of these results?
         h. We'll now consider a simplification of a case from the 1960s. In the area, about
             26% of the jury eligible population was black. In the court case, there were 100
             men on the juror panel, of which 8 were black. Does this provide evidence of
             racial bias in jury selection?

Sets

     It is natural for us to classify items into groups, or sets, and consider how those sets overlap
     with each other. We can use these sets understand relationships between groups, and to
     analyze survey data.
 Basics

     An art collector might own a collection of paintings, while a music lover might keep a
     collection of CDs. Any collection of items can form a set.

         Set
         A set is a collection of distinct objects, called elements of the set

         A set can be defined by describing the contents, or by listing the elements of the set,
         enclosed in curly brackets.

Example 1
     Some examples of sets defined by describing the contents:
     a) The set of all even numbers
     b) The set of all books written about travel to Chile

     Some examples of sets defined by listing the elements of the set:
     a) {1, 3, 9, 12}
     b) {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple}

     A set simply specifies the contents; order is not important. The set represented by {1, 2, 3} is
     equivalent to the set {3, 1, 2}.

         Notation
         Commonly, we will use a variable to represent a set, to make it easier to refer to that set
         later.

         The symbol  means "is an element of".

         A set that contains no elements, { }, is called the empty set and is notated 

Example 2
     Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}

     To notate that 2 is element of the set, we'd write 2  A

Sometimes a collection might not contain all the elements of a set. For example, Chris owns
three Madonna albums. While Chris's collection is a set, we can also say it is a subset of the
larger set of all Madonna albums.

Subset
A subset of a set A is another set that contains only elements from the set A, but may
not contain all the elements of A.

If B is a subset of A, we write B  A

A proper subset is a subset that is not identical to the original set - it contains fewer
elements.

If B is a proper subset of A, we write B  A

Example 3                             B = {2, 4, 6} C = {2, 3, 4, 6}
     Consider these three sets
     A = the set of all even numbers

Here B  A since every element of B is also an even number, so is an element of A.

More formally, we could say B  A since if x  B, then x  A.

It is also true that B  C.

C is not a subset of A, since C contains an element, 3, that is not contained in A

Example 4
     Suppose a set contains the plays "Much Ado About Nothing", "MacBeth", and "A
     Midsummer's Night Dream". What is a larger set this might be a subset of?

     There are many possible answers here. One would be the set of plays by Shakespeare. This
     is also a subset of the set of all plays ever written. It is also a subset of all British literature.

Union, Intersection, and Complement
   Commonly sets interact. For example, you and a new roommate decide to have a house
   party, and you both invite your circle of friends. At this party, two sets are being combined,
   though it might turn out that there are some friends that were in both sets.

Union, Intersection, and Complement
The union of two sets contains all the elements contained in either set (or both sets).
The union is notated A  B.
More formally, x  A  B if x  A or x  B (or both)

The intersection of two sets contains only the elements that are in both sets.
The intersection is notated A  B.
More formally, x  A  B if x  A and x  B

The complement of a set A contains everything that is not in the set A.
The complement is notated A', or Ac, or sometimes ~A.

Example 5                                            B = {red, yellow, orange}
     Consider the sets: A = {red, green, blue}
     C = {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple}

a) Find A  B

The union contains all the elements in either set: A  B = {red, green, blue, yellow, orange}
Notice we only list red once.

b) Find A  B

The intersection contains all the elements in both sets: A  B = {red}
c) Find Ac  C

Here we're looking for all the elements that are not in set A and are also in C.
Ac  C = {orange, yellow, purple}

Try it Now 2
Using the sets from the previous example, find A  C and Bc  A

Notice that in the example above, it would be hard to just ask for Ac, since everything from
the color fuchsia to puppies and peanut butter are included in the complement of the set. For
this reason, complements are usually only used with intersections, or when we have a
universal set in place.
     322

         Universal Set
         A universal set is a set that contains all the elements we are interested in. This would
         have to be defined by the context.

         A complement is relative to the universal set, so Ac contains all the elements in the
         universal set that are not in A.

Example 6
       a) If we were discussing searching for books, the universal set might be all the books in
           the library.
       b) If we were grouping your Facebook friends, the universal set would be all your
           Facebook friends.
       c) If you were working with sets of numbers, the universal set might be all whole
           numbers, all integers, or all real numbers

Example 7
     Suppose the universal set is U = all whole numbers from 1 to 9. If A = {1, 2, 4}, then

     Ac = {3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

     As we saw earlier with the expression Ac  C, set operations can be grouped together.
     Grouping symbols can be used like they are with arithmetic - to force an order of operations.

Example 8
     Suppose H = {cat, dog, rabbit, mouse}, F = {dog, cow, duck, pig, rabbit}
     W = {duck, rabbit, deer, frog, mouse}

     a) Find (H  F)  W

     We start with the intersection: H  F = {dog, rabbit}
     Now we union that result with W: (H  F)  W = {dog, duck, rabbit, deer, frog, mouse}

     b) Find H  (F  W)

     We start with the union: F  W = {dog, cow, rabbit, duck, pig, deer, frog, mouse}
     Now we intersect that result with H: H  (F  W) = {dog, rabbit, mouse}

     c) Find (H  F)c  W

     We start with the intersection: H  F = {dog, rabbit}
     Now we want to find the elements of W that are not in H  F
     (H  F)c  W = {duck, deer, frog, mouse}
                                                                                                    Sets 323

Venn Diagrams

   To visualize the interaction of sets, John Venn in 1880 thought to use overlapping circles,
   building on a similar idea used by Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. These illustrations
   now called Venn Diagrams.

    Venn Diagram
    A Venn diagram represents each set by a circle, usually drawn inside of a containing
    box representing the universal set. Overlapping areas indicate elements common to
    both sets.

Basic Venn diagrams can illustrate the interaction of two or three sets.

Example 9
     Create Venn diagrams to illustrate A  B, A  B, and Ac  B

A  B contains all elements in either set.               A

                                                                          B

A  B contains only those elements in both sets -               A  B
in the overlap of the circles.

    A        B

       A  B

Ac will contain all elements not in the set A. Ac  B A                    B

will contain the elements in set B that are not in set

A.

                                                               Ac  B
324

Example 10
     Use a Venn diagram to illustrate (H  F)c  W

We'll start by identifying everything in the set H  F

H         F

           W

Now, (H  F)c  W will contain everything not in the set identified above that is also in set
W.

The elements in the outlined set are in sets H and F,

but are not in set W. So we could represent this set as

H  F  Wc

 Cardinality
     Often times we are interested in the number of items in a set or subset. This is called the
     cardinality of the set.

         Cardinality
         The number of elements in a set is the cardinality of that set.
         The cardinality of the set A is often notated as |A| or n(A)

Example 12
     Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8}.
     What is the cardinality of B? A  B, A  B?
     The cardinality of B is 4, since there are 4 elements in the set.
     The cardinality of A  B is 7, since A  B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}, which contains 7 elements.
     The cardinality of A  B is 3, since A  B = {2, 4, 6}, which contains 3 elements.

Example 13
     What is the cardinality of P = the set of English names for the months of the year?
     The cardinality of this set is 12, since there are 12 months in the year.

     Sometimes we may be interested in the cardinality of the union or intersection of sets, but not
     know the actual elements of each set. This is common in surveying.
326

Example 14
     A survey asks 200 people "What beverage do you drink in the morning", and offers choices:
     · Tea only
     · Coffee only
     · Both coffee and tea

Suppose 20 report tea only, 80 report coffee only, 40 report both. How many people drink
tea in the morning? How many people drink neither tea or coffee?

This question can most easily be answered by               80 40 20
creating a Venn diagram. We can see that we can
find the people who drink tea by adding those who          Coffee  Tea
drink only tea to those who drink both: 60 people.

We can also see that those who drink neither are
those not contained in the any of the three other
groupings, so we can count those by subtracting
from the cardinality of the universal set, 200.
200 - 20 - 80 - 40 = 60 people who drink neither.

Example 15
     A survey asks: Which online services have you used in the last month:
     · Twitter
     · Facebook
     · Have used both

     The results show 40% of those surveyed have used Twitter, 70% have used Facebook, and
     20% have used both. How many people have used neither Twitter or Facebook?

     Let T be the set of all people who have used Twitter, and F be the set of all people who have
     used Facebook. Notice that while the cardinality of F is 70% and the cardinality of T is 40%,
     the cardinality of F  T is not simply 70% + 40%, since that would count those who use both
     services twice. To find the cardinality of F  T, we can add the cardinality of F and the
     cardinality of T, then subtract those in intersection that we've counted twice. In symbols,
     n(F  T) = n(F) + n(T) - n(F  T)
     n(F  T) = 70% + 40% - 20% = 90%

     Now, to find how many people have not used either service, we're looking for the cardinality
     of (F  T)c . Since the universal set contains 100% of people and the cardinality of F  T =
     90%, the cardinality of (F  T)c must be the other 10%.

The previous example illustrated two important properties
                                                                         Sets 327

Cardinality properties
n(A  B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A  B)

n(Ac) = n(U) - n(A)

Notice that the first property can also be written in an equivalent form by solving for the
cardinality of the intersection:
n(A  B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A  B)

Example 16

Fifty students were surveyed, and asked if they were taking a social science (SS), humanities

(HM) or a natural science (NS) course the next quarter.

21 were taking a SS course               26 were taking a HM course

19 were taking a NS course               9 were taking SS and HM

7 were taking SS and NS                  10 were taking HM and NS

3 were taking all three                  7 were taking none

How many students are only taking a SS course?

It might help to look at a Venn diagram.                 SS                    HM
From the given data, we know that there are                              c
3 students in region e and                                   a     b
7 students in region h.
                                                                d  e  f
Since 7 students were taking a SS and NS course, we
know that n(d) + n(e) = 7. Since we know there are 3                    g
students in region 3, there must be                                                   h
7 - 3 = 4 students in region d.
                                                             NS
Similarly, since there are 10 students taking HM and
NS, which includes regions e and f, there must be
10 - 3 = 7 students in region f.

Since 9 students were taking SS and HM, there must be 9 - 3 = 6 students in region b.

Now, we know that 21 students were taking a SS course. This includes students from regions
a, b, d, and e. Since we know the number of students in all but region a, we can determine
that 21 - 6 - 4 - 3 = 8 students are in region a.

8 students are taking only a SS course.

Historical Counting Systems

 Introduction and Basic Number and Counting Systems

Introduction

As we begin our journey through the history of mathematics, one question to be asked is
"Where do we start?" Depending on how you view mathematics or numbers, you could
choose any of a number of launching points from which to begin. Howard Eves suggests the
following list of possibilities.1

Where  to start the study of the history of mathematics...
    -  At the first logical geometric "proofs" traditionally credited to Thales of Miletus (600
       BCE).
    -  With the formulation of methods of measurement made by the Egyptians and
       Mesopotamians/Babylonians.
    -  Where prehistoric peoples made efforts to organize the concepts of size, shape, and
       number.
    -  In pre-human times in the very simple number sense and pattern recognition that can
       be displayed by certain animals, birds, etc.
    -  Even before that in the amazing relationships of numbers and shapes found in plants.
    -  With the spiral nebulae, the natural course of planets, and other universe phenomena.

We can choose no starting point at all and instead agree that mathematics has always existed
and has simply been waiting in the wings for humans to discover. Each of these positions
can be defended to some degree and which one you adopt (if any) largely depends on your
philosophical ideas about mathematics and numbers.

Nevertheless, we need a starting point. Without passing judgment on the validity of any of
these particular possibilities, we will choose as our starting point the emergence of the idea of
number and the process of counting as our launching pad. This is done primarily as a
practical matter given the nature of this course. In the following chapter, we will try to focus
on two main ideas. The first will be an examination of basic number and counting systems
and the symbols that we use for numbers. We will look at our own modern (Western)
number system as well those of a couple of selected civilizations to see the differences and
diversity that is possible when humans start counting. The second idea we will look at will
be base systems. By comparing our own base-ten (decimal) system with other bases, we will
quickly become aware that the system that we are so used to, when slightly changed, will
challenge our notions about numbers and what symbols for those numbers actually mean.

Recognition of More vs. Less

The idea of numbers and the process of counting goes back far beyond when history began to
be recorded. There is some archeological evidence that suggests that humans were counting
as far back as 50,000 years ago.2 However, we do not really know how this process started
or developed over time. The best we can do is to make a good guess as to how things
progressed. It is probably not hard to believe that even the earliest humans had some sense

of more and less. Even some small animals have been shown to have such a sense. For
example, one naturalist tells of how he would secretly remove one egg each day from a
plover's nest. The mother was diligent in laying an extra egg every day to make up for the
missing egg. Some research has shown that hens can be trained to distinguish between even
and odd numbers of pieces of food.3 With these sorts of findings in mind, it is not hard to
conceive that early humans had (at least) a similar sense of more and less. However, our
conjectures about how and when these ideas emerged among humans are simply that;
educated guesses based on our own assumptions of what might or could have been.

The Need for Simple Counting
As societies and humankind evolved, simply having a sense of more or less, even or odd,
etc., would prove to be insufficient to meet the needs of everyday living. As tribes and
groups formed, it became important to be able to know how many members were in the
group, and perhaps how many were in the enemy's camp. Certainly it was important for
them to know if the flock of sheep or other possessed animals were increasing or decreasing
in size. "Just how many of them do we have, anyway?" is a question that we do not have a
hard time imagining them asking themselves (or each other).

In order to count items such as animals, it is often conjectured that one of the earliest
methods of doing so would be with "tally sticks." These are objects used to track the
numbers of items to be counted. With this method, each "stick" (or pebble, or whatever
counting device being used) represents one animal or object. This method uses the idea of
one to one correspondence. In a one to one correspondence, items that are being counted are
uniquely linked with some counting tool.

In the picture to the right, you see each stick corresponding to one
horse. By examining the collection of sticks in hand one knows how
many animals should be present. You can imagine the usefulness of
such a system, at least for smaller numbers of items to keep track of.
If a herder wanted to "count off" his animals to make sure they were
all present, he could mentally (or methodically) assign each stick to
one animal and continue to do so until he was satisfied that all were
accounted for.

Of course, in our modern system, we have replaced the sticks with more abstract objects. In
particular, the top stick is replaced with our symbol "1," the second stick gets replaced by a
"2" and the third stick is represented by the symbol "3," but we are getting ahead of
ourselves here. These modern symbols took many centuries to emerge.

Another possible way of employing the "tally stick" counting method is by making marks or
cutting notches into pieces of wood, or even tying knots in string (as we shall see later). In
1937, Karl Absolom discovered a wolf bone that goes back possibly 30,000 years. It is
believed to be a counting device.4 Another example of this kind of tool is the Ishango Bone,
discovered in 1960 at Ishango, and shown below.5 It is reported to be between six and nine
thousand years old and shows what appear to be markings used to do counting of some sort.
                                      Historical Counting Systems 335

The markings on rows (a) and (b)
each add up to 60. Row (b)
contains the prime numbers
between 10 and 20. Row (c) seems
to illustrate for the method of
doubling and multiplication used
by the Egyptians. It is believed
that this may also represent a lunar
phase counter.

Spoken Words
As methods for counting developed, and as language progressed as well, it is natural to
expect that spoken words for numbers would appear. Unfortunately, the developments of
these words, especially those corresponding to the numbers from one through ten, are not
easy to trace. Past ten, however, we do see some patterns:

Eleven comes from "ein lifon," meaning "one left over."
Twelve comes from "twe lif," meaning "two left over."
Thirteen comes from "Three and ten" as do fourteen through nineteen.
Twenty appears to come from "twe-tig" which means "two tens."
Hundred probably comes from a term meaning "ten times."

Written Numbers
When we speak of "written" numbers, we have to be careful because this could mean a
variety of things. It is important to keep in mind that modern paper is only a little more than
100 years old, so "writing" in times past often took on forms that might look quite unfamiliar
to us today.

As we saw earlier, some might consider wooden sticks with notches carved in them as
writing as these are means of recording information on a medium that can be "read" by
others. Of course, the symbols used (simple notches) certainly did not leave a lot of
flexibility for communicating a wide variety of ideas or information.

Other mediums on which "writing" may have taken place include carvings in stone or clay
tablets, rag paper made by hand (12th century in Europe, but earlier in China), papyrus
(invented by the Egyptians and used up until the Greeks), and parchments from animal skins.
And these are just a few of the many possibilities.

These are just a few examples of early methods of counting and simple symbols for
representing numbers. Extensive books, articles and research have been done on this topic
and could provide enough information to fill this entire course if we allowed it to. The range
and diversity of creative thought that has been used in the past to describe numbers and to
count objects and people is staggering. Unfortunately, we don't have time to examine them
all, but it is fun and interesting to look at one system in more detail to see just how ingenious
people have been.
   336

The Number and Counting System of the Inca Civilization

   Background
   There is generally a lack of books and research material concerning the historical foundations
   of the Americas. Most of the "important" information available concentrates on the eastern
   hemisphere, with Europe as the central focus. The reasons for this may be twofold: first, it is
   thought that there was a lack of specialized mathematics in the American regions; second,
   many of the secrets of ancient mathematics in the Americas have been closely guarded.6 The
   Peruvian system does not seem to be an exception here. Two researchers, Leland Locke and
   Erland Nordenskiold, have carried out research that has attempted to discover what
   mathematical knowledge was known by the Incas and how they used the Peruvian quipu, a
   counting system using cords and knots, in their mathematics. These researchers have come
   to certain beliefs about the quipu that we will summarize here.

   Counting Boards
   It should be noted that the Incas did not have a complicated system of computation. Where
   other peoples in the regions, such as the Mayans, were doing computations related to their
   rituals and calendars, the Incas seem to have been more concerned with the simpler task of
   record-keeping. To do this, they used what are called the "quipu" to record quantities of
   items. (We will describe them in more detail in a moment.) However, they first often needed
   to do computations whose results would be recorded on quipu. To do these computations,
   they would sometimes use a counting board constructed with a slab of stone. In the slab
   were cut rectangular and square compartments so that an octagonal (eight-sided) region was
   left in the middle. Two opposite corner
   rectangles were raised. Another two
   sections were mounted on the original
   surface of the slab so that there were
   actually three levels available. In the figure
   shown, the darkest shaded corner regions
   represent the highest, third level. The
   lighter shaded regions surrounding the
   corners are the second highest levels, while
   the clear white rectangles are the
   compartments cut into the stone slab.

   Pebbles were used to keep accounts and their positions within the various levels and
   compartments gave totals. For example, a pebble in a smaller (white) compartment
   represented one unit. Note that there are 12 such squares around the outer edge of the figure.
   If a pebble was put into one of the two (white) larger, rectangular compartments, its value
   was doubled. When a pebble was put in the octagonal region in the middle of the slab, its
   value was tripled. If a pebble was placed on the second (shaded) level, its value was
   multiplied by six. And finally, if a pebble was found on one of the two highest corner levels,
   its value was multiplied by twelve. Different objects could be counted at the same time by
   representing different objects by different colored pebbles.
                                                                        Historical Counting Systems 337

Example 1
     Suppose you have the following
     counting board with two different kind
     of pebbles places as illustrated. Let the
     solid black pebble represent a dog and
     the striped pebble represent a cat. How
     many dogs are being represented?

     There are two black pebbles in the outer
     square regions...these represent 2 dogs.

     There are three black pebbles in the
     larger (white) rectangular
     compartments. These represent 6 dogs.
     There is one black pebble in the middle region...this represents 3 dogs.
     There are three black pebbles on the second level...these represent 18 dogs.
     Finally, there is one black pebble on the highest corner level...this represents 12 dogs. We
     then have a total of 2+6+3+18+12 = 41 dogs.

     Try it Now 1
     How many cats are represented on this board?

     The Quipu
     This kind of board was good for doing quick computations, but
     it did not provide a good way to keep a permanent recording of
     quantities or computations. For this purpose, they used the
     quipu. The quipu is a collection of cords with knots in them.
     These cords and knots are carefully arranged so that the position
     and type of cord or knot gives specific information on how to
     decipher the cord.

     A quipu is made up of a main cord which has other cords
     (branches) tied to it. See pictures to the right.7

     Locke called the branches H cords. They are attached to the main
     cord. B cords, in turn, were attached to the H cords. Most of these
     cords would have knots on them. Rarely are knots found on the
     main cord, however, and tend to be mainly on the H and B cords.
     A quipu might also have a "totalizer" cord that summarizes all of
     the information on the cord group in one place.
338

Locke points out that there are three
types of knots, each representing a
different value, depending on the
kind of knot used and its position on
the cord. The Incas, like us, had a
decimal (base-ten) system, so each
kind of knot had a specific decimal
value. The Single knot, pictured in
the middle of the diagram8 was used to denote tens, hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands.
They would be on the upper levels of the H cords. The figure-eight knot on the end was
used to denote the integer "one." Every other integer from 2 to 9 was represented with a long
knot, shown on the left of the figure. (Sometimes long knots were used to represents tens
and hundreds.) Note that the long knot has several turns in it...the number of turns indicates
which integer is being represented. The units (ones) were placed closest to the bottom of the
cord, then tens right above them, then the hundreds, and so on.

In order to make reading these pictures easier, we will adopt a convention that is consistent.
For the long knot with turns in it (representing the numbers 2 through 9), we will use the
following notation:

The four horizontal bars represent four turns and the curved arc on the right links the four
turns together. This would represent the number 4.

We will represent the single knot with a large dot ( · ) and we will represent the figure eight
knot with a sideways eight (  ).

Example 2                                                    Main Cord
     What number is represented on the cord shown?

     On the cord, we see a long knot with four turns in
     it...this represents four in the ones place. Then 5
     single knots appear in the tens position immediately
     above that, which represents 5 tens, or 50. Finally, 4
     single knots are tied in the hundreds, representing
     four 4 hundreds, or 400. Thus, the total shown on this
     cord is 454.
                                                  Historical Counting Systems 339

Try it Now 2                                      Main Cord
What numbers are represented on each of the four
cords hanging from the main cord?

                                                                                    

The colors of the cords had meaning and could distinguish one object from another. One
color could represent llamas, while a different color might represent sheep, for example.
When all the colors available were exhausted, they would have to be re-used. Because of
this, the ability to read the quipu became a complicated task and specially trained individuals
did this job. They were called Quipucamayoc, which means keeper of the quipus. They
would build, guard, and decipher quipus.

As you can see from this photograph of
an actual quipu, they could get quite
complex.

There were various purposes for the
quipu. Some believe that they were used
to keep an account of their traditions and
history, using knots to record history
rather than some other formal system of
writing. One writer has even suggested
that the quipu replaced writing as it
formed a role in the Incan postal system.9
Another proposed use of the quipu is as a
translation tool. After the conquest of the
Incas by the Spaniards and subsequent
"conversion" to Catholicism, an Inca
supposedly could use the quipu to confess their sins to a priest. Yet another proposed use of
the quipu was to record numbers related to magic and astronomy, although this is not a
widely accepted interpretation.

The mysteries of the quipu have not been fully explored yet. Recently, Ascher and Ascher
have published a book, The Code of the Quipu: A Study in Media, Mathematics, and Culture,
which is "an extensive elaboration of the logical-numerical system of the quipu."10 For more
information on the quipu, you may want to check out the following Internet link:

         http://www.anthropology.wisc.edu/salomon/Chaysimire/khipus.php

We are so used to seeing the symbols 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. that it may be somewhat surprising to see
such a creative and innovative way to compute and record numbers. Unfortunately, as we
   340

   proceed through our mathematical education in grade and high school, we receive very little
   information about the wide range of number systems that have existed and which still exist
   all over the world. That's not to say our own system is not important or efficient. The fact
   that it has survived for hundreds of years and shows no sign of going away any time soon
   suggests that we may have finally found a system that works well and may not need further
   improvement, but only time will tell that whether or not that conjecture is valid or not. We
   now turn to a brief historical look at how our current system developed over history.

The Hindu - Arabic Number System

   The Evolution of a System
   Our own number system, composed of the ten symbols {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} is called the
   Hindu-Arabic system. This is a base-ten (decimal) system since place values increase by
   powers of ten. Furthermore, this system is positional, which means that the position of a
   symbol has bearing on the value of that symbol within the number. For example, the position
   of the symbol 3 in the number 435,681 gives it a value much greater than the value of the
   symbol 8 in that same number. We'll explore base systems more thoroughly later. The
   development of these ten symbols and their use in a positional system comes to us primarily
   from India.11

   It was not until the 15th century that the symbols that we are familiar with today first
   took form in Europe. However, the history of these numbers and their development
   goes back hundreds of years. One important source of information on this topic is
   the writer al-Biruni, whose picture is shown here.12 Al-Biruni, who was born in
   modern day Uzbekistan, had visited India on several occasions and made comments
   on the Indian number system. When we look at the origins of the numbers that
   al-Biruni encountered, we have to go back to the third century B.C.E. to explore
   their origins. It is then that the Brahmi numerals were being used.

   The Brahmi numerals were more complicated than those used in our own modern system.
   They had separate symbols for the numbers 1 through 9, as well as distinct symbols for 10,
   100, 1000,..., also for 20, 30, 40,..., and others for 200, 300, 400, ..., 900. The Brahmi
   symbols for 1, 2, and 3 are shown below.13

   These numerals were used all the way up to the 4th century C.E., with variations through time
   and geographic location. For example, in the first century C.E., one particular set of Brahmi
   numerals took on the following form14:
                                                                   Historical Counting Systems 341

From the 4th century on, you can actually trace several different paths that the Brahmi
numerals took to get to different points and incarnations. One of those paths led to our
current numeral system, and went through what are called the Gupta numerals. The Gupta
numerals were prominent during a time ruled by the Gupta dynasty and were spread
throughout that empire as they conquered lands during the 4th through 6th centuries. They
have the following form15:

How the numbers got to their Gupta form is open to considerable debate. Many possible
hypotheses have been offered, most of which boil down to two basic types16. The first type
of hypothesis states that the numerals came from the initial letters of the names of the
numbers. This is not uncommon...the Greek numerals developed in this manner. The
second type of hypothesis states that they were derived from some earlier number system.
However, there are other hypotheses that are offered, one of which is by the researcher Ifrah.
His theory is that there were originally nine numerals, each represented by a corresponding
number of vertical lines. One possibility is this:17

Because these symbols would have taken a lot of time to write, they eventually evolved into
cursive symbols that could be written more quickly. If we compare these to the Gupta
numerals above, we can try to see how that evolutionary process might have taken place, but
our imagination would be just about all we would have to depend upon since we do not know
exactly how the process unfolded.
The Gupta numerals eventually evolved into another form of numerals called the Nagari
numerals, and these continued to evolve until the 11th century, at which time they looked like
this:18
342

Note that by this time, the symbol for 0 has appeared! The Mayans in the Americas had a
symbol for zero long before this, however, as we shall see later in the chapter.
These numerals were adopted by the Arabs, most likely in the eighth century during Islamic
incursions into the northern part of India.19 It is believed that the Arabs were instrumental in
spreading them to other parts of the world, including Spain (see below).
Other examples of variations up to the eleventh century include:
Devangari, eighth century20:

West Arab Gobar, tenth century21:

Spain, 976 B.C.E.22:

Finally, one more graphic23 shows various forms of these numerals as they developed and
eventually converged to the 15th century in Europe.
                                                                   Historical Counting Systems 343

The Positional System
More important than the form of the number symbols is the development of the place value
system. Although it is in slight dispute, the earliest known document in which the Indian
system displays a positional system dates back to 346 C.E. However, some evidence
suggests that they may have actually developed a positional system as far back as the first
century C.E.

The Indians were not the first to use a positional system. The Babylonians (as we will see in
Chapter 3) used a positional system with 60 as their base. However, there is not much
evidence that the Babylonian system had much impact on later numeral systems, except with
the Greeks. Also, the Chinese had a base-10 system, probably derived from the use of a
counting board24. Some believe that the positional system used in India was derived from the
Chinese system.

Wherever it may have originated, it appears that around 600 C.E., the Indians abandoned the
use of symbols for numbers higher than nine and began to use our familiar system where the
position of the symbol determines its overall value.25 Numerous documents from the seventh
century demonstrate the use of this positional system.

Interestingly, the earliest dated inscriptions using the system with a symbol for zero come
from Cambodia. In 683, the 605th year of the Saka era is written with three digits and a dot
in the middle. The 608th year uses three digits with a modern 0 in the middle.26 The dot as a
symbol for zero also appears in a Chinese work (Chiu-chih li). The author of this document
gives a strikingly clear description of how the Indian system works:

         Using the [Indian] numerals, multiplication and division are carried out. Each
         numeral is written in one stroke. When a number is counted to ten, it is advanced
         into the higher place. In each vacant place a dot is always put. Thus the numeral is
         always denoted in each place. Accordingly there can be no error in determining the
         place. With the numerals, calculations is easy..."27

Transmission to Europe
It is not completely known how the system got transmitted to Europe. Traders and travelers
of the Mediterranean coast may have carried it there. It is found in a tenth-century Spanish
manuscript and may have been introduced to Spain by the Arabs, who invaded the region in
711 C.E. and were there until 1492.

In many societies, a division formed between those who used numbers and calculation for
practical, every day business and those who used them for ritualistic purposes or for state
business.28 The former might often use older systems while the latter were inclined to use
the newer, more elite written numbers. Competition between the two groups arose and
continued for quite some time.
   344

   In a 14th century manuscript of Boethius' The
   Consolations of Philosophy, there appears a
   well-known drawing of two mathematicians. One is a
   merchant and is using an abacus (the "abacist"). The
   other is a Pythagorean philosopher (the "algorist")
   using his "sacred" numbers. They are in a competition
   that is being judged by the goddess of number. By
   1500 C.E., however, the newer symbols and system
   had won out and has persevered until today. The
   Seattle Times recently reported that the Hindu-Arabic
   numeral system has been included in the book The
   Greatest Inventions of the Past 2000 Years.29

   One question to answer is why the Indians would
   develop such a positional notation. Unfortunately, an
   answer to that question is not currently known. Some
   suggest that the system has its origins with the Chinese
   counting boards. These boards were portable and it is thought that Chinese travelers who
   passed through India took their boards with them and ignited an idea in Indian
   mathematics.30 Others, such as G. G. Joseph propose that it is the Indian fascination with
   very large numbers that drove them to develop a system whereby these kinds of big numbers
   could easily be written down. In this theory, the system developed entirely within the Indian
   mathematical framework without considerable influence from other civilizations.

The Development and Use of Different Number Bases

   Introduction and Basics
   During the previous discussions, we have been referring to positional base systems. In this
   section of the chapter, we will explore exactly what a base system is and what it means if a
   system is "positional." We will do so by first looking at our own familiar, base-ten system
   and then deepen our exploration by looking at other possible base systems. In the next part
   of this section, we will journey back to Mayan civilization and look at their unique base
   system, which is based on the number 20 rather than the number 10.

   A base system is a structure within which we count. The easiest way to describe a base
   system is to think about our own base-ten system. The base-ten system, which we call the
   "decimal" system, requires a total of ten different symbols/digits to write any number. They
   are, of course, 0, 1, 2, ..... 9.

   The decimal system is also an example of a positional base system, which simply means that
   the position of a digit gives its place value. Not all civilizations had a positional system even
   though they did have a base with which they worked.

   In our base-ten system, a number like 5,783,216 has meaning to us because we are familiar
   with the system and its places. As we know, there are six ones, since there is a 6 in the ones
   place. Likewise, there are seven "hundred thousands," since the 7 resides in that place. Each
                            Historical Counting Systems 345

digit has a value that is explicitly determined by its position within the number. We make a
distinction between digit, which is just a symbol such as 5, and a number, which is made up
of one or more digits. We can take this number and assign each of its digits a value. One
way to do this is with a table, which follows:

5,000,000  = 5 × 1,000,000  = 5 × 106 Five million
+700,000
+80,000    = 7 × 100,000    = 7 × 105 Seven hundred thousand
+3,000
+200       = 8 × 10,000     = 8 × 104 Eighty thousand
+10
+6         = 3 × 1000       = 3 × 103 Three thousand
5,783,216
           = 2 × 100        = 2 × 102 Two hundred

           = 1 × 10         = 1 × 101 Ten

           = 6 × 1          = 6 × 100 Six

           Five million, seven hundred eighty-three thousand, two hundred sixteen

From the third column in the table we can see that each place is simply a multiple of ten. Of
course, this makes sense given that our base is ten. The digits that are multiplying each place
simply tell us how many of that place we have. We are restricted to having at most 9 in any
one place before we have to "carry" over to the next place. We cannot, for example, have 11
in the hundreds place. Instead, we would carry 1 to the thousands place and retain 1 in the
hundreds place. This comes as no surprise to us since we readily see that 11 hundreds is the
same as one thousand, one hundred. Carrying is a pretty typical occurrence in a base system.

However, base-ten is not the only option we have. Practically any positive integer greater
than or equal to 2 can be used as a base for a number system. Such systems can work just
like the decimal system except the number of symbols will be different and each position will
depend on the base itself.

Other Bases

For example, let's suppose we adopt a base-five system. The only modern digits we would
need for this system are 0,1,2,3 and 4. What are the place values in such a system? To
answer that, we start with the ones place, as most base systems do. However, if we were to
count in this system, we could only get to four (4) before we had to jump up to the next
place. Our base is 5, after all! What is that next place that we would jump to? It would not
be tens, since we are no longer in base-ten. We're in a different numerical world. As the
base-ten system progresses from 100 to101, so the base-five system moves from 50 to 51 = 5.
Thus, we move from the ones to the fives.

After the fives, we would move to the 52 place, or the twenty fives. Note that in base-ten,
we would have gone from the tens to the hundreds, which is, of course, 102.

Let's take an example and build a table. Consider the number 30412 in base five. We will
write this as 304125 , where the subscript 5 is not part of the number but indicates the base
we're using. First off, note that this is NOT the number "thirty thousand, four hundred
twelve." We must be careful not to impose the base-ten system on this number. Here's
346

what our table might look like. We will use it to convert this number to our more familiar
base-ten system.

     Base 5 This column coverts to base-ten In Base-Ten

     3 × 54 = 3 × 625                    = 1875

     + 0 × 53 = 0 × 125                  = 0

     + 4 × 52 = 4 × 25                   = 100

     + 1 × 51 = 1 × 5                    = 5

     + 2 × 50 = 2 × 1                    = 2

     Total                               1982

As you can see, the number 304125 is equivalent to 1,982 in base-ten. We will say 304125 =
198210. All of this may seem strange to you, but that's only because you are so used to the
only system that you've ever seen.

Example 3
     Convert 62347 to a base 10 number.

We first note that we are given a base-7 number that we are to convert. Thus, our places will
start at the ones (70), and then move up to the 7's, 49's (72), etc. Here's the breakdown:

     Base 7 Convert Base 10

     = 6 × 73 = 6 × 343 = 2058

+ = 2 × 72 = 2 × 49 = 98

+ = 3 × 7 = 3 × 7 = 21

+ =4×1 =4×1 =4

     Total             2181

Thus 62347 = 218110

Converting from Base 10 to Other Bases

Converting from an unfamiliar base to the familiar decimal system is not that difficult once
you get the hang of it. It's only a matter of identifying each place and then multiplying each
digit by the appropriate power. However, going the other direction can be a little trickier.
Suppose you have a base-ten number and you want to convert to base-five. Let's start with
some simple examples before we get to a more complicated one.
                                                                        Historical Counting Systems 347

Example 4
     Convert twelve to a base-five number.

     We can probably easily see that we can rewrite this number as follows:
      12 = (2 × 5) + (2 × 1)

     Hence, we have two fives and 2 ones. Hence, in base-five we would write twelve as 225.
     Thus, 1210 = 225.

Example 5
     Convert sixty-nine to a base-five number.

     We can see now that we have more than 25, so we rewrite sixty-nine as follows:
      69 = (2 × 25) + (3 × 5) + (4 × 1)

     Here, we have two twenty-fives, 3 fives, and 4 ones. Hence, in base five we have 234. Thus,
     6910 = 2345.

Example 6
     Convert the base-seven number 32617 to base 10.

     The powers of 7 are:
      70 = 1
      71 = 7
      72 = 49
      73 = 343
      Etc...

     32617 = (3×343) + (2×49) + (6×7) + (1×1) = 117010.
     Thus 32617 = 117010.

     In general, when converting from base-ten to some other base, it is often helpful to
     determine the highest power of the base that will divide into the given number at least once.
     In the last example, 52 = 25 is the largest power of five that is present in 69, so that was our
     starting point. If we had moved to 53 = 125, then 125 would not divide into 69 at least once.
     348

         Converting from Base 10 to Base b
         1. Find the highest power of the base b that will divide into the given number at least

             once and then divide.
         2. Write down the whole number part, then use the remainder from division in the

             next step.
         3. Repeat step two, dividing by the next highest power of the base b, writing down the

             whole number part (including 0), and using the remainder in the next step.
         4. Continue until the remainder is smaller than the base. This last remainder will be

             in the "ones" place.
         5. Collect all your whole number parts to get your number in base b notation.

Example 7
     Convert the base-ten number 348 to base-five.

     The powers of five are:
      50 = 1
      51 = 5
      52 = 25
      53 = 125
      54 = 625
      Etc...

     Since 348 is smaller than 625, but bigger than 125, we see that 53=125 is the highest power
     of five present in 348. So we divide 125 into 348 to see how many of them there are:
      348÷125 = 2 with remainder 98

     We write down the whole part, 2, and continue with the remainder. There are 98 left over, so
     we see how many 25's (the next smallest power of five) there are in the remainder:
      98÷25 = 3 with remainder 23

     We write down the whole part, 2, and continue with the remainder. There are 23 left over, so
     we look at the next place, the 5's:
      23÷5 = 4 with remainder 3

     This leaves us with 3, which is less than our base, so this number will be in the "ones" place.
     We are ready to assemble our base-five number:
      348 = (2×53) + (3×52) + (4×51) + (3×1)

     Hence, our base-five number is 2343. We'll say that 34810 = 23435.

Example 8
     Convert the base-ten number 4,509 to base-seven.

The powers of 7 are:

70 = 1
71 = 7
72 = 49
73 = 343
74 = 2401
75 = 16807

Etc...

The highest power of 7 that will divide into 4,509 is 74 = 2401.

With division, we see that it will go in 1 time with a remainder of 2108. So we have 1 in the
74 place.

The next power down is 73 = 343, which goes into 2108 six times with a new remainder of
50. So we have 6 in the 73 place.

The next power down is 72 = 49, which goes into 50 once with a new remainder of 1. So

there is a 1 in the 72 place.

The next power down is 71 but there was only a remainder of 1,      4,509 ÷ 74 = 1 R 2108
                                                                    2108 ÷ 73 = 6 R 50

so that means there is a 0 in the 7's place and we still have 1 as  50 ÷ 72=  1 R 1
a remainder.                                                        1 ÷ 71 =  0 R 1

That, of course, means that we have 1 in the ones place.            1 ÷ 70 =  1

Putting all of this together means that 4,50910 = 161017.           4,50910 = 161017

Another Method For Converting From Base 10 to Other Bases
As you read the solution to this last example and attempted the "Try it Now" problems, you
may have had to repeatedly stop and think about what was going on. The fact that you are
probably struggling to follow the explanation and reproduce the process yourself is mostly
due to the fact that the non-decimal systems are so unfamiliar to you. In fact, the only system
that you are probably comfortable with is the decimal system.
350

As budding mathematicians, you should always be asking questions like "How could I
simplify this process?" In general, that is one of the main things that mathematicians
do...they look for ways to take complicated situations and make them easier or more
familiar. In this section we will attempt to do that.

To do so, we will start by looking at our own decimal system. What we do may seem
obvious and maybe even intuitive but that's the point. We want to find a process that we
readily recognize works and makes sense to us in a familiar system and then use it to extend
our results to a different, unfamiliar system.

Let's start with the decimal number, 486310. We will convert this number to base 10. Yeah,
I know it's already in base 10, but if you carefully follow what we're doing, you'll see it
makes things work out very nicely with other bases later on. We first note that the highest
power of 10 that will divide into 4863 at least once is 103 = 1000. In general, this is the first
step in our new process; we find the highest power that a given base that will divide at least
once into our given number.

We now divide 1000 into 4863:

                                            4863 ÷ 1000 = 4.863

This says that there are four thousands in 4863 (obviously). However, it also says that there
are 0.863 thousands in 4863. This fractional part is our remainder and will be converted to
lower powers of our base (10). If we take that decimal and multiply by 10 (since that's the
base we're in) we get the following:

                                              0.863 × 10 = 8.63

Why multiply by 10 at this point? We need to recognize here that 0.863 thousands is the
same as 8.63 hundreds. Think about that until it sinks in.

                                            (0.863)(1000) = 863
                                            (8.63)(100) = 863

These two statements are equivalent. So, what we are really doing here by multiplying by 10
is rephrasing or converting from one place (thousands) to the next place down (hundreds).

                                              0.863×10  8.63
                                (Parts of Thousands) × 10  Hundreds

What we have now is 8 hundreds and a remainder of 0.63 hundreds, which is the same as 6.3
tens. We can do this again with the 0.63 that remains after this first step.

                                              0.63 × 10  6.3
                                          Hundreds × 10  Tens

So we have six tens and 0.3 tens, which is the same as 3 ones, our last place value.
                                                                        Historical Counting Systems 351

     Now here's the punch line. Let's put all of the together in one place:

                                           4863 ÷ 1000 = .863

                                             0.863 × 10 = .63

                                              0.63 × 10 = .3

                                                0.3 × 10 = .0

     Note that in each step, the remainder is carried down to the next step and multiplied by 10,
     the base. Also, at each step, the whole number part, which is circled, gives the digit that
     belongs in that particular place. What is amazing is that this works for any base! So, to
     convert from a base 10 number to some other base, b, we have the following steps we can
     follow:

         Converting from Base 10 to Base b: Another method
         1. Find the highest power of the base b that will divide into the given number at least

             once and then divide.
         2. Keep the whole number part, and multiply the fractional part by the base b.
         3. Repeat step two, keeping the whole number part (including 0), carrying the

             fractional part to the next step until only a whole number result is obtained.
         4. Collect all your whole number parts to get your number in base b notation.

     We will illustrate this procedure with some examples.

Example 9
     Convert the base 10 number, 34810, to base 5.

     This is actually a conversion that we have done in a previous example. The powers of five
     are:

      50 = 1
      51 = 5
      52 = 25
      53 = 125
      54 = 625
      Etc...

     The highest power of five that will go into 348 at least once is 53.
     352

     We divide by 125 and then proceed.
              348 ÷ 53 = .784

              0.784 × 5 = .92

              0.92 × 5 = 0.6

              0.6 × 5 = .0

     By keeping all the whole number parts, from top bottom, gives 2343 as our base 5 number.
     Thus, 23435 = 34810.

     We can compare our result with what we saw earlier, or simply check with our calculator,
     and find that these two numbers really are equivalent to each other.

Example 10
     Convert the base 10 number, 300710, to base 5.
     The highest power of 5 that divides at least once into 3007 is 54 = 625. Thus, we have:

              3007 ÷ 625 = .8112
              0.8112 × 5 = .056
              0.056 × 5 = .28
              0.28 × 5 = 0.4
              0.4 × 5 = 0.0

     This gives us that 300710 = 440125. Notice that in the third line that multiplying by 5 gave us
     0 for our whole number part. We don't discard that! The zero tells us that a zero in that
     place. That is, there are no 52's in this number.

     This last example shows the importance of using a calculator in certain situations and taking
     care to avoid clearing the calculator's memory or display until you get to the very end of the
     process.
                                                                        Historical Counting Systems 353

Example 11
     Convert the base 10 number, 6320110, to base 7.

     The powers of 7 are:

      70 = 1
      71 = 7
      72 = 49
      73 = 343
      74 = 2401
      75 = 16807
      etc...

     The highest power of 7 that will divide at least once into 63201 is 75. When we do the initial
     division on a calculator, we get the following:

      63201 ÷ 75 = 3.760397453

     The decimal part actually fills up the calculators display and we don't know if it terminates at
     some point or perhaps even repeats down the road. So if we clear our calculator at this point,
     we will introduce error that is likely to keep this process from ever ending. To avoid this
     problem, we leave the result in the calculator and simply subtract 3 from this to get the
     fractional part all by itself. DO NOT ROUND OFF! Subtraction and then multiplication by
     seven gives:

              63201 ÷ 75 = .760397453
              0.760397453 × 7 = .322782174
              0. 322782174 × 7 =.259475219
              0.259475219 × 7 =.816326531
              0. 816326531 × 7 = .714285714
              0. 714285714 × 7 = .000000000

     Yes, believe it or not, that last product is exactly 5, as long as you don't clear anything out
     on your calculator. This gives us our final result: 6320110 = 3521557.

     If we round, even to two decimal places in each step, clearing our calculator out at each step
     along the way, we will get a series of numbers that do not terminate, but begin repeating
     themselves endlessly. (Try it!) We end up with something that doesn't make any sense, at
     least not in this context. So be careful to use your calculator cautiously on these conversion
     problems.

     Also, remember that if your first division is by 75, then you expect to have 6 digits in the
     final answer, corresponding to the places for 75, 74, and so on down to 70. If you find
     yourself with more than 6 digits due to rounding errors, you know something went wrong.

The Mayan Numeral System

   Background
   As you might imagine, the development of a base system is an important step in making the
   counting process more efficient. Our own base-ten system probably arose from the fact that
   we have 10 fingers (including thumbs) on two hands. This is a natural development.
   However, other civilizations have had a variety of bases other than ten. For example, the
   Natives of Queensland used a base-two system, counting as follows: "one, two, two and one,
   two two's, much." Some Modern South American Tribes have a base-five system counting
   in this way: "one, two, three, four, hand, hand and one, hand and two," and so on. The
   Babylonians used a base-sixty (sexigesimal) system. In this chapter, we wrap up with a
   specific example of a civilization that actually used a base system other than 10.

   The Mayan civilization is generally
   dated from 1500 B.C.E to 1700 C.E.
   The Yucatan Peninsula (see map31) in
   Mexico was the scene for the
   development of one of the most
   advanced civilizations of the ancient
   world. The Mayans had a
   sophisticated ritual system that was
   overseen by a priestly class. This class
   of priests developed a philosophy with
   time as divine and eternal.32 The
   calendar, and calculations related to it,
   were thus very important to the ritual
   life of the priestly class, and hence the
   Mayan people. In fact, much of what
   we know about this culture comes
   from their calendar records and
   astronomy data. Another important
   source of information on the Mayans is
   the writings of Father Diego de Landa,
   who went to Mexico as a missionary in
   1549.
                                                    Historical Counting Systems 355

There were two numeral systems developed by the Mayans - one for the common people and
one for the priests. Not only did these two systems use different symbols, they also used
different base systems. For the priests, the number system was governed by ritual. The days

                     of the year were thought to be gods, so the formal symbols for the days
                     were decorated heads,33 like the sample to the left34 Since the basic
                     calendar was based on 360 days, the priestly numeral system used a mixed
                     base system employing multiples of 20 and 360. This makes for a
                     confusing system, the details of which we will skip.

The Mayan Number System                             Powers  Base-Ten Value  Place Name
                                                            12,800,000,000
Instead, we will focus on the numeration system       207                   Hablat
of the "common" people, which used a more             206      64,000,000   Alau
consistent base system. As we stated earlier, the     205       3,200,000   Kinchil
Mayans used a base-20 system, called the              204        160,000    Cabal
"vigesimal" system. Like our system, it is            203                   Pic
positional, meaning that the position of a numeric    202         8,000     Bak
symbol indicates its place value. In the following    201          400      Kal
table you can see the place value in its vertical     200           20      Hun
format.35                                                            1

In order to write numbers down, there were
only three symbols needed in this system.
A horizontal bar represented the quantity 5,
a dot represented the quantity 1, and a
special symbol (thought to be a shell)
represented zero. The Mayan system may
have been the first to make use of zero as a
placeholder/number. The first 20 numbers
are shown in the table to the right.36

Unlike our system, where the ones place
starts on the right and then moves to the
left, the Mayan systems places the ones on
the bottom of a vertical orientation and
moves up as the place value increases.

When numbers are written in vertical form,
there should never be more than four dots
in a single place. When writing Mayan
numbers, every group of five dots becomes
one bar. Also, there should never be more
than three bars in a single place...four bars
would be converted to one dot in the next
place up. It's the same as 10 getting
converted to a 1 in the next place up when
we carry during addition.
     356

Example 12
     What is the value of this number, which is shown in vertical form?

     Starting from the bottom, we have the ones place. There are two bars and three dots in this
     place. Since each bar is worth 5, we have 13 ones when we count the three dots in the ones
     place. Looking to the place value above it (the twenties places), we see there are three dots
     so we have three twenties.

                                           20's
                                           1's
     Hence we can write this number in base-ten as:

   (3× 201 )+ (13× 200 ) = (3× 20)+ (13×1)

                             = 60 +13
                             = 73

Example 13
     What is the value of the following Mayan number?

     This number has 11 in the ones place, zero in the 20's place, and 18 in the 202=400's place.
     Hence, the value of this number in base-ten is:
     18×400 + 0×20 + 11×1 = 7211.

Example 14
     Convert the base 10 number 357510 to Mayan numerals.

     This problem is done in two stages. First we need to convert to a base 20 number. We will
     do so using the method provided in the last section of the text. The second step is to convert
     that number to Mayan symbols.

     The highest power of 20 that will divide into 3575 is 202 = 400, so we start by dividing that
     and then proceed from there:

            3575 ÷ 400 = 8.9375
            0.9375 × 20 = 18.75
            0.75 × 20 = 15.0

     This means that 357510 = 8,18,1520

     The second step is to convert this to Mayan notation. This number indicates that we have 15
     in the ones position. That's three bars at the bottom of the number. We also have 18 in the
     20's place, so that's three bars and three dots in the second position. Finally, we have 8 in
     the 400's place, so that's one bar and three dots on the top. We get the following

     Note that in the previous example a new notation was used when we wrote 8,18,1520. The
     commas between the three numbers 8, 18, and 15 are now separating place values for us so
     that we can keep them separate from each other. This use of the comma is slightly different
     than how they're used in the decimal system. When we write a number in base 10, such as
     7,567,323, the commas are used primarily as an aide to read the number easily but they do
     not separate single place values from each other. We will need this notation whenever the
     base we use is larger than 10.

         Writing numbers with bases bigger than 10
         When the base of a number is larger than 10, separate each "digit" with a comma to
         make the separation of digits clear.

         For example, in base 20, to write the number corresponding to 17×202 + 6×201 +
         13×200, we'd write 17,6,1320.

     Adding Mayan Numbers
     When adding Mayan numbers together, we'll adopt a scheme that the Mayans probably did
     not use but which will make life a little easier for us.

Example 15
     Add, in Mayan, the numbers 37 and 29: 37

     First draw a box around each of the vertical places. This will help keep the place values from
     being mixed up.

     Next, put all of the symbols from both numbers into a single set of places (boxes), and to the
     right of this new number draw a set of empty boxes where you will place the final sum:

     You are now ready to start carrying. Begin with the place that has the lowest value, just as
     you do with Arabic numbers. Start at the bottom place, where each dot is worth 1. There are
     six dots, but a maximum of four are allowed in any one place; once you get to five dots, you
     must convert to a bar. Since five dots make one bar, we draw a bar through five of the dots,
     leaving us with one dot which is under the four-dot limit. Put this dot into the bottom place
     of the empty set of boxes you just drew:
                                                                   Historical Counting Systems 359

Now look at the bars in the bottom place. There are five, and the maximum number the place
can hold is three. Four bars are equal to one dot in the next highest place.
Whenever we have four bars in a single place we will automatically convert that to a dot in
the next place up. We draw a circle around four of the bars and an arrow up to the dots'
section of the higher place. At the end of that arrow, draw a new dot. That dot represents 20
just the same as the other dots in that place. Not counting the circled bars in the bottom
place, there is one bar left. One bar is under the three-bar limit; put it under the dot in the set
of empty places to the right.

Now there are only three dots in the next highest place, so draw them in the corresponding
empty box.

We can see here that we have 3 twenties (60), and 6 ones, for a total of 66. We check and
note that 37 + 29 = 66, so we have done this addition correctly. Is it easier to just do it in
base-ten? Probably, but that's only because it's more familiar to you. Your task here is to
try to learn a new base system and how addition can be done in slightly different ways than
what you have seen in the past. Note, however, that the concept of carrying is still used, just
as it is in our own addition algorithm.

Try adding 174 and 78 in Mayan by first converting to Mayan numbers and then working
entirely within that system. Do not add in base-ten (decimal) until the very end when you
check your work.

Conclusion
In this chapter, we have briefly sketched the development of numbers and our counting
system, with the emphasis on the "brief" part. There are numerous sources of information
and research that fill many volumes of books on this topic. Unfortunately, we cannot begin
to come close to covering all of the information that is out there.
We have only scratched the surface of the wealth of research and information that exists on
the development of numbers and counting throughout human history. What is important to
360

note is that the system that we use every day is a product of thousands of years of progress
and development. It represents contributions by many civilizations and cultures. It does not
come down to us from the sky, a gift from the gods. It is not the creation of a textbook
publisher. It is indeed as human as we are, as is the rest of mathematics. Behind every
symbol, formula and rule there is a human face to be found, or at least sought.

Furthermore, we hope that you now have a basic appreciation for just how interesting and
diverse number systems can get. Also, we're pretty sure that you have also begun to
recognize that we take our own number system for granted so much that when we try to
adapt to other systems or bases, we find ourselves truly having to concentrate and think about
what is going on.

James Bidwell has suggested that Mayan addition was done by "simply combining bars and
dots and carrying to the next higher place." He goes on to say, "After the combining of dots
and bars, the second step is to exchange every five dots for one bar in the same position."

course), perform the indicated addition:

Four binary digits together can represent any base-10 number from 0 to 15. To create a
more human-readable representation of binary-coded numbers, hexadecimal numbers, base
16, are commonly used. Instead of using the 8,13,1216 notation used earlier, the letter A is
used to represent the digit 10, B for 11, up to F for 15, so 8,13,1216 would be written as 8DC.

Fractals

     Fractals are mathematical sets, usually obtained through recursion, that exhibit interesting
     dimensional properties. We'll explore what that sentence means through the rest of the
     chapter. For now, we can begin with the idea of self-similarity, a characteristic of most
     fractals.

         Self-similarity
         A shape is self-similar when it looks essentially the same from a distance as it does
         closer up.

     Self-similarity can often be found in nature. In the Romanesco broccoli pictured below1, if
     we zoom in on part of the image, the piece remaining looks similar to the whole.

Likewise, in the fern frond below2, one piece of the frond looks similar to the whole.

Similarly, if we zoom in on the coastline of Portugal3, each zoom reveals previously hidden
detail, and the coastline, while not identical to the view from further way, does exhibit
similar characteristics.

 Iterated Fractals
     This self-similar behavior can be replicated through recursion: repeating a process over and
     over.

Example 1
     Suppose that we start with a filled-in triangle. We connect the midpoints of each side and
     remove the middle triangle. We then repeat this process.

     Initial  Step 1  Step 2  Step 3

If we repeat this process, the shape that emerges is called the Sierpinski gasket. Notice that it
exhibits self-similarity - any piece of the gasket will look identical to the whole. In fact, we
can say that the Sierpinski gasket contains three copies of itself, each half as tall and wide as
the original. Of course, each of those copies also contains three copies of itself.

We can construct other fractals using a similar approach. To formalize this a bit, we're going
to introduce the idea of initiators and generators.

    Initiators and Generators
   An initiator is a starting shape
   A generator is an arranged collection of scaled copies of the initiator
                                                                                                  Fractals 369

     To generate fractals from initiators and generators, we follow a simple rule:
         Fractal Generation Rule
         At each step, replace every copy of the initiator with a scaled copy of the generator,
         rotating as necessary

     This process is easiest to understand through example.

Example 2
     Use the initiator and generator shown to create the iterated fractal.

initiator  generator

This tells us to, at each step, replace each line segment with the spiked shape shown in the
generator. Notice that the generator itself is made up of 4 copies of the initiator. In step 1,
the single line segment in the initiator is replaced with the generator. For step 2, each of the
four line segments of step 1 is replaced with a scaled copy of the generator:

Step 1     Scaled copy   A scaled copy                         Step 2
           of generator  replaces each line
                         segment of Step 1

This process is repeated to form Step 3. Again, each line segment is replaced with a scaled
copy of the generator.

Step 2     Scaled copy   Step 3
           of generator

Notice that since Step 0 only had 1 line segment, Step 1 only required one copy of Step 0.
Since Step 1 had 4 line segments, Step 2 required 4 copies of the generator.
Step 2 then had 16 line segments, so Step 3 required 16 copies of the generator.
Step 4, then, would require 16*4 = 64 copies of the generator.

The shape resulting from iterating this process is called the  Koch curve
Koch curve, named for Helge von Koch who first explored it
in 1904.
370
Notice that the Sierpinski gasket can also be described using the initiator-generator approach

Initiator  Generator

Example 3
     Use the initiator and generator below, however only iterate on the "branches." Sketch
     several steps of the iteration.

initiator  generator

We begin by replacing the initiator with the generator. We then replace each "branch" of
Step 1 with a scaled copy of the generator to create Step 2.

Step 1     Step 2

We can repeat this process to create later steps. Repeating this process can create intricate
tree shapes4.

Using iteration processes like those above can create a variety of beautiful images evocative
of nature56.

     More natural shapes can be created by adding in randomness to the steps.

Example 4
     Create a variation on the Sierpinski gasket by randomly skewing the corner points each time
     an iteration is made.

     Suppose we start with the triangle below. We begin, as before, by removing the middle
     triangle. We then add in some randomness.

             Step 0           Step 1                                       Step 1 with

Continuing this process can create mountain-like
structures.

The landscape to the right7 was created using fractals,
then colored and textured.

Fractal Dimension
   In addition to visual self-similarity, fractals exhibit other interesting properties. For example,
   notice that each step of the Sierpinski gasket iteration removes one quarter of the remaining
   area. If this process is continued indefinitely, we would end up essentially removing all the
   area, meaning we started with a 2-dimensional area, and somehow end up with something
   less than that, but seemingly more than just a 1-dimensional line.

To explore this idea, we need to discuss dimension. Something like a line is 1-dimensional;
it only has length. Any curve is 1-dimensional. Things like boxes and circles are 2-
dimensional, since they have length and width, describing an area. Objects like boxes and
cylinders have length, width, and height, describing a volume, and are 3-dimensional.

     1-dimensional     2-dimensional                         3-dimensional

Certain rules apply for scaling objects, related to their dimension.

If I had a line with length 1, and wanted scale its length by 2, I would need two copies of the
original line. If I had a line of length 1, and wanted to scale its length by 3, I would need
three copies of the original.

If I had a rectangle with length 2 and height 1, and wanted to scale its length and width by 2,

I would need four copies of the original rectangle. If I wanted to scale the length and width

by 3, I would need nine copies of the original rectangle.

If I had a cubical box with sides of length 1, and wanted to scale its length and width by 2, I
would need eight copies of the original cube. If I wanted to scale the length and width by 3, I
would need 27 copies of the original cube.

           2 2                        3 3

Notice that in the 1-dimensional case, copies needed = scale.
In the 2-dimensional case, copies needed = scale2.
In the 3-dimensional case, copies needed = scale3.

From these examples, we might infer a pattern.

Scaling-Dimension Relation
To scale a D-dimensional shape by a scaling factor S, the number of copies C of the
original shape needed will be given by:

     Copies = ScaleDimension , or C = SD

Example 5
     Use the scaling-dimension relation to determine the dimension of the Sierpinski gasket.

Suppose we define the original gasket to have side
length 1. The larger gasket shown is twice as wide
and twice as tall, so has been scaled by a factor of 2.

Notice that to construct the larger gasket, 3 copies of       1

the original gasket are needed.                                              2

Using the scaling-dimension relation C = SD, we obtain the equation 3 = 2D.

Since 21 = 2 and 22 = 4, we can immediately see that D is somewhere between 1 and 2; the
gasket is more than a 1-dimensional shape, but we've taken away so much area its now less
than 2-dimensional.
374

Solving the equation 3 = 2D requires logarithms. If you studied logarithms earlier, you may
recall how to solve this equation (if not, just skip to the box below and use that formula):

3 = 2D             Take the logarithm of both sides
                   Use the exponent property of logs
log(3) = log(2D )  Divide by log(2)

log(3) = D log(2)  The dimension of the gasket is about 1.585
D = log(3)  1.585

     log(2)

Scaling-Dimension Relation, to find Dimension
To find the dimension D of a fractal, determine the scaling factor S and the number of
copies C of the original shape needed, then use the formula

D = log(C)

      log(S )

   We will now turn our attention to another type of fractal, defined by a different type of
   recursion. To understand this type, we are first going to need to discuss complex numbers.

Complex Numbers8
   The numbers you are most familiar with are called real numbers. These include numbers
   like 4, 275, -200, 10.7, ½, , and so forth. All these real numbers can be plotted on a number
   line. For example, if we wanted to show the number 3, we plot a point:

To solve certain problems like x2 = -4, it became necessary to introduce imaginary
numbers.

Imaginary Number i

The imaginary number i is defined to be i = -1 .
Any real multiple of i, like 5i, is also an imaginary number.

Example 6
     Simplify - 9 .

We can separate - 9 as  9 -1 . We can take the square root of 9, and write the square
root of -1 as i.

  - 9 = 9 -1 = 3i

A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number.

   Complex Number
   A complex number is a number z = a + bi , where a and b are real numbers
   a is the real part of the complex number
   b is the imaginary part of the complex number

To plot a complex number like 3 - 4i , we need more than just a number line since there are
two components to the number. To plot this number, we need two number lines, crossed to
form a complex plane.

Complex Plane                                                             imaginary
In the complex plane, the horizontal axis is the                                    real
real axis and the vertical axis is the imaginary axis.

Example 7                                                                 imaginary
     Plot the number 3 - 4i on the complex plane.                                  real

     The real part of this number is 3, and the imaginary part is -4.
     To plot this, we draw a point 3 units to the right of the origin in
     the horizontal direction and 4 units down in the vertical
     direction.
     376

     Because this is analogous to the Cartesian coordinate system for plotting points, we can think
     about plotting our complex number z = a + bi as if we were plotting the point (a, b) in
     Cartesian coordinates. Sometimes people write complex numbers as z = x + yi to highlight
     this relation.

     Arithmetic on Complex Numbers
     Before we dive into the more complicated uses of complex numbers, let's make sure we
     remember the basic arithmetic involved. To add or subtract complex numbers, we simply
     add the like terms, combining the real parts and combining the imaginary parts.

Example 8
     Add 3 - 4i and 2 + 5i .

     Adding (3 - 4i) + (2 + 5i) , we add the real parts and the imaginary parts
     3 + 2 - 4i + 5i
     5+i

Try it Now 3
Subtract 2 + 5i from 3 - 4i

When we add complex numbers, we can visualize the addition as a shift, or translation, of a
point in the complex plane.

Example 9                                                            imaginary
     Visualize the addition 3 - 4i and -1+ 5i .
                                                                             2 + 1i
     The initial point is 3 - 4i . When we add -1+ 3i , we add -1                     real
     to the real part, moving the point 1 units to the left, and we
     add 5 to the imaginary part, moving the point 5 units
     vertically. This shifts the point 3 - 4i to 2 +1i

                                                                     3 - 4i

We can also multiply complex numbers by a real number, or multiply two complex numbers.

Example 10
     Multiply: 4(2 + 5i) .

To multiply the complex number by a real number, we simply distribute as we would when
multiplying polynomials.

4(2 + 5i)                   Distribute
                            Simplify
= 4  2 + 4  5i
= 8 + 20i

Example 11                        Expand     -1 , i 2 = -1
     Multiply: (2 + 5i)(4 + i) .
                                  Since i =
     (2 + 5i)(4 + i)              Simplify
     =8 + 20i + 2i + 5i2
     =8 + 20i + 2i + 5(-1)

Multiply 3 - 4i and 2 + 3i .

To understand the effect of multiplication visually, we'll explore three examples.

     Visualize the product 2(1+ 2i)                                   2 +4i

     Multiplying we'd get                                          1 + 2i
     2 1+ 2  2i                                                                       real
     = 2 + 4i

     Notice both the real and imaginary parts have been
     scaled by 2. Visually, this will stretch the point
     outwards, away from the origin.
     378                                                                  imaginary

Example 13                                                        -2 + i        1 + 2i
     Visualize the product i(1+ 2i)                                                        real

     Multiplying, we'd get
     i 1+ i  2i
     = i + 2i2
     = i + 2(-1)
     = -2 + i

     In this case, the distance from the origin has not
     changed, but the point has been rotated about the
     origin, 90° counter-clockwise.

Example 14

Visualize the result of multiplying 1+ 2i by 1+ i . Then show the result of multiplying by

1+ i again.                                                       imaginary

Multiplying 1+ 2i by 1+ i ,  -4+2i                                -1+3i
(1 + 2i)(1 + i)
                                                                          1+2i
= 1 + i + 2i + 2i 2

= 1 + 3i + 2(-1)

= -1 + 3i                                                                            real

Multiplying by 1 + i again,                              -6 - 2i
(-1 + 3i)(1 + i)
= -1 - i + 3i + 3i 2
= -1 + 2i + 3(-1)
= -4 + 2i

If we multiplied by 1+i again, we'd get -6-2i. Plotting these numbers in the complex plane,
you may notice that each point gets both further from the origin, and rotates
counterclockwise, in this case by 45°.

In general, multiplication by a complex number can be thought of as a scaling, changing the
distance from the origin, combined with a rotation about the origin.

Complex Recursive Sequences
   We will now explore recursively defined sequences of complex numbers.
                                                                                         Fractals 379

Recursive Sequence
A recursive relationship is a formula which relates the next value, zn+1 , in a sequence
to the previous value, zn . In addition to the formula, we need an initial value, z0 .

The sequence of values produced is the recursive sequence.

Example 15                                            z0 = 4 , generate several terms of the
     Given the recursive relationship zn+1 = zn + 2,
     recursive sequence.

We are given the starting value, z0 = 4 . The recursive formula holds for any value of n, so
if n = 0, then zn+1 = zn + 2 would tell us z0+1 = z0 + 2 , or more simply, z1 = z0 + 2 .

Notice this defines z1 in terms of the known z0 , so we can compute the value:
z1 = z0 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 .

Now letting n = 1, the formula tells us z1+1 = z1 + 2 , or z2 = z1 + 2 . Again, the formula gives
the next value in the sequence in terms of the previous value.
z2 = z1 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8

Continuing,
z3 = z2 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10
z4 = z3 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12

The previous example generated a basic linear sequence of real numbers. The same process
can be used with complex numbers.

Example 16                                                     z0 = 4 , generate several terms of the
     Given the recursive relationship zn+1 = zn  i + (1 - i),
     recursive sequence.

We are given z0 = 4 . Using the recursive formula:
z1 = z0  i + (1 - i) = 4  i + (1 - i) = 1 + 3i
z2 = z1  i + (1 - i) = (1 + 3i)  i + (1 - i) = i + 3i 2 + (1 - i) = i - 3 + (1 - i) = -2
z3 = z2  i + (1 - i) = (-2)  i + (1 - i) = -2i + (1 - i) = 1 - 3i
z4 = z3  i + (1 - i) = (1 - 3i)  i + (1 - i) = i - 3i 2 + (1 - i) = i + 3 + (1 - i) = 4
z5 = z4  i + (1 - i) = 4  i + (1 - i) = 1 + 3i

Notice this sequence is exhibiting an interesting pattern - it began to repeat itself.

 Mandelbrot Set
     The Mandelbrot Set is a set of numbers defined based on recursive sequences

         Mandelbrot Set
         For any complex number c, define the sequence zn+1 = zn 2 + c, z0 = 0

         If this sequence always stays close to the origin (within 2 units), then the number c is
         part of the Mandelbrot Set. If the sequence gets far from the origin, then the number c
         is not part of the set.

Example 17
     Determine if c = 1 + i is part of the Mandelbrot set.

     We start with z0 = 0 . We continue, omitting some detail of the calculations
      z1 = z02 + 1 + i = 0 + 1 + i = 1 + i
      z2 = z12 + 1 + i = (1 + i)2 + 1 + i = 1 + 3i
      z3 = z2 2 + 1 + i = (1 + 3i)2 + 1 + i = -7 + 7i
      z4 = z32 + 1 + i = (-7 + 7i)2 + 1 + i = 1 - 97i

     We can already see that these values are getting quite large. It does not appear that c = 1 + i
     is part of the Mandelbrot set.

Example 18
     Determine if c = 0.5i is part of the Mandelbrot set.

     We start with z0 = 0 . We continue, omitting some detail of the calculations
      z1 = z0 2 + 0.5i = 0 + 0.5i = 0.5i
      z2 = z12 + 0.5i = (0.5i)2 + 0.5i = -0.25 + 0.5i
      z3 = z2 2 + 0.5i = (-0.25 + 0.5i)2 + 0.5i = -0.1875 + 0.25i
      z4 = z32 + 0.5i = (-0.1875 + 0.25i)2 + 0.5i = -0.02734 + 0.40625i

     While not definitive with this few iterations, it does appear that this value is remaining small,
     suggesting that 0.5i is part of the Mandelbrot set.

If all complex numbers are tested, and we plot each
number that is in the Mandelbrot set on the
complex plane, we obtain the shape to the right9.
The boundary of this shape exhibits quasi-self-
similarity, in that portions look very similar to the
whole.
In addition to coloring the Mandelbrot set itself
black, it is common to the color the points in the
complex plane surrounding the set. To create a meaningful coloring, often people count the
number of iterations of the recursive sequence that are required for a point to get further than
2 units away from the origin. For example, using c = 1 + i above, the sequence was distance
2 from the origin after only two recursions.
For some other numbers, it may take tens or hundreds of iterations for the sequence to get far
from the origin. Numbers that get big fast are colored one shade, while colors that are slow
to grow are colored another shade. For example, in the image below10, light blue is used for
numbers that get large quickly, while darker shades are used for numbers that grow more
slowly. Greens, reds, and purples can be seen when we zoom in - those are used for
numbers that grow very slowly.

The Mandelbrot set, for having such a simple definition, exhibits immense complexity.
Zooming in on other portions of the set yields fascinating swirling shapes.

Exploration

The Julia Set for c is another fractal, related to the Mandelbrot set. The Julia Set for c uses
the recursive sequence: zn+1 = zn 2 + c, z0 = d , where c is constant for any particular Julia
set, and d is the number being tested. A value d is part of the Julia Set for c if the sequence
does not grow large.

For example, the Julia Set for -2 would be defined by zn+1 = zn 2 - 2, z0 = d . We then pick

values for d, and test each to determine if it is part of the Julia Set for -2. If so, we color
black the point in the complex plane corresponding with the number d. If not, we can color
the point d based on how fast it grows, like we did with the Mandelbrot Set.

For questions 33-34, you will probably want to use the online calculator again.

Cryptography

     When people need to secretly store or communicate messages, they turn to cryptography.
     Cryptography involves using techniques to obscure a message so outsiders cannot read the
     message. It is typically split into two steps: encryption, in which the message is obscured,
     and decryption, in which the original message is recovered from the obscured form.

 Substitution Ciphers
     One simple encryption method is called a substitution cipher.

         Substitution Cipher
         A substitution cipher replaces each letter in the message with a different letter,
         following some established mapping.

A simple example of a substitution cipher is called the Caesar cipher, sometimes called a
shift cipher. In this approach, each letter is replaced with a letter some fixed number of
positions later in the alphabet. For example, if we use a shift
of 3, then the letter A would be replaced with D, the letter 3
positions later in the alphabet. The entire mapping would
look like: 1

Original:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Maps to:   DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC

Example 1
     Use the Caesar cipher with shift of 3 to encrypt the message: "We ride at noon"

     We use the mapping above to replace each letter. W gets replaced with Z, and so forth,
     giving the encrypted message: ZH ULGH DW QRRQ.

     Notice that the length of the words could give an important clue to the cipher shift used. If
     we saw a single letter in the encrypted message, we would assume it must be an encrypted A
     or I, since those are the only single letters than form valid English words.

     To obscure the message, the letters are often rearranged into equal sized blocks. The
     message ZH ULGH DW QRRQ could be written in blocks of three characters as
     ZHU LGH DWQ RRQ.

Example 2
     Decrypt the message GZD KNK YDX MFW JXA if it was encrypted using a shift cipher
     with shift of 5.

We start by writing out the character mapping by shifting the alphabet, with A mapping to F,
five characters later in the alphabet.

Original:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Maps to:   FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDE

We now work backwards to decrypt the message. The first letter G is mapped to by B, so B
is the first character of the original message. Continuing, our decrypted message is
BUY FIF TYS HAR ESA.

Removing spaces we get BUYFIFTYSHARESA. In this case, it appears an extra character
was added to the end to make the groups of three come out even, and that the original
message was "Buy fifty shares."

Try it Now 1
Decrypt the message BNW MVX WNH if it was encrypted using a shift cipher with shift 9
(mapping A to J).

Notice that in both the ciphers above, the extra part of the
alphabet wraps around to the beginning. Because of this, a
handy version of the shift cipher is a cipher disc, such as the
Alberti cipher disk shown here2 from the 1400s. In a cipher
disc, the inner wheel could be turned to change the cipher shift.
This same approach is used for "secret decoder rings."

The security of a cryptographic method is very important to the
person relying on their message being kept secret. The security
depends on two factors:

    1. The security of the method being used
    2. The security of the encryption key used

In the case of a shift cipher, the method is "a shift cipher is used." The encryption key is the
specific amount of shift used.

Suppose an army is using a shift cipher to send their messages, and one of their officers is
captured by their enemy. It is likely the method and encryption key could become
compromised. It is relatively hard to change encryption methods, but relatively easy to
change encryption keys.

2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alberti_cipher_disk.JPG
                                                                                     Cryptography 389

During World War II, the Germans' Enigma encryption machines were captured, but having
details on the encryption method only slightly helped the Allies, since the encryption keys
were still unknown and hard to discover. Ultimately, the security of a message cannot rely
on the method being kept secret; it needs to rely on the key being kept secret.

   Encryption Security
   The security of any encryption method should depend only on the encryption key being
   difficult to discover. It is not safe to rely on the encryption method (algorithm) being
   kept secret.

With that in mind, let's analyze the security of the Caesar cipher.

Example 3.
     Suppose you intercept a message, and you know the sender is using a Caesar cipher, but do
     not know the shift being used. The message begins EQZP. How hard would it be to decrypt
     this message?

     Since there are only 25 possible shifts, we would only have to try 25 different possibilities to
     see which one produces results that make sense. While that would be tedious, one person
     could easily do this by hand in a few minutes. A modern computer could try all possibilities
     in under a second.

6      YKTJ     12     SEND     18     MYHX     24     GSBR
                                                25     FRAQ

In this case, a shift of 12 (A mapping to M) decrypts EQZP to SEND. Because of this ease
of trying all possible encryption keys, the Caesar cipher is not a very secure encryption
method.

Brute Force Attack
A brute force attack is a method for breaking encryption by trying all possible
encryption keys.

To make a brute force attack harder, we could make a more complex substitution cipher by
using something other than a shift of the alphabet. By choosing a random mapping, we could
get a more secure cipher, with the tradeoff that the encryption key is harder to describe; the
key would now be the entire mapping, rather than just the shift amount.
390

Example 4
     Use the substitution mapping below to encrypt the message "March 12 0300"

Original:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789
Maps to:   2BQF5WRTD8IJ6HLCOSUVK3A0X9YZN1G4ME7P

Using the mapping, the message would encrypt to 62SQT ZN Y1YY

Try it Now 2
Use the substitution mapping from Example 4 to decrypt the message C2SVX2VP

     While there were only 25 possible shift cipher keys (35 if we had included numbers), there
     are about 1040 possible substitution ciphers3. That's much more than a trillion trillions. It
     would be essentially impossible, even with supercomputers, to try every possible
     combination. Having a huge number of possible encryption keys is one important part of key
     security.

     Unfortunately, this cipher is still not secure,
     because of a technique called frequency
     analysis, discovered by Arab mathematician
     Al-Kindi in the 9th century. English and other
     languages have certain letters than show up
     more often in writing than others.4 For
     example, the letter E shows up the most
     frequently in English. The chart to the right
     shows the typical distribution of characters.

Example 5
     The chart to the right shows the frequency
     of different characters in some encrypted
     text. What can you deduce about the
     mapping?

     Because of the high frequency of the letter
     S in the encrypted text, it is very likely that
     the substitution maps E to S. Since W is
     the second most frequent character, it
     likely that T or A maps to W. Because C,
     A, D, and J show up rarely in the encrypted text, it is likely they are mapped to from J, Q, X,
     and Z.

      3 There are 35 choices for what A maps to, then 34 choices for what B maps to, and so on, so the total number
      of possibilities is 35*34*33*...*2*1 = 35! = about 1040

     In addition to looking at individual letters, certain pairs of letters show up more frequently,
     such as the pair "th." By analyzing how often different letters and letter pairs show up an
     encrypted message, the substitution mapping used can be deduced5.

 Transposition Ciphers
     Another approach to cryptography is transposition cipher.

         Transposition Ciphers
         A transposition cipher is one in which the order of characters is changed to obscure the
         message.

     An early version of a transposition cipher was a Scytale6, in which
     paper was wrapped around a stick and the message was written.
     Once unwrapped, the message would be unreadable until the
     message was wrapped around a same-sized stick again.

     One modern transposition cipher is done by writing the message in
     rows, then forming the encrypted message from the text in the columns.

Example 6
     Encrypt the message "Meet at First and Pine at midnight" using rows 8 characters long.

     We write the message in rows of 8 characters each. Nonsense characters are added to the end
     to complete the last row.

     MEETATFI
     RSTANDPI
     NEATMIDN
     IGHTPXNR

     We could then encode the message by recording down the columns. The first column,
     reading down, would be MRNI. All together, the encoded message would be MRNI ESEG
     ETAH TATT ANMP TDIX FPDN IINR. The spaces would be removed or repositioned to
     hide the size of table used, since that is the encryption key in this message.

Example 7
     Decrypt the message CEE IAI MNL NOG LTR VMH NW using the method above with a
     table with rows of 5 characters.

     Since there are total of 20 characters and each row should have 5 characters, then there will
     be 20/5 = 4 rows.

      5 For an example of how this is done, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis
      6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skytala%26EmptyStrip-Shaded.png
     392

     We start writing, putting the first 4 letters, CEEI, down the first column.

     CALLM
     EINTH
     EMORN
     INGVW

     We can now read the message: CALL ME IN THE MORNING VW. The VW is likely
     nonsense characters used to fill out the message.

     More complex versions of this rows-and-column based transposition cipher can be created by
     specifying an order in which the columns should be recorded. For example, the method
     could specify that after writing the message out in rows that you should record the third
     column, then the fourth, then the first, then the fifth, then the second. This adds additional
     complexity that would make it harder to make a brute-force attack.

     To make the encryption key easier to remember, a word could be used. For example, if the
     key word was "MONEY", it would specify that rows should have 5 characters each. The
     order of the letters in the alphabet would dictate which order to read the columns in. Since E,
     the 4th letter in the word, is the earliest letter in the alphabet from the word MONEY, the 4th
     column would be used first, followed by the 1st column (M), the 3rd column (N), the 2nd
     column (O), and the 5th column (Y).

Example 8
     Encrypt the message BUY SOME MILK AND EGGS using a transposition cipher with key
     word MONEY.

     Writing out the message in rows of 5 characters:
     BUYSO
     MEMIL
     KANDE
     GGSPK

     We now record the columns in order 4 1 3 2 5:
     SIDP BMKG YMNS UEAG OLEK
     As before, we'd then remove or reposition the spaces to conceal evidence of the encryption
     key.

     Try it Now 3
     Encrypt the message "Fortify the embassy" using a transposition cipher with key word HELP

     To decrypt a keyword-based transposition cipher, we'd reverse the process. In the example
     above, the keyword MONEY tells us to begin with the 4th column, so we'd start by writing
     SIDP down the 4th column, then continue to the 1st column, 3rd column, etc.
                                                                 Cryptography 393

Example 9
     Decrypt the message RHA VTN USR EDE AIE RIK ATS OQR using a row-and-column
     transposition cipher with keyword PRIZED.

The keyword PRIZED tells us to use rows with 6 characters. Since D comes first in the
alphabet, we start with 6th column. Since E is next in the alphabet, we'd follow with the 5th

column. Continuing, the word PRIZED tells us the message was recorded with the columns

in order 4 5 3 6 2 1.

For the decryption, we set up a table with 6 characters in each  R

row. Since the beginning of the encrypted message came           H

from the last column, we start writing the encrypted message     A

down the last column.                                            V

   Unfortunately, since the transposition cipher does not change the frequency of individual
   letters, it is still susceptible to frequency analysis, though the transposition does eliminate
   information from letter pairs.

Advanced shared symmetric-key methods
   Both the substitution and transposition methods discussed so far are shared symmetric-key
   methods, meaning that both sender and receiver would have to have agreed upon the same
   secret encryption key before any methods could be sent.

   All of the methods so far have been susceptible to frequency analysis since each letter is
   always mapped to the same encrypted character. More advanced methods get around this
   weakness. For example, the Enigma machines used in World War II had wheels that rotated.
   Each wheel was a substitution cipher, but the rotation would cause the substitution used to
   shift after each character.

   For a simplified example, in the initial setup, the wheel might provide the mapping
   Original: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789
   Maps to: 2BQF5WRTD8IJ6HLCOSUVK3A0X9YZN1G4ME7P
     394

     After the first character is encrypted, the wheel rotates, shifting the mapping one space,
     resulting in a new shifted mapping:
     Original: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789
     Maps to: P2BQF5WRTD8IJ6HLCOSUVK3A0X9YZN1G4ME7

     Using this approach, no letter gets encrypted as the same character over and over.

Example 10
     Encrypt the message "See me". Use a basic Caesar cipher with shift 3 as the initial
     substitution, but shift the substitution one place after each character.

     The initial mapping is
     Original: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
     Maps to: DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC

     This would map the first letter, S to V. We would then shift the mapping by one.
     Original: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
     Now maps to: EFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCD

     Now the next letter, E, will map to I. Again we shift the cipher
     Original: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
     Now maps to: FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDE

     The next letter, E, now maps to J. Continuing this process, the final message would be
     VIJSL.

     Notice that frequency analysis is much less useful now, since the character E has been
     mapped to three different characters due to the shifting of the substitution mapping.

     Decrypt the message KIQRV if it was encrypted using a basic Caesar cipher with shift 3 as
     the initial substitution, but shifting the substitution one place after each character.

     The actual Engima machines used in WWII were more
     complex. Each wheel consisted of a complex substitution
     cipher, and multiple wheels were used in a chain7. The
     specific wheels used, order of the wheels, and starting
     position of the wheels formed the encryption key. While
     captured Engima devices provided the Allied forces details
     on the encryption method, the keys still had to be broken to
     decrypt messages.

   These code breaking efforts led to the development of some of the first electronic computers
   by Alan Turing at Bletchley Park in the United Kingdom. This is generally considered the
   beginnings of modern computing8.

   In the 1970s, the U.S. government had a competition and ultimately approved an algorithm
   deemed DES (Data Encryption Standard) to be used for encrypting government data. It
   became the standard encryption algorithm used. This method used a combination of multiple
   substitution and transposition steps, along with other steps in which the encryption key is
   mixed with the message. This method uses an encryption key with length 56 bits, meaning
   there are 256 possible keys.

   This number of keys make a brute force attack extremely difficult and costly, but not
   impossible. In 1998, a team was able to find the decryption key for a message in 2 days,
   using about $250,000 worth of hardware. However, the price and time will go down as
   computer power increases.

   From 1997 to 2001 the government held another competition, ultimately adopting a new
   method, deemed AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). This method uses encryption keys
   with 128, 192, or 256 bits, providing up to 2256 possible keys, making brute force attacks
   essentially impossible.

Public Key Cryptography
   Suppose that you are connecting to your bank's website. It is possible that someone could
   intercept any communication between you and your bank, so you'll want to encrypt the
   communication. The problem is that all the encryption methods we've discussed require than
   both parties have already agreed on a shared secret encryption key. How can you and your
   bank agree on a key if you haven't already?

   This becomes the goal of public key cryptography - to provide a way for two parties to agree
   on a key without a snooping third party being able to determine the key. The method relies
   on a one-way function; something that is easy to do one way, but hard to reverse. We will
   explore the Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange method.

   As an example, let's consider mixing paint. It's easy to mix paint to make a new color, but
   much harder to separate a mixed paint into the two original colors used.910

396

Using this analogy, Alice and Bob publically
agree on a common starter color. Each then
mixes in some of their own secret color. They
then exchange their mixed colors.

Since separating colors is hard, even if a
snooper were to obtain these mixed colors, it
would be hard to obtain the original secret
colors.

Once they have exchanged their mixed colors,
Alice and Bob both add their secret color to
the mix they obtained from the other person.
In doing so, both Alice and Bob now have the
same common secret color, since it contains a
mix of the original common color, Alice's
secret color, and Bob's secret color.

They now have a common secret color they
can use as their encryption key, even though
neither Alice nor Bob knows the other's secret
color.
Likewise, there is no way for a snooper to
obtain the common secret color without
separating one of the mixed colors.

To get this process to work for computer communication, we need to have the process result
in a share common number to act as the common secret encryption key. For this, we need a
numerical one-way function.

Modular arithmetic
If you think back to doing division with whole numbers, you may remember finding the
whole number result and the remainder after division.

   Modulus11
   The modulus is another name for the remainder after division.
   For example, 17 mod 5 = 2, since if we divide 17 by 5, we get 3 with remainder 2.

Modular arithmetic is sometimes called clock arithmetic, since analog clocks wrap around
times past 12, meaning they work on a modulus of 12. If the hour hand of a clock currently
points to 8, then in 5 hours it will point to 1. While 8+5 = 13, the clock wraps around after
12, so all times can be thought of as modulus 12. Mathematically, 13 mod 12 = 1.

11 Sometime, instead of seeing 17 mod 5 = 2, you'll see 17  2 (mod 5). The  symbol means "congruent to"
and means that 17 and 2 are equivalent, after you consider the modulus 5.
                                                                                          Cryptography 397

Example 11
     Compute: a) 10 mod 3 b) 15 mod 5 c) 27 mod 5

     a) Since 10 divided by 3 is 3 with remainder 1, 10 mod 3 = 1
     b) Since 15 divided by 5 is 3 with no remainder, 15 mod 5 = 0
     c) 27 = 128. 128 divide by 5 is 25 with remainder 3, so 27 mod 5 = 3

Try it Now 5
Compute: a) 23 mod 7 b) 15 mod 7 c) 2034 mod 7

Recall that when we divide 17 by 5, we could represent the result as 3 remainder 2, as the
mixed number 3 2 , or as the decimal 3.4. Notice that the modulus, 2, is the same as the

                    5
numerator of the fractional part of the mixed number, and that the decimal part 0.4 is
equivalent to the fraction 2 . We can use these conversions to calculate the modulus of not-

                               5
too-huge numbers on a standard calculator.

   Modulus on a Standard Calculator
   To calculate a mod n on a standard calculator
   1) Divide a by n
   2) Subtract the whole part of the resulting quantity
   3) Multiply by n to obtain the modulus

Example 12
     Calculate 31345 mod 419

31345 / 419 = 74.8090692      Now subtract 74 to get just the decimal remainder
74.8090692 - 74 = 0.8090692   Multiply this by 419 to get the modulus
                              This tells us 0.8090692 was equivalent to 339
0.8090692 * 419 = 339
                                                                                 419

In the text above, only a portion of the decimal value was written down. In practice, you
should try to avoid writing down the intermediary steps, and instead allow your calculator to
retain as many decimal values as it can.

The one-way function

When you use a prime number p as a modulus, you can find a special number called a
generator, g, so that gn mod p will result in all the values from 1 to p - 1.
398

In the table to the right, notice that when we give values of n    n 3n   3n mod 7
from 1 to 6, we get out all values from 1 to 6. This means 3 is a  1 3    3
generator when 7 is the modulus.                                   2 9    2
                                                                          6
This gives us our one-way function. While it is easy to compute 3 27      4
the value of gn mod p when we know n, it is difficult to find the 4 81    5
                                                                   5 243  1
exponent n to obtain a specific value.
                                                                   6 729

For example, suppose we use p = 23 and g = 5. If I pick n to be
6, I can fairly easily calculate 56 mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8.

If someone else were to tell you 5n mod 23 = 7, it is much harder to find n. In this particular
case, we'd have to try 22 different values for n until we found one that worked - there is no
known easier way to find n other than brute-force guessing.

While trying 22 values would not take too long, when used in practice much larger values for
p are used, typically with well over 500 digits. Trying all possibilities would be essentially
impossible.

The key exchange
Before we can begin the key exchange process, we need a couple more important facts about
modular arithmetic.

   Modular Exponentiation Rule
    (ab mod n) = (a mod n)b mod n

Example 13
     Compute 125 mod 7 using the exponentiation rule.

     Evaluated directly: 125 = 248,832, so 125 mod 7 = 248,823 mod 7 = 3.

     Using the rule above, 125 mod 7 = (12 mod 7)5 mod 7 = 55 mod 7 = 3125 mod 7 = 3.

     You may remember a basic exponent rule from algebra: (ab)c = abc = acb = (ac)b
     For example: 642 = (43)2 = 46 = (42)3 = 163

     We can combine the modular exponentiation rule with the algebra exponent rule to define the
     modular exponent power rule.

Modular Exponent Power Rule
(ab mod n)c mod n = (abc mod n) = (ac mod n)b mod n
                                                                                          Cryptography 399

Example 14
     Verify the rule above if a = 3, b = 4, c = 5, and n = 7
     (34 mod 7)5 mod 7 = (81 mod 7)5 mod 7 = 45 mod 7 = 1024 mod 7 = 2
     (35 mod 7)4 mod 7 = (243 mod 7)4 mod 7 = 54 mod 7 = 625 mod 7 = 2, the same result.

     Try it Now 6
     Use the modular exponent rule to calculate 10000 mod 7, by noting 10000 = 104.

     This provides us the basis for our key exchange. While it will be easier to understand in the
     following example, here's the process:

         1. Alice and Bob agree publically on values a prime p and generator g.
         2. Alice picks some secret number a, while Bob picks some secret number b.
          3. Alice computes A = ga mod p and sends it to Bob.
          4. Bob computes B = gb mod p and sends it to Alice.
          5. Alice computes Ba mod p, which is (gb mod p)a mod p
         6. Bob computes Ab mod p, which is (ga mod p)b mod p

     The modular exponent power rule tells us (ga mod p)b mod p = (gb mod p)a mod p, so Alice
     and Bob will arrive at the same shared value to use as a key, even though neither knows the
     other's secret number, and no eavesdropper can determine this value knowing only g, p, A,
     and B.

Example 15
     Alice and Bob publically share a generator and prime modulus. In this case, we'll use 3 as
     the generator and 17 as the prime.

     (This example is continued on the next page)
400                               Alice                                Bob

                                  38 mod 17 = 16                 36 mod 17 = 15
 Each then secretly picks a       A = 16                         B = 15
 number n of their own.
                                  B = 15          mix in secret  A = 16
 Each calculates gn mod p         Bn mod p =         number      An mod p =
                                  158 mod 17 = 1                 166 mod 17 = 1
 They then exchange these
 resulting values.                1               shared secret 1

 Each then raises the value                       key
 they received to the power of
 their secret n mod p.

 The result is the shared secret
 key.

The shared secrets come out the same because of the modular exponent power rule
(ab mod n)c mod n = (ac mod n)b mod n. Alice computed (36 mod 17)8 mod 17 while Bob
computed (38 mod 17)6 mod 17, which the rule says will give the same results.

Notice that even if a snooper were to obtain both exchanged values A = 16 and B = 15, there
is no way they could obtain the shared secret key from these without having at least one of
Alice or Bob's secret numbers. There is no easy way to obtain the secret numbers from the
shared values, since the function was a one-way function.

Using this approach, Alice and Bob can now use the shared secret key obtained as the key for
a standard encryption algorithm like DES or AES.

     RSA
     There are several other public-key methods used, including RSA, which is very commonly
     used. RSA involves distributing a public encryption key, which anyone can use to encrypt
     messages to you, but which can only be decrypted using a separate private key. You can
     think of this as sending an open padlock to someone - they can lock up information, but no
     one can unlock it without the key you kept secret.

     RSA's security relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. For example, it's easy to
     calculate that 53 times 59 is 3127, but given the number 12,317 that is a product of two
     primes, it's much harder to find the numbers that multiply to give that number. It's
     exponentially harder when the primes each have 100 or more digits. Suppose we find two
     primes p and q and multiply them to get n = pq. This number will be very hard to factor. If
     we also know p and q, there are shortcuts to find two numbers e and d so that
     med mod n = m mod n for all numbers m. Without knowing the factorization of n, finding
     these values is very hard.

     To use RSA, we generate two primes p and q and multiply them to get n = pq. Since we
     know the factorization, we can easily find e and d so med = m mod n. Now, we lock away p,
     q, and d. We then send the values e and n out publically. To encrypt a message m, the
     sender computes S = me mod n. As we saw earlier, the modulus is a one-way function which
     makes the original message very hard to recover from S. However, we have our private key
     d we can use to decrypt the message. When we receive the secret message S, we compute

   S d mod n = (me )d mod n = med mod n = m mod n , recovering the original message12.

Example 16
     Suppose that Alice has computed n = 3127, e = 3, and d = 2011. Show how Bob would
     encrypt the message 50 and how Alice would then decrypt it.

     Bob would only know his message, m = 50 and Alice's public key: n = 3127 and e = 3. He
     would encrypt the message by computing me mod n: 503 mod 3127 = 3047.

     Alice can then decrypt this message using her private key d by computing Sd mod n:
     30472011 mod 3127 = 50.

     This method differs from Diffie-Hellman-Merkle because no exchange process is needed;
     Bob could send Alice an encrypted message using Bob's public key without having to
     communicate with Alice beforehand to determine a shared secret key. This is especially
     handy for applications like encrypting email, where both parties might not be online at the
     same time to perform a Diffie-Hellman-Merkle style key exchange.

      12 Many details have been left out, including how e and d are determined, and why this all works. For a bit
      more detail, see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXB-V_Keiu8, or http://doctrina.org/How-RSA-Works-

Other secret keeping methods
   While this chapter has focused on cryptography methods for keeping a message secure, there
   is another area of secret keeping called steganography which focuses on hiding the
   existence of a message altogether. Historically, steganography included techniques like
   invisible ink, watermarks, or embedding a secret message inside a longer document that
   appeared unimportant. The digital age has provided many new ways to hide messages in
   digital photos or in the background noise of a music file.

    encrypted using a tabular transposition cipher with the encryption keyword "READING".

16. Decrypt the message "UYH SRT ABV HLN SEE L" if it was encrypted using a tabular
    transposition cipher with the encryption keyword "MAIL".

Shifting substitution ciphers
17. Encrypt the message "SEND SUPPLIES" using an alphabetic Caesar cipher that starts

    with shift 7 (mapping A to H), and shifts one additional space after each character is
    encoded.

18. Encrypt the message "CANCEL CONTRACT" using an alphabetic Caesar cipher that
    starts with shift 5 (mapping A to F), and shifts one additional space after each character is
    encoded.

27. Suppose that Alice has computed n = 33, e = 7, and d = 3. Show how Bob would encrypt

    the message 5 and how Alice would then decrypt it.

28. Suppose that Alice has computed n = 55, e = 7, and d = 13. Show how Bob would
    encrypt the message 8 and how Alice would then decrypt it.

Extensions
29. To further obscure a message, sometimes the usual alphabet characters are replaced with

    other symbols. Design a new set of symbols, and use it to encode a message. Exchange
    with a friend and see if they can decode your message.

30. To make an encryption harder to break, sometimes multiple substitution and transposition
    ciphers are used in sequence. For example, a method might specify that the first letter of
    the encryption keyword be used to determine the initial shift for a Caesar cipher (perhaps
    with a rotating cipher), and also be used for a transposition cipher. Design your own
    sequence of encryption steps and encrypt a message. Exchange with a friend and see if
    they can follow your process to decrypt the message.

31. When using large primes, computing values like 6724 mod 83 can be difficult on a
    calculator without using additional tricks, since 6724 is a huge number. We will explore
    an approach used.
         a. Notice that 672 mod 83 is fairly easy to calculate: 672 mod 83 = 4489 mod 83 = 7.

             Since 674 mod 83 = (672)2 mod 83 can be rewritten using the modular exponent
             rule as (672 mod 83)2 mod 83, this is also easy to evaluate:
             674 mod 83 = (672 mod 83)2 mod 83 = 72 mod 83 = 49.

             This process can be continued to find 678 mod 83 as (64)2 mod 83. Find this
             value, then find 6716 mod 83 and 6732 mod 83.

         b. There is a rule that (ab) mod n = (a mod n)(b mod n) mod n
             Noting that 17000 = 170*100, calculate 17000 mod 83 using the rule above.

         c. Note that 675 = 67467. Use this, along with the rule from above and the results
             from part a to compute 675 mod 83.

         d. Note that 677 = 674+2+1 = 674 672 671. Compute 677 mod 83.

         e. Write 6724 as a product of powers of 67, and use this to compute 6724 mod 83

32. Use the process from the previous question to evaluate 2334 mod 37
406

33. To encrypt text messages with RSA, the words are first converted into a string of
    numbers, and then encrypted. Several characters are usually combined together to
    produce a message number smaller than the modulus, but approximately the same size.
    Look up an ASCII table to convert the message "SCALE THE WALLS" to numbers,
    then encrypt it using the RSA public key n = 10823, e = 5. Since ASCII characters are
    two digits, pair up characters to form four-digit numbers before encoding. For example
    A is 65 and B is 66, so the character pair AB could be treated as the number 6566 and
    encrypted as 10148

34. Explore approaches to steganography that don't require specialized software. Attempt to
    hide a message using one of these techniques, and see if a fellow student can detect the
    message.

35. When you visit a secure website, your web browser will
    report that the site's identity has been verified by a third
    party, called a certificate authority. This is meant to
    assure you that you are visiting the actual company's
    website. Research how these certificates work.

Logic

     Logic is, basically, the study of valid reasoning. When searching the internet, we use Boolean
     logic - terms like "and" and "or" - to help us find specific web pages that fit in the sets we
     are interested in. After exploring this form of logic, we will look at logical arguments and
     how we can determine the validity of a claim.

 Boolean Logic
     We can often classify items as belonging to sets. If you went the library to search for a book
     and they asked you to express your search using unions, intersections, and complements of
     sets, that would feel a little strange. Instead, we typically using words like "and", "or", and
     "not" to connect our keywords together to form a search. These words, which form the basis
     of Boolean logic, are directly related to our set operations. (Boolean logic was developed by
     the 19th-century English mathematician George Boole.)

Boolean Logic
Boolean logic combines multiple statements that are either true or false into an
expression that is either true or false.

In connection to sets, a search is true if the element is part of the set.

Suppose M is the set of all mystery books, and C is the set of all comedy books. If we search
for "mystery", we are looking for all the books that are an element of the set M; the search is
true for books that are in the set.

When we search for "mystery and comedy", we are looking for a book that is an element of
both sets, in the intersection. If we were to search for "mystery or comedy", we are looking
for a book that is a mystery, a comedy, or both, which is the union of the sets. If we searched
for "not comedy", we are looking for any book in the library that is not a comedy, the
complement of the set C.

Connection to Set Operations

A and B elements in the intersection A  B

A or B  elements in the union A  B
not A   elements in the complement Ac

Notice here that or is not exclusive. This is a difference between the Boolean logic use of the
word and common everyday use. When your significant other asks "do you want to go to the
park or the movies?" they usually are proposing an exclusive choice - one option or the
other, but not both. In Boolean logic, the or is not exclusive - more like being asked at a
restaurant "would you like fries or a drink with that?" Answering "both, please" is an
acceptable answer.

Example 1
     Suppose we are searching a library database for Mexican universities. Express a reasonable
     search using Boolean logic.

     We could start with the search "Mexico and university", but would be likely to find results
     for the U.S. state New Mexico. To account for this, we could revise our search to read:
     Mexico and university not "New Mexico"

     In most internet search engines, it is not necessary to include the word and; the search engine
     assumes that if you provide two keywords you are looking for both. In Google's search, the
     keyword or has be capitalized as OR, and a negative sign in front of a word is used to
     indicate not. Quotes around a phrase indicate that the entire phrase should be looked for. The
     search from the previous example on Google could be written:
     Mexico university -"New Mexico"

Example 2
     Describe the numbers that meet the condition:
              even and less than 10 and greater than 0

     The numbers that satisfy all three requirements are {2, 4, 6, 8}

     Sometimes statements made in English can be ambiguous. For this reason, Boolean logic
     uses parentheses to show precedent, just like in algebraic order of operations.

Example 3
     Describe the numbers that meet the condition:
              odd number and less than 20 and greater than 0 and (multiple of 3 or multiple of 5)

     The first three conditions limit us to the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19}

     The last grouped conditions tell us to find elements of this set that are also either a multiple
     of 3 or a multiple of 5. This leaves us with the set {3, 5, 9, 15}

     Notice that we would have gotten a very different result if we had written
              (odd number and less than 20 and greater than 0 and multiple of 3) or multiple of 5

     The first grouped set of conditions would give {3, 9, 15}. When combined with the last
     condition, though, this set expands without limits:
     {3, 5, 9, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, ...}
                                                                                                         Logic 409

Example 4
     The English phrase "Go to the store and buy me eggs and bagels or cereal" is ambiguous; it
     is not clear whether the requestors is asking for eggs always along with either bagels or
     cereal, or whether they're asking for either the combination of eggs and bagels, or just cereal.

     For this reason, using parentheses clarifies the intent:
     Eggs and (bagels or cereal) means Option 1: Eggs and bagels, Option 2: Eggs and cereal
     (Eggs and bagels) or cereal means Option 1: Eggs and bagels, Option 2: Cereal

     Be aware that when a string of conditions is written without grouping symbols, it is often
     interpreted from the left to right, resulting in the latter interpretation.

 Conditional Statements
     Beyond searching, Boolean logic is commonly used in spreadsheet applications like Excel to
     do conditional calculations. A statement is something that is either true or false. A statement
     like 3 < 5 is true; a statement like "a rat is a fish" is false. A statement like "x < 5" is true for
     some values of x and false for others. When an action is taken or not depending on the value
     of a statement, it forms a conditional.

         Statements and Conditionals
         A statement is either true or false.
         A conditional is a compound statement of the form

              "if p then q" or "if p then q, else s".

Example 5
     In common language, an example of a conditional statement would be "If it is raining, then
     we'll go to the mall. Otherwise we'll go for a hike."

     The statement "If it is raining" is the condition - this may be true or false for any given day.
     If the condition is true, then we will follow the first course of action, and go to the mall. If
     the condition is false, then we will use the alternative, and go for a hike.

Example 6
     As mentioned earlier, conditional statements are commonly used in spreadsheet applications
     like Excel or Google Sheets. In Excel, you can enter an expression like
      =IF(A1<2000, A1+1, A1*2)

     Notice that after the IF, there are three parts. The first part is the condition, and the second
     two are calculations. Excel will look at the value in cell A1 and compare it to 2000. If that
     condition is true, then the first calculation is used, and 1 is added to the value of A1 and the
     result is stored. If the condition is false, then the second calculation is used, and A1 is
     multiplied by 2 and the result is stored.
     410

     In other words, this statement is equivalent to saying "If the value of A1 is less than 2000,
     then add 1 to the value in A1. Otherwise, multiply A1 by 2".

Example 7
     The expression =IF(A1>5, 2*A1, 3*A1) is used. Find the result if A1 is 3, and the result if
     A1 is 8.

     This is equivalent to saying
     If A1 > 5, then calculate 2*A1. Otherwise, calculate 3*A1

     If A1 is 3, then the condition is false, since 3 > 5 is not true, so we do the alternate action,
     and multiply by 3, giving 3*3 = 9

     If A1 is 8, then the condition is true, since 8 > 5, so we multiply the value by 2, giving
     2*8=16

Example 8
     An accountant needs to withhold 15% of income for taxes if the income is below $30,000,
     and 20% of income if the income is $30,000 or more. Write an expression that would
     calculate the amount to withhold.

     Our conditional needs to compare the value to 30,000. If the income is less than 30,000, we
     need to calculate 15% of the income: 0.15*income. If the income is more than 30,000, we
     need to calculate 20% of the income: 0.20*income.

     In words we could write "If income < 30,000, then multiply by 0.15, otherwise multiply by
     0.20". In Excel, we would write:

     =IF(A1<30000, 0.15*A1, 0.20*A1)

     As we did earlier, we can create more complex conditions by using the operators and, or, and
     not to join simpler conditions together.

Example 9
     A parent might say to their child "if you clean your room and take out the garbage, then you
     can have ice cream."

     Here, there are two simpler conditions:
     1) The child cleaning her room
     2) The child taking out the garbage
                                                                                                         Logic 411

     Since these conditions were joined with and, the combined conditional will be true only if
     both simpler conditions are true; if either chore is not completed, then the parent's condition
     is not met.

     Notice that if the parent had said "if you clean your room or take out the garbage, then you
     can have ice cream", then the child would need to complete only one chore to meet the
     condition.

     Suppose you wanted to have something happen when a certain value is between 100 and 300.
     To create the condition "A1 < 300 and A1 > 100" in Excel, you would need to enter
     "AND(A1<300, A1>100)". Likewise, for the condition "A1=4 or A1=6" you would enter
     "OR(A1=4, A1=6)"

Example 10
     In a spreadsheet, cell A1 contains annual income, and A2 contains number of dependents.
     A certain tax credit applies if someone with no dependents earns less than $10,000, or if
     someone with dependents earns less than $20,000. Write a rule that describes this.

     There are two ways the rule is met:
     income is less than 10,000 and dependents is 0, or
     income is less than 20,000 and dependents is not 0.

     Informally, we could write these as
     (A1 < 10000 and A2 = 0) or (A1 < 20000 and A2 > 0)

     In Excel's format, we'd write
     IF(OR(AND(A1<10000, A2=0), AND(A1<20000, A2>0)), "you qualify", "you don't
     qualify")

 Quantified Statements
     Words that describe an entire set, such as "all", "every", or "none", are called universal
     quantifiers because that set could be considered a universal set. In contrast, words or phrases
     such as "some", "one", or "at least one" are called existential quantifiers because they
     describe the existence of at least one element in a set.

         Quantifiers
         A universal quantifier states that an entire set of things share a characteristic.

         An existential quantifier states that a set contains at least one element.

     Something interesting happens when we negate - or state the opposite of - a quantified
     statement.
     412

Example 11
     Suppose your friend says "Everybody cheats on their taxes." What is the minimum amount
     of evidence you would need to prove your friend wrong?

     To show that it is not true that everybody cheats on their taxes, all you need is one person
     who does not cheat on their taxes. It would be perfectly fine to produce more people who do
     not cheat, but one counterexample is all you need.

     It is important to note that you do not need to show that absolutely nobody cheats on their
     taxes.

Example 12
     Suppose your friend says "One of these six cartons of milk is leaking." What is the minimum
     amount of evidence you would need to prove your friend wrong?

     In this case, you would need to check all six cartons and show that none of them is leaking.
     You cannot disprove your friend's statement by checking only one of the cartons.

     When we negate a statement with a universal quantifier, we get a statement with an
     existential quantifier, and vice-versa.

         Negating a quantified statement
         The negation of "all A are B" is "at least one A is not B".
         The negation of "no A are B" is "at least one A is B".
         The negation of "at least one A is B" is "no A are B".
         The negation of "at least one A is not B" is "all A are B".

Example 13
     "Somebody brought a flashlight." Write the negation of this statement.

     The negation is "Nobody brought a flashlight."

Example 14
     "There are no prime numbers that are even." Write the negation of this statement.

     The negation is "At least one prime number is even."

Truth Tables: Conjunction (and), Disjunction (or), Negation (not)
   Before we focus on truth tables, we're going to introduce some symbols that are commonly
   used for and, or, and not.

Symbols                        A and B is notated A  B
The symbol  is used for and:   A or B is notated A  B
The symbol  is used for or:    not A is notated ~A
The symbol ~ is used for not:

You can remember the first two symbols by relating them to the shapes for the union and
intersection. A  B would be the elements that exist in both sets, in A  B. Likewise, A  B
would be the elements that exist in either set, in A  B. When we are working with sets, we
use the rounded version of the symbols; when we are working with statements, we use the
pointy version.

Example 15
     Translate each statement into symbolic notation. Let P represent "I like Pepsi" and let C
     represent "I like Coke".

a. I like Pepsi or I like Coke.
b. I like Pepsi and I like Coke.
c. I do not like Pepsi.
d. It is not the case that I like Pepsi or Coke.
e. I like Pepsi and I do not like Coke.

a. P  C

b. P  C
c. ~P

d. ~(P  C)

e. P  ~C
As you can see, we can use parentheses to organize more complicated statements.

Translate "We have carrots or we will not make soup" into symbols. Let C represent "we
have carrots" and let S represent "we will make soup".
414

Because complex Boolean statements can get tricky to think about, we can create a truth
table to keep track of what truth values for the simple statements make the complex
statement true and false.

   Truth table
   A table showing what the resulting truth value of a complex statement is for all the
   possible truth values for the simple statements.

Example 16
     Suppose you're picking out a new couch, and your significant other says "get a sectional or
     something with a chaise".

This is a complex statement made of two simpler conditions: "is a sectional", and "has a
chaise". For simplicity, let's use S to designate "is a sectional", and C to designate "has a
chaise".
A truth table for this situation would look like this:

S  C                S or C

T  T                T

T  F                T

F  T                T

F  F                F

In the table, T is used for true, and F for false. In the first row, if S is true and C is also true,
then the complex statement "S or C" is true. This would be a sectional that also has a chaise,
which meets our desire. (Remember that or in logic is not exclusive; if the couch has both
features, it meets the condition.)

In the previous example about the couch, the truth table was really just summarizing what we
already know about how the or statement work. The truth tables for the basic and, or, and not
statements are shown below.

Basic truth tables   Disjunction  Negation
      Conjunction
                    A B AB        A ~A
      A B AB        TT T          T F
      TT T          TF T          F T
      TF F          FT T
      FT F          FF F
      FF F

Truth tables really become useful when we analyze more complex Boolean statements.
                                                                                                         Logic 415

Example 17
     Create a truth table for the statement A  ~B

     When we create the truth table, we need to list all the possible truth value combinations for A
     and B. Notice how the first column contains 2 Ts followed by 2 Fs, and the second column
     alternates T, F, T, F. This pattern ensures that all 4 combinations are considered.

             A B
             T T
             T F
             F T
             F F

     After creating columns with those initial values, we create a third column for the expression
     ~B. Now we will temporarily ignore the column for A and write the truth values for ~B.

             A B ~B
             TT F
             TF T
             FT F
             FF T

     Next we can find the truth values of A  ~B, using the first and third columns.
             A B ~B A  ~B
             TT F T
             TF T T
             FT F F
             FF T T

     The truth table shows that A  ~B is true in three cases and false in one case. If you're
     wondering what the point of this is, suppose it is the last day of the baseball season and two
     teams, who are not playing each other, are competing for the final playoff spot. Anaheim will
     make the playoffs if it wins its game or if Boston does not win its game. (Anaheim owns the
     tie-breaker; if both teams win, or if both teams lose, then Anaheim gets the playoff spot.) If A
     = Anaheim wins its game and B = Boston wins its game, then A  ~B represents the situation
     "Anaheim wins its game or Boston does not win its game". The truth table shows us the
     different scenarios related to Anaheim making the playoffs. In the first row, Anaheim wins
     its game and Boston wins its game, so it is true that Anaheim makes the playoffs. In the
     second row, Anaheim wins and Boston does not win, so it is true that Anaheim makes the
     playoffs. In the third row, Anaheim does not win its game and Boston wins its game, so it is
     false that Anaheim makes the playoffs. In the fourth row, Anaheim does not win and Boston

Example 18
     Create a truth table for the statement A  ~(B  C)

It helps to work from the inside out when creating a truth table, and to create columns in the
table for intermediate operations. We start by listing all the possible truth value combinations
for A, B, and C. Notice how the first column contains 4 Ts followed by 4 Fs, the second
column contains 2 Ts, 2 Fs, then repeats, and the last column alternates T, F, T, F... This
pattern ensures that all 8 combinations are considered. After creating columns with those
initial values, we create a fourth column for the innermost expression, B  C. Now we will
temporarily ignore the column for A and focus on B and C, writing the truth values for B  C.

     A B C                                              A B C BC
     T T T                                              TTT T
     T T F                                              TTF T
     T F T                                              TFT T
     T F F                                              TFF F
     F T T                                              FTT T
     F T F                                              FTF T

     F F F                                              FFF F

Next we can find the negation of B  C, working off the B  C column we just created.
(Ignore the first three columns and simply negate the values in the B  C column.)

Finally, we find the values of A and ~(B  C). (Ignore the second, third, and fourth columns.)

     It turns out that this complex expression is true in only one case: when A is true, B is false,
     and C is false. To illustrate this situation, suppose that Anaheim will make the playoffs if: (1)
     Anaheim wins, and (2) neither Boston nor Cleveland wins. TFF is the only scenario in which
     Anaheim will make the playoffs.

 Truth Tables: Conditional, Biconditional
     We discussed conditional statements earlier, in which we take an action based on the value of
     the condition. We are now going to look at another version of a conditional, sometimes
     called an implication, which states that the second part must logically follow from the first.

         Conditional
         A conditional is a logical compound statement in which a statement p, called the
         antecedent, implies a statement q, called the consequent.

         A conditional is written as p  q and is translated as "if p, then q".

Example 19
     The English statement "If it is raining, then there are clouds is the sky" is a conditional
     statement. It makes sense because if the antecedent "it is raining" is true, then the consequent
     "there are clouds in the sky" must also be true.

     Notice that the statement tells us nothing of what to expect if it is not raining; there might be
     clouds in the sky, or there might not. If the antecedent is false, then the consquent becomes
     irrelevant.

Example 20
     Suppose you order a team jersey online on Tuesday and want to receive it by Friday so you
     can wear it to Saturday's game. The website says that if you pay for expedited shipping, you
     will receive the jersey by Friday. In what situation is the website telling a lie?

     There are four possible outcomes:
     1) You pay for expedited shipping and receive the jersey by Friday
     2) You pay for expedited shipping and don't receive the jersey by Friday
     3) You don't pay for expedited shipping and receive the jersey by Friday
     4) You don't pay for expedited shipping and don't receive the jersey by Friday
     418

     Only one of these outcomes proves that the website was lying: the second outcome in which
     you pay for expedited shipping but don't receive the jersey by Friday. The first outcome is
     exactly what was promised, so there's no problem with that. The third outcome is not a lie
     because the website never said what would happen if you didn't pay for expedited shipping;
     maybe the jersey would arrive by Friday whether you paid for expedited shipping or not. The
     fourth outcome is not a lie because, again, the website didn't make any promises about when
     the jersey would arrive if you didn't pay for expedited shipping.

     It may seem strange that the third outcome in the previous example, in which the first part is
     false but the second part is true, is not a lie. Remember, though, that if the antecedent is false,
     we cannot make any judgment about the consequent. The website never said that paying for
     expedited shipping was the only way to receive the jersey by Friday.

Example 21
     A friend tells you "If you upload that picture to Facebook, you'll lose your job." Under what
     conditions can you say that your friend was wrong?

     There are four possible outcomes:
     1) You upload the picture and lose your job
     2) You upload the picture and don't lose your job
     3) You don't upload the picture and lose your job
     4) You don't upload the picture and don't lose your job

     There is only one possible case in which you can say your friend was wrong: the second
     outcome in which you upload the picture but still keep your job. In the last two cases, your
     friend didn't say anything about what would happen if you didn't upload the picture, so you
     can't say that their statement was wrong. Even if you didn't upload the picture and lost your
     job anyway, your friend never said that you were guaranteed to keep your job if you didn't
     upload the picture; you might lose your job for missing a shift or punching your boss instead.

     In traditional logic, a conditional is considered true as long as there are no cases in which the
     antecedent is true and the consequent is false.

         Truth table for the conditional
               p q pq
               TT T
               TF F
               FT T
               FF T

     Again, if the antecedent p is false, we cannot prove that the statement is a lie, so the result of
     the third and fourth rows is true.
                                                                  Logic 419

Example 22
     Construct a truth table for the statement (m  ~p)  r

We start by constructing a truth table with 8 rows to cover all possible scenarios. Next, we
can focus on the antecedent, m  ~p.

mp r      m p r ~p                                         m p r ~p m  ~p
T T T     TTT F

F T T     FTT F
F T F     FTF F                                            TFT T  T
F F T     FFT T
F F F     FFF T                                            TFF T  T

                                                           FTT F  F

                                                           FTF F  F

                                                           FFT T  F

                                                           FFF T  F

Now we can create a column for the conditional. Because it can be confusing to keep track of
all the Ts and Fs, why don't we copy the column for r to the right of the column for m  ~p ?
This makes it a lot easier to read the conditional from left to right.

m p r ~p m  ~p r (m  ~p)  r

TTT F  F  T  T

TTF F  F  F  T

TFT T  T  T  T

TFF T  T  F  F

FTT F  F  T  T

FTF F  F  F  T

FFT T  F  T  T

FFF T  F  F  T

When m is true, p is false, and r is false--the fourth row of the table--then the antecedent m
 ~p will be true but the consequent false, resulting in an invalid conditional; every other
case gives a valid conditional.

If you want a real-life situation that could be modeled by (m  ~p)  r, consider this: let m =
we order meatballs, p = we order pasta, and r = Rob is happy. The statement (m  ~p)  r is
"if we order meatballs and don't order pasta, then Rob is happy". If m is true (we order
meatballs), p is false (we don't order pasta), and r is false (Rob is not happy), then the
statement is false, because we satisfied the antecedent but Rob did not satisfy the consequent.

For any conditional, there are three related statements, the converse, the inverse, and the
contrapositive.

Related Statements           "if p, then q"           p  q
The original conditional is  "if q, then p"           q  p
The converse is              "if not p, then not q"  ~p  ~q
The inverse is               "if not q, then not p"  ~q  ~p
The contrapositive is

Example 23
     Consider again the conditional "If it is raining, then there are clouds in the sky." It seems
     reasonable to assume that this is true.

     The converse would be "If there are clouds in the sky, then it is raining." This is not always
     true.

     The inverse would be "If it is not raining, then there are not clouds in the sky." Likewise, this
     is not always true.

     The contrapositive would be "If there are not clouds in the sky, then it is not raining." This
     statement is true, and is equivalent to the original conditional.

Looking at truth tables, we can see that the original conditional and the contrapositive are
logically equivalent, and that the converse and inverse are logically equivalent.

     p q  Conditional        Converse  Inverse  Contrapositive
     T T     p  q             q  p     ~p  ~q      ~q  ~p

                                           T

                                        Equivalent

Equivalence
A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.
The converse and inverse of a conditional statement are logically equivalent.

In other words, the original statement and the contrapositive must agree with each other; they
must both be true, or they must both be false. Similarly, the converse and the inverse must
agree with each other; they must both be true, or they must both be false.
                                                                                                         Logic 421

     Be aware that symbolic logic cannot represent the English language perfectly. For example,
     we may need to change the verb tense to show that one thing occurred before another.

Example 24
     Suppose this statement is true: "If I eat this giant cookie, then I will feel sick." Which of the
     following statements must also be true?

     a. If I feel sick, then I ate that giant cookie.
     b. If I don't eat this giant cookie, then I won't feel sick.
     c. If I don't feel sick, then I didn't eat that giant cookie.

     a. This is the converse, which is not necessarily true. I could feel sick for some other reason,
     such as drinking sour milk.

     b. This is the inverse, which is not necessarily true. Again, I could feel sick for some other
     reason; avoiding the cookie doesn't guarantee that I won't feel sick.

     c. This is the contrapositive, which is true, but we have to think somewhat backwards to
     explain it. If I ate the cookie, I would feel sick, but since I don't feel sick, I must not have
     eaten the cookie.

     Notice again that the original statement and the contrapositive have the same truth value
     (both are true), and the converse and the inverse have the same truth value (both are false).

     Try it Now 5
     "If you microwave salmon in the staff kitchen, then I will be mad at you." If this statement is
     true, which of the following statements must also be true?
     a. If you don't microwave salmon in the staff kitchen, then I won't be mad at you.
     b. If I am not mad at you, then you didn't microwave salmon in the staff kitchen.
     c. If I am mad at you, then you microwaved salmon in the staff kitchen.

     Consider the statement "If you park here, then you will get a ticket." What set of conditions
     would prove this statement false?

     a. You don't park here and you get a ticket.
     b. You don't park here and you don't get a ticket.
     c. You park here and you don't get a ticket.

     The first two statements are irrelevant because we don't know what will happen if you park
     somewhere else. The third statement, however contradicts the conditional statement "If you
     park here, then you will get a ticket" because you parked here but didn't get a ticket. This
     example demonstrates a general rule; the negation of a conditional can be written as a
     conjunction: "It is not the case that if you park here, then you will get a ticket" is equivalent
     to "You park here and you do not get a ticket."
     422

         The Negation of a Conditional
         The negation of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to a conjunction of the
         antecedent and the negation of the consequent.

                                          ~(p  q) is equivalent to p  ~q

Example 25
     Which of the following statements is equivalent to the negation of "If you don't grease the
     pan, then the food will stick to it" ?

     a. I didn't grease the pan and the food didn't stick to it.
     b. I didn't grease the pan and the food stuck to it.
     c. I greased the pan and the food didn't stick to it.

     a. This is correct; it is the conjunction of the antecedent and the negation of the consequent.
     To disprove that not greasing the pan will cause the food to stick, I have to not grease the pan
     and have the food not stick.

     b. This is essentially the original statement with no negation; the "if...then" has been
     replaced by "and".

     c. This essentially agrees with the original statement and cannot disprove it.

     Try it Now 6
     "If you go swimming less than an hour after eating lunch, then you will get cramps." Which
     of the following statements is equivalent to the negation of this statement?
     a. I went swimming more than an hour after eating lunch and I got cramps.
     b. I went swimming less than an hour after eating lunch and I didn't get cramps.
     c. I went swimming more than an hour after eating lunch and I didn't get cramps.

     In everyday life, we often have a stronger meaning in mind when we use a conditional
     statement. Consider "If you submit your hours today, then you will be paid next Friday."
     What the payroll rep really means is "If you submit your hours today, then you will be paid
     next Friday, and if you don't submit your hours today, then you won't be paid next Friday."
     The conditional statement if t, then p also includes the inverse of the statement: if not t, then
     not p. A more compact way to express this statement is "You will be paid next Friday if and
     only if you submit your timesheet today." A statement of this form is called a biconditional.

         Biconditional
         A biconditional is a logical conditional statement in which the antecedent and
         consequent are interchangeable.

         A biconditional is written as p  q and is translated as "p if and only if q".
                                                                                                         Logic 423

     Because a biconditional statement p  q is equivalent to (p  q)  (q  p), we may think
     of it as a conditional statement combined with its converse: if p, then q and if q, then p. The
     double-headed arrow shows that the conditional statement goes from left to right and from
     right to left. A biconditional is considered true as long as the antecedent and the consequent
     have the same truth value; that is, they are either both true or both false.

         Truth table for the biconditional
               p q pq

               FT F
               FF T

     Notice that the fourth row, where both components are false, is true; if you don't submit your
     timesheet and you don't get paid, the person from payroll told you the truth.

Example 26
     Suppose this statement is true: "The garbage truck comes down my street if and only if it is
     Thursday morning." Which of the following statements could be true?

     a. It is noon on Thursday and the garbage truck did not come down my street this morning.
     b. It is Monday and the garbage truck is coming down my street.
     c. It is Wednesday at 11:59PM and the garbage truck did not come down my street today.

     a. This cannot be true. This is like the second row of the truth table; it is true that I just
     experienced Thursday morning, but it is false that the garbage truck came.

     b. This cannot be true. This is like the third row of the truth table; it is false that it is
     Thursday, but it is true that the garbage truck came.

     c. This could be true. This is like the fourth row of the truth table; it is false that it is
     Thursday, but it is also false that the garbage truck came, so everything worked out like it
     should.

Example 27
     Create a truth table for the statement (A  B)  ~C

Whenever we have three component statements, we start by listing all the possible truth
value combinations for A, B, and C. After creating those three columns, we can create a
fourth column for the antecedent, A  B. Now we will temporarily ignore the column for C
and focus on A and B, writing the truth values for A  B.

     A B C                                              A B C AB

     T F F                                              TFF T
     F T T                                              FTT T

     F F F                                              FFF F

Next we can create a column for the negation of C. (Ignore the A  B column and simply
negate the values in the C column.)

        A B C A  B ~C
        TTT T F
        TTF T T
        TFT T F
        TFF T T
        FTT T F
        FTF T T
        FFT F F
        FFF F T

Finally, we find the truth values of (A  B)  ~C. Remember, a biconditional is true when
the truth value of the two parts match, but it is false when the truth values do not match.

     A B C A  B ~C (A  B)  ~C

     TTT T F  F

     TTF T T  T

     TFT T F  F

     TFF T T  T

     FTT T F  F

     FTF T T  T

     FFT F F  T

     FFF F T  F

To illustrate this situation, suppose your boss needs you to do either project A or project B (or
both, if you have the time). If you do one of the projects, you will not get a crummy review
(C is for crummy). So (A  B)  ~C means "You will not get a crummy review if and only
if you do project A or project B." Looking at a few of the rows of the truth table, we can see
                                                                                                         Logic 425

     how this works out. In the first row, A, B, and C are all true: you did both projects and got a
     crummy review, which is not what your boss told you would happen! That is why the final
     result of the first row is false. In the fourth row, A is true, B is false, and C is false: you did
     project A and did not get a crummy review. This is what your boss said would happen, so the
     final result of this row is true. And in the eighth row, A, B, and C are all false: you didn't do
     either project and did not get a crummy review. This is not what your boss said would
     happen, so the final result of this row is false. (Even though you may be happy that your boss
     didn't follow through on the threat, the truth table shows that your boss lied about what
     would happen.)

 De Morgan's Laws
     A contemporary of Boole's, Augustus De Morgan, formalized two rules of logic that had
     previously been known informally. They allow us to rewrite the negation of a conjunction as
     a disjunction, and vice-versa.

     For example, suppose you want to schedule a meeting with two colleagues at 4:30PM on
     Friday, and you need both of them to be available at that time. What situation would make it
     impossible to have the meeting? It is NOT the case that colleague a is available AND
     colleague b is available: ~(a  b). This situation is equivalent to either colleague a NOT
     being available OR colleague b NOT being available: ~a  ~b.

         De Morgan's Laws
         The negation of a conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of the negation of the
         statements making up the conjunction. To negate an "and" statement, negate each part
         and change the "and" to "or".

                                          ~(p  q) is equivalent to ~p  ~q
         The negation of a disjunction is equivalent to the conjunction of the negation of the
         statements making up the disjunction. To negate an "or" statement, negate each part
         and change the "or" to "and".

                                          ~(p  q) is equivalent to ~p  ~q

Example 28
     For Valentine's Day, you did not get your sweetie flowers or candy: Which of the following
     statements is logically equivalent?

     a. You did not get them flowers or did not get them candy.
     b. You did not get them flowers and did not get them candy.
     c. You got them flowers or got them candy.

     a. This statement does not go far enough; it leaves open the possibility that you got them one
     of the two things.
     b. This statement is equivalent to the original; ~(f  c) is equivalent to ~f  ~c.
     c. This statement says that you got them something, but we know that you did not.

 Arguments
     A logical argument is a claim that a set of premises support a conclusion. There are two
     general types of arguments: inductive and deductive arguments.

         Argument types
         An inductive argument uses a collection of specific examples as its premises and uses
         them to propose a general conclusion.

         A deductive argument uses a collection of general statements as its premises and uses
         them to propose a specific situation as the conclusion.

Example 29
     The argument "when I went to the store last week I forgot my purse, and when I went today I
     forgot my purse. I always forget my purse when I go the store" is an inductive argument.

     The premises are:
     I forgot my purse last week
     I forgot my purse today

     The conclusion is:
     I always forget my purse

     Notice that the premises are specific situations, while the conclusion is a general statement.
     In this case, this is a fairly weak argument, since it is based on only two instances.

Example 30
     The argument "every day for the past year, a plane flies over my house at 2:00 P.M. A plane
     will fly over my house every day at 2:00 P.M." is a stronger inductive argument, since it is
     based on a larger set of evidence. While it is not necessarily true--the airline may have
     cancelled its afternoon flight--it is probably a safe bet.
                                                                                                Logic 427

Evaluating inductive arguments
An inductive argument is never able to prove the conclusion true, but it can provide
either weak or strong evidence to suggest that it may be true.

Many scientific theories, such as the big bang theory, can never be proven. Instead, they are
inductive arguments supported by a wide variety of evidence. Usually in science, an idea is
considered a hypothesis until it has been well tested, at which point it graduates to being
considered a theory. Common scientific theories, like Newton's theory of gravity, have all
stood up to years of testing and evidence, though sometimes they need to be adjusted based
on new evidence, such as when Einstein proposed the theory of general relativity.

A deductive argument is more clearly valid or not, which makes it easier to evaluate.

   Evaluating deductive arguments
   A deductive argument is considered valid if, assuming that all the premises are true, the
   conclusion follows logically from those premises. In other words, when the premises
   are all true, the conclusion must be true.

Evaluating Deductive Arguments with Euler Diagrams

We can interpret a deductive argument visually with an Euler diagram, which is essentially
the same thing as a Venn diagram. This can make it easier to determine whether the
argument is valid or invalid.

Example 31
     Consider the deductive argument "All cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat, so a tiger is a
     mammal." Is this argument valid?

The premises are:
All cats are mammals.
A tiger is a cat.

The conclusion is:                                               Mammals
A tiger is a mammal.

Both the premises are true. To see that the premises must        Cats
logically lead to the conclusion, we can use a Venn
diagram. From the first premise, we draw the set of cats as a    Tiger
subset of the set of mammals. From the second premise, we          x
are told that a tiger is contained within the set of cats. From
that, we can see in the Venn diagram that the tiger must also
be inside the set of mammals, so the conclusion is valid.
428

   Analyzing arguments with Euler diagrams
   To analyze an argument with an Euler diagram:
   1) Draw an Euler diagram based on the premises of the argument
   2) The argument is invalid if there is a way to draw the diagram that makes the

      conclusion false
   3) The argument is valid if the diagram cannot be drawn to make the conclusion false
   4) If the premises are insufficient to determine the location of an element or a set

      mentioned in the conclusion, then the argument is invalid.

Example 32        All firefighters know CPR.
                  Jill knows CPR.
     Premise:     Jill is a firefighter.
     Premise:
     Conclusion:

From the first premise, we know that firefighters all lie          Know CPR
inside the set of those who know CPR. (Firefighters are a          Jill x?
subset of people who know CPR.) From the second premise,
we know that Jill is a member of that larger set, but we do             x?
not have enough information to know whether she also is a
member of the smaller subset that is firefighters.                 Firefighters

Since the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the
premises, this is an invalid argument. It's possible that Jill is
a firefighter, but the structure of the argument doesn't allow
us to conclude that she definitely is.

It is important to note that whether or not Jill is actually a firefighter is not important in
evaluating the validity of the argument; we are concerned with whether the premises are
enough to prove the conclusion.

From the first premise, we know that the set of people who
live in Seattle is inside the set of those who live in
Washington. From the second premise, we know that
Marcus does not lie in the Seattle set, but we have
insufficient information to know whether Marcus lives in
Washington or not. This is an invalid argument.

Evaluating Deductive Arguments with Truth Tables

Arguments can also be analyzed using truth tables, although this can be a lot of work.

   Analyzing arguments using truth tables
   To analyze an argument with a truth table:
   1. Represent each of the premises symbolically
   2. Create a conditional statement, joining all the premises to form the antecedent, and

        using the conclusion as the consequent.
   3. Create a truth table for the statement. If it is always true, then the argument is valid.
430

Example 34

Consider the argument

Premise:       If you bought bread, then you went to the store.

Premise:       You bought bread.

Conclusion: You went to the store.

While this example is fairly obviously a valid argument, we can analyze it using a truth table
by representing each of the premises symbolically. We can then form a conditional statement
showing that the premises together imply the conclusion. If the truth table is a tautology
(always true), then the argument is valid.

We'll let b represent "you bought bread" and s represent "you went to the store". Then the

argument becomes:

Premise:       b  s

Premise:       b

Conclusion: s

To test the validity, we look at whether the combination of both premises implies the
conclusion; is it true that [(b  s)  b]  s ?

     b s bs                         b s b  s (b  s)  b
     TT T
     TF F                           TT T              T

     FF T                           TF F              F

                                    FT T              F

                                    FF T              F

     TT T                     T               T
                                              T

     FT T                     F

     FF T                     F

Since the truth table for [(b  s)  b]  s is always true, this is a valid argument.

The premises and conclusion can be stated as:

Premise:          m  j

F FF T T                              T          T                 T

From the final column of the truth table, we can see this is a valid argument.

Forms of Valid Arguments

Rather than making a truth table for every argument, we may be able to recognize certain
common forms of arguments that are valid (or invalid). If we can determine that an argument
fits one of the common forms, we can immediately state whether it is valid or invalid.

The Law of Detachment (Modus Ponens)

The law of detachment applies when a conditional and its antecedent are given as

premises, and the consequent is the conclusion. The general form is:

Premise:                p  q

Premise:                p

Conclusion:             q

The Latin name, modus ponens, translates to "mode that affirms".

Example 36

Recall this argument from an earlier example:

Premise:          If you bought bread, then you went to the store.

Premise:          You bought bread.

Conclusion: You went to the store.
432

In symbolic form:

Premise:          b  s

Premise:          b

Conclusion: s

This argument has the structure described by the law of detachment. (The second premise
and the conclusion are simply the two parts of the first premise detached from each other.)
Instead of making a truth table, we can say that this argument is valid by stating that it
satisfies the law of detachment.

The Law of Contraposition (Modus Tollens)

The law of contraposition applies when a conditional and the negation of its

consequent are given as premises, and the negation of its antecedent is the conclusion.

The general form is:

Premise:                p  q

Premise:                ~q

Conclusion:             ~p

The Latin name, modus tollens, translates to "mode that denies".

Notice that the second premise and the conclusion look like the contrapositive of the first
premise, ~q  ~p, but they have been detached. You can think of the law of contraposition
as a combination of the law of detachment and the fact that the contrapositive is logically
equivalent to the original statement.

Example 37        If I drop my phone into the swimming pool, my phone will be ruined.
                  My phone isn't ruined.
     Premise:     I didn't drop my phone into the swimming pool.
     Premise:
     Conclusion:

If we let d = I drop the phone in the pool and r = the phone is ruined, then we can represent

the argument this way:

Premise           d  r

Premise           ~r

Conclusion: ~d

The form of this argument matches what we need to invoke the law of contraposition, so it is
a valid argument.

The Transitive Property (Hypothetical Syllogism)

The transitive property has as its premises a series of conditionals, where the

consequent of one is the antecedent of the next. The conclusion is a conditional with

the same antecedent as the first premise and the same consequent as the final premise.

The general form is:

Premise:                p  q

Premise:                q  r

Conclusion:             p  r

The earlier example about buying a shirt at the mall is an example illustrating the transitive
property. It describes a chain reaction: if the first thing happens, then the second thing
happens, and if the second thing happens, then the third thing happens. Therefore, if we want
to ignore the second thing, we can say that if the first thing happens, then we know the third
thing will happen. We don't have to mention the part about buying jeans; we can simply say
that the first event leads to the final event. We could even have more than two premises; as
long as they form a chain reaction, the transitive property will give us a valid argument.

Example 38        If a soccer player commits a reckless foul, she will receive a yellow card.
                  If Hayley receives a yellow card, she will be suspended for the next match.
     Premise:     If Hayley commits a reckless foul, she will be suspended for the next match.
     Premise:
     Conclusion:

If we let r = committing a reckless foul, y = receiving a yellow card, and s = being

suspended, then our argument looks like this:

Premise           r  y

Premise           y  s

Conclusion: r  s

This argument has the exact structure required to use the transitive property, so it is a valid
argument.

Conclusion: If the old lady swallows a fly, she will die, of course.
434

     Disjunctive Syllogism

     In a disjunctive syllogism, the premises consist of an or statement and the negation of

     one of the options. The conclusion is the other option. The general form is:

     Premise:           p  q

     Premise:           ~p

     Conclusion:        q

The order of the two parts of the disjunction isn't important. In other words, we could have
the premises p  q and ~q, and the conclusion p.

Example 39        I can either drive or take the train.
                  I refuse to drive.
     Premise:     I will take the train.
     Premise:
     Conclusion:

If we let d = I drive and t = I take the train, then the symbolic representation of the argument

is:

Premise           d  t

Premise           ~d

Conclusion: t

This argument is valid because it has the form of a disjunctive syllogism. I have two choices,
and one of them is not going to happen, so the other one must happen.

Keep in mind that, when you are determining the validity of an argument, you must assume
that the premises are true. If you don't agree with one of the premises, you need to keep your
personal opinion out of it. Your job is to pretend that the premises are true and then
determine whether they force you to accept the conclusion. You may attack the premises in a
court of law or a political discussion, of course, but here we are focusing on the structure of
the arguments, not the truth of what they actually say.
                                                                                                   Logic 435

We have just looked at four forms of valid arguments; there are two common forms that
represent invalid arguments, which are also called fallacies.

The Fallacy of the Converse

The fallacy of the converse arises when a conditional and its consequent are given as

premises, and the antecedent is the conclusion. The general form is:

Premise:                p  q

Premise:                q

Conclusion:             p

Notice that the second premise and the conclusion look like the converse of the first premise,
q  p, but they have been detached. The fallacy of the converse incorrectly tries to assert
that the converse of a statement is equivalent to that statement.

Example 40        If I drink coffee after noon, then I have a hard time falling asleep that night.
                  I had a hard time falling asleep last night.
     Premise:     I drank coffee after noon yesterday.
     Premise:
     Conclusion:

If we let c = I drink coffee after noon and h = I have a hard time falling asleep, then our

argument looks like this:

Premise           c  h

Premise           h

Conclusion: c

This argument uses converse reasoning, so it is an invalid argument. There could be plenty of
other reasons why I couldn't fall asleep: I could be worried about money, my neighbors
might have been setting off fireworks, ...

The Fallacy of the Inverse

The fallacy of the inverse occurs when a conditional and the negation of its antecedent

are given as premises, and the negation of the consequent is the conclusion. The

general form is:

Premise:                p  q

Premise:                ~p

Conclusion:             ~q

Again, notice that the second premise and the conclusion look like the inverse of the first
premise, ~p  ~q, but they have been detached. The fallacy of the inverse incorrectly tries to
assert that the inverse of a statement is equivalent to that statement.

Example 41        If you listen to the Grateful Dead, then you are a hippie.
                  Sky doesn't listen to the Grateful Dead.
     Premise:     Sky is not a hippie.
     Premise:
     Conclusion:

If we let g = listen to the Grateful Dead and h = is a hippie, then this is the argument:

Premise           g  h

Premise           ~g

Conclusion: ~h

This argument is invalid because it uses inverse reasoning. The first premise does not imply
that all hippies listen to the Grateful Dead; there could be some hippies who listen to Phish
instead.

Premise:          If a hockey player trips an opponent, he will be assessed a 2-minute penalty.

Premise:          Alexei did not trip an opponent.

Conclusion: Alexei will not be assessed a 2-minute penalty.

Of course, arguments are not limited to these six basic forms; some arguments have more
premises, or premises that need to be rearranged before you can see what is really happening.
There are plenty of other forms of arguments that are invalid. If an argument doesn't seem to
fit the pattern of any of these common forms, though, you may want to use a Venn diagram
or a truth table instead.
                                                                                                         Logic 437

     Lewis Carroll, author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, was a math and logic teacher,
     and wrote two books on logic. In them, he would propose premises as a puzzle, to be
     connected using syllogisms. The following example is one such puzzle.

Example 42
     Solve the puzzle. In other words, find a logical conclusion from these premises.
     All babies are illogical.
     Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile.
     Illogical persons are despised.

     Let b = is a baby, d = is despised, i = is illogical, and m = can manage a crocodile.
     Then we can write the premises as:
     b  i
     m  ~d
     i  d

     Writing the second premise correctly can be a challenge; it can be rephrased as "If you can
     manage a crocodile, then you are not despised."

     Using the transitive property with the first and third premises, we can conclude that b  d;
     that all babies are despised. Using the contrapositive of the second premise, d  ~m, we can
     then use the transitive property with b  d to conclude that b  ~m; that babies cannot
     manage crocodiles. While it is silly, this is a logical conclusion from the given premises.

Example 43        If I work hard, I'll get a raise.
                  If I get a raise, I'll buy a boat.
     Premise:     If I don't buy a boat, I must not have worked hard.
     Premise:
     Conclusion:

If we let h = working hard, r = getting a raise, and b = buying a boat, then we can represent

our argument symbolically:

Premise           h  r

Premise           r  b

Conclusion: ~b  ~h

Using the transitive property with the two premises, we can conclude that h  b; if I work
hard, then I will buy a boat. When we learned about the contrapositive, we saw that the
conditional statement h  b is equivalent to ~b  ~h. Therefore, the conclusion is indeed a
logical syllogism derived from the premises.

     Logical Fallacies in Common Language
     In the previous discussion, we saw that logical arguments can be invalid when the premises
     are not true, when the premises are not sufficient to guarantee the conclusion, or when there
     are invalid chains in logic. There are a number of other ways in which arguments can be
     invalid, a sampling of which are given here.

         Ad hominem
         An ad hominem argument attacks the person making the argument, ignoring the
         argument itself.

Example 44
     "Jane says that whales aren't fish, but she's only in the second grade, so she can't be right."

     Here the argument is attacking Jane, not the validity of her claim, so this is an ad hominem
     argument.

Example 45
     "Jane says that whales aren't fish, but everyone knows that they're really mammals. She's so
     stupid."

     This certainly isn't very nice, but it is not ad hominem since a valid counterargument is made
     along with the personal insult.

         Appeal to ignorance
         This type of argument assumes something it true because it hasn't been proven false.

Example 46
     "Nobody has proven that photo isn't of Bigfoot, so it must be Bigfoot."

         Appeal to authority
         These arguments attempt to use the authority of a person to prove a claim. While often
         authority can provide strength to an argument, problems can occur when the person's
         opinion is not shared by other experts, or when the authority is irrelevant to the claim.

Example 47
     "A diet high in bacon can be healthy; Doctor Atkins said so."

     Here, an appeal to the authority of a doctor is used for the argument. This generally would
     provide strength to the argument, except that the opinion that eating a diet high in saturated
     fat runs counter to general medical opinion. More supporting evidence would be needed to
     justify this claim.
                                                                                                         Logic 439

Example 48
     "Jennifer Hudson lost weight with Weight Watchers, so their program must work."

     Here, there is an appeal to the authority of a celebrity. While her experience does provide
     evidence, it provides no more than any other person's experience would.

         Appeal to consequence
         An appeal to consequence concludes that a premise is true or false based on whether
         the consequences are desirable or not.

Example 49
     "Humans will travel faster than light: faster-than-light travel would be beneficial for space
     travel."

         False dilemma
         A false dilemma argument falsely frames an argument as an "either or" choice, without
         allowing for additional options.

Example 50
     "Either those lights in the sky were an airplane or aliens. There are no airplanes scheduled for
     tonight, so it must be aliens."

     This argument ignores the possibility that the lights could be something other than an
     airplane or aliens.

         Circular reasoning
         Circular reasoning is an argument that relies on the conclusion being true for the
         premise to be true.

Example 51
     "I shouldn't have gotten a C in that class; I'm an A student!"

     In this argument, the student is claiming that because they're an A student, though shouldn't
     have gotten a C. But because they got a C, they're not an A student.

         Post hoc (post hoc ergo propter hoc)
         A post hoc argument claims that because two things happened sequentially, then the
         first must have caused the second.

Example 52
     "Today I wore a red shirt, and my football team won! I need to wear a red shirt every time
     they play to make sure they keep winning."
     440

         Straw man
         A straw man argument involves misrepresenting the argument in a less favorable way
         to make it easier to attack.

Example 53
     "Senator Jones has proposed reducing military funding by 10%. Apparently he wants to leave
     us defenseless against attacks by terrorists"

     Here the arguer has represented a 10% funding cut as equivalent to leaving us defenseless,
     making it easier to attack Senator Jones' position.

         Correlation implies causation
         Similar to post hoc, but without the requirement of sequence, this fallacy assumes that
         just because two things are related one must have caused the other. Often there is a
         third variable not considered.

Example 54
     "Months with high ice cream sales also have a high rate of deaths by drowning. Therefore,
     ice cream must be causing people to drown."

     This argument is implying a causal relation, when really both are more likely dependent on
     the weather; that ice cream and drowning are both more likely during warm summer months.

     Identify the logical fallacy in each of the arguments

     a. Only an untrustworthy person would run for office. The fact that politicians are
          untrustworthy is proof of this.

     b. Since the 1950s, both the atmospheric carbon dioxide level and obesity levels have
          increased sharply. Hence, atmospheric carbon dioxide causes obesity.

     c. The oven was working fine until you started using it, so you must have broken it.
     d. You can't give me a D in the class because I can't afford to retake it.
     e. The senator wants to increase support for food stamps. He wants to take the taxpayers'

          hard-earned money and give it away to lazy people. This isn't fair, so we shouldn't do it.

     It may be difficult to identify one particular fallacy for an argument. Consider this argument:
     "Emma Watson says she's a feminist, but she posed for these racy pictures. I'm a feminist,
     and no self-respecting feminist would do that." Could this be ad hominem, saying that Emma
     Watson has no self-respect? Could it be appealing to authority because the person making the
     argument claims to be a feminist? Could it be a false dilemma because the argument assumes
     that a woman is either a feminist or not, with no gray area in between?

   We could try to rewrite the second premise using the contrapositive to state ~f  ~p, but
   that does not allow us to form a syllogism. If I don't see friends, then I didn't go the party,
   but that is not sufficient to claim I won't be tired tomorrow. Maybe I stayed up all night

7. absolute increase: 1050. Relative: 1050/3250 = 0.323 = 32.3% increase

9. a. 2200 - 2200(0.15) = 2200(0.85) = $1870
  b. Yes, their goal was to decrease by at least 15%. They exceeded their goal.

11. Dropping by 6% is the same as keeping 94%. a(0.94) = 300. a = 319.15. Attendance
     was about 319 before the drop.

13. a) Kaplan's enrollment was 64.3% larger than Walden's. 30510
 b) Walden's enrollment was 39.1% smaller than Kaplan's.
 c) Walden's enrollment was 60.9% of Kaplan's.

15. If the original price was $100, the basic clearance price would be $100 - $100(0.60) =
     $40. The additional markdown would bring it to $40 - $40(0.30) = $28. This is 28% of
     the original price.

17. These are not comparable; "a" is using a base of all Americans and is talking about
     health insurance from any source, while "b" is using a base of adults and is talking
     specifically about health insurance provided by employers.

21. These statements are equivalent, if we assume the claim in "a" is a percentage point
     increase, not a relative change. Certainly these messages are phrased to convey different
     opinions of the levy. We are told the new rate will be $9.33 per $1000, which is
     0.933% tax rate. If the original rate was 0.833% (0.1 percentage point lower), then this
     would indeed be a 12% relative increase.

23. 20% of 30% is 30%(0.20) = 6%, a 6 percentage point decrease.

25. Probably not, unless the final is worth 50% of the overall class grade. If the final was
    worth 25% of the overall grade, then a 100% would only raise her average to 77.5%

27. $4/10 pounds = $0.40 per pound (or 10 pounds/$4 = 2.5 pounds per dollar)

43. The population density of the US is 84 people per square mile. The density of India is
    about 933 people per square mile. The density of India is about 11 times greater than that
    of the U.S.

49. The oil in the spill could produce 93.1 million gallons of gasoline. Each car uses about
    600 gallons a year. That would fuel 155,167 cars for a year.

53. An answer around 100-300 gallons would be reasonable

57. 156 million miles

59. The time it takes the light to reach you is so tiny for any reasonable distance that we can
     safely ignore it. 750 miles/hr is about 0.21 miles/sec. If the sound takes 4 seconds to
     reach you, the lightning is about 0.84 miles away. In general, the lightning will be 0.21n
     miles away, which is often approximated by dividing the number of seconds by 5.

61. About 8.2 minutes

63. Four cubic yards (or 3.7 if they sell partial cubic yards)

   21. If adding a player to a coalition could cause it to reach quota, that player would also be
   critical in that coalition, which means they are not a dummy. So a dummy cannot be pivotal.

   23. We know P2+P3 can't reach quota, or else P1 wouldn't have veto power.
        P1 can't reach quota alone.
        P1+P2 and P1+P3 must reach quota or else P2/P3 would be dummy.

11. If n is in hours, better to start with the explicit form. P0 = 300. P4 = 500 = 300(1+r)4
    500/300 = (1+r)4. 1+r = 1.136. r = 0.136
    a. P0 = 300. Pn = (1.136)Pn-1
    b. Pn = 300(1.136)n
    c. P24 = 300(1.136)24 = 6400 bacteria
    d. 300(1.136)n = 900. n = log(3)/log(1.136) = about 8.62 hours

13. a. P0 = 100 Pn = Pn-1 + 0.70 (1 - Pn-1 / 2000) Pn-1

    c. P2 = 166.5 + 0.70(1 - 166.5/2000)(166.5) = 273.3

15. To find the growth rate, suppose n=0 was 1968. Then P0 would be 1.60 and P8 = 2.30 =
    1.60(1+r)8, r = 0.0464. Since we want n=0 to correspond to 1960, then we don't know
    P0, but P8 would 1.60 = P0(1.0464)8. P0 = 1.113.
   a. Pn = 1.113(1.0464)n
   b. P0= $1.113, or about $1.11
   c. 1996 would be n=36. P36 = 1.113(1.0464)36 = $5.697. Actual is slightly lower.

67. There is only 1 way to arrange 5 CD's in alphabetical order. The probability that the CD's
are in alphabetical order is one divided by the total number of ways to arrange 5 CD's. Since
alphabetical order is only one of all the possible orderings you can either use permutations, or
simply use 5!. P(alphabetical) = 1/5! = 1/(5 P 5) = 1 .
