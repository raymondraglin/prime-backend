Preface

My goal is to help you learn calculus. It is a beautiful subject and its central ideas
are not so hard. Everything comes from the relation between two different functions.
Here are two important examples:

Function .1/ The distance a car travels Function .2/ Its speed

Function .1/ The height of a graph  Function .2/ Its slope

Function (2) is telling us how quickly Function (1) is changing. The distance will
change quickly or slowly based on the speed. The height changes quickly or slowly
based on the slope. You see the same in climbing -- Function .1/ can be the height of
a mountain and Function .2/ is its steepness. The height and the distance in Function
.1/ are "running totals" that add up the changes that come from Function .2/.

  The clearest example is when the speed is CONSTANT. The distance is steadily
increasing. If you travel at 50 miles per hour, or at 80 kilometers per hour, then
after 3 hours you know the distance traveled. I can write the answer by multiplying
3 times 50 or 3 times 80. I can write the formula using algebra, which allows any
constant speed s and any time of travel t:

The distance f at constant speed s in travel time t is f D s times t.

We don't need calculus when the speed is constant or the slope is constant:

If s D slope and x D distance across; the distance up is y D s times x.

Those rules find Function .1/ from Function .2/: We can also find Function .2/ from
Function .1/: To know the speed or the slope, divide instead of multiplying:

speed s D distance f                slope s D distance up
             travel time t                      distance across

From the distance, we find the speed. This is Differential Calculus. Knowing the
speed s, we find the distance f: This is Integral Calculus.

  Algebra is enough for this example of constant speed. But when s is continually
changing, and we speed up or slow down, then multiplication and division are not
enough! A new idea is needed and that idea is the heart of calculus.
vi          Preface

      Differential Calculus finds Function .2/ from Function .1/. We recover the
    speedometer information from knowing the trip distance at all times.

      Integral Calculus goes the other way. The "integral" adds up small pieces, to get
    the total distance traveled. That integration brings back Function .1/.

    Function .1/ is f .t/ or y.x/ (2) Its "derivative" s is df=dt or dy=dx

    The derivative in Function .2/ is the "rate of change" of Function .1/. The book will
    explain the meaning of these symbols df =dt and dy=dx for the derivative.

            CHANGING SPEED AND CHANGING SLOPE

    Let me take a first step into the real problem of calculus, when s is not constant.
    Now Function .1/ will not have a straight line graph. The speed and the slope of the
    graph will change, but only every hour. From the numbers you can see the pattern:

    Distances 0 1 4 9 16 Subtract the distances to get Function (2)

    Speeds  1 3 5 7 Add up the speeds to get Function (1)

    Going from .1/ to .2/ we are subtracting, as in 4 ¡ 1 D 3 and 9 ¡ 4 D 5. Those

    differences 3 and 5 are the speeds in the second hour and third hour.

    Going from .2/ to .1/ we are adding, as in 1 C 3 C 5 D 9: The trip meter adds up the
    distances from hours 1 and 2 and 3. Addition is the opposite of subtraction.

      The essential point of calculus is to see this same pattern in "continuous time."
    It's not enough to look at the total or the change every hour or every minute.
    The distance and speed can be changing at every instant. In that case addition
    and subtraction are not enough. The central idea of calculus is continuous change.

      There are so many pairs like .1/ and .2/--not just cars and graphs and mountains.
    This is what makes calculus important. The functions are changing continuously--not
    just in finite steps. This is what makes calculus different from arithmetic and algebra.

                                         IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS

    Let me repeat the right name for the step from .1/ to .2/: When we know the
    distance or the height or the function f .x/; calculus can find the speed (velocity) and
    the slope and the derivative. That is differential calculus, going from Function .1/
    to Function .2/: It will take time to find the slopes (the derivatives) for the examples
    we need.

      I finally realized that the list of truly essential functions is not extremely long!
    I now include only five special choices for y.x/ or f .t/ on my basic list:

    Important functions xn sin x and cos x ex and ln x

    For those distance functions, the speed (the slope) is continually changing. If we
    divide the total distance by the total time, we only know one number: the
    average speed. What calculus finds is the speed at each separate moment--the
    whole history of speed from the whole history of distance.
Preface                                                                                     vii

  Your car has a speedometer to tell the derivative. It has a trip meter to tell the total
mileage. They have the same information, recorded in different ways. From a record
of the speeds we could recover a lost trip meter and vice versa. One black box is
enough, we could recover the other one :

     The derivative (speedometer) tells how the distance is changing.

     The integral (odometer) adds up the changes to f nd the distance.

  This is the "Big Picture" and the details are in this book. We need examples, we
need formulas, we need rules, and especially we want and need applications -- how
to use this subject that you are learning.

                                          VIDEO LECTURES

This book is supplemented by a series of 17 video lectures on "Highlights of
Calculus". These are on MIT's OpenCourseWare site ocw.mit.edu and they are
freely available to all viewers. My hope is to help students and teachers everywhere.
https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/

  At this moment I cannot know all the ways the videos may be used (my website
math.mit.edu/~gs will try to keep up to date). OpenCourseWare on ocw.mit.edu
is the focus of this plan. That site has notes and reading materials for almost 2000
MIT courses. For large classes there are also videos. The linear algebra lectures have
had 2 million viewers (amazing). Those videos for the 18:06 course can help for
review (at any hour ! ). There is also the next course 18:085 on Computational
Science and Engineering.

  One plan is to include these calculus videos on "Highlights for High School"
within ocw.mit.edu. The highlights are shorter than the full multi-semester subject
18:01-18:02: I started with the idea that it must be so easy to get lost in a calculus
textbook of 1000 pages. (This book is not so long, but still there is a lot to learn.)
The video lectures go far beyond the page you are reading now, to help you capture
the main ideas of calculus.

  Many ideas from these videos on Highlights of Calculus are repeated and
developed in Chapter 0 of this book. In addition to these, Cleve Moler (the creator
of MATLAB) has joined me in a long series of short videos on a recent book :
Differential Equations and Linear Algebra (math.mit.edu/dela). The link to these
videos is :

                                 THE EXPONENTIAL y D ex

There is one special function that I want to mention separately. It is created by calculus
(not seen in algebra because a limit is involved). This is the function y D ex, and
one big question for the new Section 0:3 is how to construct it.

  My answer now is not one of the usual four or f ve ways. All those def nitions
of ex seem rather indirect and subtle. Instead I will try a direct attack that only uses
the powers xn. At that point of the book, the functions y D 1; x; : : : ; xn have known
slopes. We are looking for the magic function y D ex that equals its own slope.

  Then Function .1/ equals Function .2/ ! See what you think of this approach.

CHAPTER 16 Mathematics after Calculus
           To the Student

I hope you will learn calculus from this book. On this page I will admit that I even
hope for more. If you find that the explanations are clear, and also the purpose is
clear--that means you see not only equations but ideas. Then the book was worth
writing, and the course is a success.

  I am trying to say that this subject is alive. As long as there are problems to solve,
mathematics will keep growing. It is not wrapped up inside some giant formula!
We want to know the chance of winning the Florida lottery (Chapter 2). You can
see the meaning of an electrocardiogram (Chapter 3), and where we are on the pop-
ulation S-curve. There is no reason to pretend that mathematics has all the answers.
This book is really the life story of an idea--which isn't finished.

  Most of mathematics is about patterns and functions. There is a pattern in the
graphs of Section 1:6 (which I don't understand). There is a pattern in the slopes
of x2 and x3 and xn (which you will understand). They change as x changes.
Every function contains a whole history of growth or decay. The pattern is sometimes
clear and sometimes hidden--the goal is to find it.

  The reader will understand that calculus is not all sweetness and light. There is
work to do. You absolutely have to solve problems--and think carefully. As one of
my students said, "My God, I have to read the words." I guess that's true, and I hope
the words come to the point. The book will try not to waste your time. Its object is
not to "cover" material, but to uncover and explain it. In the end, teaching a subject
comes down to teaching a person.

  It is not easy to stay inspired for a year--probably impossible. But mathematics
is more active and cheerful than most people know. This book was written in a happy
spirit, with a serious purpose--I hope you enjoy it.

                                          A SMALL REWARD
Some mistakes may have crept into the solutions. I still have the ten dimes that
George Thomas offered in 1952; for correcting ten errors. This reward is hereby
increased to $e. It should be et but that could grow exponentially. More important :
All suggestions are welcome. Please write about any part of the book or the videos.

      Highlights of Calculus

      0.1 Distance and Speed == Height and Slope

      Calculus is about functions. I use that word "functions" in the first sentence,
      because we can't go forward without it. Like all other words, we learn this one in
      two different ways: We define the word and we use the word.

        I believe that seeing examples of functions, and using the word to explain those
      examples, is a fast and powerful way to learn. I will start with three examples:

      Linear function          y.x/ D 2x
      Squaring function        y.x/ D x2
      Exponential function     y.x/ D 2x

      The first point is that those are not the same! Their formulas involve 2 and x in very
      different ways. When I draw their graphs (this is a good way to understand functions)
      you see that all three are increasing when x is positive. The slopes are positive.

        When the input x increases (moving to the right), the output y also increases
      (the graph goes upward). The three functions increase at different rates.

     Near the start at x D 0, the first function increases the fastest. But the others soon
   catch up. All three graphs reach the same height y D 4 when x D 2: Beyond that
   point the second graph y D x2 pulls ahead. At x D 3 the squaring function reaches
   y D 32 D 9, while the height of the third graph is only y D 23 D 8:

     Don't be deceived, the exponential will win. It pulls even at x D 4, because 42 and
   24 are both 16. Then y D 2x moves ahead of y D x2 and it stays ahead. When you
   reach x D 10, the third graph will have y D 210 D 1024 compared to y D 102 D 100:

     The graphs themselves are a straight line and a parabola and an exponential.
   The straight line has constant growth rate. The parabola has increasing growth rate.
   The exponential curve has exponentially increasing growth rate. I emphasize these
   because calculus is all about growth rates.

     The whole point of differential calculus is to discover the growth rate of a function,
   and to use that information. So there are actually two functions in play at the
   same time--the original function and its growth rate. Before I go further down
   this all-important road, let me give a working definition of a function y.x/:

         A function has inputs x and outputs y.x/. To each x it assigns one y.

   The inputs x come from the "domain" of the function. In our graphs the domain
   contained all numbers x 0. The outputs y form the "range" of the function. The
   ranges for the first two functions y D 2x and y D x2 contained all numbers y 0.
   But the range for y D 2x is limited to y 1 when the domain is x 0.

     Since these examples are so important, let me also allow x to be negative.
   The three graphs are shown below. Strictly speaking, these are new functions! Their
   domains have been extended to all real numbers x. Notice that the three ranges are
   also different:

          The range of y D 2x is all real numbers y
          The range of y D x2 is all nonnegative numbers y 0
          The range of y D 2x is all positive numbers y 0

   y                      y                         y
            y D 2x                    y D x2                  y D 2x

                       x                      x                         x

     One more note about the idea of a function, and then calculus can begin. We have
   seen the three most popular ways to describe a function:

      1. Give a formula to find y from x. Example: y.x/ D 2x:
      2. Give a graph that shows x (distance across) and y (distance up).
      3. Give the input-output pairs (x in the domain and y in the range).
0.1 Distance and Speed == Height and Slope                                                 3

In a high-level definition, the "function" is the set of all the input-output pairs. We
could also say: The function is the rule that assigns an output y in the range to every
input x in the domain.

  This shows something that we see for other words too. Logically, the definition
should come first. Practically, we understand the definition better after we know
examples that use the word. Probably that is the way we learn other words and also
the way we will learn calculus. Examples show the general idea, and the definition
is more precise. Together, we get it right.

  The first words in this book were Calculus is about functions. Now I have to
update that.

                                       PAIRS OF FUNCTIONS

Calculus is about pairs of functions. Call them Function (1) and Function (2).
Our graphs of y D 2x and y D x2 and y D 2x were intended to be examples of
Function (1). Then we discussed the growth rates of those three examples. The
growth rate of Function (1) is Function (2). This is our first task--to find the
growth rate of a function. Differential calculus starts with a formula for
Function .1/ and aims to produce a formula for Function .2/:

  Let me say right away how calculus operates. There are two ways to compute how
quickly y changes when x changes:

Method 1 (Limits): Write Change in y D y . Take the limit of this ratio as x 0.
                               Change in x x

Method 2 (Rules): Follow a rule to produce new growth rates from known rates.

For each new function y.x/, look to see if it can be produced from known
functions--obeying one of the rules. An important part of learning calculus is
to see different ways of producing new functions from old. Then we follow the
rules for the growth rate.

  Suppose the new function is not produced from known functions (2x is not
produced from 2x or x2). Then we have to find its growth rate directly. By
"directly" I mean that we compute a limit which is Function (2). This book will
explain what a "limit" means and how to compute it.

  Here we begin with examples--almost always the best way. I will state the
growth rates "dy=dx" for the three functions we are working with:

Function (1)    y D 2x    y D x2   y D 2x
Function (2)  dy D 2    dy D 2x   dy D 2x.ln 2/
              dx        dx        dx

The linear function y D 2x has constant growth rate dy=dx D 2. This section will
take that first and easiest step. It is our opportunity to connect the growth rate to the
slope of the graph. The ratio of up to across is 2x=x which is 2.

  Section 0:2 takes the next step. The squaring function y D x2 has linear growth rate
dy=dx D 2x. (This requires the idea of a limit--so fundamental to calculus.) Then we
can introduce our first two rules:

 Constant factor The growth rate of Cy.x/ is C times the growth rate of y.x/.

 Sum of functions The growth rate of y1 C y2 is the sum of the two growth rates.
4                     0 Highlights of Calculus

   The first rule says that y D 5x2 has growth rate 10x. The factor C D 5 multiplies
   the growth rate 2x. The second rule says that y1 C y2 D 5x2 C 2x has growth rate
   10x C 2. Notice how we immediately took 5x2 as a function y1 with a known growth

   rate. Together, the two rules give the growth rate for any "linear combination" of

   y1 and y2:

   The growth rate of C1y1 C C2y2 is that same combination C1 dy1 C C2 dy2 .
                                                    dx  dx

   In words, the step from Function (1) to Function (2) is linear. The slope of y D x2 ¡ x
   is dy=dx D 2x ¡ 1. This rule is simple but so important.

     Finally, Section 0:3 will present the exponential functions y D 2x and y D ex.

   Our first job is their meaning--what is "2 to the power " ? We understand
   23 D 8 and 24 D 16, but how can we multiply 2 by itself  times?

     When we meet ex, we are seeing the great creation of calculus. This is a function

   with the remarkable property that dy=dx D y. The slope equals the function. This

   requires the amazing number e, which was never seen in algebra--because it only

   appears when you take the right limit.

   So these first sections compute growth rates for three essential functions. We are

   ready for y D 2x.

                      THE SLOPE OF A GRAPH

   The slope is distance up divided by distance across. I am thinking now about the

   graph of a function y.x/. The "distance across" is the change x2 ¡ x1 in the inputs,
   from x1 to x2. The "distance up" is the change y2 ¡ y1 in the outputs, from y1 to y2.
   The slope is large and the graph is steep when y2 ¡ y1 is much larger than x2 ¡ x1.

   Change in y divided by change in x matches our ordinary meaning of the word slope:

                Average slope D change in y D y2 ¡ y1 D y : (1)
                              change in x x2 ¡ x1 x

   I introduced the very useful Greek letter  (delta), as a symbol for change. We take

   a step of length x to go from x1 to x2. For the height y.x/ on the graph, that

   produces a step y D y2 ¡ y1. The ratio of y to x, up divided by across, is the

   average slope between x1 and x2. The slope is the steepness.

     Important point: I had to say "average" because the slope could be changing as
   we go. The graph of y D x2 shows an increasing slope. Between x1 D 1 and x2 D 2,
   what is the average slope for y D x2 ? Divide y by x:

   y1 D 1 at x1 D 1   Average slope D 4 ¡ 1 D y D 3:
   y2 D 4 at x2 D 2                 2¡1 x

   Between x1 D 0 and x2 D 2, we get a different answer (not 3). This graph of x2
   shows the problem of calculus, to deal with changes in slope and changes in speed.

     The graph of y D 2x has constant slope. The ratio of y to x, distance up to
   distance across, is always 2:

   Constant slope     y D y2 ¡ y1 D 2x2 ¡ 2x1 D 2:
                      x x2 ¡ x1 x2 ¡ x1

   The mathematics is easy, which gives me a chance to emphasize the words and the
   ideas:

   Constant slope                                                 Changing slope

When Function (1) is y D C x, the ratio y=x is always C . A linear function has
a constant slope. And those same functions can come from driving a car at constant
speed:

Function (1) D Distance traveled D C t Function (2) D Speed of the car D C

For a graph of Function (1), its rate of change is the slope. When Function (1)
measures distance traveled, its rate of change is the speed (or velocity). When
Function .1/ measures our height, its rate of change is our growth rate.

  The first point is that functions are everywhere. For calculus, those functions
come in pairs. Function .2/ is the rate of change of Function .1/:

  The second point is that Function (1) and Function (2) are measured in different
units. That is natural:

 miles     
   Speed in                   multiplies Time in hours to give Distance in miles
                   hour

 inches                                                                                             

Growth rate in            year     multiplies Time in years to give Height in inches

When time is in seconds and distance is in meters, then speed is automatically in
meters per second. We can choose two units, and they decide the third. Function (2)
always involves a division: y is divided by x or distance is divided by time.

  The delicate and tricky part of calculus is coming next. We want the slope at one
point and the speed at one instant. What is the rate of change in zero time ?

The distance across is x D 0 at a point. The distance up is y D 0. Formally,

their ratio is  0  .  It  is  the  inspiration  of  calculus  to  give  this  a  useful  meaning.

     0.2 The Changing Slope of y D x2 and y D xn

The second of our three examples is y D x2: Now the slope is changing as we move
up the curve. The average slope is still y=x; but that is not our final goal. We have
to answer the crucial questions of differential calculus:

     What is the meaning of "slope at a point" and how can we compute it ?

My video lecture on Big Picture: Derivatives also faces those questions. Every
student of calculus soon reaches this same problem. What is the meaning of "rate
of change" when we are at a single moment in time, and nothing actually changes
in that moment ? Good question.

  The answers will come in two steps. Algebra produces y=x; and then calculus
finds dy=dx: Those steps dy and dx are infinitesimally short, so formally we are
looking at 0=0: Trying to define dy and dx and 0=0 is not wise, and I won't do it.
The successful plan is to realize that the ratio of y to x is clearly defined, and
those two numbers can become very small. If that ratio y=x approaches a limit,
we have a perfect answer:

The slope at x is the limit of  y D y.x Cx/ ¡ y.x/ :
                                x  x

The distance across, from x to x C x; is just x: The distance up is from y.x/ to
y.x C x/: Let me show how algebra leads directly to y=x when y D x2:

     y .x C x/2 ¡ x2 x2 C 2xx C .x/2 ¡ x2

        x x D D x D 2x C x:

Notice that calculation! The "leading terms" x2 and ¡x2 cancel. The important term

here is 2xx: This "first-order term" is responsible for most of y: The "second-
order term" in this example is .x/2: After we divide by x; this term is still small.
That part .x/2=x will disappear as the step size x goes to zero.

  That limiting process x 0 produces the slope dy=dx at a point. The first-
order term survives in dy=dx and higher-order terms disappear.

Slope at a point  dy D limit of y D limit of 2x C x D 2x:
                  dx            x

Algebra produced y=x: In the limit, calculus gave us dy=dx: Look at the
graph, to see the geometry of those steps. The ratio up=across D y=x is the slope
between two points on the graph. The two points come together in the limit.
Then y=x approaches the slope dy=dx at a single point.

The color lines connecting points on the first two graphs are called "chords."
They approach the color line on the third graph, which touches at only one point.
This is the "tangent line" to the curve. Here is the idea of differential calculus:

                        Slope of tangent line D Slope of curve D Function .2/ D dy D 2x:
                                                                                                 dx

To find the equation for this tangent line, return to algebra. Choose any specific

value                   x0:  Above    that  position  on  the  x  axis,  the  graph  is  at  height  y0  D  x2   :

                                                                                                              0

The slope of the tangent line at that point of the graph is dy=dx D 2x0:

We want the equation for the line through that point with that slope.

                        Equation for the tangent line             y ¡ y0 D .2x0/.x ¡ x0/                 (1)

At the point where x D x0 and y D y0; this equation becomes 0 D 0: The equation is
satisfied and the point is on the line. Furthermore the slope of the line matches the

slope 2x0 of the curve. You see that directly if you divide both sides by x ¡ x0:

                        Tangent line        up D y ¡ y0 D 2x0 is the correct slope dy :
                                      across x ¡ x0                                          dx

  Let me say this again. The curve y D x2 is bending, the tangent line is straight.

This line stays as close to the curve as possible, near the point where they touch.
The tangent line gives a linear approximation to the nonlinear function y D x2:

   Linear approximation y y0 C .2x0/.x ¡ x0/ D y0 C dy .x ¡ x0/ (2)

                                                                             dx

I only moved y0 to the right side of equation (1). Then I used the symbol for
"approximately equal" because the symbol D would be wrong: The curve bends.

  Important for the future: This bending comes from the second derivative of y D x2:
0.2 The Changing Slope of y D x2 and y D xn                                                   11

                                    THE SECOND DERIVATIVE

   The first derivative is the slope dy=dx D 2x: The second derivative is the slope
of the slope. By good luck we found the slope of 2x in the previous section (easy to
do, it is just the constant 2). Notice the symbol d 2y=dx2 for the slope of the slope:

d2y                                dy                         d 2y
Second derivative dx2 The slope of dx D 2x is dx2 D 2: (3)

  In ordinary language, the first derivative dy=dx tells how fast the function y.x/ is

changing. The second derivative tells whether we are speeding up or slowing down.
The example y D x2 is certainly speeding up, since the graph is getting steeper. The

curve is bending and the tangent line is steepening.
  Think also about y D x2 on the left side (the negative side) of x D 0: The graph

is coming down to zero. Its slope is certainly negative. But the curve is still bending
upwards! The algebra agrees with this picture: The slope dy=dx D 2x is negative on
the left side of x D 0; but the second derivative d 2y=dx2 D 2 is still positive.

  An economist or an investor watches all three of those numbers: y.x/ tells where

the economy is, and dy=dx tells which way it is going (short term, close to the
tangent line). But it is d 2y=dx2 that reveals the longer term prediction. I am

writing these words near the end of the economic downturn (I hope). I am sorry that
dy=dx has been negative but happy that d 2y=dx2 has recently been positive.

DISTANCE AND SPEED AND ACCELERATION

An excellent example of y.x/ and dy=dx and d 2y=dx2 comes from driving a car.
The function y is the distance traveled. Its rate of change (first derivative) is the speed.
The rate of change of the speed (second derivative) is the acceleration. If you are
pressing on the gas pedal, all three will be positive. If you are pressing on the brake,
the distance and speed are probably still positive but the acceleration is negative:
The speed is dropping. If the car is in reverse and you are braking, what then ?

The speed is negative (going backwards)
The speed is increasing (less negative)
The acceleration is positive (increasing speed).

The video lecture mentions that car makers don't know calculus. The distance
meter on the dashboard does not go back toward zero (in reverse gear it should).
The speedometer does not go below zero (it should). There is no meter at all (on my
car) for acceleration. Spaceships do have accelerometers, and probably aircraft too.

We often hear that an astronaut or a test pilot is subjected to a high number of g's.

The ordinary acceleration in free fall is one g; from the gravity of the Earth. An

airplane in a dive and a rocket at takeoff will have a high second derivative--the

rocket may be hardly moving but it is accelerating like mad.

One more very useful point about this example of motion. The natural letter to use

is not x but t. The distance is a function of time. The slope of a graph is up=across,

but now the right ratio is (change of distance) divided by (change in time):

Average speed between t and t C t  y D y.t Ct/ ¡ y.t/
                                   t                          t

Speed at t itself (instant speed)  dy D limit of y as t 0
                                   dt                         t
12                    0 Highlights of Calculus

    The words "rate of change" and "rate of growth" suggest t. The word "slope"
    suggests x: But calculus doesn't worry much about the letters we use. If we graph
    the distance traveled as a function of time, then the x axis (across) becomes the
    t axis. And the slope of that graph becomes the speed (velocity is the best word).

      Here is something not often seen in calculus books--the second difference.

    We know the first difference y D y.t C t/ ¡ y.t/. It is the change in y: The

    second difference 2y is the change in y:

    Second      2y D .y.t Ct/ ¡ y.t// ¡ .y.t/ ¡ y.t ¡ t//  2y      d2y
    difference                                             . t /2  dt2 (4)

    2y simplifies to y.t C t/ ¡ 2y.t/ C y.t ¡ t/: We divide by .t/2 to

    approximate the acceleration. In the limit as t 0, this ratio 2y=.t/2
    becomes the second derivative d2y=dt2.

                      THE SLOPE OF y D xn

    The slope of y D x2 is dy=dx D 2x: Now I want to compute the slopes of y D x3
    and y D x4 and all succeeding powers y D xn: The rate of increase of xn will be
    found again in Section 2:2: But there are two reasons to discover these special

    derivatives early:

    1. Their pattern is simple: The slope of each power y D xn is dy D nxn¡1:

                                                                                 dx
    2. The next section can then introduce y D ex: This amazing function has dy D y:

                                                                                            dx

    Of course y D x2 fits into this pattern for xn: The exponent drops by 1 from n D 2

    to n ¡ 1 D 1. Also n D 2 multiplies that lower power to give nxn¡1 D 2x:

      The slope of y D x3 is dy=dx D 3x2. Watch how 3x2 appears in y=x:

    y D .x C x/3 ¡ x3 D x3 C 3x2 x C 3x.x/2 C .x/3 ¡ x3 : (5)
    x              x                       x

    Cancel x3 with ¡x3: Then divide by x:

    Average slope     y D 3x2 C 3xx C .x/2:
                      x

    When the step length x goes to zero, the limit value dy=dx is 3x2: This is nxn¡1.

      To establish this pattern for n D 4; 5; 6; : : : the only hard part is .x C x/n: When

    n was 3; we multiplied this out in equation (5) above. The result will always start

    with xn: We claim that the next term (the "first-order term" in y) will be nxn¡1x:

    When we divide this part of y by x; we have the answer we want--the correct

    derivative nxn¡1 of y.x/ D xn:
      How to see that term nxn¡1x ? Our multiplications showed that 2xx and

    3x2x are correct for n D 2 and 3. Then we can reach n D 4 from n D 3:

                .x C x/4 D .x C x/3 times .x C x/

                        D .x3 C3x2x C¤ ¤ ¤ / times .x Cx/

    That multiplication produces x4 and 4x3x, exactly what we want. We can go from
    each n to the next one in the same way (this is called "induction"). The derivatives of

    all the powers x4, x5; : : :, xn are 4x3, 5x4; : : :, nxn¡1.
        0.2 The Changing Slope of y D x2 and y D xn                                  13

  Section 2:2 of the book shows you a slightly different proof of this formula.
And the video lecture on the Product Rule explains one more way. Look at xnC1
as the product of xn times x, and use the rule for the slope of y1 times y2:

Product Rule Slope of y1y2 D y2 (slope of y1) C y1 (slope of y2) (6)

With y1 D xn and y2 D x, the slope of y1y2 D xnC1 comes out right:

        x.slope of xn/ C xn.slope of x/ D x.nxn¡1/ C xn.1/ D .n C 1/xn: (7)

Again we can increase n one step at a time. Soon comes the truly valuable fact that
this derivative formula is correct for all powers y D xn. The exponent n can be

negative, or a fraction, or any number at all. The slope dy=dx is always nxn¡1.

  By combining different powers of x, you know the slope of every "polynomial."
An example is y D x C x2=2 C x3=3. Compute dy=dx one term at a time, as the

Sum Rule allows:

                     d x C C D 1 C x C x  x2 x3  2:
                     dx         23

The slope of the slope is d 2y=dx2 D 1 C 2x. The fourth derivative is zero!

Function (1) tells us the height y above each point x

The problem is to find the "instant slope" at x

This slope s.x/ is written  dy  It is Function (2)

0.3 The Exponential y D ex                                                                15

                 0.3 The Exponential y D ex

The great function that calculus creates is the exponential y D ex: There are different
ways to reach this function, and Section 6.2 of this textbook mentions five ways.
Here I will describe the approach to ex that I now like best. It uses the derivative of
xn; the first thing we learn.

  In all approaches, a "limiting step" will be involved. So the amazing number
e D 2:7 : : : is not seen in algebra (e is not a fraction). The question is where to
take that limiting step, and my answer starts with this truly remarkable fact:
When y D ex is Function .1/, it is also Function .2/.

            The exponential function y D ex solves the equation dy D y:
                                                                               dx

The function equals its slope. This is a first example of a differential equation--
connecting an unknown function y with its own derivatives. Fortunately dy=dx D y
is the most important differential equation--a model that other equations try to follow.

  I will add one more requirement, to eliminate solutions like y D 2ex and y D 8ex:
When y D ex solves our equation, all other functions C ex solve it too. (C D 2
and C D 8 will appear on both sides of dy=dx D y, and they cancel.) At x D 0,
e0 will be the "zeroth power" of the positive number e: All zeroth powers are 1.
So we want y D ex to equal 1 when x D 0:

          y D ex is the solution of dy D y that starts from y D 1 at x D 0.
                                          dx

  Before solving dy=dx D y, look at what this equation means. When y starts
from 1 at x D 0, its slope is also 1. So y increases. Therefore dy=dx also increases,
staying equal to y: So y increases faster. The graph gets steeper as the function
climbs higher. This is what "growing exponentially" means.

                                       INTRODUCING ex

Exponential growth is quite ordinary and reasonable. When a bank pays interest on
your money, the interest is proportional to the amount you have. After the interest is
added, you have more. The new interest is based on the higher amount. Your wealth
is growing "geometrically," one step at a time.

  At the end of this section on ex; I will come back to continuous compounding--
interest is added at every instant instead of every year. That word "continuous"
signals that we need calculus. There is a limiting step, from every year or month
or day or second to every instant. You don't get infinite interest, you do get
exponentially increasing interest.

  I will also describe other ways to introduce ex: This is an important question with
many answers! I like equation (1) below, because we know the derivative of each
power xn. If you take their derivatives in equation (1), you get back the same ex:
amazing. So that sum solves dy=dx D y; starting from y D 1 as we wanted.

  The difficulty is that the sum involves every power xn: an infinite series. When
I go step by step, you will see that those powers are all needed. For this infinite
series, I am asking you to believe that everything works. We can add the series
to get ex; and we can add all derivatives to see that the slope of ex is ex:

  For me, the advantage of using only the powers xn is overwhelming.

                                       CONSTRUCTING y D ex
    I will solve dy=dx D y a step at a time. At the start, y D 1 means that dy=dx D 1:

    Start           yD1          Change y                yD1Cx                         dy                y D 1Cx
                                                                            Change
            dy=dx D 1                            dy=dx D 1                               dx dy=dx D 1 C x

    After the first change, y D 1 C x has the correct derivative dy=dx D 1: But then I
    had to change dy=dx to keep it equal to y: And I can't stop there:

              yD1Cx        Update y to 1 C x C 1 x2 Then update dy to 1 C x C 1 x2
        dy=dx D 1 C x                                    2                               dx                    2

    The extra 12 x2 gave the correct x in the slope. Then 12 x2 also had to go into dy=dx,
    to keep it equal to y: Now we need a new term with this derivative 12 x2:

      The term that gives 12 x2 has x3 divided by 6: The derivative of xn is nxn¡1, so I

    must divide by n (to cancel correctly). Then the derivative of x3=6 is 3x2=6 D 12 x2
    as we wanted. After that comes x4 divided by 24:

                       x3  D         x3             has slope          x2
                                                    has slope
                           6 .3/.2/.1/                                .2/.1/

                       x4            x4                                     4x3                x3
                           D                                                             D:
                       24 .4/.3/.2/.1/                                .4/.3/.2/.1/ 6

    The pattern becomes more clear. The xn term is divided by n factorial, which is nS D

    .n/.n ¡ 1/ : : : .1/: The first five factorials are 1; 2; 6; 24; 120: The derivative
    of that term xn=nS is the previous term xn¡1=.n ¡ 1/S (because the n's cancel).

    As long as we don't stop, this sum of infinitely many terms does achieve dy=dx D y:

                    y.x/   D     ex  D  1  C  x  C  1  x2   C  1  x3  C  ¤  ¤  ¤  C  1   xn  C  ¤  ¤  ¤              (1)
                                                    2          6                     nS

    If we substitute x D 10 into this series, do the infinitely many terms add to a finite
    number e10 ? Yes. The numbers nS grow much faster than 10n (or any other xn).
    So the terms xn=nS in this "exponential series" become extremely small as n :
    Analysis shows that the sum of the series (which is y D ex) does achieve dy=dx D y:

    Note 1  Let        me  just  remember        a  series  that  you    know,       1   C  1  C   1  C  1  C  ¤  ¤  ¤  D  2  :
                                                                                            2      4     8
                    1                                                             1CxCx2 Cx3 C¤¤¤
    If  I  replace  2  by  x,  this  becomes        the  geometric    series                                            and
    it adds up to 1=.1 ¡ x/: This is the most important series in mathematics, but it
    runs into a problem at x D 1: the infinite sum 1 C 1 C 1 C 1 C ¤ ¤ ¤ doesn't "converge."
        I emphasize that the series for ex is always safe, because the powers xn

    are divided by the rapidly growing numbers nS D n factorial. This is a great

    example to meet, long before you learn more about convergence and divergence.

    Note 2 Here is another way to look at that series for ex: Start with xn and take

    its derivative n times. First get nxn¡1 and then n.n ¡ 1/xn¡2. Finally the nth
    derivative is n.n ¡ 1/.n ¡ 2/ : : : .1/x0; which is n factorial. When we divide by that

    number, the nth derivative of xn=nS is equal to 1:

      Now look at ex: All its derivatives are still ex: They all equal 1 at x D 0:
    The series is matching every derivative of the function ex at the starting point x D 0:

Set x D 1 in the exponential series. This tells us the amazing number e1 D e:

The number e           e  D  1  C  1  C  1  C  1  C  1   C   1   C  ¤  ¤  ¤        (2)

The first three terms add to 2.5. The first five terms almost reach 2.71. We never reach
2.72. With quite a few terms (how many ? ) you can pass 2.71828. It is certain that e
is not a fraction. It never appears in algebra, but it is the key number for calculus.

                    MULTIPLYING BY ADDING EXPONENTS

We write e2 in the same way that we write 32: Is it true that e times e equals e2 ?
Up to now, e and e2 come from setting x D 1 and x D 2 in the infinite series.

The wonderful fact is that for every x, the series produces the "xth power of the

number e:" When x D ¡1, we get e¡1 which is 1=e:

Set x D ¡1             e¡1 D 1 D 1¡1C 1 ¡ 1 C 1 ¡ 1 C¤¤¤
                       e                    2 6 24 120

If we multiply that series for 1=e by the series for e, we get 1:
  The best way is to go straight for all multiplications of ex times any power eX : The

rule of adding exponents says that the answer is exCX : The series must say this too!

When x D 1 and X D ¡1, this rule produces e0 from e1 times e¡1:

Add the exponents                     .ex/.eX / D exCX                             (3)

We only know ex and eX from the infinite series. For this all-important rule, we can
multiply those series and recognize the answer as the series for exCX : Make a start:

Multiply each term     ex D 1 C x C 1x2 C 1x3 C ¤¤¤
ex times eX                           2           6

                                                  2                    2

Certainly you see x C X: Do you see 12 .x C X /2 in equation .4/ ? No problem:

   1 .x C X /2 D 1 .x2 C 2xX C X 2/ matches the "second degree" terms.
   2                2

The step to third degree takes a little longer, but it also succeeds:

1 .x C X /3 D 1 x3 C 3 x2X C 3 xX 2 C 1 X 3 matches the next terms in (4).
6           66               6           6

For high powers of x C X we need the binomial theorem (or a healthy trust that
mathematics comes out right). When ex multiplies eX , the coefficient of xnX m
will be 1=nS times 1=mS: Now look for that same term in the series for exCX :

       .x C X /nCm     xnXm                 .n C m/S                         xnXm
       .n C m/S includes .n C m/S times nS mS which gives nS mS : (5)
18                           0 Highlights of Calculus

    That binomial number .n C m/S=nS mS is known to successful gamblers. It counts the

    number of ways to choose n aces out of n C m aces. Out of 4 aces, you could choose

    2 aces in 4S=2S2S D 6 ways. To a mathematician, there are 6 ways to choose 2 x's
    out of xxxx. This number 6 will be the coefficient of x2X 2 in .x C X /4:

      That 6 shows up in the fourth degree term. It is divided by 4! (to produce 1=4).
    When ex multiplies eX , 12 x2 multiplies 12 X 2 (which also produces 1=4). All terms
    are good, but we are not going there--we accept .ex/.eX / D exCX as now confirmed.

    Note A different way to see this rule for .ex/.eX / is based on dy=dx D y: Starting
    from y D 1 at x D 0, follow this equation. At the point x, you reach y D ex: Now go
    an additional distance X to arrive at exCX :

      Notice that the additional part starts from ex (instead of starting from 1). That
    starting value ex will multiply eX in the additional part. So ex times eX must be the
    same as exCX : (This is a "differential equations proof" that the exponents are added.

    Personally, I was happy to multiply the series and match the terms.)

      The rule immediately gives ex times ex: The answer is exCx D e2x: If we multiply
    again by ex, we find .ex/3: This is equal to e2xCx D e3x: We are finding a new rule

    for all powers .ex/n D .ex/.ex/ ¤ ¤ ¤ .ex/:

    Multiply exponents                    .ex/n D enx  (6)

    This is easy to see for n D 1; 2; 3; ::: and then n D ¡1,¡2,¡3,. . . It remains true for

    all numbers x and n.

      That last sentence about "all numbers" is important! Calculus cannot develop

    properly without working with all exponents (not just whole numbers or fractions).
    The infinite series (1) defines ex for every x and we are on our way. Here is the

                 THE EXPONENTIALS 2x AND bx

We know that 23 D 8 and 24 D 16. But what is the meaning of 2 ? One way to get
close to that number is to replace  by 3:14 which is 314=100: As long as we have a
fraction in the exponent, we can live without calculus:

     Fractional power 2314=100 D 314th power of the 100th root 21=100:

But this is only "close" to 2: And in calculus, we will want the slope of the curve
y D 2x: The good way is to connect 2x with ex; whose slope we know (it is ex again).

So we need to connect 2 with e:

  The key number is the logarithm of 2. This is written "ln 2" and it is the power
of e that produces 2: It is specially marked on the graph of ex:

Natural logarithm of 2            eln 2 D 2

This number ln 2 is about 7=10. A calculator knows it with much higher accuracy.
In the graph of y D ex, the number ln 2 on the x axis produces y D 2 on the y axis.

  This is an example where we want the output y D 2 and we ask for the input

x D ln 2: That is the opposite of knowing x and asking for y. "The logarithm
x D ln y is the inverse of the exponential y D ex:" This idea will be explained in

Section 4:3 and in two video lectures--inverse functions are not always simple.
  Now 2x has a meaning for every x: When we have the number ln 2; meeting the

requirement 2 D eln 2; we can take the xth power of both sides:

Powers of 2 from powers of e      2 D eln 2 and 2x D ex ln 2:               (7)

All powers of e are defined by the infinite series. The new function 2x also grows
exponentially, but not as fast as ex (because 2 is smaller than e). Probably y D 2x
could have the same graph as ex, if I stretched out the x axis. That stretching

multiplies the slope by the constant factor ln 2: Here is the algebra:

Slope of y D 2x      d 2x D d ex ln 2 D .ln 2/ ex ln 2 D .ln 2/2x:
                 dx           dx

For any positive number b, the same approach leads to the function y D bx.

First, find the natural logarithm ln b. This is the number (positive or negative) so
that b D eln b. Then take the xth power of both sides:

     Connect b to e b D eln b and bx D ex ln b and d bx D .ln b/bx (8)
                                                                     dx

When b is e (the perfect choice), ln b D ln e D 1: When b is en, then ln b D ln en D n:
"The logarithm is the exponent." Thanks to the series that defines ex for every x,
that exponent can be any number at all.

  Allow me to mention Euler's Great Formula eix D cos x C i sin x. The exponent

ix has become an imaginary number. (You know that i 2 D ¡1:) If we faithfully

use cos x C i sin x at 90¥ and 180¥ (where x D =2 and x D ), we arrive at these

amazing facts:

Imaginary exponents           ei=2 D i and ei D ¡1:                         (9)

Those equations are not imaginary, they come from the great series for ex:

                        CONTINUOUS COMPOUNDING OF INTEREST

    There is a different and important way to reach e and ex (not by an infinite series).

    We solve the key equation dy=dx D y in small steps. As these steps approach zero
    (a limit is always involved !) the small-step solution becomes the exact y D ex:

      I can explain this idea in two different languages. Each step multiplies by 1 C x:

    1. Compound interest. After each step x, the interest is added to y: Then the
       next step begins with a larger amount, and y increases exponentially.

    2. Finite differences. The continuous dy=dx is replaced by small steps Y =x:

              dy D y changes to Y.x C x/ ¡ Y.x/ D Y.x/ with Y.0/ D 1: (10)
              dx                                   x

          This is Euler's method of approximation. Y .x/ approaches y.x/ as x 0.

    Let me compute compound interest when 1 year is divided into 12 months, and

    then 365 days. The interest rate is 100% and you start with Y .0/ D $1: If you only

    get interest once, at the end of the year, then you have Y .1/ D $2:

    If    interest  is  added  every  month,  you   now  get  1    of  100%  each  time  (12  times).
                                                              12
                                                1                        1
    So Y  is  multiplied  each  month   by  1C  12  :  (The  bank  adds  12  for every 1 you have.)

    Do this 12 times and the final value $2 is improved to $2.61:

                                                        1 12
        After 12 months                     Y .1/ D 1 C            D $2.61
                                                             12

    Now add interest every day. Y .0/ D $1 is multiplied 365 times by 1C 365 1 :

                                             1 365
        After 365 days          Y .1/ D 1 C                   D $2.71 (close to e)
                                                   365

    Very few banks use minutes, and nobody divides the year into N D31; 536; 000
    seconds. It would add less than a penny to $2.71. But many banks are willing to
    use continuous compounding, the limit as N : After one year you have $e:

                                        1 C 1N  N

    Another limit gives e                               e D 2 :718 : : : as N                 (11)

      You could invest at the 100% rate for x years. Now each of the N steps is for
    x=N years. Again the bank multiplies at every step by 1C xN : The 1 keeps what
    you have, the x=N adds the interest in that step. After N steps you are close to ex:

    A formula for ex 1 C Nx N ex as N (12)

      Finally, I will change the interest rate to a: Go for x years at the interest rate a:

      0.4 Video Summaries and Practice Problems

This section is to help readers who also look at the Highlights of Calculus video
lectures. The first five videos are just released on ocw.mit.edu as I write these
words. Sections 0.1-0.2-0.3 discussed the content of three lectures in full detail. The
summaries and practice problems for the other two will come first in this section:

   4. Maximum and Minimum and Second Derivative

   5. Big Picture of Integrals

That Lecture 5 is a taste of Integral Calculus. A second set of video lectures goes
deeper into Differential Calculus--the rules for computing and using derivatives.

  This second set is right now with the video editors, to zoom in when I write on the
blackboard and zoom out for the big picture. I just borrowed a video camera from
MIT's OpenCourseWare and set it up in an empty room. I am not good at looking at
the audience anyway, so it was easier with nobody watching !

  I hope it will be helpful to print here the summaries and practice problems that are
planned to accompany those videos. Here are the topics:

 6. Derivative of the Sine and Cosine
 7. Product and Quotient Rules
 8. Chain Rule for the Slope of f .g.x//
 9. Inverse Functions and Logarithms
10. Growth Rates and Log Graphs
11. Linear Approximation and Newton's Method
12. Differential Equations of Growth
13. Differential Equations of Motion
14. Power Series and Euler's Formula
15. Six Functions, Six Rules, Six Theorems

That last lecture summarizes the theory of differential calculus. The other lectures
explain the steps. Here are the first lines written for the max-min video.

Maximum and Minimum and Second Derivative

Fundamental Theorem Area y.t/ has the desired derivative s.t/
Reason: y is the thin area under s.t/ between t and t C t

                 t is the base of that thin "rectangle"
                 y

                      is the height of that thin "rectangle"

If t is small, the area must be small. The wrong answer et is not small !

            0.5 Graphs and Graphing Calculators

This book started with the sentence "Calculus is about functions." When these
functions are given by formulas like y D x C x2, we now know a formula for the
slope (and even the slope of the slope). When we only have a rough graph of the
function, we can't expect more than a rough graph of the slope. But graphs are very
valuable in applications of calculus!

  From a graph of y.x/, this section extracts the basic information about the growth
rate (the slope) and the minimum=maximum and the bending (and area too). A
big part of that information is contained in a plus or minus sign. Is y.x/ increasing ?
Is its slope increasing ? Is the area under its graph increasing ? In each case some
number is greater than zero. The three numbers are dy=dx and d 2y=dx2 and y.x/
itself.

  When one of those numbers is exactly zero we always have a special situation. It is
a good thing that mathematics invented zero, we need it.

  This section is organized by two themes:

  (1) Graphs that are drawn without a formula for y.x/. From that graph you can
       draw other graphs--the slope dy=dx, the second derivative d 2y=dx2, the area
       A.x/ under the graph.

          You can also identify where those functions are positive or negative--and
       especially the points where dy=dx or d 2y=dx2 or y.x/ is zero.

  (2) Graphs that are drawn by a calculator or computer. Now there is a formula for
       y.x/. The display allows us to guess rules for derivatives:

                       Chain Rule Inverse Rule l'Hôpital's Rule

       These rules come into later chapters of the book. They are also explained in
       Highlights of Calculus, the video lectures that are available to everyone. One
       specific goal is to see how the derivative of 2x is proportional to 2x.

This section was much improved by ideas that were offered by Benjamin Goldstein.

4. Conjecture: If k is some constant, then the derivative of sin .kx/ is  :

b. Those functions are chains (also called compositions). They can be written in the

form Y D f .g.x//: For sin .kx/ the outer function is f .x/ D  and the inner

function is g.x/ D  :

c. So far the inner function g.x/ has been linear, but it doesn't have to be. Let
   Y D sin . x/:

Conjecture: d Y D      when g.x/ D x:

                                   COMPUTING IN CALCULUS

Software is available for calculus courses--a lot of it. The packages keep getting
better. Which program to use (if any) depends on cost and convenience and purpose.
How to use it is a much harder question. These pages identify some of the goals. Our
aim is to support, with examples, the effort to use computing to help learning.

  For calculus, the greatest advantage of the computer is to offer graphics. You
see the function, not just the formula. As you watch, f .x/ reaches a maximum or
a minimum or zero. A separate graph shows its derivative. Those statements are not
100% true, as everybody learns right away--as soon as a few functions are typed in.
But the power to see this subject is enormous, because it is adjustable. If we don't like
the picture we change to a new viewing window.

  This is computer-based graphics. It combines numerical computation with graph-
ical computation. You get pictures as well as numbers--a powerful combination. The
computer offers the experience of actually working with a function. The domain and
range are not just abstract ideas. You choose them. May I give a few examples.

    EXAMPLE 1 Certainlyx3 equals 3x when x D3.Do those graphs ever meet again ?
    At this point we don't know the full meaning of 3x, except when x is a nice number.
    (Neither does the computer.) Checking at x D2 and 4, the function x3 is smaller both
    times: 23 is below 32 and 43 D64 is below 34D81. If x3 is always less than 3x we
    ought to know--these are among the basic functions of mathematics.

      The computer will answer numerically or graphically. At our command, it solves
    x3 D3x. At another command, it plots both functions--this shows more. The screen
    proves a point of logic (or mathematics) that escaped us. If the graphs cross once, they
    must cross again--because 3x is higher at 2 and 4. A crossing point near 2:5 is seen
    by zooming in. I am less interested in the exact number than its position--it comes
    before x D3 rather than after.

      A few conclusions from such a basic example:

       1. A supercomputer is not necessary.

       2. High-level programming is not necessary.

       3. We can do mathematics without completely understanding it.

    The third point doesn't sound so good.Write it differently:We can learn mathematics
    while doing it. The hardest part of teaching calculus is to turn it from a spectator
    sport into a workout. The computer makes that possible.

    EXAMPLE 2 (mental computer) Compare x2 with 2x. The functions meet at x D2.
    Where do they meet again ? Is it before or after 2 ?

    That is mental computing because the answer happens to be a whole number (4). Now
    we are on a different track. Does an accident like 24D42 ever happen again ? Can the
    machine tell us about integers ? Perhaps it can plot the solutions of xb Dbx. I asked
    Mathematica for a formula, hoping to discover x as a function of b--but the program
    just gave back the equation. For once the machine typed HELP instead of the user.

      Well, mathematics is not helpless. I am proud of calculus. There is a new exercise
    at the end of Section 6:4, to show that we never see whole numbers again.

    EXAMPLE 3 Find the number b for which xb Dbx has only one solution (at x Db).

    When b is 3, the second solution is below 3. When b is 2, the second solution .4/ is
    above 2. If we move b from 2 to 3, there must be a special "double point"--where
    the graphs barely touch but don't cross. For that particular b--and only for that one
    value--the curve xb never goes above bx.

      This special point b can be found with computer-based graphics. In many ways
    it is the "center point of calculus." Since the curves touch but don't cross, they are
    tangent. They have the same slope at the double point. Calculus was created to work
    with slopes, and we already know the slope of x2. Soon comes xb. Eventually we
    discover the slope of bx, and identify the most important number in calculus.

      The point is that this number can be discovered first by experiment.

    EXAMPLE 4 Graph y.x/ D ex ¡ xe. Locate its minimum. Zoom in near x D e:

    From the derivatives of ex and xe; show that dy=dx D 0 at x D e:
      If you try, you can also find the next derivative d 2y=dx2: Can you see why

    d 2y=dx2 0 at x D e ?

 The next example was proposed by Don Small. Solve x4 ¡ 11x3 C 5x ¡ 2 D 0. The

first tool is algebra--try to factor the polynomial. That succeeds for quadratics, and
then gets extremely hard. Even if the computer can do algebra better than we can,
factoring is seldom the way to go. In reality we have two good choices:

   1. (Mathematics) Use the derivative. Solve by Newton's method.
   2. (Graphics) Plot the function and zoom in.

Both will be done by the computer. Both have potential problems! Newton's method
is fast, but that means it can fail fast. (It is usually terrific.) Plotting the graph is also
fast--but solutions can be outside the viewing window. This particular function is zero

only once, in the standard window from ¡10 to 10. The graph seems to be leaving

zero, but mathematics again predicts a second crossing point. So we zoom out before
we zoom in.

  The use of the zoom is the best part of graphing. Not only do we choose the domain
and range, we change them. The viewing window is controlled by four numbers.
They can be the limits A x B and C y D. They can be the coordinates of two
opposite corners: .A; C / and .B; D/. They can be the center position .a; b/ and the
scale factors c and d . Clicking on opposite corners of the zoom box is the fastest
way, unless the center is unchanged and we only need to give scale factors. (Even
faster: Use the default factors.) Section 3:4 discusses the centering transform and
zoom transform--a change of picture on the screen and a change of variable within
the function.

EXAMPLE 5 Find all real solutions to x4 ¡ 11x3 C 5x ¡ 2D0:

EXAMPLE 6 Zoom out and in on the graphs of y D cos 40x and y D x sin.1=x/.
Describe what you see.

EXAMPLE 7 What does y D.tan x ¡ sin x/=x3 approach at x D0 ? For small x

the machine eventually can't separate tan x from sin x. It may give y D0. Can you
get close enough to see the limit of y as x 0 ?

                                    SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION

In symbolic computation, answers can be formulas as well as numbers and graphs.
The derivative of y Dx2 is seen as "2x." The derivative of sin t is "cos t." The slope
of bx is known to the program. The computer does more than substitute numbers into
formulas--it operates directly on the formulas. We need to think where this fits with
learning calculus.

  In a way, symbolic computing is close to what we ourselves do. Maybe too close--
there is some danger that symbolic manipulation is all we do. With a higher-level
language and enough power, a computer can print the derivative of sin.x2/. So why
learn the chain rule ? Because mathematics goes deeper than "algebra with formulas."
We deal with ideas.

  I want to say clearly:Mathematics is not formulas or computations or even proofs,
but ideas. The symbols and pictures are the language. The book and the professor and
the computer can join in teaching it. The computer should be non-threatening (like
this book and your professor)--you can work at your own pace. Your part is to learn
by doing.

    EXAMPLE 8 A computer algebra system quickly finds 100 factorial. This is
    100SD.100/.99/.98/ : : :.1/. The number has 158 digits (not written out here). The
    last 24 digits are zeros. For 10SD3628800 there are seven digits and two zeros.
    Between 10 and 100, and beyond, are simple questions that need ideas:

       1. How many digits (approximately) are in the number N S ?
       2. How many zeros (exactly) are at the end of N S ?

    For Question 1, the computer shows more than N digits when N D100. It will
    never show more than N 2 digits, because none of the N terms can have more than
    N digits. A much tighter bound would be 2N , but is it true ? Does N S always have
    fewer than 2N digits ?

      For Question 2, the zeros in 10S can be explained. One comes from 10, the other
    from 5 times 2. .10 is also 5 times 2:/ Can you explain the 24 zeros in 100S ? An idea
    from the card game blackjack applies here too: Count the fives.

      Hard question: How many zeros at the end of 200S ?

    Writing in Calculus May I emphasize the importance of writing ? We totally miss
    it, when the answer is just a number. A one-page report is harder on instructors as
    well as students--but much more valuable. You can't write sentences without being
    forced to organize ideas--and part of yourself goes into it.

      I will propose a writing exercise with options. If you have computer-based

    graphing, follow through on Examples 1 ¡ 4 above and report. Without a computer,

    pick a paragraph from this book that should be clearer and make it clearer. Rewrite it
    with examples. Identify the key idea at the start, explain it, and come back to express
    it differently at the end. Ideas are like surfaces--they can be seen many ways.

      Mathematics can be learned by talking and writing--it is a human activity. Our
    goal is not to test but to teach and learn.
                              CHAPTER 1

     Introduction to Calculus

                    1.1 Velocity and Distance

The right way to begin a calculus book is with calculus. This chapter will jump
directly into the two problems that the subject was invented to solve. You will see
what the questions are, and you will see an important part of the answer. There are
plenty of good things left for the other chapters, so why not get started ?

  The book begins with an example that is familiar to everybody who drives a car. It is
calculus in action--the driver sees it happening. The example is the relation between
the speedometer and the odometer. One measures the speed (or velocity); the other
measures the distance traveled. We will write v for the velocity, and f for how far
the car has gone. The two instruments sit together on the dashboard:

                 Fig. 1.1 Velocity v and total distance f (at one instant of time).
  Notice that the units of measurement are different for v and f: The distance f is
measured in kilometers or miles (it is easier to say miles). The velocity v is measured
in km=hr or miles per hour. A unit of time enters the velocity but not the distance.
Every formula to compute v from f will have f divided by time.

        The central question of calculus is the relation between v and f:

                                                                                        51
52  1 Introduction to Calculus

    Can you find v if you know f; and vice versa, and how ? If we know the velocity over
    the whole history of the car, we should be able to compute the total distance traveled.
    In other words, if the speedometer record is complete but the odometer is missing,
    its information could be recovered. One way to do it (without calculus) is to put in
    a new odometer and drive the car all over again at the right speeds. That seems like
    a hard way; calculus may be easier. But the point is that the information is there.
    If we know everything about v; there must be a method to find f:

      What happens in the opposite direction, when f is known ? If you have a complete
    record of distance, could you recover the complete velocity ? In principle you could
    drive the car, repeat the history, and read off the speed. Again there must be a better
    way.

      The whole subject of calculus is built on the relation between v and f: The question
    we are raising here is not some kind of joke, after which the book will get serious
    and the mathematics will get started. On the contrary, I am serious now--and the
    mathematics has already started. We need to know how to find the velocity from a
    record of the distance. (That is called differentiation, and it is the central idea of
    differential calculus.) We also want to compute the distance from a history of the
    velocity. (That is integration, and it is the goal of integral calculus.)

      Differentiation goes from f to v; integration goes from v to f: We look first at
    examples in which these pairs can be computed and understood.

                                           CONSTANT VELOCITY

    Suppose the velocity is fixed at v D 60 (miles per hour). Then f increases at this
    constant rate. After two hours the distance is f D 120 (miles). After four hours
    f D 240 and after t hours f D 60t: We say that f increases linearly with time--
    its graph is a straight line.

              Fig. 1.2 Constant velocity v D 60 and linearly increasing distance f D 60t:

      Notice that this example starts the car at full velocity. No time is spent picking up
    speed. (The velocity is a "step function.") Notice also that the distance starts at zero;
    the car is new. Those decisions make the graphs of v and f as neat as possible. One is
    the horizontal line v D 60: The other is the sloping line f D 60t: This v, f; t relation
    needs algebra but not calculus:

                      If v is constant and f starts at zero then f D vt:

    The opposite is also true. When f increases linearly, v is constant. The division by
    time gives the slope. The distance is f1 D 120 miles when the time is t1 D 2 hours.
    Later f2 D 240 miles at t2 D 4 hours. At both points, the ratio f =t is 60 miles=hour.
    Geometrically, the velocity is the slope of the distance graph:

                                slope D change in distance D vt D v:
                                            change in time t
1.1 Velocity and Distance                                                                       53

      Fig. 1.3 Straight lines f D 20 C60t (slope 60) and f D ¡30t (slope ¡30).

The slope of the f -graph gives the v-graph. Figure 1.3 shows two more possibilities:

    1. The distance starts at 20 instead of 0: The distance formula changes from 60t
       to 20 C 60t: The number 20 cancels when we compute change in distance--so
       the slope is still 60:

    2. When v is negative, the graph of f goes downward. The car goes backward

     and the slope of f D ¡30t is v D ¡30:

I don't think speedometers go below zero. But driving backwards, it's not that safe
to watch. If you go fast enough, Toyota says they measure "absolute values"--the

speedometer reads C30 when the velocity is ¡30: For the odometer, as far as I know

it just stops. It should go backward.

                        VELOCITY vs. DISTANCE: SLOPE vs. AREA

How do you compute f from v ? The point of the question is to see f D vt on the
graphs. We want to start with the graph of v and discover the graph of f: Amazingly,
the opposite of slope is area.

   The distance f is the area under the v-graph. When v is constant, the region
under the graph is a rectangle. Its height is v, its width is t, and its area is v times t:
This is integration, to go from v to f by computing the area. We are glimpsing two
of the central facts of calculus.

  1A The slope of the f-graph gives the velocity v. The area under the v-graph
  gives the distance f.

That is certainly not obvious, and I hesitated a long time before I wrote it down in
this first section. The best way to understand it is to look first at more examples. The
whole point of calculus is to deal with velocities that are not constant, and from now
on v has several values.

EXAMPLE (Forward and back) There is a motion that you will understand right
away. The car goes forward with velocity V; and comes back at the same speed. To

say it more correctly, the velocity in the second part is ¡V: If the forward part lasts

until t D 3, and the backward part continues to t D 6, the car will come back where it
started. The total distance after both parts will be f D 0:

 This actually happened in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, when the hero borrowed his father's
sports car and ran up the mileage. At home he raised the car and drove in reverse. I forget if
it worked.
54  1 Introduction to Calculus

      Fig. 1.4 Velocities CV and ¡V gives motion forward and back, ending at f .6/ D 0:

     The v-graph shows velocities CV and ¡V: The distance starts up with slope CV

    and reaches f D 3V: Then the car starts backward. The distance goes down with

    slope ¡V and returns to f D 0 at t D 6:

      Notice what that means. The total area "under" the v-graph is zero! A negative
    velocity makes the distance graph go downward (negative slope). The car is moving
    backward. Area below the axis in the v-graph is counted as negative.

                                                   FUNCTIONS
    This forward-back example gives practice with a crucially important idea--the
    concept of a "function." We seize this golden opportunity to explain functions:

               The number v.t/ is the value of the function v at the time t.

    The time t is the input to the function. The velocity v.t/ at that time is the output.
    Most people say "v of t" when they read v.t/: The number "v of 2" is the velocity

    when t D 2: The forward-back example has v.2/ D CV and v.4/ D ¡V: The func-

    tion contains the whole history, like a memory bank that has a record of v at each t:
      It is simple to convert forward-back motion into a formula. Here is v.t/:

                                °
                                ³² CV if 0 t 3

                       v.t/ D ³± < if t D 3 ¡V if 3 t 6

    The right side contains the instructions for finding v.t/: The input t is converted into

    the output CV or ¡V: The velocity v.t/ depends on t: In this case the function is

    "discontinuous," because the needle jumps at t D 3: The velocity is not defined at that
    instant. There is no v.3/: (You might argue that v is zero at the jump, but that leads
    to trouble.) The graph of f has a corner, and we can't give its slope.

      The problem also involves a second function, namely the distance. The principle
    behind f .t/ is the same: f .t/ is the distance at time t: It is the net distance forward,
    and again the instructions change at t D 3: In the forward motion, f .t/ equals V t as
    before. In the backward half, a calculation is built into the formula for f .t/:

    f .t/ D  Vt  if 0 t 3

             V .6 ¡ t/ if 3 t 6

    At the switching time the right side gives two instructions (one on each line). This
    would be bad except that they agree: f .3/ D 3V: The distance function is "continu-
    ous." There is no jump in f; even when there is a jump in v: After t D 3 the distance

    decreases because of ¡V t: At t D 6 the second instruction correctly gives f .6/ D 0:

     A function is only allowed one value f .t / or v.t / at each time t:

  Notice something more. The functions were given by graphs before they were given
by formulas. The graphs tell you f and v at every time t--sometimes more clearly
than the formulas. The values f .t/ and v.t/ can also be given by tables or equations
or a set of instructions. (In some way all functions are instructions--the function tells
how to find f at time t:) Part of knowing f is knowing all its inputs and outputs--its
domain and range:

 The domain of a function is the set of inputs. The range is the set of outputs.

The domain of f consists of all times 0 t 6: The range consists of all distances

0 f .t/ 3V: (The range of v contains only the two velocities CV and ¡V:)

We mention now, and repeat later, that every "linear" function has a formula
f .t/ D vt C C: Its graph is a line and v is the slope. The constant C moves the line
up and down. It adjusts the line to go through any desired starting point.

               SUMMARY: MORE ABOUT FUNCTIONS

May I collect together the ideas brought out by this example ? We had two functions

v and f: One was velocity, the other was distance. Each function had a domain, and

a range, and most important a graph. For the f -graph we studied the slope (which

agreed with v). For the v-graph we studied the area (which agreed with f ). Calculus

produces functions in pairs, and the best thing a book can do early is to show you

more of them.

Note about the definition of a function. The idea behind the symbol f .t/ is
absolutely crucial to mathematics. Words don't do it justice! By definition, a function
is a "rule" that assigns one member of the range to each member of the domain. Or,
a function is a set of pairs .t; f .t// with no t appearing twice. (These are "ordered
pairs" because we write t before f .t/:) Both of those definitions are correct--but
somehow they are too passive.

  In practice what matters is the active part. The number f .t/ is produced from the
number t: We read a graph, plug into a formula, solve an equation, run a computer
program. The input t is "mapped" to the output f .t/, which changes as t changes.
Calculus is about the rate of change. This rate is our other function v:

Fig. 1.5 Subtracting 2 from f affects the range. Subtracting 2 from t affects the domain.
56  1 Introduction to Calculus

      It is quite hard at the beginning, and not automatic, to see the difference between

    f .t/ ¡ 2 and f .t ¡ 2/: Those are both new functions, created out of the original f .t/:
    In f .t/ ¡ 2, we subtract 2 from all the distances. That moves the whole graph down.
    In f .t ¡ 2/, we subtract 2 from the time. That moves the graph over to the right.

    Figure 1.5 shows both movements, starting from f .t/ D 2t C 1: The formula to find

    f .t ¡ 2/ is 2.t ¡ 2/ C1, which is 2t ¡ 3:

      A graphing calculator also moves the graph, when you change the viewing window.
    You can pick any rectangle A t B; C f .t/ D: The screen shows that part of
    the graph. But on the calculator, the function f .t/ remains the same. It is the axes that
    get renumbered. In our figures the axes stay the same and the function is changed.

      There are two more basic ways to change a function. (We are always creating new
    functions--that is what mathematics is all about.) Instead of subtracting or adding,
    we can multiply the distance by 2: Figure 1.6 shows 2f .t/: And instead of shifting
    the time, we can speed it up. The function becomes f .2t/: Everything happens twice
    as fast (and takes half as long). On the calculator those changes correspond to a "zoom"
    --on the f axis or the t axis. We soon come back to zooms.

    Fig. 1.6 Doubling the distance or speeding up the time doubles the slope.

           1.2 Calculus Without Limits

The next page is going to reveal one of the key ideas behind calculus. The discussion is
just about numbers--functions and slopes can wait. The numbers are not even special,
they can be any numbers. The crucial point is to look at their differences:

           Suppose the numbers are f D 0 2 6 7 4 9
                                      2 4 1 ¡3 5
           Their differences are v D

The differences are printed in between, to show 2 ¡ 0 D 2 and 6 ¡ 2 D 4 and
7 ¡ 6 D 1: Notice how 4 ¡ 7 gives a negative answer ¡3: The numbers in f can go

up or down, the differences in v can be positive or negative. The idea behind calculus

comes when you add up those differences:

                            2C4C1¡3C5D9

The sum of differences is 9: This is the last number on the top line (in f ). Is this an
accident, or is this always true ? If we stop earlier, after 2 C 4 C 1, we get the 7 in f:
Test any prediction on a second example:

           Suppose the numbers are f D 1 3 7 8 5 10
                                      2 4 1 ¡3 5
           Their differences are v D

The f 's are increased by 1: The differences are exactly the same--no change. The

sum of differences is still 9: But the last f is now 10: That prediction is not right, we

don't always get the last f:

 The first f is now 1: The answer 9 (the sum of differences) is 10 ¡ 1, the last f

minus the first f: What happens when we change the f 's in the middle ?

           Suppose the numbers are f D 1 5 12 7 10
                                         4 7 ¡5 3
           Their differences are v D

The differences add to 4 C 7 ¡ 5 C 3 D 9: This is still 10 ¡ 1: No matter what f 's we

choose or how many, the sum of differences is controlled by the first f and last f:

If this is always true, there must be a clear reason why the middle f's cancel out.

The sum of differences is .5 ¡ 1/ C.12 ¡ 5/ C.7 ¡ 12/ C.10 ¡ 7/ D 10 ¡ 1:

The 5's cancel, the 12's cancel, and the 7's cancel. It is only 10 ¡ 1 that doesn't cancel.

This is the key to calculus!

1B The differences of the f 's add up to (flast ¡ ffirst).

EXAMPLE 1  The numbers grow linearly: f D 2 3 4 5 6 7
           Their differences are constant: v D 1 1 1 1 1

The sum of differences is certainly 5: This agrees with 7 ¡ 2 D flast ¡ ffirst: The

numbers in v remind us of constant velocity. The numbers in f remind us of a straight

line f D vt C C: This example has v D 1 and the f 's start at 2: The straight line

would come from f D t C 2:

EXAMPLE 2  The numbers are squares: f D  0 1 4 9 16

           Their differences grow linearly: v D 1 3 5 7

1 C 3 C 5 C 7 agrees with 42 D 16: It is a beautiful fact that the first j odd numbers
always add up to j 2: The v's are the odd numbers, the f 's are perfect squares.
60                                      1 Introduction to Calculus

    Note The letter j is sometimes useful to tell which number in f we are looking at.
    For this example the zeroth number is f0 D 0 and the j th number is fj D j 2: This is a

    part of algebra, to give a formula for the f 's instead of a list of numbers. We can also

    use j to tell which difference we are looking at. The first v is the first odd number

    v1 D 1: The j th difference is the j th odd number vj D 2j ¡ 1: (Thus v4 is 8 ¡ 1 D 7:)

    It is better to start the differences with j D 1, since there is no zeroth odd number v0:

     With this notation the j th difference is vj D fj ¡ fj ¡1: Sooner or later you will
    get comfortable with subscripts like j and j ¡ 1, but it can be later. The important
    point is that the sum of the v's equals flast ¡ ffirst: We now connect the v's to slopes

    and the f 's to areas.

          Fig. 1.7 Linear increase in v D 1; 3; 5; 7: Squares in the distances f D 0; 1; 4; 9; 16:

    Figure 1.7 shows a natural way to graph Example 2, with the odd numbers in v and
    the squares in f: Notice an important difference between the v-graph and the f-graph.
    The graph of f is "piecewise linear." We plotted the numbers in f and connected them
    by straight lines. The graph of v is "piecewise constant." We plotted the differences
    as constant over each piece. This reminds us of the distance-velocity graphs, when
    the distance f .t/ is a straight line and the velocity v.t/ is a horizontal line.

      Now make the connection to slopes:

                The slope of the f -graph is distance up D change in f D v:
                                                  distance across change in t

    Over each piece, the change in t (across) is 1: The change in f (upward) is the
    difference that we are calling v: The ratio is the slope v=1 or just v: The slope makes
    a sudden change at the breakpoints t D 1; 2; 3; : : :. At those special points the slope
    of the f -graph is not defined--we connected the v's by vertical lines but this is very
    debatable. The main idea is that between the breakpoints, the slope of f .t/ is v.t/.

      Now make the connection to areas:

                  The total area under the v-graph is flast ¡ ffirst:

    This area, underneath the staircase in Figure 1.7, is composed of rectangles. The base

    of every rectangle is 1: The heights of the rectangles are the v's. So the areas also

    equal the v's, and the total area is the sum of the v's. This area is flast ¡ ffirst:

       Even more is true. We could start at any time and end at any later time--

    not necessarily at the special times t D 0; 1; 2; 3; 4: Suppose we stop at t D 3:5: Only

    half of the last rectangular area (under v D 7) will be counted. The total area is
                                                                   flast ¡ ffirst D 12:5 ¡ 0:
    1  C  3  C  5  C  1  .7/  D  12:5:  This  still  agrees  with                              At   this
                      2
    new ending time t D 3:5, we are only halfway up the last step in the f -graph. Halfway

    between 9 and 16 is 12:5:
                                1.2 Calculus Without Limits                                                61

1C The v's are slopes of f .t/: The area under the v-graph is f .tend/ ¡ f .tstart/:

This is nothing less than the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. But we have only
used algebra (no curved graphs and no calculations involving limits). For now the
Theorem is restricted to piecewise linear f .t/ and piecewise constant v.t/: In
Chapter 5 that restriction will be overcome.

Notice that a proof of 1 C 3 C 5 C 7 D 42 is suggested by Figure 1.7a. The triangle

under the dotted line has the same area as the four rectangles under the staircase. The
                                ¤base ¤height D      ¤ 4 ¤ 8,
area  of  the  triangle  is  1                    1       ¤j   which  is  the  perfect  square  42:  When
                             2                    2            ¤ 2j
                                                       1             Dj2
there  are  j  rectangles    instead  of  4,  we  get  2                  for  the  area.

The next examples show other patterns, where f and v increase exponentially or

oscillate around zero. I hope you like them but I don't think you have to learn them.
They are like the special functions 2t and sin t and cos t--except they go in steps.

You get a first look at the important functions of calculus, but you only need algebra.

Calculus is needed for a steadily changing velocity, when the graph of f is curved.

  The last example will be income tax--which really does go in steps. Then
Section 1:3 will introduce the slope of a curve. The crucial step for curves is working
with limits. That will take us from algebra to calculus.

                         EXPONENTIAL VELOCITY AND DISTANCE

Start with the numbers f D 1; 2; 4; 8; 16: These are "powers of 2:" They start with the
zeroth power, which is 20 D 1: The exponential starts at 1 and not 0. After j steps
there are j factors of 2, and fj equals 2j : Please recognize the difference between
2j and j 2 and 2j . The numbers 2j grow linearly, the numbers j 2 grow quadratically,
the numbers 2j grow exponentially. At j D 10 these are 20 and 100 and 1024: The
exponential 2j quickly becomes much larger than the others.

  The differences of f D 1; 2; 4; 8; 16 are exactly v D 1; 2; 4; 8: We get the same
beautiful numbers. When the f 's are powers of 2; so are the v's. The formula

vj D 2j ¡1 is slightly different from fj D 2j , because the first v is numbered v1: (Then

v1 D 20 D 1: The zeroth power of every number is 1, except that 00 is meaningless.)
The two graphs in Figure 1.8 use the same numbers but they look different, because
f is piecewise linear and v is piecewise constant.

              Fig. 1.8 The velocity and distance grow exponentially (powers of 2).

  Where will calculus come in ? It works with the smooth curve f .t/ D 2t : This
exponential growth is critically important for population and money in a bank and the
national debt. You can spot it by the following test: v.t/ is proportional to f .t/:
62          1 Introduction to Calculus

    Remark The function 2t is trickier than t2: For f D t2 the slope is v D 2t: It is
    proportional to t and not t2: For f D 2t the slope is v D c2t , and we won't find the

    constant c D :693 : : : until Chapter 6: (The number c is the natural logarithm of 2:)

    Problem 37 estimates c with a calculator--the important thing is that it's constant.

            OSCILLATING VELOCITY AND DISTANCE

    We have seen a forward-back motion, velocity V followed by ¡V: That is oscillation

    of the simplest kind. The graph of f goes linearly up and linearly down. Figure 1.9

    shows another oscillation that returns to zero, but the path is more interesting.

     The numbers in f are now 0; 1; 1; 0; ¡1; ¡1; 0: Since f6 D 0 the motion brings us

    back to the start. The whole oscillation can be repeated.

     The differences in v are 1; 0; ¡1; ¡1; 0; 1: They add up to zero, which agrees with
    flast ¡ ffirst: It is the same oscillation as in f (and also repeatable), but shifted in time.

    The f -graph resembles (roughly) a sine curve. The v-graph resembles (even more

    roughly) a cosine curve. The waveforms in nature are smooth curves, while these are

    "digitized"--the way a digital watch goes forward in jumps. You recognize that the

    change from analog to digital brought the computer revolution. The same revolution

    is coming in CD players. Digital signals (off or on, 0 or 1) seem to win every time.

    The piecewise v and f start again at t D 6: The ordinary sine and cosine repeat at

    t D 2: A repeating motion is periodic--here the "period" is 6 or 2: (With t in

    degrees the period is 360--a full circle. The period becomes 2 when angles are mea-

    sured in radians. We virtually always use radians--which are degrees times 2=360:)

    A watch has a period of 12 hours. If the dial shows AM and PM, the period is          :

    Fig. 1.9 Piecewise constant "cosine" and piecewise linear "sine." They both repeat.

                                       A SHORT BURST OF SPEED

    The next example is a car that is driven fast for a short time. The speed is V until the
    distance reaches f D 1, when the car suddenly stops. The graph of f goes up linearly
    with slope V , and then across with slope zero:

    v.t/ D  V up to t D T  f .t/ D  V t up to t D T
            0 after t D T           1 after t D T

    This is another example of "function notation." Notice the general time t and the
    particular stopping time T: The distance is f .t/: The domain of f (the inputs)
    includes all times t 0: The range of f (the outputs) includes all distances 0 f 1:

      Figure 1.10 allows us to compare three cars--a Jeep and a Corvette and a Maserati.
    They have different speeds but they all reach f D 1: So the areas under the v-graphs
    are all 1: The rectangles have height V and base T D 1=V:
1.2 Calculus Without Limits                                                                 63

Fig. 1.10 Bursts of speed with VM TM D VC TC D VJ TJ D 1: Step function has infinite
              slope.

Optional remark It is natural to think about faster and faster speeds, which means
steeper slopes. The f -graph reaches 1 in shorter times. The extreme case is a step
function, when the graph of f goes straight up. This is the unit step U.t/, which is
zero up to t D 0 and jumps immediately to U D 1 for t 0:

What is the slope of the step function ? It is zero except at the jump. At that moment,
which is t D 0, the slope is infinite. We don't have an ordinary velocity v.t/--instead
we have an impulse that makes the car jump. The graph is a spike over the single point
t D 0, and it is often denoted by i--so the slope of the step function is called a "delta
function." The area under the infinite spike is 1:

  You are absolutely not responsible for the theory of delta functions! Calculus is
about curves, not jumps.

  Our last example is a real-world application of slopes ands rates--to explain "how
taxes work." Note especially the difference between tax rates and tax brackets and
total tax. The rates are v, the brackets are on x, the total tax is f:

EXAMPLE 3 Income tax is piecewise linear. The slopes are the tax rates :15; :28; :31:

Suppose you are single with taxable income of x dollars (Form 1040; line 37--after
all deductions). These are the 1991 instructions from the Internal Revenue Service:

 If x is not over $20; 350; the tax is 15% of x:

 If $20; 350 x $49; 300; the tax is $3052:50 C 28% of the amount over $20; 350:

 If x is over $49; 300; the tax is $11; 158:50 C 31% of the amount over $49; 300:

The first bracket is 0 x $20; 350: (The IRS never uses this symbol , but I think
it is OK here.We know what it means.)Thesecond bracket is $20; 350 x $49; 300:
The top bracket x $49; 300 pays tax at the top rate of 31%: But only the income in
that bracket is taxed at that rate.

  Figure 1.11 shows the rates and the brackets and the tax due. Those are not average
rates, they are marginal rates. Total tax divided by total income would be the average
rate. The marginal rate of .28 or :31 gives the tax on each additional dollar of income--
it is the slope at the point x: Tax is like area or distance--it adds up. Tax rate is like
slope or velocity--it depends where you are. This is often unclear in the news media.

Question What is the equation for the straight line in the top bracket ?
Answer The bracket begins at x D $49; 300 when the tax is f .x/ D $11; 158:50:
The slope of the line is the tax rate :31: When we know a point on the line and the
slope, we know the equation. This is important enough to be highlighted.
64                      1 Introduction to Calculus

             Fig. 1.11 The tax rate is v, the total tax is f: Tax brackets end at breakpoints.

     1D For x in the top bracket the tax is f .x/ D $11; 158:50 C :31.x ¡ $49; 300/:

      This is the tax on $49; 300 plus the extra tax on extra income.

    Section 2:3 presents this "point-slope equation" for any straight line. Here you see it
    for one specific example. Where does the number $11; 158:50 come from ? It is the
    tax at the end of the middle bracket, so it is the tax at the start of the top bracket.

      Figure 1.11 also shows a distance-velocity example. The distance at t D 2 is
    f .2/ D 40 miles. After that time the velocity is 60 miles per hour. So the line with
    slope 60 on the f -graph has the equation

             f .t/ D starting distance C extra distance D 40 C 60.t ¡ 2/:
    The starting point is .2; 40/: The new speed 60 multiplies the extra time t ¡ 2: The

    point-slope equation makes sense. We now review this section, with comments.
    Central idea Start with any numbers in f: Their differences go in v: Then the sum of

    those differences is flast ¡ ffirst:

    Subscript notation The numbers are f0; f1; : : : and the first difference is

    v1 D f1 ¡ f0: A typical number is fj and the j th difference is vj D fj ¡ fj ¡1: When

    those differences are added, all f 's in the middle (like f1) cancel out:

     v1 Cv2 C¤ ¤ ¤ Cvj D .f 1 ¡ f 0/ C.f 2 ¡ f 1/ C¤ ¤ ¤ C.f j ¡ f j ¡1/ D f j ¡ f 0:

    Examples fj D j or j 2 or 2j : Then vj D 1 (constant) or 2j ¡ 1 (odd numbers)

    or 2j ¡1:

    Functions Connect the f 's to be piecewise linear. Then the slope v is piecewise con-

    stant. The area under the v-graph from any tstart to any tend equals f .tend/ ¡ f .tstart/:

    Units Distance in miles and velocity in miles per hour. Tax in dollars and tax rate in
    (dollars paid)=(dollars earned). Tax rate is a percentage like :28, with no units.

                  1.3 The Velocity at an Instant

We have arrived at the central problems that calculus was invented to solve. There are
two questions, in opposite directions, and I hope you could see them coming.

   1. If the velocity is changing, how can you compute the distance traveled ?
   2. If the graph of f .t/ is not a straight line, what is its slope ?

Find the distance from the velocity, find the velocity from the distance. Our goal is to
do both--but not in one section. Calculus may be a good course, but it is not magic.
The first step is to let the velocity change in the steadiest possible way.

Question 1 Suppose the velocity at each time t is v.t/ D 2t: Find f .t/:

With v D 2t, a physicist would say that the acceleration is constant (it equals 2). The
driver steps on the gas, the car accelerates, and the speedometer goes steadily up. The
distance goes up too--faster and faster. If we measure t in seconds and v in feet per
second, the distance f comes out in feet. After 10 seconds the speed is 20 feet per
second. After 44 seconds the speed is 88 feet=second (which is 60 miles=hour). The
acceleration is clear, but how far has the car gone ?

Question 2 The distance traveled by time t is f .t/ D t2: Find the velocity v.t/:

The graph of f .t/ D t2 is on the right of Figure 1.12. It is a parabola. The curve
starts at zero, when the car is new. At t D 5 the distance is f D 25: By t D 10; f
reaches 100:

  Velocity is distance divided by time, but what happens when the speed is changing ?
Dividing f D 100 by t D 10 gives v D 10--the average velocity over the first ten
seconds. Dividing f D 121 by t D 11 gives the average speed over 11 seconds. But
how do we find the instantaneous velocity--the reading on the speedometer at the
exact instant when t D 10 ?

           Fig. 1.12 The velocity v D 2t is linear. The distance f D t2 is quadratic.

  I hope you see the problem. As the car goes faster, the graph of t2 gets steeper--
because more distance is covered in each second. The average velocity between t D 10
and t D 11 is a good approximation--but only an approximation--to the speed at the
moment t D 10: Averages are easy to find:
68               1 Introduction to Calculus

    distance at t D 10 is f .10/ D 102 D 100 distance at t D 11 is f .11/ D 112 D 121

    average velocity is f .11/ ¡ f .10/ D 121 ¡ 100 D 21:
                    11 ¡ 10     1

    The car covered 21 feet in that 1 second. Its average speed was 21 feet=second. Since
    it was gaining speed, the velocity at the beginning of that second was below 21:

      Geometrically, what is the average ? It is a slope, but not the slope of the curve.
    The average velocity is the slope of a straight line. The line goes between two points
    on the curve in Figure 1.12. When we compute an average, we pretend the velocity is
    constant--so we go back to the easiest case. It only requires a division of distance by
    time:

                                   average velocity D change in f : (1)
                                                           change in t

    Calculus and the Law You enter a highway at 1 W 00: If you exit 150 miles away at
    3 W 00, your average speed is 75 miles per hour. I'm not sure if the police can give you
    a ticket. You could say to the judge, "When was I doing 75 ? " The police would have
    to admit that they have no idea--but they would have a definite feeling that you must
    have been doing 75 sometime.

      We return to the central problem--computing v.10/ at the instant t D 10: The
    average velocity over the next second is 21: We can also find the average over the
    half-second between t D 10:0 and t D 10:5: Divide the change in distance by the
    change in time:

    f .10:5/ ¡ f .10:0/ D .10:5/2 ¡ .10:0/2 D 110:25 ¡ 100 D 20:5:
    10:5 ¡ 10:0     :5                       :5

    That average of 20:5 is closer to the speed at t D 10: It is still not exact.
      The way to find v.10/ is to keep reducing the time interval. This is the basis for

    Chapter 2; and the key to differential calculus. Find the slope between points that
    are closer and closer on the curve. The "limit" is the slope at a single point.

      Algebra gives the average velocity between t D 10 and any later time t D 10 C h:
    The distance increases from 102 to .10 C h/2: The change in time is h: So divide:

    v .10 C h/2 average D ¡ 102 D 100 C 20h C h2 ¡ 100 D 20 C h: (2)
                 h           h

    This formula fits our previous calculations. The interval from t D 10 to t D 11 had
    h D 1, and the average was 20 C h D 21: When the time step was h D 12 , the
    average was 20 C 12 D 20:5: Over a millionth of a second the average will be 20
    plus 1=1; 000; 000--which is very near 20:

    Conclusion: The velocity at t D 10 is v D 20. That is the slope of the curve. It
    agrees with the v-graph on the left side of Figure 1.12, which also has v.10/ D 20:

     This is our first encounter with the much despised "Mean Value Theorem." If the judge can
    prove the theorem, you are dead. A few v-graphs and f -graphs will confuse the situation.
   1.3 The Velocity at an Instant                                                             69

  We now show that the two graphs match at all times. If f .t/ D t2 then v.t/ D 2t:
You are seeing the key computation of calculus, and we can put it into words before
equations. Compute the distance at time t C h, subtract the distance at time t, and
divide by h: That gives the average velocity:

v f .t C h/ ave D ¡ f .t/ D .t C h/2 ¡ t2 D t2 C 2th C h2 ¡ t2 D 2t C h: (3)
h           h                                  h

This fits the previous calculation, where t was 10: The average was 20 C h: Now the
average is 2t C h: It depends on the time step h, because the velocity is changing. But
we can see what happens as h approaches zero. The average is closer and closer to
the speedometer reading of 2t, at the exact moment when the clock shows time t:

1E As h approaches zero, the average velocity 2t C h approaches v.t/ D 2t:

Note The computation (3) shows how calculus needs algebra. If we want the whole
v-graph, we have to let time be a "variable." It is represented by the letter t: Numbers
are enough at the specific time t D 10 and the specific step h D 1--but algebra gets
beyond that. The average between any t and any t C h is 2t C h: Please don't hesitate
to put back numbers for the letters--that checks the algebra.

  There is also a step beyond algebra! Calculus requires the limit of the average.
As h shrinks to zero, the points on the graph come closer. "Average over an interval"
becomes "velocity at an instant." The general theory of limits is not particularly
simple, but here we don't need it. (It isn't particularly hard either.) In this example
the limiting value is easy to identify. The average 2t C h approaches 2t, as h 0:

  What remains to do in this section ? We answered Question 2--to find velocity
from distance. We have not answered Question 1: If v.t/ D 2t increases linearly with

time, what is the distance ? This goes in the opposite direction (it is integration).
  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that no new work is necessary. If the

slope of f .t/ leads to v.t/, then the area under that v-graph leads back to the
f -graph. The odometer readings f D t2 produced speedometer readings v D 2t:
By the Fundamental Theorem, the area under 2t should be t2: But we have certainly

not proved any fundamental theorems, so it is better to be safe--by actually
computing the area.

  Fortunately, it is the area of a triangle. The base of the triangle is t and the height is
v D 2t: The area agrees with f .t/:

area  D  1  .base/.height/  D  1  .t  /.2t  /  D  t  2:                     (4)
         2                     2

EXAMPLE 1 The graphs are shifted in time. The car doesn't start until t D 1:

Therefore v D 0 and f D 0 up to that time. After the car starts we have v D 2.t ¡ 1/
and f D .t ¡ 1/2: You see how the time delay of 1 enters the formulas. Figure 1.13

shows how it affects the graphs.

EXAMPLE 2 The acceleration changes from 2 to another constant a: The velocity
changes from v D 2t to v D at: The acceleration is the slope of the velocity curve!
The distance is also proportional to a, but notice the factor 21 :

       acceleration a  velocity v D at  distance f D 12 at2:

If a equals 1, then v D t and f D 12 t2: That is one of the most famous pairs in
calculus. If a equals the gravitational constant g, then v D gt is the velocity of a

    falling body. The speed doesn't depend on the mass (tested by Galileo at the
    Leaning Tower of Pisa). Maybe he saw the distance f D 12 gt2 more easily than the
    speed v D gt: Anyway, this is the most famous pair in physics.

    EXAMPLE 3 Suppose f .t/ D 3t C t2: The average velocity from t to t C h is

               v f .t C h/ ave D ¡ f .t/ D 3.t C h/ C .t C h/2 ¡ 3t ¡ t2 :
                        h                                        h

    The change in distance has an extra 3h (coming from 3.t C h/ minus 3t). The velocity
    contains an additional 3 (coming from 3h divided by h). When 3t is added to the
    distance, 3 is added to the velocity. If Galileo had thrown a weight instead of dropping
    it, the starting velocity v0 would have added v0t to the distance.

                                        FUNCTIONS ACROSS TIME

    The idea of slope is not difficult--for one straight line. Divide the change in f by
    the change in t: In Chapter 2; divide the change in y by the change in x: Experience
    shows that the hard part is to see what happens to the slope as the line moves.

      Figure 1.14a shows the line between points A and B on the curve. This is a "secant
    line." Its slope is an average velocity. What calculus does is to bring that point B
    down the curve toward A:

            Fig. 1.14 Slope of line, slope of curve. Two velocity graphs. Which is which ?

    Question 1 What happens to the "change in f "--the height of B above A ?
    Answer The change in f decreases to zero. So does the change in t:
                                                          1.3 The Velocity at an Instant                                                  71

                     Question 2 As B approaches A, does the slope of the line increase or decrease ?
                     Answer I am not going to answer that question. It is too important. Draw another
                     secant line with B closer to A: Compare the slopes.

                       This question was created by Steve Monk at the University of Washington--where
                     57% of the class gave the right answer. Probably 97% would have found the right
                     slope from a formula. Figure 1.14b shows the opposite problem. We know the
                     velocity, not the distance. But calculus answers questions about both functions.

                     Question 3 Which car is going faster at time t D 3=4 ?
                     Answer Car C has higher speed. Car D has greater acceleration.

                     Question 4 If the cars start together, is D catching up to C at the end ? Between

                     t  D  1  and    t  D 1,     do  the  cars  get  closer  or  further  apart ?
                           2

                     Answer This time more than half the class got it wrong. You won't but you can see

                     why they did. You have to look at the speed graph and imagine the distance graph.

                     When car C is going faster, the distance between them                               :

                        To repeat: The cars start together, but they don't finish together. They reach the

                     same speed at t D 1, not the same distance. Car C went faster. You really should draw

                     their distance graphs, to see how they bend.

                        These problems help to emphasize one more point. Finding the speed (or slope) is

                     entirely different from finding the distance (or area):

                        1. To find the slope of the f -graph at a particular time t, you don't have to know
                           the whole history.

                        2. To find the area under the v-graph up to a particular time t, you do have to
                           know the whole history.

                     A short record of distance is enough to recover v.t/: Point B moves toward point A:
                     The problem of slope is local--the speed is completely decided by f .t/ near point A:

                       In contrast, a short record of speed is not enough to recover the total distance. We
                     have to know what the mileage was earlier. Otherwise we can only know the increase
                     in mileage, not the total.

                                                                     1.3 EXERCISES

                         1.4 Circular Motion

This section introduces completely new distances and velocities--the sines and
cosines from trigonometry. As I write that last word, I ask myself how much
trigonometry it is essential to know. There will be the basic picture of a right
triangle, with sides cos t and sin t and 1: There will also be the crucial equation
.cos t/2 C .sin t/2 D 1, which is Pythagoras' law a2 C b2 D c2: The squares of two
sides add to the square of the hypotenuse (and the 1 is really 12). Nothing else is
needed immediately. If you don't know trigonometry, don't stop--an important part
can be learned now.

  You will recognize the wavy graphs of the sine and cosine. We intend to find the
slopes of those graphs. That can be done without using the formulas for sin.x C y/
and cos.x C y/--which later give the same slopes in a more algebraic way. Here it is
only basic things that are needed. And anyway, how complicated can a triangle be ?

Remark You might think trigonometry is only for surveyors and navigators
(people with triangles). Not at all! By far the biggest applications are to rotation and
vibration and oscillation. It is fantastic that sines and cosines are so perfect for
"repeating motion"--around a circle or up and down.

       Fig. 1.15 As the angle t changes, the graphs show the sides of the right triangle.

   Our underlying goal is to offer one more example in which the velocity can be
computed by common sense. Calculus is mainly an extension of common sense, but
here that extension is not needed. We will find the slope of the sine curve. The straight
line f D vt was easy and the parabola f D 12 at2 was harder. The new example also
involves realistic motion, seen every day. We start with circular motion, in which the
position is given and the velocity will be found.

   A ball goes around a circle of radius one. The center is at x D 0; y D 0 (the
origin). The x and y coordinates satisfy x2 C y2 D 12, to keep the ball on the circle.
We specify its position in Figure 1.16a by giving its angle with the horizontal. And
we make the ball travel with constant speed, by requiring that the angle is equal to
the time t: The ball goes counterclockwise. At time 1 it reaches the point where the
angle equals 1: The angle is measured in radians rather than degrees, so a full circle
is completed at t D 2 instead of t D 360:

   The ball starts on the x axis, where the angle is zero. Now find it at time t:

                The ball is at the point where x D cos t and y D sin t:

 Sines and cosines are so important that I added a review of trigonometry in Section 1:5: But
the concepts in this section can be more valuable than formulas.
74  1 Introduction to Calculus

    This is where trigonometry is useful. The cosine oscillates between 1 and ¡1, as the

    ball goes from far right to far left and back again. The sine also oscillates between 1

    and ¡1, starting from sin 0 D 0: At time =2 the sine (the height) increases to one.

    The cosine is zero and the ball reaches the top point x D 0; y D 1: At time  the cosine

    is ¡1 and the sine is back to zero--the coordinates are .¡1; 0/: At t D 2 the circle

    is complete (the angle is also 2), and x D cos 2 D 1; y D sin 2 D 0:

         Fig. 1.16 Circular motion with speed 1; angle t, height sin t, upward velocity cos t:

      Important point: The distance around the circle (its circumference) is 2 r D 2,
    because the radius is 1: The ball travels a distance 2 in a time 2: The speed equals
    1: It remains to find the velocity, which involves not only speed but direction.

    Degrees vs. radians A full circle is 360 degrees and 2 radians. Therefore

                          1 radian D 360=2 degrees 57:3 degrees
                          1 degreeD 2=360 radians :01745 radians

    Radians were invented to avoid those numbers! The speed is exactly 1; reaching t
    radians at time t: The speed would be :01745; if the ball only reached t degrees. The
    ball would complete the circle at time T D 360: We cannot accept the division of the
    circle into 360 pieces (by whom ? ), which produces these numbers.

      To check degree mode vs. radian mode, verify that sin 1¥ :017 and sin 1 :84:

                                         VELOCITY OF THE BALL

    At time t, which direction is the ball going ? Calculus watches the motion between t
    and t C h: For a ball on a string, we don't need calculus--just let go. The direction of
    motion is tangent to the circle. With no force to keep it on the circle, the ball goes off
    on a tangent. If the ball is the moon, the force is gravity. If it is a hammer swinging
    around on a chain, the force is from the center. When the thrower lets go, the hammer
    takes off--and it is an art to pick the right moment. (I once saw a friend hit by a
    hammer at MIT. He survived, but the thrower quit track.) Calculus will find that same
    tangent direction, when the points at t and t C h come close.

      The "velocity triangle" is in Figure 1.16b. It is the same as the position triangle,

    but rotated through 90¥: The hypotenuse is tangent to the circle, in the direction the

    ball is moving. Its length equals 1 (the speed). The angle t still appears, but now it
    is the angle with the vertical. The upward component of velocity is cos t; when the
    upward component of position is sin t: That is our common sense calculation, based
1.4 Circular Motion                                                                          75

on a figure rather than a formula. The rest of this section depends on it--and we check
v D cos t at special points.

  At the starting time t D 0, the movement is all upward. The height is sin 0 D 0 and
the upward velocity is cos 0 D 1: At time =2, the ball reaches the top. The height
is sin =2 D 1 and the upward velocity is cos =2 D 0: At that instant the ball is not
moving up or down.

  The horizontal velocity contains a minus sign. At first the ball travels to the left. The

value of x is cos t, but the speed in the x direction is ¡ sin t: Half of trigonometry

is in that figure (the good half), and you see how sin2t C cos2t D 1 is so basic. That
equation applies to position and velocity, at every time.

  Application of plane geometry: The right triangles in Figure 1.16 are the same
size and shape. They look congruent and they are--the angle t above the ball equals

the angle t at the center. That is because the three angles at the ball add to 180¥.

                           OSCILLATION: UP AND DOWN MOTION

We now use circular motion to study straight-line motion. That line will be the y axis.
Instead of a ball going around a circle, a mass will move up and down. It oscillates

between y D 1 and y D ¡1: The mass is the "shadow of the ball," as we explain in a

moment.

 There is a jumpy oscillation that we do not want, with v D 1 and v D ¡1: That

"bang-bang" velocity is like a billiard ball, bouncing between two walls without
slowing down. If the distance between the walls is 2; then at t D 4 the ball is back
to the start. The distance graph is a zigzag (or sawtooth) from Section 1:2:

 We prefer a smoother motion. Instead of velocities that jump between C1 and ¡1,

a real oscillation slows down to zero and gradually builds up speed again. The mass
is on a spring, which pulls it back. The velocity drops to zero as the spring is fully
stretched. Then v is negative, as the mass goes the same distance in the opposite
direction. Simple harmonic motion is the most important back and forth motion,
while f D vt and f D 12 at2 are the most important one-way motions.

    Fig. 1.17 Circular motion of the ball and harmonic motion of the mass (its shadow).

  How do we describe this oscillation ? The best way is to match it with the ball on
the circle. The height of the ball will be the height of the mass. The "shadow of the
ball" goes up and down, level with the ball. As the ball passes the top of the circle, the
mass stops at the top and starts down. As the ball goes around the bottom, the mass
stops and turns back up the y axis. Halfway up (or down), the speed is 1:

  Figure 1.17a shows the mass at a typical time t: The height is y D f .t/ D sin t,

level with the ball. This height oscillates between f D 1 and f D ¡1: But the mass
76             1 Introduction to Calculus

    does not move with constant speed. The speed of the mass is changing although the
    speed of the ball is always 1. The time for a full cycle is still 2, but within that cycle
    the mass speeds up and slows down. The problem is to find the changing velocity v:
    Since the distance is f D sin t, the velocity will be the slope of the sine curve.

                                   THE SLOPE OF THE SINE CURVE

    At the top and bottom (t D =2 and t D 3=2) the ball changes direction and v D 0:
    The slope at the top and bottom of the sine curve is zero. At time zero, when the ball
    is going straight up, the slope of the sine curve is v D 1: At t D , when the ball and

    mass and f -graph are going down, the velocity is v D ¡1: The mass goes fastest at the

    center. The mass goes slowest (in fact it stops) when the height reaches a maximum
    or minimum. The velocity triangle yields v at every time t:

      To find the upward velocity of the mass, look at the upward velocity of the ball.
    Those velocities are the same! The mass and ball stay level, and we know v from
    circular motion: The upward velocity is v D cos t:

      Figure 1.18 shows the result we want. On the right, f D sin t gives the height. On
    the left is the velocity v D cos t: That velocity is the slope of the f -curve. The height
    and velocity (red lines) are oscillating together, but they are out of phase--just as the
    position triangle and velocity triangle were at right angles. This is absolutely fantastic,
    that in calculus the two most famous functions of trigonometry form a pair: The slope
    of the sine curve is given by the cosine curve.

               When the distance is f .t/ D sin t, the velocity is v.t/ D cos t:

      Admission of guilt: The slope of sin t was not computed in the standard way.
    Previously we compared .t C h/2 with t2, and divided that distance by h: This average

    velocity approached the slope 2t as h became small. For sin t we could have done

    the same:

               average velocity D change in sin t D sin.t C h/ ¡ sin t : (1)
               change in t                 h

    This is where we need the formula for sin.t C h/, coming soon. Somehow the ratio

    in (1) should approach cos t as h 0: (It does.) The sine and cosine fit the same
    pattern as t2 and 2t--our shortcut was to watch the shadow of motion around a circle.

         Fig. 1.18 v D cos t when f D sin t (red); v D ¡ sin t when f D cos t (black).

     That looks easy but you will see later that it is extremely important. At a maximum or
    minimum the slope is zero. The curve levels off.
1.4 Circular Motion                                                                      77

Question 1 What if the ball goes twice as fast, to reach angle 2t at time t ?

Answer The speed is now 2: The time for a full circle is only : The ball's
position is x D cos 2t and y D sin 2t: The velocity is still tangent to the circle--but
the tangent is at angle 2t where the ball is. Therefore cos 2t enters the upward

velocity and ¡ sin 2t enters the horizontal velocity. The difference is that the

velocity triangle is twice as big. The upward velocity is not cos 2t but 2 cos 2t: The

horizontal velocity is ¡2 sin 2t: Notice these 2's!

Question 2 What is the area under the cosine curve from t D 0 to t D =2 ?

You can answer that, if you accept the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus--
computing areas is the opposite of computing slopes. The slope of sin t is cos t,
so the area under cos t is the increase in sin t: No reason to believe that yet, but we
use it anyway.

  From sin 0 D 0 to sin =2 D 1, the increase is 1: Please realize the power of
calculus. No other method could compute the area under a cosine curve so fast.

                             THE SLOPE OF THE COSINE CURVE

I cannot resist uncovering another distance and velocity (another f -v pair) with no
extra work. This time f is the cosine. The time clock starts at the top of the circle.
The old time t D =2 is now t D 0: The dotted lines in Figure 1.18 show the new start.
But the shadow has exactly the same motion--the ball keeps going around the circle,
and the mass follows it up and down. The f -graph and v-graph are still correct, both
with a time shift of =2:

  The new f -graph is the cosine. The new v-graph is minus the sine. The slope of
the cosine curve follows the negative of the sine curve. That is another famous pair,
twins of the first:

      When the distance is f .t/ D cos t; the velocity is v.t/ D ¡ sin t:

You could see that coming, by watching the ball go left and right (instead of up and

down). Its distance across is f D cos t: Its velocity across is v D ¡ sin t: That twin

pair completes the calculus in Chapter 1 (trigonometry to come). We review the ideas:

                  v is the velocity
                       the slope of the distance curve
                       the limit of average velocity over a short time
                       the derivative of f:

                  f is the distance
                       the area under the velocity curve
                       the limit of total distance over many short times
                       the integral of v:

Differential calculus: Compute v from f . Integral calculus: Compute f from v:

With constant velocity, f equals vt: With constant acceleration, v D at and f D 12 at2:
In harmonic motion, v D cos t and f D sin t: One part of our goal is to extend that
list--for which we need the tools of calculus. Another and more important part is to
put these ideas to use.

  Before the chapter ends, may I add a note about the book and the course ? The
book is more personal than usual, and I hope readers will approve. What I write is
78                      1 Introduction to Calculus

    very close to what I would say, if you were in this room. The sentences are spoken
    before they are written. Calculus is alive and moving forward--it needs to be taught
    that way.

      One new part of the subject has come with the computer. It works with a finite step
    h, not an "infinitesimal" limit. What it can do, it does quickly--even if it
    cannot find exact slopes or areas. The result is an overwhelming growth in the range
    of problems that can be solved. We landed on the moon because f and v were so
    accurate. (The moon's orbit has sines and cosines, the spacecraft starts with v D at
    and f D 12 at2: Only the computer can account for the atmosphere and the sun's
    gravity and the changing mass of the spacecraft.) Modern mathematics is a
    combination of exact formulas and approximate computations. Neither part can be
    ignored, and I hope you will see numerically what we derive algebraically. The
    exercises are to help you master both parts.

      The course has made a quick start--not with an abstract discussion of sets or
    functions or limits, but with the concrete questions that led to those ideas. You have
    seen a distance function f and a limit v of average velocities. We will meet more
    functions and more limits (and their definitions!) but it is crucial to study important
    examples early. There is a lot to do, but the course has definitely begun.

80             1 Introduction to Calculus

    1.5 A Review of Trigonometry

    Trigonometry begins with a right triangle. The size of the triangle is not as important
    as the angles. We focus on one particular angle--call it --and on the ratios between
    the three sides x; y; r: The ratios don't change if the triangle is scaled to another size.
    Three sides give six ratios, which are the basic functions of trigonometry:

    Fig. 1.19  cos  D x D near side        sec  D r D 1
                         r hypotenuse               x cos 

               sin  D y D opposite side    csc  D r D 1
                         r hypotenuse               y sin 

               tan  D y D opposite side    cot  D x D 1
                         x near side                y tan 

    Of course those six ratios are not independent. The three on the right come directly
    from the three on the left. And the tangent is the sine divided by the cosine:

                                      tan  D sin  D y=r D y :
                                                 cos  x=r x

    Note that "tangent of an angle" and "tangent to a circle" and "tangent line to a graph"
    are different uses of the same word. As the cosine of  goes to zero, the tangent of

     goes to infinity. The side x becomes zero,  approaches 90¥; and the triangle is
    infinitely steep. The sine of 90¥ is y=r D 1:

      Triangles have a serious limitation. They are excellent for angles up to 90¥; and
    they are OK up to 180¥; but after that they fail. We cannot put a 240¥ angle into a

    triangle. Therefore we change now to a circle.

    Fig. 1.20 Trigonometry on a circle.Compare 2 sin  with sin 2 and tan  (periods 2; ; ).

      Angles are measured from the positive x axis (counterclockwise). Thus 90¥ is
    straight up, 180¥ is to the left, and 360¥ is in the same direction as 0¥: (Then 450¥ is
    the same as 90¥:) Each angle yields a point on the circle of radius r: The coordinates x

    and y of that point can be negative (but never r). As the point goes around the circle,
    the six ratios cos ; sin ; tan ; : : : trace out six graphs. The cosine waveform is the

    same as the sine waveform--just shifted by 90¥:

      One more change comes with the move to a circle. Degrees are out. Radians are
    in. The distance around the whole circle is 2 r: The distance around to other points
    is  r: We measure the angle by that multiple . For a half-circle the distance is  r,
                                1.5 A Review of Trigonometry                                                   81

so the angle is  radians--which is 180¥: A quarter-circle is =2 radians or 90¥: The

distance around to angle  is r times .                                              45¥

When  r    D  1  this  is  the  ultimate  in  simplicity:  The  distance  is  :  A       angle   is  1  of  a
circle and 2=8 radians--and the length of the circular arc is 2=8: Similarly for 1¥:                 8

360¥ D 2 radians 1¥ D 2=360 radians 1 radian D 360=2 degrees.

An  angle  going  clockwise       is  negative.  The  angle  ¡=3  is  ¡60¥       and  takes  us  1   of  the
                                                                                                 6

wrong way around the circle. What is the effect on the six functions ?

 Certainly the radius r is not changed when we go to ¡: Also x is not changed (see
Figure 1.20a). But y reverses sign, because ¡ is below the axis when C is above.

This change in y affects y=r and y=x but not x=r:

     cos.¡/ D cos  sin .¡/ D ¡ sin  tan .¡/ D ¡ tan :

The cosine is even (no change). The sine and tangent are odd (change sign).                          300¥)

The  same     point    is  5  of  the  right  way  around.  Therefore  5  of  2     radians  (or
gives the same direction as ¡=3 radians or ¡60¥: A difference of 2 makes no66

difference to x; y; r. Thus sin  and cos  and the other four functions have period

2: We can go five times or a hundred times around the circle, adding 10 or 200

to the angle, and the six functions repeat themselves.

EXAMPLE Evaluate the six trigonometric functions at  D 2=3 (or  D ¡4=3).

This angle is shown in Figure 1.20a (where r D 1). The ratios are

     cos  D x=r D ¡1=2                 sin  D y=r D 3=2               tan  D y=x D ¡ 3
     sec  D ¡2                         csc  D 2= 3                    cot  D ¡1= 3

Those numbers illustrate basic facts about the sizes of four functions:

              cos  1 sin  1 sec  1 csc  1:

The tangent and cotangent can fall anywhere, as long as cot  D 1= tan :

 The numbers reveal more. The tangent ¡ 3 is the ratio of sine to cosine. The
secant ¡2 is 1= cos : Their squares are 3 and 4 (differing by 1). That may not seem

remarkable, but it is. There are three relationships in the squares of those six numbers,
and they are the key identities of trigonometry:

         cos2 C sin2 D 1 1 C tan2 D sec2 cot2 C 1 D csc2

Everything flows from the Pythagoras formula x2 C y2 D r2: Dividing by r2 gives
.x=r/2 C .y=r/2 D 1: That is cos2  C sin2  D 1: Dividing by x2 gives the second
identity, which is 1 C .y=x/2 D .r=x/2: Dividing by y2 gives the third. All three will

be needed throughout the book--and the first one has to be unforgettable.

                          DISTANCES AND ADDITION FORMULAS

To compute the distance between points we stay with Pythagoras. The points are in
Figure 1.21a. They are known by their x and y coordinates, and d is the distance
between them. The third point completes a right triangle.
82              1 Introduction to Calculus

     For the x distance along the bottom we don't need help. It is x2 ¡ x1 (or x2 ¡ x1
    since distances can't be negative). The distance up the side is y2 ¡ y1 : Pythagoras

    immediately gives the distance d :

                distance between points D d D .x2 ¡ x1/2 C .y2 ¡ y1/2:                 (1)

                Fig. 1.21 Distance between points and equal distances in two circles.

      By applying this distance formula in two identical circles, we discover the cosine

    of s ¡ t: (Subtracting angles is important.) In Figure 1.21b, the distance squared is

                d 2 D .change in x/2 C .change in y/2

                D .cos s ¡ cos t/2 C .sin s ¡ sin t/2:                                 (2)

    Figure 1.21c shows the same circle and triangle (but rotated). The same distance

    squared is  d 2 D .cos.s ¡ t/ ¡ 1/2 C .sin.s ¡ t//2:

                                                                                       (3)

    Now multiply out the squares in equations (2) and (3). Whenever .cosine/2 C .sin e/2
    appears, replace it by 1: The distances are the same, so .2/ D .3/:

                .2/ D 1 C1 ¡ 2 cos s cos t ¡ 2 sin s sin t
                .3/ D 1 C1 ¡ 2 cos.s ¡ t/:

    After canceling 1 C 1 and then ¡2, we have the "addition formula" for cos.s ¡ t/:

                The cosine of s ¡ t equals cos s cos t C sin s sin t:                  (4)
                The cosine of s C t equals cos s cos t ¡ sin s sin t:
                                                                                       (5)

    The easiest is t D 0: Then cos t D 1 and sin t D 0: The equations reduce to
    cos s D cos s:

     To go from (4) to (5) in all cases, replace t by ¡t: No change in cos t, but a "minus"
    appears with the sine. In the special case s D t, we have cos.t C t/ D .cos t/.cos t/ ¡

    .sin t/.sin t/: This is a much-used formula for cos 2t :

         Double angle: cos 2 t D cos2t ¡ sin2t D 2cos2t ¡ 1 D 1 ¡ 2sin2t: (6)

    I am constantly using cos2t C sin2t D 1, to switch between sines and cosines.

     We also need addition formulas and double-angle formulas for the sine of s ¡ t and

    s C t and 2t: For that we connect sine to cosine, rather than .sin e/2 to .cosine/2: The
                         1.5 A Review of Trigonometry                                                                     83

connection goes back to the ratio y=r in our original triangle. This is the sine of the

angle  and also the cosine of the complementary angle =2 ¡ :

            sin  D cos.=2 ¡ / and cos  D sin.=2 ¡ /:                                                               (7)

The complementary angle is =2 ¡  because the two angles add to =2 (a

right angle). By making this connection in Problem 19; formulas (4-5-6) move from

cosines to sines:

                         sin.s ¡ t/ D sin s cos t ¡ cos s sin t                                                    (8)

                         sin.s C t/ D sin s cos t C cos s sin t                                                    (9)

                                    sin 2t D sin.t C t/ D 2 sin t cos t                                            (10)

  I want to stop with these ten formulas, even if more are possible. Trigonometry is

full of identities that connect its six functions--basically because all those functions
come from a single right triangle. The x; y; r ratios and the equation x2 C y2 D r2

can be rewritten in many ways. But you have now seen the formulas that are needed

by ca1culus. They give derivatives in Chapter 2 and integrals in Chapter 5: And

it is typical of our subject to add something of its own--a limit in which an angle

approaches zero. The essence of calculus is in that limit.

                1.6 A Thousand Points of Light

The figures drawn below show y D sin n: This is very different
from y D sin x: The graph of sin x is one continuous curve. By the time it reaches
x D 10; 000, the curve has gone up and down 10; 000=2 times. Those 1591
oscillations would be so crowded that you couldn't see anything. The graph of sin n
has picked 10; 000 points from the curve--and for some reason those points seem to
lie on more than 40 separate sine curves.

  The second graph shows the first 1000 points. They don't seem to lie on sine curves.
Most people see hexagons. But they are the same thousand points! It is hard to believe
that the graphs are the same, but I have learned what to do. Tilt the second graph and
look from the side at a narrow angle. Now the first graph appears. I believe you will
see "diamonds." The narrow angle compresses the x axis--back to the scale of the
first graph.

  The effect of scale is something we don't think of. We understand it for maps.
Computers can zoom in or zoom out--those are changes of scale. What our eyes see
depends on what is "close." We think we see sine curves in the 10; 000 point graph,
and they raise several questions:

   1. Which points are near .0; 0/ ?
   2. How many sine curves are there ?
   3. Where does the middle curve, going upward from .0; 0/, come back to zero ?

A point near .0; 0/ really means that sin n is close to zero. That is certainly not true
of sin 1 (1 is one radian!). In fact sin 1 is up the axis at :84; at the start of the seventh
sine curve. Similarly sin 2 is :91 and sin 3 is :14: (The numbers 3 and :14 make us

think of : The sine of 3 equals the sine of  ¡ 3: Then sin :14 is near :14:) Similarly

sin 4; sin 5; . . . , sin 21 are not especially close to zero.
  The first point to come close is sin 22: This is because 22=7 is near : Then 22 is

close to 7, whose sine is zero:

                sin 22 D sin.7 ¡ 22/ sin.¡:01/ ¡:01:

That is the first point to the right of .0; 0/ and slightly below. You can see it on
graph 1; and more clearly on graph 2: It begins a curve downward.

  The next point to come close is sin 44: This is because 44 is just past 14:

                     44 14 C :02 so sin 44 sin :02 :02:

This point .44; sin 44/ starts the middle sine curve. Next is .88; sin 88/:
86  1 Introduction to Calculus

      Now we know something. There are 44 curves. They begin near the heights sin 0;
    sin 1; : : :; sin 43: Of these 44 curves, 22 start upward and 22 start downward. I was
    confused at first, because I could only find 42 curves. The reason is that sin 11 equals

    ¡0:99999 and sin 33 equals .9999: Those are so close to the bottom and top that
    you can't see their curves. The sine of 11 is near ¡1 because sin 22 is near zero. It is

    almost impossible to follow a single curve past the top--coming back down it is not
    the curve you think it is.

      The points on the middle curve are at n D 0 and 44 and 88 and every number 44N:
    Where does that curve come back to zero ? In other words, when does 44N come
    very close to a multiple of  ? We know that 44 is 14 C :02: More exactly 44 is
    14 C :0177: So we multiply :0177 until we reach :

              if N D =:0177 then 44N D .14 C :0177/N D 14N C :

    This gives N D 177:5: At that point 44N D 7810: This is half the period of the sine
    curve. The sine of 7810 is very near zero.

      If you follow the middle sine curve, you will see it come back to zero above 7810:

    The actual points on that curve have n D 44 ¤ 177 and n D 44 ¤ 178, with sines just

    above and below zero. Halfway between is n D 7810: The equation for the middle
    sine curve is y D sin.x=7810/. Its period is 15; 620--beyond our graph.

    Question The fourth point on that middle curve looks the same as the fourth point
    coming down from sin 3: What is this "double point ? "
    Answer 4 times 44 is 176: On the curve going up, the point is .176; sin 176/: On the
    curve coming down it is .179; sin 179/: The sines of 176 and 179 differ only by
    .00003:

      The second graph spreads out this double point. Look above 176 and 179; at the
    center of a hexagon. You can follow the sine curve all the way across graph 2:

      Only a little question remains. Why does graph 2 have hexagons ? I don't know.
    The problem is with your eyes. To understand the hexagons, Doug Hardin plotted
    points on straight lines as well as sine curves. Graph 3 shows y D fractional part of
    n=2: Then he made a second copy, turned it over, and placed it on top. That produced
    graph 4--with hexagons. Graphs 3 and 4 are on the next page.

      This is called a Moiré pattern. If you can get a transparent copy of graph 3; and
    turn it slowly over the original, you will see fantastic hexagons. They come from
    interference between periodic patterns--in our case 44=7 and 25=4 and 19=3 are near
    2: This interference is an enemy of printers, when color screens don't line up. It can
    cause vertical lines on a TV. Also in making cloth, operators get dizzy from seeing
    Moiré patterns move. There are good applications in engineering and optics--but
    we have to get back to calculus.
     CHAPTER 2

Derivatives

2.1 The Derivative of a Function

This chapter begins with the definition of the derivative. Two examples were in
Chapter 1: When the distance is t 2, the velocity is 2t: When f .t / D sin t we found
v.t/ D cos t: The velocity is now called the derivative of f .t/: As we move to a

more formal definition and new examples, we use new symbols f ½ and df =dt for the

derivative.

2A At time t , the derivative f ½.t / or df =dt or v.t / is

f ½.t/ D lim f .t C t/ ¡ f .t/: (1)
t 0  t

The ratio on the right is the average velocity over a short time t: The derivative, on
the left side, is its limit as the step t (delta t ) approaches zero.

  Go slowly and look at each piece. The distance at time t C t is f .t C t /: The
distance at time t is f .t /: Subtraction gives the change in distance, between those

times. We often write f for this difference: f D f .t C t / ¡ f .t /: The average

velocity is the ratio f =t--change in distance divided by change in time.
  The limit of the average velocity is the derivative, if this limit exists:

                                      df D lim f : (2)
                                       dt t 0 t

This is the neat notation that Leibniz invented: f =t approaches df =dt: Behind
the innocent word "limit" is a process that this course will help you understand.

  Note that f is not  times f ! It is the change in f: Similarly t is not
 times t: It is the time step, positive or negative and eventually small. To have a
one-letter symbol we replace t by h:

  The right sides of (1) and (2) contain average speeds. On the graph of f .t /, the
distance up is divided by the distance across. That gives the average slope f =t:

  The left sides of (1) and (2) are instantaneous speeds df =dt: They give the slope
at the instant t: This is the derivative df =dt (when t and f shrink to zero). Look
again at the calculation for f .t / D t 2:

                                                                                        87
88          2 Derivatives

    f D f .t C t/ ¡ f .t/ D t2 C 2t t C .t/2 ¡ t2 D 2t C t: (3)
    t  t    t

    Important point: Those steps are taken before t goes to zero. If we set t D 0 too
    soon, we learn nothing. The ratio f =t becomes 0=0 (which is meaningless).
    The numbers f and t must approach zero together, not separately. Here their
    ratio is 2t C t , the average speed.

      To repeat: Success came by writing out .t C t /2 and subtracting t 2 and dividing
    by t: Then and only then can we approach t D 0: The limit is the derivative 2t:

      There are several new things in formulas (1) and (2). Some are easy but important,
    others are more profound. The idea of a function we will come back to, and the
    definition of a limit. But the notations can be discussed right away. They are used
    constantly and you also need to know how to read them aloud:

          f .t / D "f of t " D the value of the function f at time t

            t D "delta t " D the time step forward or backward from t

    f .t C t / D "f of t plus delta t " D the value of f at time t C t

        f = "delta f " D the change f .t C t/ ¡ f .t/

      f =t D "delta f over delta t " D the average velocity

         f ½.t / D "f prime of t " D the value of the derivative at time t
       df =dt D "d f d t " D the same as f ½ (the instantaneous velocity)

           lim D "limit as delta t goes to zero" D the process that starts with
            0 numbers f =t and produces the number df =dt:

    From those last words you see what lies behind the notation df =dt: The symbol t
    indicates a nonzero (usually short) length of time. The symbol dt indicates
    an infinitesimal (even shorter) length of time. Some mathematicians work separately
    with df and dt , and df =dt is their ratio. For us df =dt is a single notation (don't
    cancel d and don't cancel ). The derivative df =dt is the limit of f =t: When

    that notation df =dt is awkward, use f ½ or v:

    Remark The notation hides one thing we should mention. The time step can be
    negative just as easily as positive. We can compute the average f =t over a time
    interval before the time t , instead of after. This ratio also approaches df =dt:

      The notation also hides another thing: The derivative might not exist. The
    averages f =t might not approach a limit (it has to be the same limit going forward

    and backward from time t ). In that case f ½.t / is not defined. At that instant there is

    no clear reading on the speedometer. This will happen in Example 2.

    EXAMPLE 1 (Constant velocity V D 2) The distance f is V times t: The distance
    at time t C t is V times t C t: The difference f is V times t:

       f D Vt D V so the limit is df D V:
       t t                 dt

    The derivative of V t is V: The derivative of 2t is 2: The averages f =t are always
    V D 2, in this exceptional case of a constant velocity.
2.1 The Derivative of a Function                                                           89

EXAMPLE 2 Constant velocity 2 up to time t D 3, then stop.

For small times we still have f .t / D 2t: But after the stopping time, the distance
is fixed at f .t / D 6: The graph is flat beyond time 3. Then f .t C t / D f .t / and
f D 0 and the derivative of a constant function is zero:

t 3W f ½.t/ D lim f .t C t/ ¡ f .t/ D lim 0 D 0: (4)
   t 0                 t           t 0 t

In this example the derivative is not defined at the instant when t D 3. The velocity
falls suddenly from 2 to zero. The ratio f =t depends, at that special moment, on
whether t is positive or negative. The average velocity after time t D 3 is zero. The
average velocity before that time is 2: When the graph of f has a corner, the graph
of v has a jump. It is a step function.

  One new part of that example is the notation (df =dt or f ½ instead of v). Please

look also at the third figure. It shows how the function takes t (on the left) to f .t /:
Especially it shows t and f: At the start, f =t is 2. After the stop at t D 3, all
t 's go to the same f .t / D 6: So f D 0 and df =dt D 0:

Fig. 2.1 The derivative is 2 then 0: It does not exist at t D 3:

   THE DERIVATIVE OF 1=t

Here is a completely different slope, for the "demand function" f .t / D 1=t:

The demand is 1=t when the price is t: A high price t means a low demand 1=t:

Increasing the price reduces the demand. The calculus question is: How quickly

does 1=t change when t changes ? The "marginal demand" is the slope of the

demand curve.

 The big thing is to find the derivative of 1=t once and for all. It is ¡1=t 2:

EXAMPLE 3 f .t/ D 1 has f D 1 ¡ 1 : This equals t ¡ .t C t/ D ¡t :
t                      t Ct t      t.t C t/ t.t C t/

Divide by t and let t  0 W f D ¡1 approaches df D 2 ¡1 :
                       t t.t C t/                           dt t

  Line 1 is algebra, line 2 is calculus. The first step in line 1 subtracts f .t / from
f .t C t /: The difference is 1=.t C t / minus 1=t: The common denominator is t
times t C t --this makes the algebra possible. We can't set t D 0 in line 2; until
we have divided by t:

 The average is f =t D ¡1=t .t C t /: Now set t D 0: The derivative is ¡1=t2:

Section 2:4 will discuss the first of many cases when substituting t D 0 is not

possible, and the idea of a limit has to be made clearer.
90  2 Derivatives

    Fig. 2.2 Average slope is ¡ 61 , true slope is ¡ 41 : Increase in t produces decrease in f:

      Check the algebra at t D 2 and t C t D 3: The demand 1=t drops from 1=2 to

    1=3: The difference is f D ¡1=6, which agrees with ¡1=.2/.3/ in line 1. As the
    steps f and t get smaller, their ratio approaches ¡1=.2/.2/ D ¡1=4:

      This derivative is negative. The function 1=t is decreasing, and f is below
    zero. The graph is going downward in Figure 2.2, and its slope is negative:

    An increasing f .t/ has positive slope. A decreasing f .t/ has negative slope.

    The slope ¡1=t 2 is very negative for small t: A price increase severely cuts demand.

      The next figure makes a small but important point. There is nothing sacred about t:
    Other letters can be used--especially x: A quantity can depend on position instead
    of time. The height changes as we go west. The area of a square changes as the side
    changes. Those are not affected by the passage of time, and there is no reason to use
    t: You will often see y D f .x/, with x across and y up--connected by a function f:

      Similarly, f is not the only possibility. Not every function is named f ! That letter
    is useful because it stands for the word function--but we are perfectly entitled to write
    y.x/ or y.t / instead of f .x/ or f .t /: The distance up is a function of the distance
    across. This relationship "y of x" is all-important to mathematics.

      The slope is also a function. Calculus is about two functions, y.x/ and dy=dx:

    Question If we add 1 to y.x/, what happens to the slope ? Answer Nothing.

    Question If we add 1 to the slope, what happens to the height ? Answer     :

      The symbols t and x represent independent variables--they take any value they
    want to (in the domain). Once they are set, f .t / and y.x/ are determined. Thus f and
    y represent dependent variables--they depend on t and x: A change t produces a

    Fig. 2.3 The derivative of 1=t is ¡1=t2: The slope of 1=x is ¡1=x2:
              2.1 The Derivative of a Function                                           91

change f: A change x produces y: The independent variable goes inside the
parentheses in f .t / and y.x/: It is not the letter that matters, it is the idea:

           independent variable t or x
           dependent variable f or g or y or z or u

           derivative df =dt or df =dx or dy=dx or ¤ ¤ ¤

The derivative dy=dx comes from [change in y] divided by [change in x]. The time
step becomes a space step, forward or backward. The slope is the rate at which y
changes with x: The derivative of a function is its "rate of change."

  I mention that physics books use x.t / for distance. Darn it.
  To emphasize the definition of a derivative, here it is again with y and x:

y D y.x C x/ ¡ y.x/ D distance up  dy D lim y D y½.x/:
x          x  distance across
                                   dx x 0 x

The notation y½.x/ pins down the point x where the slope is computed. In dy=dx that

extra precision is omitted. This book will try for a reasonable compromise between

logical perfection and ordinary simplicity. The notation dy=dx.x/ is not good; y½.x/

is better; when x is understood it need not be written in parentheses.

  You are allowed to say that the function is y D x2 and the derivative is y½ D 2x--
even if the strict notation requires y.x/ D x2 and y½.x/ D 2x: You can even say that

the function is x2 and its derivative is 2x and its second derivative is 2--provided

everybody knows what you mean.

  Here is an example. It is a little early and optional but terrific. You get excellent
practice with letters and symbols, and out come new derivatives.

EXAMPLE 4 If u.x/ has slope du=dx, what is the slope of f .x/ D .u.x//2 ?

From the derivative of x2 this will give the derivative of x4: In that case u D x2
and f D x4: First point: The derivative of u2 is not .du=dx/2. We do not square

the derivative 2x: To find the "square rule" we start as we have to--with

f D f .x C x/ ¡ f .x/:

f D .u.x C x//2 ¡ .u.x//2 D OEu.x C x/ C u.x/OEu.x C x/ ¡ u.x/:

This algebra puts f in a convenient form. We factored a2 ¡ b2 into OEa C b times
OEa ¡ b: Notice that we don't have .u/2: We have f , the change in u2: Now

divide by x and take the limit:

f  D OEu.x C x/ C u.x/ u.x C x/ ¡ u.x/ approaches 2u.x/ du: (5)
x             x                                           dx

This is the square rule: The derivative of .u.x//2 is 2u.x/ times du=dx. From the
derivatives of x2 and 1=x and sin x (all known) the examples give new derivatives.

EXAMPLE 5  .u D x2/ The derivative of x4 is 2u du=dx D 2.x2/.2x/ D 4x3:
EXAMPLE 6
EXAMPLE 7  .u D 1=x/ The derivative of 1=x2 is 2u du=dx D .2=x/.¡1=x2/ D ¡2=x3:

           .u D sin x; du=dx D cos x/ The derivative of u2 D sin2x is 2 sin x cos x:

  Mathematics is really about ideas. The notation is created to express those ideas.
Newton and Leibniz invented calculus independently, and Newton's friends spent
92                                                                         2 Derivatives

                            a lot of time proving that he was first. He was, but it was Leibniz who thought of
                            writing dy=dx--which caught on. It is the perfect way to suggest the limit of y=x:
                            Newton was one of the great scientists of all time, and calculus was one of the great
                            inventions of all time-but the notation must help. You now can write and speak about
                            the derivative. What is needed is a longer list of functions and derivatives.

                                                                           2.1 EXERCISES

                2.2 Powers and Polynomials

    This section has two main goals. One is to find the derivatives of f .x/ D x3 and
    x4 and x5 (and more generally f .x/ D xn). The power or exponent n is at first a
    positive integer. Later we allow x and x2:2 and every xn:

      The other goal is different. While computing these derivatives, we look ahead to

    their applications. In using calculus, we meet equations with derivatives in them--

    "differential equations." It is too early to solve those equations. But it is not too

    early to see the purpose of what we are doing. Our examples come from economics

    and biology.

     With n D 2, the derivative of x2 is 2x: With n D ¡1, the slope of x¡1 is ¡1x¡2:

    Those are two pieces in a beautiful pattern, which it will be a pleasure to discover. We
    begin with x3 and its derivative 3x2, before jumping to xn:

    EXAMPLE 1 If f .x/ D x3 then f D .x C h/3 ¡ x3 D .x3 C 3x2h C 3xh2 C h3/ ¡ x3:

    Step 1: Cancel x3:     Step 2: Divide by h:                    Step 3: h goes to zero.

             f D 3x2 C 3xh C h2 approaches df D 3x2:
             h                                   dx

    That is straightforward, and you see the crucial step. The power .x C h/3 yields four
    separate terms x3 C 3x2h C 3xh2 C h3: (Notice 1, 3, 3, 1:) After x3 is subtracted,
    we can divide by h: At the limit .h D 0/ we have 3x2:

      For f .x/ D xn the plan is the same. A step of size h leads to f .x C h/ D .x C h/n:
    One reason for algebra is to calculate powers like .x C h/n, and if you have forgotten

    the binomial formula we can recapture its main point. Start with n D 4:

             .x C h/.x C h/.x C h/.x C h/ D x4C <<< C h4:              (1)

    Multiplying the four x's gives x4: Multiplying the four h's gives h4: These are the

    easy terms, but not the crucial ones. The subtraction .x C h/4 ¡ x4 will remove x4,

    and the limiting step h 0 will wipe out h4 (even after division by h). The products
    that matter are those with exactly one h. In Example 1 with .x C h/3, this key term
    was 3x2h: Division by h left 3x2:

      With only one h, there are n places it can come from. Equation (1) has four
    h's in parentheses, and four ways to produce x3h: Therefore the key term is 4x3h:
    (Division by h leaves 4x3:) In general there are n parentheses and n ways to produce

    xn¡1h, so the binomial formula contains nxn¡1h:

                        .x C h/n D xn C nxn¡1h C ¤ ¤ ¤ C hn:           (2)

    2B For n D 1; 2; 3; 4; : : : ; the derivative of xn is nxn¡1:

    Subtract xn from (2). Divide by h: The key term is nxn¡1: The rest disappears as

    h 0:

          f D .x C h/n ¡ xn D nxn¡1h C ¤ ¤ ¤ C hn so df D nxn¡1:
          x             h  h                                       dx

    The terms replaced by the dots involve h2 and h3 and higher powers. After dividing
    by h, they still have at least one factor h: All those terms vanish as h approaches zero.

EXAMPLE 2 .x C h/4 D x4 C 4x3h C 6x2h2 C 4xh3 C h4: This is n D 4 in
detail.

Subtract x4, divide by h, let h 0: The derivative is 4x3: The coefficients 1; 4; 6; 4; 1
are in Pascal's triangle below. For .x C h/5 the next row is 1; 5; 10; ? .

Remark The missing terms in the binomial formula (replaced by the dots) contain

all the products xn¡j hj : An x or an h comes from each parenthesis. The binomial

coefficient "n choose j " is the number of ways to choose j h's out of n parenthe-

ses. It involves n factorial, which is n.n ¡ 1/ ¤ ¤ ¤.1/: Thus 5S D 5 ¤ 4 ¤ 3 ¤ 2 ¤ 1 D 120:

Notice that 1 C 4 C 6 C 4 C 1 equals 16; which is 24: Each row of Pascal's triangle

              DERIVATIVES OF POLYNOMIALS

Now we have an infinite list of functions and their derivatives:

              x x2 x3 x4 x5 ¤¤¤     1 2x 3x2 4x3 5x4 ¤ ¤ ¤

The derivative of xn is n times the next lower power xn¡1: That rule extends

beyond these integers 1; 2; 3; 4; 5 to all powers:

f D 1=x has f ½ D ¡1=x2 W        Example 3 of section 2:1            .n D ¡1/
f D 1=x2 has f ½ D ¡2=x3 W       Example 6 of section 2:1            .n D ¡2/

f D x has f ½ D 12 x¡1=2 W                                           .n  D  1  /

Remember that x¡2 means 1=x2 and x¡1=2 means 1= x: Negative powers lead

to decreasing functions, approaching zero as x gets large. Their slopes have minus
signs.

Question What are the derivatives of x10 and x2:2 and x¡1=2 ?

Answer 10x9 and 2:2x1:2 and ¡ 12 x¡3=2: Maybe .x C h/2:2 is a little unusual.

Pascal's triangle can't deal with this fractional power, but the formula stays firm:

After x2:2 comes 2:2x1:2h. The complete binomial formula is in Section 10:5:

  That list is a good start, but plenty of functions are left. What comes next is really
simple. A tremendous number of new functions are "linear combinations" like

              f .x/ D 6x3 or 6x3 C 1 x2 or 6x3 ¡ 1 x2:
                                 2                                2
96  2 Derivatives

    What are their derivatives ? The answers are known for x3 and x2, and we want to
    multiply by 6 or divide by 2 or add or subtract. Do the same to the derivatives:

                f ½.x/ D 18x2 or 18x2 C x or 18x2 ¡ x:

     2C The derivative of c times f .x/ is c times f ½.x/:

     2D The derivative of f .x/ C g.x/ is f ½.x/ C g½.x/:

    The number c can be any constant. We can add (or subtract) any functions.

    The rules allow any combination of f and g: The derivative of 9f .x/ ¡ 7g.x/
    is 9f ½.x/ ¡ 7g½.x/:

      The reasoning is direct. When f .x/ is multiplied by c, so is f .x C h/: The
    difference f is also multiplied by c: All averages f = h contain c, so their limit is

    cf ½: The only incomplete step is the last one (the limit). We still have to say what

    "limit" means.
      Rule 2D is similar. Adding f C g means adding f C g: Now divide by h: In

    the limit as h 0 we reach f ½ C g½--because a limit of sums is a sum of limits.

    Any example is easy and so is the proof--it is the definition of limit that needs care
    (Section 2:6).

      You can now find the derivative of every polynomial. A "polynomial" is a

    combination of 1; x; x2; : : :; xn--for example 9 C 2x ¡ x5: That particular
    polynomial has slope 2 ¡ 5x4: Note that the derivative of 9 is zero! A constant just

    raises or lowers the graph, without changing its slope. It alters the mileage before
    starting the car.

      The disappearance of constants is one of the nice things in differential calculus. The
    reappearance of those constants is one of the headaches in integral calculus. When you
    find v from f , the starting mileage doesn't matter. The constant in f has no effect on
    v: (f is measured by a trip meter; t comes from a stopwatch.) To find distance
    from velocity, you need to know the mileage at the start.

             A LOOK AT DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS (FIND y FROM dy=dx)

    We know that y D x3 has the derivative dy=dx D 3x2: Starting with the function,
    we found its slope. Now reverse that process. Start with the slope and find the
    function. This is what science does all the time--and it seems only reasonable to say
    so.

      Begin with dy=dx D 3x2: The slope is given, the function y is not given.

    Question Can you go backward to reach y D x3 ?
    Answer Almost but not quite. You are only entitled to say that y D x3 C C: The
    constant C is the starting value of y (when x D 0). Then the differential equation
    dy=dx D 3x2 is solved.

      Every time you find a derivative, you can go backward to solve a differential
    equation. The function y D x2 C x has the slope dy=dx D 2x C 1: In reverse, the
    slope 2x C 1 produces x2 C x--and all the other functions x2 C x C C , shifted up
    and down. After going from distance f to velocity v, we return to f C C: But there
    is a lot more to differential equations. Here are two crucial points:

       1. We reach dy=dx by way of y=x, but we have no system to go backward.
           With dy=dx D .sin x/=x we are lost. What function has this derivative ?
2.2 Powers and Polynomials                                                                  97

   2. Many equations have the same solution y D x3: Economics has dy=dx D 3y=x:
       Geometry has dy=dx D 3y2=3: These equations involve y as well as dy=dx:
       Function and slope are mixed together! This is typical of differential equations.

To summarize: Chapters 2-4 compute and use derivatives. Chapter 5 goes in reverse.
Integral calculus discovers the function from its slope. Given dy=dx we find y.x/:
Then Chapter 6 solves the differential equation dy=dt D y, function mixed with slope.
Calculus moves from derivatives to integrals to differential equations.

  This discussion of the purpose of calculus should mention a specific example. Dif-
ferential equations are applied to an epidemic (like AIDS). In most epidemics the
number of cases grows exponentially. The peak is quickly reached by et , and the epi-
demic dies down. Amazingly, exponential growth is not happening with AIDS--the
best fit to the data through 1988 is a cubic polynomial (Los Alamos Science, 1989):

  The number of cases fits a cubic within 2% W y D 174:6.t ¡ 1981:2/3 C 340:

This is dramatically different from other epidemics. Instead of dy=dt D y we have
dy=dt D 3y=t: Before this book is printed, we may know what has been
preventing et (fortunately). Eventually the curve will turn away from a cubic--I hope
that mathematical models will lead to knowledge that saves lives.

  Added in proof : In 1989 the curve for the U.S. dropped from t 3 to t 2:

                  MARGINAL COST AND ELASTICITY IN ECONOMICS

First point about economics: The marginal cost and marginal income are crucially
important. The average cost of making automobiles may be $10; 000: But it is the
$8; 000 cost of the next car that decides whether Ford makes it. "The average
describes the past, the marginal predicts the future." For bank deposits or work
hours or wheat, which come in smaller units, the amounts are continuous variables.
Then the word "marginal" says one thing: Take the derivative.

   The average pay over all the hours we ever worked may be low. We wouldn't work
another hour for that! This average is rising, but the pay for each additional hour rises
faster--possibly it jumps. When $10=hour increases to $15=hour after a 40-hour
week, a 50-hour week pays $550: The average income is $11=hour. The marginal
income is $15=hour--the overtime rate.

   Concentrate next on cost. Let y.x/ be the cost of producing x tons of steel. The
cost of x C x tons is y.x C x/: The extra cost is the difference y: Divide by
x, the number of extra tons. The ratio y=x is the average cost per extra ton.
When x is an ounce instead of a ton, we are near the marginal cost dy=dx:

   Example: When the cost is x2, the average cost is x2=x D x: The marginal cost is
2x: Figure 2.4 has increasing slope--an example of "diminishing returns to scale."

   This raises another point about economics. The units are arbitrary. In yen per
kilogram the numbers look different. The way to correct for arbitrary units is to work
with percentage change or relative change. An increase of x tons is a relative
increase of x=x: A cost increase y is a relative increase of y=y: Those are
dimensionless, the same in tons=tons or dollars=dollars or yen=yen.

   A third example is the demand y at price x. Now dy=dx is negative. But again
the units are arbitrary. The demand is in liters or gallons, the price is in dollars or
pesos.

 These paragraphs show how calculus applies to economics. You do not have to be an
economist to understand them. Certainly the author is not, probably the instructor is not,
possibly the student is not. We can all use dy=dx:

    Fig. 2.4 Marginal exceeds average. Constant elasticity E D ¨1: Perfectly elastic to perfectly

                inelastic ( curve).

    Relative changes are better. When the price goes up by 10%, the demand may drop
    by 5%: If that ratio stays the same for small increases, the elasticity of demand is 21 :
                                        ¡     1
    Actually  this  number  should  be        2  :  The  price  rose,  the  demand  dropped.   In  our
    definition, the elasticity will be ¡ 21 : In conversation between economists the minus
    sign is left out (I hope not forgotten).

    DEFINITION The elasticity of the demand function y.x/ is

                            E.x/ D lim y=y D dy=dx : (3)
                                      x 0 x=x y=x

    Elasticity is "marginal" divided by "average." E.x/ is also relative change in y
    divided by relative change in x: Sometimes E.x/ is the same at all prices--this
    important case is discussed below.

    EXAMPLE 4 Suppose the demand is y D c=x when the price is x: The derivative

    dy=dx D ¡c=x2 comes from calculus. The division y=x D c=x2 is only algebra.
    The ratio is E D ¡1:

         For the demand y D c=x, the elasticity is .¡c=x2/=.c=x2/ D ¡1:

    All demand curves are compared with this one. The demand is inelastic when
                                                                                                  ¡  1
    E  1: It is elastic when E          1: The demand 20=              x    is  inelastic  .E  D     2  /,
    while x¡3 is elastic .E D ¡3/: The power y D cxn, whose derivative we know, is

    the function with constant elasticity n:

       if y D cxn then dy=dx D cnxn¡1 and E D cnxn¡1=.cxn=x/ D n:

    It is because y D cxn sets the standard that we could come so early to economics.
      In the special case when y D c=x, consumers spend the same at all prices. Price x

    times quantity y remains constant at xy D c:

    EXAMPLE 5 The supply curve has E 0--supply increases with price. Now
    the baseline case is y D cx: The slope is c and the average is y=x D c: The elasticity
    is E D c=c D 1:

      Compare E D 1 with E D 0 and E D : A constant supply is "perfectly inelastic."
    The power n is zero and the slope is zero: y D c: No more is available when the
    harvest is over. Whatever the price, the farmer cannot suddenly grow more wheat.
    Lack of elasticity makes farm economics difficult.

      The other extreme E D is "perfectly elastic." The supply is unlimited at a fixed
    price x: Once this seemed true of water and timber. In reality the steep curve

x D constant is leveling off to a flat curve y D constant. Fixed price is changing to
fixed supply, E D is becoming E D 0, and the supply of water follows a "gamma
curve" shaped like :

EXAMPLE 6 Demand is an increasing function of income--more income, more
demand. The income elasticity is E.I / D .dy=dI /=.y=I /: A luxury has E 1
(elastic). Doubling your income more than doubles the demand for caviar. A necessity
has E 1 (inelastic). The demand for bread does not double. Please recognize how
the central ideas of calculus provide a language for the central ideas of economics.

Important note on supply D demand This is the basic equation of microeconomics.
Where the supply curve meets the demand curve, the economy finds the equilibrium
price. Supply D demand assumes perfect competition. With many suppliers, no one
can raise the price. If someone tries, the customers go elsewhere.

  The opposite case is a monopoly--no competition. Instead of many small pro-
ducers of wheat, there is one producer of electricity. An airport is a monopolist (and
maybe the National Football League). If the price is raised, some demand remains.

  Price fixing occurs when several producers act like a monopoly-which antitrust
laws try to prevent. The price is not set by supply D demand. The calculus problem is
different--to maximize profit. Section 3:2 locates the maximum where the marginal
profit (the slope!) is zero.

Question on income elasticity From an income of $10; 000 you save $500:
The income elasticity of savings is E D 2: Out of the next dollar what fraction do
you save ?
Answer The savings is y D cx2 because E D 2: The number c must give 500 D

c.10; 000/2, so c is 5 ¤ 10¡6: Then the slope dy=dx is 2cx D 10 ¤ 10 ¤ 10¡6 ¤ 104 D

101 : This is the marginal savings, ten cents on the dollar. Average savings is 5%;
marginal savings is 10%; and E D 2.

                  2.3 The Slope and the Tangent Line

     Chapter 1 started with straight line graphs. The velocity was constant (at least
     piecewise). The distance function was linear. Now we are facing polynomials like

     x3 ¡ 2 or x4 ¡ x2 C 3, with other functions to come soon. Their graphs are definitely

     curved. Most functions are not close to linear--except if you focus all your attention
     near a single point. That is what we will do.

       Over a very short range a curve looks straight. Look through a microscope, or
     zoom in with a computer, and there is no doubt. The graph of distance versus time
     becomes nearly linear. Its slope is the velocity at that moment. We want to find the
     line that the graph stays closest to--the "tangent line"--before it curves away.

       The tangent line is easy to describe. We are at a particular point on the graph of

     y D f .x/: At that point x equals a and y equals f .a/ and the slope equals f ½.a/:

     The tangent line goes through that point x D a; y D f .a/ with that slope

     m D f ½.a/. Figure 2.5 shows the line more clearly than any equation, but we have to

     turn the geometry into algebra. We need the equation of the line.

     EXAMPLE 1 Suppose y D x4 ¡ x2 C 3: At the point x D a D 1, the height is
     y D f .a/ D 3: The slope is dy=dx D 4x3 ¡ 2x: At x D 1 the slope is 4 ¡ 2 D 2:

     That is f ½.a/:

            The numbers x D 1; y D 3; dy=dx D 2 determine the tangent line.

     The equation of the tangent line is y ¡ 3 D 2.x ¡ 1/, and this section explains

     why.

          Fig. 2.5 The tangent line has the same slope 2 as the curve (especially after zoom).

                                         THE EQUATION OF A LINE
     A straight line is determined by two conditions. We know the line if we know two of

     its points. (We still have to write down the equation.) Also, if we know one point and
     the slope, the line is set. That is the situation for the tangent line, which has a known
     slope at a known point:

        1. The equation of a line has the form y D mx C b
        2. The number m is the slope of the line, because dy=dx D m
        3. The number b adjusts the line to go through the required point.

     I will take those one at a time--first y D mx C b, then m, then b:
                        2.3 The Slope and the Tangent Line                                        103

1. The graph of y D mx C b is not curved. How do we know ? For the specific
example y D 2x C 1, take two points whose coordinates x; y satisfy the equation:

            x D 0; y D 1 and x D 4; y D 9 both satisfy y D 2x C 1:

Those points .0; 1/ and .4; 9/ lie on the graph. The point halfway between has x D 2
and y D 5. That point also satisfies y D 2x C 1: The halfway point is on the graph.
If we subdivide again, the midpoint between .0; 1/ and .2; 5/ is .1; 3/: This also has
y D 2x C 1: The graph contains all halfway points and must be straight.

2. What is the correct slope m for the tangent line ? In our example it is

m D f ½.a/ D 2:

  The curve and its tangent line have the same slope at the crucial point:
dy=dx D 2:

  Allow me to say in another way why the line y D mx C b has slope m: At x D 0
its height is y D b: At x D 1 its height is y D m C b: The graph has gone one unit
across .0 to 1/ and m units up .b to m C b/: The whole idea is

                               slope D distance up D m : (1)
                                         distance across 1

Each unit across means m units up, to 2m C b or 3m C b: A straight line keeps a

constant slope, whereas the slope of y D x4 ¡ x2 C 3 equals 2 only at x D 1:

3. Finally we decide on b: The tangent line y D 2x C b must go through x D 1;
y D 3: Therefore b D 1: With letters instead of numbers, y D mx C b leads to
f .a/ D ma C b: So we know b:

2E The equation of the tangent line has b D f .a/ ¡ ma:

                  y D mx C f .a/ ¡ ma or y ¡ f .a/ D m.x ¡ a/:                               (2)

That last form is the best. You see immediately what happens at x D a: The factor

x ¡ a is zero. Therefore y D f .a/ as required. This is the point-slope form of the

equation, and we use it constantly:  y ¡ 3 D distance up D slope 2:
                                     x ¡ 1 distance across
        y ¡ 3 D 2.x ¡ 1/ or

EXAMPLE 2 The curve y D x3 ¡ 2 goes through y D 6 when x D 2: At that point

dy=dx D 3x2 D 12: The point-slope equation of the tangent line uses 2 and 6 and 12:

           y ¡ 6 D 12.x ¡ 2/ which is also y D 12x ¡ 18:

There is another important line. It is perpendicular to the tangent line and

perpendicular to the curve. This is the normal line in Figure 2.6. Its new feature

is its slope. When the tangent line has slope m, the normal line has slope ¡1=m:
(Rule: Slopes of perpendicular lines multiply to give ¡1:) Example 2 has m D 12,
so the normal line has slope ¡1=12:

        tangent line: y ¡ 6 D 12.x ¡ 2/  normal  line:  y  ¡  6  D  ¡  1   .  x  ¡  2  /  :
                                                                       12

Light rays travel in the normal direction. So do brush fires--they move perpendicular
to the fire line. Use the point-slope form! The tangent is y D 12x ¡ 18, the normal is
           ¡  1      ¡
not  y  D     12  x     18:

     The same problem is solved by spacecraft controllers and baseball pitchers. Releasing
     a ball at the right time to hit a target 60 feet away is an amazing display of calculus.
     Quarterbacks with a moving target should read Chapter 4 on related rates.

       Here is a better example than a roller-coaster. Stopping at a red light wastes gas. It
     is smarter to slow down early, and then accelerate. When a car is waiting in front of
     you, the timing needs calculus:

     EXAMPLE 4 How much must you slow down when a red light is 72 meters away ?
     In 4 seconds it will be green. The waiting car will accelerate at 3 meters=sec2: You
     cannot pass the car.

     Strategy Slow down immediately to the speed V at which you will just catch that car.
     (If you wait and brake later, your speed will have to go below V:) At the catchup time
     T , the cars have the same speed and same distance. Two conditions, so the distance
     functions in Figure 2.6d are tangent.

     Solution At time T , the other car's speed is 3.T ¡ 4/: That shows the delay of 4
     seconds. Speeds are equal when 3.T ¡ 4/ D V or T D 13 V C 4: Now require equal
                                                                                           1      2:
     distances. Your distance is V      times  T:  The  other  car's  distance  is  72  C  2  at

     72        C  1  ¤  3.T  ¡  4/2  D  V  T   becomes 72 C 21 ¤ 31 V 2 D V 31 V C 4 :
                  2

     The solution is V D 12 meters=second. This is 43 km=hr or 27 miles per hour.
       Without the other car, you only slow down to V D 72=4 D 18 meters=second. As

     the light turns green, you go through at 65 km=hr or 40 miles per hour. Try it.

           THE SECANT LINE CONNECTING TWO POINTS ON A CURVE

Instead of the tangent line through one point, consider the secant line through two
points. For the tangent line the points came together. Now spread them apart. The
point-slope form of a linear equation is replaced by the two-point form.

  The equation of the curve is still y D f .x/: The first point remains at x D a;
y D f .a/: The other point is at x D c; y D f .c/: The secant line goes between them,
and we want its equation. This time we don't start with the slope--but m is easy to
find.

EXAMPLE 5 The curve y D x3 ¡ 2 goes through x D 2; y D 6: It also goes through

x D 3; y D 25: The slope between those points is

                 m D change in y D 25 ¡ 6 D 19:
                     change in x 3 ¡ 2

The point-slope form (at the first point) is y ¡ 6 D 19.x ¡ 2/: This line automatically
goes through the second point .3; 25/: Check: 25 ¡ 6 equals 19.3 ¡ 2/: The secant

has the right slope 19 to reach the second point. It is the average slope y=x.

A look ahead The second point is going to approach the first point. The secant
slope y=x will approach the tangent slope dy=dx: We discover the derivative
(in the limit). That is the main point now--but not forever.

  Soon you will be fast at derivatives. The exact dy=dx will be much easier
than y=x: The situation is turned around as soon as you know that x9 has slope
9x8: Near x D 1, the distance up is about 9 times the distance across. To find

y D 1:0019 ¡ 19, just multiply x D :001 by 9: The quick approximation is

:009, the calculator gives y D :009036: It is easier to follow the tangent line than
the curve.

  Come back to the secant line, and change numbers to letters. What line connects
x D a; y D f .a/ to x D c; y D f .c/ ? A mathematician puts formulas ahead of
numbers, and reasoning ahead of formulas, and ideas ahead of reasoning:

(1) The slope is m D distance up D f .c/ ¡ f .a/
distance across                       c¡a

(2) The height is y D f .a/ at x D a

(3) The height is y D f .c/ at x D c (automatic with correct slope).

  2F The two-point form uses the slope between the points:

           secant line W y ¡ f .a/ D f .c/ ¡ f .a/ .x ¡ a/: (3)
                                   c¡a

At x D a the right side is zero. So y D f .a/ on the left side. At x D c the right

side has two factors c ¡ a: They cancel to leave y D f .c/: With equation (2) for the

tangent line and equation (3) for the secant line, we are ready for the moment of truth.

     THE SECANT LINE APPROACHES THE TANGENT LINE

     What comes now is pretty basic. It matches what we did with velocities:

     average velocity D  distance D f .t C t / ¡ f .t /:
      time                                                t

     The limit is df =dt: We now do exactly the same thing with slopes. The secant line
     turns into the tangent line as c approaches a:

     slope of secant line:                       f D f .c/ ¡ f .a/
                                                 x        c¡a

     slope of tangent line:                      df D limit of f :
                                                 dx       x

     There stands the fundamental idea of differential calculus! You have to imagine

     more secant lines than I can draw in Figure 2.7, as c comes close to a: Everybody

     recognizes c ¡ a as x: Do you recognize f .c/ ¡ f .a/ as f .x C x/ ¡ f .x/ ? It

     is f , the change in height. All lines go through x D a; y D f .a/: Their limit is

     the tangent line.

                                                 secant   y ¡ f .a/ D f .c/ ¡ f .a/ .x ¡ a/

                                                          y ¡ f .a/ D f ½.a/.x ¡ a/

     Fig. 2.7 Secants approach tangent as their
                 slopes f =x approach df =dx:

       Intuitively, the limit is pretty clear. The two points come together, and the
     tangent line touches the curve at one point. (It could touch again at faraway points.)
     Mathematically this limit can be tricky--it takes us from algebra to calculus. Algebra
     stays away from 0=0, but calculus gets as close as it can.

       The new limit for df =dx looks different, but it is the same as before:

                         f ½.a/ D lim f .c/ ¡ f .a/: (4)
                               c a c¡a

     EXAMPLE 6 Find the secant lines and tangent line for y D f .x/ D sin x at x D 0:

     The starting point is x D 0; y D sin 0: This is the origin .0; 0/: The ratio of distance
     up to distance across is .sin c/=c:

     secant equation y D sin c x                 tangent equation y D 1x:
                                  c

     As c approaches zero, the secant line becomes the tangent line. The limit of .sin c/=c
     is not 0=0, which is meaningless, but 1; which is dy=dx:

     EXAMPLE 7 The gold you own will be worth t million dollars in t years. When
     does the rate of increase drop to 10% of the current value, so you should sell the
     gold and buy a bond ? At t D 25, how far does that put you ahead of t D 5 ?

          Solution The rate of increase is the derivative of t , which is 1=2 t : That is 10%
          of the current value t when 1=2 t D t =10: Therefore 2t D 10 or t D 5: At that
          time you sell the gold, leave the curve, and go onto the tangent line:

                                  10
          With straight interest on the bond, not compounded, you have reached
          y D 3 5 D 6:7 million dollars. The gold is worth a measly five million.

                2.4 The Derivative of the Sine and Cosine                                  109

   2.4 The Derivative of the Sine and Cosine

This section does two things. One is to compute the derivatives of sin x and cos x:

 The other is to explain why these functions are so important. They describe
oscillation, which will be expressed in words and equations. You will see a
"differential equation." It involves the derivative of an unknown function y.x/:

  The differential equation will say that the second derivative--the derivative of the

derivative--is equal and opposite to y: In symbols this is y¾ D ¡y: Distance in one

direction leads to acceleration in the other direction. That makes y and y½ and y¾ all

oscillate. The solutions to y¾ D ¡y are sin x and cos x and all their combinations.

  We begin with the slope. The derivative of y D sin x is y½ D cos x: There is no

reason for that to be a mystery, but I still find it beautiful. Chapter 1 followed a ball
around a circle; the shadow went up and down. Its height was sin t and its velocity
was cos t: We now find that derivative by the standard method of limits, when
y.x/ D sin x:

                dy D limit of y D lim sin.x C h/ ¡ sin x : (1)
                dx    x h 0     h

The sine is harder to work with than x2 or x3: Where we had .x C h/2 or .x C h/3,
we now have sin.x C h/: This calls for one of the basic "addition formulas" from
trigonometry, reviewed in Section 1:5 W

                   sin.x C h/ D sin x cos h C cos x sin h     (2)
                cos.x C h/ D cos x cos h ¡ sin x sin h:
                                                              (3)

Equation (2) puts y D sin.x C h/ ¡ sin x in a new form:

y D sin x cos h C cos x sin h ¡ sin x  D sin x cos h ¡ 1   C cos x sin h  : (4)
x               h            h                             h

The ratio splits into two simpler pieces on the right. Algebra and trigonometry got

us this far, and now comes the calculus problem. What happens as h 0 ? It is no

longer easy to divide by h: (I will not even mention the unspeakable crime of writing

.sin h/= h D sin :) There are two critically important limits--the first is zero and the

second is one:

                lim cos h ¡ 1 D 0 and lim sin h D 1: (5)
                h0 h         h0 h

 The careful reader will object that limits have not been defined! You may further
object to computing these limits separately, before combining them into equation (4).
Nevertheless--following the principle of ideas now, rigor later--I would like to
proceed. It is entirely true that the limit of (4) comes from the two limits in (5):

            dy D .sin x/.first limit/ C .cos x/.second limit/ D 0 C cos x: (6)
            dx
The secant slope y=x has approached the tangent slope dy=dx:

   2G The derivative of y D sin x is dy=dx D cos x:
110           2 Applications of the Derivative

    Fig. 2.8    We cannot pass over the crucial step--the two limits in (5). They contain the real
              ideas. Both ratios become 0=0 if we just substitute h D 0. Remember that the
              cosine of a zero angle is 1, and the sine of a zero angle is 0: Figure 2.8a shows a
              small angle h (as near to zero as we could reasonably draw). The edge of length sin h
              is close to zero, and the edge of length cos h is near 1: Figure 2.8b shows how the
              ratio of sin h to h (both headed for zero) gives the slope of the sine curve at the start.

               When two functions approach zero, their ratio might do anything. We might have

              h2  0 or  h  1 or  h              :

              h         h        h

              No clue comes from 0=0: When matters is whether the top or bottom goes to zero

              more quickly. Roughly speaking, we want to show that .cos h ¡ 1/= h is like h2= h

              and .sin h/= h is like h= h:

              Time out The graph of sin x is in Figure 2.9 (in black). The graph of sin.x C x/
              sits just beside it (in red). The height difference is f when the shift distance is x:

              Fig. 2.9 sin.x C h/ with h D 10¥ D =18 radians. f =x is close to cos x:

                Now divide by that small number x (or h). The second figure shows f =x:
              It is close to cos x: (Look how it starts--it is not quite cos x:) Mathematics will prove
              that the limit is cos x exactly, when x 0: Curiously, the reasoning concentrates
              on only one point .x D 0/: The slope at that point is cos 0 D 1:

                We now prove this: sin x divided by x goes to 1: The sine curve starts with
              slope 1: By the addition formula for sin.x C h/, this answer at one point will lead to
              the slope cos x at all points.

              Question Why does the graph of f .x C x/ shift left from f .x/ when x 0 ?
              Answer When x D 0, the shifted graph is already showing f .x/: In Figure 2.9a,
              the red graph is shifted left from the black graph. The red graph shows sin h when the
              black graph shows sin 0:

                  THE LIMIT OF .sin h/=h IS 1

              There are several ways to find this limit. The direct approach is to let a computer draw
              a graph. Figure 2.10a is very convincing. The function .sin h/= h approaches 1 at
              the key point h D 0. So does .tan h/= h: In practice, the only danger is that you might
              get a message like "undefined function" and no graph. (The machine may refuse to
              divide by zero at h D 0: Probably you can get around that.) Because of the importance
              of this limit, I want to give a mathematical proof that it equals 1:

                Figure 2.10b indicates, but still only graphically, that sin h stays below h: (The
              first graph shows that too; .sin h/= h is below 1:) We also see that tan h stays above
              h: Remember that the tangent is the ratio of sine to cosine. Dividing by the cosine is
              enough to push the tangent above h: The crucial inequalities (to be proved when h is

              small and positive) are

                 sin h h and tan h h:                                                  (7)
       2.4 The Derivative of the Sine and Cosine                                                            111

       Fig. 2.10 .sin h/= h squeezed between cos x and 1I .tan h/= h decreases to 1:

Since tan h D .sin h/=.cos h/, those are the same as

                        sin h 1 and sin h cos h: (8)
                        h                              h

What happens as h goes to zero ? The ratio .sin h/= h is squeezed between cos h
and 1. But cos h is approaching 1! The squeeze as h 0 leaves only one possibility
for .sin h/= h, which is caught in between: The ratio .sin h/= h approaches 1.

  Figure 2.10 shows that "squeeze play." If two functions approach the same limit,
so does any function caught in between. This is proved at the end of Section 2:6:

  For negative values of h, which are absolutely allowed, the result is the same. To the
left of zero, h reverses sign and sin h reverses sign. The ratio .sin h/= h is unchanged.

(The sine is an odd function: sin.¡h/ D ¡ sin h:) The ratio is an even function,

symmetric around zero and approaching 1 from both sides.
  The proof depends on sin h h tan h, which is displayed by the graph but not

explained. We go back to right triangles.

       Fig. 2.11 Line shorter than arc: 2 sin h 2h: Areas give h tan h:

    Figure 2.11a shows why sin h h: The straight line PQ has length 2 sin h: The

circular arc must be longer, because the shortest distance between two points is a

straight line. The arc PQ has length 2h: (Important: When the radius is 1, the arc

length equals the angle. The full circumference is 2 and the full angle is also 2:)

The straight distance 2 sin h is less than the circular distance 2h; so sin h h.

    Figure 2.11b shows why h tan h: This time we look at areas. The triangular area
    1                   21 .1/.tan
is  2  (base)(height)D              h/:  Inside  that  triangle  is  the  shaded  sector  of  the  circle.

 If we try to prove that, we will be here all night. Accept it as true.
112                                 2 Applications of the Derivative

     Its area is h=2 times the area of the whole circle (because the angle is that fraction

     of the whole angle). The circle has area  r2 D , so multiplication by h=2 gives
     21 h                                                                                 1          12 h:
           for  the  area  of  the  sector.  Comparing  with  the  triangle  around  it,  2  tan  h

     The inequalities sin h h tan h are now proved. The squeeze in equation (8)

     produces .sin h/= h 1: Q.E.D. Problem 13 shows how to prove sin h h from

     areas.

     Note All angles x and h are being measured in radians. In degrees, cos x is not
     the derivative of sin x. A degree is much less than a radian, and dy=dx is reduced
     by the factor 2=360:

                                    THE LIMIT OF .cos h ¡ 1/=h IS 0

     This second limit is different. We will show that 1 ¡ cos h shrinks to zero more quickly

     than h: Cosines are connected to sines by .sin h/2 C .cos h/2 D 1: We start from the

     known fact sin h h and work it into a form involving cosines:

                     .1 ¡ cos h/.1 C cos h/ D 1 ¡ .cos h/2 D .sin h/2 h2:                            (9)

     Note that everything is positive. Divide through by h and also by 1 C cos h:

                                       0 1 ¡ cos h h : (10)
                                             h                1 C cos h

     Our ratio is caught in the middle. The right side goes to zero because h 0. This

     is another "squeeze"--there is no escape. Our ratio goes to zero.

      For cos h ¡ 1 or for negative h, the signs change but minus zero is still zero. This

     confirms equation (6). The slope of sin x is cos x:

     Remark Equation (10) also shows that 1 ¡ cos h is approximately 12 h2: The

     2 comes from 1 C cos h: This is a basic purpose of calculus--to find simple

     approximations like 12 h2: A "tangent parabola" 1 ¡ 12 h2 is close to the top of the

     cosine curve.

                                    THE DERIVATIVE OF THE COSINE

     This will be easy. The quick way to differentiate cos x is to shift the sine curve by

     =2: That yields the cosine curve (solid line in Figure 2.12b). The derivative also

     shifts by =2 (dotted line). The derivative of cos x is ¡ sin x.

     Notice how the dotted line (the slope) goes below zero when the solid line

     turns downward. The slope equals zero when the solid line is level. Increasing

     functions have positive slopes. Decreasing functions have negative slopes. That

     is important, and we return to it.

     There is more information in dy=dx than "function rising" or "function falling."

     The slope tells how quickly the function goes up or down. It gives the rate of change.

     The slope of y D cos x can be computed in the normal way, as the limit of y=x:

                y D cos.x C h/ ¡ cos x  D cos x cos h ¡ 1  ¡  sin x sin h 
                x                   h                              h                         h

           dy D .cos x/.0/ ¡ .sin x/.1/ D ¡ sin x: (11)

               dx

     The first line came from formula (3) for cos.x C h/: The second line took limits,
     reaching 0 and 1 as before. This confirms the graphical proof that the slope of cos x

     is ¡ sin x:

Fig. 2.12 y.x/ increases where y½ is positive. y.x/ bends up where y¾ is positive.

THE SECOND DERIVATIVES OF THE SINE AND COSINE

We now introduce the derivative of the derivative. That is the second derivative of
the original function. It tells how fast the slope is changing, not how fast y itself is
changing. The second derivative is the "rate of change of the velocity." A straight line
has constant slope (constant velocity), so its second derivative is zero:

   f .t / D 5t has df =dt D 5 and d 2f =dt 2 D 0:

The parabola y D x2 has slope 2x (linear) which has slope 2 (constant). Similarly

f  .t  /  D  1  at  2  has  df =dt D at  and  d 2f =dt2 D a:
             2

There stands the notation d 2f =dt 2 (or d 2y=dx2) for the second derivative. A short

form is f ¾ or y¾: (This is pronounced f double prime or y double prime). Example:
The second derivative of y D x3 is y¾ D 6x:

  In the distance-velocity problem, f ¾ is acceleration. It tells how fast v is changing,

while v tells how fast f is changing. Where df =dt was distance=time, the second
derivative is distance=(time)2: The acceleration due to gravity is about 32 ft=sec2 or
9:8 m=sec2, which means that v increases by 32 ft=sec in one second. It does not
mean that the distance increases by 32 feet!

  The graph of y D sin t increases at the start. Its derivative cos t is positive.

However the second derivative is ¡ sin t: The curve is bending down while
going up. The arch is "concave down" because y¾ D ¡ sin t is negative.

  At t D  the curve reaches zero and goes negative. The second derivative becomes
positive. Now the curve bends upward. The lower arch is "concave up."

         y¾ 0 means that y½ increases so y bends upward (concave up)
         y¾ 0 means that y½ decreases so y bends down (concave down).

Chapter 3 studies these things properly--here we get an advance look for sin t:

 The remarkable fact about the sine and cosine is that y¾ D ¡y: That is unusual and
special: acceleration D ¡distance: The greater the distance, the greater the force

pulling back:

   y D sin t has dy=dt D C cos t and d 2y=dt2 D ¡ sin t D ¡y:
   y D cos t has dy=dt D ¡ sin t and d 2y=dt2 D ¡ cos t D ¡y:

Question Does d 2y=dt 2 0 mean that the distance y.t / is decreasing ?
Answer No. Absolutely not! It means that dy=dt is decreasing, not necessarily y:

At the start of the sine curve, y is still increasing but y¾ 0:

                             Sines and cosines give simple harmonic motion--up and down, forward and back,

                          out and in, tension and compression. Stretch a spring, and the restoring force pulls

                          it back. Push a swing up, and gravity brings it down. These motions are controlled

                          by a differential equation:

                                                   dt2 d D 2y ¡y: (12)

                             All solutions are combinations of the sine and cosine: y D A sin t C B cos t:

                             This is not a course on differential equations. But you have to see the purpose of

                          calculus. It models events by equations. It models oscillation by equation (12). Your

                          heart fills and empties. Balls bounce. Current alternates. The economy goes up and

                          down:         high prices high production low prices ¤ ¤ ¤

                          We can't live without oscillations (or differential equations).

     2.5 The Product and Quotient and Power Rules

     What are the derivatives of x C sin x and x sin x and 1= sin x and x= sin x and sinnx ?
     Those are made up from the familiar pieces x and sin x, but we need new rules.
     Fortunately they are rules that apply to every function, so they can be established
     once and for all. If we know the separate derivatives of two functions u and v, then
     the derivatives of u C v and uv and 1=v and u=v and un are immediately available.

       This is a straightforward section, with those five rules to learn. It is also an
     important section, containing most of the working tools of differential calculus. But I

     am afraid that five rules and thirteen examples (which we need--the eyes glaze over
     with formulas alone) make a long list. At least the easiest rule comes first. When we
     add functions, we add their derivatives.

        Sum Rule

     The derivative of the sum u.x/ C v.x/ is d .u C v/ D du C dv : (1)
                       dx                       dx dx

     EXAMPLE 1 The derivative of x C sin x is 1 C cos x: That is tremendously
     simple, but it is fundamental. The interpretation for distances may be more
     confusing (and more interesting) than the rule itself:

     Suppose a train moves with velocity 1: The distance at time t is t: On the train a
     professor paces back and forth (in simple harmonic motion). His distance from
     his seat is sin t: Then the total distance from his starting point is t C sin t , and
     his velocity (train speed plus walking speed) is 1 C cos t:

     If you add distances, you add velocities. Actually that example is ridiculous, because
     the professor's maximum speed equals the train speed .D 1/: He is running like mad,
     not pacing. Occasionally he is standing still with respect to the ground.

       The sum rule is a special case of a bigger rule called "linearity." It applies when

     we add or subtract functions and multiply them by constants--as in 3x ¡ 4 sin x:
     By linearity the derivative is 3 ¡ 4 cos x: The rule works for all functions u.x/ and

     v.x/: A linear combination is y.x/ D au.x/ C bv.x/, where a and b are any real
     numbers. Then y=x is

     au.x C x/ C bv.x C x/ ¡ au.x/ ¡ bv.x/ D a u.x C x/ ¡ u.x/ C b v.x C x/ ¡ v.x/:
     x                     x                           x

     The limit on the left is dy=dx: The limit on the right is a du=dx C b dv=dx: We are
     allowed to take limits separately and add. The result is what we hope for:

        Rule of Linearity

     The derivative of au.x/ C bv.x/ is d .au C bv/ D a du C b dv : (2)
        dx                                      dx dx

       The product rule comes next. It can't be so simple--products are not linear. The

     sum rule is what you would have done anyway, but products give something new.
     The derivative of u times v is not du=dx times dv=dx. Example: The derivative
     of x5 is 5x4: Don't multiply the derivatives of x3 and x2: (3x2 times 2x is not 5x4:)

     For a product of two functions, the derivative has two terms.

        Product Rule (the key to this section)

     The derivative of u.x/v.x/ is d .uv/ D u dv C v du : (3)
        dx                 dx dx
2.5 The Product and Quotient and Power Rules                                                     117

EXAMPLE 2 u D x3 times v D x2 is uv D x5: The product rule leads to 5x4:

x3 dv C x2 du D x3.2x/ C x2.3x2/ D 2x4 C 3x4 D 5x4:
   dx dx

EXAMPLE 3 In the slope of x sin x, I don't write dx=dx D 1 but it's there:

    d .x sin x/ D x cos x C sin x:
    dx

EXAMPLE 4 If u D sin x and v D sin x then uv D sin2x: We get two equal terms:

sin x d .sin x/ C sin x d .sin x/ D 2 sin x cos x:
dx  dx

This confirms the "square rule" 2u du=dx, when u is the same as v: Similarly the

slope of cos2x is ¡2 cos x sin x (minus sign from the slope of the cosine).

Question Those answers for sin2x and cos2x have opposite signs, so the derivative
of sin2x C cos2x is zero (sum rule). How do you see that more quickly ?

EXAMPLE 5 The derivative of uvw is uvw½ C uv½w C u½vw--one derivative at a

time. The derivative of xxx is xx C xx C xx:

Fig. 2.13 Change in length D u C v: Change in area D u v C v u C u v:

              After those examples we prove the product rule. Figure 2.13 explains it best. The
           area of the big rectangle is uv: The important changes in area are the two strips
           u v and v u. The corner area u v is much smaller. When we divide by x,
           the strips give u v=x and v u=x: The corner gives u v=x, which ap-
           proaches zero.

              Notice how the sum rule is in one dimension and the product rule is in two
           dimensions. The rule for uvw would be in three dimensions.

              The extra area comes from the whole top strip plus the side strip. By algebra,

u.x C h/v.x C h/ ¡ u.x/v.x/ D u.x C h/OEv.x C h/ ¡ v.x/ C v.x/OEu.x C h/ ¡ u.x/: (4)

           This increase is u.x C h/v C v.x/u--top plus side. Now divide by h (or x)
           and let h 0. The left side of equation (4) becomes the derivative of u.x/v.x/: The
           right side becomes u.x/ times dv=dx--we can multiply the two limits--plus v.x/
           times du=dx: That proves the product rule--definitely useful.

              We could go immediately to the quotient rule for u.x/=v.x/: But start with u D 1:

      The derivative of 1=x is ¡1=x2 (known). What is the derivative of 1=v.x/ ?

    Reciprocal Rule

The derivative of 1 is 2 ¡dv=dx : (5)v
    v.x/
118                                  2 Derivatives

     The proof starts with .v/.1=v/ D 1: The derivative of 1 is 0: Apply the product rule:

        d 1 1 dv                                      d  1  ¡dv=dx
     v                  C         D 0 so that                 D 2:             (6)
        dx v v dx                                     dx v    v

     It is worth checking the units--in the reciprocal rule and others. A test of

     dimensions is automatic in science and engineering, and a good idea in

     mathematics. The test ignores constants and plus or minus signs, but it prevents bad
     errors. If v is in dollars and x is in hours, dv=dx is in dollars per hour. Then

     dimensions agree:

     d 1                .1=dollars/  and also         ¡dv=dx  dollars=hour
     dx v                   hour                               (dollars)2 :
                                                          v2

     From this test, the derivative of 1=v cannot be 1=.dv=dx/: A similar test shows that
     Einstein's formula e D mc2 is dimensionally possible. The theory of relativity might
     be correct! Both sides have the dimension of (mass)(distance)2=(time)2, when mass

     is converted to energy.

     EXAMPLE 6 The derivatives of x¡1; x¡2; x¡n are ¡1x¡2; ¡2x¡3; ¡nx¡n¡1:

     Those come from the reciprocal rule with v D x and x2 and any xn:

         d .x¡n/ D d  1  nxn¡1 n D ¡ n 2 D ¡nx¡n¡1:
         dx                       dx x                .x /

     The beautiful thing is that this answer ¡nx¡n¡1 fits into the same pattern as xn:

     Multiply by the exponent and reduce it by one.

     For negative and positive exponents the derivative of xn is nxn¡1: (7)

     EXAMPLE 7 The derivatives of 1 and 1 are 2 C sin x and 2 ¡ cos x :
                                     cos x sin x cos x                  sin x

     Those come directly from the reciprocal rule. In trigonometry, 1= cos x is the secant
     of the angle x, and 1= sin x is the cosecant of x: Now we have their derivatives:

     d                            sin x 1 sin x
         .sec x/ D 2 D                                D sec x tan x:           (8)

  Those formulas are often seen in calculus. If you have a good memory they are
worth storing. Like most mathematicians, I have to check them every time before
using them (maybe once a year). It is really the rules that are basic, not the formulas.

  The next rule applies to the quotient u.x/=v.x/: That is u times 1=v: Combining
the product rule and reciprocal rule gives something new and important:

                  Quotient Rule

The derivative of u.x/ is 1 du ¡ u 2 dv=dx D 2 v du=dx ¡ u dv=dx :
               v.x/ v dx  v                        v

You must memorize that last formula. The v2 is familiar. The rest is new, but
not very new. If v D 1 the result is du=dx (of course). For u D 1 we have the

reciprocal rule. Figure 2.14b shows the difference .u C u/=.v C v/ ¡ .u=v/: The

denominator v.v C v/ is responsible for v2:

EXAMPLE 8 (only practice) If u=v D x5=x3 (which is x2) the quotient rule gives 2x:

            d  x5  x3.5x4/ ¡ x5.3x2/ 5x7 ¡ 3x7
               D              D     6 D 2x:
dx x3             x  6           x

EXAMPLE 9 (important) For u D sin x and v D cos x, the quotient is sin x= cos x D
tan x: The derivative of tan x is sec2x. Use the quotient rule and cos2x C sin2x D 1 W

d  sin x  cos x .cos x/ ¡ sin x .¡ sin x/ 1 2
            D                    D 2 D sec x: (11)
dx cos x          cos x2            cos x

Again to memorize: .tan x/½ D sec2x: At x D 0, this slope is 1. The graphs of sin x

and x and tan x all start with this slope (then they separate). At x D =2 the sine
curve is flat .cos x D 0/ and the tangent curve is vertical .sec2x D /:

  The slope generally blows up faster than the function. We divide by cos x, once

for the tangent and twice for its slope. The slope of 1=x is ¡1=x2: The slope is more

sensitive than the function, because of the square in the denominator.

                  d  sin x  x cos x ¡ sin x
EXAMPLE 10                D                     :
                  dx x           x  2

That one I hesitate to touch at x D 0: Formally it becomes 0=0: In reality it is more
like 03=02, and the true derivative is zero. Figure 2.10 showed graphically that .sin x/=x

is flat at the center point. The function is even (symmetric across the y axis) so its

derivative can only be zero.

  This section is full of rules, and I hope you will allow one more. It goes beyond
xn to .u.x//n: A power of x changes to a power of u.x/--as in .sin x/6 or .tan x/7

or .x2 C 1/8: The derivative contains nun¡1 (copying nxn¡1), but there is an extra

factor du=dx: Watch that factor in 6.sin x/5 cos x and 7.tan x/6sec2x and
8.x2 C 1/7.2x/:

                  Power Rule

                  h in           h in¡1 du

The derivative of u.x/ is n u.x/ dx : (12)

 For n D 1 this reduces to du=dx D du=dx: For n D 2 we get the square rule
2u du=dx: Next comes u3: The best approach is to use mathematical induction,
120                               2 Derivatives

     which goes from each n to the next power n C 1 by the product rule:

             d nC1 d n                   n du         n¡1 du                        n du

             dx  .u / D .u u/ D u C u nu                     dx       D .n C 1/u :
                  dx                     dx                                              dx

     That is exactly equation (12) for the power n C 1: We get all positive powers this way,
     going up from n D 1--then the negative powers come from the reciprocal rule.

       Figure 2.15 shows the power rule for n D 1; 2; 3: The cube makes the point
     best. The three thin slabs are u by u by u: The change in volume is essentially
     3u2u: From multiplying out .u C u/3, the exact change in volume is
     3u2u C 3u.u/2 C .u/3--which also accounts for three narrow boxes and a

     midget cube in the corner. This is the binomial formula in a picture.

     Fig. 2.15 Length change D u; area change 2uu; volume change 3u2u:

     EXAMPLE 11 d .sin x/n D n .sin x/n¡1 cos x: The extra factor cos x is du=dx:

                         dx

     Our last step finally escapes from a very undesirable restriction--that n must be

     a whole number. We want to allow fractional powers n D p=q, and keep the same
     formula. The derivative of xn is still nxn¡1.
     To deal with square roots I can write . x/2 D x: Its derivative is 2 x. x/½ D 1:
                  x/½ is 1=2                                             1
     Therefore .              x,  which  fits  the  formula  when  n  D  2  :  Now  try  n  D  p=q:

     Fractional powers Write u D xp=q as uq D xp: Take derivatives, assuming they

     exist:

                  quq¡1 du D pxp¡1             (power rule on both sides)

                           dx

                  du px¡1                      (cancel xp with uq)
                  dx D qu¡1

                  du D nxn¡1                   (replace p=q by n and u by xn)

                  dx

     EXAMPLE 12 The slope of x1=3 is 13 x¡2=3: The slope is infinite at x D 0 and

     zero at x D : But the curve in Figure 2.16 keeps climbing. It doesn't stay below an
     "asymptote."

EXAMPLE 13 The slope of x4=3 is 43 x1=3: The slope is zero at x D 0 and infinite at
x D : The graph climbs faster than a line and slower than a parabola ( 34 is between
1 and 2). Its slope follows the cube root curve (times 43 ).

  WE STOP NOW! I am sorry there were so many rules. A computer can memorize
them all, but it doesn't know what they mean and you do. Together with the chain rule
that dominates Chapter 4; they achieve virtually all the derivatives ever computed by
mankind. We list them in one place for convenience.

                                                  2.6 Limits

You have seen enough limits to be ready for a definition. It is true that we have

survived this far without one, and we could continue. But this seems a reasonable

time to define limits more carefully. The goal is to achieve rigor without rigor mortis.
  First you should know that limits of y=x are by no means the only limits in

mathematics. Here are five completely different examples. They involve n , not
x 0:

  1. an D .n ¡ 3/=.n C 3/ (for large n, ignore the 3's and find an 1)

  2. an D 21 an¡1 C 4 (start with any a1 and always a 8)

   3. an D probability of living to year n (unfortunately an 0)
   4. an D fraction of zeros among the first n digits of  .an 101 < /
   5. a1 D :4; a2 D :49; a3 D :493; : : : No matter what the remaining decimals are,

       the a's converge to a limit. Possibly an :493000 . . . , but not likely.

The problem is to say what the limit symbol                                    really means.

A good starting point is to ask about convergence to zero. When does a sequence

of positive numbers approach zero ? What does it mean to write an 0 ? The

numbers a1; a2; a3; : : : ; must become "small," but that is too vague. We will propose

four definitions of convergence to zero, and I hope the right one will be clear .

1. All the numbers an are below 10¡10. That may be enough for practical

purposes, but it certainly doesn't make the an approach zero.

2. The sequence is getting closer to zero--each anC1 is smaller than the preceding

an: This test is met by 1:1, 1:01, 1:001, . . . which converges to 1 instead of 0:

3. For any small number you think of, at least one of the an's is smaller. That

pushes something toward zero, but not necessarily the whole sequence. The condition

would  be  satisfied  by  1;  1  ;  1;  1  ;  1;  1  ;  :  :  :,  which  does  not  approach  zero.
                              2         3         4
4. For any small number you think of, the an's eventually go below that number

and stay below. This is the correct definition.

  I want to repeat that. To test for convergence to zero, start with a small number--

say 10¡10: The an's must go below that number. They may come back up and go

below again--the first million terms make absolutely no difference. Neither do the

next billion, but eventually all terms must go below 10¡10: After waiting longer
(possibly a lot longer), all terms drop below 10¡20: The tail end of the sequence

decides everything.

Question 1 Does the sequence 10¡3; 10¡2; 10¡6; 10¡5; 10¡9; 10¡8; : : :

approach 0 ?
Answer Yes, These up and down numbers eventually stay below any ":

Fig. 2.17 Convergence means: Only a finite number of a's are outside any strip around L.
124                                                          2 Derivatives

     Question 2 Does 10¡4; 10¡6; 10¡4; 10¡8; 10¡4; 10¡10; : : : approach zero ?
     Answer No. This sequence goes below 10¡4 but does not stay below.

       There is a recognized symbol for "an arbitrarily small positive number." By
     worldwide agreement, it is the Greek letter " (epsilon). Convergence to zero means
     that the sequence eventually goes below " and stays there. The smaller the ",
     the tougher the test and the longer we wait. Think of " as the tolerance, and keep

     reducing it.
       To emphasize that " comes from outside, Socrates can choose it. Whatever " he

     proposes, the a's must eventually be smaller. After some aN , all the a's are below
     the tolerance ". Here is the exact statement:

                for any " there is an N such that an " if n N:

     Once you see that idea, the rest is easy. Figure 2.17 has N D 3 and then N D 6:

     EXAMPLE 1 The sequence 21 ; 44 ; 89 ; : : : starts upward but goes to zero. Notice that
     1; 4; 9; : : :; 100; : : : are squares, and 2; 4; 8; : : :; 1024; : : : are powers of 2: Eventually
     2n grows faster than n2, as in a10 D 100=1024: The ratio goes below any ":

     EXAMPLE 2      1;  0;  1  ;  0;    1  ;  0;    :  :  :  approaches   zero.  These  a's  do  not      decrease              steadily
                            2           3

     (the mathematical word for steadily is "monotonically") but still their limit is zero.

     The choice " D 1=10 produces the right response: Beyond a2001 all terms are below

     1=1000: So N D 2001 for that ":

     The  sequence  1;  1   ;  1  ;  1  ;  1  ;  1  ;  :  :  :  is  much  slower--but  it  also  converges                  to  zero.
                        2      2     3     3     3
     Next we allow the numbers an to be negative as well as positive. They can converge

     upward toward zero, or they can come in from both sides. The test still requires the

     an to go inside any strip near zero (and stay there). But now the strip starts at ¡":

       The distance from zero is the absolute value an . Therefore an 0 means

     an 0: The previous test can be applied to an :

                for any " there is an N such that an " if n N .

     EXAMPLE 3      1;  ¡   1  ;  1  ;  ¡     1  ;  :  :  :  converges    to  zero  because  1;  1  ;  1  ;  1  ;  :  :  :  converges

     to zero.

      It is a short step to limits other than zero. The limit is L if the numbers an ¡ L
     converge to zero. Our final test applies to the absolute value an ¡ L :

               for any " there is an N such that an ¡ L " if n N .

     This is the definition of convergence! Only a finite number of a's are outside any strip
     around L (Figure 2.18). We write an L or lim an D L or limn an D L:

The distance between terms is getting smaller. But those numbers a1; a2; a3; a4; : : :

so a4 goes past 2: The eighth term has four new fractions 51 C 61 C 71 C 81 , totaling

more than 8 times 161 , so a16 is beyond 3: The lines in Figure 2.18c are infinitely
long, not stopping at any L:

In    the  language           of       Chapter        10,     the      harmonic         series     1    C   2  C  3     C    :::  does      not

converge. The sum is infinite, because the "partial sums" an go beyond every limit L

(a5000 is past L D 9). We will come back to infinite series, but this example makes a

subtle point: The steps between the an can go to zero while still an :

 Thus the condition anC1 ¡ an 0 is not sufficient for convergence. However
this condition is necessary. If we do have convergence, then anC1 ¡ an 0: That

is a good exercise in the logic of convergence, emphasizing the difference between

"sufficient" and "necessary." We discuss this logic below, after proving that [statement
A] implies [statement B]:

               If OEan converges to L then OEanC1 ¡ an converges to zero:                                                                   (1)

Proof Because the an converge, there is a number N beyond which an ¡ L "
and also anC1 ¡ L ": Since anC1 ¡ an is the sum of anC1 ¡ L and L ¡ an, its
absolute value cannot exceed " C " D 2": Therefore anC1 ¡ an approaches zero.

  Objection by Socrates: We only got below 2" and he asked for ": Our reply: If he

particularly wants anC1 ¡ an 1=10, we start with " D 1=20: Then 2" D 1=10: But

this juggling is not necessary. To stay below 2" is just as convincing as to stay below ":

                              THE LOGIC OF "IF" AND "ONLY IF"

The following page is inserted to help with the language of mathematics. In ordinary
language we might say "I will come if you call." Or we might say "I will come only
if you call." That is different! A mathematician might even say "I will come if and
only if you call." Our goal is to think through the logic, because it is important and
not so fami1iar.

   Statement A above implies statement B: Statement A is an L; statement B is

anC1 ¡ an 0: Mathematics has at least five ways of writing down A B, and

I though you might like to see them together. It seems excessive to have so many
expressions for the same idea, but authors get desperate for a little variety. Here are
the five ways that come to mind:

                                             AB

                                          A implies B

                                          if A then B

                             A is a sufficient condition for B

                                     B is true if A is true

 Logical thinking is much more important than " and i:
126                           2 Derivatives

     EXAMPLES If [positive numbers are decreasing] then [they converge to a limit].
       If [sequences an and bn converge] then [the sequence an C bn converges].
       If [f .x/ is the integral of v.x/] then [v.x/ is the derivative of f .x/].

     Those are all true, but not proved. A is the hypothesis, B is the conclusion.
       Now we go in the other direction. (It is called the "converse," not the inverse.) We

     exchange A and B. Of course stating the converse does not make it true! B might
     imply A, or it might not. In the first two examples the converse was false--the an
     can converge without decreasing, and an C bn can converge when the separate
     sequences do not. The converse of the third statement is true--and there are five
     more ways to state it:

                                                 AB

                                           A is implied by B

                                              if B then A

                                 A is a necessary condition for B

                                      B is true only if A is true

       Those words "necessary" and "sufficient" are not always easy to master. The same
     is true of the deceptively short phrase "if and only if." The two statements A B and
     A B are completely different and they both require proof. That means two sepa-
     rate proofs. But they can be stated together for convenience (when both are true):

                                AB

                                    A implies B and B implies A

                                        A is equivalent to B

                         A is a necessary and sufficient condition for B

                                  A is true if and only if B is true

                              RULES FOR LIMITS

     Calculus needs a definition of limits, to define dy=dx: That derivative contains two
     limits: x 0 and y=x dy=dx: Calculus also needs rules for limits, to prove

     the sum rule and product rule for derivatives. We started on the definition, and now

     we start on the rules.
       Given two convergent sequences, an L and bn M , other sequences also

     converge:

         Addition: an C bn L C M Subtraction: an ¡ bn L ¡ M

     Multiplication: anbn LM  Division: an=bn L=M .provided M ¤ 0/

     We check the multiplication rule, which uses a convenient identity:

           anbn ¡ LM D .an ¡ L/.bn ¡ M / C M.an ¡ L/ C L.bn ¡ M /: (2)
     Suppose an ¡ L " beyond some point N , and bn ¡ M " beyond some other

     point N ½: Then beyond the larger of N and N ½, the right side of .2/ is small. It is less

     than " ¤ " C M " C L": This proves that .2/ gives anbn LM:

       An important special case is can cL: (The sequence of b's is c; c; c; c; : : :)

     Thus a constant can be brought "outside" the limit, to give lim can D c lim an:

                        THE LIMIT OF f .x/ AS x a

The final step is to replace sequences by functions. Instead of a1; a2; : : : there is a
continuum of values f .x/: The limit is taken as x approaches a specified point a

(instead of n ). Example: As x approaches a D 0, the function f .x/ D 4 ¡ x2

approaches L D 4: As x approaches a D 2, the function 5x approaches L D 10: Those

statements are fairly obvious, but we have to say what they mean. Somehow it must

be this:

if x is close to a then f .x/ is close to L.

If x ¡ a is small, then f .x/ ¡ L should be small. As before, the word small does not

say everything. We really mean "arbitrarily small," or "below any ":" The difference

f .x/ ¡ L must become as small as anyone wants, when x gets near a: In that case

limx a f .x/ D L: Or we write f .x/ L as x a:

The statement is awkward because it involves two limits. The limit x a is forcing

f .x/ L: (Previously n  forced a L:) But it is wrong to expect the same "
in both limits. We do not and cannot require that x ¡ a " produces) f .x/ ¡ L

": It may be necessary to push x extremely close to a (closer than "). We must

guarantee that if x is close enough to a, then f .x/ ¡ L ":

  We have come to the "epsilon-delta definition" of limits. First, Socrates chooses
": He has to be shown that f .x/ is within " of L, for every x near a: Then somebody
else (maybe Plato) replies with a number i: That gives the meaning of "near a:"
Plato's goal is to get f .x/ within " of L, by keeping x within i of a:

if 0 x ¡ a i then f .x/ ¡ L ":                                                        (3)

The input tolerance is i (delta), the output tolerance is ": When Plato can find a i
for every ", Socrates concedes that the limit is L:

EXAMPLE Prove that lim 5x D 10: In this case a D 2 and L D 10:

                                       x2

Socrates asks for 5x ¡ 10 ": Plato responds by requiring x ¡ 2 i: What i should
he choose ? In this case 5x ¡ 10 is exactly 5 times x ¡ 2 : So Plato picks i below
"=5 (a smaller i is always OK). Whenever x ¡ 2 "=5, multiplication by 5 shows
that 5x ¡ 10 ":

Remark 1 In Figure 2.19, Socrates chooses the height of the box. It extends above
and below L, by the small number ": Second, Plato chooses the width. He must make

the box narrow enough for the graph to go out the sides. Then f .x/ ¡ L ":

Fig. 2.19 S chooses height 2", then P chooses width 2i: Graph must go out the sides.
128                                          2 Derivatives

       When f .x/ has a jump, the box can't hold it. A step function has no limit as x
     approaches the jump, because the graph goes through the top or bottom--no matter
     how thin the box.

     Remark 2 The second figure has f .x/ L, because in taking limits we ignore
     the final point x D a. The value f .a/ can be anything, with no effect on L: The first
     figure has more: f .a/ equals L: Then a special name applies--f is continuous. The
     left figure shows a continuous function, the other figures do not.

       We soon come back to continuous functions.

     Remark 3 In the example with f D 5x and i D "=5, the number 5 was the slope.
     That choice barely kept the graph in the box--it goes out the corners. A little narrower,
     say i D "=10, and the graph goes safely out the sides. A reasonable choice is to

     divide " by 2 f ½.a/ . (We double the slope for safety.) I want to say why this i

     works--even if the " ¡ i test is seldom used in practice.
      The ratio of f .x/ ¡ L to x ¡ a is distance up over distance across. This is f =x,

     close to the slope f ½.a/: When the distance across is i, the distance up or down is
     near i f ½.a/ : That equals "=2 for our "reasonable choice" of i--so we are safely

     below ": This choice solves most exercises. But Example 7 shows that a limit might
     exist even when the slope is infinite.

     x 1 EXAMPLE 7 limC x ¡ 1 D 0 (a one-sided limit).

     Notice the plus sign in the symbol x 1C. The number x approaches a D 1 only
     from above. An ordinary limit x 1 requires us to accept x on both sides of 1 (the
     exact value x D 1 is not considered). Since negative numbers are not allowed by the
     square root, we have a one-sided limit. It is L D 0:

       Suppose " is 1=10: Then the response could be i D 1=100: A number below 1=100
     has a square root below 1=10: In this case the box must be made extremely narrow, i
     much smaller than ", because the square root starts with infinite slope.

      Those examples show the point of the " ¡ i definition. (Given ", look for i: This

     came from Cauchy in France, not Socrates in Greece.) We also see its bad feature: The
     test is not convenient. Mathematicians do not go around proposing "'s and replying
     with i's. We may live a strange life, but not that strange.

       It is easier to establish once and for all that 5x approaches its obvious limit
     5a: The same is true for other familiar functions: xn an and sin x sin a

     and .1 ¡ x/¡1 .1 ¡ a/¡1--except at a D 1: The correct limit L comes by

     substituting x D a into the function. This is exactly the property of a "continuous
     function." Before the section on continuous functions, we prove the Squeeze
     Theorem using " and i:

       2H Squeeze Theorem Suppose f .x/ g.x/ h.x/ for x near a: If f .x/
       L and h.x/ L as x a, then the limit of g.x/ is also L:

     Proof g.x/ is squeezed between f .x/ and h.x/: After subtracting L, g.x/ ¡ L is
     between f .x/ ¡ L and h.x/ ¡ L: Therefore

             g.x/ ¡ L " if f .x/ ¡ L " and h.x/ ¡ L ":
     For any ", the last two inequalities hold in some region 0 x ¡ a i: So the first

     one also holds. This proves that g.x/ L: Values at x D a are not involved--until
     we get to continuous functions.

      2.7 Continuous Functions

This will be a brief section. It was originally included with limits, but the
combination was too long. We are still concerned with the limit of f .x/ as x a,
but a new number is involved. That number is f .a/, the value of f at x D a. For a
"limit," x approached a but never reached it--so f .a/ was ignored. For a "continuous
function," this final number f .a/ must be right.

  May I summarize the usual (good) situation as x approaches a ?

1. The number f .a/ exists    (f is defined at a)
2. The limit of f .x/ exists  (it was called L)
3. The limit L equals f .a/   (f .a/ is the right value)

In such a case, f .x/ is continuous at x D a: These requirements are often written in
a single line: f .x/ f .a/ as x a: By way of contrast, start with four functions
that are not continuous at x D 0:

      Fig. 2.20 Four types of discontinuity (others are possible) at x D 0:

  In Figure 2.20, the first function would be continuous if it had f .0/ D 0: But
it has f .0/ D 1: After changing f .0/ to the right value, the problem is gone. The
discontinuity is removable. Examples 2; 3; 4 are more important and more serious.
There is no "correct" value for f .0/:

2. f .x/ D step function (jump from 0 to 1 at x D 0)
3. f .x/ D 1=x2 (infinite limit as x 0)

4. f .x/ D sin.1=x/ (infinite oscillation as x 0).

The graphs show how the limit fails to exist. The step function has a jump

discontinuity. It has one-sided limits, from the left and right. It does not have an

ordinary (two-sided) limit. The limit from the left (x 0¡) is 0: The limit from the

right (x 0C) is 1: Another step function is x= x , which jumps from ¡1 to 1:

  In the graph of 1=x2, the only reasonable limit is L D C : I cannot go on record

as saying that this limit exists. Officially, it doesn't--but we often write it anyway:

1=x2  as x 0: This means that 1=x2 goes (and stays) above every L as x 0:

In the same unofficial way we write one-sided limits for f .x/ D 1=x:

      From the left, lim 1 D ¡ : From the right, lim 1 D C : (1)
      x 0¡ x                                              x 0C x

Remark 1=x has a "pole" at x D 0: So has 1=x2 (a double pole). The function

1=.x2 ¡ x/ has poles at x D 0 and x D 1: In each case the denominator goes to zero
and the function goes to C or ¡ : Similarly 1= sin x has a pole at every multiple
132                                          2 Derivatives

     of  (where sin x is zero). Except for 1=x2 these poles are "simple"--the functions
     are completely smooth at x D 0 when we multiply them by x:

          1                 1 1                                     1
     .x/ D 1 and .x/ 2                       D             and .x/           are continuous at x D 0:
          x                 x ¡x x¡1                                sin x

     1=x2 has a double pole, since it needs multiplication by x2 (not just x). A ratio of

     polynomials P .x/=Q.x/ has poles where Q D 0, provided any common factors like

     .x C 1/=.x C 1/ are removed first.

     Jumps and poles are the most basic discontinuities, but others can occur. The

     fourth graph shows that sin.1=x/ has no limit as x 0: This function does not blow
                                                   1       1         1
     up;  the  sine  never  exceeds  1:  At  x  D  3  and  4  and  1000  it  equals  sin  3  and  sin  4  and

     sin 1000: Those numbers are positive and negative and ( ? ). As x gets small and 1=x

     gets large, the sine oscillates faster and faster. Its graph won't stay in a small box of

     height ", no matter how narrow the box.

                                         CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

     DEFINITION f is "continuous at x D a" if f .a/ is defined and f .x/ f .a/
     as x a: If f is continuous at every point where it is defined, it is a continuous
     function.
     Objection The definition makes f .x/ D 1=x a continuous function! It is not de-
     fined at x D 0, so its continuity can't fail. The logic requires us to accept this, but we
     don't have to like it. Certainly there is no f .0/ that would make 1=x continuous at
     x D 0:

       It is amazing but true that the definition of "continuous function" is still debated
     (Mathematics Teacher, May 1989). You see the reason--we speak about a
     discontinuity of 1=x, and at the same time call it a continuous function. The definition
     misses the difference between 1=x and .sin x/=x: The function f .x/ D .sin x/=x
     can be made continuous at all x. Just set f .0/ D 1:

       We call a function "continuable" if its definition can be extended to all x in a
     way that makes it continuous. Thus .sin x/=x and x are continuable. The functions
     1=x and tan x are not continuable. This suggestion may not end the debate, but I hope
     it is helpful.

     EXAMPLE 1 sin x and cos x and all polynomials P .x/ are continuous functions.

     EXAMPLE 2 The absolute value x is continuous. Its slope jumps (not
     continuable).

     EXAMPLE 3 Any rational function P .x/=Q.x/ is continuous except where
     Q D 0:

     EXAMPLE 4 The function that jumps between 1 at fractions and 0 at non-fractions
     is discontinuous everywhere. There is a fraction between every pair of non-fractions
     and vice versa. (Somehow there are many more non-fractions.)

     EXAMPLE 5 The function 0x2 is zero for every x, except that 00 is not defined.
     So define it as zero and this function is continuous. But see the next paragraph where
     00 has to be 1:
                            2.7 Continuous Functions                                                   133

  We could fill the book with proofs of continuity, but usually the situation is clear.

"A function is continuous if you can draw its graph without lifting up your pen."

At a jump, or an infinite limit, or an infinite oscillation, there is no way across the

discontinuity except to start again on the other side. The function x¾ is continuous

for n 0: It is not continuable for n 0: The function x0 equals 1 for every x,
except that 00 is not defined. This time continuity requires 00 D 1:

  The interesting examples are the close ones--we have seen two of them:

EXAMPLE 6 sin x and 1 ¡ cos x are both continuable at x D 0:
                 x                 x

Those were crucial for the slope of sin x: The first approaches 1 and the second
approaches 0: Strictly speaking we must give these functions the correct values
(1 and 0) at the limiting point x D 0--which of course we do.

  It is important to know what happens when the denominators change to x2:

EXAMPLE 7        sin x  blows up but 2 1 ¡ cos x has the limit 1 at x D 0:x2
                  x2

Since .sin x/=x approaches 1, dividing by another x gives a function like 1=x: There
is a simple pole. It is an example of 0=0, in which the zero from x2 is reached more
quickly than the zero from sin x: The "race to zero" produces almost all interesting

problems about limits.

 For 1 ¡ cos x and x2 the race is almost even. Their ratio is 1 to 2:

      x2 1 ¡ cos x D x2.1 C cos x/ 1 ¡ cos D x2 2x sin2x ¤ 1 C cos x 1    1
                                                                        1 C 1 as x 0:

This  answer  1  will   be  found  again  (more  easily)  by            "l'Hôpital's  rule."  Here  I
              2

emphasize not the answer but the problem. A central question of differential

calculus is to know how fast the limit is approached. The speed of approach is

exactly the information in the derivative.

  These three examples are all continuous at x D 0: The race is controlled by the

slope--because f .x/ ¡ f .0/ is nearly f ½.0/ times x:

      derivative of sin x is 1            sin x decreases like x
      derivative of sin2x is 0            sin2x decreases faster than x
      derivative of x1=3 is               x1=3 decreases more slowly than x:

                                 DIFFERENTIABLE FUNCTIONS

The absolute value x is continuous at x D 0 but has no derivative. The same is true
for x1=3: Asking for a derivative is more than asking for continuity. The reason
is fundamental, and carries us back to the key definitions:

       Continuous at x: f .x C x/ ¡ f .x/ 0 as x 0
       Derivative at x: f .x C x/ ¡ f .x/ f ½.x/ as x 0:

                                             x
134                                          2 Derivatives

     In the first case, f goes to zero (maybe slowly). In the second case, f goes to
     zero as fast as x (because f =x has a limit). That requirement is stronger:

     2I At a point where f .x/ has a derivative, the function must be continuous.
     But f .x/ can be continuous with no derivative.

     Proof The limit of f D .x/.f =x/ is .0/.df =dx/ D 0: So f .x C x/ ¡

     f .x/ 0:

     The continuous function x1=3 has no derivative at x D 0, because 13 x¡2=3 blows
     up. The absolute value x has no derivative because its slope jumps. The remarkable
               1              1           C¤¤¤
     function  2  cos  3x  C  4  cos  9x        is  continuous  at  all  points  and  has  a  derivative  at

     no points. You can draw its graph without lifting your pen (but not easily--it turns

     at every point). To most people, it belongs with space-filling curves and

     unmeasurable areas--in a box of curiosities. Fractals used to go into the same box!

     They are beautiful shapes, with boundaries that have no tangents. The theory of

     fractals is very alive, for good mathematical reasons, and we touch on it in
     Section 3:7:

     I hope you have a clear idea of these basic definitions of calculus:

     1 Limit .n            or x a/ 2 Continuity (at x D a) 3 Derivative (at x D a).

     Those go back to " and i, but it is seldom necessary to follow them so far. In the same
     way that economics describes many transactions, or history describes many events,
     a function comes from many values f .x/: A few points may be special, like market
     crashes or wars or discontinuities. At other points df =dx is the best guide to the
     function.

       This chapter ends with two essential facts about a continuous function on a closed
     interval. The interval is a x b, written simply as [a; b].  At the endpoints a and
     b we require f .x/ to approach f .a/ and f .b/:

     Extreme Value Property A continuous function on the finite interval OEa; b has a
     maximum value M and a minimum value m: There are points xmax and xmin in OEa; b
     where it reaches those values:

                  f .xmax/ D M f .x/ f .xmin/ D m for all x in OEa; b:

     Intermediate Value Property If the number F is between f .a/ and f .b/, there is
     a point c between a and b where f .c/ D F: Thus if F is between the minimum m
     and the maximum M , there is a point c between xmin and xmax where f .c/ D F:

        Examples show why we require closed intervals and continuous functions. For
     0 x 1 the function f .x/ D x never reaches its minimum (zero). If we close the
     interval by defining f .0/ D 3 (discontinuous) the minimum is still not reached.
     Because of the jump, the intermediate value F D 2 is also not reached. The idea of
     continuity was inescapable, after Cauchy defined the idea of a limit.

      The interval OEa;b is closed (endpoints included). The interval (a, b) is open (a and b left
     out). The infinite interval [0, ) contains all x 0:

                              CHAPTER 3

 Applications of the Derivative

Chapter 2 concentrated on computing derivatives. This chapter concentrates on using
them. Our computations produced dy=dx for functions built from xn and sin x and
cos x. Knowing the slope, and if necessary also the second derivative, we can answer
the questions about y D f .x/ that this subject was created for:

   1. How does y change when x changes?
   2. What is the maximum value of y? Or the minimum?
   3. How can you tell a maximum from a minimum, using derivatives?
The information in dy=dx is entirely local. It tells what is happening close to
the point and nowhere else. In Chapter 2, x and y went to zero. Now we want
to get them back. The local information explains the larger picture, because y is
approximately dy=dx times x.
  The problem is to connect the finite to the infinitesimal--the average slope to the
instantaneous slope. Those slopes are close, and occasionally they are equal. Points
of equality are assured by the Mean Value Theorem--which is the local-global
connection at the center of differential calculus. But we cannot predict where dy=dx
equals y=x: Therefore we now find other ways to recover a function from its
derivatives--or to estimate distance from velocity and acceleration.
  It may seem surprising that we learn about y from dy=dx: All our work has been
going the other way! We struggled with y to squeeze out dy=dx: Now we use dy=dx
to study y: That's life. Perhaps it really is life, to understand one generation from later
generations.

                                                                                      137
138  3 Applications of the Derivative

     3.1 Linear Approximation

     The book started with a straight line f D vt: The distance is linear when the velocity
     is constant. As soon as v begins to change, f D vt falls apart. Which velocity do we
     choose, when v.t / is not constant? The solution is to take very short time intervals,
     in which v is nearly constant:

       f D vt  is completely false
     f D vt    is nearly true
     df D vdt  is exactly true

     For a brief moment the function f .t / is linear--and stays near its tangent line.

       In Section 2.3 we found the tangent line to y D f .x/: At x D a, the slope of the

     curve and the slope of the line are f ½.a/: For points on the line, start at y D f .a/:

     Add the slope times the "increment" x ¡ a:

     Y D f .a/ C f ½.a/.x ¡ a/:                                                          (1)

     We write a capital Y for the line and a small y for the curve. The whole point of
     tangents is that they are close .provided we don't move too far from a/:

     y Y or f .x/ f .a/ C f ½.a/.x ¡ a/:                                                 (2)

     That is the all-purpose linear approximation. Figure 3.1 shows the square root
     function y D x and its tangent line at x D a D 100: At the point y D 100 D 10,
     the slope is 1=2 x D 1=20: The table beside the figure compares y.x/ with Y .x/:

                                                                                   x Y yD x

                                                                                 110 10:5 10:49

                                                                                 400 25 20

      Fig. 3.1 Y.x/ is the linear approximation to x near x D a D 100:

     The accuracy gets worse as x departs from 100: The tangent line leaves the curve.
     The arrow points to a good approximation at 102, and at 101 it would be even better.
     In this example Y is larger than y--the straight line is above the curve. The slope
     of the line stays constant, and the slope of the curve is decreasing. Such a curve will
     soon be called "concave downward," and its tangent lines are above it.

       Look again at x D 102, where the approximation is good. In Chapter 2, when we
     were approaching dy=dx, we started with y=x:

                          slope 102¡ 100 : (3)
                                  102 ¡ 100
3.1 Linear Approximation                                                                139

Now that is turned around! The slope is 1=20: What we don't know is 102:

102 100C (slope).102 ¡ 100/:                                                 (4)

You work with what you have. Earlier we didn't know dy=dx, so we used .3/: Now

we are experts at dy=dx, and we use .4/: After computing y½ D 1=20 once and for

all, the tangent line stays near x for every number near 100: When that nearby
number is 100 C x, notice the error as the approximation is squared:

 100 C 1 2 x D 100 C x C 1 .x/2:
20                          400

The desired answer is 100 C x, and we are off by the last term involving .x/2:
The whole point of linear approximation is to ignore every term after x:

  There is nothing magic about x D 100, except that it has a nice square root. Other
points and other functions allow y Y: I would like to express this same idea in
different symbols. Instead of starting from a and going to x, we start from x and go
a distance x to x C x. The letters are different but the mathematics is identical.

                                                   x
For the approximation to f .x C x/, multiply both sides by x and add f .x/:

EXAMPLE 1 An important linear approximation: .1 C x/n 1 C nx for x near zero.

EXAMPLE 2 A second important approximation: 1=.1 C x/n 1 ¡ nx for x near zero.
Discussion Those are really the same. By changing n to ¡n in Example 1, it
becomes Example 2. These are linear approximations using the slopes n and ¡n
at x D 0: .1 C x/n 1 C .slope at zero/ times .x ¡ 0/ D 1 C nx:

Here is the same thing with f .x/ D xn: The basepoint in equation (6) is now 1 or x:

            .1 C x/n 1 C nx .x C x/n xn C nxn¡1x:

Better than that, here are numbers. For n D 3 and ¡1 and 100, take x D :01:

.1:01/3 1:03   1             1 100

                                100
              1:01

Actually that last number is no good. The 100th power is too much. Linear
approximation gives 1 C 100x D 2, but a calculator gives .1:01/100 D 2:7 : : :: This
is close to e, the all-important number in Chapter 6. The binomial formula shows why

Linear approximation forgets the .x/2 term. For x D 1=100 that error is nearly

                                                DIFFERENTIALS

     There is one more notation for this linear approximation. It has to be presented,
     because it is often used. The notation is suggestive and confusing at the same time--it
     keeps the same symbols dx and dy that appear in the derivative. Earlier we
     took great pains to emphasize that dy=dx is not an ordinary fraction. Until this
     paragraph, dx and dy have had no independent meaning. Now they become
     separate variables, like x and y but with their own names. These quantities dx and dy
     are called differentials.

       The symbols dx and dy measure changes along the tangent line. They do for the
     approximation Y .x/ exactly what x and y did for y.x/: Thus dx and x both
     measure distance across.

       Figure 3.2 has x D dx: But the change in y does not equal the change in Y:
     One is y (exact for the function). The other is dy (exact for the tangent line). The
     differential dy is equal to Y , the change along the tangent line. Where y is
     the true change, dy is its linear approximation .dy=dx/dx:

       You often see dy written as f ½.x/dx:

                          y D change in y (along curve)

                          dy D change in Y (along tangent)

                          Fig. 3.2  The linear approximation to y is

                                             dy D f ½.x/dx:

     EXAMPLE 3 y D x2 has dy=dx D 2x so dy D 2xdx: The table has basepoint
     x D 2: The prediction dy differs from the true y by exactly .x/2 D :01 and :04

     and :09:

      y D x2   dx dy      x y       y D .2 C x/2 ¡ 22
     dy D 4dx  .1 0.4      .1 0.41
               .2 0.8      .2 0.84  y D 4x C .x/2
               .3 1.2      .3 1.29

       The differential dy D f ½.x/dx is consistent with the derivative dy=dx D f ½.x/:

     We finally have dy D .dy=dx/dx, but this is not as obvious as it seems! It looks like
     cancellation--it is really a definition. Entirely new symbols could be used, but dx and

     dy have two advantages: They suggest small steps and they satisfy dy D f ½.x/dx:

     Here are three examples and three rules:

       d.xn/ D nxn¡1dx    d.f C g/ D df C dg
                             d.cf / D c df
     d.sin x/ D cos x dx     d.fg/ D f dg C g df
     d.tan x/ D sec2x dx

        Science and engineering and virtually all applications of mathematics depend on
     linear approximation. The true function is "linearized," using its slope v:

      Fraction or not, it is absolutely forbidden to cancel the d 's
                       3.1 Linear Approximation                                            141

            Increasing the time by t increases the distance by vt

            Increasing the force by f increases the deflection by vf

            Increasing the production by p increases its value by vp:

The goal of dynamics or statics or economics is to predict this multiplier v--the
derivative that equals the slope of the tangent line. The multiplier gives a local
prediction of the change in the function. The exact law is nonlinear--but Ohm's law
and Hooke's law and Newton's law are linear approximations.

       ABSOLUTE CHANGE, RELATIVE CHANGE, PERCENTAGE CHANGE

The change y or f can be measured in three ways. So can x:

                 Absolute change    f                       x
                 Relative change
                 Percentage change   f                      x
                                    f .x/                    x

                                    f ¢ 100                 x ¢100

                                    f .x/                    x

Relative change is often more realistic than absolute change. If we know the distance

to the moon within three miles, that is more impressive than knowing our own height

within one inch. Absolutely, one inch is closer than three miles. Relatively, three miles

is much closer:

                     3 miles      1 inch                           1:4%:

One comment on d V D 4 r2dr: This is (area of sphere) times (change in radius).
It is the volume of a thin shell around the sphere. The shell is added when the radius
grows by dr: The exact V =V is 3917312=640000%; but calculus just calls it 6%:

           3.2 Maximum and Minimum Problems

Our goal is to learn about f .x/ from df =dx: We begin with two quick questions.
If df =dx is positive, what does that say about f ? If the slope is negative, how is that
reflected in the function? Then the third question is the critical one:

How do you identify a maximum or minimum?
Normal answer: The slope is zero.

This may be the most important application of calculus, to reach df =dx D 0:
  Take the easy questions first. Suppose df =dx is positive for every x between

a and b: All tangent lines slope upward. The function f .x/ is increasing as x goes
from a to b.

  3B If df =dx 0 then f .x/ is increasing. If df =dx 0 then f .x/
  is decreasing.

To define increasing and decreasing, look at any two points x X: "Increasing"
requires f .x/ f .X /: "Decreasing" requires f .x/ f .X /: A positive slope does
not mean a positive function. The function itself can be positive or negative.

EXAMPLE 1 f .x/ D x2 ¡ 2x has slope 2x ¡ 2: This slope is positive when x 1

and negative when x 1: The function increases after x D 1 and decreases before
x D 1:

       Fig. 3.3 Slopes are ¡ C: Slope is C¡ C¡ C so f is up-down-up-down-up.

We say that without computing f .x/ at any point! The parabola in Figure 3.3 goes
down to its minimum at x D 1 and up again.

EXAMPLE 2 x2 ¡ 2x C 5 has the same slope. Its graph is shifted up by 5, a
number that disappears in df =dx: All functions with slope 2x ¡ 2 are parabolas
x2 ¡ 2x C C , shifted up or down according to C: Some parabolas cross the x axis

(those crossings are solutions to f .x/ D 0/: Other parabolas stay above the axis. The

solutions to x2 ¡ 2x C 5 D 0 are complex numbers and we don't see them. The
special parabola x2 ¡ 2x C 1 D .x ¡ 1/2 grazes the axis at x D 1: It has a "double

zero," where f .x/ D df =dx D 0:
144                             3 Applications of the Derivative

     EXAMPLE 3 Suppose df =dx D .x ¡ 1/.x ¡ 2/.x ¡ 3/.x ¡ 4/: This slope is

     positive beyond x D 4 and up to x D 1 (df =dx D 24 at x D 0). And df =dx is
     positive again between 2 and 3: At x D 1; 2; 3; 4, this slope is zero and f .x/
     changes direction.

       Here f .x/ is a fifth-degree polynomial, because f ½.x/ is fourth-degree. The graph

     of f goes up-down-up-down-up. It might cross the x axis five times. It must cross
     at least once (like this one). When complex numbers are allowed, every fifth-degree
     polynomial has five roots.

       You may feel that "positive slope implies increasing function" is obvious--perhaps
     it is. But there is still something delicate. Starting from df =dx 0 at every single
     point, we have to deduce f .X / f .x/ at pairs of points. That is a "local to global"
     question, to be handled by the Mean Value Theorem. It could also wait for the

     Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: The difference f .X / ¡ f .x/ equals the area

     under the graph of df =dx. That area is positive, so f .X / exceeds f .x/:

                                             MAXIMA AND MINIMA

     Which x makes f .x/ as large as possible? Where is the smallest f .x/? Without
     calculus we are reduced to computing values of f .x/ and comparing. With calculus,
     the information is in df =dx:

       Suppose the maximum or minimum is at a particular point x: It is possible that
     the graph has a corner--and no derivative. But if df =dx exists, it must be zero. The
     tangent line is level. The parabolas in Figure 3.3 change from decreasing to increasing.
     The slope changes from negative to positive. At this crucial point the slope is zero.

     3C Local Maximum or Minimum Suppose the maximum or minimum
     occurs at a point x inside an interval where f .x/ and df =dx are defined. Then

     f ½.x/ D 0:

     The word "local" allows the possibility that in other intervals, f .x/ goes higher or

     lower. We only look near x, and we use the definition of df =dx:

      Start with f .x C x/ ¡ f .x/: If f .x/ is the maximum, this difference is negative

     or zero. The step x can be forward or backward:

     if x 0 W f .x C x/ ¡ f .x/ D negative 0 and in the limit df 0:
     x  positive                                      dx

     if x 0 W f .x C x/ ¡ f .x/ D negative 0 and in the limit df 0:
     x  negative                                      dx

     Both arguments apply. Both conclusions df =dx 0 and df =dx 0 are correct. Thus
     df =dx D 0:

       Maybe Richard Feynman said it best. He showed his friends a plastic curve that
     was made in a special way--"no matter how you turn it, the tangent at the lowest
     point is horizontal." They checked it out. It was true.

       Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! is a good book (but rough on
     mathematicians).

     EXAMPLE 3 (continued) Look back at Figure 3.3b. The points that stand out
     are not the "ups" or "downs" but the "turns." Those are stationary points, where
     df =dx D 0: We see two maxima and two minima. None of them are absolute

     maxima or minima, because f .x/ starts at ¡ and ends at C :

EXAMPLE 4 f .x/ D 4x3 ¡ 3x4 has slope 12x2 ¡ 12x3: That derivative is zero

when x2 equals x3, at the two points x D 0 and x D 1: To decide between minimum
and maximum (local or absolute), the first step is to evaluate f .x/ at these stationary
points. We find f .0/ D 0 and f .1/ D 1:

 Now look at large x: The function goes down to ¡ in both directions. (You can
mentally substitute x D 1000 and x D ¡1000). For large x; ¡3x4 dominates 4x3:

Conclusion f D 1 is an absolute maximum. f D 0 is not a maximum or minimum
(local or absolute). We have to recognize this exceptional possibility, that a curve (or a

car) can pause for an instant .f ½ D 0/ and continue in the same direction. The reason

is the "double zero" in 12x2 ¡ 12x3, from its double factor x2:

Important The maximum always occurs at a stationary point (where df =dx D 0)
or a rough point (no derivative) or an endpoint of the domain. These are the three
types of critical points. All maxima and minima occur at critical points! At every
other point df =dx 0 or df =dx 0: Here is the procedure:

    1. Solve df =dx D 0 to find the stationary points f .x/:
    2. Compute f .x/ at every critical point--stationary point, rough point,

       endpoint.
    3. Take the maximum and minimum of those critical values of f .x/:

EXAMPLE 6 (Absolute value f .x/ D x ) The minimum is zero at a rough point.
The maximum is at an endpoint. There are no stationary points.

  The derivative of y D x is never zero. Figure 3.4 shows the maximum and

minimum on the interval OE¡3; 2: This is typical of piecewise linear functions.

Question Could the minimum be zero when the function never reaches f .x/ D 0?
Answer Yes, f .x/ D 1=.1 C x/2 approaches but never reaches zero as x :

 A good word is approach when f .x/                : Infinity is not reached. But I still say "the
maximum is :"
146                       3 Applications of the Derivative

     Remark 1 x ¨ and f .x/ ¨ are avoided when f is continuous on a

     closed interval a x b: Then f .x/ reaches its maximum and its minimum

     (Extreme Value Theorem). But x  and f .x/  are too important to rule out.

     You test x  by considering large x: You recognize f .x/         by going above

     every finite value.

     Remark 2 Note the difference between critical points (specified by x) and critical

     values (specified by f .x/). The example x C x¡1 had the minimum point x D 1 and

     the minimum value f .1/ D 2:

                             MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM IN APPLICATIONS

     To find a maximum or minimum, solve f ½.x/ D 0: The slope is zero at the top and

     bottom of the graph. The idea is clear--and then check rough points and endpoints.
     But to be honest, that is not where the problem starts.

       In a real application, the first step (often the hardest) is to choose the unknown
     and find the function. It is we ourselves who decide on x and f .x/: The equation
     df =dx D 0 comes in the middle of the problem, not at the beginning. I will start on a
     new example, with a question instead of a function.

     EXAMPLE 7 Where should you get onto an expressway for minimum driving time,
     if the expressway speed is 60 mph and ordinary driving speed is 30 mph?

     I know this problem well--it comes up every morning. The Mass Pike goes to MIT
     and I have to join it somewhere. There is an entrance near Route 128 and another
     entrance further in. I used to take the second one, now I take the first. Mathematics
     should decide which is faster--some mornings I think they are maxima.

       Most models are simplified, to focus on the key idea. We will allow the expressway
     to be entered at any point x (Figure 3.5). Instead of two entrances (a discrete problem)
     we have a continuous choice (a calculus problem). The trip has two parts, at speeds
     30 and 60:

               a distance a2 C x2 up to the expressway, in a2 C x2=30 hours

           a distance b ¡ x on the expressway, in .b ¡ x/=60 hours

     Problem Minimize f .x/ D total time D 1 a2 C x2 C 1 .b ¡ x/:
                                     30                          60

     We have the function f .x/: Now comes calculus. The first term uses the power rule:

     The derivative of u1=2 is 12 u¡1=2 du=dx: Here u D a2 C x2 has du=dx D 2x:

                          f ½.x/ D 1 1 .a2 C x2/¡1=2.2x/ ¡ 1 : (1)
                          30 2                                   60

     To solve f ½.x/ D 0, multiply by 60 and square both sides:

     .a2 C x2/¡1=2.2x/ D 1 gives 2x D .a2 C x2/1=2 and 4x2 D a2 C x2: (2)

     Thus 3x2 D a2: This yields two candidates, x D a= 3 and x D ¡a= 3: But a

     negative x would mean useless driving on the expressway. In fact f ½ is not zero

     at x D ¡a= 3: That false root entered when we squared 2x:
3.2 Maximum and Minimum Problems                                                        147

Fig. 3.5 Join the freeway at x--minimize the driving time f .x/:

  I notice something surprising. The stationary point x D a= 3 does not depend on
b: The total time includes the constant b=60, which disappeared in df =dx: Somehow
b must enter the answer, and this is a warning to go carefully. The minimum might
occur at a rough point or an endpoint. Those are the other critical points of f , and
our drawing may not be realistic. Certainly we expect x b, or we are entering the

expressway beyond MIT.
  Continue with calculus. Compute the driving time f .x/ for an entrance at

x¦ D a= 3:

12 2  1  a  3a b ¦
f .x/ D 30 a C .a =3/ C 60 b ¡ 3 D 60 C 60 D f :

The square root of 4a2=3 is 2a= 3: We combined 2=30 ¡ 1=60 D 3=60 and divided

by 3: Is this stationary value f ¦ a minimum? You must look also at endpoints:

               enter at x D 0: travel time is a=30 C b=60 D f ¦¦
               enter at x D b: travel time is a2 C b2=30 D f ¦¦¦:

The comparison f ¦ f ¦¦ should be automatic. Entering at x D 0 was a candidate

and calculus didn't choose it. The derivative is not zero at x D 0: It is not smart to
go perpendicular to the expressway.

  The second comparison has x D b: We drive directly to MIT at speed 30: This
option has to be taken seriously. In fact it is optimal when b is small or a is large.

  This choice x D b can arise mathematically in two ways. If all entrances are
between 0 and b, then b is an endpoint. If we can enter beyond MIT, then b is a
rough point. The graph in Figure 3.5c has a corner at x D b, where the derivative

jumps. The reason is that distance on the expressway is the absolute value b ¡ x --

never negative.
  Either way x D b is a critical point. The optimal x is the smaller of a= 3

and b.

     if a= 3 b W stationary point wins, enter at x D a= 3; total time f ¦
     if a= 3 b W no stationary point, drive directly to MIT, time f ¦¦¦

The heart of this subject is in "word problems." All the calculus is in a few lines,

computing f ½ and solving f ½.x/ D 0: The formulation took longer. Step 1 usually

does:

1. Express the quantity to be minimized or maximized as a function f .x/:
   The variable x has to be selected.
148                        3 Applications of the Derivative

       2. Compute f ½.x/, solve f ½.x/ D 0, check critical points for fmin and fmax:

     A picture of the problem (and the graph of f .x/) makes all the difference.

     EXAMPLE 7 (continued) Choose x as an angle instead of a distance. Figure 3.6

     shows the triangle with angle x and side a: The driving distance to the expressway

     is a sec x: The distance on the expressway is b ¡ a tan x: Dividing by the speeds 30

     and 60, the driving time has a nice form:
                           f .x/ D total time D a sec x C b ¡ a tan x : (3)
                                                      30                   60

     The derivatives of sec x and tan x go into df =dx:

                                df D a sec x tan x ¡ a sec2x: (4)
                                dx 30                           60

     Now set df =dx D 0, divide by a, and multiply by 30cos2x:

                                             sin  x  D    1  :                          (5)
                                                          2

     This answer is beautiful. The angle x is 30¥! That optimal angle (=6 radians)

     has sin x D 21 : The triangle with side a and hypotenuse a= 3 is a 30-60-90 right
     triangle.

       I don't know whether you prefer a2 C x2 or trigonometry. The minimum is

     exactly as before--either at 30¥ or going directly to MIT.

     Fig. 3.6 (a) Driving at angle x: (b) Energies of spring and mass. (c) Profit D income ¡ cost.

     EXAMPLE 8 In mechanics, nature chooses minimum energy. A spring is pulled
     down by a mass, the energy is f .x/, and df =dx D 0 gives equilibrium. It is a

     philosophical question why so many laws of physics involve minimum energy or

     minimum time--which makes the mathematics easy.

     1  The energy has two terms--for the spring and the mass. The spring energy is
     2
        kx2--positive  in  stretching   (x   0 is downward) and also positive in compression
     .x 0/: The potential energy of the mass is taken as ¡mx--decreasing as the mass
                                                                     D  1  kx2  ¡
     goes  down.  The  balance  is  at  the  minimum  of  f     .x/     2          mx:

        I apologize for giving you such a small problem, but it makes a crucial point.

     When f .x/ is quadratic, the equilibrium equation df =dx D 0 is linear.

                                        df =dx D kx ¡ m D 0:

     Graphically, x D m= k is at the bottom of the parabola. Physically, kx D m is a
     balance of forces--the spring force against the weight. Hooke's law for the spring
     force is elastic constant k times displacement x:

EXAMPLE 9 Derivative of cost D marginal cost (our first management
example).

The paper to print x copies of this book might cost C D 1000 C 3x dollars. The
derivative is dC =dx D 3: This is the marginal cost of paper for each additional book.
If x increases by one book, the cost C increases by $3: The marginal cost is like the
velocity and the total cost is like the distance.

  Marginal cost is in dollars per book. Total cost is in dollars. On the plus
side, the income is I.x/ and the marginal income is dI =dx: To apply calculus, we
overlook the restriction to whole numbers.

  Suppose the number of books increases by dx: The cost goes up by
.dC =dx/dx: The income goes up by .dI =dx/ dx: If we skip all other costs, then

profit P .x/ D income I.x/¡ cost C.x/. In most cases P increases to a maximum

and falls back.
  At the high point on the profit curve, the marginal profit is zero:

                        dP =dx D 0 or dI =dx D dC=dx:                                                    (6)

Profit is maximized when marginal income I ½ equals marginal cost C ½.

This basic rule of economics comes directly from calculus, and we give an example:

                        C.x/D cost of x advertisements D 900 C 400x ¡ x2

                                 setup cost 900, print cost 400x; volume savings x2

                        I.x/D income due to x advertisements D 600x ¡ 6x2

                                 sales 600 per advertisement, subtract 6x2 for diminishing returns

The next section shows how to verify that this profit is a maximum not a minimum.

for f .x/:

3.3 Second Derivatives: Bending and Acceleration

When f ½.x/ is positive, f .x/ is increasing. When dy=dx is negative, y.x/ is

decreasing. That is clear, but what about the second derivative? From looking at the

curve, can you decide the sign of f ¾.x/ or d 2y=dx2? The answer is yes and the key

is in the bending.

A straight line doesn't bend. The slope of y D mx C b is m(a constant). The second

derivative is zero. We have to go to curves, to see a changing slope. Changes in the

derivative show up in f ¾.x/:

f D x2 has f ½ D 2x and f ¾ D 2 (this parabola bends up)

y D sin x has dy=dx D cos x and d 2y=dx2 D ¡ sin x (the sine bends down)

The slope 2x gets larger even when the parabola is falling. The sign of f or f ½ is
not revealed by f ¾: The second derivative tells about change in slope.
A function with f ¾.x/ 0 is concave up. It bends upward as the slope increases.
It is also called convex. A function with decreasing slope--this means f ¾.x/ 0--is
                                                                              1
concave   down.  Note    how  cos    x  and   1  C  cos  x   and  even  1  C  2  x  C  cos  x  change  from
concave down to concave up at x D =2: At that point f ¾ D ¡ cos x changes from
                                           1
negative  to  positive.  The  extra  1  C  2  x  tilts  the  graph  but  the  bending  is   the  same.

Fig. 3.7 Increasing slope D concave up .f ¾ 0/: Concave down is f ¾ 0: Inflection point f ¾ D 0

      Here is another way to see the sign of f ¾: Watch the tangent lines.When the

     curve is concave up, the tangent stays below it. A linear approximation is too low.
     This section computes a quadratic approximation--which includes the term with

    f ¾ 0: When the curve bends down .f ¾ 0/, the opposite happens--the tangent
    lines are above the curve. The linear approximation is too high, and f ¾ lowers it.

      In physical motion, f ¾.t / is the acceleration--in units of distance=.time/2:

     Acceleration is rate of change of velocity. The oscillation sin 2t has v D 2 cos 2t

   (maximum speed 2) and a D ¡4 sin 2t (maximum acceleration 4).

      An increasing population means f ½ 0: An increasing growth rate means
    f ¾ 0. Those are different. The rate can slow down while the growth continues.

                                            MAXIMUM VS. MINIMUM

    Remember that f ½.x/ D 0 locates a stationary point. That may be a minimum or

     a maximum. The second derivative decides! Instead of computing f .x/ at many

    points, we compute f ¾.x/ at one point--the stationary point. It is a minimum if
    f ¾.x/ 0:
154                                    3 Applications of the Derivative

        3D When f ½.x/ D 0 and f ¾.x/ 0, there is a local minimum at x:
           When f ½.x/ D 0 and f ¾.x/ 0, there is a local maximum at x:

     To the left of a minimum, the curve is falling. After the minimum, the curve rises. The

     slope has changed from negative to positive. The graph bends upward and f ¾.x/ 0:

       At a maximum the slope drops from positive to negative. In the exceptional case,

     when f ½.x/ D 0 and also f ¾.x/ D 0, anything can happen. An example is x3, which

     pauses at x D 0 and continues up (its slope is 3x2 0). However x4 pauses and goes
     down (with a very flat graph).

       We emphasize that the information from f ½.x/ and f ¾.x/ is only "local." To be

     certain of an absolute minimum or maximum, we need information over the whole

     domain.

     EXAMPLE 1 f .x/ D x3 ¡ x2 has f ½.x/ D 3x2 ¡ 2x and f ¾.x/ D 6x ¡ 2:

     To find the maximum and=or minimum, solve 3x2 ¡ 2x D 0: The stationary points
                                 2                                                                           ¾.0/     ¡2
     are   x  D  0  and    x  D  3  .  At  those  points  we  need     the   second  derivative.  It  is  f        D
     (local maximum) and f ¾ 32  D C2 (local minimum).
        Between the maximum and minimum is the inflection point. That is where
     f ¾.x/ D 0. The curve changes from concave down to concave up. This example has
        ¾           ¡                                                  1

                                                  INFLECTION POINTS

     In mathematics it is a special event when a function passes through zero. When the

     function is f , its graph crosses the axis. When the function is f ½, the tangent line is
     horizontal. When f ¾ goes through zero, we have an inflection point.

       The direction of bending changes at an inflection point. Your eye picks that out

     in a graph. For an instant the graph is straight (straight lines have f ¾ D 0). It is easy

     to see crossing points and stationary points and inflection points. Very few people can

     recognize where f ¿ D 0 or f D 0: I am not sure if those points have names.
       There is a genuine maximum or minimum when f ½.x/ changes sign. Similarly,

     there is a genuine inflection point when f ¾.x/ changes sign. The graph is concave

     down on one side of an inflection point and concave up on the other side.
     The tangents are above the curve on one side and below it on the other side. At an
     inflection point, the tangent line crosses the curve (Figure 3.7b).

       Notice that a parabola y D ax2 C bx C c has no inflection points: y¾ is constant.
     A cubic curve has one inflection point, because f ¾ is linear. A fourth-degree curve
     might or might not have inflection points--the quadratic f ¾.x/ might or might not

     cross the axis.

     EXAMPLE 2 x4 ¡ 2x2 is W-shaped, 4x3 ¡ 4x has two bumps, 12x2 ¡ 4 is U-shaped.

     The table shows the signs at the important values of x:

                         x             ¡ 2 ¡1 ¡1= 3 0 1= 3 1 2

                         f ¾.x/                               0 ¡0

      That rules out f .x/ D x4, which has f ¾ D 12x2 0 on both sides of zero. Its tangent line

     is the x axis. The line stays below the graph--so no inflection point

        Between zeros of f .x/ come zeros of f ½.x/ (stationary points). Between zeros of
        f ½.x/ come zeros of f ¾.x/ (inflection points). In this example f .x/ has a double
        zero at the origin, so a single zero of f ½ is caught there. It is a local maximum, since
        f ¾.0/ 0:

          Inflection points are important--not just for mathematics. We know the world
        population will keep rising. We don't know if the rate of growth will slow down.
        Remember: The rate of growth stops growing at the inflection point. Here is the
        1990 report of the UN Population Fund.

              The next ten years will decide whether the world population trebles or merely
           doubles before it finally stops growing. This may decide the future of the earth as a
           habitation for humans. The population, now 5:3 billion, is increasing by a quarter
           of a million every day. Between 90 and 100 million people will be added every
           year during the 1990s; a billion people--a whole China--over the decade. The
           fastest growth will come in the poorest countries.

              A few years ago it seemed as if the rate of population growth was slowing
           everywhere except in Africa and parts of South Asia. The world's population
           seemed set to stabilize around 10:2 billion towards the end of the next century.

              Today, the situation looks less promising. The world has overshot the marker
           points of the 1984 "most likely" medium projection. It is now on course for an
           eventual total that will be closer to 11 billion than to 10 billion.

              If fertility reductions continue to be slower than projected, the mark could be
           missed again. In that case the world could be headed towards a total of up to 14
           billion people.

          Starting with a census, the UN follows each age group in each country. They
        estimate the death rate and fertility rate--the medium estimates are published. This
        report is saying that we are not on track with the estimate.

          Section 6.5 will come back to population, with an equation that predicts 10 billion.
        It assumes we are now at the inflection point. But China's second census just started
        on July 1, 1990: When it's finished we will know if the inflection point is still ahead.

          You now understand the meaning of f ¾.x/:Its sign gives the direction of bending--

        the change in the slope. The rest of this section computes how much the curve

        bends--using the size of f ¾ and not just its sign. We find quadratic approximations
        based on f ¾.x/: In some courses they are optional--the main points are highlighted.

           CENTERED DIFFERENCES AND SECOND DIFFERENCES

        Calculus begins with average velocities, computed on either side of x:

           f .x C x/ ¡ f .x/ and f .x/ ¡ f .x ¡ x/ are close to f ½.x/ (1)
              x     x

        We never mentioned it, but a better approximation to f ½.x/ comes from averaging

        those two averages. This produces a centered difference, which is based on x C x

        and x ¡ x: It divides by 2x:

f ½.x/  1  f .x C x/ ¡ f .x/ C f .x/ ¡ f .x ¡ x/ D f .x C x/ ¡ f .x ¡ x/: (2)
        2  x     x                                                      2x

        We claim this is better. The test is to try it on powers of x:

         The United Nations watches the second derivative!
156                    3 Applications of the Derivative

          For f .x/ D x these ratios all give f ½ D 1 (exactly). For f .x/ D x2, only the
        centered difference correctly gives f ½ D 2x: The one-sided ratio gave 2x C x

        (in Chapter 1 it was 2t C h). It is only "first-order accurate." But centering leaves no

        error. We are averaging 2x C x with 2x ¡ x: Thus the centered difference

        is "second-order accurate."

          I ask now: What ratio converges to the second derivative? One answer is to take

        differences of the first derivative. Certainly f ½=x approaches f ¾: But we want

        a ratio involving f itself. A natural idea is to take differences of differences, which
        brings us to "second differences":

     f .x C x/ ¡f .x/ ¡ f .x/ ¡f .x ¡x/  f .x C x/ ¡ 2f .x/ C f .x ¡ x/  d2f
     x  x                                                                dx2 : (3)
        x D .x/2

        On the top, the difference of the difference is .f / D 2f: It corresponds to d 2f:
        On the bottom, .x/2 corresponds to dx2 . This explains the way we place the 2's in
        d 2f =dx2: To say it differently: dx is squared, df is not squared--as in distance=.time/2:

          Note that .x/2 becomes much smaller than x: If we divide f by .x/2, the
        ratio blows up. It is the extra cancellation in the second difference 2f that allows

        the limit to exist. That limit is f ¾.x/:

        Application The great majority of equations can't be solved exactly. A typical case

        is f ¾.x/ D ¡ sinf .x/ (the pendulum equation). To compute a solution, I would

        replace f ¾.x/ by the second difference in equation (3). Approximations at points

        spaced by x are a very large part of scientific computing.

          To test the accuracy of these differences, here is an experiment on f .x/ D
        sin x C cos x: The table shows the errors at x D 0 from formulas .1/, .2/, .3/:

        step length x  one-sided errors  centered errors  second difference errors

              1=4            .1347            .0104            ¡:0052
              1=8            .0650            .0026            ¡:0013

        The one-sided errors are cut in half when x is cut in half. The other columns
        decrease like .x/2: Each reduction divides those errors by 4. The errors from

        one-sided differences are O.x/ and the errors from centered differences are
        O.x/2.

        The "big O" notation When the errors are of order x, we write E D O.x/:

        This means that E Cx for some constant C: We don't compute C --in fact we

        don't want to deal with it. The statement "one-sided errors are Oh of delta x" captures
        what is important. The main point of the other columns is E D O.x/2 .

                    LINEAR APPROXIMATION VS. QUADRATIC APPROXIMATION

        The second derivative gives a tremendous improvement over linear approximation

        f .a/Cf ½.a/.x ¡ a/: A tangent line starts out close to the curve, but the line has

        no way to bend. After a while it overshoots or undershoots the true function (see
        Figure 3.8). That is especially clear for the model f .x/ D x2, when the tangent is the
        x axis and the parabola curves upward.
                           3.3 Second Derivatives: Bending and Acceleration                                                                           157

             You can almost guess the term with bending. It should involve f ¾, and also .x/2:
          It might be exactly f ¾.x/ times .x/2 but it is not. The model function x2 has
             ¾                                        1
          f     D  2:  There   must  be   a  factor   2     to    cancel        that   2:

             3E The quadratic approximation to a smooth function f .x/ near x D a is

                                  f .x/      f  .a/  C   f     ½  .a/.x      ¡  a/  C       1  f  ¾  .a/.x       ¡  a/2:                   (4)
                                                                                            2

          At the basepoint this is f .a/ D f .a/: The derivatives also agree at x D a: Further-

          more the second derivatives agree. On both sides of .4/, the second derivative at

          x D a is f ¾.a/:

            The quadratic approximation bends with the function. It is not the absolutely

          final word, because there is a cubic term 61 f ¿.a/.x ¡ a/3 and a fourth-degree term
          241 f .a/.x ¡ a/4 and so on. The whole infinite sum is a "Taylor series." Equation (4)

          carries that series through the quadratic term--which for practical purposes gives a

          terrific approximation. You will see that in numerical experiments.

            Two things to mention. First, equation (4) shows why f ¾ 0 brings the curve

          above the tangent line. The linear part gives the line, while the quadratic part is

          positive and bends upward. Second, equation (4) comes from .2/ and .3/: Where

          one-sided differences give f .x C x/ f .x/ C f ½.x/x, centered differences

          give the quadratic:

                 from.2/ W f .x C x/ f .x ¡ x/ C 2f ½.x/x

                       from.3/ W f .x C x/ 2f .x/ ¡ f .x ¡ x/ C f ¾.x/.x/2:

          Add and divide by 2: The result is f .x C x/                                   f  .x/      C  f  ½.x/x        C      1  f  ¾.x/.x/2:
                                                                                                                               2
          This is correct through .x/2 and misses by .x/3, as examples show:

                                   3.4 Graphs

     Reading a graph is like appreciating a painting. Everything is there, but you have to
     know what to look for. One way to learn is by sketching graphs yourself, and in the
     past that was almost the only way. Now it is obsolete to spend weeks drawing curves--
     a computer or graphing calculator does it faster and better. That doesn't remove the
     need to appreciate a graph (or a painting), since a curve displays a tremendous amount
     of information.

       This section combines two approaches. One is to study actual machine-produced
     graphs (especially electrocardiograms). The other is to understand the mathematics of
     graphs--slope, concavity, asymptotes, shifts, and scaling. We introduce the centering
     transform and zoom transform. These two approaches are like the rest of calculus,
     where special derivatives and integrals are done by hand and day-to-day applications
     are by computer. Both are essential--the machine can do experiments that we could
     never do. But without the mathematics our instructions miss the point. To create good
     graphs you have to know a few of them personally.

                      READING AN ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG or EKG)

     The graphs of an ECG show the electrical potential during a heartbeat. There are
     twelve graphs--six from leads attached to the chest, and six from leads to the arms
     and left leg. (It doesn't hurt, but everybody is nervous. You have to lie still, because
     contraction of other muscles will mask the reading from the heart.) The graphs record
     electrical impulses, as the cells depolarize and the heart contracts.

        What can I explain in two pages? The graph shows the fundamental pattern of the
     ECG. Note the P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave. Those patterns, seen
     differently in the twelve graphs, tell whether the heart is normal or out of rhythm--or
     suffering an infarction (a heart attack).

        First of all the graphs show the heart rate. The dark vertical lines are by convention
     1                                          1                                                 1
     5  second  apart.  The  light  lines  are  25  second  apart.  If  the  heart  beats  every  5  second

     (one dark line) the rate is 5 beats per second or 300 per minute. That is extreme

     tachycardia--not compatible with life. The normal rate is between three dark lines
     per beat ( 53 second, or 100 beats per minute) and five dark lines (one second between
     beats, 60 per minute). A baby has a faster rate, over 100 per minute. In this figure the

     rate is    : A rate below 60 is bradycardia, not in itself dangerous. For a resting

     athlete that is normal.

        Doctors memorize the six rates 300; 150; 100; 75; 60; 50: Those correspond to 1; 2;

     3; 4; 5; 6 dark lines between heartbeats. The distance is easiest to measure between

     spikes (the peaks of the R wave). Many doctors put a printed scale next to the chart.

     One textbook emphasizes that "Where the next wave falls determines the rate. No

     mathematical computation is necessary." But you see where those numbers come

     from.
                                   3.4 Graphs                                                       161

The next thing to look for is heart rhythm. The regular rhythm is set by the

pacemaker, which produces the P wave. A constant distance between waves is good--

and then each beat is examined. When there is a block in the pathway, it shows as a

delay in the graph. Sometimes the pacemaker fires irregularly. Figure 3.10 shows

sinus arrythmia (fairly normal). The time between peaks is changing. In disease or

emergency, there are potential pacemakers in all parts of the heart.

I should have pointed out the main parts. We have four chambers, an atrium

ventricle pair on the left and right. The SA node should be the pacemaker. The

stimulus spreads from the atria to the ventricles-- from the small chambers that "prime

the pump" to the powerful chambers that drive blood through the body. The P wave
                                                                    1
comes  with  contraction  of  the  atria.  There  is  a  pause  of  10  second  at  the  AV  node.

Then the big QRS wave starts contraction of the ventricles, and the T wave is when

the ventricles relax. The cells switch back to negative charge and the heart cycle is

complete.

              Fig. 3.9 Happy person with a heart and a normal electrocardiogram.

  The ECG shows when the pacemaker goes wrong. Other pacemakers take over--
the AV node will pace at 60=minute: An early firing in the ventricle can give a wide
spike in the QRS complex, followed by a long pause. The impulses travel by a slow
path. Also the pacemaker can suddenly speed up (paroxysmal tachycardia is

150 ¡ 250=minute). But the most critical danger is fibrillation.

  Figure 3.10b shows a dying heart. The ECG indicates irregular contractions--no
normal PQRST sequence at all. What kind of heart would generate such a rhythm?
The muscles are quivering or "fibrillating" independently. The pumping action is
nearly gone, which means emergency care. The patient needs immediate CPR--
someone to do the pumping that the heart can't do. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation
is a combination of chest pressure and air pressure (hand and mouth) to restart the
rhythm. CPR can be done on the street. A hospital applies a defibrillator, which shocks
the heart back to life. It depolarizes all the heart cells, so the timing can be reset. Then
the charge spreads normally from SA node to atria to AV node to ventricles.

  This discussion has not used all twelve graphs to locate the problem. That needs
vectors. Look ahead at Section 11.1 for the heart vector, and especially at Section 11.2
for its twelve projections. Those readings distinguish between atrium and ventricle,
left and right, forward and back. This information is of vital importance in the event
of a heart attack. A "heart attack" is a myocardial infarction (MI).

  An MI occurs when part of an artery to the heart is blocked (a coronary occlusion).
162                   3 Applications of the Derivative

     Fig. 3.10 Doubtful rhythm. Serious fibrillation. Signals of a heart attack.

     An area is without blood supply--therefore without oxygen or glucose. Often the
     attack is in the thick left ventricle, which needs the most blood. The cells are first
     ischemic, then injured, and finally infarcted (dead). The classical ECG signals involve
     those three I's:

          Ischemia: Reduced blood supply, upside-down T wave in the chest leads.
          Injury: An elevated segment between S and T means a recent attack.
          Infarction: The Q wave, normally a tiny dip or absent, is as wide as a small
          square ( 251 second). It may occupy a third of the entire QRS complex.

     The Q wave gives the diagnosis. You can find all three I's in Figure 3.10c.
       It is absolutely amazing how much a good graph can do.

                      THE MECHANICS OF GRAPHS

     From the meaning of graphs we descend to the mechanics. A formula is now given for
     f .x/: The problem is to create the graph. It would be too old-fashioned to evaluate
     f .x/ by hand and draw a curve through a dozen points. A computer has a much better
     idea of a parabola than an artist (who tends to make it asymptotic to a straight line).
     There are some things a computer knows, and other things an artist knows, and still
     others that you and I know--because we understand derivatives.

       Our job is to apply calculus. We extract information from f ½ and f ¾ as well as f:

     Small movements in the graph may go unnoticed, but the important properties come
     through. Here are the main tests:

     1. The sign of f .x/ (above or below axis: f D 0 at crossing point)
     2. The sign of f ½.x/ (increasing or decreasing: f ½ D 0 at stationary point)
     3. The sign of f ¾.x/ (concave up or down: f ¾ D 0 at injection point)
                                        and x ¡
     4. The behavior of f .x/ as x      or f .x/ ¡

     5. The points at which f .x/
                      Periodic? Jumps in f or f ½? Endpoints? f .0/?
     6. Even or odd?

                                    x2  f ½.x/ D .1 ¡ x2/2 2x  f ¾.x/ D 2 C 6x2 2 3

     EXAMPLE 1 f .x/ D 1 ¡ x2                                         .1 ¡x /

     The sign of f .x/ depends on 1 ¡ x2: Thus f .x/ 0 in the inner interval where

     x2 1: The graph bends upwards (f ¾.x/ 0) in that same interval. There are no
     inflection points, since f ¾ is never zero. The stationary point where f ½ vanishes is

     x D 0: We have a local minimum at x D 0:

       The guidelines (or asymptotes) meet the graph at infinity. For large x the important

     terms are x2 and ¡x2: Their ratio is Cx2= ¡ x2 D ¡1--which is the limit as x
      , and x ¡ : The horizontal asymptote is the line y D ¡1.
      The other infinities, where f blows up, occur when 1 ¡ x2 is zero. That happens at

     x D 1 and x D ¡1: The vertical asymptotes are the lines x D 1 and x D ¡1. The
                                                  3.4 Graphs                                                                          163

if f .x/        C or b as x ¡ as x a, the line x D a is a vertical asymptote or ¡ , the line y D b is a horizontal asymptote
if f .x/
if f .x/ ¡ .mx C b/ 0 as x C or ¡ , the line y D mx C b is a sloping asymptote.
   Finally comes the vital fact that this function is even: f .x/ D f .¡x/ because

squaring x obliterates the sign. The graph is symmetric across the y axis.
   To summarize the effect of dividing by 1 ¡ x2: No effect near x D 0: Blowup at 1
and ¡1 from zero in the denominator. The function approaches ¡1 as x
                                                                                                                                   :

                              x2                  f ½ D x2 ¡ 2x2 f ¾ D 3 2
EXAMPLE 2 f .x/ D                                                                 .x ¡1/
                                    x¡1                    .x ¡1/
This example divides by x ¡ 1: Therefore x D 1 is a vertical asymptote, where f .x/

becomes infinite. Vertical asymptotes come mostly from zero denominators.

  Look beyond x D 1: Both f .x/ and f ¾.x/ are positive for x 1: The slope is

zero at x D 2: That must be a local minimum.
                                         ? Dividing x2 by x ¡ 1, the leading term is x: The
   What happens as x

function becomes large. It grows linearly--we expect a sloping asymptote. To find

it, do the division properly:

                                             x2                    1
                                            x ¡ 1 D x C 1 C x ¡ 1: (1)

The last term goes to zero. The function approaches y D x C 1 as the asymptote.

  This function is not odd or even. Its graph is in Figure 3.11b. With zoom out you

see the asymptotes. Zoom in for f D 0 or f ½ D 0 or f ¾ D 0:

          Fig. 3.11        The  graphs   of  x2=.1 ¡ x2/   and  x2=.x  ¡ 1/  and  sin  x  C  1  sin                           3x:
                                                                                             3

                                               3

Above all these functions are periodic. If x increases by 2, nothing changes. The

graphs from 2 to 4 are repetitions of the graphs from 0 to 2: Thus f .x C 2/ D

f .x/ and the period is 2: Any interval of length 2 will show a complete picture,

and Figure 3.11c picks the interval from ¡ to :

  The second outstanding property is that f is odd. The sine functions satisfy

f .¡x/ D ¡f .x/: The graph is symmetric through the origin. By reflecting the right

half through the origin, you get the left half. In contrast, the cosines in f ½.x/ are even.
  To find the zeros of f .x/ and f ½.x/ and f ¾.x/, rewrite those functions as

f  .x  /  D  2  sin  x  ¡  4  sin3  x    f ½.x/ D ¡2 cos x C 4 cos3x         f ¾.x/ D ¡10 sin x C 12 sin3x:

164                                3 Applications of the Derivative

     We changed sin 3x to 3 sin x ¡ 4 sin3x: For the derivatives use sin2x D 1 ¡ cos2x:

     Now find the zeros--the crossing points, stationary points, and inflection points:

      f D0      2 sin x D 43 sin3x           sin x D 0 or sin2x D 32         x D 0;¨
                2 cos x D 4 cos3x                                            x D ¨=4;¨=2;¨3=4
     f½D0                                    cos      xD0   or  cos2x D  1   x D 0;¨66¥;¨114¥;¨
     f¾D0       5 sin x D 6 sin3x                                        2

                                             sin x D 0 or sin2x D 56

     That is more than enough information to sketch the graph. The stationary points
     =4; =2; 3=4 are evenly spaced. At those points f .x/ is 8=3 (maximum), 2=3
     (local minimum), 8=3 (maximum). Figure 3.11c shows the graph.

        I would like to mention a beautiful continuation of this same pattern:

     f  .x/  D  sin  x  C  1  sin  3x  C  1  sin  5x  C¤¤¤      f ½.x/ D cos x C cos 3x C cos 5x C ¤ ¤ ¤
                           3              5

     If we stop after ten terms, f .x/ is extremely close to a step function. If we don't

     stop, the exact step function contains infinitely many sines. It jumps from ¡=4 to

     C=4 as x goes past zero. More precisely it is a "square wave," because the graph

     jumps back down at  and repeats. The slope cos x C cos 3x C ¤ ¤ ¤ also has period

     2: Infinitely many cosines add up to a delta function! (The slope at the jump is an

     infinite spike.) These sums of sines and cosines are Fourier series.

                           GRAPHS BY COMPUTERS AND CALCULATORS

     We have come to a topic of prime importance. If you have graphing software for
     a computer, or if you have a graphing calculator, you can bring calculus to life. A
     graph presents y.x/ in a new way--different from the formula. Information that is
     buried in the formula is clear on the graph. But don't throw away y.x/ and dy=dx.
     The derivative is far from obsolete.

       These pages discuss how calculus and graphs go together. We work on a crucial
     problem of applied mathematics--to find where y.x/ reaches its minimum. There is
     no need to tell you a hundred applications. Begin with the formula. How do you find

     the point x¦ where y.x/ is smallest ?

       First, draw the graph. That shows the main features. We should see (roughly) where

     x¦ lies. There may be several minima, or possibly none. But what we see depends on

     a decision that is ours to make--the range of x and y in the viewing window.
       If nothing is known about y.x/, the range is hard to choose. We can accept a default

     range, and zoom in or out. We can use the autoscaling program in Section 1.7.

     Somehow x¦ can be observed on the screen. Then the problem is to compute it.

       I would like to work with a specific example. We solved it by calculus--to find

     the best point x¦ to enter an expressway. The speeds in Section 3.2 were 30 and 60:

     The length of the fast road will be b D 6: The range of reasonable values for the
     entering point is 0 x 6: The distance to the road in Figure 3.12 is a D 3: We

     drive a distance 32 C x2 at speed 30 and the remaining distance 6 ¡ x at speed 60:

                           driving time y.x/ D 1 32 C x2 C 1 .6 ¡ x/:           (2)
                                                      30                 60

     This is the function to be minimized. Its graph is extremely flat.

       It may seem unusual for the graph to be so level. On the contrary, it is common.
     A flat graph is the whole point of dy=dx D 0:
                                          3.4 Graphs                                   165

  The graph near the minimum looks like y D C x2: It is a parabola sitting on a
horizontal tangent. At a distance of x D :01, we only go up by C.x/2 D :0001C:
Unless C is a large number, this y can hardly be seen.

      Fig. 3.12 Enter at x: The graph of driving time y.x/: Zoom boxes locate x¦.

  The solution is to change scale. Zoom in on x¦: The tangent line stays flat, since

dy=dx is still zero. But the bending from C is increased. Figure 3.12 shows the zoom
box blown up into a new graph of y.x/:

  A calculator has one or more ways to find x¦: With a TRACE mode, you direct
  a cursor along the graph. From the display of y values, read ymax and x¦ to the

  nearest pixel. A zoom gives better accuracy, because it stretches the axes--each
  pixel represents a smaller x and y: The TI-81 stretches by 4 as default. Even
  better, let the whole process be graphical--draw the actual ZOOM BOX on the
  screen. Pick two opposite corners, press ENTER, and the box becomes the new
  viewing window (Figure 3.12).

  The first zoom narrows the search for x¦: It lies between x D 1 and x D 3: We build
a new ZOOM BOX and zoom in again. Now 1:5 x¦ 2: Reasonable accuracy

comes quickly. High accuracy does not come quickly. It takes time to create the box
and execute the zoom.

Question 1 What happens as we zoom in, if all boxes are square (equal scaling) ?

Answer The picture gets flatter and flatter. We are zooming in to the tangent line.
Changing x to X=4 and y to Y =4, the parabola y D x2 flattens to Y D X 2=4: To see
any bending, we must use a long thin zoom box.

  I want to change to a totally different approach. Suppose we have a formula for
dy=dx: That derivative was produced by an infinite zoom! The limit of y=x
came by brainpower alone:

dy D x D ¡ 1 :    Call this f .x/:

dx 30 32 C x2 60

This function is zero at x¦: The computing problem is completely changed: Solve

f .x/ D 0: It is easier to find a root of f .x/ than a minimum of y.x/. The graph of
f .x/ crosses the x axis. The graph of y.x/ goes flat--this is harder to pinpoint.
166                                      3 Applications of the Derivative

   Fig. 3.13    Take the model function y D x2 for x :01: The slope f D 2x changes

              from ¡:02 to C:02: The value of x2 moves only by :0001 --its minimum point is

              hard to see.
                To repeat: Minimization is easier with dy=dx: The screen shows an order of

              magnitude improvement, when we trace or zoom on f .x/ D 0: In calculus, we have
              been taking the derivative for granted. It is natural to get blasé about dy=dx D 0: We
              forget how intelligent it is, to work with the slope instead of the function.

              Question 2 How do you get another order of magnitude improvement ?
              Answer Use the next derivative! With a formula for df =dx, which is d 2y=dx2,
              the convergence is even faster. In two steps the error goes from :01 to :0001 to
              :00000001: Another infinite zoom went into the formula for df =dx, and Newton's
              method takes account of it. Sections 3.6 and 3.7 study f .x/ D 0:

                The expressway example allows perfect accuracy. We can solve dy=dx D 0 by
              algebra. The equation simplifies to 60x D 30 32 C x2: Dividing by 30 and squaring

              yields 4x2 D 32 C x2: Then 3x2 D 32: The exact solution is x¦ D 3 D 1:73205 : : :

                A model like this is a benchmark, to test competing methods. It also displays what
              we never appreciated--the extreme flatness of the graph. The difference in driving

              time between entering at x¦ D 3 and x D 2 is one second.

                            THE CENTERING TRANSFORM AND ZOOM TRANSFORM

              For a photograph we do two things--point the right way and stand at the right
              distance. Then take the picture. Those steps are the same for a graph. First we pick
              the new center point. The graph is shifted, to move that point from .a; b/ to .0; 0/:
              Then we decide how far the graph should reach. It fits in a rectangle, just like the
              photograph. Rescaling to x=c and y=d puts the desired section of the curve into the
              rectangle.

                A good photographer does more (like an artist). The subjects are placed and
              the camera is focused. For good graphs those are necessary too. But an everyday
              calculator or computer or camera is built to operate without an artist--just aim
              and shoot. I want to explain how to aim at y D f .x/:

                We are doing exactly what a calculator does, with one big difference. It doesn't

              change coordinates. We do. When x D 1, y D ¡2 moves to the center of the viewing
              window, the calculator still shows that point as .1; ¡2/: When the centering
              transform acts on y C 2 D m.x ¡ 1/, those numbers disappear. This will be
              confusing unless x and y also change. The new coordinates are X D x ¡ 1 and

              Y D y C 2. Then the new equation is Y D mX .
                The main point (for humans) is to make the algebra simpler. The computer has no

              preference for Y D mX over y ¡ y0 D m.x ¡ x0/: It accepts 2x2 ¡ 4x as easily as

              x2: But we do prefer Y D mX and y D x2, partly because their graphs go through
              .0; 0/: Ever since zero was invented, mathematicians have liked that number best.

                3F A centering transform shifts left by a and down by b:

                  X D x ¡ a and Y D y ¡ b change y D f .x/ into Y C b D f .X C a/:

              EXAMPLE 4 The parabola y D 2x2 ¡ 4x has its minimum when dy=dx D
              4x ¡ 4 D 0: Thus x D 1 and y D ¡2: Move this bottom point to the center:

y D 2x2 ¡ 4x is
          Y C 2 D 2.X ¡ 1/2 ¡ 4.X ¡ 1/ or Y D 2X2:

The new parabola Y D 2X 2 has its bottom at .0; 0/: It is the same curve, shifted
across and up. The only simpler parabola is y D x2: This final step is the job of the
zoom.

  Next comes scaling. We may want more detail (zoom in to see the tangent line).
We may want a big picture (zoom out to check asymptotes). We might stretch one
axis more than the other, if the picture looks like a pancake or a skyscraper.

  3G A zoom transform scales the X and Y axes by c and d :

        x D cX and y D d Y change Y D F .X / to y D dF .x=c/:
  The new x and y are boldface letters, and the graph is rescaled. Often c D d:

EXAMPLE 5 Start with Y D 2X 2: Apply a square zoom with c D d: In the
new xy coordinates, the equation is y=c D 2.x=c/2: The number 2 disappears if
c D d D 2: With the right centering and the right zoom, every parabola that opens
upward is y D x2:

Question 3 What happens to the derivatives (slope and bending) after a zoom ?
Answer The slope (first derivative) is multiplied by d=c: Apply the chain rule to
y D dF .x=c/: A square zoom has d=c D 1--lines keep their slope. The second
derivative is multiplied by d=c2, which changes the bending. A zoom out divides
by small numbers c D d , so the big picture is more, curved.

  Combining the centering and zoom transforms, as we do in practice, gives y in
terms of x:

  y D f .x/ becomes Y D f .X C a/ ¡ b and then y D d f x   C a ¡ b :

                                                                                c

Fig. 3.14 Change of coordinates by centering and zoom. Calculators still show .x; y/:

Question 4 Find x and y ranges after two transforms. Start between ¡1 and 1:
Answer The window after centering is ¡1 x ¡ a 1 and ¡1 y ¡ b 1: The
window after zoom is ¡1 c.x ¡ a/ 1 and ¡1 d.y ¡ b/ 1: The point .1; 1/

was originally in the corner. The point .c¡1 C a; d ¡1 C b/ is now in the corner.

The numbers a; b; c; d are chosen to produce a simpler function (like y D x2).

Or else--this is important in applied mathematics--they are chosen to make x and y
"dimensionless." An example is y D 12 cos 8t: The frequency 8 has dimension
                         1
1=time.  The  amplitude  2  is  a  distance.  With  d  D2  cm  and  cD8  sec,  the  units  are

removed and y D cos t:

                          May I mention one transform that does change the slope ? It is a rotation.
                        The whole plane is turned. A photographer might use it--but normally people are
                        supposed to be upright. You use rotation when you turn a map or straighten a picture.

               3.5 Parabolas, Ellipses, and Hyperbolas

     Here is a list of the most important curves in mathematics, so you can tell what is
     coming. It is not easy to rank the top four:

        1. straight lines
        2. sines and cosines (oscillation)
        3. exponentials (growth and decay)
        4. parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas (using 1; x; y; x2; xy; y2).

     The curves that I wrote last, the Greeks would have written first. It is so natural to
     go from linear equations to quadratic equations. Straight lines use 1; x; y: Second
     degree curves include x2; xy; y2: If we go on to x3 and y3, the mathematics gets
     complicated. We now study equations of second degree, and the curves they produce.

       It is quite important to see both the equations and the curves. This section connects
     two great parts of mathematics--analysis of the equation and geometry of the curve.
     Together they produce "analytic geometry." You already know about functions and
     graphs. Even more basic: Numbers correspond to points. We speak about "the point
     .5; 2/:" Euclid might not have understood.

       Where Euclid drew a 45¥ line through the origin, Descartes wrote down y D x:

     Analytic geometry has become central to mathematics--we now look at one part of it.

           Fig. 3.15 The cutting plane gets steeper: circle to ellipse to parabola to hyperbola.

                                               CONIC SECTIONS

     The parabola and ellipse and hyperbola have absolutely remarkable properties. The
     Greeks discovered that all these curves come from slicing a cone by a plane. The
     curves are "conic sections." A level cut gives a circle, and a moderate angle produces
     an ellipse. A steep cut gives the two pieces of a hyperbola (Figure 3.15d). At the
     borderline, when the slicing angle matches the cone angle, the plane carves out a
     parabola. It has one branch like an ellipse, but it opens to infinity like a hyperbola.

       Throughout mathematics, parabolas are on the border between ellipses and
     hyperbolas.

       To repeat: We can slice through cones or we can look for equations. For a cone
     of light, we see an ellipse on the wall. (The wall cuts into the light cone.) For an
     equation Ax2 C Bxy C Cy2 C Dx C Ey C F D 0, we will work to make it simpler.
                        3.5 Parabolas, Ellipses, and Hyperbolas                                                   171

The graph will be centered and rescaled (and rotated if necessary), aiming for an
equation like y D x2: Eccentricity and polar coordinates are left for Chapter 9.

                               THE PARABOLA y D ax2 C bx C c

You knew this function long before calculus. The graph crosses the x axis when
y D 0: The quadratic formula solves y D 3x2 ¡ 4x C 1 D 0, and so does factoring
          ¡ 1/.3x    ¡ 1/:                                  D             D   1
into  .x                      The    crossing    points  x     1  and  x      3    come  from  algebra.

The other important point is found by calculus. It is the minimum point, where
                  ¡                                      4     2
dy=dx     D  6x      4  D  0:  The   x  coordinate   is  6  D  3  ,  halfway  between    the   crossing  points.
                           ¡
The   height  is  ymin  D      1  :  This  is  the  vertex  V  in Figure 3.16a--at the bottom of the
                               3

parabola.

 A parabola has no asymptotes. The slope 6x ¡ 4 doesn't approach a constant.

To    center    the     vertex    Shift    left  by  2      and   up   by    31 :  So    introduce  the  new
                        ¡                            3                                   ¡
                           2         Y D y C 31 :                x D 23                     1
variables    X  D  x       3   and                   Then                 and      y  D     3  correspond  to

X D Y D 0--which is the new vertex:

                           y D 3x2 ¡ 4x C 1 becomes Y D 3X 2:                                              (1)

Check the algebra. Y D 3X 2 is the same as y C 31 D 3 x ¡ 32 2 : That simplifies to
the original equation y D 3x2 ¡ 4x C 1: The second graph shows the centered parabola

Y D 3X 2, with the vertex moved to the origin.

To zoom in on the vertex Rescale X and Y by the zoom factor a:

                              Y D 3X 2 becomes y=a D 3.x=a/2:

The final equation has x and y in boldface. With a D 3 we find y D x2--the graph is
magnified by 3: In two steps we have reached the model parabola opening upward.

Fig. 3.16 Parabola with minimum at V: Rays reflect to focus. Centered in (b), rescaled in (c).

  A parabola has another important point--the focus. Its distance from the vertex is
called p: The special parabola y D x2 has p D 1=4, and other parabolas Y D aX 2
have p D 1=4a: You magnify by a factor a to get y D x2: The beautiful property of a
parabola is that every ray coming straight down is reflected to the focus.

  Problem 2:3:25 located the focus F --here we mention two applications. A solar
collector and a TV dish are parabolic. They concentrate sun rays and TV signals
onto a point--a heat cell or a receiver collects them at the focus. The 1982 UMAP
Journal explains how radar and sonar use the same idea. Car headlights turn the idea
around, and send the light outward.

  Here is a classical fact about parabolas. From each point on the curve, the
distance to the focus equals the distance to the "directrix." The directrix is the
172                         3 Applications of the Derivative

     line y D ¡p below the vertex (so the vertex is halfway between focus and directrix).
                 1                                                        1
     With  p  D  4  ,  the  distance  down  from  any  .x;  y/  is  y  C  4  :  Match  that  with  the  distance

     to the focus at 0; 41 -- this is the square root below. Out comes the special parabola
     y D x2:

      y C 14 D x2 C y ¡ 1 2 4 ¡¡¡ (square both sides) ¡¡¡ y D x2: (2)

     The exercises give practice with all the steps we have taken--center the parabola to
     Y D aX 2, rescale it to y D x2, locate the vertex and focus and directrix.

     Summary for other parabolas y D ax2 C bx C c has its vertex where dy=dx is

     zero. Thus 2ax C b D 0 and x D ¡b=2a: Shifting across to that point is "completing

     the square":
                           ax2  C bx C c equals a x C b 2 C C: (3)
                                                                  2a

     Here C D c ¡ .b2=4a/ is the height of the vertex. The centering transform
     X D x C .b=2a/, Y D y ¡ C produces Y D aX 2: It moves the vertex to .0; 0/, where

     it belongs.
       For the ellipse and hyperbola, our plan of attack is the same:

              1. Center the curve to remove any linear terms Dx and Ey:
              2. Locate each focus and discover the reflection property.
              3. Rotate to remove Bxy if the equation contains it.

                                      x2 y2
                        ELLIPSES a2 C b2 D 1 (CIRCLES HAVE a D b)

     This equation makes the ellipse symmetric about .0; 0/--the center. Changing x to

     ¡x or y to ¡y leaves the same equation. No extra centering or rotation is needed.

       The equation also shows that x2=a2 and y2=b2 cannot exceed one. (They add

     to one and can't be negative.) Therefore x2 a2, and x stays between ¡a and a:
     Similarly y stays between b and ¡b: The ellipse is inside a rectangle.

       By solving for y we get a function (or two functions!) of x:

          b2 y D 1 2 ¡ a2 x gives b D 2 y ¨ 1 ¡ a2 x or y D 2 ¨ ba a2 ¡ x2:

     The graphs are the top half .C/ and bottom half .¡/ of the ellipse. To draw the ellipse,

     plot them together. They meet when y D 0, at x D a on the far right of Figure 3.17

     and at x D ¡a on the far left. The maximum y D b and minimum y D ¡b are at the

     top and bottom of the ellipse, where we bump into the enclosing rectangle.
       A circle is a special case of an ellipse, when a D b. The circle equation x2 C

     y2 D r2 is the ellipse equation with a D b D r: This circle is centered at .0; 0/; other

     circles are centered at x D h; y D k: The circle is determined by its radius r and its

     center .h; k/:

                            Equation of circle W .x ¡ h/2 C .y ¡ k/2 D r2:                              (4)

       In words, the distance from .x; y/ on the circle to .h; k/ at the center is r: The

     equation has linear terms ¡2hx and ¡2ky--they disappear when the center is .0; 0/:

EXAMPLE 1 Find the circle that has a diameter from .1; 7/ to .5; 7/:

Solution The center is halfway at .3; 7/: So r D 2 and .x ¡ 3/2 C .y ¡ 7/2 D 22:
EXAMPLE 2 Find the center and radius of the circle x2 ¡ 6x C y2 ¡ 14y D ¡54:
Solution Complete x2 ¡ 6x to the square .x ¡ 3/2 by adding 9: Complete
y2 ¡ 14y to .y ¡ 7/2 by adding 49: Adding 9 and 49 to both sides of the equation
leaves .x ¡ 3/2 C .y ¡ 7/2 D 4--the same circle as in Example 1.

Quicker Solution Match the given equation with .4/: Then h D 3, k D 7, and r D 2:

x2 ¡ 6x C y2 ¡ 14y D ¡54 must agree with x2 ¡ 2hx C h2 C y2 ¡ 2ky C k2 D r2:

 The change to X D x ¡ h and Y D y ¡ k moves the center of the circle from .h; k/

to .0; 0/: This is equally true for an ellipse:

        .x ¡ h/2 .y ¡ k/2a b  becomes  X2 Y 2
                                       a2 C b2 D 1
The ellipse 2 C 2 D 1

When we rescale by x D X=a and y D Y =b, we get the unit circle x2 C y2 D 1:
  The unit circle has area : The ellipse has area ab (proved later in the book).

The distance around the circle is 2: The distance around an ellipse does not rescale--

it has no simple formula.

Fig. 3.17 Uncentered circle. Centered ellipse x2=32 C y2=22 D 1: The distance from center
              to far right is also a D 3: All rays from F2 reflect to F1:

  Now we leave circles and concentrate on ellipses. They have two foci (pronounced
fo-sigh). For a parabola, the second focus is at infinity. For a circle, both foci are at
the center. The foci of an ellipse are on its longer axis (its major axis), one focus on
each side of the center:

           F1 is at x D c D a2 ¡ b2 and F2 is at x D ¡c:

The right triangle in Figure 3.17 has sides a; b; c: From the top of the ellipse, the
distance to each focus is a: From the endpoint at x D a, the distances to the foci are

a C c and a ¡ c: Adding .a C c/ C .a ¡ c/ gives 2a: As you go around the ellipse,

the distance to F1 plus the distance to F2 is constant (always 2a).

  3H At all points on the ellipse, the sum of distances from the foci is 2a: This
  is another equation for the ellipse:

   from F1 and F2 to .x; y/ W .x ¡ c/2 C y2 C .x C c/2 C y2 D 2a: (5)
174                             3 Applications of the Derivative

     To draw an ellipse, tie a string of length 2a to the foci. Keep the string taut and your
     moving pencil will create the ellipse. This description uses a and c--the other form
     uses a and b (remember b2 C c2 D a2). Problem 24 asks you to simplify equation (5)
     until you reach x2=a2 C y2=b2 D 1:

       The "whispering gallery" of the United States Senate is an ellipse. If you stand at
     one focus and speak quietly, you can be heard at the other focus (and nowhere else).
     Your voice is reflected off the walls to the other focus--following the path of the
     string. For a parabola the rays come in to the focus from infinity--where the second
     focus is.

       A hospital uses this reflection property to split up kidney stones. The patient sits
     inside an ellipse with the kidney stone at one focus. At the other focus a lithotripter
     sends out hundreds of small shocks. You get a spinal anesthetic (I mean the patient)
     and the stones break into tiny pieces.

       The most important focus is the Sun. The ellipse is the orbit of the Earth. See
     Section 12.4 for a terrible printing mistake by the Royal Mint, on England's
     last pound note. They put the Sun at the center.

     Question 1 Why do the whispers (and shock waves) arrive together at the second
     focus ?
     Answer Whichever way they go, the distance is 2a: Exception: straight path is 2c:

     Question 2 Locate the ellipse with equation 4x2 C 9y2 D 36:
     Answer Divide by 36 to change the constant to 1: Now identify a and b:

           x C D 1 so a D 9 and b D 4: Foci at 2 y2 ¨ 9 ¡ 4 D ¨ 5:

               94

     Question 3 Shift the center of that ellipse across and down to x D 1, y D ¡5:
     Answer Change x to x ¡ 1: Change y to y C 5: The equation becomes
     .x ¡ 1/2=9 C .y C 5/2=4 D 1: In practice we start with this uncentered ellipse and

     go the other way to center it.

                          HYPERBOLAS y2 ¡ x D 1 2

                                                          a2 b2

     Notice the minus sign for a hyperbola. That makes all the difference. Unlike an
     ellipse, x and y can both be large. The curve goes out to infinity. It is still symmetric,

     since x can change to ¡x and y to ¡y:
      The center is at .0; 0/: Solving for y again yields two functions (C and ¡):

          a2 y2 ¡ b2 x D 1 gives a D 2 y ¨ 1 C b2 x or y D 2 ¨ ab b2 C x2: (6)

     The hyperbola has two branches that never meet. The upper branch, with a plus sign,
     has y a: The vertex V1 is at x D 0; y D a--the lowest point on the branch. Much
     further out, when x is large, the hyperbola climbs up beside its sloping asymptotes:

             if b2 x D 1000 then a2 D 1001: So a is close to b or 2 y2 y x ¡ xb :

Fig. 3.18        The hyperbola 14 y2 ¡ 19 x2 D 1 has a D 2; b D 3; c D    4 C 9: The distances to F1

                 and F2 differ by 2a D 4:

The asymptotes are the lines y=a D x=b and y=a D ¡x=b: Their slopes are a=b and
¡a=b: You can't miss them in Figure 3.18.

  For a hyperbola, the foci are inside the two branches. Their distance from the
center is still called c: But now c D a2 C b2, which is larger than a and b: The

vertex is a distance c ¡ a from one focus and c C a from the other. The difference
(not the sum) is .c C a/ ¡ .c ¡ a/ D 2a:

  All points on the hyperbola have this property: The difference between distances
to the foci is constantly 2a: A ray coming in to one focus is reflected toward the
other. The reflection is on the outside of the hyperbola, and the inside of the ellipse.

  Here is an application to navigation. Radio signals leave two fixed transmitters at

the same time. A ship receives the signals a millisecond apart. Where is the ship ?
Answer: It is on a hyperbola with foci at the transmitters. Radio signals travel
186 miles in a millisecond, so 186 D 2a: This determines the curve. In Long Range

Navigation (LORAN) a third transmitter gives another hyperbola. Then the ship is

located exactly.

Question 4 How do hyperbolas differ from parabolas, far from the center ?
Answer Hyperbolas have asymptotes. Parabolas don't.

  The hyperbola has a natural rescaling. The appearance of x=b is a signal to change
to X: Similarly y=a becomes Y: Then Y D 1 at the vertex, and we have a standard
hyperbola:

           y2=a2 ¡ x2=b2 D 1 becomes Y 2 ¡ X 2 D 1:

A 90¥ turn gives X 2 ¡ Y 2 D 1--the hyperbola opens to the sides. A 45¥ turn

ellipse and x2 C 3xy C y2 D 1 as a hyperbola. (They are not circles because of the
xy term.) When the xy coefficient increases past 2, x2 C y2 no longer indicates an

ellipse.

             THE GENERAL EQUATION Ax2 C Bxy C Cy2 C Dx C Ey C F D 0
     This equation is of second degree, containing any and all of 1; x; y; x2; xy; y2:
     A plane is cutting through a cone. Is the curve a parabola or ellipse or
     hyperbola ? Start with the most important case Ax2 C Bxy C Cy2 D 1:

     3I The equation Ax2 C Bxy C cy2 D 1 produces a hyperbola if B2 4AC and
     an ellipse if B2 4AC: A parabola has B2 D 4AC:

     To recognize the curve, we remove Bxy by rotating the plane. This also changes A

     and C --but the combination B2 ¡ 4AC is not changed (proof omitted). An
     example is 2xy D 1, with B2 D 4: It rotates to y2 ¡ x2 D 1, with ¡4AC D 4: That
     positive number 4 signals a hyperbola--since A D ¡1 and C D 1 have opposite signs.

       Another example is x2 C y2 D 1: It is a circle (a special ellipse). However we

     rotate, the equation stays the same. The combination B2 ¡ 4AC D 0 ¡ 4 ¤ 1 ¤ 1 is

     negative, as predicted for ellipses.

       To rotate by an angle , change x and y to new variables x½ and y½:

     x Dx½ cos ¡ y½ sin   x½ D x cos C y sin 
     y D x½ sin  C y½ cos  and y½ D ¡ y sin  C x cos :          (7)

     Substituting for x and y changes Ax2 C Bxy C Cy2 D 1 to A½x½2 C B½x½y½ C C ½y½2 D
     1: The formulas for A½, B½, C ½ are painful so I go to the key point:

     B½ is zero if the rotation angle  has tan 2 D B=.A ¡ C /:

     With B½ D 0, the curve is easily recognized from A½x½2 C C ½y½2 D 1: It is a hyperbola

     if A½ and C ½ have opposite signs. Then B½2 ¡ 4A½C ½ is positive. The original B2 ¡ 4AC

     was also positive, because this special combination stays constant during rotation.

       After the xy term is gone, we deal with x and y--by centering. To find the center,
     complete squares as in Questions 3 and 6: For total perfection, rescale to one of the

     model equations y D x2 or x2 C y2 D 1 or y2 ¡ x2 D 1:

       The remaining question is about F D 0: What is the graph of Ax2 C Bxy C Cy2 D 0 ?

     The ellipse-hyperbola-parabola have disappeared. But if the Greeks were right, the
     cone is still cut by a plane. The degenerate case F D 0 occurs when the plane cuts
     right through the sharp point of the cone.

       A level cut hits only that one point .0; 0/: The equation shrinks to x2 C y2 D 0,

     a circle with radius zero. A steep cut gives two lines. The hyperbola becomes y2 ¡
     x2 D 0, leaving only its asymptotes y D ¨x: A cut at the exact angle of the cone

     gives only one line, as in x2 D 0: A single point, two lines, and one line are very

     extreme cases of an ellipse, hyperbola, and parabola.

       All these "conic sections" come from planes and cones. The beauty of the geometry,
     which Archimedes saw, is matched by the importance of the equations. Galileo
     discovered that projectiles go along parabolas (Chapter 12). Kepler discovered that
     the Earth travels on an ellipse (also Chapter 12). Finally Einstein discovered that
     light travels on hyperbolas. That is in four dimensions, and not in Chapter 12.

                                 3.6 Iterations xnC1 D F.xn/

Iteration means repeating the same function. Suppose the function is F .x/ D
cos x: Choose any starting value, say x0 D 1: Take its cosine: x1 D cos x0 D :54:
Then take the cosine of x1. That produces x2 D cos :54 D :86: The iteration is
xnC1 D cos xn. I am in radian mode on a calculator, pressing "cos" each time. The
early numbers are not important, what is important is the output after 12 or 30 or 100

steps:

EXAMPLE 1 x12 D :75; x13 D :73; x14 D :74; : : : ; x29 D :7391; x30 D :7391:

The goal is to explain why the x's approach x¦ D :739085 : : :: Every starting value
x0 leads to this same number x¦: What is special about :7391 ?

Note on iterations Do x1 D cos x0, and x2 D cos x1, mean that x2 D cos2x0 ?

Absolutely not! Iteration creates a new and different function cos.cos x/: It uses the

cos button, not the squaring button. The third step creates F .F .F .x///: As soon as
                                                  1                                                                                      21 .:7931/
you  can,    iterate   with   xnC1       D        2  cos       xn:      What      limit       do  the  x's  approach ?          Is  it               ?

  Let me slow down to understand these questions. The central idea is expressed
by the equation xnC1 D F .xn/. Substituting x0 into F gives x1: This output x1 is
the input that leads to x2: In its turn, x2 is the input and out comes x3 D F .x2/: This
is iteration, and it produces the sequence x0; x1; x2; : : : :

  The x's may approach a limit x¦, depending on the function F: Sometimes x¦

also depends on the starting value x0: Sometimes there is no limit. Look at a second
example, which does not need a calculator.

EXAMPLE 2                xnC1    D      F  .xn/         D      1  xn    C   4:    Starting        from    x0  D     0  the   sequence       is
                                                               2

Those  numbers           0;  4;  6;  7;  7  1  ;  :  :  :  seem         to  be    approaching          x¦     D  8:    A  computer        would
                                            2
convince us. So will mathematics, when we see what is special about 8:

                   When          the    x's   approach            x¦,          the   limit    of  xnC1    D      1  xn  C    4
                                                                                                                 2
                          x¦            x¦                                                                     x¦
                      is      D      1       C       4:    This   limiting              equation       yields          D  8:
                                     2

8 is the "steady state" where input equals output: 8 D F .8/: It is the fixed point.
  If we start at x0 D 8, the sequence is 8; 8; 8; : : :: When we start at x0 D 12, the

sequence goes back toward 8:

          x1    D  1  ¤  12  C   4   D   10;            x2     D  1     ¤   10    C  4  D     9;    x3    D   1  ¤  9  C  4  D     8:5;     ::::
                   2                                              2                                           2

Equation for limit: If the iterations xnC1 D F .xn/ converge to x¦, then x¦ D F .x¦/.

To  repeat:     8  is    special      because              it  equals          1  ¤  8  C  4  :  The   number          :7391 : : :    is  special
                                                                               2
because it equals cos :7391 : : :: The graphs of y D x and y D F .x/ intersect at
x¦. To explain why the x's converge (or why they don't) is the job of calculus.

EXAMPLE 3                xnC1    D      x2        has two fixed points: 0 D 02                                      and 1 D 12: Here

approaches to x¦ D 1 are from x0 D 1 (of course) and from x0 D ¡1: Starting from2

180                             3 Applications of the Derivative

       Each limit x¦ has a "basin of attraction." The basin contains all starting points x0
     that lead to x¦: For Examples 1 and 2, every x0 led to :7391 and 8: The basins were

     the whole line (that is still to be proved). Example 3 had three basins--the interval

     ¡1 x0 1, the two points x0 D ¨1, and all the rest. The outer basin x0 1 led
     to ¨ : I challenge you to find the limits and the basins of attraction (by calculator)
     for F .x/ D x ¡ tan x:

       In Example 3, x¦ D 0 is attracting. Points near x¦ move toward x¦: The fixed
     point x¦ D 1 is repelling. Points near 1 move away. We now find the rule that decides
     whether x¦ is attracting or repelling. The key is the slope dF=dx at x¦.

      3J Start from any x0 near a fixed point x¦ D F .x¦/:
                        x¦ is attracting if dF=dx is below 1 at x¦
                        x¦ is repelling if dF=dx is above 1 at x¦:

     First I will give a calculus proof. Then comes a picture of convergence, by "cobwebs."
     Both methods throw light on this crucial test for attraction: dF=dx 1:

      First proof: Subtract x¦ D F .x¦/ from xnC1 D F .xn/: The difference xnC1 ¡ x¦
     is the same as F .xn/ ¡ F .x¦/: This is F: The basic idea of calculus is that F

     is close to F ½x:

     xnC1 ¡ x¦ D F .xn/ ¡ F .x¦/ F ½.x¦/.xn ¡ x¦/:  (1)

     The "error" xn ¡ x¦ is multiplied by the slope dF=dx: The next error xnC1 ¡ x¦ is

     smaller or larger, based on F ½ 1 or F ½ 1 at x¦: Every step multiplies
     approximately by F ½.x¦/: Its size controls the speed of convergence.

      In Example 1, F .x/ is cos x and F ½.x/ is ¡ sin x: There is attraction to :7391

     because sin x¦ 1: In Example 2, F is 12 x C 4 and F ½ is 21 : There is attraction to
     8: In Example 3, F is x2 and F ½ is 2x: There is superattraction to x¦ D 0 (where
     F ½ D 0). There is repulsion from x¦ D 1 (where F ½ D 2).

       I admit one major difficulty. The approximation in equation (1) only holds near

     x¦: If x0 is far away, does the sequence still approach x¦ ? When there are several
     attracting points, which x¦ do we reach ? This section starts with good iterations,
     which solve the equation x¦ D F .x¦/ or f .x/ D 0: At the end we discover Newton's

     method. The next section produces crazy but wonderful iterations, not converging and
     not blowing up. They lead to "fractals" and "Cantor sets" and "chaos."

       The mathematics of iterations is not finished. It may never be finished, but we are
     converging on the answers. Please choose a function and join in.

                             THE GRAPH OF AN ITERATION: COBWEBS

     The iteration xnC1 D F .xn/ involves two graphs at the same time. One is the graph

     of y D F .x/: The other is the graph of y D x (the 45¥ line). The iteration jumps back

     and forth between these graphs. It is a very convenient way to see the whole process.
       Example 1 was xnC1 D cos xn: Figure 3.19 shows the graph of cos x and the

     "cobweb." Starting at .x0; x0/ on the 45¥ line, the rule is based on x1 D F .x0/:

                     From .x0; x0/ go up or down to .x0; x1/ on the curve.

                   From .x0; x1/ go across to .x1; x1/ on the 45¥ line.
                           3.6 Iterations xnC1 D F.xn/                                                     181

These steps are repeated forever. From x1 go up to the curve at F .x1/: That height

is x2: Now cross to the 45¥ line at .x2; x2/: The iterations are aiming for .x¦; x¦/ D

.:7391; :7391/: This is the crossing point of the two graphs y D F .x/ and y D x:

Fig. 3.19 Cobwebs go from .x0; x0/ to .x0; x1/ to .x1; x1/--line to curve to line.

Example       2  was  xnC1  D    1   x  n  C   4  :  Both  graphs  are  straight  lines.  The  cobweb  is
                                 2
one-sided, from .0; 0/ to .0; 4/ to .4; 4/ to .4; 6/ to .6; 6/: Notice how y changes
(vertical line) and then x changes (horizontal line). The slope of F .x/ is 21 , so the
                                     1
distance  to  8  is  multiplied  by  2     at  every  step.
Example 3 was xnC1 D xn2: The graph of y D x2 crosses the 45¥ line at two fixed
points: 02 D 0 and 12 D 1: Figure 3.20a starts the iteration close to 1, but it quickly
goes away. This fixed point is repelling because F ½.1/ D 2: Distance from x¦ D 1
is doubled (at the start). One path moves down to x¦ D 0--which is superattractive
because F ½ D 0: The path from x0 1 diverges to infinity.

EXAMPLE 4 F .x/ has two attracting points x¦ (a repelling x¦ is always between).

Figure 3.20b shows two crossings with slope zero. The iterations and cobwebs

converge quickly. In between, the graph of F .x/ must cross the 45¥ line from below.

That requires a slope greater than one. Cobwebs diverge from this unstable point,
which separates the basins of attraction. The fixed point x D  is in a basin by itself!

Note 1 To draw cobwebs on a calculator, graph y D F .x/ on top of y D x: On
a Casio, one way is to plot .x0; x0/ and give the command ÄÁÆ ÈÄÇÌ
¸ followed by
                                 . Now move the cursor vertically to y D F .x/ and press

. Then move horizontally to y D x and press                             . Continue. Each step draws

a line.

  For the TI-81 (and also the Casio) a short program produces a cobweb. Store F .x/

in the D function slot ½. Set the range (square window or autoscaling). Run the

program and answer the prompt with x0:

ÈÖ Ñ Ç Ï                         ×Ô ³³ÁÆÁÌÁ Ä ³³ ÁÒÔÙØ                                    ÐÐ¹Ó

Ä Ò ´Ë¸Ì¸Ì¸Ìµ Ì                                   È Ù× ÓØÓ ½

Note 2 The x's approach x¦ from one side when 0 dF=dx 1:

Note 3 A basin of attraction can include faraway x0's (basins can come in infinitely
many pieces). This makes the problem interesting. If no fixed points are attracting,
see Section 3.7 for "cycles" and "chaos."

     Fig. 3.20 Converging and diverging cobwebs: F .x/ D x2 and F .x/ D x ¡ sin x:

     THE ITERATION xnC1 D Xn ¡ cf .xn/

     At this point we offer the reader a choice. One possibility is to jump ahead to the
     next section on "Newton's Method." That method is an iteration to solve f .x/ D 0:

     The function F .x/ combines xn and f .xn/ and f ½.xn/ into an optimal formula

     for xnC1: We will see how quickly Newton's method works (when it works). It is the
     outstanding algorithm to solve equations, and it is totally built on tangent

     approximations.

       The other possibility is to understand (through calculus) a whole family of
     iterations. This family depends on a number c, which is at our disposal. The best
     choice of c produces Newton's method. I emphasize that iteration is by no means a
     new and peculiar idea. It is a fundamental technique in scientific computing.

       We start by recognizing that there are many ways to reach f .x¦/ D 0: (I write
     x¦ for the solution.) A good algorithm may switch to Newton as it gets close. The

     iterations use f .xn/ to decide on the next point xnC1:

     xnC1 D F .xn/ D xn ¡ cf .xn/:                                                  (2)

     Notice how F .x/ is constructed from f .x/--they are different! We move f to the
     right side and multiply by a "preconditioner" c: The choice of c (or cn, if it changes
     from step to step) is absolutely critical. The starting guess x0 is also important--but
     its accuracy is not always under our control.

       Suppose the xn converge to x¦: Then the limit of equation (2) is

     x¦ D x¦ ¡ cf .x¦/:                                                             (3)

     That gives f .x¦/ D 0: If the xn's have a limit, it solves the right equation. It is a
     fixed point of F (we can assume cn c ¤ 0 and f .xn/ f .x¦/). There are two
     key questions, and both of them are answered by the slope F ½.x¦/:

     1. How quickly does xn approach x¦ (or do the xn diverge) ?

     2. What is a good choice of c (or cn) ?

     EXAMPLE 5 f .x/ D ax ¡ b is zero at x¦ D b=a: The iteration xnC1 D
     xn ¡ c.axn ¡ b/ intends to find b=a without actually dividing. (Early computers
3.6 Iterations xnC1 D F.xn/                                                             183

could not divide; they used iteration.) Subtracting x¦ from both sides leaves an

equation for the error:

xnC1 ¡ x¦ D xn ¡ x¦ ¡ c.axn ¡ b/:

Replace b by ax¦: The right side is .1 ¡ ca/.xn ¡ x¦/: This "error equation" is

(error)nC1 D .1 ¡ ca/(error)n:                                                   (4)

At every step the error is multiplied by .1 ¡ ca/, which is F ½: The error goes to
zero if F ½ is less than 1. The absolute value 1 ¡ ca decides everything:

xn converges to x¦ if and only if ¡1 1 ¡ ca 1:                                   (5)

The perfect choice (if we knew it) is c D 1=a, which turns the multiplier 1 ¡ ca into
zero. Then one iteration gives the exact answer: x1 D x0 ¡ .1=a/.ax0 ¡ b/ D b=a:

That is the horizontal line in Figure 3.21a, converging in one step. But look at the
other lines.

  This example did not need calculus. Linear equations never do. The key idea is that

close to x¦ the nonlinear equation f .x/ D 0 is nearly linear. We apply the tangent

approximation. You are seeing how calculus is used, in a problem that doesn't start
by asking for a derivative.

THE BEST CHOICE OF c

The immediate goal is to study the errors xn ¡ x¦: They go quickly to zero, if
the multiplier is small. To understand xnC1 D xn ¡ cf .xn/, subtract the equation
x¦ D x¦ ¡ cf .x¦/:

xnC1 ¡ x¦ D xn ¡ x¦ ¡ c.f .xn/ ¡ f .x¦//:                                        (6)

Now calculus enters. When you see a difference of f 's think of df =dx: Replace

f .xn/ ¡ f .x¦/ by A.xn ¡ x¦/, where A stands for the slope df =dx at x¦:

xnC1 ¡ x¦ .1 ¡ cA/.xn ¡ x¦/:                                                     (7)

This is the error equation. The new error at step n C 1 is approximately the old error

multiplied by m D 1 ¡ cA: This corresponds to m D 1 ¡ ca in the linear example.

We keep returning to the basic test m D F ½.x¦/ 1:

3K Starting near x¦; the errors xn ¡ x¦ go to zero if multiplier has m  1: The
perfect choice is c D 1=A D 1=f ½.x¦/: Then m D 1 ¡ cA D 0:

  There is only one difficulty: We don't know x¦. Therefore we don't know the
perfect c: It depends on the slope A D f ½.x¦/ at the unknown solution. However we

can come close, by using the slope at xn:

     Choose cn D 1=f ½.xn/: Then xnC1 D xn ¡ f .xn/=f ½.xn/ D F .xn/.

This is Newton's method. The multiplier m D 1 ¡ cA is as near to zero as we can

make it. By building df =dx into F .x/, Newton speeded up the convergence of the
iteration.

     The column with c D 1 is diverging (repelled from x¦). The second column shows
     convergence (attracted to x¦). The third column (Newton's method) approaches x¦

     The first column shows a multiplier below ¡1: The errors grow at every step. Because

     m is negative the errors change sign--the cobweb goes outward.

       The second column shows convergence with m D :018: It takes one genuine
     Newton step, then c is fixed. After n steps the error is closely proportional to
     mn D .:018/n-- that is "linear convergence" with a good multiplier.

       The third column shows the "quadratic convergence" of Newton's method.
     Multiplying the error by m is more attractive than ever, because m 0: In fact m
     itself is proportional to the error, so at each step the error is squared. Problem

     at every step as Newton converges.

                         substitution." The equation f .x/ D 0 is rewritten as x D x ¡ f .x/, and each xn is

                         substituted back to produce xnC1: Iteration with c D 1 does not always fail!

                         Note 2 Newton's method is successive substitution for f =f ½, not f: Then m 0:

                         Note 3 Edwards and Penney happened to choose the same example 2x D cos x:

                         iteration  fits  into  our  family      with  c  D  1  ,  and   it  succeeds.     We    asked    earlier      if  its   limit

                         Note 4 The choice c D 1=f ½.x0/ is "modified Newton." After one step of Newton's
                         method, c is fixed. The steps are quicker, because they don't require a new f ½.xn/:

                         But we need more steps. Millions of dollars are spent on Newton's method, so speed

                         is important. In all its forms, f .x/ D 0 is the central problem of computing.

3.7 Newton's Method (and Chaos)

The equation to be solved is f .x/ D 0: Its solution x¦ is the point where the graph
crosses the x axis. Figure 3.22 shows x¦ and a starting guess x0: Our goal is to come
as close as possible to x¦, based on the information f .x0/ and f ½.x0/.

  Section 3.6 reached Newton's formula for x1 (the next guess). We now do that
directly.

  What do we see at x0 ? The graph has height f .x0/ and slope f ½.x0/: We know

where we are, and which direction the curve is going. We don't know if the curve

bends (we don't have f ¾). The best plan is to follow the tangent line, which uses

all the information we have.
  Newton replaces f .x/ by its linear approximation (D tangent approximation):

f .x/ f .x0/ C f ½.x0/.x ¡ x0/:                                     (1)

We want the left side to be zero. The best we can do is to make the right side zero!

The tangent line crosses the axis at x1, while the curve crosses at x¦: The new guess

x1 comes from f .x0/ C f ½.x0/.x1 ¡ x0/ D 0: Dividing by f ½.x0/ and solving for

x1, this is step 1 of Newton's method:

                       x1 D x0 ¡ f ½f .x0/ .x : (2) 0/

  At this new point, compute f .x1/ and f ½.x1/--the height and slope at x1: They

give a new tangent line, which crosses at x2: At every step we want f .xnC1/ D 0

and we settle for f .xn/ C f ½.xn/.xnC1 ¡ xn/ D 0. After dividing by f ½.xn/, the

formula for xnC1 is Newton's method.

3L The tangent line from xn crosses the axis at xnC1:

            Newton's method xnC1 D xn ¡ f ½f .xn/ .x : (3) n/

Usually this iteration xnC1 D F .xn/ converges quickly to x¦:

Fig. 3.22 Newton's method along tangent lines from x0 to x1 to x2:
188                        3 Applications of the Derivative

       Linear approximation involves three numbers. They are x (across) and f (up)

     and the slope f ½.x/: If we know two of those numbers, we can estimate the third. It

     is remarkable to realize that calculus has now used all three calculations--they are
     the key to this subject:

         1. Estimate the slope f ½.x/ from f =x                                        (Section 2.1)
         2. Estimate the change f from f ½.x/x                                          (Section 3.1)
         3. Estimate the change x from f =f ½.x/                                       (Newton's method)

     The desired f is ¡f .xn/: Formula .3/ is exactly x D ¡f .xn/=f ½.xn/:

     EXAMPLE 1 (Square roots) f .x/ D x2 ¡ b is zero at x¦ D b and also at ¡ b:

     Newton's method is a quick way to find square roots--probably built into your

     calculator. The slope is f ½.xn/ D 2xn, and formula .3/ for the new guess becomes

                           xnC1 D xn ¡ xn D xn 2 ¡ b ¡ 1 xn C b : (4)
                                                  2xn               2        2xn

     This  simplifies  to  xnC1   D  1  .xn  C  b=xn/:  Guess    the   square  root,   divide  into  b;  and
                                     2
     average the two numbers. The ancient Babylonians had this same idea, without

     knowing functions or slopes. They iterated xnC1 D F .xn/:

                                  1 b                            ½ 1 b 
                           F .x/ D 2 x C x and F .x/ D 2 1 ¡ x2 : (5)

     The Babylonians did exactly the right thing. The slope F ½ is zero at the solution,

     when x2 D b: That makes Newton's method converge at high speed. The convergence

     test is F ½.x¦/ 1: Newton achieves F ½.x¦/ D 0--which is superconvergence.

     To find           4,  start  the   iteration      xnC1  D   1  .xn   C  4=xn/    at  x0 D 1:    Then
                                                                 2
            1
     x1  D  2  .1  C  4/:

                   x1 D 2:5 x2 D 2:05 x3 D 2:0006 x4 D 2:000000009:

     The wrong decimal is twice as far out at each step. The error is squared.

     Subtracting x¦ D 2 from both sides of xnC1 D F .xn/ gives an error equation which

     displays that square:

                                        1              4               1
                           xnC1 ¡ 2 D 2 xn C xn ¡ 2 D 2xn .xn ¡ 2/ : (6)
                                                                                    2

     This is .error/nC1    1      .error/2n:  It  explains  the  speed  of  Newton's   method.
                           4

     Remark 1 You can't start this iteration at x0 D 0: The first step computes 4=0
     and blows up. Figure 3.22a shows why--the tangent line at zero is horizontal. It will
     never cross the axis.

     Remark 2 Starting at x0 D ¡1, Newton converges to ¡ 2 instead of C 2: That

     is the other x¦: Often it is difficult to predict which x¦ Newton's method will choose.

     Around every solution is a "basin of attraction," but other parts of the basin may be
     far away. Numerical experiments are needed, with many starts x0: Finding basins of
     attraction was one of the problems that led to fractals.

EXAMPLE 2 Solve 1 ¡ a D 0 to find x¦ D 1 without dividing by a.
                           x                               a

Here f .x/ D .1=x/ ¡ a: Newton uses f ½.x/ D ¡1=x2: Surprisingly, we don't

divide:                                   .1=xn/ ¡ a

Do  these    iterations  converge ?    I  will  take  aD2     and  aim  for  x¦ D    21 :  Subtracting  1
                                                                                                        2
from both sides of .7/ changes the iteration into the error equation:

             xnC1 D 2xn ¡ 2xn2 becomes xnC1 ¡ 21 D ¡2 xn ¡ 21 2 : (8)

At each step the error is squared. This is terrific if (and only if) you are close to
x¦     1                                                                     ¡2
    D  2  :  Otherwise   squaring   a  large  error   and  multiplying  by       is  not   good:

          x0 D :70 x1 D :42 x2 D :487 x3 D :4997 x4 D :4999998

          x0 D 1:21 x1 D ¡:5 x2 D ¡1:5 x3 D ¡7:5 x4 D ¡127:5

The algebra in Problem 18 confirms those experiments. There is fast convergence if
0 x0 1: There is divergence if x0 is negative or x0 1: The tangent line goes to
a negative x1: After that Figure 3.22 shows a long trip backwards.

In the previous section we drew F .x/: The iteration xnC1 D F .xn/ converged to
the 45¥ line, where x¦ D F .x¦/: In this section we are drawing f .x/: Now x¦ is
the point on the axis where f .x¦/ D 0:
To repeat: It is f .x¦/ D 0 that we aim for. But it is the slope F ½.x¦/ that
decides whether we get there. Example 2 has F .x/ D 2x ¡ 2x2: The fixed points are
x¦  D  1                        x¦  D                                         ½.x¦/
       2  (our  solution)  and         0  (not  attractive).  The  slopes  F         are   zero  (typical
Newton) and 2 (typical repeller). The key to Newton's method is F ½ D 0 at the

solution:

The slope of F .x/ D x ¡ f ½f .x/ .x/ is .f ½.x//2 f .x/f : Then F .x/ D 0 when f .x/ D 0: ¾.x/ ½

  The examples x2 D b and 1=x D a show fast convergence or failure. In Chapter 13,
and in reality, Newton's method solves much harder equations. Here I am going to
choose a third example that came from pure curiosity about what might happen. The

results are absolutely amazing. The equation is x2 D ¡1:

EXAMPLE 3 What happens to Newton's method if you ask it to solve
f .x/ D x2 C 1 D 0 ?

The only solutions are the imaginary numbers x¦ D i and x¦ D ¡i: There is no real
square root of ¡1: Newton's method might as well give up. But it has no way to

know that! The tangent line still crosses the axis at a new point xnC1, even if the

curve y D x2 C 1 never crosses. Equation (5) still gives the iteration for b D ¡1:

                                          1 1 
                              xnC1 D xn ¡ D F .xn/:                                               (9)
                                          2           xn

The x's cannot approach i or ¡i (nothing is imaginary). So what do they do ?

  The starting guess x0 D 1 is interesting. It is followed by x1 D 0: Then x2 divides

by zero and blows up. I expected other sequences to go to infinity. But the experiments

showed something different (and mystifying). When xn is large, xnC1 is less than half
190                               3 Applications of the Derivative

     as large. After xn D 10 comes xnC1 D 12 .10 ¡ 101 / D 4:95: After much indecision

     and a long wait, a number near zero eventually appears. Then the next guess divides

     by that small number and goes far out again. This reminded me of "chaos."

     It is tempting to retreat to ordinary examples, where Newton's method is a big

     success. By trying exercises from the book or equations of your own, you will see that

     the fast convergence to 4 is very typical. The function can be much more

     complicated than x2 ¡ 4 (in practice it certainly is). The iteration for 2x D cosx was

     in the previous section, and the error was squared at every step. If Newton's method

     starts close to x¦, its convergence is overwhelming. That has to be the main point of

     this section: Follow the tangent line.
       Instead of those good functions, may I stay with this strange example x2 C 1 D 0 ?

     It is not so predictable, and maybe not so important, but somehow it is more
                                                  x¦,                                                             ¡

     bounces around. We will now discover xn:

     The key is an exercise from trigonometry books. Most of those problems just give
                                                                                        ¡

     In the left equation, the common denominator is 2 sin  cos  (which is sin 2 ). The

     numerator is cos2 ¡ sin2 (which is cos 2 ). Replace cosine=sine by cotangent,

     and the identity says this:

     If x0 D cot  then x1 D cot 2: Then x2 D cot 4 Then xn D cot 2n:

     This is the formula. Our points are on the cotangent curve. Figure 3.23 starts from
     x0 D 2 D cot , and every iteration doubles the angle.

     Example A The sequence x0 D 1; x1 D 0; x2 D matches the cotangents of =4; =2,
     and : This sequence blows up because x2 has a division by x1 D 0:

Eventually one of the angles 4; 8; : : : hits on a large cotangent, and the x's go far
                                                                                             1       31 :
out  again.  This  is  typical.  Examples     A  and    B  were  special,  when  =      was  4   or

  What we have here is chaos. The x's can't converge. They are strongly repelled
by all points. They are also extremely sensitive to the value of : After ten steps  is

multiplied by 210 D 1024: The starting angles 60¥ and 61¥ look close, but now they
are different by 1024¥. If that were a multiple of 180¥, the cotangents would still be

close. In fact the x10's are 0:6 and 14:
  This chaos in mathematics is also seen in nature. The most familiar example is the

weather, which is much more delicate than you might think. The headline "Forecast-
ing Pushed Too Far" appeared in Science .1989/. The article said that the snowballing

of small errors destroys the forecast after six days. We can't follow the weather equa-

tions for a month--the flight of a plane can change everything. This is a revolutionary

idea, that a simple rule can lead to answers that are too sensitive to compute.

  We are accustomed to complicated formulas (or no formulas). We are not
accustomed to innocent-looking formulas like cot 2n , which are absolutely hopeless

after 100 steps.

                                 CHAOS FROM A PARABOLA

Now I get to tell you about new mathematics. First I will change the iteration xnC1 D
1       ¡                                                                                            x2/,
2  .xn     1=xn/   into  one  that  is  even  simpler.  By  switching  from  x   to  z  D  1=.1  C

each new z turns out to involve only the old z and z2:

                                        znC1 D 4zn ¡ 4zn2:                                           (10)

This is the most famous quadratic iteration in the world. There are books about
it, and Problem 28 shows where it comes from. Our formula for xn leads to zn:

                         zn D 2 1 D n 2 1 D .sin 2n /2: (11)
                               1 C xn 1 C .cot 2  /

The sine is just as unpredictable as the cotangent, when 2n gets large. The new thing
is to locate this quadratic as the last member (when a D 4) of the family

                              znC1 D azn ¡ azn2; 0 a 4:                                              (12)

Example 2 happened to be the middle member a D 2, converging to 21 : I would like
to give a brief and very optional report on this iteration, for different a's.

  The general principle is to start with a number z0 between 0 and 1, and compute
z1; z2; z3; : : : : It is fascinating to watch the behavior change as a increases. You can
see it on your own computer. Here we describe some things to look for. All numbers
stay between 0 and 1 and they may approach a limit. That happens when a is small:

                  for 0 a 1 the zn approach z¦ D 0

             for 1 a 3 the zn approach z¦ D .a ¡ 1/=a

Those limit points are the solutions of z D F .z/: They are the fixed points where

z¦ D az¦ ¡ a.z¦/2: But remember the test for approaching a limit: The slope at z¦
cannot be larger than one. Here F D az ¡ az2 has F ½ D a ¡ 2az: It is easy to check

F ½ 1 at the limits predicted above. The hard problem--sometimes impossible--

is to predict what happens above a D 3: Our case is a D 4:

  The z's cannot approach a limit when F ½.z¦/ 1. Something has to happen,

and there are at least three possibilities:
192                        3 Applications of the Derivative

     The zn's can cycle or fill the whole interval .0; 1/ or approach a Cantor set.

     I start with a random number z0, take 100 steps, and write down steps 101 to 105:

                           a D 3:4                        a D 3:5               a D 3:8              a D 4:0

               z101 D             :842                        :875                 :336              :169

               z102 D             :452                        :383                 :848              :562

               z103 D             :842                        :827                 :491              :985

               z104 D             :452                        :501                 :950              :060

               z105 D             :842                        :875                 :182              :225

     The first column is converging to a "2-cycle." It alternates between x D :842 and
     y D :452: Those satisfy y D F .x/ and x D F .y/ D F .F .x//: If we look at a double
     step when a D 3:4; x and y are fixed points of the double iteration znC2 D F .F .zn//:
     When a increases past 3:45, this cycle becomes unstable.

       At that point the period doubles from 2 to 4. With a D 3:5 you see a "4-cycle" in
     the table--it repeats after four steps. The sequence bounces from :875 to :383 to :827
     to :501 and back to :875. This cycle must be attractive or we would not see it. But
     it also becomes unstable as a increases. Next comes an 8-cycle, which is stable in
     a little window (you could compute it) around a D 3:55: The cycles are stable for
     shorter and shorter intervals of a's. Those stability windows are reduced by the
     Feigenbaum shrinking factor 4:6692. . . . Cycles of length 16 and 32 and 64 can be
     seen in physical experiments, but they are all unstable before a D 3:57: What happens

     then ?
       The new and unexpected behavior is between 3:57 and 4: Down each line of

     Figure 3.24, the computer has plotted the values of z1001 to z2000--omitting the
     first thousand points to let a stable period (or chaos) become established. No points

     appeared in the big white wedge. I don't know why. In the window for period 3, you
     see only three z's. Period 3 is followed by 6; 12; 24; . . . . There is period doubling

     at the end of every window (including all the windows that are too small to see). You

     can reproduce this figure by iterating znC1 D azn ¡ azn2 from any z0 and plotting the

     results.

                                  CANTOR SETS AND FRACTALS

     I can't tell what happens at a D 3:8: There may be a stable cycle of some long period.
     The z's may come close to every point between 0 and 1: A third possibility is to
     approach a very thin limit set, which looks like the famous Cantor set:

     To construct the Cantor set, divide OE0; 1 into three pieces and remove the open
     interval 31 ; 32 : Then remove 91 ; 92 and 97 ; 98 from what remains. At each
                                                                              

     step take out the middle thirds. The points that are left form the Cantor set.

     All  the  endpoints   13 ; 23 ; 19 ; 29 , . . . are  in  the  set.   So   is  4  (Problem       42).  Nevertheless
                                                                                   3
     the lengths of the removed intervals add to 1 and the Cantor set has "measure zero."
                                                                                                  1
     What  is  especially  striking  is  its  self-similarity:            Between     0  and      3  you   see  the  same

     Cantor    set  three  times  smaller.    From              0  to  1  the   Cantor   set  is  there    again,  scaled
                                                                       9
     down by 9: Every section, when blown up, copies the larger picture.

     Fractals That self-similarity is typical of a fractal. There is an infinite sequence
     of scales. A mathematical snowflake starts with a triangle and adds a bump in the
     middle of each side. At every step the bumps lengthen the sides by 4=3: The final
     boundary is self-similar, like an infinitely long coastline.

The period 2; 4; : : : is the number of z's in a cycle.

  The word "fractal" comes from fractional dimension. The snowflake boundary

has dimension larger than 1 and smaller than 2: The Cantor set has dimension larger

than 0 and smaller than 1: Covering an ordinary line segment with circles of radius
r would take c=r circles. For fractals it takes c=rD circles--and D is the dimension.

 Our iteration znC1 D 4zn ¡ 4zn2 has a D 4, at the end of Figure 3.24. The sequence

z0; z1;. . . goes everywhere and nowhere. Its behavior is chaotic, and statistical tests
find no pattern. For all practical purposes the numbers are random.

  Think what this means in an experiment (or the stock market). If simple rules
produce chaos, there is absolutely no way to predict the results. No measurement can
ever be sufficiently accurate. The newspapers report that Pluto's orbit is chaotic--
even though it obeys the law of gravity. The motion is totally unpredictable over
long times. I don't know what that does for astronomy (or astrology).

  The most readable book on this subject is Gleick's best-seller Chaos: Making a
New Science. The most dazzling books are The Beauty of Fractals and The Science
194             3 Applications of the Derivative

          of Fractal Images, in which Peitgen and Richter and Saupe show photographs that
          have been in art museums around the world. The most original books are Mandelbrot's
          Fractals and Fractal Geometry. Our cover has a fractal from Figure 13.11.

            We return to friendlier problems in which calculus is not helpless.

                NEWTON'S METHOD VS. SECANT METHOD: CALCULATOR PROGRAMS

          The hard part of Newton's method is to find df =dx: We need it for the slope of the

          tangent line. But calculus can approximate by f =x--using the values of f .x/

          already computed at xn and xn¡1:

            The secant method follows the secant line instead of the tangent line:

          Secant W x f .xn/  f  f .xn/ nC1 D xn ¡ where D ¡ f .xn¡1/ : (13)
                .f =x/n                                            x n  xn ¡ xn¡1

          The secant line connects the two latest points on the graph of f .x/: Its equation

          is y ¡ f .xn/ D .f =x/.x ¡ xn/: Set y D 0 to find equation (13) for the new

          x D xnC1, where the line crosses the axis.

            Prediction: Three secant steps are about as good as two Newton steps. Both should
          give four times as many correct decimals: .error/ .error/4: Probably the secant
          method is also chaotic for x2 C 1 D 0:

            These Newton and secant programs are for the TI-81. Place the formula for f .x/

          in slot ½ and the formula for f ½.x/ in slot ¾ on the D function edit screen.

   3.8 The Mean Value Theorem and l'Hôpital's Rule

Now comes one of the cornerstones of calculus: the Mean Value Theorem. It
connects the local picture (slope at a point) to the global picture (average slope
across an interval). In other words it relates df =dx to f =x: Calculus depends
on this connection, which we saw first for velocities. If the average velocity is 75, is
there a moment when the instantaneous velocity is 75 ?

             Fig. 3.26 (a) v jumps over vaverage: (b) v equals vaverage:

  Without more information, the answer to that question is no. The velocity could
be 100 and then 50--averaging 75 but never equal to 75: If we allow a jump in
velocity, it can jump right over its average. At that moment the velocity does not
exist. (The distance function in Figure 3.26a has no derivative at x D 1:) We will take
away this cheap escape by requiring a derivative at all points inside the interval.

In Figure 3.26b the distance increases by 150 when t increases by 2: There is a

derivative df =dt at all interior points (but an infinite slope at t D 0). The average

velocity is  f D f .2/ ¡ f .0/ D 150 D 75:

             t  2¡0  2

The conclusion of the theorem is that df =dt D 75 at some point inside the

interval. There is at least one point where f ½.c/ D 75:

  This is not a constructive theorem. The value of c is not known. We don't find c,
we just claim (with proof) that such a point exists.

3M Mean Value Theorem Suppose f .x/ is continuous in the closed interval
a x b and has a derivative everywhere in the open interval a x b: Then

           f .b/ ¡ f .a/ D f ½.c/ at some point a c b: (1)
              b¡a

The left side is the average slope f =x: It equals df =dx at c: The notation for a
closed interval [with endpoints] is OEa; b: For an open interval (without endpoints) we

write .a; b/: Thus f ½ is defined in .a; b/, and f remains continuous at a and b: A

derivative is allowed at those endpoints too--but the theorem doesn't require it.

  The proof is based on a special case--when f .a/ D 0 and f .b/ D 0: Suppose the
function starts at zero and returns to zero. The average slope or velocity is zero.

We have to prove that f ½.c/ D 0 at a point in between. This special case (keeping the

assumptions on f .x/) is called Rolle's theorem.

  Geometrically, if f goes away from zero and comes back, then f ½ D 0 at the turn.
198                             3 Applications of the Derivative

       3N Rolle's theorem Suppose f .a/ D f .b/ D 0 (zero at the ends). Then

      f ½.c/ D 0 at some point with a c b:

     Proof At a point inside the interval where f .x/ reaches its maximum or minimum,
     df =dx must be zero. That is an acceptable point c: Figure 3.27a shows the difference

     between f D 0 (assumed at a and b) and f ½ D 0 (proved at c).

       Small problem: The maximum could be reached at the ends a and b, if f .x/ 0 in
     between. At those endpoints df =dx might not be zero. But in that case the minimum
     is reached at an interior point c, which is equally acceptable. The key to our proof is
     that a continuous function on OEa; b reaches its maximum and minimum. This is
     the Extreme Value Theorem.

       It is ironic that Rolle himself did not believe the logic behind calculus. He may not
     have believed his own theorem! Probably he didn't know what it meant--the language
     of "evanescent quantities" (Newton) and "infinitesimals" (Leibniz) was exciting but
     frustrating. Limits were close but never reached. Curves had infinitely many flat sides.
     Rolle didn't accept that reasoning, and what was really serious, he didn't accept the
     conclusions. The Académie des Sciences had to stop his battles (he fought against
     ordinary mathematicians, not Newton and Leibniz). So he went back to number
     theory, but his special case when f .a/ D f .b/ D 0 leads directly to the big one.

            Fig. 3.27 Rolle's theorem is when f .a/ D f .b/ D 0 in the Mean Value Theorem.

     Proof of the Mean Value Theorem We are looking for a point where df =dx equals
     f =x: The idea is to tilt the graph back to Rolle's special case (when f was
     zero). In Figure 3.27b, the distance F .x/ between the curve and the dotted secant line
     comes from subtraction:

                     F .x/ D f .x/ ¡ f .a/ C f  .x ¡ a/ : (2)

                                                             x

     At a and b, this distance is F .a/ D F .b/ D 0: Rolle's theorem applies to F .x/:

     There is an interior point where F ½.c/ D 0: At that point take the derivative of equa-

     tion (2): 0 D f ½.c/ ¡ .f =x/: The desired point c is found, proving the theorem.

     EXAMPLE 1 The function f .x/ D x goes from zero at x D 0 to ten at x D 100:

     Its average slope is f =x D 10=100: The derivative f ½.x/ D 1=2 x exists in

     the open interval .0; 100/, even though it blows up at the end x D 0: By the Mean

     Value Theorem there must be a point where 10=100 D f ½.c/ D 1=2 c: That point

     is c D 25:

      If f .x/ doesn't reach its maximum M; then 1=.M ¡ f .x// would be continuous but also

     approach infinity. Essential fact: A continuous function on OEa; b cannot approach infinity.
         3.8 The Mean Value Theorem and l'Hôpital's Rule                                   199

  The truth is that nobody cares about the exact value of c: Its existence is what

matters. Notice how it affects the linear approximation f .x/ f .a/ C f ½.a/.x ¡

a/, which was basic to this chapter. Close becomes exact ( becomes D) when f ½ is

computed at c instead of a:

3O The derivative at c gives an exact prediction of f .x/:                   (3)
                                                                         c x:
                 f .x/ D f .a/ C f ½.c/.x ¡ a/:

The Mean Value Theorem is rewritten here as f D f ½.c/x: Now a

EXAMPLE 2 The function f .x/ D sin x starts from f .0/ D 0: The linear
prediction (tangent line) uses the slope cos 0 D 1: The exact prediction uses the slope
cos c at an unknown point between 0 and x:

         (approximate) sin x x (exact) sin x D .cos c/x:                 (4)

The approximation is useful, because everything is computed at x D a D 0: The
exact formula is interesting, because cos c 1 proves again that sin x x: The

slope is below 1, so the sine graph stays below the 45¥ line.
EXAMPLE 3 If f ½.c/ D 0 at all points in an interval then f .x/ is constant.
Proof When f ½ is everywhere zero, the theorem gives f D 0: Every pair of points

has f .b/ D f .a/: The graph is a horizontal line. That deceptively simple case is a
key to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

  Most applications of f D f ½.c/x do not end up with a number. They end up

with another theorem (like this one). The goal is to connect derivatives (local) to
differences (global). But the next application--l'Hôpital's Rule--manages to
produce a number out of 0=0:

                        L'HÔPITAL'S RULE

When f .x/ and g.x/ both approach zero, what happens to their ratio f .x/=g.x/ ?

f .x/ D x2 or sin x or x ¡ sin x all become 0 at x D 0:
g.x/ x               x          1 ¡ cos x                  0

Since 0=0 is meaningless, we cannot work separately with f .x/ and g.x/: This is a

"race toward zero," in which two functions become small while their ratio might do

anything. The problem is to find the limit of f .x/=g.x/:

One such limit is already studied. It is the derivative! f =x automatically builds

in a race toward zero, whose limit is df =dx:
         f .x/ ¡ f .a/ 0 but lim f .x/ ¡ f .a/ D f ½.a/: (5)
              x¡ a 0            x a x¡a
The idea of l'Hôpital is to use f ½=g½ to handle f =g: The derivative is the special case
g.x/ D x ¡ a, with g½ D 1: The Rule is followed by examples and proofs.

3P l'Hôpital's Rule Suppose f .x/ and g.x/ both approach zero as x a:

Then f .x/=g.x/ approaches the same limit as f ½.x/=g½.x/, if that second limit

exists:

              f .x/     f ½.x/                                f ½.a/

200             3 Applications of the Derivative

                f .x/           f ½.a/          f .x/     f ½.a/
     Fig. 3.28  (a) g.x/ is exactly g½.a/ D 3:  (b) g.x/ approaches g½.a/ D 3:

     This is not the quotient rule! The derivatives of f .x/ and g.x/ are taken

     separately. Geometrically, l'Hôpital is saying that when functions go to zero their

     slopes control their size. An easy case is f D 6.x ¡ a/ and g D 2.x ¡ a/: The ratio

     f =g is exactly 6=2, the ratio of their slopes. Figure 3.28 shows these straight lines

     dropping to zero, controlled by 6 and 2:

       The next figure shows the same limit 6=2, when the curves are tangent to the lines.

     That picture is the key to l'Hôpital's rule.

      Generally the limit of f =g can be a finite number L or C or ¡ : (Also the limit
     point x D a can represent a finite number or C or ¡ : We keep it finite.) The one

     absolute requirement is that f .x/ and g.x/ must separately approach zero--we insist

     on 0=0: Otherwise there is no reason why equation (6) should be true. With f .x/ D x

     and g.x/ D x ¡ 1, don't use l'Hôpital:

                f .x/ a                         f ½.x/ 1
                g.x/ a ¡ 1 but g½.x/ D 1 :

     Ordinary ratios approach lim f .x/ divided by lim g.x/: l'Hôpital enters only for
     0=0:

     EXAMPLE 4 (an old friend) lim 1 ¡ cos x equals lim sin x : This equals zero.
                                x0 x            x0 1

                f D tan x leads to  f ½ sec2x                             1
     EXAMPLE 5  g sin x             g½ D cos x : At x D 0 the limit is 1 :

     EXAMPLE 6  f D x ¡ sin x leads to f ½ 1 ½ D ¡ cos x : At x D 0 this is still 0 :
                g 1 ¡ cos x             g       sin x                           0

     Solution Apply the Rule to f ½=g½: It has the same limit as f ¾=g¾:

            f0         f½ 0                     f ¾.x/ sin x 0
     if g 0 and g½ 0 then compute g¾.x/ D cos x 1 D 0:

     The reason behind l'Hôpital's Rule is that the following fractions are the

     same:      f .x/ f .x/ ¡ f .a/ g.x/ ¡ g.a/

                g.x/ D x ¡ a x ¡ a : (7)

     That is just algebra; the limit hasn't happened yet. The factors x ¡ a cancel, and the

     numbers f .a/ and g.a/ are zero by assumption. Now take the limit on the right side

     of (7) as x approaches a:
3.8 The Mean Value Theorem and l'Hôpital's Rule                                          201

  What normally happens is that one part approaches f ½ at x D a: The other part
approaches g½.a/: We hope g½.a/ is not zero. In this case we can divide one limit by

the other limit. That gives the "normal" answer

     f .x/                                       f ½.a/
lim         D limit of (7) D ½ :                         (8)
x a g.x/                                         g .a/

This is also l'Hôpital's answer. When f ½.x/ f ½.a/ and separately g½.x/ g½.a/,
his overall limit is f ½.a/=g½.a/: He published this rule in the first textbook ever

written on differential calculus. (That was in 1696--the limit was actually discovered

by his teacher Bernoulli.) Three hundred years later we apply his name to other cases

permitted in .6/; when f ½=g½ might approach a limit even if the separate parts do not.

To prove this more general form of l'Hôpital's Rule, we need a more general Mean

Value Theorem. I regard the discussion below as optional in a calculus course

(but required in a calculus book). The important idea already came in equation (8).

Remark The basic "indeterminate" is ¡ . If f .x/ and g.x/ approach
infinity, anything is possible for f .x/ ¡ g.x/: We could have x2 ¡ x or x ¡ x2 or
.x C 2/ ¡ x: Their limits are and ¡ and 2:

 At the next level are 0=0 and = and 0 ¤ : To find the limit in these cases,

try l'Hôpital's Rule. See Problem 24 when f .x/=g.x/ approaches = : When

f .x/ 0 and g.x/ , apply the 0=0 rule to f .x/=.1=g.x//:
  The next level has 00 and 1 and 0: Those come from limits of f .x/g.x/:

If f .x/ approaches 0; 1; or while g.x/ approaches 0; ; or 0, we need more
information. A really curious example is x1=lnx, which shows all three possibilities
00 and 1 and 0: This function is actually a constant! It equals e:

  To go back down a level, take logarithms. Then g.x/ ln f .x/ returns to 0=0 and

0 ¤ and l'Hôpital's Rule. But logarithms and e have to wait for Chapter 6.

                       THE GENERALIZED MEAN VALUE THEOREM

The MVT can be extended to two functions. The extension is due to Cauchy, who
cleared up the whole idea of limits. You will recognize the special case g D x as the
ordinary Mean Value Theorem.

3Q Generalized MVT If f .x/ and g.x/ are continuous on OEa; b and
differentiable on .a; b/, there is a point a c b where

OEf .b/ ¡ f .a/g½.c/ D OEg.b/ ¡ g.a/f ½.c/:              (9)

The proof comes by constructing a new function that has F .a/ D F .b/:

           F .x/ D OEf .b/ ¡ f .a/g.x/ ¡ OEg.b/ ¡g.a/f .x/:

The ordinary Mean Value Theorem leads to F ½.c/ D 0--which is equation (9).

Application 1 (Proof of l'Hôpital's Rule) The rule deals with f .a/=g.a/ D 0=0:

Inserting those zeros into equation (9) leaves f .b/g½.c/ D g.b/f ½.c/: Therefore
                                  f .b/ f ½.c/
                                  g.b/ D g½.c/ : (10)

As b approaches a, so does c: The point c is squeezed between a and b: The limit of
equation (10) as b a and c a is l'Hôpital's Rule.

                e.x/=g.x/ D e½.C /=g½.C /: This is equation (10) with different letters. After
                checking e½.a/ D g½.a/ D 0, apply the same theorem to e½.x/ and g½.x/: It produces

                a point c between a and C --certainly between a and x--where

     Derivatives by the Chain Rule

     4.1 The Chain Rule

     You remember that the derivative of f .x/g.x/ is not .df =dx/.dg=dx/: The
     derivative of sin x times x2 is not cos x times 2x: The product rule gave two terms,

     not one term. But there is another way of combining the sine function f and the

     squaring function g into a single function. The derivative of that new function does

     involve the cosine times 2x (but with a certain twist). We will first explain the new

     function, and then find the "chain rule" for its derivative.

       May I say here that the chain rule is important. It is easy to learn, and you will

     use it often. I see it as the third basic way to find derivatives of new functions from
     derivatives of old functions. (So far the old functions are xn, sin x, and cos x: Still
     ahead are ex and log x:) When f and g are added and multiplied, derivatives come

     from the sum rule and product rule. This section combines f and g in a third way.
       The new function is sin.x2/--the sine of x2. It is created out of the two original

     functions: if x D 3 then x2 D 9 and sin.x2/ D sin 9: There is a "chain" of functions,
     combining sin x and x2 into the composite function sin.x2/: You start with x, then

     find g.x/, then find f .g.x//:

               The squaring function gives y D x2: This is g.x/:
               The sine function produces z D sin y D sin.x2/: This is f .g.x//:

     The "inside function" g.x/ gives y: This is the input to the "outside function"

     f .y/: That is called composition. It starts with x and ends with z: The composite

     function is sometimes written f ¥ g (the circle shows the difference from an ordinary

     product fg). More often you will see f .g.x//:

     z.x/ D f ¥ g .x/ D f .g.x//:                          (1)

     Other examples are cos 2x and .2x/3, with g D 2x: On a calculator you input x,

     then push the "g" button, then push the "f " button:

     From x compute y D g.x/ From y compute z D f .y/.

204  There is not a button for every function! But the squaring function and sine function
     are on most calculators, and they are used in that order. Figure 4.1a shows how
     squaring will stretch and squeeze the sine function.
                                    4.1 The Chain Rule                                                                  205

  That graph of sin x2 is a crazy FM signal (the Frequency is Modulated). The wave
goes up and down like sin x, but not at the same places. Changing to sin g.x/ moves
the peaks left and right. Compare with a product g.x/ sin x, which is an AM signal
(the Amplitude is Modulated).

Remark f .g.x// is usually different from g.f .x//: The order of f and g is
usually important. For f .x/ D sin x and g.x/ D x2, the chain in the opposite order
g.f .x// gives something different:

                     First apply the sine function: y D sin x
                     Then apply the squaring function: z D .sin x/2:

That result is often written sin2x, to save on parentheses. It is never written sin x2,
which is totally different. Compare them in Figure 4.1.

          Fig. 4.1 f .g.x// is different from g.f .x//: Apply g then f , or f then g:

EXAMPLE 1 The composite function f ¥ g can be deceptive. If g.x/ D x3 and

f .y/ D y4, how does f .g.x// differ from the ordinary product f .x/g.x/? The
ordinary product is x7: The chain starts with y D x3, and then z D y4 D x12: The
composition of x3 and y4 gives f .g.x// D x12:

EXAMPLE 2 In Newton's method, F .x/ is composed with itself. This is

iteration. Every output xn is fed back as input, to find xnC1 D F .xn/: The example
                                                  
F  .x/  D  1  x  C  4  has  F  .F  .x//      D  1   12 x C 4  C  4:    That  produces  z   D     1  x  C  6:
           2                                    2                                                4
                                       21 :                                                41 ,               1
   The    derivative   of  F .x/   is        The   derivative   of  z  D   F .F .x//   is        which    is  2  times

1  :  We  multiply     derivatives.    This     is  a  special  case   of  the  chain  rule.

  An extremely special case is f .x/ D x and g.x/ D x: The ordinary product is x2:
The chain f .g.x// produces only x! The output from the "identity function" is
g.x/ D x: When the second identity function operates on x it produces x again.
The derivative is 1 times 1: I can give more composite functions in a table:

                               y D g.x/            z D f .y/        z D f .g.x//

 A calculator has no button for the identity function. It wouldn't do anything.
206  4 Derivatives by the Chain Rule

     The last one adds 5 to get y: Then it subtracts 5 to reach z: So z D x: Here output
     equals input: f .g.x// D x: These "inverse functions" are in Section 4:3: The other
     examples create new functions z.x/ and we want their derivatives.

                                    THE DERIVATIVE OF f .g.x//

     What is the derivative of z D sin x2? It is the limit of z=x: Therefore we look at a
     nearby point x C x: That change in x produces a change in y D x2--which moves
     to y C y D .x C x/2: From this change in y, there is a change in z D f .y/: It is a
     "domino effect," in which each changed input yields a changed output: x produces
     y produces z: We have to connect the final z to the original x:

       The key is to write z=x as z=y times y=x. Then let x approach
     zero. In the limit, dz=dx is given by the "chain rule":

     z D z y becomes the chain rule dz D dz dy : (2)
     x y x         dx dy dx

     As x goes to zero, the ratio y=x approaches dy=dx: Therefore y must be
     going to zero, and z=y approaches dz=dy: The limit of a product is the product
     of the separate limits (end of quick proof). We multiply derivatives:

     4A Chain Rule Suppose g.x/ has a derivative at x and f .y/ has a derivative
     at y D g.x/: Then the derivative of z D f .g.x// is

                            dz D dz dy D f ½.g.x// g½.x/: (3)

                                dx dy dx
     The slope at x is df =dy (at y) times dg=dx (at x).

     Caution The chain rule does not say that the derivative of sin x2 is .cos x/.2x/:

     True, cos y is the derivative of sin y: The point is that cos y must be evaluated at y
     (not at x). We do not want df =dx at x, we want df =dy at y D x2:

     The derivative of sin x2 is .cos x2/ times .2x/:          (4)

     EXAMPLE 3 If z D .sin x/2 then dz=dx D .2 sin x/.cos x/: Here y D sin x is inside.

     In this order, z D y2 leads to dz=dy D 2y: It does not lead to 2x: The inside
     function sin x produces dy=dx D cos x: The answer is 2y cos x: We have not yet
     found the function whose derivative is 2x cos x:

     EXAMPLE 4 The derivative of z D sin 3x is dz D dz dy D 3 cos 3x:
                                                            dx dy dx

     Fig. 4.2 The chain rule: z D z y approaches dz D dz dy :
            x y x  dx dy dx
                  4.1 The Chain Rule                                                    207

The outside function is z D sin y: The inside function is y D 3x: Then dz=dy D
cos y--this is cos 3x, not cos x: Remember the other factor dy=dx D 3:

  I can explain that factor 3; especially if x is switched to t: The distance is
z D sin 3t: That oscillates like sin t except three times as fast. The speeded-up
function sin 3t completes a wave at time 2=3 (instead of 2). Naturally the
velocity contains the extra factor 3 from the chain rule.

EXAMPLE 5 Let z D f .y/ D yn: Find the derivative of f .g.x// D OEg.x/n:

In this case dz=dy is nyn¡1: The chain rule multiplies by dy=dx:

dz D nyn¡1 dy or d OEg.x/n D nOEg.x/n¡1 dg : (5)
dx  dx            dx                            dx

This is the power rule! It was already discovered in Section 2:5: Square roots (when

n D 1=2) are frequent and important. Suppose y D x2 ¡ 1:

    ddx x2 ¡ 1 D 12 .x2 ¡ 1/¡1=2.2x/ D x x2 ¡ 1 : (6)

Question A Buick uses 1=20 of a gallon of gas per mile. You drive at 60 miles per
hour. How many gallons per hour?
Answer .Gallons=hour/ D .gallons=mile/.miles=hour/: The chain rule is
.dy=dt / D .dy=dx/.dx=dt /: The answer is .1=20/.60/ D 3 gallons=hour:

Proof of the chain rule The discussion above was correctly based on

    z D z y and dz D dz dy : (7)
    x y x             dx dy dx

It was here, over the chain rule, that the "battle of notation" was won by Leibniz.
His notation practically tells you what to do: Take the limit of each term. (I have to
mention that when x is approaching zero, it is theoretically possible that y might
hit zero. If that happens, z=y becomes 0=0: We have to assign it the correct
meaning, which is dz=dy:) As x 0,

y g½.x/ and z f ½.y/ D f ½.g.x//:
x                 y

Then z=x approaches f ½.y/ times g½.x/, which is the chain rule .dz=dy/.dy=dx/:

In the table below, the derivative of .sin x/3 is 3.sin x/2 cos x: That extra factor

cos x is easy to forget. It is even easier to forget the ¡1 in the last example.

    z D .x3 C 1/5 dz=dx D 5.x3 C 1/4 times 3x2

    z D .sin x/3  dz=dx D 3 sin2x       times cos x

    z D .1 ¡ x/2  dz=dx D 2.1 ¡ x/      times ¡ 1

Important All kinds of letters are used for the chain rule. We named the output z:
Very often it is called y, and the inside function is called u:

    The derivative of y D sin u.x/ is dy D cos u du :
                                    dx  dx

Examples with du=dx are extremely common. I have to ask you to accept whatever
letters may come. What never changes is the key idea--derivative of outside function
times derivative of inside function.
208                     4 Derivatives by the Chain Rule

     EXAMPLE 6 The chain rule is barely needed for sin.x ¡ 1/: Strictly speaking the
     inside function is u D x ¡ 1: Then du=dx is just 1 (not ¡1). If y D sin.x ¡ 1/ then
     dy=dx D cos.x ¡ 1/: The graph is shifted and the slope shifts too.

      Notice especially: The cosine is computed at x ¡ 1 and not at the unshifted x:

                                   RECOGNIZING f .y/ AND g.x/

     A big part of the chain rule is recognizing the chain. The table started with .x3 C 1/5:
     You look at it for a second. Then you see it as u5: The inside function is u D x3 C 1:
     With practice this decomposition (the opposite of composition) gets easy:

     cos.2x C 1/ is cos u         1 C sin t is u x sin x is : : : (product rule!)

     In calculations, the careful way is to write down all the functions:

          z D cos u u D 2x C 1 dz=dx D .¡ sin u/.2/ D ¡2 sin.2x C 1/:

     The quick way is to keep in your mind "the derivative of what's inside." The

     slope of cos.2x C 1/ is ¡ sin.2x C 1/, times 2 from the chain rule. The derivative

     of 2x C 1 is remembered--without z or u or f or g:

     EXAMPLE 7 sin 1 ¡ x is a chain of z D sin y; y D u; u D 1 ¡ x (three functions).

     With that triple chain you will have the hang of the chain rule:

            The derivative of sin 1 ¡ x is .cos 1 ¡ x/ 1  .¡1/:
                                              2 1¡x

     This is .dz=dy/.dy=du/.du=dx/: Evaluate them at the right places y; u; x:
       Finally there is the question of second derivatives. The chain rule gives dz=dx as

     a product, so d 2z=dx2 needs the product rule:

                        dz dz dy  d 2z dz d 2y d  dz  dy
                        D leads to 2 D 2 C                                           :  (8)
                        dx dy dx  dx dy dx dx dy dx

                        uv                                          u v½ C u½ v

     That last term needs the chain rule again. It becomes d 2z=dy2 times .dy=dx/2:

     EXAMPLE 8 The derivative of sin x2 is 2x cos x2: Then the product rule gives

     d 2z=dx2 D 2 cos x2 ¡ 4x2 sin x2: In this case y¾ D 2 and .y½/2 D 4x2:

4.2 Implicit Differentiation and Related Rates

We start with the equations xy D 2 and y5 C xy D 3: As x changes, these y's will
change--to keep .x; y/ on the curve. We want to know dy=dx at a typical point.
For xy D 2 that is no trouble, but the slope of y5 C xy D 3 requires a new idea.

 In the first case, solve for y D 2=x and take its derivative: dy=dx D ¡2=x2: The
curve is a hyperbola. At x D 2 the slope is ¡2=4 D ¡1=2:

  The problem with y5 C xy D 3 is that it can't be solved for y: Galois proved that
there is no solution formula for fifth-degree equations. The function y.x/ cannot
be given explicitly. All we have is the implicit definition of y, as a solution to
y5 C xy D 3: The point x D 2, y D 1 satisfies the equation and lies on the curve,
but how to find dy=dx?

  This section answers that question. It is a situation that often occurs. Equations like
sin y C sin x D 1 or y sin y D x (maybe even sin y D x) are difficult or impossible
to solve directly for y: Nevertheless we can find dy=dx at any point.

  The way out is implicit differentiation. Work with the equation as it stands. Find
the x derivative of every term in y5 C xy D 3. That includes the constant term 3;

whose derivative is zero.

EXAMPLE 1 The power rule for y5 and the product rule for xy yield

                                  5y4 dy C x dy C y D 0: (1)
                                       dx dx

Now substitute the typical point x D 2 and y D 1, and solve for dy=dx:

5 dy C 2 dy C 1 D 0 produces dy D ¡ 1 : (2)
dx dx                dx 7

This is implicit differentiation (ID), and you see the idea: Include dy=dx from the

chain rule, even if y is not known explicitly as a function of x:

EXAMPLE 2 sin y C sin x D 1 leads to cos y dy C cos x D 0
                                                        dx

EXAMPLE 3 y sin y D x leads to y cos y dy D sin y dy D 1
             dx      dx

  Knowing the slope makes it easier to draw the curve. We still need points .x; y/
that satisfy the equation. Sometimes we can solve for x: Dividing y5 C xy D 3 by y

gives x D 3=y ¡ y4: Now the derivative (the x derivative!) is

       
  3    3 dy      dy
1 D ¡ y2 ¡ 4y dx D ¡7 dx at y D 1: (3)

Again dy=dx D ¡1=7: All these examples confirm the main point of the section:

4B (Implicit differentiation) An equation F .x; y/ D 0 can be differentiated
directly by the chain rule, without solving for y in terms of x:

The example xy D 2, done implicitly, gives x dy=dx C y D 0: The slope dy=dx is

¡y=x: That agrees with the explicit slope ¡2=x2:

   ID is explained better by examples than theory (maybe everything is). The essential
theory can be boiled down to one idea: "Go ahead and differentiate."

 That was before he went to the famous duel, and met his end. Fourth-degree equations do
have a solution formula, but it is practically never used.
212            4 Derivatives by the Chain Rule

     EXAMPLE 4 Find the tangent direction to the circle x2 C y2 D 25:

     We can solve for y D ¨ 25 ¡ x2, or operate directly on x2 C y2 D 25:

               2x C 2y dy D 0 or dy D ¡ x : (4)
                   dx     dx y

     Compare with the radius, which has slope y=x: The radius goes across x

     and up y: The tangent goes across ¡y and up x: The slopes multiply to give
     .¡x=y/.y=x/ D ¡1:

       To emphasize implicit differentiation, go on to the second derivative. The top of

     the circle is concave down, so d 2y=dx2 is negative. Use the quotient rule on ¡x=y:

     dy D ¡ x so 2 d D 2y ¡ 2 y dx=dx ¡ x dy=dx D ¡ 2 y C.x D 2=y/ ¡ 3 y : (5) 2 Cx2
     dx y      dx      y          y                                        y

                   RELATED RATES

     There is a group of problems that has never found a perfect place in calculus. They

     seem to fit here--as applications of the chain rule. The problem is to compute
     df =dt , but the odd thing is that we are given another derivative dg=dt: To find
     df =dt , we need a relation between f and g:

       The chain rule is df =dt D .df =dg/.dg=dt /: Here the variable is t because that
     is typical in applications. From the rate of change of g we find the rate of change of
     f: This is the problem of related rates, and examples will make the point.

     EXAMPLE 5 The radius of a circle is growing by dr=dt D 7: How fast is the
     circumference growing? Remember that C D 2 r (this relates C to r).

     Solution      dC D dC dr D .2/.7/ D 14:
                   dt dr dt

     That is pretty basic, but its implications are amazing. Suppose you want to put a rope
     around the earth that any 7-footer can walk under. If the distance is 24; 000 miles,
     what is the additional length of the rope? Answer: Only 14 feet.

       More realistically, if two lanes on a circular track are separated by 5 feet, how much
     head start should the outside runner get? Only 10 feet. If your speed around a turn
     is 55 and the car in the next lane goes 56; who wins? See Problem 14:

       Examples 6-8 are from the 1988 Advanced Placement Exams (copyright 1989

     by the College Entrance Examination Board). Their questions are carefully prepared.

dt             dt  dt            dt dt

We used all information, including z D 5, except for dx=dt D 3dy=dt: The term
6dy=dt equals 2dx=dt, so we have 10dx=dt D 10: Answer: dx=dt D 1:

EXAMPLE 7 A person 2 meters tall walks directly away from a streetlight that is
8 meters above the ground. If the person's shadow is lengthening at the rate of 4=9
meters per second, at what rate in meters per second is the person walking?

Solution Draw a figure! You must relate the shadow length s to the distance x
from the streetlight. The problem gives ds=dt D 4=9 and asks for dx=dt :

By similar triangles x D s so dx D 6 ds  D .3/ 4  D 4 :
                   62        dt 2 dt            93

Note This problem was hard. I drew three figures before catching on to x and s:
It is interesting that we never knew x or s or the angle.

EXAMPLE 8 An observer at point A is watching balloon B as it rises from point C:
(The figure is given.) The balloon is rising at a constant rate of 3 meters per second
(this means dy=dt D 3) and the observer is 100 meters from point C:

(a) Find the rate of change in z at the instant when y D 50: (They want dz=dt .)

                                 dt 2 ¤ 50 5 5

(b) Find the rate of change in the area of right triangle BCA when y D 50:

      2                      dt      dt

(c) Find the rate of change in  when y D 50: (They want d=dt:)

               y D 50  cos  D 100 D 2

                                 dt      5 100 125

In all problems I first wrote down a relation from the figure: Then I took its
derivative: Then I substituted known information: (The substitution is after taking
the derivative of tan  D y=100: If we substitute y D 50 too soon; the derivative of
50=100 is useless:)

                EXAMPLE 9 A is a lighthouse and BC is the shoreline (same figure as the balloon).
                The light at A turns once a second .d=dt D 2 radians =second/: How quickly does
                the receiving point B move up the shoreline?

                Solution The figure shows y D 100 tan : The speed dy=dt is 100 sec2 d=dt:
                This is 200 sec2 , so B speeds up as sec  increases.

                Paradox When  approaches a right angle, sec  approaches infinity. So does
                dy=dt: B moves faster than light! This contradicts Einstein's theory of relativity.
                The paradox is resolved (I hope) in Problem 18:

                  If you walk around a light at A, your shadow at B seems to go faster than light.
                Same problem. This speed is impossible--something has been forgotten.

                Smaller paradox (not destroying the theory of relativity). The figure shows y D z sin :
                Apparently dy=dt D .dz=dt / sin : This is totally wrong. Not only is it wrong, the
                exact opposite is true: dz=dt D .dy=dt / sin : If you can explain that (Problem 15),
                then ID and related rates hold no terrors.

               4.3 Inverse Functions and Their Derivatives

     There is a remarkable special case of the chain rule. It occurs when f .y/ and g.x/ are
     "inverse functions." That idea is expressed by a very short and powerful equation:
     f .g.x// D x: Here is what that means.

     Inverse functions: Start with any input, say x D 5: Compute y D g.x/, say
     y D 3: Then compute f .y/, and the answer must be 5. What one function does,
     the inverse function undoes. If g.5/ D 3 then f .3/ D 5: The inverse function f
     takes the output y back to the input x.

     EXAMPLE 1 g.x/ D x ¡ 2 and f .y/ D y C 2 are inverse functions. Starting with

     x D 5, the function g subtracts 2: That produces y D 3: Then the function f adds 2:

     That brings back x D 5. To say it directly: The inverse of y D x ¡ 2 is x D y C 2.

     EXAMPLE 2          y  D     g.x/     D  5  .x  ¡  32/  and       x  D  f  .y/  D  9   y  C  32  are  inverse
                                             9                                         5
     functions (for temperature). Here x is degrees Fahrenheit and y is degrees Celsius.

     From x D 32 (freezing in Fahrenheit) you find y D 0 (freezing in Celsius). The

     inverse function takes y D 0 back to x D 32: Figure 4.4 shows how x D 50¥F
     matches y D 10¥C.

     Notice    that  5  .  x  ¡  3  2  /  subtracts  32  first.  The  inverse  9  y  C  3  2  adds   32  last.  In  the
                     9                                                         5
                                                5                                    59 :
     same way g multiplies last by              9  while f  multiplies first by

     Fig. 4.4  ¥F to ¥C to ¥F. Always g¡1.g.x// D x and g.g¡1 D .y// D y: If f D g¡1 then
               g D f ¡1:

     The inverse function is written f D g¡1 and pronounced "g inverse." It is not

     1=g.x/:

     If the demand y is a function of the price x, then the price is a function of the demand.
     Those are inverse functions. Their derivatives obey a fundamental rule: dy=dx
     times dx=dy equals 1. In Example 2, dy=dx is 5=9 and dx=dy is 9=5:

       There is another important point. When f and g are applied in the opposite
     order, they still come back to the start. First f adds 2, then g subtracts 2: The chain

     g.f .y// D .y C 2/ ¡ 2 brings back y: If f is the inverse of g then g is the inverse

     of f . The relation is completely symmetric, and so is the definition:

     Inverse function: If y D g.x/ then x D g¡1.y/: If x D g¡1.y/ then y D g.x/:
     The loop in the figure goes from x to y to x: The composition g¡1.g.x// is the

     "identity function." Instead of a new point z it returns to the original x: This will
     make the chain rule particularly easy--leading to .dy=dx/.dx=dy/ D 1:

     EXAMPLE 3 y D g.x/ D x and x D f .y/ D y2 are inverse functions.

     Starting from x D 9 we find y D 3: The inverse gives 32 D 9: The square of x is
     f .g.x// D x: In the opposite direction, the square root of y2 is g.f .y// D y:
             4.3 Inverse Functions and Their Derivatives                                                               217

Caution That example does not allow x to be negative. The domain of g--the set
of numbers with square roots--is restricted to x 0: This matches the range of

g¡1: The outputs y2 are nonnegative. With domain of g D range of g¡1, the

equation x D . x/2 is possible and true. The nonnegative x goes into g and comes

out of g¡1:

  In this example y is also nonnegative. You might think we could square anything,
but y must come back as the square root of y2: So y 0:

  To summarize: The domain of a function matches the range of its inverse. The

inputs to g¡1 are the outputs from g: The inputs to g are the outputs from g¡1:

  If g.x/ D y then solving that equation for x gives x D g¡1.y/:

             if y D 3x ¡ 6           then x D 13 .y C 6/       .this is g¡1.y//
                                                               .this is g¡1.y//
             if y D x3 C 1           then x D 3 y ¡ 1

In practice that is how g¡1 is computed: Solve g.x/ D y: This is the reason inverses
are important. Every time we solve an equation we are computing a value of g¡1:

  Not all equations have one solution. Not all functions have inverses. For
each y, the equation g.x/ D y is only allowed to produce one x: That solution is

x D g¡1.y/: If there is a second solution, then g¡1 will not be a function--because

a function cannot produce two x's from the same y:

EXAMPLE 4    There     is  more  than  one  solution    to   sin  x  D  1  :  Many  angles    have      the
                                                                        2
same sine. On the interval 0 x , the inverse of y D sin x is not a function.

Figure 4.5 shows how two x's give the same y:

  Prevent x from passing =2 and the sine has an inverse. Write x D sin¡1y:

  The function g has no inverse if two points x1 and x2 give g.x1/ D g.x2/. Its
inverse would have to bring the same y back to x1 and x2: No function can do that;

g¡1.y/ cannot equal both xl and x2: There must be only one x for each y:

To be invertible over an interval, g must be steadily increasing or steadily decreasing.

Fig. 4.5 Inverse exists (one x for each y). No inverse function (two x's for one y).

                           THE DERIVATIVE OF g¡1

It is time for calculus. Forgive me for this very humble example.

EXAMPLE 5    (ordinary     multiplication)       The  inverse  of  y  D  g.x/  D    3x    is  x  D   f  .y/  D  1  y:
                                                                                                                3

This shows with special clarity the rule for derivatives: The slopes dy=dx D 3 and
          1
dx=dy  D  3  multiply  to  give  1:  This  rule  holds  for  all  inverse     functions,  even   if  their

slopes are not constant. It is a crucial application of the chain rule to the derivative

of f .g.x// D x:
218                                 4 Derivatives by the Chain Rule

     4C (Derivative of inverse function) From f .g.x// D x the chain rule gives

     f ½.g.x//g½.x/ D 1: Writing y D g.x/ and x D f .y/, this rule looks better:

                                   dx dy D 1 or dx D 1 : (1)
                                   dy dx                             dy dy=dx

     The slope of x D g¡1.y/ times the slope of y D g.x/ equals one.

     This is the chain rule with a special feature. Since f .g.x// D x, the derivative of

     both sides is 1: If we know g½ we now know f ½: That rule will be tested on a

     familiar example. In the next section it leads to totally new derivatives.

     EXAMPLE 6 The inverse of y D x3 is x D y1=3: We can find dx=dy two ways:

           directly W dx D 1 y¡2=3                                   dx             1           1            1
                                                   indirectly W D                      D 2 D 2=3 :
                      dy 3                                           dy dy=dx 3x 3y

     The equation .dx=dy/.dy=dx/ D 1 is not ordinary algebra, but it is true. Those
     derivatives are limits of fractions. The fractions are .x=y/.y=x/ D 1 and
     we let x 0:

           Fig. 4.6    Graphs         of  inverse  functions:  x  D  1  y  is  the  mirror  image  of  y  D  3x:
                                                                     3

     Before going to new functions, I want to draw graphs. Figure 4.6 shows y D x

     and y D 3x: What is special is that the same graphs also show the inverse functions.
     The inverse of y D x is x D y2: The pair x D 4; y D 2 is the same for both. That is

     the whole point of inverse functions--if 2 D g.4/ then 4 D g¡1(2). Notice that the

     graphs go steadily up.

       The only problem is, the graph of x D g¡1.y/ is on its side. To change the slope

     from 3 to 31 , you would have to turn the figure. After that turn there is another
     problem--the axes don't point to the right and up. You also have to look in a mirror!

     To keep the book in position, and the typesetter in position, we need a better idea.

     The   graph  of   x    D   1  y  comes     from  turning     the   picture        across  the        line.   The  y
                                3
     axis becomes horizontal and x goes upward. The point .2; 6/ on the line y D 3x goes

     (Figure 4.6c). The mathematics sees the same pairs x and y: The special properties
     of g and g¡1 allow us to know two functions--and draw two graphs--at the same
     time. The graph of x D g¡1.y/ is the mirror image of the graph of y D g.x/.

      I have seen graphs with y D g.x/ and also y D g¡1.x/: For me that is wrong: it has to be
     x D g¡1.y/: If y D sin x then x D sin¡1y:

                                  EXPONENTIALS AND LOGARITHMS

I would like to add two more examples of inverse functions, because they are so

important. Both examples involve the exponential and the logarithm. One is made
up of linear pieces that imitate 2x; it appeared in Chapter 1: The other is the true
function 2x, which is not yet defined--and it is not going to be defined here. The
functions bx and logb y are so overwhelmingly important that they deserve and will

get a whole chapter of the book (at least). But you have to see the graphs.

   The slopes in the linear model are powers of 2: So are the heights y at the start

of each piece. The slopes 1; 2; 4; : : : equal the heights 1; 2; 4; : : : at those special

points.

  The inverse is a discrete model for the logarithm (to base 2). The logarithm of 1
is 0, because 20 D 1: The logarithm of 2 is 1, because 21 D 2: The logarithm of 2j

is the exponent j: Thus the model gives the correct x D log2 y at the breakpoints
                                                        1     1     1
y  D  1;  2;  4;  8;  :  :  :  :  The  slopes  are  1;  2  ;  4  ;  8  ;  :  :  :  because    d  x  =dy  D  1=.dy  =d  x  /:

   The model is good, but the real thing is better. The figure on the right shows the

true exponential y D 2x: At x D 0; 1; 2; : : : the heights y are the same as before. But

now   the  height           at    xD   1  is  the  number        21=2,             which  is        2: The height at x D :10
                                       2
is the tenth root 21=10 D 1:07 : : :: The slope at x D 0 is no longer 1--it is closer to

y=x D :07=:10: The exact slope is a number c (near .7) that we are not

yet prepared to reveal.
  The special property of y D 2x is that the slope at all points is cy: The slope is

proportional to the function. The exponential solves dy=dx D cy:

   Now look at the inverse function--the logarithm. Its graph is the mirror image:

           If y D 2x then x D log2 y: If 21=10 1:07 then log2 1:07 1=10:

What the exponential does, the logarithm undoes--and vice versa. The logarithm of
2x is the exponent x. Since the exponential starts with slope c, the logarithm must

start with slope 1=c: Check that numerically. The logarithm of 1:07 is near 1=10: The

slope is near .10=:07: The beautiful property is that dx=dy D 1=cy:

Fig. 4.7 Piecewise linear models and smooth curves: y D 2x and x D log2 y: Base b D 2:

  I have to mention that calculus avoids logarithms to base 2: The reason lies

in that mysterious number c: It is the "natural logarithm" of 2, which is .693147 : : :

--and who wants that? Also 1=:693147 : : : enters the slope of log2 y: Then
.dx=dy/.dy=dx/ D 1: The right choice is to use "natural logarithms" throughout.

In place of 2, they are based on the special number e:

                                       y D ex is the inverse of x D ln y:                                                     (2)
220             4 Derivatives by the Chain Rule

      The derivatives of those functions are sensational--they are saved for Chapter 6.
     Together with xn and sin x and cos x, they are the backbone of calculus.

     Note It is almost possible to go directly to Chapter 6: The inverse functions

     x D sin¡1y and x D tan¡1y can be done quickly. The reason for including integrals

     first (Chapter 5) is that they solve differential equations with no guesswork:

     dy D y or dx D 1                     ÷ ÷ dy        or x D ln y C C:
                       leads to                dx D
     dx         dy y                                 y

     Integrals have applications of all kinds, spread through the rest of the book. But do
     not lose sight of 2x and ex: They solve dy=dx D cy--the key to applied calculus.

                                 THE INVERSE OF A CHAIN h.g.x//

     The functions g.x/ D x ¡ 2 and h.y/ D 3y were easy to invert. For g¡1 we added 2,

     and for h¡1 we divided by 3: Now the question is: If we create the composite function

     z D h.g.x//, or z D 3.x ¡ 2/, what is its inverse?

       Virtually all known functions are created in this way, from chains of simpler
     functions. The problem is to invert a chain using the inverse of each piece. The
     answer is one of the fundamental rules of mathematics:

     4D The inverse of z D h.g.x// is a chain of inverses in the opposite order:

                       x D g¡1.h¡1.z//:                                           (3)

     h¡1 is applied first because h was applied last: g¡1.h¡1.h.g.x//// D x:

       That last equation looks like a mess, but it holds the key. In the middle you see

     h¡1 and h: That part of the chain does nothing! The inverse functions cancel, to
     leave g¡1.g.x//: But that is x. The whole chain collapses, when g¡1 and h¡1 are

     in the correct order--which is opposite to the order of h.g.x//:

     EXAMPLE 7  z D h.g.x// D 3.x ¡ 2/    and  x  D  g¡1.h¡1.z//  D  1  z  C  2:
                                                                     3

     First h¡1 divides by 3: Then g¡1 adds 2: The inverse of h ¥ g is g¡1 ¥ h¡1: It can
     be found directly by solving z D 3.x ¡ 2/. A chain of inverses is like writing in

     prose--we do it without knowing it.

     EXAMPLE 8 Invert z D x ¡ 2 by writing z2 D x ¡ 2 and then x D z2 C 2:

     The inverse adds 2 and takes the square--but not in that order. That would give
     .z C 2/2, which is wrong. The correct order is z2 C 2:

       The domains and ranges are explained by Figure 4.8. We start with x 2:
     Subtracting 2 gives y 0: Taking the square root gives z 0: Taking the square
     brings back y 0: Adding 2 brings back x 2--which is in the original domain
     of g:

         Fig. 4.8 The chain g¡1.h¡1.h.g.x//// D x is one-to-one at every step.

                                EXAMPLE 9 Inverse matrices .AB/¡1 D B¡1A¡1 (this linear algebra is optional).

                                Suppose a vector x is multiplied by a square matrix B: y D g.x/ D Bx: The inverse

                                function multiplies by the inverse matrix: x D g¡1.y/ D B¡1y: It is like
                                multiplication by B D 3 and B¡1 D 1=3, except that x and y are vectors.

                                  Now suppose a second function multiplies by another matrix A: z D h.g.x// D ABx:
                                The problem is to recover x from z: The first step is to invert A, because that came

                                last: Bx D A¡1z: Then the second step multiplies by B¡1 and brings back
                                x D B¡1A¡1z: The product B¡1A¡1 inverts the product AB. The rule for matrix

                                inverses is like the rule for function inverses--in fact it is a special case.
                                  I had better not wander too far from calculus. The next section introduces the

                                inverses of the sine and cosine and tangent, and finds their derivatives. Remember
                                that the ultimate source is the chain rule.

          4.4 Inverses of Trigonometric Functions

Mathematics is built on basic functions like the sine, and on basic ideas like the
inverse. Therefore it is totally natural to invert the sine function. The graph of

x D sin¡1y is a mirror image of y D sin x: This is a case where we pay close

attention to the domains, since the sine goes up and down infinitely often. We only
want one piece of that curve, in Figure 4.9.

 For the bold line the domain is restricted. The angle x lies between ¡=2

and C=2. On that interval the sine is increasing, so each y comes from exactly
one angle x. If the whole sine curve is allowed, infinitely many angles would have
sin x D 0: The sine function could not have an inverse. By restricting to an interval
where sin x is increasing, we make the function invertible.

     Fig. 4.9 Graphs of sin x and sin¡1y: Their slopes are cos x and 1= 1 ¡ y2:

The inverse function brings y back to x: It is x D sin¡1y (the inverse sine):

                    x D sin¡1y when y D sin x and x =2:                                        (1)

The inverse starts with a number y between ¡1 and 1: It produces an angle x D
sin¡1y--the angle whose sine is y. The angle x is between ¡=2 and =2, with

the required sine. Historically x was called the "arc sine" of y, and arcsin is used in
computing. The mathematical notation is sin¡1: This has nothing to do with 1= sin x.
                         30¥
The  figure  shows  the       angle  x  D  =6:  Its  sine  is  y  D  21 :  The  inverse  sine  of  1
is =6. Again: The symbol sin¡1.1/ stands for the angle whose sine is 1 (this angle                 2

is x D =2). We are seeing g¡1.g.x// D x:

sin¡1.sin x/ D x for ¡  x                       sin.sin¡1y/ D y for ¡ 1 y 1:
                              2            2

EXAMPLE 1 (important) If sin x D y find a formula for cos x:

Solution We are given the sine, we want the cosine. The key to this problem must

be cos2x D 1 ¡ sin2x: When the sine is y, the cosine is the square root of 1 ¡ y2:

                         cos x D cos.sin¡1y/ D 1 ¡ y2:                                         (2)

This formula is crucial for computing derivatives. We use it immediately.
224  4 Derivatives by the Chain Rule

                               THE DERIVATIVE OF THE INVERSE SINE

     The calculus problem is to find the slope of the inverse function f .y/ D sin¡1y:

     The chain rule gives (slope of inverse function) D 1=(slope of original function).
     Certainly the slope of sin x is cos x: To switch from x to y, use equation (2):

           y D sin x gives dy dx D cos x so that dx dy D 1 cos x D 1 1 ¡ y2 : (3)

     This derivative 1= 1 ¡ y2 gives a new v-f pair that is extremely valuable in

     calculus:

             velocity v.t/ D 1= 1 ¡ t2 distance f .t/ D sin¡1t:

     Inverse functions will soon produce two more pairs, from the derivatives of tan¡1y
     and sec¡1y: The table at the end lists all the essential facts.

     EXAMPLE 2 The slope of sin¡1y at y D 1 is infinite: 1= 1 ¡ y2 D 1=0: Explain.

     At y D 1 the graph of y D sin x is horizontal. The slope is zero. So its mirror image
     is vertical. The slope 1=0 is an extreme case of the chain rule.

     Question What is d=dx.sin¡1x/? Answer 1= 1 ¡ x2: I just changed letters.

     THE INVERSE COSINE AND ITS DERIVATIVE

     Whatever is done for the sine can be done for the cosine. But the domain and range

     have to be watched. The graph cannot be allowed to go up and down. Each y from

     ¡1 to 1 should be the cosine of only one angle x: That puts x between 0 and :

     Then the cosine is steadily decreasing and y D cos x has an inverse:

     cos¡1.cos x/ D x and cos.cos¡1y/ D y:                (4)

     The cosine of the angle x D 0 is the number y D 1: The inverse cosine of y D 1 is the
     angle x D 0: Those both express the same fact, that cos 0 D 1:

       For the slope of cos¡1y, we could copy the calculation that succeeded for sin¡1y:

     The chain rule could be applied as in (3). But there is a faster way, because of a special

     relation between cos¡1y and sin¡1y: Those angles always add to a right angle:

     cos¡1y C sin¡1y D =2:                                (5)

     Figure 4.9c shows the angles and Figure 4.10c shows the graphs. The sum is =2 (the

     dotted line), and its derivative is zero. So the derivatives of cos¡1y and sin¡1y must

     add to zero. Those derivatives have opposite sign. There is a minus for the inverse
     cosine, and its graph goes downward:

     The derivative of x D cos¡1y is dx=dy D ¡1= 1 ¡ y2:  (6)

     Question How can two functions x D sin¡1y and x D ¡cos¡1y have the same

     derivative?

     Answer sin¡1y must be the same as ¡cos¡1y C C: Equation (5) gives C D =2:

                      THE INVERSE TANGENT AND ITS DERIVATIVE

The tangent is sin x= cos x: The inverse tangent is not sin¡1y=cos¡1y: The inverse

function produces the angle whose tangent is y: Figure 4.11 shows that angle, which

is between ¡=2 and =2: The tangent can be any number, but the inverse tangent is
in the open interval ¡=2 x =2: (The interval is "open" because its endpoints

                              ¡=2 are not defined.

         Important Soon will come the following question. What function has the
         derivative 1=.1 C x2/? One reason for reading this section is to learn the answer.

         The function is in equation (8)--if we change letters. It is f .x/ D tan¡1x that has

         slope 1=.1 C x2/.

         Fig. 4.12 cos2x C sin2x D 1 and 1 C tan2x D sec2x and 1 C cot2x D csc2x:

             INVERSE COTANGENT, INVERSE SECANT, INVERSE COSECANT

         There is no way we can avoid completing this miserable list! But it can be painless.

         The idea is to use 1=.dy=dx/ for y D cot x and y D sec x and y D csc x:

                  dx D 2 ¡1 and dx D 1                      and dx D ¡1 : (9)
                  dy csc x                 dy sec x tan x                dy csc x cot x

         In the middle equation, replace sec x by y and tan x by ¨ y2 ¡ 1: Choose the sign

         for positive slope (compare Figure 4.11). That gives the middle equation in (10):

             The derivatives of cot¡1y and sec¡1y and csc¡1y are

     d .cot¡1y/ D 2 ¡1    d .sec¡1y/ D              1       ddy .csc¡1y/ D ¡1 y y2 ¡ 1 : (10)

                                                    y2 ¡ 1

         Note about the inverse secant When y is negative there is a choice for x D sec¡1y:

         We selected the angle in the second quadrant (between =2 and ). Its cosine is

         negative, so its secant is negative. This choice makes sec¡1y D cos¡1.1=y/, which
         matches sec x D 1= cos x: It also makes sec¡1y an increasing function, where cos¡1y

         is a decreasing function. So we needed the absolute value y in the derivative.

           Some mathematical tables make a different choice. The angle x could be in the

         third quadrant (between ¡ and ¡=2). Then the slope omits the absolute value.

         Summary For the six inverse functions it is only necessary to learn three

         derivatives. The other three just have minus signs, as we saw for sin¡1y and cos¡1y:

         Each inverse function and its "cofunction" add to =2, so their derivatives add to
         zero. Here are the six functions for quick reference, with the three new derivatives.

                           Integrals

   5.1 The Idea of the Integral

This chapter is about the idea of integration, and also about the technique of

integration. We explain how it is done in principle, and then how it is done in

practice. Integration is a problem of adding up infinitely many things, each of which

is infinitesimally small. Doing the addition is not recommended. The whole point of

calculus is to offer a better way.

   The problem of integration is to find a limit of sums. The key is to work backward

from a limit of differences (which is the derivative). We can integrate v.x/ if it

turns up as the derivative of another function f .x/. The integral of v D cos x is
                                             1
f  D sin x. The integral of v D x   is f  D  2  x  2  .  Basically,  f  .x  /  is  an  "antiderivative".

The list of f 's will grow much longer (Section 5:4 is crucial). A selection is inside

the cover of this book. If we don't find a suitable f .x/, numerical integration can still

give an excellent answer.

   I could go directly to the formulas for integrals, which allow you to compute areas

under the most amazing curves. (Area is the clearest example of adding up infinitely

many infinitely thin rectangles, so it always comes first. It is certainly not the only

problem that integral calculus can solve.) But I am really unwilling just to write down

formulas, and skip over all the ideas. Newton and Leibniz had an absolutely brilliant

intuition, and there is no reason why we can't share it.

   They started with something simple. We will do the same.

                                    SUMS AND DIFFERENCES                                                  229

Integrals and derivatives can be mostly explained by working (very briefly) with
sums and differences. Instead of functions, we have n ordinary numbers. The key
idea is nothing more than a basic fact of algebra. In the limit as n , it becomes
the basic fact of calculus. The step of "going to the limit" is the essential difference
between algebra and calculus! It has to be taken, in order to add up infinitely many
infinitesimals--but we start out this side of it.

  To see what happens before the limiting step, we need two sets of n numbers. The
first set will be v1; v2; : : : ; vn, where v suggests velocity. The second set of numbers
will be f1; f2; : : : ; fn; where f recalls the idea of distance. You might think d would
be a better symbol for distance, but that is needed for the dx and dy of calculus.
230                                            5 Integrals

     A first example has n D 4:

                     v1; v2; v3; v4 D 1; 2; 3; 4 f1; f2; f3; f4 D 1; 3; 6; 10:

       The relation between the v's and f 's is seen in that example. When you are given
     1; 3; 6; 10; how do you produce 1; 2; 3; 4? By taking differences. The difference

     between 10 and 6 is 4. Subtracting 6 ¡ 3 is 3. The difference f2 ¡ f1 D 3 ¡ 1 is

     v2 D 2. Each v is the difference between two f 's:

                       vj is the difference fj ¡ fj ¡1:

     This is the discrete form of the derivative. I admit to a small difficulty at j D 1,

     from the fact that there is no f0. The first v should be f1 ¡ f0, and the natural idea

     is to agree that f0 is zero. This need for a starting point will come back to haunt us
     (or help us) in calculus.

       Now look again at those same numbers--but start with v. From v D 1; 2; 3; 4 how
     do you produce f D 1; 3; 6; 10? By taking sums. The first two v's add to 3, which is
     f2. The first three v's add to f3 D 6. The sum of all four v's is 1 C 2 C 3 C 4 D 10.
     Taking sums is the opposite of taking differences.

       That idea from algebra is the key to calculus. The sum fj involves all the numbers

     v1 C v2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C vj . The difference vj involves only the two numbers fj ¡ fj ¡1. The

     fact that one reverses the other is the "Fundamental Theorem." Calculus will change
     sums to integrals and differences to derivatives--but why not let the key idea come
     through now?

       5A Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (before limits):

             If each vj D fj ¡ fj ¡1; then v1 C v2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C vn D fn ¡ f0:

     The differences of the f 's add up to fn ¡ f0. All f 's in between are canceled, leaving

     only the last fn and the starting f0. The sum "telescopes":

     v1 C v2 C v3 C ¤ ¤ ¤C vn D .f1 ¡ f0/ C .f2 ¡ f1/ C .f3 ¡ f2/ C ¤ ¤ ¤C .fn ¡ fn¡1/:
     The number f1 is canceled by ¡f1. Similarly ¡f2 cancels f2 and ¡f3 cancels f3.
     Eventually fn and ¡f0 are left. When f0 is zero, the sum is the final fn.

       That completes the algebra. We add the v's by finding the f 's.

     Question How do you add the odd numbers 1 C 3 C 5 C ¤ ¤ ¤C 99 (the v's)?

     Answer They are the differences between 0; 1; 4; 9; : : : : These f 's are squares. By
     the Fundamental Theorem, the sum of 50 odd numbers is .50/2.

       The tricky part is to discover the right f 's! Their differences must produce the v's.
     In calculus, the tricky part is to find the right f .x/. Its derivative must produce v.x/.
     It is remarkable how often f can be found--more often for integrals than for sums.
     Our next step is to understand how the integral is a limit of sums.

                                      SUMS APPROACH INTEGRALS

     Suppose you start a successful company. The rate of income is increasing. After x
     years, the income per year is x million dollars. In the first four years you reach

       1; 2; 3; and 4 million dollars. Those numbers are displayed in a bar graph
     (Figure 5.1a, for investors). I realize that most start-up companies make losses, but
     your company is an exception. If the example is too good to be true, please keep
     reading.
                    5.1 The Idea of the Integral                                                        231

              Fig. 5.1 Total income D total area of rectangles D 6:15.

  The graph shows four rectangles, of heights 1; 2; 3; 4. Since the base of
each rectangle is one year, those numbers are also the areas of the rectangles. One
investor, possibly weak in arithmetic, asks a simple question: What is the total
income for all four years? There are two ways to answer, and I will give both.

  The first answer is 1 C 2 C 3 C 4. Addition gives 6:15 million dollars.
Figure 5.1b shows this total--which is reached at year 4. This is exactly like
velocities and distances, but now v is the income per year and f is the total income.

Algebraically, fj is still v1 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C vj .

  The second answer comes from geometry. The total income is the total area of the
rectangles. We are emphasizing the correspondence between addition and area. That
point may seem obvious, but it becomes important when a second investor (smarter
than the first) asks a harder question.

   Here is the problem. The incomes as stated are false. The company did not make

a million dollars the first year. After three months, when x was 1=4; the rate of income

was only x D 1=2. The bar graph showed 1 D 1 for the whole year, but that was

an overstatement. The income in three months was not more than 1=2 times 1=4; the

rate multiplied by the time.

   All other quarters and years were also overstated. Figure 5.2a is closer to reality,

with 4 years divided into 16 quarters. It gives a new estimate for total income.

 Again there are two ways to find the total. We add 1=4 C 2=4 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C 16=4,

remembering to multiply them all by 1=4 (because each rate applies to 1=4 year).

This is also the area of the 16 rectangles. The area approach is better because the 1=4

is automatic. Each rectangle has base 1=4; so that factor enters each area. The total

area is now 5:56 million dollars, closer to the truth.

   You see what is coming. The next step divides time into weeks. After one week

the rate x only 1=52. That is the height of the first rectangle--its base is x D

1=52. There is a rectangle for every week. Then a hard-working investor divides time

into days, and the base of each rectangle is x D 1=365. At that point there are
   ¢                                                                                                 1

     million dollars. The calculation is elementary but depressing--adding up thousands
     of square roots, each multiplied by x from the base. There has to be a better way.

     The better way, in fact the best way, is calculus. The whole idea is to allow for

     continuous change: The geometry problem is to find the area under the square

     root curve. That question cannot be answered by arithmetic, because it involves a

     limit. The rectangles have base x and heights x; 2x; : : :; 4. There are

     4=x rectangles--more and more terms from thinner and thinner rectangles. The

     area is the limit of the sum as x 0.                                                                 1

                            5.2 Antiderivatives

     The symbol was invented by Leibniz to represent the integral. It is a stretched-out
     S, from the Latin word for sum. This symbol is a powerful reminder of the whole
     construction: Sum approaches integral, S approaches , and rectangular area
     approaches curved area:

                            curved area D v.x/ dx D x dx:       (1)

     The rectangles of base x lead to this limit--the integral of x. The "dx" indicates

     that x approaches zero. The heights vj of the rectangles are the heights v.x/ of
     the curve. The sum of vj times x approaches "the integral of v of x dx." You can
     imagine an infinitely thin rectangle above every point, instead of ordinary rectangles

     above special points.

       We now find the area under the square root curve. The "limits of integration" are
     0 and 4. The lower limit is x D 0, where the area begins. (The start could be any
     point x D a.) The upper limit is x D 4, since we stop after four years. (The finish
     could be any point x D b.) The area of the rectangles is a sum of base x times

     heights x. The curved area is the limit of this sum. That limit is the integral of

     x from 0 to 4:

                                                 i ÷ xD4

                                                           xD0

     The outstanding problem of integral calculus is still to be solved. What is this limiting

     area? We have a symbol for the answer, involving and x and dx--but we don't

     have a number.

                                             THE ANTIDERIVATIVE

     I wish I knew who discovered the area under the graph of x. It may have been
     Newton. The answer was available earlier, but the key idea was shared by Newton
     and Leibniz. They understood the parallels between sums and integrals, and between
     differences and derivatives. I can give the answer, by following that analogy. I can't
     give the proof (yet)--it is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

      In algebra the difference fj ¡ fj ¡1 is vj . When we add, the sum of the v's is
     fn ¡ f0. In calculus the derivative of f .x/ is v.x/. When we integrate, the area

     under the v.x/ curve is f .x/ minus f .0/. Our problem asks for the area out to x D
     4:

     5B (Discrete vs. continuous, rectangles vs. curved areas, addition vs. integration)
     The integral of v.x/ is the difference in f .x/:

           If df =dx D x then area D xD0 xD4 x dx D f .4/ ¡ f .0/: (3)

     What is f .x/? Instead of the derivative of x, we need its "antiderivative." We
     have to find a function f .x/ whose derivative is x. It is the opposite of Chapters

     2 ¡ 4; and requires us to work backwards. The derivative of xn is nxn¡1--now

     we need the antiderivative. The quick formula is f .x/ D xnC1=.n C 1/--we aim to
     understand it.

     Solution Since the derivative lowers the exponent, the antiderivative raises it. We
     go from x1=2 to x3=2. But then the derivative is .3=2/x1=2. It contains an unwanted
     factor 3=2. To cancel that factor, put 2=3 into the antiderivative:

        f      .x/  D  2  x3=2  has   the  required     derivative     v.x/     D  x1=2  D  x:

        Fig. 5.3 The integral of v.x/ D x is the exact area 16=3 under the curve.

There you see the key to integrals: Work backward from derivatives (and adjust).
  Now comes a number--the exact area. At x D 4 we find x3=2 D 8. Multiply by 2=3

to get 16=3. Then subtract f .0/ D 0:

                    ÷ xD4 x dx D 2 .4/3=2 ¡ 2 .0/3=2 D 2 .8/ D 16 (4)

f .0/. The sum from thousands of rectangles was slowly approaching this exact area
5 13 .

Other areas The income in the first year, at x D 1, is 23 .1/3=2 D 23 million dollars.
(The false income was 1 million dollars.) The total income after x years is 23 .x/3=2,
which is the antiderivative f .x/. The square root curve covers 2=3 of the overall
rectangle it sits in. The rectangle goes out to x and up to x, with area x3=2, and

2=3 of that rectangle is below the curve. (1=3 is above.)

Other antiderivatives The derivative of x5 is 5x4. Therefore the antiderivative of
x4 is x5=5. Divide by 5 (or n C 1) to cancel the 5 (or n C 1) from the derivative. And

don't allow n C 1 D 0:

        The derivative v.x/ D xn has the antiderivative f .x/ D xnC1=.n C 1/:

EXAMPLE 1 The antiderivative of x2 is 13 x3. This is the area under the parabola

v.x/ D x2. The area out to x D 1 is 13 .1/3 ¡ 13 .0/3, or 1=3.

Remark on x and x2 The 2=3 from x and the 1=3 from x2 add to 1. Those are
the areas below and above the x curve, in the corner of Figure 5.3. If you turn

the curve by 90¥, it becomes the parabola. The functions y D x and x D y2 are

inverses! The areas for these inverse functions add to a square of area 1.

                                  AREA UNDER A STRAIGHT LINE

     You already know the area of a triangle. The region is below the diagonal line v D x
                                                                                       1

     not required! But if you allow calculus to repeat that answer, and build up the integral
     f .x/ D 12 x2 as the limiting area of many rectangles, you will have the beginning of
     something important.

       The four rectangles have area 1 C 2 C 3 C 4 D 10. That is greater than 8, because
     the triangle is inside. 10 is a first approximation to the triangular area 8, and to
     improve it we need more rectangles.

       The next rectangles will be thinner, of width x D 1=2 instead of the original
     x D 1. There will be eight rectangles instead of four. They extend above the line, so
     the answer is still too high. The new heights are 1=2, 1, 3=2, 2, 5=2, 3, 7=2, 4. The
     total area in Figure 5.4b is the sum of the base x D 1=2 times those heights:

     Answer      With  base  x        D   4  the   area  is  4

     The effort of doing the addition is increasing. A formula for the sums is needed, and
     will be established soon. (The next answer would be 8 14 .) But more important than
     the formula is the idea. We are carrying out a Iimiting process, one step at a time.
     The area of the rectangles is approaching the area of the triangle, as x decreases.
     The same limiting process will apply to other areas, in which the region is much more
     complicated. Therefore we pause to comment on what is important.

     Area Under a Curve
       What requirements are imposed on those thinner and thinner rectangles? It is not

     essential that they all have the same width. And it is not required that they cover the
     triangle completely. The rectangles could lie below the curve. The limiting answer
     will still be 8, even if the widths x are unequal and the rectangles fit inside the
     triangle or across it. We only impose two rules:

         1. The largest width xmax must approach zero.
         2. The top of each rectangle must touch or cross the curve.
                                        5.2 Antiderivatives                                                                       237

The area under the graph is defined to be the limit of these rectangular areas, if that
limit exists. For the straight line, the limit does exist and equals 8. That limit is
independent of the particular widths and heights--as we absolutely insist it should be.

  Section 5.5 allows any continuous v.x/. The question will be the same--Does the
limit exist? The answer will be the same--Yes. That limit will be the integral of
v.x/, and it will be the area under the curve. It will be f .x/.

EXAMPLE 2          The      triangular  area  from    0      to  x  is  1  .  b  a  se/  .  h  e  ig  h  t/  D  21 .x/.x/.  That

is  f  .x/  D  2       Its  derivative  is   v.x/ D x.       But    notice          that                        has  the  same

derivative. So does f D 12 x2 C C , for any constant C . There is a "constant of
integration" in f .x/, which is wiped out in its derivative v.x/.

EXAMPLE 3 Suppose the velocity is decreasing: v.x/ D 4 ¡ x. If we sample v at

x D 1; 2; 3; 4; the rectangles lie under the graph. Because v is decreasing, the right

end of each interval gives vmin. Then the rectangular area 3 C 2 C 1 C 0 D 6 is less

than the exact area 8. The rectangles are inside the triangle, and eight rectangles with
       1
base   2  come    closer:

                       rectangular   area    D     21 .3 21  C3C¤¤¤C                1  C 0/ D 7:

Sixteen rectangles would have area 7 21 . We repeat that the rectangles need not have
the same widths x, but it makes these calculations easier.

  What is the area out to an arbitrary point (like x D 3 or x D 1)? We could insert
rectangles, but the Fundamental Theorem offers a faster way. Any antiderivative

of 4 ¡ x will give the area. We look for a function whose derivative is 4 ¡ x. The

derivative of 4x is 4, the derivative of 12 x2 is x, so work backward:

                   to  achieve   df  =dx     D  4  ¡  x  choose         f  .x/      D  4x      ¡      1  x2:

1 and x D 3 is the difference 7 21 ¡ 3 21 D 4. In Figure 5.5, this is the area of the

  The f-curve flattens out when the v-curve touches zero. No new area is being

                                          INDEFINITE INTEGRALS AND DEFINITE INTEGRALS

     We have to distinguish two different kinds of integrals. They both use the antideriva-

                              The   indefinite        integral    is   a   function       f  .x/   D     4x    ¡     1  x2.
                                                                                                                     2
                              The definite integral from x D 0 to x D 4 is the number f .4/ ¡ f .0/.

     The definite integral is definitely 8. But the indefinite integral is not necessarily

     4x ¡ 12 x2. We can change f .x/ by a constant without changing its derivative

     (since the derivative of a constant is zero). The following functions are also antideriva-

     tives:

     f                  .  x  /  D  4  x  ¡  1  x  2  C  1  ;     f  .  x  /  D  4  x  ¡  1  x  2  ¡  9  ;           f  .  x  /  D  4  x  ¡   1  x  2  C  C  :
                                             2                                            2                                                   2

     The first two are particular examples. The last is the general case. The constant C

     can be anything (including zero), to give all functions with the required derivative.

     The theory of calculus will show that there are no others. The indefinite integral is

     the most general antiderivative (with no limits):

                                          indefinite integral f .x/ D                  v  .x    /  d  x  D     4  x  ¡  1  x     2  C  C  :               (5)
                                                                                                                        2

     By contrast, the definite integral is a number. It contains no arbitrary constant C .

     More that that, it contains no variable x. The definite integral is determined by the

     function v.x/ and the limits of integration (also known as the endpoints). It is the

     area under the graph between those endpoints.

     To see the relation of indefinite to definite, answer this question: What is the defi-
                                                                                                                                                       1
     nite               integral       between        x  D     1  and  x   D  3?    The   indefinite        integral       gives       f  .3/  D    7  2  C  C

     and f .1/ D 3 21 C C . To find the area between the limits, subtract f at one limit
     from f at the other limit:

                                          3     v.x/     dx    D  f  .3/   ¡  f  .1/   D  .7    1  C  C     /  ¡  .3    1  C     C  /  D  4:              (6)
                                          xD1                                                   2                       2

     The constant cancels itself! The definite integral is the difference between the values
     of the indefinite integral. C disappears in the subtraction.

      The difference f .3/ ¡ f .1/ is like fn ¡ f0. The sum of vj from 1 to n has become

     "the integral of v.x/ from 1 to 3." Section 5.3 computes other areas from sums, and
     5:4 computes many more from antiderivatives. Then we come back to the definite

     integral and the Fundamental Theorem:

                   5.3 Summation versus Integration

     This section does integration the hard way. We find explicit formulas for

     fn D v1 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C vn: From areas of rectangles, the limits produce the area f .x/

     under a curve. According to the Fundamental Theorem, df =dx should return
     us to v.x/--and we verify in each case that it does.

       May I recall that there is sometimes an easier way? If we can find an f .x/ whose
     derivative is v.x/, then the integral of v is f: Sums and limits are not required, when
     f is spotted directly. The next section, which explains how to look for f .x/, will
     displace this one. (If we can't find an antiderivative we fall back on summation.)
     Given a successful f; adding any constant produces another f --since the derivative
     of the constant is zero. The right constant achieves f .0/ D 0, with no extra effort.

       This section constructs f .x/ from sums. The next section searches for antiderivatives.

                                      THE SIGMA NOTATION

     In a section about sums, there has to be a decent way to express them. Consider
     12 C 22 C 32 C 42: The individual terms are vj D j 2: Their sum can be written in

     summation notation, using the capital Greek letter  (pronounced sigma):

                                                                              4

                                                             X
                            12 C 22 C 32 C 42 is written j 2:

                                                                           j D1

     Spoken aloud, that becomes "the sum of j 2 from j D 1 to 4." It equals 30: The
     limits on j (written below and above ) indicate where to start and stop:

                 v1 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C vn D X vj and v3 C n ¤ ¤ ¤C v9 D X vk: (1) 9

                                      j D1                                       kD3

     The k at the end of (1) makes an additional point. There is nothing special about the
     letter j: That is a "dummy variable," no better and no worse than k (or i ). Dummy
     variables are only on one side (the side with ), and they have no effect on the sum.
     The upper limit n is on both sides. Here are six sums:

     P k D 1 C 2 C 3 C n ¤ ¤ ¤C n                    P . 4 ¡1/j D ¡1 C 1 ¡ 1 C 1 D 0

     kD1                                             j D1

     j D1                                            i D0

     i D1

     The numbers 1 and n or 1 and 4 (or 0 and ) are the lower limit and upper

     limit. The dummy variable i or j or k is the index of summation. I hope it seems
                                                  1     1  C¤¤¤

     in Chapter 10.
     A sum like nj D16 looks meaningless, but it is actually 6 C 6 C ¤ ¤ ¤C 6 D 6n: It

     follows the rules. In fact 4iD1j 2 is not meaningless either. Every term is j 2 and by

      Zeno the Greek believed it was impossible to get anywhere, since he would only go halfway
     and then half again and half again. Infinite series would have changed his whole life.
5.3 Summation versus Integration                                                         241

the same rules, that sum is 4j 2: However the i was probably intended to be j: Then
the sum is 1 C 4 C 9 C 16 D 30:

Question What happens to these sums when the upper limits are changed to n?
Answer The sum depends on the stopping point n. A formula is required (when
possible). Integrals stop at x, sums stop at n, and we now look for special cases when
f .x/ or fn can be found.

                              A SPECIAL SUMMATION FORMULA

How do you add the first 100 whole numbers? The problem is to compute

X j D 1 C 2 C 3 C 100 ¤ ¤ ¤C 98 C 99 C 100 D<

j D1

If you were Gauss, you would see the answer at once. (He solved this problem at a

ridiculous age, which gave his friends the idea of getting him into another class.)
His solution was to combine 1 C 100, and 2 C 99, and 3 C 98, always adding to 101.
There are fifty of those combinations. Thus the sum is .50/.101/ D 5050.

  The sum from 1 to n uses the same idea. The first and last terms add to n C 1: The

next terms n ¡ 1 and 2 also add to n C 1: If n is even (as 100 was) then there are 21 n

parts. Therefore the sum is 21 n times n C 1:

            X j D 1 C 2 C n ¤ ¤ ¤C .n ¡ 1/ C n D 1 n.n C 1/: (2)

                    j D1 2

The important term is 12 n2, but the exact sum is 12 n2 C 12 n:
  What happens if n is an odd number (like n D 99)? Formula (2) remains true. The

combinations 1 C 99 and 2 C 98 still add to n C 1 D 100: There are 12 .99/ D 49 12
such pairs, because the middle term (which is 50) has nothing to combine with. Thus

1 C 2 C ¤ ¤ ¤C 99 equals 49 12 times 100, or 4950.

Remark That sum had to be 4950; because it is 5050 minus 100: The sum up to 99

equals the sum up to 100 with the last term removed. Our key formula fn ¡ fn¡1 D

vn has turned up again!

EXAMPLE Find the sum 101 C 102 C ¤ ¤ ¤C 200 of the second hundred numbers.

First solution This is the sum from 1 to 200 minus the sum from 1 to 100 W

X j D j 200 X 200 ¡ X j: (3) 100

101  1  1

The middle sum is 21 .200/.201/ and the last is 21 .100/.101/: Their difference is
15050:
Note! I left out "j D" in the limits. It is there, but not written.

Second solution The answer 15050 is exactly the sum of the first hundred numbers
(which was 5050) plus an additional 10000: Believing that a number like 10000 can
never turn up by accident, we look for a reason. It is found through changing the
limits of summation:

                                                                                                               (4)

                                j D101                              kD1

     This is important, to be able to shift limits around. Often the lower limit is moved

     to zero or one, for convenience. Both sums have 100 terms (that doesn't change).

     The dummy variable j is replaced by another dummy variable k: They are related by

     j D k C 100 or equivalently by k D j ¡ 100:

       The variable must change everywhere--in the lower limit and the upper limit

     as well as inside the sum. If j starts at 101; then k D j ¡ 100 starts at 1: If j ends

     at 200; k ends at 100: If j appears in the sum, it is replaced by k C 100 (and if j 2
     appeared it would become .k C 100/2/:

      From equation (4) you see why the answer is 15050: The sum 1 C 2 C ¤ ¤ ¤C 100 is

     5050 as before. 100 is added to each of those 100 terms. That gives 10000:

     EXAMPLES OF CHANGING THE VARIABLE (and the limits)

     P 2 3 i equals P 2 4 j ¡1          (here i D j ¡ 1). Both sums are 1 C 2 C 4 C 8
                                        (here i D j C 3 and j D i ¡ 3). Both sums are v3 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C vn:
     i D0         j D1

      n           nP¡3
           vi equals vj C3
     P

     i D3         j D0

     Why change n to n ¡ 3? Because the upper limit is i D n: So j C 3 D n and j D
     n ¡ 3:

       A final step is possible, and you will often see it. The new variable j can be

     changed back to i: Dummy variables have no meaning of their own, but at first the

     result looks surprising:

                                X 2i equals 2j 5 X6 ¡1 equals X 2i 6 ¡1:

                                i D0              j D1                       i D1

     With practice you might do that in one step, skipping the temporary letter j: Every i

     on the left becomes i ¡ 1 on the right. Then i D 0; : : :; 5 changes to i D 1; : : :; 6: (At

     first two steps are safer.) This may seem a minor point, but soon we will be changing
     the limits on integrals instead of sums. Integration is parallel to summation, and it is

     better to see a "change of variable" here first.

     Note about 1 C 2 C ¤ ¤ ¤C n: The good thing is that Gauss found the sum 21 n.n C 1/:

     The bad thing is that his method looked too much like a trick. I would like to show

     how this fits the fundamental rule connecting sums and differences:

                        if v1 C v2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C vn D fn then vn D fn ¡ fn¡1:                                      (5)

     Gauss  says  that  fn  is  1  n.n  C  1/:  Reducing    n  by   1,  his  formula  for    fn¡1   is  1  .n  ¡ 1/n:
     The difference fn ¡ fn¡1 should be the last term n in the sum:2                                    2

            fn    ¡  fn¡1   D      1  n.n  C  1/  ¡  1  .n  ¡  1/n  D   1  .n2  C  n  ¡  n2  C  n/  D   n:     (6)
                                   2                 2                  2

     This is the one term vn D n that is included in fn but not in fn¡1:

       There is a deeper point here. For any sum fn; there are two things to check. The
     f 's must begin correctly and they must change correctly. The underlying idea is
     mathematical induction: Assume the statement is true below n: Prove it for n.
                                   5.3 Summation versus Integration                                                                  243

Goal:       To    prove     that   1   C   2  C     ¤  ¤  ¤  C  n  D  1  n.n    C  1/:  This   is  the   guess  fn.

Proof by induction: Check f1 (it equals 1). Check fn ¡ fn¡1(it equals n).

For   n  D  1     the    answer        12 n.n C 1/           D  1  ¤1¤2    is   correct.  For  n   D  2  this  formula   1    ¤2¤3
                                                                2                                                        2
agrees with 1 C 2: But that separate test is not necessary! If f1 is right, and if the
change fn ¡ fn¡1 is right for every n; then fn must be right. Equation (6) was
the key test, to show that the change in f 's agrees with v:

   That is the logic behind mathematical induction, but I am not happy with most of

the exercises that use it. There is absolutely no excitement. The answer is given by

some higher power (like Gauss), and it is proved correct by some lower power (like

us). It is much better when we lower powers find the answer for ourselves. Therefore

I will try to do that for the second problem, which is the sum of squares.

                      THE SUM OF j 2 AND THE INTEGRAL OF x2

An important calculation comes next. It is the area in Figure 5.6. One region is made
up of rectangles, so its area is a sum of n pieces. The other region lies under the
parabola v D x2: It cannot be divided into rectangles, and calculus is needed.

 The first problem is to find fn D 12 C 22 C 32 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C n2: This is a sum of squares,

with f1 D 1 and f2 D 5 and f3 D 14: The goal is to find the pattern in that sequence.
By trying to guess fn we are copying what will soon be done for integrals.

  Calculus looks for an f .x/ whose derivative is v.x/: There f is an antiderivative

                                                                                                   
Fig. 5.6 Rectangles enclosing v D x2 have area 13 n3 C 12 n2 C 16 n .x/3 13 .nx/3 D 13 x3:

(or an integral). Algebra looks for fn's whose differences produce vn: Here fn could

be called an antidifference (better to call it a sum).

   The best start is a good guess. Copying directly from integrals, we might try
         1                                                                          ¡
fn  D    3  n3:      To  test  if  it  is  right,      check       whether      fn     fn¡1    produces   on    vn  D    n2:

                  1  n3  ¡  1  .n  ¡   1/3    D     1  n3    ¡     1  .n3  ¡   3n2  C   3n  ¡  1/  D  n2  ¡  n  C  1  :

We    see   n2,      but   also    ¡n      C  1  :  The      guess       13 n3  needs   correction       terms.    To    cancel   1

in the difference, I subtract 31 n from the sum. To put back n in the difference, I add

certain, verify that fn ¡ fn¡1 D n2: For calculus the important term is 13 n3:

244                                             5 Integrals

           The sum Pn j 2 of the first n squares is 1 n3 plus corrections 1 n2 and 1 n:
                                                                3                       2     6
                        j D1

           In practice 13 n3 is an excellent estimate. The sum of the first 100 squares is
           approximately 13 .100/3, or a third of a million. If we need the exact answer,
           equation (7) is available: the sum is 338; 350: Many applications (example: the
           number of steps to solve 100 linear equations) can settle for 13 n3:

             What is fascinating is the contrast with calculus. Calculus has no correction terms!
           They get washed away in the limit of thin rectangles. When the sum is replaced by
           the integral (the area), we get an absolutely clean answer:

                        The integral of v D x2 from x D 0 to x D n is exactly 13 n3.

           The area under the parabola, out to the point x D 100, is precisely a third of a million.

           We have to explain why, with many rectangles.

           The idea is to approach an infinite number of infinitely thin rectangles. A hundred

           rectangles gave an area of 338; 350: Now take a thousand rectangles. Their heights

           are 101 2 ; 102 2 ; : : : because the curve is v D x2: The base of every rectangle is
                 1
           x  D  10  ,  and  we  add  heights  times  base:

            area of rectangles D 1 2  1   C 2 2  1   C ¤ ¤ ¤ C 10002  1  :
                                      10 10                  10 10                      10    10

           Factor out 101 3 : What you have left is 12 C 22 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C 10002, which fits the sum of

           squares formula. The exact area of the thousand rectangles is 333; 833:5: I could try
           to guess ten thousand rectangles but I won't.

           Main point: The area is approaching 333; 333:333 : : :: But the calculations are getting
           worse. It is time for algebra--which means that we keep "x" and avoid numbers.

             The interval of length 100 is divided into n pieces of length x: (Thus n D 100=x:)
           The j th rectangle meets the curve v D x2, so its height is .jx/2: Its base is x,

           and we add areas:

            area D .x/2.x/ C .2x/2.x/ C ¤ ¤ ¤C .nx/2.x/ D X.jx/2.x/: n

                                                                                                                     j D1

           Factor out .x/3, leaving a sum of n squares. The area is .x/3 times fn; and n D : (8) 100

           This equation shows what is happening. The leading term is a third of a million,

           as predicted. The other terms are approaching zero! They contain x, and as the

           rectangles get thinner they disappear. They only account for the small corners of

           rectangles that lie above the curve. The vanishing of those corners will eventually be

           proved for any continuous functions--the area from the correction terms goes to

           zero--but here in equation (9) you see it explicitly.

           The area under the curve came from the central idea of integration: 100=x
                                                                       1
           rectangles   of  width  x  approach  the   limiting  areaD  3  .100/3:  The  rectangular  area

           is  vj x: The exact area is v.x/dx: In the limit  becomes and vj be-

           comes v.x/ and x becomes dx:

   That completes the calculation for a parabola. It used the formula for a sum of

squares, which was special. But the underlying idea is much more general. The

limit of the sums agrees with the antiderivative: The antiderivative of v.x/ D x2 is
           1
f  .x/  D  3  x3.  According      to  the  Fundamental    Theorem,       the  area  under  v.x/  is  f  .x/:

                        0100v.x/ dx D f .100/ ¡ f .0/ D 31 .100/3:

That Fundamental Theorem is not yet proved! I mean it is not proved by us. Whether

Leibniz or Newton managed to prove it, I am not quite sure. But it can be done. Start-

ing from sums of differences, the difficulty is that we have too many limits at once.
The sums of vj x are approaching the integral. The differences f =x approach
the derivative. A real proof has to separate those steps, and Section 5.7 will do it.

  Proved or not, you are seeing the main point. What was true for the numbers fj
and vj is true in the limit for v.x/ and f .x/: Now v.x/ can vary continuously, but it
is still the slope of f .x/: The reverse of slope is area.

 Finally we review the area under v D x: The sum of 1 C 2 C ¤ ¤ ¤C n is 12 n2 C 12 n:

This gives the area of n D 4=x rectangles, going out to x D 4: The heights are

With    x  D  1    the  area  is  1  C  2  C  3  C  4  D  10:  With  eight  rectangles  and  x   D   1  ,  the
                                                                                                     2

area  was  8 C 2x D 9:            Sixteen     rectangles  of   width  4  brought    the  correction     2x

down to 21 : The exact area is 8: The error is proportional to x.

Important note There you see a question in applied mathematics. If there is an

error, what size is it? How does it behave as x 0? The x term disappears in

the limit, and .x/2 disappears faster. But to get an error of 10¡6 we need eight

million rectangles: 2x D 2 ¤ 4=8; 000; 000 D 10¡6:

That is horrifying! The numbers 10; 9; 8 21; 8 14 ; : : : seem to approach the area 8 in
a satisfactory way, but the convergence is much too slow. It takes twice as much

work to get one more binary digit in the answer--which is absolutely unacceptable.
Somehow the x term must be removed. If the correction is .x/2 instead of x,

then a thousand rectangles will reach an accuracy of 10¡6:

   The problem is that the rectangles are unbalanced. Their right sides touch the

graph of v, but their left sides are much too high. The best is to cross the graph in

the middle of the interval--this is the midpoint rule. Then the rectangle sits halfway

across the line v D x, and the error is zero. Section 5.8 comes back to this rule--and
to Simpson's rule that fits parabolas and removes the .x/2 term and is built into

many calculators.

       Finally we try the quick way. The area under v D x is f D 12 x2, because df =dx
     is v: The area out to x D 4 is 12 .4/2 D 8: Done.

                          x 0                                     pC1
             xD0                     j D1

     Calculus doesn't care if the upper limit n is an integer, and it doesn't care if the
     power p is an integer. We only need p C 1 0 to be sure npC1 is genuinely the
     leading term. The antiderivative of v D xp is f D xpC1=.p C 1/.

     We are close to interesting experiments. The correction terms disappear and the sum

     approaches the integral. Here are actual numbers for p D 1, when the sum and integral
     are easy: Sn D 1 C ¤ ¤ ¤C n and In D            1                                   1

     thing to watch is the relative error En D Dn=In:

             n    Sn      In Dn D Sn ¡ In En D Dn=In

             100 5050 5000                           50           :010

             200 20100 20000                      100             :005

     The number 20; 100 is 21 .200/.201/: Please write down the next line n D 400, and
     please find a formula for En. You can guess En from the table, or you can derive

     it from knowing Sn and In: The formula should show that En goes to zero. More

     important, it should show how quick (or slow) that convergence will be.

       One more number--a third of a million--was mentioned earlier. It came from
     integrating x2 from 0 to 100, which compares to the sum S100 of 100 squares:

             np       Sn  In D 13 n3 D D S ¡ I E D D=I

             200 2 2686700 2666666 32 20033 31 :0075125

     These numbers suggest a new idea, to keep n fixed and change p. The computer can
     find sums without a formula! With its help we go to fourth powers and square roots:

                              In this and future tables we don't expect exact values. The last entries are rounded
                              off, and the goal is to see the pattern. The errors En;p are sure to obey a systematic
                              rule--they are proportional to 1=n and to an unknown number C.p/ that depends on
                              p: I hope you can push the experiments far enough to discover C.p/: This is not an
                              exercise with an answer in the back of the book--it is mathematics.

5.4 Indefinite Integrals and Substitutions

This section integrates the easy way, by looking for antiderivatives. We leave aside
sums of rectangular areas, and their limits as x 0: Instead we search for an f .x/
with the required derivative v.x/: In practice, this approach is more or less
independent of the approach through sums--but it gives the same answer. And also,
the search for an antiderivative may not succeed. We may not find f: In that case
we go back to rectangles, or on to something better in Section 5.8.

  A computer is ready to integrate v, but not by discovering f: It integrates
between specified limits, to obtain a number (the definite integral). Here we hope
to find a function (the indefinite integral). That requires a symbolic integration code
like MACSYMA or Mathematica or MAPLE, or a reasonably nice v.x/, or both.
An expression for f .x/ can have tremendous advantages over a list of numbers.

  Thus our goal is to find antiderivatives and use them. The techniques will be further
developed in Chapter 7--this section is short but good. First we write down what
we know. On each line, f .x/ is an antiderivative of v.x/ because df =dx D v.x/.

                           1= x x2 ¡ 1       sec¡1x C C

You recognize that each integration formula came directly from a differentiation
formula. The integral of the cosine is the sine, because the derivative of the sine is
the cosine. For emphasis we list three derivatives above three integrals:

d (constant)D 0    d .x/ D1     d  x D xn nC1 
dx                dx            dx nC1

         0 dx DC    1 dx Dx CC

   There are two ways to make this list longer. One is to find the derivative of a new
f .x/: Then f goes in one column and v D df =dx goes in the other co1umn. The
other possibility is to use rules for derivatives to find rules for integrals. That is the
way to extend the list, enormously and easily.

 We will soon meet ex, which goes in both columns. It is f .x/ and also v.x/:

                              RULES FOR INTEGRALS

     Among the rules for derivatives, three were of supreme importance. They were
     linearity, the product rule, and the chain rule. Everything flowed from those three.
     In the reverse direction (from v to f ) this is still true. The three basic methods of
     differential calculus also dominate integral calculus:

                       linearity of derivatives  linearity of integrals
                 product rule for derivatives    integration by parts
                                                 integrals by substitution
                   chain rule for derivatives

     The easiest is linearity, which comes first. Integration by parts will be left for
     Section 7.1. This section starts on substitutions, reversing the chain rule to make an
     integral simpler.

                              LINEARITY OF INTEGRALS

     What is the integral of v.x/ C w.x/? Add the two separate integrals. The graph of
     v C w has two regions below it, the area under v and the area from v to v C w:
     Adding areas gives the sum rule. Suppose f and g are antiderivatives of v and w:

     sum rule:        f Cg    is an antiderivative of   vCw
     constant rule:     cf    is an antiderivative of     cv
     linearity:               is an antiderivative of
                     af C bg                           av Cbw

     This is a case of overkill. The first two rules are special cases of the third, so logically
     the last rule is enough. However it is so important to deal quickly with constants-- just
     "factor them out"--that the rule cv cf is stated separately. The proofs come from

     the linearity of derivatives: .af C bg/½ equals af ½ C bg½ which equals av C bw.

     The rules can be restated with integral signs:

     sum rule:       v.x/ C w.x/dx D v.x/ dx C w.x/ dx

     constant rule:           cv.x/ dx D c v.x/ dx

     linearity:      av.x/ C bw.x/dx D a v.x/ dx C b w.x/ dx

     Note about the constant in f .x/ C C . All antiderivatives allow the addition of a
     constant. For a combination like av.x/ C bw.x/, the antiderivative is
     af .x/ C bg.x/ C C: The constants for each part combine into a single constant.
     To give all possible antiderivatives of a function, just remember to write "CC " after

     one of them. The real problem is to find that one antiderivative.

     EXAMPLE 1 The antiderivative of v D x2 C x¡2 is f D x3=3 C .x¡1/=.¡1/ C C:
     EXAMPLE 2 The antiderivative of 6 cos t C 7 sin t is 6 sin t ¡ 7 cos t C C:
     EXAMPLE 3 Rewrite 1 1 ¡ sin x as 1 ¡ sin2 1 ¡ sin xx D cos2 1 ¡ sin x x D sec2x ¡ sec x tan x:
     The antiderivative is tan x ¡ sec x C C: That rewriting is done by a symbolic algebra

     code (or by you). Differentiation is often simple, so most people check that
     df =dx D v.x/:

                   INTEGRALS BY SUBSTITUTION

We now present the most valuable technique in this section--substitution. To see the
idea, you have to remember the chain rule:

                  f .g.x// has derivative f ½.g.x//.dg=dx/

                        sin x2 has derivative .cos x2/.2x/
                    .x3 C 1/5 has derivative 5.x3 C 1/4.3x2/

If the function on the right is given, the function on the left is its antiderivative!
There are two points to emphasize right away:

1. Constants are no problem--they can always be fixed. Divide by 2 or 15:

÷                  1                           ÷

   x cos.x/2dx D sin.x / C C2                    x2.x3 C 1/4dx D 1 .x3 C 1/5 C C
                                                                       15
                   2

Notice the 2 from x2, the 5 from the fifth power, and the 3 from x3:

2. Choosing the inside function g (or u) commits us to its derivative:

   the integral of 2x cos x2 is sin x2 C C                .g D x2; dg=dx D 2x/
   the integral of cos x2 is (failure)                    .no dg=dx/
   the integral of x2 cos x2 is (failure)                 .wrong dg=dx/

To substitute g for x2, we need its derivative. The trick is to spot an inside function
whose derivative is present. We can fix constants like 2 or 15; but otherwise dg=dx
has to be there. Very often the inside function g is written u. We use that letter to
state the substitution rule, when f is the integral of v:

                   ÷ du
                      v.u.x// dx D f .u.x// C C:                                            (1)
                               dx

EXAMPLE 4  sin  x  cos  x  dx  D  1  .sin  x/2    C  C          u D sin x (compare Example 6)
                                  2

EXAMPLE 5  sin2x cos x dx D 31 .sin x/3 C C                     u D sin x
EXAMPLE 6                                                       u D cos x (compare Example 4)
           cos x sin x dx D ¡ 21 .cos x/2 C C

EXAMPLE 7  tan4x   sec2x   dx  D     1  .tan   x/5  C  C        u D tan x
                                     5

The next example has u D x2 ¡ 1 and du=dx D 2x: The key step is choosing u:

EXAMPLE 8 x dx= x2 ¡ 1 D x2 ¡ 1C C                           x  x2  ¡  1  dx  D  1  .x2  ¡  1/3=2  C  C
                                                                                 3

A shift of x (to x C 2) or a multiple of x (rescaling to 2x) is particularly easy:

EXAMPLES 9-10      .x   C  2/3dx  D     1  .x  C  2/4  C  C     cos    2x  dx  D    1  sin  2x  C  C
                                        4                                           2

You will soon be able to do those in your sleep. Officially the derivative of .x C 2/4
uses the chain rule. But the inside function u D x C 2 has du=dx D 1: The "1" is

there automatically, and the graph shifts over--as in Figure 5.8b.
  For Example 10 the inside function is u D 2x: Its derivative is du=dx D 2: This

     Fig. 5.8 Substituting u D x C 1 and u D 2x and u D x2: The last graph has half of du=dx D 2x:

     required factor 2 is missing in cos 2x dx, but we put it there by multiplying and

     dividing   by    2:  Check  the  derivative   of  1  sin  2x:  the  2  from  the   chain  rule  cancels  the
                                                       2
     1
     2  :  The  rule  for  any  nonzero  constant    is  similar:

                      ÷ ÷1
                          v.x C c/ dx D f .x C c/ and v.cx/ dx D f .cx/:                                      (2)
                                                                                        c

     Squeezing the graph by c divides the area by c: Now 3x C 7 rescales and shifts:

     EXAMPLE 11                 cos.3x  C  7/  dx  D   1  sin.3x   C   7/  C  C      .3x   C  7/2dx  D  1  ¤  1  .3x  C  7/3  C  C
                                                       3                                                3     3

     Remark on writing down the steps When the substitution is complicated, it is a
     good idea to get du=dx where you need it. Here 3x2 C 1 needs 6x:

                ÷                                 ÷                                  ÷
                                               7                                  7 4 du
                      7x.3x2 C 1/4dx D .3x C 1/ 6x dx D u dx2       4

                                               6                                  6           dx

                Now integrate:                 7 u5    CC D    7 .3x2 C 1/5       CC:                         (3)

     Check the derivative at the end. The exponent 5 cancels 5 in the denominator,
     6x from the chain rule cancels 6, and 7x is what we started with.

     Remark on differentials In place of .du=dx/dx, many people just write du:

                                 .3x2 C 1/46x dx D u4du D 15 u5 C C:                                          (4)

     This really shows how substitution works. We switch from x to u, and we also

     switch from dx to du. The most common mistake is to confuse dx with du: The

     factor du=dx from the chain rule is absolutely needed, to reach du: The change of
     variables (dummy variables anyway!) leaves an easy integral, and then u turns back
     into 3x2 C 1: Here are the four steps to substitute u for x:

           1. Choose u.x/ and compute du=dx
           2. Locate v.u/ times du=dx times dx, or v.u/ times du
           3. Integrate v.u/ du to find f .u/ C C
           4. Substitute u.x/ back into this antiderivative f:

     EXAMPLE 12 .cos x/ dx=2 x D cos u du D sin u C C D sin x C C

                                                       (put in u) (integrate) (put back x)

     The choice of u must be right, to change everything from x to u: With ingenuity,
     some remarkable integrals are possible. But most will remain impossible forever.

     The functions cos x2 and 1= 4 ¡ sin2x have no "elementary" antiderivative. Those

     integrals are well defined and they come up in applications--the latter gives the

                      The exercises concentrate on substitutions, which need and deserve practice. We

        5.5 The Definite Integral

     The integral of v.x/ is an antiderivative f .x/ plus a constant C . This section takes
     two steps. First, we choose C . Second, we construct f .x/. The object is to define
     the integral--in the most frequent case when a suitable f .x/ is not directly known.

       The indefinite integral contains "CC ." The constant is not settled because
     f .x/ C C has the same slope for every C . When we care only about the derivative,
     C makes no difference. When the goal is a number--a definite integral--C can be

     assigned a definite value at the starting point.

       For mileage traveled, we subtract the reading at the start. This section does
     the same for area. Distance is f .t / and area is f .x/--while the definite integral

     is f .b/ ¡ f .a/. Don't pay attention to t or x, pay attention to the great formula of

     integral calculus:

     ÷b  ÷b
         v.t/ dt D v.x/ dx D f .b/ ¡ f .a/:
                                                                               (1)

     a   a

     Viewpoint 1 W When f is known, the equation gives the area from a to b.
     Viewpoint 2 W When f is not known, the equation defines f from the area.

     For a typical v.x/, we can't find f .x/ by guessing or substitution. But still v.x/ has
     an "area" under its graph--and this yields the desired integral f .x/.

       Most of this section is theoretical, leading to the definition of the integral. You may
     think we should have defined integrals before computing them--which is logically
     true. But the idea of area (and the use of rectangles) was already pretty clear in our
     first examples. Now we go much further. Every continuous function v.x/ has an
     integral (also some discontinuous functions). Then the Fundamental Theorem com-
     pletes the circle: The integral leads back to df =dx D v.x/. The area up to x is the
     antiderivative that we couldn't otherwise discover.

        THE CONSTANT OF INTEGRATION

     Our goal is to turn f .x/ C C into a definite integral-- the area between a and b. The
     first requirement is to have area D zero at the start:

     f .a/ C C D starting area D 0 so C D ¡f .a/:                              (2)

     For the area up to x (moving endpoint, indefinite integral), use t as the dummy
     variable:

     the area from a to x is ax v.t/ dtD f .x/ ¡ f .a/  (indefinite integral)
     the area from a to b is ab v.x/ dxD f .b/ ¡ f .a/  (definite integral)

     EXAMPLE 1 The area under the graph of 5.x C 1/4 from a to b has
     f .x/ D .x C 1/5:

                ab 5.x C 1/4dx D .x C 1/5 D .b C 1/ ib 5 ¡ .a C 1/5:
                                                                               a

     The calculation has two separate steps--first find f .x/, then substitute b and a. After
     the first step, check that df =dx is v. The upper limit in the second step gives plus
                                     5.5 The Definite Integral                                           255

f .b/, the lower limit gives minus f .a/. Notice the brackets (or the vertical bar):

      f .x/ a b D f .b/ ¡ f .a/ x3j12 D 8 ¡ 1 cos x 0 2t D cos 2t ¡ 1:
Changing the example to f .x/ D .x C 1/5 ¡ 1 gives an equally good antiderivative--
and now f .0/ D 0. But f .b/ ¡ f .a/ stays the same, because the ¡1 disappears:

     .x C 1/ h 5 ¡ 1 D ..b C 1/ ib 5 ¡ 1/ ¡ ..a C 1/5 ¡ 1/ D .b C 1/5 ¡ .a C 1/5:
                              a

EXAMPLE 2 When v D 2x sin x2 we recognize f D ¡ cos x2. The area from

0 to 3 is                 3 2x sin x2 dx D ¡ cosx2 D i3 ¡ cos 9 C cos 0:

                         0                                   0

The upper limit copies the minus sign. The lower limit gives ¡.¡ cos 0/, which is

C cos 0. That example shows the right form for solving exercises on definite

integrals.

 Example 2 jumped directly to f .x/ D ¡ cos x2. But most problems involving the

chain rule go more slowly--by substitution. Set u D x2, with du=dx D 2x:

                  2x sin x2 ÷ 3 ÷ 3 dx D sin u du ÷ < dx D sin u du: (3)
                                                             dx
                      0                         0                     <

We need new limits when u replaces x2. Those limits on u are a2 and b2. (In this

case a2 D 02 and b2 D 32 D 9.) If x goes from a to b, then u goes from u.a/ to

u.b/.       ÷ b v.u.x// du ÷ u.b/ dx D v.u/ du D f .u.b// ¡ f .u.a//: (4)

                  ÷1                                  ÷ 6 3 du u4 #6 64 54
                                                                                D ¡.
EXAMPLE 3                   .x C 5/ x dx D u D23

                      xD0 uD5 2 8 5 8 8

In this case u D x2 C 5. Therefore du=dx D 2x (or du D 2x dx for differentials).
We have to account for the missing 2. The integral is 18 u4. The limits on u D x2 C 5
are u.0/ D 02 C 5 and u.1/ D 12 C 5. That is why the u-integral goes from 5 to 6.
                                             1
The  alternative  is  to    find  f  .x/  D  8  .x2  C  5/4  in  one  jump  (and  check  it).

                      0

If we try cos x2, the chain rule produces an extra 2x--no adjustment will work. Does
sin x2 still have an antiderivative? Yes! Every continuous v.x/ has an f .x/. Whether

f .x/ has an algebraic formula or not, we can write it as v.x/dx. To define that

integral, we now take the limit of rectangular areas.

                      INTEGRALS AS LIMITS OF "RIEMANN SUMS"

We have come to the definition of the integral. The chapter started with the

integrals of x and x2, from formulas for 1 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C n and 12 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C n2. We will not

go back to those formulas. But for other functions, too irregular to find exact sums,
the rectangular areas also approach a limit.

  That limit is the integral. This definition is a major step in the theory of calculus.
It can be studied in detail, or understood in principle. The truth is that the definition
is not so painful--you virtually know it already.
256                                            5 Integrals

         Problem Integrate the continuous function v.x/ over the interval OEa; b.

        Step 1 Split OEa; b into n subintervals OEa; x1; OEx1; x2; : : : ; OExn¡1; b.

     The "meshpoints" x1; x2; : : : divide up the interval from a to b. The endpoints are

     x0 D a and xn D b. The length of subinterval k is xk D xk ¡ xk¡1. In that smaller

     interval, the minimum of v.x/ is mk. The maximum is Mk.
       Now construct rectangles. The "lower rectangle" over interval k has height mk.

     The "upper rectangle" reaches to Mk. Since v is continuous, there are points xmin
     and xmax where v D mk and v D Mk (extreme value theorem). The graph of v.x/
     is in between.

       Important: The area under v.x/ contains the area "s" of the lower rectangles:

               ab v.x/ dx m1  x1 C m2  x2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C mn  xn D s: (5)

     The area under v.x/ is contained in the area "S " of the upper rectangles:

              ab v.x/ dx M1  x1 C M2  x2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C Mn  xn D S: (6)

     The lower sum s and the upper sum S were computed earlier in special cases--
     when v was x or x2 and the spacings x were equal. Figure 5.9a shows why s
     area S .

     Fig. 5.9  Area of lower rectangles D s: Upper sum S includes top pieces. Riemann sum S¦

               is in between.

     Notice an important fact. When a new dividing point x½ is added, the lower sum

     increases. The minimum in one piece can be greater (see second figure) than the

     original mk. Similarly the upper sum decreases. The maximum in one piece can be
     below the overall maximum. As new points are added, s goes up and S comes

     down. So the sums come closer together:

               s s½                           S½ S:  (7)

     I have left space in between for the curved area--the integral of v.x/.
       Now add more and more meshpoints in such a way that xmax 0. The lower

     sums increase and the upper sums decrease. They never pass each other. If v.x/ is
     continuous, those sums close in on a single number A. That number is the definite
     integral--the area under the graph.

     DEFINITION The area A is the common limit of the lower and upper sums:

                                 REMARKS ON THE INTEGRAL

As for derivatives, so for integrals: The definition involves a limit. Calculus is built
on limits, and we always add "if the limit exists." That is the delicate point. I hope the
next five remarks (increasingly technical) will help to distinguish functions that are
Riemann integrable from functions that are not.

Remark 1 The sums s and S may fail to approach the same limit. A standard
example has V .x/ D 1 at all fractions x D p=q, and V .x/ D 0 at all other points.

Every interval contains rational points (fractions) and irrational points (nonrepeating
decimals). Therefore mk D 0 and Mk D 1. The lower sum is always s D 0. The upper

sum is always S D b ¡ a (the sum of 1's times x's). The gap in equation (7) stays

open. This function V .x/ is not Riemann integrable. The area under its graph is not
defined (at least by Riemann--see Remark 5).

Remark 2 The step function U.x/ is discontinuous but still integrable. On every

interval the minimum mk equals the maximum Mk--except on the interval contain-
ing the jump. That jump interval has mk D 0 and Mk D 1. But when we multiply by
xk, and require xmax 0, the difference between s and S goes to zero. The area
under a step function is clear--the rectangles fit exactly.

Remark 3 With patience another key step could be proved: If s A and S A

for one sequence of meshpoints, then this limit A is approached by every choice

of meshpoints with xmax 0. The integral is the lower bound of all upper sums

S , and it is the upper bound of all possible s--provided those bounds are equal. The

gap must close, to define the integral.
The same limit A is approached by "in-between rectangles." The height v.xk¦/ can
                               x¦                         k.
be  computed   at  any  point       in  subinterval           See  Figures  5.9c  and   5.10.   Then     the
                                 k
total rectangular area is a "Riemann sum" between s and S :

               S ¦ D v .x1¦/  x1 C v.x2¦/  x2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C v.xn¦/  xn:                                      (9)

We cannot tell whether the true area is above or below S ¦. Very often A is closer to S ¦
than to s or S . The midpoint rule takes x¦ in the middle of its interval (Figure 5.10),

and Section 5.8 will establish its extra accuracy. The extreme sums s and S are used

in the definition while S ¦ is used in computation.

                                              k

Remark 4 Every continuous function is Riemann integrable. The proof is op-

tional (in my class), but it belongs here for reference. It starts with continuity at x¦:

"For any " there is a i . . . ." When the rectangles sit between x¦ ¡ i and x¦ C i,

the bounds Mk and mk differ by less than 2". Multiplying by the base xk, the ar-

eas differ by less than 2".xk/. Combining all rectangles, the upper and lower sums

differ by less than 2".x1 C x2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C xn/ D 2".b ¡ a/.

       As " 0 we conclude that S comes arbitrarily close to s. They squeeze in on a
     single number A. The Riemann sums approach the Riemann integral, if v is continu-
     ous.

       Two problems are hidden by that reasoning. One is at the end, where S and s come
     together. We have to know that the line of real numbers has no "holes," so there is a
     number A to which these sequences converge. That is true.

           Any increasing sequence, if it is bounded above, approaches a limit.

     The decreasing sequence S , bounded below, converges to the same limit. So A exists.
       The other problem is about continuity. We assumed without saying so that the width

     2i is the same around every point x¦. We did not allow for the possibility that i might

     approach zero where v.x/ is rapidly changing--in which case an infinite number of
     rectangles could be needed. Our reasoning requires that

       v.x/ is uniformly continuous: i depends on " but not on the position of x¦.

     For each " there is a i that works at all points in the interval. A continuous function
     on a closed interval is uniformly continuous. This fact (proof omitted) makes the
     reasoning correct, and v.x/ is integrable.

       On an infinite interval, even v D x2 is not uniformly continuous. It changes across a

     subinterval by .x¦ C i/2 ¡ .x¦ ¡ i/2 D 4x¦i. As x¦ gets larger, i must get smaller--

     to keep 4x¦i below ". No single i succeeds at all x¦. But on a finite interval OE0; b,

     the choice i D "=4b works everywhere--so v D x2 is uniformly continuous.

     Remark 5 If those four remarks were fairly optional, this one is totally at your

     discretion. Modern mathematics needs to integrate the zero-one function V .x/ in the

     first remark. Somehow V has more 0's than 1's. The fractions (where V .x/ D 1) can

     be put in a list, but the irrational numbers (where V .x/ D 0) are "uncountable." The

     integral ought to be zero, but Riemann's upper sums all involve Mk D 1.

        Lebesgue discovered a major improvement. He allowed infinitely many subinter-

     vals (smaller and smaller). Then all fractions can be covered with intervals of total

     width ": (Amazing, when the fractions are packed so densely.) The idea is to cover
     1=q; 2=q; : : :; q=q by narrow intervals of total width "=2q. Combining all

     q D 1; 2; 3; : : :; the total width to cover all fractions is no more than¤¤¤
                          
     "  1  C  1  C  1  C           D ". Since V .x/ D 0 everywhere else, the upper sum S is only
        2     4     8
     ". And since " was arbitrary, the "Lebesgue integral" is zero as desired.

       That completes a fair amount of theory, possibly more than you want or need--
     but it is satisfying to get things straight. The definition of the integral is still being
     studied by experts (and so is the derivative, again to allow more functions). By
     contrast, the properties of the integral are used by everybody. Therefore the next
     section turns from definition to properties, collecting the rules that are needed in
     applications. They are very straightforward.

     5.6 Properties of the Integral and Average Value

                                                                                  b

     The previous section reached the definition of av.x/ dx: But the subject cannot stop
     there. The integral was defined in order to be used. Its properties are important, and
     its applications are even more important. The definition was chosen so that the
     integral has properties that make the applications possible.

       One direct application is to the average value of v.x/: The average of n numbers
     is clear, and the integral extends that idea--it produces the average of a whole
     continuum of numbers v.x/: This develops from the last rule in the following list
     (Property 7). We now collect together seven basic properties of definite integrals.

       The addition rule for OEv.x/ C w.x/ dx will not be repeated--even though this
     property of linearity is the most fundamental. We start instead with a different kind of
     addition. There is only one function v.x/, but now there are two intervals.

       The integral from a to b is added to its neighbor from b to c: Their sum is the
     integral from a to c. That is the first (not surprising) property in the list.

     Property 1  Areas over neighboring intervals add to the area over the combined
     interval:

                       b            c               c
                       a v.x/ dx C b v.x/ dx D a v.x/ dx:                       (1)

     This sum of areas is graphically obvious (Figure 5.11a). It also comes from the formal
     definition of the integral. Rectangular areas obey (1)--with a meshpoint at x D b to
     make sure. When xmax approaches zero, their limits also obey (1). All the normal
     rules for rectangular areas are obeyed in the limit by integrals.

       Property 1 is worth pursuing. It indicates how to define the integral when a D b:
     The integral "from b to b" is the area over a point, which we expect to be zero. It is.

     Property 2                     b

                                    b v.x/ dx D 0:

     That comes from Property 1 when c D b: Equation (1) has two identical integrals, so
     the one from b to b must be zero. Next we see what happens if c D a--which makes
     the second integral go from b to a:

       What happens when an integral goes backward? The "lower limit" is now the
     larger number b: The "upper limit" a is smaller. Going backward reverses the sign:

     Property 3           ba v.x/ dx D ¡ ab v.x/ dx D f .a/ ¡ f .b/:

     Proof When c D a the right side of (1) is zero. Then the integrals on the left side
     must cancel, which is Property 3. In going from b to a the steps x are negative.

     That justifies a minus sign on the rectangular areas, and a minus sign on the integral

     (Figure 5.11b). Conclusion: Property 1 holds for any ordering of a; b; c:

     Property 4 For odd functions ¡a v.x/ dx D 0: "Odd" means that v.¡x/ D ¡v.x/:
     For even functions ¡a v.x/ dx D 2 0 v.x/ dx: "Even" means that v.¡x/ D Cv.x/:aa

     The functions x; x3; x5; : : : are odd. If x changes sign, these powers change sign.
     The functions sin x and tan x are also odd, together with their inverses. This is an

important family of functions, and the integral of an odd function from ¡a to a

equals zero. Areas cancel:

¡a 6x dx D x ¡a D a ¡ .¡a/ D 0:a56a6         6

If v.x/ is odd then f .x/ is even! All powers 1; x2; x4; : : : are even functions. Curi-
ous fact: Odd function times even function is odd, but odd number times even number
is even. a

 For even functions, areas add: ¡a cos x dx D sin a ¡ sin .¡a/ D 2 sin a:

Fig. 5.11 Properties 1-4: Add areas, change sign to go backward, odd cancels, even adds.

  The next properties involve inequalities. If v.x/ is positive, the area under its graph
is positive (not surprising). Now we have a proof: The lower sums s are positive and
they increase toward the area integral. So the integral is positive:

                                                                              b

Property 5 If v.x/ 0 for a x b then a v.x/ dx 0:
A positive velocity means a positive distance. A positive v lies above a positive area.
A more general statement is true. Suppose v.x/ stays between a lower function l.x/
and an upper function u.x/: Then the rectangles for v stay between the rectangles for
l and u: In the limit, the area under v (Figure 5.12) is between the areas under l and u:

EXAMPLE 3 Integrating 1 C x2 1 1 leads to tan¡1x x:

All those examples are for x 0: You may remember that Section 2.4 used
geometry to prove sin h h tan h: Examples 1-2 seem to give new and shorter
proofs. But I think the reasoning is doubtful. The inequalities were needed to
compute the derivatives (therefore the integrals) in the first place.

262                                              5 Integrals

     Property 7 (Mean Value Theorem for Integrals) If v.x/ is continuous, there
     is a point c between a and b where v.c/ equals the average value of v.x/:

                            1 ÷b

                 v.c/ D b ¡ a a v.x/ dx D "average value of v.x/:" (3)

     This is the same as the ordinary Mean Value Theorem (for the derivative of f .x/):

                        f ½.c/ D f .b/ ¡ f .c/ D "average slope of f: " (4)
                                 b¡a

     With f ½ D v; (3) and (4) are the same equation. But honesty makes me admit to a

     flaw in the logic. We need the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to guarantee that½
              x
     f .x/ D  a  v.t /  dt  really  gives  f     D   v:

     A direct proof of (3) places one rectangle across the interval from a to b: Now raise

     the top of that rectangle, starting at vmin (the bottom of the curve) and moving up to

     vmax (the top of the curve). At some height the area will be just right--equal to the

     area under the curve. Then the rectangular area, which is .b ¡ a/ times v.c/, equals
                                 b

     the curved area a v.x/ dx: This is equation (3).

     Fig. 5.13 Mean Value Theorem for integrals: area=.b ¡ a/ D average height D v.c/ at some c:

       That direct proof uses the intermediate value theorem: A continuous function
     v.x/ takes on every height between vmin and vmax: At some point (at two points in
     Figure 5.12c) the function v.x/ equals its own average value.

       Figure 5.13 shows equal areas above and below the average height v.c/ D
     vave.

     EXAMPLE 4 The average value of an odd function is zero (between ¡1 and 1):

                 1÷1                 # x2 1 1 1                                   note 1 D 1

                                              ¡1

     For once we know c: It is the center point x D 0; where v.c/ D vave D 0:

     EXAMPLE 5   The        average  value       of  x2  is  1  (between  1  and  ¡1):

     Where does this function x2 equal its average value 31 ? That happens when c2 D 31 ,

     so c can be either of the points 1= 3 and ¡1= 3 in Figure 5.13b. Those are the

     Gauss points, which are terrific for numerical integration as Section 5.8 will show.

                      THE AVERAGE VALUE AND EXPECTED VALUE

 The "average value" from a to b is the integral divided by the length b ¡ a: This

was computed for x and x2 and sin2x, but not explained. It is a major application of
the integral, and it is guided by the ordinary average of n numbers:

               1 ÷b                          comes from                     vave D 1 .v1 C v2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C vn/:

Integration is parallel to summation! Sums approach integrals. Discrete averages
                                                                   31 ;  32 ;  3       32 :                     51 ;  52 ;  53 ;  54 ;  5

The middle term gives the average, when n is odd. Or we can do the addition. As

n        the sum approaches an integral (do you see the rectangles?). The ordinary

average of numbers becomes the continuous average of v.x/ D x:

                         PREDICTABLE AVERAGES FROM RANDOM EVENTS

        Suppose you throw a pair of dice. The outcome is not predictable. Otherwise why
        throw them? But the average over more and more throws is totally predictable.
        We don't know what will happen, but we know its probability.

          For dice, we are adding two numbers between 1 and 6: The outcome is between 2
        and 12: The probability of 2 is the chance of two ones: .1=6/.1=6/ D 1=36: Beside
        each outcome we can write its probability:

        1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1
     2      3         4           5            6            7   8                     9         10         11      12
        36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36                                                                      36        36       36

        To repeat, one roll is unpredictable. Only the probabilities are known, and they add
        to 1: (Those fractions add to 36=36; all possibilities are covered.) The total from a
        million rolls is even more unpredictable--it can be anywhere between 2; 000; 000 and
        12; 000; 000: Nevertheless the average of those million outcomes is almost com-
        pletely predictable. This expected value is found by adding the products in that line
        above:

        Expected value: multiply (outcome) times (probability of outcome) and add:

               2 C 6 C 12 C 20 C 30 C 42 C 40 C 36 C 30 C 22 C 12 D 7:
               36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36

        If you throw the dice 1000 times, and the average is not between 6:9 and 7:1, you get
        an A. Use the random number generator on a computer and round off to integers.

          Now comes continuous probability. Suppose all numbers between 2 and 12 are
        equally probable. This means all numbers--not just integers. What is the probability
        of hitting the particular number x D ? It is zero! By any reasonable measure,  has
        no chance to occur. In the continuous case, every x has probability zero. But an
        interval of x's has a nonzero probability:

                  the probability of an outcome between 2 and 3 is 1=10
                  the probability of an outcome between x and x C x is x=10

        To find the average, add up each outcome times the probability of that outcome.

        First divide 2 to 12 into intervals of length x D 1 and probability p D 1=10: If
                                                  1
        we  round   off  x,  the  average  is  6  2  :

                                   2 1   C 3 1   C ¤ ¤ ¤C 11 1  D 6:5:
                                     10                 10                   10

        Here all outcomes are integers (as with dice). It is more accurate to use 20 intervals
                                                                                3
        of  length  1=2  and  probability      1=20:       The  average  is  6  4  ,  and  you  see  what  is  coming.

        These are rectangular areas (Riemann sums). As x 0 they approach an integral.

        The probability of an outcome between x and x C dx is p.x/ dx, and this problem

        has p.x/ D 1=10: The average outcome in the continuous case is not a sum but

        an integral:

                                                     ÷ 12                    ÷ 12 dx x2 12

               expected value E.x/ D xp.x/ dx D x D                                                  D 7:
                                                                             2 10 20 2
                                                        2

        That is a big jump. From the point of view of integration, it is a limit of sums. From the
        point of view of probability, the chance of each outcome is zero but the probability

density at x is p.x/ D 1=10: The integral of p.x/ is 1, because some outcome must
happen. The integral of xp.x/ is xave D 7, the expected value. Each choice of x is
random, but the average is predictable.

  This completes a first step in probability theory. The second step comes after more

calculus. Decaying probabilities use e¡x and e¡x2 --then the chance of a large x is

very small. Here we end with the expected values of xn and 1= x and 1=x, for a
random choice between 0 and 1 (so p.x/ D 1):

E.xn/ D xn ÷ 1 dx D 1                1  ÷ 1 dx                                          1  ÷ 1 dx            D .S/

                        0

                           A CONFUSION ABOUT "EXPECTED" CLASS SIZE

A college can advertise an average class size of 29; while most students are in large
classes most of the time. I will show quickly how that happens.

  Suppose there are 95 classes of 20 students and 5 classes of 200 students. The total
enrollment in 100 classes is 1900 C 1000 D 2900: A random professor has expected
class size 29: But a random student sees it differently. The probability is 1900=2900
of being in a small class and 1000=2900 of being in a large class. Adding class size
times probability gives the expected class size for the student:

                            .20/ 1900  C .200/ 1000 D 82 students in the class.
                           2900     2900

  Similarly, the average waiting time at a restaurant seems like 40 minutes (to the
customer). To the hostess, who averages over the whole day, it is 10 minutes. If you
came at a random time it would be 10, but if you are a random customer it is 40:

  Traffic problems could be eliminated by raising the average number of people per
car to 2:5, or even 2: But that is virtually impossible. Part of the problem is the
difference between (a) the percentage of cars with one person and (b) the percentage
of people alone in a car. Percentage (b) is smaller. In practice, most people would be

in crowded cars. See Problems 37 ¡ 38:

  5.7 The Fundamental Theorem and Its Applications

When the endpoints are fixed at a and b, we have a definite integral. When the upper
limit is a variable point x, we have an indefinite integral. More generally: When the
endpoints depend in any way on x, the integral is a function of x: Therefore we
can find its derivative. This requires the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

  The essence of the Theorem is: Derivative of integral of v equals v. We also
compute the derivative when the integral goes from a.x/ to b.x/--both limits vari-
able.

  Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem reverses the order: Integral of derivative of f
equals f C C . That will follow quickly from Part 1, with help from the Mean Value
Theorem. It is Part 2 that we use most, since integrals are harder than derivatives.

  After the proofs we go to new applications, beyond the standard problem of area
under a curve. Integrals can add up rings and triangles and shells--not just rectangles.
The answer can be a volume or a probability--not just an area.

                           THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM, PART 1

Start with a continuous function v: Integrate it from a fixed point a to a variable
point x: For each x, this integral f .x/ is a number. We do not require or expect a
formula for f .x/--it is the area out to the point x: It is a function of x! The
Fundamental Theorem says that this area function has a derivative (another limiting
process). The derivative df =dx equals the original v.x/:

5C (Fundamental Theorem, Part 1) Suppose v.x/ is a continuous function:

                                                 x

                  If f .x/ D a v.t / dt then df =dx D v.x/:

The dummy variable is written as t , so we can concentrate on the limits. The value of
the integral depends on the limits a and x, not on t:

 To find df =dx, start with f D f .x C x/ ¡ f .x/ D difference of areas:

          f D axCx v.t / dt ¡ ax v.t / dt D xxCx v.t / dt: (1)

Officially, this is Property 1: The area out to x C x minus the area out to x equals
the small part from x to x C x: Now divide by x:

f 1 ÷ xCx  v.t/ dt D average value D v.c/:
D                                                                        (2)
x x x

This is Property 7, the Mean Value Theorem for integrals. The average value on this
short interval equals v.c/: This point c is somewhere between x and x C x (exact
position not known), and we let x approach zero. That squeezes c toward x, so
v.c/ approaches u.x/--remember that v is continuous. The limit of equation (2) is

the Fundamental Theorem:

f df and v.c/ v.x/ so df D v.x/: (3)
x dx       dx

If x is negative the reasoning still holds. Why assume that v.x/ is continuous?
Because if v is a step function, then f .x/ has a corner where df =dx is not v.x/:
268                 5 Integrals

     We could skip the Mean Value Theorem and simply bound v above and below:

     for t between x and x C x W     vmin v.t / vmax

     integrate over that interval: vminx f vmaxx                                      (4)

     divide by x W                   vmin f =x vmax

     As x 0, vmin and vmax approach v.x/: In the limit df =dx again equals v.x/:

     Fig. 5.14 Fundamental Theorem, Part 1: (thin area f )=(base length x) height v.x/:

     Graphical meaning The f-graph gives the area under the v-graph. The thin strip in
     Figure 5.14 has area f: That area is approximately v.x/ times x. Dividing by
     its base, f =x is close to the height v.x/: When x 0 and the strip becomes
     infinitely thin, the expression "close to" converges to "equals." Then df =dx is the
     height at v.x/:

     DERIVATIVES WITH VARIABLE ENDPOINTS

     When the upper limit is x, the derivative is v.x/: Suppose the lower limit is x: The
     integral goes from x to b, instead of a to x: When x moves, the lower limit moves.
     The change in area is on the left side of Figure 5.15. As x goes forward, area is
     removed. So there is a minus sign in the derivative of area:

     ÷ b The derivative of g.x/ D v.t/ dt is dg D ¡v.x/: (5)
                                         dx
                                  x

     The quickest proof is to reverse b and x, which reverses the sign (Property 3):

                      ÷x   so by Part 1  dg D ¡v.x/:

     g.x/ D ¡ v.t/ dt                    dx
                        b

     Fig. 5.15 Area from x to b has dg=dx D ¡v.x/: Area v.b/db is added, area v.a/da is lost

       The general case is messier but not much harder (it is quite useful). Suppose both
     limits are changing. The upper limit b.x/ is not necessarily x, but it depends on x:
    5.7 The Fundamental Theorem and Its Applications                                    269

The lower limit a.x/ can also depend on x (Figure 5.15b). The area A between those
limits changes as x changes, and we want dA=dx:

÷ b.x/ If A D v.t / dt then dA D v.b.x// db ¡ v.a.x// da : (6)
           a.x/               dx                  dx                   dx

The figure shows two thin strips, one added to the area and one subtracted.
  First check the two cases we know. When a D 0 and b D x, we have da=dx D 0

and db=dx D 1: The derivative according to (6) is v.x/ times 1--the Fundamental
Theorem. The other case has a D x and b D constant. Then the lower limit in (6)

produces ¡v.x/: When the integral goes from a D 2x to b D x3, its derivative is

new:

EXAMPLE 1      A D 2x x cos t dt 3 D sin x3 ¡ sin 2x
           dA=dx D .cos x3/.3x2/ ¡ .cos 2x/.2/:

That fits with (6), because db=dx is 3x2 and da=dx is 2 (with minus sign). It also

looks like the chain rule--which it is! To prove (6) we use the letters v and f :

           ÷ b.x/  v.t/ dt D f .b.x// ¡ f .a.x//

AD                                                (by Part 2 below)

           a.x/

dA D f ½.b.x// db ¡ f ½.a.x// da                  (by the chain rule)
dx                 dx         dx

Since f ½ D v, equation (6) is proved. In the next example the area turns out to be

constant, although it seems to depend on x: Note that v.t / D 1=t so v.3x/ D 1=3x:

÷ 3x EXAMPLE 2 A D 1 dt has dA  D 1   .3/ ¡ 1  .2/ D 0:
                   2x t  dx 3x                    2x

÷ x Question A D v.t/ dt has dA D v.x/ C v.¡x/: Why does v.¡x/ have a plus sign?
           ¡x            dx

                   THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM, PART 2

We have used a hundred times the Theorem that is now to be proved. It is the key to
integration. "The integral of df =dx is f .x/ C C ." The application starts with v.x/:
We search for an f .x/ with this derivative. If df =dx D v.x/, the Theorem says that

                   ÷ ÷ df
                   v.x/ dx D      dx D f .x/ C C:
                              dx

We can't rely on knowing formulas for v and f --only the definitions of and d=dx:

The proof rests on one extremely special case: df =dx is the zero function.

We easily find f .x/ D constant. The problem is to prove that there are no other

possibilities: f must be constant. When the slope is zero, the graph must be flat.

Everybody knows this is true, but intuition is not the same as proof.

Assume that df =dx D 0 in an interval. If f .x/ is not constant, there are points

where f .a/ ¤ f .b/: By the Mean Value Theorem, there is a point c where

f ½.c/ D f .b/ ¡ f .a/   .this is not zero becausef .a/ ¤ f .b//:
         b¡a

But f ½.c/ ¤ 0 directly contradicts df =dx D 0: Therefore f .x/ must be constant.
270                                                                    5 Integrals

       Note the crucial role of the Mean Value Theorem. A local hypothesis (df =dx D 0
     at each point) yields a global conclusion (f D constant in the whole interval). The
     derivative narrows the field of view, the integral widens it. The Mean Value Theorem
     connects instantaneous to average, local to global, points to intervals. This special
     case (the zero function) applies when A.x/ and f .x/ have the same derivative:

              If dA=dx D df =dx on an interval; then A.x/ D f .x/ C C:                                              (7)

     Reason: The derivative of A.x/ ¡ f .x/ is zero. So A.x/ ¡ f .x/ must be constant.

       Now comes the big theorem. It assumes that v.x/ is continuous, and integrates

     using f .x/:

     5D (Fundamental Theorem, Part 2) If v.x/ D df ÷ b then v.x/ dx Df .b/ ¡ f .a/:
                                                                                      dx
                                                                                          a

     Proof The antiderivative is f .x/: But Part 1 gave another antiderivative for the same
     v.x/: It was the integral--constructed from rectangles and now called A.x/:

                                                 ÷x                             also has  dA D v.x/:
                                                                                          dx
                                   A.x/ D v.t/ dt

                                                   a

     Since A½ D v and f ½ D v, the special case in equation (7) states that A.x/ D f .x/ C

     C: That is the essential point: The integral from rectangles equals f .x/ C C .

       At the lower limit the area integral is A D 0: So f .a/ C C D 0: At the upper limit
     f .b/ C C D A.b/: Subtract to find A.b/, the definite integral:

                                            A.b/ D ab v.x/ dx D f .b/ ¡ f .a/:

     Calculus is beautiful--its Fundamental Theorem is also its most useful theorem.

       Another proof of Part 2 starts with f ½ D v and looks at subintervals:

        f     .  x  1  /  ¡  f     .  a  /  D  v  .  x  ¦  /  .  x  1  ¡  a  /        (by the Mean Value Theorem)

     The left sides add to f .b/ ¡ f .a/: The sum on the right, as x 0, is ab v.x/ dx:

                                    APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION

     Up to now the integral has been the area under a curve. There are many other
     applications, quite different from areas. Whenever addition becomes "continuous,"
     we have integrals instead of sums. Chapter 8 has space to develop more applica-
     tions, but four examples can be given immediately--which will make the point.

       We stay with geometric problems, rather than launching into physics or
     engineering or biology or economics. All those will come. The goal here is to take
     a first step away from rectangles.
             5.7 The Fundamental Theorem and Its Applications                             271

EXAMPLE 3 (for circles) The area A and circumference C are related by
dA=dr D C .
The question is why. The area is  r2: Its derivative 2 r is the circumference. By
the Fundamental Theorem, the integral of C is A: What is missing is the geometrical
reason. Certainly  r2 is the integral of 2 r, but what is the real explanation for
A D C.r/dr?

  My point is that the pieces are not rectangles. We could squeeze rectangles under
a circular curve, but their heights would have nothing to do with C: Our intuition has
to take a completely different direction, and add up the thin rings in Figure 5.16.

Fig. 5.16 Area of circle D integral over rings. Volume of sphere D integral over shells.

  Suppose the ring thickness is r: Then the ring area is close to C times r: This

is precisely the kind of approximation we need, because its error is of higher order
.r/2: The integral adds ring areas just as it added rectangular areas:

÷r    ÷r

A D C dr D 2r dr D r2:

   0     0

That is our first step toward freedom, away from rectangles to rings.
  The ring area A can be checked exactly--it is the difference of circles:

            A D .r C r/2 ¡ r2 D 2r r C .r/2:

This is Cr plus a correction. Dividing both sides by r 0 leaves dA=dr D C:
  Finally there is a geometrical reason. The ring unwinds into a thin strip. Its width

is r and its length is close to C: The inside and outside circles have different
perimeters, so this is not a true rectangle--but the area is near Cr:

EXAMPLE 4 For a sphere, surface area and volume satisfy A D d V =dr:

What worked for circles will work for spheres. The thin rings become thin shells. A

shell goes from radius r to radius r C r, so its thickness is r: We want the volume
of the shell, but we don't need it exactly. The surface area is 4 r2, so the volume is
about 4 r2 r: That is close enough!

  Again we are correct except for .r/2: Infinitesimally speaking d V D A dr:

V D A d r D 4 r2 ÷ r ÷ r d r D 4  r3:
            3
0     0

This is the volume of a sphere. The derivative of V is A, and the shells explain why.
Main point: Integration is not restricted to rectangles.

                 EXAMPLE 5 The distance around a square is 4s: Why does the area have
                 dA=ds D 2s?
                 The side is s and the area is s2: Its derivative 2s goes only half way around the
                 square. I tried to understand that by drawing a figure. Normally this works, but in the
                 figure dA=ds looks like 4s: Something is wrong. The bell is ringing so I leave this as
                 an exercise.

                 EXAMPLE 6 Find the area under v.x/ D cos¡1x from x D 0 to x D 1:
                 That is a conventional problem, but we have no antiderivative for cos¡1x: We could

                 look harder, and find one. However there is another solution--unconventional but cor-
                 rect. The region can be filled with horizontal rectangles (not vertical rectangles).

                 Figure 5.17b shows a typical strip of length x D cos v (the curve has v D cos¡1x). As

                 the thickness v approaches zero, the total area becomes x dv: We are integrating
                 upward, so the limits are on v not on x:

                    5.8 Numerical Integration

This section concentrates on definite integrals. The inputs are y.x/ and two endpoints
a and b: The output is the integral I: Our goal is to find that number

  b

 ay.x/ dx D I , accurately and in a short time. Normally this goal is achievable--as
soon as we have a good method for computing integrals.

  Our two approaches so far have weaknesses. The search for an antiderivative
succeeds in important cases, and Chapter 7 extends that range--but generally f .x/
is not available. The other approach (by rectangles) is in the right direction but too
crude. The height is set by y.x/ at the right and left end of each small interval. The
right and left rectangle rules add the areas (x times y):

 Rn D .x/.y1 C y2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C yn/ and Ln D .x/.y0 C y1 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C yn¡1/:

The value of y.x/ at the end of interval j is yj : The extreme left value y0 D y.a/

enters Ln: With n equal intervals of length x D .b ¡ a/=n, the extreme right value

is yn D y.b/: It enters Rn: Otherwise the sums are the same--simple to compute,
easy to visualize, but very inaccurate.

  This section goes from slow methods (rectangles) to better methods (trapezoidal
and midpoint) to good methods (Simpson and Gauss). Each improvement cuts down
the error. You could discover the formulas without the book, by integrating x and x2
and x4: The rule Rn would come out on one side of the answer, and Ln would be
on the other side. You would figure out what to do next, to come closer to the exact
integral. The book can emphasize one key point:

             The quality of a formula depends on how many integrals
               1 dx; x dx; x2 dx; : : :; it computes exactly. If xp dx

             is the first to be wrong, the order of accuracy is p:

By testing the integrals of 1; x; x2; : : :, we decide how accurate the formulas are.
  Figure 5.18 shows the rectangle rules Rn and Ln: They are already wrong when

y D x. These methods are first-order: p D 1: The errors involve the first power of
x--where we would much prefer a higher power. A larger p in .x/p means a
smaller error.

       Fig. 5.18 Errors E and e in Rn and Ln are the areas of triangles.

  When the graph of y.x/ is a straight line, the integral I is known. The error

triangles E and e have base x: Their heights are the differences yj C1 ¡ yj : The

areas are 21 (base)(height), and the only difference is a minus sign. (L is too low, so

the error L ¡ I is negative.) The total error in Rn is the sum of the E's:

Rn  ¡  I  D  1  x .y1    ¡  y0/  C  ¤  ¤  ¤  C  1  x .yn    ¡  yn¡1/  D  21 x.yn  ¡  y0/:  (1)
             2                                  2

All y's between y0 and yn cancel. Similarly for the sum of the e's:

          Ln    ¡  I  D  ¡  1  x .yn      ¡  y0/   D  ¡  1  xOEy.b/   ¡  y.a/:             (2)

276                                          5 Integrals

     The greater the slope of y.x/, the greater the error--since rectangles have zero slope.

       Formulas (1) and (2) are nice--but those errors are large. To integrate y D x

     from a D 0 to b D 1; the error is 21 x.1 ¡ 0/: It takes 500; 000 rectangles to reduce

     this error to 1=1; 000; 000. This accuracy is reasonable, but that many rectangles is

     unacceptable.

     The beauty of the error formulas is that they are "asymptotically correct" for all

     functions. When the graph is curved, the errors don't fit exactly into triangles. But

     the ratio of predicted error to actual error approaches 1. As x 0, the graph is

     almost straight in each interval--this is linear approximation.

     The error decreases along each row. So does x D :1; :01; :001; :0001: Multiplying

     n by 10 divides x by 10: The error is also divided by 10 (almost). The error is

     nearly proportional to x--typical of first-order methods.

                                                                                      2
     The     errors  in  Rn     and  Ln  almost  cancel.      The  average  Tn D          .  Rn  C  Ln  /  has

     less error--it is the "trapezoidal rule." First we give the rectangle prediction two final

     tests:

     .x2 ¡ x/ dx W                   errors     nD1             n D 10          n D 100          n D 1000
                                     errors
     dx=.10 C cos 2x/ W                       1:7 ¤ 10¡1       1:7 ¤ 10¡3       1:7 ¤ 10¡5       1:7 ¤ 10¡7
                                             ¡1 ¤10¡3          2 ¤ 10¡14
                                                                                   "0"              "0"

     Those errors are falling faster than x: For y D x2 ¡ x the prediction explains why:

     y.0/ equals y.1/: The leading term, with y.b/ minus y.a/, is zero. The exact errors

     are 16 .x/2, dropping from 10¡1 to 10¡3 to 10¡5 to 10¡7: In these examples Ln is

     identical to Rn (and also to Tn), because the end rectangles are the same. We will see
     these 16 .x/2 errors in the trapezoidal rule.

       The last row in the table is more unusual. It shows practically no error. Why do the

     rectangle rules suddenly achieve such an outstanding success?

       The reason is that y.x/ D 1=.10 C cos 2x/ is periodic. The leading term in the
     error is zero, because y.0/ D y.1/: Also the next term will be zero, because

     y½.0/ D y½.1/: Every power of x is multiplied by zero, when we integrate over

     a complete period. So the errors go to zero exponentially fast.

     Personal note I tried to integrate 1=.10 C cos2x/ by hand and failed. Then I was
     embarrassed to discover the answer in my book on applied mathematics. The method
     was a special trick using complex numbers, which applies over an exact period.
     Finally I found the antiderivative (quite complicated) in a handbook of integrals, and
     verified the area 1= 99:

                            THE TRAPEZOIDAL AND MIDPOINT RULES

    We move to integration formulas that are exact when y D x: They have

second-order accuracy. The x error term disappears. The formulas give the

correct area under straight lines. The predicted error is a multiple of .x/2: That

multiple is found by testing y D x2--for which the answers are not exact.

    The first formula combines Rn and Ln: To cancel as much error as possible, take
                   1
the    average     2  .  Rn  C  Ln  /  :  This   yields     the       trapezoidal          rule,  which      approximates

    y.x/ dx by Tn:

                 Tn      D  1   Rn  C  1  Ln  D  x.      21 y0    C   y1    C  ¤  ¤  ¤  C  yn¡1   C   1  yn/:             (3)
                            2          2                                                              2

Another way to find Tn is from the area of the "trapezoid" below y D x in Figure 5.19a.

          Fig. 5.19 Second-order accuracy: The error prediction is based on v D x2:

The base is x and the sides have heights yj ¡1 and yj : Adding those areas gives
21 .Ln                                                                                            1       1
          C Rn/    in    formula    (3)--the     coefficients         of  yj   combine     into   2   C   2  D  1:  Only  the

first and last intervals are missing a neighbor, so the rule has 21 y0 and 12 yn: Because
trapezoids (unlike rectangles) fit under a sloping line, Tn is exact when y D x:
    What is the difference from rectangles? The trapezoidal rule gives weight 12 x to
y0 and yn: The rectangle rule Rn gives full weight x to yn (and no weight to y0).
Rn ¡ Tn                                               1        ¡      12 y0:
             is  exactly       the  leading   error   2  y  n                 The       change    to  Tn  knocks    out  that

error.

    Another important formula is exact for y.x/ D x: A rectangle has the same area

as a trapezoid, if the height of the rectangle is halfway between yj ¡1 and yj : On a
straight line graph that is achieved at the midpoint of the interval. By evaluating y.x/
                                1         3      5
at  the   halfway  points       2  x;     2  x;  2  x;      :  :  :,  we  get  much     better    rectangles.   This  leads

to the midpoint rule Mn:

                                Mn D x.y1=2 C y3=2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C yn¡1=2/:                                                     (4)

    For   4  x   dx,     trapezoids    give   1  .0/  C  1  C     2   C  3  C  1  .4/   D  8:  The    midpoint  rule  gives
          0                                   2                                2
1      3     5     7                                                                                           x2;
2   C  2  C  2  C  2   D    8,  again  correct.  The     rules        become      different    when      y  D       because

y1=2 is no longer the average of y0 and y1: Try both second-order rules on x2:

          I D 01 x2 dx                           nD                  1                10                  100

                                    error Tn ¡ I D                 1=6             1=600               1=60000
                                    error Mn ¡ I D
                                                                  ¡1=12           ¡1=1200             ¡1=120000

The errors fall by 100 when n is multiplied by 10: The midpoint rule is twice as

good (¡1=12 vs. 1=6). Since all smooth functions are close to parabolas (quadratic
278                                           5 Integrals

     approximation in each interval), the leading errors come from Figure 5.19. The
     trapezoidal error is exactly 16 .x/2 when y.x/ is x2 (the 12 in the formula divides

     the 2 in y½):

                     1      2 ½ ½                              ½ ½  1 2 ½ ½

                        24                            24
     For exact error formulas, change y½.b/ ¡ y½.a/ to .b ¡ a/y¾.c/: The location of

     c is unknown (as in the Mean Value Theorem). In practice these formulas are not

     much used--they involve the pth derivative at an unknown location c: The main

     point about the error is the factor .x/p:

     One crucial fact is easy to overlook in our tests. Each value of y.x/ can be ex-

     tremely hard to compute. Every time a formula asks for yj , a computer calls a sub-

     routine. The goal of numerical integration is to get below the error tolerance, while

     calling for a minimum number of values of y. Second-order rules need about a thou-

     sand values for a typical tolerance of 10¡6: The next methods are better.

                                    FOURTH-ORDER RULE: SIMPSON

     The trapezoidal error is nearly twice the midpoint error (1=6 vs. ¡1=12). So a good

     combination will have twice as much of Mn as Tn: That is Simpson's rule:

     Sn D 13 Tn C 23 Mn D 16 x y0 C 4y1=2 C 2y1 C 4y3=2 C 2y2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C 4yn¡1=2 C yn :

                                                                                                          (7)

     Multiply the midpoint values by 2=3 D 4=6: The endpoint values are multiplied by

     2=6; except at the far ends a and b (with heights y0 and yn). This 1 ¡ 4 ¡ 2 ¡ 4 ¡
     2 ¡ 4 ¡ 1 pattern has become famous.

       Simpson's rule goes deeper than a combination of T and M: It comes from a

     parabolic approximation to y.x/ in each interval. When a parabola goes through y0;
                                           1
     y1=2; y1,  the  area   under  it  is  6    x  .  y  0  C  4y  1  =  2  C  y  1  /  .  This  is  S  over  the  first

     interval. All our rules are constructed this way: Integrate correctly as many

     powers 1; x; x2; : : : as possible. Parabolas are better than straight lines, which are

     better than flat pieces. S beats M , which beats R: Check Simpson's rule on powers

     of x, with x D 1=n:

     Exact answers for x2 are no surprise. Sn was selected to get parabolas right. But the
     zero errors for x3 were not expected. The accuracy has jumped to fourth order, with
     errors proportional to .x/4: That explains the popularity of Simpson's rule.

      To understand why x3 is integrated exactly, look at the interval OE¡1; 1: The odd

     function x3 has zero integral, and Simpson agrees by symmetry:

                          THE GAUSS RULE (OPTIONAL)

We need a competitor for Simpson, and Gauss can compete with anybody. He
calculated integrals in astronomy, and discovered that two points are enough for

a fourth-order method. From ¡1 to 1 (a single interval) his rule is

                      ¡1 y.x/ dx y.¡1= 3/ C y.1= 3/:1                                       (9)

Those "Gauss points" x D ¡1= 3 and x D 1= 3 can be found directly. By placing

them symmetrically, all odd powers x; x3; : : : are correctly integrated. The key is in

y D x2, whose integral is 2=3: The Gauss points ¡xG and CxG get this integral

right:

           2 D .¡xG/2 C .xG/2; so xG2 D 1 and xG D ¨ 1 :
           3                                         3                         3

  Figure 5.20c shifts to the interval from 0 to x: The Gauss points are

.1 ¨ 1= 3/x=2: They are not as convenient as Simpson's (which hand calcula-

tors prefer). Gauss is good for thousands of integrations over one interval. Simpson is

good when intervals go back to back--then Simpson also uses two y's per interval.

For y D x4, you see both errors drop by 10¡4 in comparing n D 1 to n D 10:

        I D 01 x4 dx      Simpson error           8:33 ¤ 10¡3             8:33 ¤ 10¡7

                    DEFINITE INTEGRALS ON A CALCULATOR

It is fascinating to know how numerical integration is actually done. The points are

not equally spaced! For an integral from 0 to 1, Hewlett-Packard machines might

internally replace x by 3u2 ¡ 2u3 (the limits on u are also 0 and 1). The machine

remembers to change dx: For example,

           ÷ 1 dx     becomes  ÷ 1 6.u ¡ u2/du ÷ 1 D 6.1 ¡ u/du:
            0x                 0 3u2 ¡ 2u3 0 3 ¡ 2u

Algebraically that looks worse--but the infinite value of 1= x at x D 0 disappears

at u D 0: The differential 6.u ¡ u2/du was chosen to vanish at u D 0 and u D 1: We

don't need y.x/ at the endpoints--where infinity is most common. In the u variable

the integration points are equally spaced--therefore in x they are not.

  When a difficult point is inside OEa; b, break the interval in two pieces. And chop

off integrals that go out to infinity. The integral of e¡x2 should be stopped by x D 10,
280                             5 Integrals

     since the tail is so thin. (It is bad to go too far.) Rapid oscillations are among the
     toughest--the answer depends on cancellation of highs and lows, and the
     calculator requires many integration points.

       The change from x to u affects periodic functions. I thought equal spacing was
     good, since 1=.10 C cos 2x/ was integrated above to enormous accuracy. But there
     is a danger called aliasing. If sin 8x is sampled with x D 1=8, it is always zero.
     A high frequency 8 is confused with a low frequency 0 (its "alias" which agrees at
     the sample points). With unequal spacing the problem disappears. Notice how any
     integration method can be deceived:

     Ask for the integral of y D 0 and specify the accuracy. The calculator

     samples y at x1; : : : ; xk: (With a PAUSE key, the x's may be displayed.)

     Then integrate Y .x/ D .x ¡ x1/2 ¤ ¤ ¤ .x ¡ xk/2: That also returns the

     answer zero (now wrong), because the calculator follows the same steps.

       On the calculator you enter the function, the endpoints, and the accuracy. The

     variable x can be named or not (see the margin). The outputs 4:67077 and 4.7E-5
     are the requested integral 12 ex dx and the estimated error bound. Your input

 Exponentials and Logarithms

This chapter is devoted to exponentials like 2x and 10x and above all ex: The goal
is to understand them, differentiate them, integrate them, solve equations with them,
and invert them (to reach the logarithm). The overwhelming importance of ex makes
this a crucial chapter in pure and applied mathematics.

  In the traditional order of calculus books, ex waits until other applications of the
integral are complete. I would like to explain why it is placed earlier here. I believe
that the equation dy=dx D y has to be emphasized above techniques of integration.
The laws of nature are expressed by differential equations, and at the center is ex: Its
applications are to life sciences and physical sciences and economics and engineering
(and more--wherever change is influenced by the present state). The model produces
a differential equation and I want to show what calculus can do.

  The key is always bmCn D .bm/.bn/: Section 6:1 applies that rule in three ways:
   1. to understand the logarithm as the exponent;

                                  6.1 An Overview

     There is a good chance you have met logarithms. They turn multiplication into

     addition, which is a lot simpler. They are the basis for slide rules (not so important)

     and for graphs on log paper (very important). Logarithms are mirror images of

     exponentials--and those I know you have met.
       Start with exponentials. The numbers 10 and 102 and 103 are basic to the decimal

     system. For completeness I also include 100; which is "ten to the zeroth power" or
     1: The logarithms of those numbers are the exponents. The logarithms of 1 and
     10 and 100 and 1000 are 0 and 1 and 2 and 3: These are logarithms "to base 10,"
     because the powers are powers of 10:

     Question When the base changes from 10 to b, what is the logarithm of 1 ?
     Answer Since b0 D 1, log b 1 is always zero. To base b, the logarithm of bn is n:
     Negative powers are also needed. The number 10x is positive, but its exponent x can

     be negative. The first examples are 1=10 and 1=100, which are the same as 10¡1 and

     10¡2: The logarithms are the exponents ¡1 and ¡2:

                         1000D 103                and          log 1000D 3

                         1=1000D 10¡3 and log 1=1000D ¡3:

     Multiplying 1000 times 1=1000 gives 1 D 100: Adding logarithms gives 3 C .¡3/ D

     0: Always 10m times 10n equals 10mCn: In particular 103 times 102 produces five
     tens:

     .10/.10/.10/ times .10/.10/ equals .10/.10/.10/.10/.10/ D 105:

     The law for bm times bn extends to all exponents, as in 104:6 times 10: Furthermore
     the law applies to all bases (we restrict the base to b 0 and b ¤ 1). In every case
     multiplication of numbers is addition of exponents.

     6A bm times bn equals bmCn, so logarithms (exponents) add

         bm divided by bn equals bm¡n, so logarithms (exponents) subtract

      logb.yz/ D logb y C log b z and log b.y=z/ D logb y ¡ logb z: (1)

        Historical note In the days of slide rules, 1:2 and 1:3 were multiplied by sliding
     one edge across to 1:2 and reading the answer under 1:3: A slide rule made in
     Germany would give the third digit in 1:56: Its photograph shows the numbers on a
     log scale. The distance from 1 to 2 equals the distance from 2 to 4 and from 4 to 8:

     By sliding the edges, you add distances and multiply numbers.

      Division goes the other way. Notice how 1000=10 D 100 matches 3 ¡ 1 D 2: To

     divide 1:56 by 1:3, look back along line D for the answer 1:2:

       The second figure, though smaller, is the important one. When x increases by
     1; 2x is multiplied by 2. Adding to x multiplies y: This rule easily gives y D 1; 2; 4; 8;

     but look ahead to calculus--which doesn't stay with whole numbers.

     Calculus will add x: Then y is multiplied by 2x: This number is near 1:
     If x D 110 then 2x 1:07--the tenth root of 2: To find the slope, we have to
               .2x    ¡                                        ¡       1
     consider            1/=x  .  The  limit  is  near  .1:07     1/=  10  D  :7,  but  the  exact  number

     will take time.

    Fig. 6.1 An ancient relic (the slide rule). When exponents x add, powers 2x multiply.

   Base Change Bases other than 10 and exponents other than 1; 2; 3; : : : are needed
for applications. The population of the world x years from now is predicted to grow by
a factor close to 1:02x: Certainly x does not need to be a whole number of years. And
certainly the base 1:02 should not be 10 (or we are in real trouble). This prediction
will be refined as we study the differential equations for growth. It can be rewritten to
base 10 if that is preferred (but look at the exponent):

                          1:02x is the same as 10.log 1:02/x:

When the base changes from 1:02 to 10, the exponent is multiplied--as we now see.
  For practice, start with base b and change to base a: The logarithm to base a will

be written "log :" Everything comes from the rule that logarithm D exponent:

                        base change for numbers W b D alog b:

Now raise both sides to the power x: You see the change in the exponent:

                   base change for exponentials W bx D a.log b/x:

Finally set y D bx: Its logarithm to base b is x: Its logarithm to base a is the exponent
on the right hand side: loga y D .loga b/x: Now replace x by logb y:

             base change for logarithms W loga y D .loga b/.logb y/:

We absolutely need this ability to change the base. An example with a D 2 is

   b D 8 D 23 82 D .23/2 D 26 log2 64 D 3 ¤ 2 D .log2 8/.log8 64/:

  The rule behind base changes is .am/x D amx: When the mth power is raised
to the xth power, the exponents multiply. The square of the cube is the sixth power:

     .a/.a/.a/ times .a/.a/.a/ equals .a/.a/.a/.a/.a/.a/ W .a3/2 D a6:

Another base will soon be more important than 10--here are the rules for base changes:
286  6 Exponentials and Logarithms

     6B To change numbers, powers, and logarithms from base b to base a, use

     b D aloga b bx D a.loga b/x loga y D .loga b/.logb y/                    (2)

     The first is the definition. The second is the xth power of the first. The third is the
     logarithm of the second (remember y is bx). An important case is y D a:

     loga a D .loga b/.logb a/ D 1 so loga b D 1= logb a:                                 (3)

     EXAMPLE 8 D 23 means 81=3 D 2: Then .log2 8/.log8 2/ D .3/.1=3/ D 1:

       This completes the algebra of logarithms. The addition rules 6A came from
     .bm/.bn/ D bmCn: The multiplication rule 6B came from .am/x D amx: We still
     need to define bx and ax for all real numbers x. When x is a fraction, the defi-
     nition is easy. The square root of a8 is a4.m D 8 times x D 1=2/: When x is not a
     fraction, as in 2; the graph suggests one way to fill in the hole.

       We could define 2 as the limit of 23; 231=10; 2314=100; : : : : As the fractions
     r approach , the powers 2r approach 2 : This makes y D 2x into a continuous
     function, with the desired properties .2m/.2n/ D 2mCn and .2m/x D 2mx--whether

     m and n and x are integers or not. But the "'s and i's of continuity are not attractive,

     and we eventually choose (in Section 6:4) a smoother approach based on integrals.

     GRAPHS OF bx AND logb y

     It is time to draw graphs. In principle one graph should do the job for both functions,
     because y D bx means the same as x D logb y: These are inverse functions. What
     one function does, its inverse undoes. The logarithm of g.x/ D bx is x:

     g¡1.g.x// D logb.bx/ D x:                                                            (4)

     In the opposite direction, the exponential of the logarithm of y is y:

     g.g¡1.y// D b.logb y/ D y:                                                           (5)

     This holds for every base b, and it is valuable to see b D 2 and b D 4 on the same

     graph. Figure 6.2a shows y D 2x and y D 4x: Their mirror images in the 45¥ line

     give the logarithms to base 2 and base 4, which are in the right graph.
       When x is negative, y D bx is still positive. If the first graph is extended to the

     left, it stays above the x axis. Sketch it in with your pencil. Also extend the second

     graph down, to be the mirror image. Don't cross the vertical axis.

     Fig. 6.2 Exponentials and mirror images (logarithms). Different scales for x and y:
                     6.1 An Overview                                                    287

  There are interesting relations within the left figure. All exponentials start at 1,
because b0 is always 1: At the height y D 16, one graph is above x D 2 (because
42 D 16). The other graph is above x D 4 (because 24 D 16). Why does 4x in one
graph equal 22x in the other ? This is the base change for powers, since 4 D 22:

  The figure on the right shows the mirror image--the logarithm. All logarithms

start from zero at y D 1: The graphs go down to ¡ at y D 0: (Roughly speaking

2¡ is zero.) Again x in one graph corresponds to 2x in the other (base change for

logarithms). Both logarithms climb slowly, since the exponentials climb so fast.

  The number log2 10 is between 3 and 4, because 10 is between 23 and 24: The
slope of 2x is proportional to 2x--which never happened for xn: But there are two
practical difficulties with those graphs:

      1. 2x and 4x increase too fast. The curves turn virtually straight up.
      2. The most important fact about Abx is the value of b--and the base

           doesn't stand out in the graph.

There is also another point. In many problems we don't know the function y D f .x/:
We are looking for it! All we have are measured values of y (with errors mixed in).
When the values are plotted on a graph, we want to discover f .x/:

Fortunately there is a solution. Scale the y axis differently. On ordinary graphs,

each unit upward adds a fixed amount to y: On a log scale each unit multiplies y

by a fixed amount. The step from y D 1 to y D 2 is the same length as the step from

3 to 6 or 10 to 20:

On a log scale, y D 11 is not halfway between 10 and 12: And y D 0 is not there

at all. Each step down divides by a fixed amount--we never reach zero. This is
completely satisfactory for Abx, which also never reaches zero.

  Figure 6.3 is on semilog paper (also known as log-linear), with an ordinary x
axis. The graph of y D Abx is a straight line. To see why, take logarithms of that

equation:

                     log y D log A C x log b:                           (6)

The relation between x and log y is linear. It is really log y that is plotted, so the
graph is straight. The markings on the y axis allow you to enter y without looking up
its logarithm--you get an ordinary graph of log y against x:

 Figure 6.3 shows two examples. One graph is an exact plot of y D 2 ¤ 10x: It goes

upward with slope 1; because a unit across has the same length as multiplication by
10 going up. 10x has slope 1 and 10.log b/x (which is bx) will have slope log b.
The crucial number log b can be measured directly as the slope.

  The second graph in Figure 6.3 is more typical of actual practice, in which we start
with measurements and look for f .x/: Here are the data points:

                     x D 0:0 0:2 0:4 0:6 0:8 1:0
                     y D 4:0 3:2 2:4 2:0 1:6 1:3

We don't know in advance whether these values fit the model y D Abx: The graph
is strong evidence that they do. The points lie close to a line with negative slope--
indicating log b 0 and b 1: The slope down is half of the earlier slope up, so the
model is consistent with

                     y D A ¤ 10¡x=2  or  log  y  D  log  A  ¡  1  x  :  (7)
                                                               2

When x reaches 2, y drops by a factor of 10: At x D 0 we see A 4:

     Fig. 6.3 2 ¤ 10x and 4 ¤ 10¡x=2 on semilog paper. Fig. 6.4 Graphs of Axk on log-log paper.

       Another model--a power y D Axk instead of an exponential--also stands out with

     logarithmic scaling. This time we use log-log paper, with both axes scaled. The
     logarithm of y D Axk gives a linear relation between log y and log x:

                                   log y D log A C k log x:                                 (8)

     The exponent k becomes the slope on log-log paper. The base b makes no

     difference. We just measure the slope, and a straight line is a lot more attractive

     than a power curve.                                         ¡1:

     The  graphs  in  Figure  6.4  have  slopes  3  and  1  and       They  represent  Ax3  and

     A x and A=x: To find the A's, look at one point on the line. At x D 4 the height is

     8; so adjust the A's to make this happen: The functions are x3=8 and 4 x and 32=x:

     On semilog paper those graphs would not be straight!

     You can buy log paper or create it with computer graphics.

                          THE DERIVATIVES OF y D bx AND x D logb y

     This is a calculus book. We have to ask about slopes. The algebra of exponents is
     done, the rules are set, and on log paper the graphs are straight. Now come limits.

       The central question is the derivative. What is dy=dx when y D bx ? What is
     dx=dy when x is the logarithm logb y ? Those questions are closely related, be-
     cause bx and logb y are inverse functions. If one slope can be found, the other is
     known from dx=dy D 1=.dy=dx/: The problem is to find one of them, and the ex-
     ponential comes first.

       You will now see that those questions have quick (and beautiful) answers, except
     for a mysterious constant. There is a multiplying factor c which needs more time.
        6.1 An Overview                                                                 289

I think it is worth separating out the part that can be done immediately, leaving c
in dy=dx and 1=c in dx=dy: Then Section 6:2 discovers c by studying the special
number called e (but c ¤ e).

6C The derivative of bx is a multiple cbx: The number c depends on the base b:

The product and power and chain rules do not yield this derivative. We are pushed all
the way back to the original definition, the limit of y=x:

dy D lim y.x C h/ ¡ y.x/ D lim bxCh ¡ bx : (9)
dx h 0    h           h0                         h

Key idea: Split bxCh into bx times bh: Then the crucial quantity bx factors out.
More than that, bx comes outside the limit because it does not depend on h: The

remaining limit, inside the brackets, is the number c that we don't yet know:

dy D lim bxbh ¡ bx D bx lim b " h ¡ 1 D cbx # : (10)
dx h 0 h              h0 h

This equation is central to the whole chapter: dy=dx equals cbx which equals cy:
The rate of change of y is proportional to y. The slope increases in the same way
that bx increases (except for the factor c). A typical example is money in a bank,

where interest is proportional to the principal. The rich get richer, and the poor get
slightly richer. We will come back to compound interest, and identify b and c:

  The inverse function is x D logb y: Now the unknown factor is 1=c:

6D The slope of logb y is 1=cy with the same c (depending on b).

Proof If dy=dx D cbx then dx=dy D 1=cbx D 1=cy:                   (11)

That proof was like a Russian toast, powerful but too quick! We go more carefully:

        f .bx/ D x    (logarithm of exponential)

f ½.bx/.cbx/ D 1      .x derivative by chain rule/
     f ½.bx/ D 1=cbx  .divide by cbx/
       f ½.y/ D 1=cy  .identify bx as y/

The logarithm gives another way to find c: From its slope we can discover 1=c: This
is the way that finally works (next section).

      Fig. 6.5 The slope of 2x is about .7 ¤ 2x : The slope of log2 y is about 1=:7y:

Final remark It is extremely satisfying to meet an f .y/ whose derivative is 1=cy:

At last the "¡1 power" has an antiderivative. Remember that xndx D xnC1=.n C

                        1/ is a failure when n D ¡1: The derivative of x0 (a constant) does not produce x¡1

                        We had no integral for x¡1, and the logarithm fills that gap. If y is replaced by

                        x or t (all dummy variables) then

                                                 d       logb x D    1                 d              1
                                                                            and              logb t D :                        (12)

                        The base b can be chosen so that c D 1: Then the derivative is 1=x: This final touch
                        comes from the magic choice b D e--the highlight of Section 6.2.

                          6.2 The Exponential ex

     The last section discussed bx and logb y: The base b was arbitrary--it could be 2
     or 6 or 9:3 or any positive number except 1: But in practice, only a few bases are
     used. I have never met a logarithm to base 6 or 9:3: Realistically there are two
     leading candidates for b, and 10 is one of them. This section is about the other one,

     which is an extremely remarkable number. This number is not seen in arithmetic or

     algebra or geometry, where it looks totally clumsy and out of place. In calculus it

     comes into its own.

       The number is e: That symbol was chosen by Euler (initially in a fit of selfishness,

     but he was a wonderful mathematician). It is the base of the natural logarithm. It
     also controls the exponential ex, which is much more important than ln x: Euler also
     chose  to stand for perimeter--anyway, our first goal is to find e:

       Remember that the derivatives of bx and logb y include a constant c that depends
     on b: Equations (10) and (11) in the previous section were

                      d bx D cbx and d logb y D 1 : (1)
                      dx    dy                    cy

     At x D 0, the graph of bx starts from b0 D 1: The slope is c: At y D 1, the graph of

     logb y starts from logb 1 D 0: The logarithm has slope 1=c: With the right choice
     of the base b those slopes will equal 1 (because c will equal 1).

       For y D 2x the slope c is near :7: We already tried x D :1 and found y :07:

     The base has to be larger than 2; for a starting slope of c D 1:

       We begin with a direct computation of the slope of logb y at y D 1:

     1 D slope at 1 D lim 1 logb.1 C h/ h ¡ logb 1 D lim logb .1 C h/ i h 1=h : (2) i
     c                h 0h                 h0

     Always logb 1 D 0: The fraction in the middle is logb.1 C h/ times the number 1= h:
     This number can go up into the exponent, and it did.

       The quantity .1 C h/1=h is unusual, to put it mildly. As h 0, the number 1 C h

     is approaching 1: At the same time, 1= h is approaching infinity. In the limit we
     have 1 : But that expression is meaningless (like 0=0). Everything depends on the

     balance between "nearly 1" and "nearly :" This balance produces the extraordinary

     number e:

     DEFINITION The number e is equal to lim .1 C h/1=h: Equivalently
          1 n h 0
     e D lim 1 C :
     h0  n

     Before computing e, look again at the slope 1=c: At the end of equation (2) is the

     logarithm of e:

                            1=c D logb e:                (3)

     When the base is b D e; the slope is loge e D 1: That base e has c D 1 as desired:

        The derivative of ex is 1 ¤ ex and the derivative of log e y is 1 : (4)
                                                    1¤y

     This is why the base e is all-important in calculus. It makes c D 1:
       To compute the actual number e from .1 C h/1=h, choose h D 1; 1=10; 1=100; : : : :

     Then the exponents 1= h are n D 1; 10; 100; : : :: (All limits and derivatives will
     become official in Section 6:4:) The table shows .1 C h/1=h approaching e as

     h 0 and n :

The last column is converging to e (not quickly). There is an infinite series that
converges much faster. We know 125; 000 digits of e (and a billion digits of ). There
are no definite patterns, although you might think so from the first sixteen digits:

         e D2:7 1828 1828 45 90 45 ¤ ¤ ¤ .and1=e :37/:

The powers of e produce y D ex: At x D 2:3 and 5; we are close to y D 10 and 150:

  The logarithm is the inverse function. The logarithms of 150 and 10; to the base
e, are close to x D 5 and x D 2:3: There is a special name for this logarithm--the
natural logarithm. There is also a special notation "ln" to show that the base is e:

ln y means the same as loge y: The natural logarithm is the exponent in ex D y:

The notation ln y (or ln x--it is the function that matters, not the variable) is standard
in calculus courses. After calculus, the base is generally assumed to be e: In most of

science and engineering, the natural logarithm is the automatic choice. The symbol
"exp .x/" means ex, and the truth is that the symbol "log x" generally means ln x:
Base e is understood even without the letters ln : But in any case of doubt--on a
calculator key for example--the symbol "ln x" emphasizes that the base is e:

                            THE DERIVATIVES OF ex AND ln x

Come back to derivatives and slopes. The derivative of bx is cbx; and the derivative
of logb y is 1=cy: If b D e then c D 1. For all bases, equation (3) is 1=c D logb e:
This gives c--the slope of bx at x D 0:

6E The number c is 1= logb e D log e b: Thus c equals ln b.           (5)

c D ln b is the mysterious constant that was not available earlier. The slope of
2x is ln 2 times 2x: The slope of ex is ln e times ex (but ln e D 1). We have the

derivatives on which this chapter depends:

6F The derivatives of ex and ln y are ex and 1=y: For other bases

d bx D .ln b/bx and d logb y D 1 : (6)
dx                                 dy           .ln b/y

To make clear that those derivatives come from the functions (and not at all from the
dummy variables), we rewrite them using t and x:

         d et D et and d ln x D 1 : (7)

294                            6 Exponentials and Logarithms

     Remark on slopes at x D 0: It would be satisfying to see directly that the slope
     of 2x is below 1; and the slope of 4x is above 1: Quick proof: e is between 2 and 4.

     But the idea is to see the slopes graphically. This is a small puzzle, which is fun to

     solve but can be skipped.
       2x rises from 1 at x D 0 to 2 at x D 1: On that interval its average slope is 1: Its

     slope at the beginning is smaller than average, so it must be less than 1--as desired.
                                            1            ¡ 12
     On  the  other  hand  4x  rises  from  2  at  x  D        to  1  at  x  D  0:  Again  the  average  slope

     is 2 2 1 i 1 D 1: Since x D 0 comes at the end of this new interval, the slope of 4x at that
     point exceeds 1: Somewhere between 2x and 4x is ex, which starts out with slope 1:

       This is the graphical approach to e: There is also the infinite series, and a fifth
     definition through integrals which is written here for the record:

     1. e is the number such that ex has slope 1 at x D 0

     2. e is the base for which ln y D loge y has slope 1 at y D 1
                            1 n

     3. e is the limit of 1 C as n
                                  n

     5. the area e1x¡1dx equals 1:

     The connections between 1, 2, and 3 have been made. The slopes are 1 when e is
     the limit of .1 C 1=n/n: Multiplying this out wlll lead to 4, the infinite series in

     Section 6.6. The official definition of ln x comes from dx=x, and then 5 says that

     ln e D 1: This approach to e (Section 6.4) seems less intuitive than the others.

       Figure 6.6b shows the graph of e¡x: It is the mirror image of ex across the
     vertical axis. Their product is exe¡x D 1: Where ex grows exponentially, e¡x

     decays exponentially--or it grows as x approaches ¡ : Their growth and decay

     are faster than any power of x. Exponential growth is more rapid than polynomial
     growth, so that ex=xn goes to infinity (Problem 59). It is the fact that ex has slope
     ex which keeps the function climbing so fast.

           Fig. 6.6 ex grows between 2x and 4x : Decay of e¡x; faster decay of e¡x2=2:

       The other curve is y D e¡x2=2: This is the famous "bell-shaped curve" of

     probability theory. After dividing by 2, it gives the normal distribution, which
     applies to so many averages and so many experiments. The Gallup Poll will be an
     example in Section 8.4. The curve is symmetric around its mean value x D 0, since

     changing x to ¡x has no effect on x2:
      About two thirds of the area under this curve is between x D ¡1 and x D 1: If

     you pick points at random below the graph, 2=3 of all samples are expected in that

     interval. The points x D ¡2 and x D 2 are "two standard deviations" from the center,

     enclosing 95% of the area. There is only a 5% chance of landing beyond. The decay
     is even faster than an ordinary exponential, because 12 x2 has replaced x:

                           THE DERIVATIVES OF ecx AND eu.x/
The slope of ex is ex: This opens up a whole world of functions that calculus can
deal with. The chain rule gives the slope of e3x and esin x and every eu.x/:

EXAMPLE 1 The derivative of e3x is 3e3x (here c D 3). The derivative of esin x
is esin x cos x (here u D sin x). The derivative of f .u.x// is df =du times du=dx:
Here f D eu so df =du D eu: The chain rule demands that second factor du=dx.

EXAMPLE 2 e.ln 2/x is the same as 2x: Its derivative is ln 2 times 2x: The
chain rule rediscovers our constant c D ln 2: In the slope of bx it rediscovers
the factor c D ln b:

Generally ecx is preferred to the original bx: The derivative just brings down the
constant c: It is better to agree on e as the base, and put all complications (like
c D ln b) up in the exponent. The second derivative of ecx is c2ecx :

                                                                          (10)

Notice how the exponential survives. With every derivative it is multiplied by more

factors, but it is still there to dominate growth or decay. The points of inflection,

where the bell-shaped curve has f ¾ D 0 in equation (10), are x D 1 and x D ¡1.

EXAMPLE 5 .u D n ln x/: Since enln x is xn in disguise, its slope must be nxn¡1:

          slope D enln x d .n ln x/ D xn D nx  n  n¡1: (11)
                           dx                   x

This slope is correct for all n; integer or not. Chapter 2 produced 3x2 and 4x3

from the binomial theorem. Now nxn¡1 comes from ln and exp and the chain rule.

EXAMPLE 6 An extreme case is xx D .eln x/x: Here u D x ln x and we need du=dx:

          dx                               1

          INTEGRALS OF ecx AND eu du=dx

The integral of ex is ex: The integral of ecx is not ecx. The derivative multiplies by
c so the integral divides by c: The integral of ecx is ecx=c (plus a constant).

The first one has c D 2: The second has c D ln b--remember again that bx D e.ln b/x:
The integral divides by ln b: In the third one, e3.xC1/ is e3x times the number e3
296                6 Exponentials and Logarithms

     and that number is carried along. Or more likely we see e3.xC1/ as eu: The missing
     du=dx D 3 is fixed by dividing by 3: The last example fails because du=dx is not
     there. We cannot integrate without du=dx:

                                                                ÷

       6H The indefinite integral eu du dx equals eu.x/ C C:
                                              dx

     Here are three examples with du=dx and one without it:

        ÷                               ÷

          esin x cos x dx D esin x C C    xex2=2 dx D ex2=2 C C

                                           .1 C ex/2 1 C e

     The first is a pure eudu: So is the second. The third has u D x and du=dx D

     1=2 x,

     so only the factor 2 had to be fixed. The fourth example does not belong with the
     others. It is the integral of du=u2, not the integral of eudu: I don't know any way
     to tell you which substitution is best--except that the complicated part is 1 C ex and

     it is natural to substitute u. If it works, good.
       Without an extra ex for du=dx; the integral dx=.1 C ex/2 looks bad. But

     u D 1 C ex is still worth trying. It has du D exdx D .u ¡ 1/dx:

        ÷ dx          ÷ du              ÷  1 1 1
                   D        2 D du                           ¡ ¡2 :       (12)
        .1 C ex/2 .u ¡ 1/u                                u¡1 u u

     That last step is "partial fractions." The integral splits into simpler pieces (explained
     in Section 7:4) and we integrate each piece. Here are three other integrals:

        ÷             ÷                    ÷
           e1=x dx ex .4 C ex/dx e¡x .4 C ex/dx

     The first can change to ¡ eudu=u2, which is not much better. (It is just as

     impossible.) The second is actually u du, but I prefer a split: 4ex and e2x are

     safer to do separately. The third is .4e¡x C 1/dx, which also separates. The

     exercises offer practice in reaching eudu=dx--ready to be integrated.

     Warning about definite integrals When the lower limit is x D 0, there is a natural
     tendency to expect f .0/ D 0--in which case the lower limit contributes nothing. For
     a power f D x3 that is true. For an exponential f D e3x it is definitely not true,
     because f .0/ D 1:

     6.3 Growth and Decay in Science and Economics

The derivative of y D ecx has taken time and effort. The result was y½ D cecx; which
means that y½ D cy. That computation brought others with it, virtually for free--the
derivatives of bx and xx and eu.x/: But I want to stay with y½ D cy--which is the

most important differential equation in applied mathematics.
Compare y½ D x with y½ D y. The first only asks for an antiderivative of x: We
                     1
quickly  find  y  D  2  x2  C  C:  The  second  has  dy=dx  equal  to  y  itself--which  we  rewrite

as dy=y D dx: The integral is in y D x C C: Then y itself is exec : Notice that the
first solution is 12 x2 plus a constant, and the second solution is ex times a constant.

  There is a way to graph slope x versus slope y: Figure 6.7 shows "tangent arrows,"
which give the slope at each x and y: For parabolas, the arrows grow steeper as

x grows--because y½ D slope D x: For exponentials, the arrows grow steeper as y
grows--the equation is y½ D slope D y: Now the arrows are connected by y D Aex:

A differential equation gives a field of arrows (slopes). Its solution is a curve that
stays tangent to the arrows--then the curve has the right slope.

     Fig. 6.7 The slopes are y½ D x and y½ D y: The solution curves fit those slopes.

A field of arrows can show many solutions at once (this comes in a differential

equations course). Usually a single y0 is not sacred. To understand the equation we

start from many y0--on the left the parabolas stay parallel, on the right the heights

stay proportional. For y½ D ¡y all solution curves go to zero.

  From y½ D y it is a short step to y½ D cy: To make c appear in the derivative, put

c into the exponent. The derivative of y D ecx is cecx; which is c times y: We have

reached the key equation, which comes with an initial condition--a starting value

y0:

                               dy=dt D cy with y D y0 at t D 0:                              (1)

A small change: x has switched to t: In most applications time is the natural variable,
rather than space. The factor c becomes the "growth rate" or "decay rate"--and ecx
converts to ect :
300            6 Exponentials and Logarithms

       The last step is to match the initial condition. The problem requires y D y0 at
     t D 0: Our ect starts from ec0 D 1: The constant of integration is needed now--the
     solutions are y D Aect : By choosing A D y0, we match the initial condition and
     solve equation (1). The formula to remember is y0ect :

     6I The exponential law y D y0ect solves y½ D cy starting from y0:

       The rate of growth or decay is c: May I call your attention to a basic fact ? The
     formula y0ect contains three quantities y0; c; t: If two of them are given, plus one
     additional piece of information, the third is determined. Many applications have one
     of these three forms: find t , find c, find y0:

       1. Find the doubling time T if c D 1=10: At that time y0ecT equals 2y0:

               ecT D 2 yields cT D ln 2 so that T D ln 2 :7 : (2)
                                                               c :1

     The question asks for an exponent T: The answer involves logarithms. If a cell
     grows at a continuous rate of c D 10% per day, it takes about :7=:1 D 7 days to
     double in size. (Note that :7 is close to ln 2:) If a savings account earns 10%
     continuous interest, it doubles in 7 years.

       In this problem we knew c: In the next problem we know T:

       2. Find the decay constant c for carbon-14 if y D 21 y0 in T D 5568 years.

               ecT D 21 yields cT D ln 21 so that c ln 21 =5568: (3)

     After the half-life T D 5568, the factor ecT  equals   21 : Now c  is  negative  .ln  1  D
     ¡ ln 2/:                                                                              2

     Question 1 was about growth. Question 2 was about decay. Both answers found

     ecT as the ratio y.T /=y.0/: Then cT is its logarithm. Note how c sticks to T:

     T has the units of time, c has the units of "1=time:"

     Main point: The doubling time is .ln 2/=c, because cT D ln 2: The time to multi-

     ply by e is 1=c: The time to multiply by 10 is .ln 10/=c: The time to divide by e is

     ¡1=c, when a negative c brings decay.

     3. Find the initial value y0 if c D 2 and y.1/ D 5:

               y.t / D y0ect yields y0 D y.t /e¡ct D 5e¡2:

All we do is run the process backward. Start from 5 and go back to y0: With time

reversed, ect becomes e¡ct : The product of e2 and e¡2 is 1--growth forward and

decay backward.
  Equally important is T C t: Go forward to time T and go on to T C t :

y.T C t / is y0ec.T Ct/ which is .y0ecT /ect :                                  (4)

Ever step t; at the start or later, multiplies by the same ect : This uses the fundamental
property of exponentials, that eT Ct D eT et :

EXAMPLE 1 Population growth from birth rate b and death rate d (both

constant):                                                            d (which

          dy=dt D by ¡ dy D cy .the net rate is c D b ¡ d /:

The population in this model is y0ect D y0ebt e¡dt : It grows when b

makes c 0). One estimate of the growth rate is c D 0:02=year:

The earth's population doubles in about T D ln 2                :7 D 35 years:
                                                          c     :02

First comment: We predict the future based on c: We count the past population to

find c: Changes in c are a serious problem for this model.
  Second comment: y0ect is not a whole number. You may prefer to think of bacteria

instead of people. (This section begins a major application of mathematics to

economics and the life sciences.) Malthus based his theory of human population

on this equation y½ D cy--and with large numbers a fraction of a person doesn't

matter so much. To use calculus we go from discrete to continuous. The theory

must fail when t is very large, since populations cannot grow exponentially forever.

Section 6.5 introduces the logistic equation y½ D cy ¡ by2, with a competition term
¡by2 to slow the growth.

  Third comment: The dimensions of b; c; d are "1=time." The dictionary gives birth

rate D number of births per person in a unit of time. It is a relative rate--people
divided by people and time. The product ct is dimensionless and ect makes sense

(also dimensionless). Some texts replace c by  (lambda). Then 1= is the growth

time or decay time or drug elimination time or diffusion time.

EXAMPLE 2 Radioactive dating A gram of charcoal from the cave paintings in
France gives 0:97 disintegrations per minute. A gram of living wood gives 6:68
disintegrations per minute. Find the age of those Lascaux paintings.

  The charcoal stopped adding radiocarbon when it was burned (at t D 0). The
amount has decayed to y0ect : In living wood this amount is still y0; because cosmic
rays maintain the balance. Their ratio is ect D 0:97=6:68. Knowing the decay rate c
from Question 2 above, we know the present time t :

 ct D ln 0:97 yields t D 5568  ln 0:97  D 14; 400 years:
6:68             ¡:7 6:68

Here is a related problem--the age of uranium. Right now there is 140 times as much
U-238 as U-235. Nearly equal amounts were created, with half-lives of .4:5/109 and
.0:7/109 years. Question: How long since uranium was created ? Answer: Find t by

     EXAMPLE 3 Calculus in Economics: price inflation and the value of money

     We begin with two inflation rates--a continuous rate and an annual rate. For the
     price change y over a year, use the annual rate:

     y D .annual rate/ times .y/ times .t /:                          (5)

     Calculus applies the continuous rate to each instant dt: The price change is dy:

     dy D .continuous rate/ times .y/ times .dt /:                    (6)

     Dividing by dt , this is a differential equation for the price:

                         dy=dt D .continuous rate/ times .y/ D :05y:

     The solution is y0e:05t : Set t D 1: Then e:05 1:0513 and the annual rate is 5:13%:

       When you ask a bank what interest they pay, they give both rates: 8% and 8:33%:
     The higher one they call the "effective rate." It comes from compounding (and
     depends how often they do it). If the compounding is continuous, every dt brings
     an increase of dy--and e:08 is near 1:0833:

       Section 6.6 returns to compound interest. The interval drops from a month to a day
     to a second. That leads to .1 C 1=n/n, and in the limit to e: Here we compute the
     effect of 5% continuous interest:

     Future value A dollar now has the same value as e:05T dollars in T years.

     Present value A dollar in T years has the same value as e¡:05T dollars now.

     Doubling time Prices double .e:05T D 2/ in T D ln 2=:05 14 years.

     With no compounding, the doubling time is 20 years. Simple interest adds on 20
     times 5% D 100%: With continuous compounding the time is reduced by the factor
     ln 2 :7, regardless of the interest rate.

     EXAMPLE 4 In 1626 the Indians sold Manhattan for $24: Our calculations in-
     dicate that they knew what they were doing. Assuming 8% compound interest, the
     original $24 is multiplied by e:08t : After t D 365 years the multiplier is e29:2 and the
     $24 has grown to 115 trillion dollars. With that much money they could buy back the

     land and pay off the national debt.

       This seems farfetched. Possibly there is a big flaw in the model. It is absolutely
     true that Ben Franklin left money to Boston and Philadelphia, to be invested for 200
     years. In 1990 it yielded millions (not trillions, that takes longer). Our next step is a
     new model.

     Question How can you estimate e29:2 with a $24 calculator (log but not ln) ?
     Answer Multiply 29:2 by log10 e D :434 to get 12:7: This is the exponent to base
     10. After that base change, we have 1012:7 or more than a trillion.

                            GROWTH OR DECAY WITH A SOURCE TERM

     The equation y½ D y will be given a new term. Up to now, all growth or decay has

     started from y0: No deposit or withdrawal was made later. The investment grew by
     itself--a pure exponential. The new term s allows you to add or subtract from the
6.3 Growth and Decay in Science and Economics                                                      303

account. It is a "source"--or a "sink" if s is negative. The source s D 5 adds 5dt ,
proportional to dt but not to y:

Constant source: dy=dt D y C 5 starting from y D y0:

Notice y on both sides! My first guess y D etC5 failed completely. Its derivative is
etC5 again, which is not y C 5: The class suggested y D et C 5t: But its derivative
et C 5 is still not y C 5: We tried other ways to produce 5 in dy=dt: This idea is

doomed to failure. Finally we thought of y D Aet ¡ 5. That has y½ D Aet D y C 5

as required.

 Important: A is not y0. Set t D 0 to find y0 D A ¡ 5: The source contributes 5et ¡

5:

    The solution is .y0 C 5/et ¡ 5: That is the same as y0et C 5.et ¡ 1/:
s D 5 multiplies the growth term et ¡ 1 that starts at zero. y0et grows as before.

EXAMPLE 5 dy=dt D ¡y C 5 has y D .y0 ¡ 5/e¡t C 5: This is y0e¡t C 5.1 ¡ e¡t/:

That final term from the source is still positive. The other term y0e¡t decays to zero.

The limit as t  i s y D 5. A negative c leads to a steady state y :
Based on these examples with c D 1 and c D ¡1, we can find y for any c and s.

EQUATION WITH SOURCE     dy
                             D cy C s starts from y D y0 at t D 0:(7)

                         dt

The source could be a deposit of s D $1000=year, after an initial investment of y0 D     Fig. 6.9

$8000: Or we can withdraw funds at s D ¡$200=year. The units are "dollars per

year" to match dy=dt: The equation feeds in $1000 or removes $200 continuously--
not all at once.

  Note again that y D e.cCs/t is not a solution. Its derivative is .c C s/y: The com-

bination y D ect C s is also not a solution (but closer). The analysis of y½ D cy C s

will be our main achievement for differential equations (in this section). The

equation is not restricted to finance--far from it--but that produces excellent exam-

ples.
  I propose to find y in four ways. You may feel that one way is enough. The first

way is the fastest--only three lines--but please give the others a chance. There is no

point in preparing for real problems if we don't solve them.

Solution by Method 1 (fast way) Substitute the combination y D Aect C B: The
solution has this form--exponential plus constant. From two facts we find A and

the equation B: y½ D cy C s gives cAect D c.Aect C B/ C s

the initial value at t D 0 gives A C B D y0:

The first line has cAect on both sides. Subtraction leaves cB C s D 0, or B D ¡s=c:
Then the second line becomes A D y0 ¡ B D y0 C .s=c/:

KEY FORMULA     y D y0 C e  s  ct ¡ s or y D y0ect C s ect ¡ 1: (8)
                      c  c                    c

With s D 0 this is the old solution y0ect (no source). The example with c D 1 and

s D 5 produced .y0 C 5/et ¡ 5: Separating the source term gives y0et C 5.et ¡ 1/:

 My class says one way is more than enough. They just want the answer. Sometimes I cave

in and write down the formula: y is y0ect plus s.ect ¡ 1/=c from the source term.
304                   6 Exponentials and Logarithms

     Solution by Method 2 (slow way) The input y0 produces the output y0ect : After t
     years any deposit is multiplied by ect : That also applies to deposits made after the

     account is opened. If the deposit enters at time T , the growing time is only t ¡ T:

     Therefore the multiplying factor is only ec.t¡T /: This growth factor applies to the

     small deposit (amount sd T ) made between time T and T C d T:
       Now add up all outputs at time t: The output from y0 is y0ect : The small deposit

     sd T near time T grows to ec.t¡T /sd T: The total is an integral:

                                           ÷t    ec.t¡T /sd T:

                      y.t / D y0ect C                                             (9)

                                           T D0

     This principle of Duhamel would still apply when the source s varies with time.
     Here s is constant, and the integral divides by c:

                   ÷t                      sec.t¡T / #t  s s ct

                          c.t¡T /
                   T D0 s e d T D ¡c D ¡ c C c e : (10)
                                                 0

     That agrees with the source term from Method 1; at the end of equation (8). There we

     looked for "exponential plus constant," here we added up outputs.
       Method 1 was easier. It succeeded because we knew the form Aect C B--with

     "undetermined coefficients." Method 2 is more complete. The form for y is part of the
     output, not the input. The source s is a continuous supply of new deposits, all growing

     separately. Section 6:5 starts from scratch, by directly integrating y½ D cy C s:

     Remark Method 2 is often described in terms of an integrating factor. First write

     the equation as y½ ¡ cy D s: Then multiply by a magic factor that makes integration

     possible:

     .y½ ¡ cy/e¡ct D se¡ct                       multiply by the factor e¡ct

                   ye¡ct D it ¡ s e¡ct it        integrate both sides
                   0  c            0             substitute 0 and t
                                                 isolate y to reach formula (8)
                ye¡ct ¡ y0 D ¡ s .e¡ct ¡ 1/

                                   c

                       y D ect y0 C s .ect ¡ 1/

                                           c

     The integrating factor produced a perfect derivative in line 1: I prefer Duhamel's idea,
     that all inputs y0 and s grow the same way. Either method gives formula (8) for y:

                THE MATHEMATICS OF FINANCE (AT A CONTINUOUS RATE)

     The question from finance is this: What inputs give what outputs ? The inputs can
     come at the start by y0, or continuously by s: The output can be paid at the end or

     continuously. There are six basic questions, two of which are already answered.
       The future value is y0ect from a deposit of y0: To produce y in the future,

     deposit the present value ye¡ct : Questions 3-6 involve the source term s. We fix

     the continuous rate at 5% per year .c D :05/, and start the account from y0 D 0: The
     answers come fast from equation (8).

     Question 3 With deposits of s D $1000=year; how large is y after 20 years ?

     y D s .ect ¡ 1/ D 1000 .e.:05/.20/ ¡ 1/ D 20; 000.e ¡ 1/ $34; 400:
                c     :05

     One big deposit yields 20; 000e $54; 000: The same 20; 000 via s yields $34; 400:
6.3 Growth and Decay in Science and Economics                                           305

  Notice a small by-product (for mathematicians). When the interest rate is c D 0,

our formula s.ect ¡ 1/=c turns into 0=0: We are absolutely sure that depositing

$1000=year with no interest produces $20; 000 after 20 years. But this is not obvious

from 0=0: By l'Hôpital's rule we take c-derivatives in the fraction:

lim s.ect ¡ 1/ D lim st ect D st: This is .1000/.20/ D 20; 000: (11)

Question 4 What continuous deposit of s per year yields $20; 000 after 20 years ?

20; 000 D s .e.:05/.20/ ¡ 1/ requires s D 1000 582:
      :05                               e¡1

Deposits of $582 over 20 years total $11; 640: A single deposit of y0 D 20; 000=e D
$7; 360 produces the same $20; 000 at the end. Better to be rich at t D 0:

  Questions 1 and 2 had s D 0 (no source). Questions 3 and 4 had y0 D 0 (no initial
deposit). Now we come to y D 0: In 5, everything is paid out by an annuity. In 6,

everything is paid up on a loan.

Question 5 What deposit y0 provides $1000=year for 20 years ? End with y D 0:

y D y0ect C s .ect ¡ 1/ D 0 requires y0 D ¡s .1 ¡ e¡ct /:
      c                                 c

Substituting s D ¡1000; c D :05; t D 20 gives y0 12; 640: If you win $20; 000 in

a lottery, and it is paid over 20 years, the lottery only has to put in $12; 640: Even

less if the interest rate is above 5%:

Question 6 What payments s will clear a loan of y0 D $20; 000 in 20 years ?

Unfortunately, s exceeds $1000 per year. The bank gives up more than the $20,000
to buy your car (and pay tuition). It also gives up the interest on that money. You
pay that back too, but you don't have to stay even at every moment. Instead you repay
at a constant rate for 20 years. Your payments mostly cover interest at the start and
principal at the end. After t D 20 years you are even and your debt is y D 0:

  This is like Question 5 (also y D 0), but now we know y0 and we want s:

       y D y0ect C s .ect ¡ 1/ D 0 requires s D ¡cy0ect =.ect ¡ 1/:

                           c

The loan is y0 D $20; 000, the rate is c D :05=year; the time is t D 20 years.
Substituting in the formula for s, your payments are $1582 per year.

Puzzle How is s D $1582 for loan payments related to s D $582 for deposits ?

  0 $582 per year $20; 000 and $20; 000 ¡$1582 per year 0:

That difference of exactly 1000 cannot be an accident. 1582 and 582 came from

1000 e and 1000 1 with difference 1000 e ¡ 1 D 1000:
e¡1        e¡1                             e¡1

Why ? Here is the real reason. Instead of repaying 1582 we can pay only 1000 (to
keep even with the interest on 20; 000). The other 582 goes into a separate account.
After 20 years the continuous 582 has built up to 20; 000 (including interest as in
Question 4). From that account we pay back the loan.

     At this steady state, the source s exactly balances the decay cy: In other words
     cy C s D 0: From the left side of the differential equation, this means dy=dt D 0:
     There is no change. That is why y is steady.

       Notice that y depends on the source and on c--but not on y0:

     EXAMPLE 6 Suppose Bermuda has a birth rate b D :02 and death rate d D :03:

     The net decay rate is c D ¡:01: There is also immigration from outside, of s D 1200=year:

     The initial population might be y0 D 5 thousand or y0 D 5 million, but that number

     has no effect on y : The steady state is independent of y0:

      In this case y D ¡s=c D 1200=:01 D 120; 000: The population grows to 120; 000

     if y0 is smaller. It decays to 120; 000 if y0 is larger.

     EXAMPLE 7 Newton's Law of Cooling: dy=dt D c.y ¡ y /:  (12)

     This is back to physics. The temperature of a body is y: The temperature around it
     is y : Then y starts at y0 and approaches y , following Newton's rule: The rate is

     proportional to y ¡ y . The bigger the difference, the faster heat flows.
      The equation has ¡cy where before we had s: That fits with y D ¡s=c: For the

     solution, replace s by ¡cy in formula (8). Or use this new method:
     Solution by Method 3 The new idea is to look at the difference y ¡ y . Its deriva-
     tive is dy=dt , since y is constant. But dy=dt is c.y ¡ y /--this is our equation.
     The difference starts from y0 ¡ y , and grows or decays as a pure exponential:

       d .y ¡ y / D c.y ¡ y / has the solution .y ¡ y / D .y0 ¡ y /ect : (13)

       dt
     This solves the law of cooling. We repeat Method 3 using the letters s and c:

     d y C D c y C has the solution y C D y0 C e  s   s   s   s  ct : (14)

           Moving s=c to the right side recovers formula (8). There is a constant term and
           an exponential term. In a differential equations course, those are the "particular
           solution" and the "homogeneous solution." In a calculus course, it's time to stop.

           EXAMPLE 8 In a 70¥ room, Newton's corpse is found with a temperature of 90¥:
           A day later the body registers 80¥: When did he stop integrating (at 98:6¥) ?

           Solution Here y D 70 and y0 D 90: Newton's equation (13) is y D 20ect C
           70: Then y D 80 at t D 1 gives 20ec D 10: The rate of cooling is c D ln 21 : Death

                                6.4 Logarithms

     We have given first place to ex and a lower place to ln x: In applications that is

     absolutely correct. But logarithms have one important theoretical advantage (plus

     many applications of their own). The advantage is that the derivative of ln x is 1=x;
     whereas the derivative of ex is ex: We can't define ex as its own integral, without

     circular reasoning. But we can and do define ln x (the natural logarithm) as the

     integral of the "¡1 power" which is 1=x:

            ln x D        ÷x 1      dx or ln y D             ÷y 1     du:       (1)

                             1x                                   1u

     Note the dummy variables, first x then u: Note also the live variables, first x then y:

     Especially note the lower limit of integration, which is 1 and not 0: The logarithm is

     the area measured from 1. Therefore ln 1 D 0 at that starting point--as required.

      Earlier chapters integrated all powers except this "¡1 power." The logarithm is

     that missing integral. The curve in Figure 6.11 has height y D 1=x--it is a hyperbola.

     At x D 0 the height goes to infinity and the area becomes infinite: log 0 D ¡ :

     The minus sign is because the integral goes backward from 1 to 0: The integral does

     not extend past zero to negative x: We are defining ln x only for x 0:

                    ¡ ln

                          2               2

       With this new approach, ln x has a direct definition. It is an integral (or an area).
     Its two key properties must follow from this definition. That step is a beautiful
     application of the theory behind integrals.

     Property 1: ln ab D ln a C ln b: The areas from 1 to a and from a to ab combine
     into a single area (1 to ab in the middle figure):

     Neighboring areas W               ÷a 1  dx C    ÷ ab 1  dx D  ÷ ab 1  dx:  (2)

     The right side is ln ab; from definition (1). The first term on the left is ln a: The
     problem is to show that the second integral (a to ab) is ln b:

                    ÷ ab 1                .</ ÷ b 1                             (3)
                                 dx D                du D ln b:
                          ax                     1u

     We need u D 1 when x D a (the lower limit) and u D b when x D ab (the upper
     limit). The choice u D x=a satisfies these requirements. Substituting x D au and dx D
     a du yields dx=x D du=u: Equation (3) gives ln b; and equation (2) is ln a C ln b D
     ln ab:

      The logarithm of ¡1 is i (an imaginary number). That is because ei D ¡1: The logarithm

     of i is also imaginary--it is 12  i: In general, logarithms are complex numbers.

Property 2: ln bn D n ln b: These are the left and right sides of

                               ÷ bn 1         .</ ÷ b 1                                   (4)

                               1x                       1u

This comes from the substitution x D un: The lower limit x D 1 corresponds to

u D 1; and x D bn corresponds to u D b: The differential dx is nun¡1du: Divid-

ing by x D un leaves dx=x D n du=u: Then equation (4) becomes ln bn D n ln b:

  Everything comes logically from the definition as an area. Also definite integrals:

Remark While working on the theory this is a chance to straighten out old debts.
The book has discussed and computed (and even differentiated) the functions ex and
bx and xn; without defining them properly. When the exponent is an irrational num-

ber like ; how do we multiply e by itself  times ? One approach (not taken) is

to come closer and closer to  by rational exponents like 22=7: Another approach
(taken now) is to determine the number e D 23:1 : : : by its logarithm. Start with e

itself:     e is (by definition) the number whose logarithm is 1

            e is (by definition) the number whose logarithm is :

When the area in Figure 6.12 reaches 1; the basepoint is e. When the area reaches
; the basepoint is e : We are constructing the inverse function (which is ex). But

how do we know that the area reaches  or 1000 or ¡1000 at exactly one point ? (The
area is 1000 far out at e1000: The area is ¡1000 very near zero at e¡1000:) To define

e we have to know that somewhere the area equals 1!

For a proof in two steps, go back to Figure 6.11c. The area from 1 to 2 is more
         1                                 1
than     2  (because  1=x  is  more  than  2  on  that  interval  of  length  one).  The  combined

area from 1 to 4 is more than 1: We come to area D 1 before reaching 4: (Actually

at e D 2:718 : : ::) Since 1=x is positive, the area is increasing and never comes back

to 1:

To double the area we have to square the distance. The logarithm creeps up-

wards:
                                ln x but ln x 0: (5)
                                                       x

The logarithm grows slowly because ex grows so fast (and vice versa--they are
inverses). Remember that ex goes past every power xn: Therefore ln x is passed by
every root x1=n: Problems 60 and 61 give two proofs that .ln x/=x1=n approaches

zero.

  We might compare ln x with x: At x D 10 they are close (2:3 versus 3:2). But
out at x D e10 the comparison is 10 against e5; and ln x loses to x:

 Chapter 9 goes on to imaginary exponents, and proves the remarkable formula ei D ¡1:

                The limiting cases ln 0 D ¡ and ln D C are important. More important are

                logarithms near the starting point ln 1 D 0: Our question is: What is ln.1 C x/ for x
                near zero ? The exact answer is an area. The approximate answer is much simpler.
                If x (positive or negative) is small, then

                                      ln.1 C x/ x and ex 1 C x:                                           (6)

                The calculator gives ln 1:01 D :0099503: This is close to x D :01: Between 1 and

                1 C x the area under the graph of 1=x is nearly a rectangle. Its base is x and its

                height is 1: So the curved area ln.1 C x/ is close to the rectangular area x:

                Figure 6.14 shows how a small triangle is chopped off at the top.

                  May I switch to ex ? Its slope starts at e0 D 1; so its linear approximation is 1 C x:

                Then ln.ex/ ln.1 C x/ x: Two wrongs do make a right: ln.ex/ D x exactly.

                                           DERIVATIVES BASED ON LOGARITHMS

                Logarithms turn up as antiderivatives very often. To build up a collection of integrals,
                we now differentiate ln u.x/ by the chain rule.

                                                 1                                 1 du

The slope of ln x was hard work in Section 6:2: With its new definition (the integral
of 1=x) the work is gone. By the Fundamental Theorem, the slope must be 1=x:

  For ln u.x/ the derivative comes from the chain rule. The inside function is u; the
outside function is ln : (Keep u 0 to define ln u:) The chain rule gives

d ln cx D 1 c D 1 .S/               d ln x3 D 3x2=x3 D 3
dx         cx x                     dx                              x

dx                                  dx                 ln x x

Those are worth another look, especially the first. Any reasonable person would
expect the slope of ln 3x to be 3=x: Not so. The 3 cancels, and ln 3x has the same
slope as ln x: (The real reason is that ln 3x D ln 3 C ln x:) The antiderivative of 3=x
is not ln 3x but 3 ln x; which is ln x3:
Before moving to integrals, here is a new method for derivatives: logarithmic
differentiation or LD. It applies to products and powers. The product and power

rules are always available, but sometimes there is an easier way.
  Main idea: The logarithm of a product p.x/ is a sum of logarithms. Switching to

ln p; the sum rule just adds up the derivatives. But there is a catch at the end, as you

see in the example.

EXAMPLE 4  Find dp=dx if p.x/ D xx     x  ¡  1:  Here  ln  p.x   /  D   x  ln  x  C  1  ln.x  ¡  1/:
                                                                                     2

Take the derivative of ln p:  1 dp D x ¤ 1 C ln x C 1 :
Now multiply by p.x/:         p dx               x               2.x ¡1/

                              dp  D p 1 C ln x C 1  :
                              dx                                 2.x ¡1/

The catch is that last step. Multiplying by p complicates the answer. This can't be
helped--logarithmic differentiation contains no magic. The derivative of p D fg is
the same as from the product rule: ln p D ln f C ln g gives

    p D C and p ½ f ½ g½ ½ D p C D f  f ½ g½  ½g C fg½: (7)
           pf g                           fg

For p D xex sin x; with three factors, the sum has three terms:

                                       ½ 1                 cos x 
    ln p D ln x C x C ln sin x and p D p C 1 C                             :
                                                    x            sin x

We multiply p times p½=p (the derivative of ln p). Do the same for powers:

EXAMPLE 5 p D x1=x     ln p D 1 ln x      dp  1 ln x 
                               x

                         INTEGRALS BASED ON LOGARITHMS

     Now comes an important step. Many integrals produce logarithms. The foremost
     example is 1=x; whose integral is ln x: In a certain way that is the only example,
     but its range is enormously extended by the chain rule. The derivative of ln u.x/ is

     u½=u; so the integral goes from u½=u back to ln u:

           ÷ du=dx       dx D ln u.x/ or equivalently  ÷ du  D ln u:

               u.x/                                    u

     Try to choose u.x/ so that the integral contains du=dx divided by u:

     EXAMPLES                   ÷ dx                   ÷ dx 1
                                   x C 7 D ln x C 7       cx C 7 D c ln cx C 7

     Final remark When u is negative, ln u cannot be the integral of 1=u: The logarithm

     is not defined when u 0: But the integral can go forward by switching to ¡u:

                         ÷ du=dx ÷ dx D ¡du=dx dx D ln.¡u/: (8)
                             u            ¡u

     Thus ln.¡u/ succeeds when ln u fails. The forbidden case is u D 0. The
     integrals ln u and ln.¡u/; on the plus and minus sides of zero, can be combined

     as ln u : Every integral that gives a logarithm allows u 0 by changing to the

       The ratio du=u leads to important integrals. When u D cos x or u D sin x; we are
     integrating the tangent and cotangent. When there is a possibility that u 0; write
     the integral as ln u :

        Now we report on the secant and cosecant. The integrals of 1= cos x and 1= sin x
     also surrender to an attack by logarithms--based on a crazy trick:

6.5 Separable Equations Including the Logistic Equation

This section begins with the integrals that solve two basic differential equations:

   dy D cy and dy D cy C s: (1)
   dt  dt

We already know the solutions. What we don't know is how to discover those
solutions, when a suggestion "try ect " has not been made. Many important
equations, including these, separate into a y-integral and a t -integral. The answer
comes directly from the two separate integrations. When a differential equation is
reduced that far--to integrals that we know or can look up--it is solved.

  One particular equation will be emphasized. The logistic equation describes the
speedup and slowdown of growth. Its solution is an S-curve, which starts slowly, rises
quickly, and levels off. (The 1990's are near the middle of the S, if the prediction is
correct for the world population.) S-curves are solutions to nonlinear equations, and
we will be solving our first nonlinear model. It is highly important in biology and all
life sciences.

       SEPARABLE EQUATIONS

The equations dy=dt D cy and dy=dt D cy C s (with constant source s) can be
solved by a direct method. The idea is to separate y from t :

dy D c dt and dy D c dt: (2)
y      y C .s=c/

All y's are on the left side. All t 's are on the right side (and c can be on either side).
This separation would not be possible for dy=dt D y C t:

  Equation (2) contains differentials. They suggest integrals. The t -integrals give ct
and the y-integrals give logarithms:

 ln y D ct C constant and ln y C s  D ct C constant: (3)
                                                  c

The constant is determined by the initial condition. At t D 0 we require y D y0;
and the right constant will make that happen:

        s                       s
ln y D ct C ln y0 and ln y C D ct C ln y0 C :                                        (4)
           c                   c

Then the final step isolates y: The goal is a formula for y itself, not its logarithm, so
take the exponential of both sides (eln y is y):

y D y0ect and y C s D y0 C e  s  ct : (5)
       c                    c

It is wise to substitute y back into the differential equation, as a check.

  This is our fourth method for y½ D cy C s: Method 1 assumed from the start that
y D Aect C B: Method 2 multiplied all inputs by their growth factors ec.t¡T / and

added up outputs. Method 3 solved for y ¡ y : Method 4 is separation of variables

(and all methods give the same answer). This separation method is so useful that we

repeat its main idea, and then explain it by using it.

                     Then substitute the initial condition to determine C; and solve for y.t/:

     EXAMPLE 1 dy=dt D y2 separates into dy=y2 D dt: Integrate to reach

     ¡1=y D t C C: Substitute t D 0 and y D y0 to find C D ¡1=y0: Now solve for y:

                                   ¡ 1 D t ¡ 1 and y D y0 :
                                      y           y0                         1 ¡ ty0

     This solution blows up (Figure 6.15a) when t reaches 1=y0: If the bank pays interest

     on your deposit squared (y½ D y2), you soon have all the money in the world.

     EXAMPLE 3 dy=dt D y C t is not separable. Method 1 survives by assuming
     y D Aet C B C Dt --with an extra coefficient D in Problem 23: Method 2 also

     succeeds--but not the separation method.

     EXAMPLE 4 Separate dy=dt D ny=t into dy=y D n dt =t: By integration ln y D
     n ln t C C: Substituting t D 0 produces ln 0 and disaster. This equation cannot start
     from time zero (it divides by t ). However y can start from y1 at t D 1; which gives
     C D ln y1: The solution is a power function y D y1t n.

       This was the first differential equation in the book (Section 2:2). The ratio of dy=y
     to dt =t is the "elasticity" in economics. These relative changes have units like
     dollars=dollars--they are dimensionless, and y D t n has constant elasticity n:

       On log-log paper the graph of ln y D n ln t C C is a straight line with slope n:

                                          THE LOGISTIC EQUATION

     The simplest model of population growth is dy=dt D cy: The growth rate c is the
     birth rate minus the death rate. If c is constant the growth goes on forever--beyond the
     point where the model is reasonable. A population can't grow all the way to infinity!
     Eventually there is competition for food and space, and y D ect must slow down.
6.5 Separable Equations Including the Logistic Equation                                    319

  The true rate c depends on the population size y: It is a function c.y/ not a
constant. The choice of the model is at least half the problem:

                 Problem in biology or ecology: Discover c.y/:

                 Problem in mathematics: Solve dy=dt D c.y/y:

Every model looks linear over a small range of y's--but not forever. When the rate
drops off, two models are of the greatest importance. The Michaelis-Menten equation

has c.y/ D c=.y C K/: The logistic equation has c.y/ D c ¡ by: It comes first.

  The nonlinear effect is from "interaction." For two populations of size y and z;
the number of interactions is proportional to y times z: The Law of Mass Action
produces a quadratic term byz: It is the basic model for interactions and
competition. Here we have one population competing within itself, so z is the same

as y: This competition slows down the growth, because ¡by2 goes into the equation.

The basic model of growth versus competition is known as the logistic equation:

             dy=dt D cy ¡ by2:                              (7)

Normally b is very small compared to c: The growth begins as usual (close to ect ).
The competition term by2 is much smaller than cy; until y itself gets large. Then
by2 (with its minus sign) slows the growth down. The solution follows an S-curve

that we can compute exactly.
  What are the numbers b and c for human population ? Ecologists estimate the

natural growth rate as c D :029=year. That is not the actual rate, because of b:
About 1930; the world population was 3 billion. The cy term predicts a yearly
increase of .:029/.3 billion/ D 87 million: The actual growth was more like
dy=dt D 60 million=year: That difference of 27 million=year was by2:

        27 million=year D b.3 billion/2 leads to b D 3 ¤ 10¡12=year:

Certainly b is a small number (three trillionths) but its effect is not small. It reduces
87 to 60: What is fascinating is to calculate the steady state, when the new term by2

equals the old term cy: When these terms cancel each other, dy=dt D cy ¡ by2 is

zero. The loss from competition balances the gain from new growth: cy D by2 and

y D c=b: The growth stops at this equilibrium point--the top of the S-curve:

             y D c D :0291012  10 billion people:
                    b3

According to Verhulst's logistic equation, the world population is converging to 10
billion. That is from the model. From present indications we are growing much faster.
We will very probably go beyond 10 billion. The United Nations report in Section 3:3
predicts 11 billion to 14 billion.

Notice a special point halfway to y D c=b. (In the model this point is at 5

billion.) It is the inflection point where the S-curve begins to bend down. The second
derivative d 2y=dt 2 is zero. The slope dy=dt is a maximum. It is easier to find this

point from the differential equation (which gives dy=dt ) than from y: Take one more

derivative:  y¾ D .cy ¡ by2/½ D cy½ ¡ 2byy½ D .c ¡ 2by/y½:

                                                            (8)

The factor c ¡ 2by is zero at the inflection point y D c=2b; halfway up the S-curve.

                                         THE S-CURVE

     The logistic equation is solved by separating variables y and t:

                                                    ÷                          ÷

                dy=dt D cy ¡ by2 becomes dy=.cy ¡ by2/ D dt:                                   (9)

     The first question is whether we recognize this y-integral. No. The second question is

     whether it is listed in the cover of the book. No. The nearest is dx=.a2 ¡ x2/; which

     can be reached with considerable manipulation (Problem 21). The third question is

     whether a general method is available. Yes. "Partial fractions" is perfectly suited to

     1=.cy ¡ by2/; and Section 7:4 gives the following integral of equation (9):

                ln y D ct C C and then ln y0 D C: (10)
                c ¡by                                              c ¡ by0

     That constant C makes the solution correct at t D 0: The logistic equation is

     integrated, but the solution can be improved. Take exponentials of both sides to

     remove the logarithms:
                                            y D ect y0 : (11)

                           c ¡ by c ¡ by0

     This contains the same growth factor ect as in linear equations. But the logistic

     equation is not linear--it is not y that increases so fast. According to (11), it is

     y=.c ¡ by/ that grows to infinity. This happens when c ¡ by approaches zero.

       The growth stops at y D c=b: That is the final population of the world (10 bil-

     lion ? ).

     We still need a formula for y: The perfect S-curve is the graph of y D 1=.1 C
     e¡t /: It equals 1 when t D                 1                                         D¡
                                  ;  it  equals  2  when  t  D 0;  it  equals  0  when  t      : It
     satisfies y½ D y ¡ y2; with c D b D 1: The general formula cannot be so beautiful,

     because it allows any c; b; and y0: To find the S-curve, multiply equation (11) by
     c ¡ by and solve for y: c
                                                                       c
                y D b C e¡ct c ¡ by0=y0 or y D b C de¡ct : (12)
     When t approaches infinity, e¡ct approaches zero. The complicated part of the

     formula disappears. Then y approaches its steady state c=b; the asymptote in

     Figure 6.16. The S-shape comes from the inflection point halfway up.

      Remark For good science the y2 term should be explained and justified. It gave
      a nonlinear model that could be completely solved, but simplicity is not necessar-
      ily truth. The basic justification is this: In a population of size y; the number of

      encounters is proportional to y2: If those encounters are fights, the term is ¡by2: If

      those encounters increase the population, as some like to think, the sign is changed.
      There is a cooperation term Cby2; and the population increases very fast.

      EXAMPLE 5 y½ D cy C by2: y goes to infinity in a finite time.

      EXAMPLE 6 y½ D ¡dy C by2: y dies to zero if y0 d=b:

      In Example 6 death wins. A small population dies out before the cooperation by2
      can save it. A population below d=b is an endangered species.

        The logistic equation can't predict oscillations--those go beyond dy=dt D f .y/:

      The y line Here is a way to understand every nonlinear equation y½ D f .y/: Draw
      a "y line." Add arrows to show the sign of f .y/: When y½ D f .y/ is positive, y is

      increasing (it follows the arrow to the right). When f is negative, y goes to the left.

      When f is zero, the equation is y½ D 0 and y is stationary:

      The arrows take you left or right, to the steady state or to infinity. Arrows go toward
      stable steady states. The arrows go away, when the stationary point is unstable. The
      y line shows which way y moves and where it stops.

       Immigration does not enter for the world population model (at least not yet).

       The terminal velocity of a falling body is v D g in Problem 6:7:54: For

     EXAMPLE 7 Kinetics of a chemical reaction mA C nB pC:

       The reaction combines m molecules of A with n molecules of B to produce p
     molecules of C: The numbers m; n; p are 1; 1; 2 for hydrogen chloride: H2 C Cl2 D
     2 HCl: The Law of Mass Action says that the reaction rate is proportional to the
     product of the concentrations OEA and OEB: Then OEA decays as OEC  grows:

     d OEA=dt D ¡rOEAOEB and d OEC =dt D CkOEAOEB:          (15)

     Chemistry measures r and k: Mathematics solves for OEA and OEC : Write y for the
     concentration OEC ; the number of molecules in a unit volume. Forming those y

     molecules drops the concentration OEA from a0 to a0 ¡ .m=p/y: Similarly OEB drops

     This fits our nonlinear model (Problem 33 ¡ 34). We now find this same mass action

     in biology. You recognize it whenever there is a product of two concentrations.

     Biochemical reactions are the keys to life. They take place continually in every living
     organism. Their mathematical description is not easy! Engineering and physics go far

     with linear models, while biology is quickly nonlinear. It is true that y½ D cy is ex-

     tremely effective in first-order kinetics (Section 6:3), but nature builds in a nonlinear
     regulator.

       It is enzymes that speed up a reaction. Without them, your life would be in slow
     motion. Blood would take years to clot. Steaks would take decades to digest. Calculus
     would take centuries to learn. The whole system is awesomely beautiful--DNA tells
     amino acids how to combine into useful proteins, and we get enzymes and elephants
     and Isaac Newton.

       Briefly, the enzyme enters the reaction and comes out again. It is the catalyst. Its
     combination with the substrate is an unstable intermediate, which breaks up into a
     new product and the enzyme (which is ready to start over).

       Here are examples of catalysts, some good and some bad.

        1. The platinum in a catalytic converter reacts with pollutants from the car engine.
            (But platinum also reacts with lead--ten gallons of leaded gasoline and you can
            forget the platinum.)

        2. Spray propellants (CFC's) catalyze the change from ozone (O3) into ordinary
            oxygen (O2). This wipes out the ozone layer--our shield in the atmosphere.

        3. Milk becomes yoghurt and grape juice becomes wine.

4. Blood clotting needs a whole cascade of enzymes, amplifying the reaction at
   every step. In hemophilia--the "Czar's disease"--the enzyme called Factor VIII
   is missing. A small accident is disaster; the bleeding won't stop.

5. Adolph's Meat Tenderizer is a protein from papayas. It predigests the steak.
   The same enzyme (chymopapain) is injected to soften herniated disks.

6. Yeast makes bread rise. Enzymes put the sour in sourdough.

Of course, it takes enzymes to make enzymes. The maternal egg contains the material
for a cell, and also half of the DNA. The fertilized egg contains the full instructions.

  We now look at the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation, to describe these reactions.
It is based on the Law of Mass Action. An enzyme in concentration z converts a

substrate in concentration y by dy=dt D ¡byz: The rate constant is b; and you see

the product of "enzyme times substrate." A similar law governs the other reactions

(some go backwards). The equations are nonlinear, with no exact solution. It is typical

of applied mathematics (and nature) that a pattern can still be found.
  What happens is that the enzyme concentration z.t / quickly drops to z0K=.y C

K/: The Michaelis constant K depends on the rates (like b) in the mass action laws.
Later the enzyme reappears (z D z0). But by then the first reaction is over. Its law
of mass action is effectively

dy D ¡byz D ¡ cy (17)
dt  yCK

with c D bz0K: This is the Michaelis-Menten equation--basic to biochemistry.
  The rate dy=dt is all-important in biology. Look at the function cy=.y C K/:

    when y is large; dy=dt ¡c when y is small; dy=dt ¡cy=K:

The start and the finish operate at different rates, depending whether y dominates K
or K dominates y: The fastest rate is c:

  A biochemist solves the MM equation by separating variables:

              ÷ yCK ÷

            y dy D ¡ c dt gives y C K ln y D ¡ct C C: (18)

Set t D 0 as usual. Then C D y0 C K ln y0: The exponentials of the two sides are

ey yK D e¡ct ey0 yK0 :                                   (19)

We don't have a simple formula for y: We are lucky to get this close. A computer
can quickly graph y.t /--and we see the dynamics of enzymes.

 Problems 27 ¡ 32 follow up the Michaelis-Menten theory. In science, concentra-

tions and rate constants come with units. In mathematics, variables can be made
dimensionless and constants become 1: We solve d Y =d T D Y =.Y C 1/ and then
switch back to y; t; c; K: This idea applies to other equations too.

  Essential point: Most applications of calculus come through differential
equations. That is the language of mathematics--with populations and chemicals
and epidemics obeying the same equation. Running parallel to dy=dt D cy are the
difference equations that come next.

326                       6 Exponentials and Logarithms

              6.6 Powers Instead of Exponentials

     You may remember our first look at e. It is the special base for which ex has slope
     1 at x D 0. That led to the great equation of exponential growth: The derivative of
     ex equals ex. But our look at the actual number e D 2:71828 : : : was very short.
     It appeared as the limit of .1 C 1=n/n. This seems an unnatural way to write down

     such an important number.
       I want to show how .1 C 1=n/n and .1 C x=n/n arise naturally. They give dis-

     crete growth in finite steps--with applications to compound interest. Loans and life

     insurance and money market funds use the discrete form of y½ D cy C s. (We

     include extra information about bank rates, hoping this may be useful some day.) The

     applications in science and engineering are equally important. Scientific computing,

     like accounting, has difference equations in parallel with differential equations.

       Knowing that this section will be full of formulas, I would like to jump ahead and
     tell you the best one. It is an infinite series for ex. What makes the series beautiful is

     that its derivative is itself.

       Start with y D 1 C x. This has y D 1 and y½ D 1 at x D 0. But y¾ is zero, not one.

     Such a simple function doesn't stand a chance! No polynomial can be its own deriva-

     tive, because the highest power xn drops down to nxn¡1. The only way is to have no

     highest power. We are forced to consider infinitely many terms--a power series--to

     achieve "derivative equals function."
       To produce the derivative 1 C x; we need 1 C x C 12 x2: Then 12 x2 is the

     derivative of 16 x3; which is the derivative of 124 x4: The best way is to write
     the whole series at once:

              Infinite series ex D 1 C x C 12 x2 C 16 x3 C 124 x4 C ¤ ¤ ¤ :                                      (1)

     This must be the greatest power series ever discovered. Its derivative is itself:

              d     ex  =d   x  D  0  C  1  C  x  C  1  x  2  C  1  x  3  C  ¤  ¤  ¤  D  ex  :                   (2)
                                                     2           6

     The derivative of each term is the term before it. The integral of each term is the one

     after it (so exdx D ex C C ). The approximation ex 1 C x appears in the first two

     terms. Other properties like .ex/.ex/ D e2x are not so obvious. (Multiplying series

     is hard but interesting.) It is not even clear why the sum is 2:718 : : : when x D 1.
                    1     1  C¤¤¤
     Somehow  1C1C  2  C  6        equals      e:  That    is  where      .1 C 1=n/n            will  come  in.
     Notice that xn is divided by the product 1 ¤ 2 ¤ 3 ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ n: This is "n factorial." Thus
     x4 is divided by 1 ¤ 2 ¤ 3 ¤ 4 D 4S D 24; and x5 is divided by 5S D 120: The derivative
     of x5=120 is x4=24; because 5 from the derivative cancels 5 from the factorial. In
     general xn=nS has derivative xn¡1=.n ¡ 1/S Surprisingly 0S is 1:

          Chapter 10 emphasizes that xn=nS becomes extremely small as n increases. The
     infinite series adds up to a finite number--which is ex: We turn now to discrete

     growth, which produces the same series in the limit.

                   213 Years After Loan, Uncle Sam is Dunned

     San Antonio, May 26--More than 200 years ago, a wealthy Pennsylvania
     merchant named Jacob DeHaven lent $450; 000 to the Continental Congress to
     rescue the troops at Valley Forge. That loan was apparently never repaid.
                        6.6 Powers Instead of Exponentials                              327

  So Mr. DeHaven's descendants are taking the United States Government to
court to collect what they believe they are owed. The total: $141 billion if the
interest is compounded daily at 6 percent, the going rate at the time. If compounded
yearly, the bill is only $98 billion.

  The thousands of family members scattered around the country say they are
not being greedy. "It's not the money--it's the principle of the thing," said
Carolyn Cokerham, a DeHaven on her father's side who lives in San Antonio.
"You have to wonder whether there would even be a United States if this man had
not made the sacrifice that he did. He gave everything he had."

  The descendants say that they are willing to be flexible about the amount of
settlement. But they also note that interest is accumulating at $190 a second.

  "None of these people have any intention of bankrupting the Government,"
said Jo Beth Kloecker, a lawyer from Stafford, Texas. Fresh out of law school,
Ms. Kloecker accepted the case for less than the customary 30 percent contingency.

  It is unclear how many descendants there are. Ms. Kloecker estimates that based
on 10 generations with four children in each generation, there could be as many as
half a million.

  The initial suit was dismissed on the ground that the statute of limitations is
six years for a suit against the Federal Government. The family's appeal asserts
that this violates Article 6 of the Constitution, which declares as valid all debts
owed by the Government before the Constitution was adopted.

  Mr. DeHaven died penniless in 1812: He had no children.

                                      COMPOUND INTEREST

The idea of compound interest can be applied right away. Suppose you invest
$1000 at a rate of 100% (hard to do). If this is the annual rate, the interest after a
year is another $1000: You receive $2000 in all. But if the interest is compounded
you receive more:

         after six months: Interest of $500 is reinvested to give $1500
         end of year: New interest of $750 (50% of 1500) gives $2250 total.

The bank multiplied twice by 1:5 (1000 to 1500 to 2250). Compounding quarterly
multiplies four times by 1:25 (1 for principal, :25 for interest):

                  after one quarter the total is 1000 C .:25/.1000/D 1250
                 after two quarters the total is 1250 C .:25/.1250/D 1562:50
         after nine months the total is 1562:50 C .:25/.1562:50/D 1953:12
            after a full year the total is 1953:12 C .:25/.1953:12/D 2441:41

Each step multiplies by 1 C .1=n/; to add one nth of a year's interest--still at 100%:

          quarterly conversion: .1 C 1=4/4 ¢ 1000 D 2441:41

          daily conversion: .1 C 1=365/365 ¢ 1000 D 2714:57:

Many banks use 360 days in a year, although computers have made that obsolete.
Very few banks use minutes (525; 600 per year). Nobody compounds every second

     As 1=n gets smaller, this approximation gets better. The limit is 1: Conclusion:
     .1 C 1=n/n approaches the number whose logarithm is 1: Sections 6:2 and 6:4

     define the same number (which is e).

     2. Slow method for .1 C 1=n/n: Multiply out all the terms. Then let n .

     Those nine terms give an accuracy that was not reached by n D 365 compoundings.
     A limit is still involved (to add up the whole series). You never see e without a
     limit! It can be defined by derivatives or integrals or powers .1 C 1=n/n or by an

     infinite series. Something goes to zero or infinity, and care is required.

       All terms in equation (4) are below (or equal to) the corresponding terms in (5).
     The power .1 C 1=n/n approaches e from below. There is a steady increase with n:
     Faster compounding yields more interest. Continuous compounding at 100% yields
     e; as each term in (4) moves up to its limit in (5).

The logarithm of that power is n ln.1 C x=n/ n.x=n/ D x: The power approaches ex:
  To summarize: The quick method proves .1 C 1=n/n e by logarithms. The slow

method (multiplying out every term) led to the infinite series. Together they show the
agreement of all our definitions of e:

             DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS VS. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

We have the chance to see an important part of applied mathematics. This is not
a course on differential equations, and it cannot become a course on difference
equations. But it is a course with a purpose--we aim to use what we know. Our

main application of e was to solve y½ D cy and y½ D cy C s: Now we solve the

corresponding difference equations.
  Above all, the goal is to see the connections. The purpose of mathematics is to

understand and explain patterns. The path from "discrete to continuous" is beauti-
fully illustrated by these equations. Not every class will pursue them to the end, but I
cannot fail to show the pattern in a difference equation:

y.t C 1/ D ay.t/:                                                              (7)

Each step multiplies by the same number a: The starting value y0 is followed by
ay0, a2y0, and a3y0: The solution at discrete times t D 0; 1; 2; : : : is y.t / D aty0:

  This formula aty0 replaces the continuous solution ecty0 of the differential

equation.

A source or sink (birth or death, deposit or withdrawal) is like y½ D cy C s:

y.t C 1/ D ay.t/ C s:                                                          (8)

Each step multiplies by a and adds s: The first outputs are
     y.1/ D ay0 C s; y.2/ D a2y0 C as C s; y.3/ D a3y0 C a2s C as C s:

We saw this pattern for differential equations--every input s becomes a new start-
ing point. It is multiplied by powers of a: Since s enters later than y0; the powers

     EXAMPLE 1 Interest at 8% from annual IRA deposits of s D $2000 (here y0 D 0).

     The first deposit is at year t D 1: In a year it is multiplied by a D 1:08; because 8%

     is added. At the same time a new s D 2000 goes in. At t D 3 the first deposit has

     been multiplied by .1:08/2; the second by 1:08; and there is another s D 2000: After

     With t D 1 this is 2000: With t D 2 it is 2000 .1:08 C 1/--two deposits. Notice how

     a ¡ 1 (the interest rate :08) appears in the denominator.

     EXAMPLE 2 Approach to steady state when a 1: Compare with c 0:

     With a 1; everything has been increasing. That corresponds to c 0 in the

     differential equation (which is growth). But things die, and money is spent, so a

     can be smaller than one. In that case at y0 approaches zero--the starting balance

     disappears. What happens if there is also a source ? Every year half of the balance
                                                                            1

     The limit as t             is an equilibrium point. As 21 t goes to zero, y.t / stabilizes to

     Why is 4000 steady ? Because half is lost and the new 2000 makes it up again. The

     EXAMPLE 3 Demand equals supply when the price is right.

     Difference equations are basic to economics. Decisions are made every year (by a
     farmer) or every day (by a bank) or every minute (by the stock market). There are
     three assumptions:

     1. Supply next time depends on price this time: S.t C 1/ D cP .t /:

     2. Demand next time depends on price next time: D.t C 1/ D ¡dP .t C 1/ C b:

     3. Demand next time equals supply next time: D.t C 1/ D S.t C 1/:

     Comment on 3: the price sets itself to make demand D supply. The demand slope

     ¡d is negative. The supply slope c is positive. Those lines intersect at the competitive

     price, where supply equals demand. To find the difference equation, substitute 1 and

     2 into 3:

             Difference equation W ¡dP .t C 1/ C b D cP .t/
                                                  ¡dP C b D cP : Thus P D b=.c C d /:
             Steady state price W

     If the price starts above P ; the difference equation brings it down. If below, the
     price goes up. When the price is P ; it stays there. This is not news--economic

theory depends on approach to a steady state. But convergence only occurs if c d:

If supply is less sensitive than demand, the economy is stable.

 Blow-up example: c D 2, b D d D 1: The difference equation is ¡P .t C 1/ C 1 D
2P .t/: From P .0/ D 1 the price oscillates as it grows: P D ¡1; 3; ¡5; 11; : : ::

  Stable example: c D 1=2, b D d D 1: The price moves from P .0/ D 1 to

P . / D 2=3:

   ¡P .t C 1/ C 1 D 1 P .t/ yields P D 1; 1 ; 3 ; 5 ; : : :; approaching 2 :
                           2                 248                         3

Increasing d gives greater stability. That is the effect of price supports. For d D 0
(fixed demand regardless of price) the economy is out of control.

                           THE MATHEMATICS OF FINANCE

It would be a pleasure to make this supply-demand model more realistic--with curves,
not straight lines. Stability depends on the slope--calculus enters. But we
also have to be realistic about class time. I believe the most practical application is
to solve the fundamental problems of finance. Section 6.3 answered six questions
about continuous interest. We now answer the same six questions when the annual
rate is x D :05 D 5% and interest is compounded n times a year.

  First we compute effective rates, higher than :05 because of compounding:

                            :05 4            h                                i

   compounded quarterly 1 C    4   D 1:0509     effective rate :0509 D 5:09%

   compounded continuously e:05 D 1:0513     h                        i

                                                effective rate 5:13%

Now come the six questions. Next to the new answer (discrete) we write the old
answer (continuous). One is algebra, the other is calculus. The time period is 20
years, so simple interest on y0 would produce .:05/.20/.y0/: That equals y0--money
doubles in 20 years at 5% simple interest.

  Questions 1 and 2 ask for the future value y and present value y0 with compound
interest n times a year:

1: y growing from y0W                :05 20n       y D e.:05/.20/y0
2: deposit y0 to reach yW      y D 1 C n y0
                                                  y0 D e¡.:05/.20/y
                                    :05 ¡20n

                              y0 D 1 C n y

Each step multiplies by a D .1 C :05=n/: There are 20n steps in 20 years. Time goes

backward in Question 2. We divide by the growth factor instead of multiplying. The

future value is greater than the present value (unless the interest rate is negative!). As

n  the discrete y on the left approaches the continuous y on the right.

  Questions 3 and 4 connect y to s (with y0 D 0 at the start). As soon as each s is

deposited, it starts growing. Then y D s C as C a2s C ¤ ¤ ¤ :

332  6 Exponentials and Logarithms

     Questions 5 and 6 connect y0 to s: This time y is zero--there is nothing left at the
     end. Everything is paid. The deposit y0 is just enough to allow payments of s: This
     is an annuity, where the bank earns interest on your y0 while it pays you s (n times
     a year for 20 years). So your deposit in Question 5 is less than 20ns:

       Question 6 is the opposite--a loan. At the start you borrow y0 (instead of giving
     the bank y0). You can earn interest on it as you pay it back. Therefore your payments
     have to total more than y0: This is the calculation for car loans and mortgages.

     6: Loan: Repay y0 with 20n payments of s:

     Questions 2; 4; 6 are the inverses of 1; 3; 5: Notice the pattern: There are three
     numbers y; y0; and s: One of them is zero each time. If all three are present, go
     back to equation (9).

       The algebra for these lines is in the exercises. It is not calculus because t is not
     dt . All factors in brackets   are listed in tables, and the banks keep copies. It

     might also be helpful to know their symbols. If a bank has interest rate i per period
     over N periods, then in our notation a D 1 C i D 1 C :05=n and t D N D 20n:

     future value of y0 D $1 .line 1/ W y.N / D .1 C i/N

     present value of y D $1 .line 2/ W y0 D .1 C i /¡N

     future value of s D $1 .line 3/ W y.N / D sN ×i D .1 C i /N ¡ 1 = ihi

     present value of s D $1 .line 5/ W y0 D aN ×i D 1 ¡ .1 C i /¡N = ihi

     To tell the truth, I never knew the last two formulas until writing this book.
     The mortgage on my home has N D .12/.25/ monthly payments with interest rate
     i D :07=12: In 1972 the present value was $42; 000 D amount borrowed. I am now
     going to see if the bank is honest.

     Remark In many loans, the bank computes interest on the amount paid back
     instead of the amount received. This is called discounting. A loan of $1000 at 5%
     for one year costs $50 interest. Normally you receive $1000 and pay back $1050:
     With discounting you receive $950 (called the proceeds) and you pay back $1000:
     The true interest rate is higher than 5%--because the $50 interest is paid on the
     smaller amount $950: In this case the "discount rate" is 50=950 D 5:26%:

                                          DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS

     In biology and business, most events are discrete. In engineering and physics, time
     and space are continuous. Maybe at some quantum level it's all the same, but the

      It's not. s is too big. I knew it.

equations of physics (starting with Newton's law F D ma) are differential equations.
The great contribution of calculus is to model the rates of change we see in nature.
But to solve that model with a computer, it needs to be made digital and discrete.

  These paragraphs work with dy=dt D cy: It is the test equation that all analysts
use, as soon as a new computing method is proposed. Its solution is y D ect ; starting
from y0 D 1: Here we test Euler's method (nearly ancient, and not well thought of).
He replaced dy=dt by y=t :

            Euler's Method y.t C t/ ¡ y.t/ D cy.t/: (13)

                                                      t

The left side is dy=dt; in the limit t 0: We stop earlier, when t 0:
  The problem is to solve (13). Multiplying by t; the equation is

y.t C t/ D .1 C ct/y.t/ .with y.0/ D 1/:

Each step multiplies by a D 1 C ct; so n steps multiply by an:

                y D an D .1 C ct /n at time nt:                             (14)

This is growth or decay, depending on a: The correct ect is growth or decay,
depending on c: The question is whether an and ect stay close. Can one of them

grow while the other decays ? We expect the difference equation to copy y½ D cy;

but we might be wrong.

 A good example is y½ D ¡y: Then c D ¡1 and y D e¡t --the true solution decays.

The calculator gives the following answers an for n D 2; 10; 20:

t a D 1 Cct a2                  a10              a20

3               ¡2   4          1024  1048576

1=10            :90  :81

1=20            :95  :90

The big step t D 3 shows total instability (top row). The numbers blow up when
they should decay. The row with t D 1 is equally useless (all zeros). In practice the
magnitude of ct must come down to .10 or .05: For accurate calculations it would
have to be even smaller, unless we change to a better difference equation. That is the

right thing to do.

  Notice the two reasonable numbers. They are :35 and :36; approaching e¡1 D :37:

They come from n D 10 (with t D 1=10) and n D 20 (with t D 1=20). Those
have the same clock time nt D 1:

1 ¡ 1 10 D :35  1 ¡ 1 20 D :36       1 ¡ 1 n                    e¡1 D :37:

       10              20                   n

The main diagonal of the table is executing .1 C x=n/n ex in the case x D ¡1:

  Final question: How quickly are :35 and :36 converging to e¡1 D :37 ? With

t D :10 the error is :02: With t D :05 the error is :01: Cutting the time step
in half cuts the error in half. We are not keeping enough digits to be sure, but the
334                                     6 Exponentials and Logarithms

     error seems close to 15 t: To test that, apply the "quick method" and estimate

     an D .1 ¡ t /n from its logarithm:

                            n h 1 2i 1

           ln.1 ¡ t/ D n ln.1 ¡ t/ n ¡t ¡ 2 t D ¡1 ¡ 2t: (15)

     The clock time is nt D 1: Now take exponentials of the far left and right:

                                        an D .1 ¡ t /n e¡1e¡t=2 e¡1 1 ¡ 12 t : (16)

     The                    difference  between  an  and  e¡1  is  the  last  term  1  t e¡1:    Everything  comes  down
                                                                                    2
     to one question: Is that error the same as 15 t ? The answer is yes, because e¡1=2
     is 1=5: If we keep only one digit, the prediction is perfect!

     That took an hour to work out, and I hope it takes longer than t to read. I wanted
     you to see in use the properties of ln x and ex: The exact property ln an D n ln a

     came first. In the middle of (15) was the key approximation ln.1 C x/ x ¡ 12 x2;
     with x D ¡t: That x2 term uses the second derivative (Section 6.4). At the very

     end came ex 1 C x:
       A linear approximation shows convergence: .1 C x=n/n ex: A quadratic shows

     the error: proportional to t D 1=n: It is like using rectangles for areas, with error

     proportional to x: This minimal accuracy was enough to define the integral, and

     here it is enough to define e: It is completely unacceptable for scientific computing.

       The trapezoidal rule, for integrals or for y½ D cy; has errors of order .x/2 and

     .t /2: All good software goes further than that. Euler's first-order method could not

     predict the weather before it happens.

                           6.7 Hyperbolic Functions

     This section combines ex with e¡x. Up to now those functions have gone separate

     ways--one increasing, the other decreasing. But two particular combinations have
     earned names of their own (cosh x and sinh x):

                                   ex C e¡x               hyperbolic sine sinh x D ex ¡ e¡x

     hyperbolic cosine cosh x D                                                               2
                                            2

     The first name rhymes with "gosh". The second is usually pronounced "cinch".
       The graphs in Figure 6.18 show that cosh x sinh x. For large x both hyperbolic

     functions come extremely close to 12 ex. When x is large and negative, it is e¡x that

     dominates. Cosh x still goes up to C while sinh x goes down to ¡ (because

     sinh x has a minus sign in front of e¡x).

                                    2           2

     The following facts come directly from        1      ex C e¡x and  1  ex ¡ e¡x:
                                                   2                    2

     cosh.¡x/ D cosh x and cosh 0 D 1 .cosh is even like the cosine/
     sinh.¡x/ D ¡ sinh x and sinh 0 D 0 .sinh is odd like the sine/

     The graph of cosh x corresponds to a hanging cable (hanging under its weight).
     Turned upside down, it has the shape of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. That must
     be the largest upside-down cosh function ever built. A cable is easier to construct
     than an arch, because gravity does the work. With the right axes in Problem 55; the
     height of the cable is a stretched-out cosh function called a catenary:

                y D a cosh .x=a/ .cable tension=cable density D a/:

     Busch Stadium in St. Louis has 96 catenary curves, to match the Arch.

       The properties of the hyperbolic functions come directly from the definitions.
     There are too many properties to memorize--and no reason to do it! One rule is the
     most important. Every fact about sines and cosines is reflected in a correspond-
     ing fact about sinh x and cosh x: Often the only difference is a minus sign. Here
     are four properties:

Fig. 6.20 The unit circle cos2t C sin2t D 1 and the unit hyperbola cosh2t ¡ sinh2t D 1:

Property 1 is the connection to hyperbolas. It is responsible for the "h" in cosh
and sinh : Remember that .cos x/2 C .sin x/2 D 1 puts the point .cos x; sin x/

onto a unit circle. As x varies, the point goes around the circle. The ordinary sine

and cosine are "circular functions." Now look at .cosh x; sinh x/: Property 1 is

.cosh x/2 ¡ .sinh x/2 D 1, so this point travels on the unit hyperbola in Figure 6.20.

  You will guess the definitions of the other four hyperbolic functions:

properties come directly from cosh2x ¡ sinh2x D 1: Divide by cosh2x and sinh2x:

                             INVERSE HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS

You remember the angles sin¡1x and tan¡1x and sec¡1x: In Section 4.4 we

differentiated those inverse functions by the chain rule. The main application was

to integrals. If we happen to meet dx=.1 C x2/; it is tan¡1x C C: The situation for
338                           6 Exponentials and Logarithms

     sinh¡1x and tanh¡1x and sech¡1x is the same except for sign changes--which are

     expected for hyperbolic functions. We write down the three new derivatives:

                y D sinh¡1x .meaning x D sinh y/ has dy D 1 (1)

                                                                    dx x2 C1

             y D tanh¡1x .meaning x D tanh y/ has dy dx D 1 ¡ x2 1 (2)
             y D sech¡1x .meaning x D sech y/ has dy D ¡1 (3)

                                            dx x 1¡x2
     Problems 44 ¡ 46 compute dy=dx from 1=.dx=dy/: The alternative is to use

     logarithms. Since ln x is the inverse of ex; we can express sinh¡1x and tanh¡1x
     and sech¡1x as logarithms. Here is y D tanh¡1x:

                      1 1Cx                         dy 1 1 1 1                                  1
                y D ln                  has slope D                           ¡     D              2:        (4)

     The  last  step  is  an  ordinary  derivative  of  1  ln  .  1  C  x  /  ¡  1  ln.1 ¡ x/:  Nothing  is  new
                                                        2                        2
     except the answer. But where did the logarithms come from ? In the middle of the

     following identity, multiply above and below by cosh y:

                      1 C x 1 C tanh y cosh y C sinh y ey 2y
                              D             D                                    D ¡y D e :
                      1 ¡ x 1 ¡ tanh y cosh y ¡ sinh y e

     Then 2y is the logarithm of the left side. This is the first equation in (4), and it is the
     third formula in the following list:

                sinh¡1x D ln x C x2 C 1 h i                cosh¡1x D ln x C h                     i

                tanh¡1x D 1 ln 1 C x                       sech¡1x D ln 1 C                1 ¡ x2 #

                        2 1¡x                                                              x

     Remark 1 Those are listed only for reference. If possible do not memorize them.
     The derivatives in equations (1), (2), (3) offer a choice of antiderivatives--either
     inverse functions or logarithms (most tables prefer logarithms). The inside cover of
     the book has

                 ÷ dx 1 1Cx                                (in place of tanh¡1x C C /:

                  1 ¡ x2 D 2 ln 1 ¡ x C C

     Remark 2 Logarithms were not seen for sin¡1x and tan¡1x and sec¡1x: You
     might wonder why. How does it happen that tanh¡1x is expressed by logarithms,
     when the parallel formula for tan¡1x was missing ? Answer: There must be a

     parallel formula. To display it I have to reveal a secret that has been hidden

     throughout this section.

     The secret is one of the great equations of mathematics. What formulas for
                                            1  ex C e¡x                       1  ex ¡ e¡x
     cos x  and  sin x    correspond    to  2                        and      2              ?  With so many

     analogies (circular vs. hyperbolic) you would expect to find something. The

     formulas do exist, but they involve imaginary numbers. Fortunately they are very
                                                       6.7 Hyperbolic Functions                                                               339

                      simple and there is no reason to withhold the truth any longer:

                            cos x D 1 eix C e¡ix and sin x D 1 eix ¡ e¡ix: (5)
                                         2                                           2i

                      It is the imaginary exponents that kept those identities hidden. Multiplying sin x by
                      i and adding to cos x gives Euler's unbelievably beautiful equation

                                                       cos x C i sin x D eix:                                             (6)

                      That is parallel to the non-beautiful hyperbolic equation cosh x C sinh x D ex:
                        I have to say that (6) is infinitely more important than anything hyperbolic will

                      ever be. The sine and cosine are far more useful than the sinh and cosh : So we end
                      our record of the main properties, with exercises to bring out their applications.

                       CHAPTER 7

Techniques of Integration

Chapter 5 introduced the integral as a limit of sums. The calculation of areas was

started--by hand or computer. Chapter 6 opened a different door. Its new functions
ex and ln x led to differential equations. You might say that all along we have been
solving the special differential equation df =dx D v.x/. The solution is f D v.x/ dx.
But the step to dy=dx D cy was a breakthrough.

  The truth is that we are able to do remarkable things. Mathematics has a lan-
guage, and you are learning to speak it. A short time ago the symbols dy=dx and

  v.x/ dx were a mystery. (My own class was not too sure about v.x/ itself--the

symbol for a function.) It is easy to forget how far we have come, in looking ahead to

what is next.

I do want to look ahead. For integrals there are two steps to take--more functions

and more applications. By using mathematics we make it live. The applications are

most complete when we know the integral. This short chapter will widen (very much)

the range of functions we can integrate. A computer with symbolic algebra widens it

more.
  Up to now, integration depended on recognizing derivatives. If v.x/ D sec2 x then

f .x/ D tan x. To integrate tan x we use a substitution:

÷ sin x  ÷ du
cos x dx D ¡ u D ¡ ln u D ¡ ln cos x:

What we need now are techniques for other integrals, to change them around until

we can attack them. Two examples are x cos x dx and 1 ¡ x2 dx, which are

not immediately recognizable. With integration by parts, and a new substitution, they

become simple.

  Those examples indicate where this chapter starts and stops. With reasonable

effort (and the help of tables, which is fair) you can integrate important functions.

With intense effort you could integrate even more functions. In older books that

extra exertion was made--it tended to dominate the course. They had integrals like

 .x C 1/ dx= 2x2 ¡ 6x C 4, which we could work on if we had to. Our time is

too valuable for that! Like long division, the ideas are for us and their intricate

elaboration is for the computer.

  Integration by parts comes first. Then we do new substitutions. Partial fractions

is a useful idea (already applied to the logistic equation y½ D cy ¡ by2/. In the last

section x goes to infinity or y.x/ goes to infinity--but the area stays finite. These
improper integrals are quite common. Chapter 8 brings the applications.

                                                                                        341
342        7 Techniques of Integration

           7.1 Integration by Parts

     There are two major ways to manipulate integrals (with the hope of making them
     easier). Substitutions are based on the chain rule, and more are ahead. Here we present
     the other method, based on the product rule. The reverse of the product rule, to find
     integrals not derivatives, is integration by parts.

       We have mentioned cos2 x dx and ln x dx. Now is the right time to compute

     them (plus more examples). You will see how ln x dx is exchanged for 1 dx--
     a definite improvement. Also xex dx is exchanged for ex dx. The difference
     between the harder integral and the easier integral is a known term--that is the point.

       One note before starting: Integration by parts is not just a trick with no meaning.
     On the contrary, it expresses basic physical laws of equilibrium and force balance.
     It is a foundation for the theory of differential equations (and even delta functions).
     The final paragraphs, which are completely optional, illustrate those points too.

     We begin with the product rule for the derivative of u.x/ times v.x/:

        u.x/ dv C v.x/ du D d .u.x/v.x//: (1)
           dx                           dx dx

     Integrate both sides. On the right, integration brings back u.x/v.x/. On the left are

     two integrals, and one of them moves to the other side (with a minus sign):

        ÷ dv                                   ÷ du
        u.x/ dx dx D u.x/v.x/ ¡ v.x/ dx dx: (2)

     That is the key to this section--not too impressive at first, but very powerful. It is
     integration by parts (u and v are the parts). In practice we write it without x's:

     7A The integration by parts formula is u dv D uv ¡ v du:                     (3)

     The problem of integrating u dv=dx is changed into the problem of integrating
     v du=dx. There is a minus sign to remember, and there is the "integrated term"
     u.x/v.x/. In the definite integral, that product u.x/v.x/ is evaluated at the end-
     points a and b:

     ÷ b u dv ÷ b dx D u.b/v.b/ ¡ u.a/v.a/ ¡ v du dx: (4)
     a dx                                                       a dx

     The key is in choosing u and v. The goal of that choice is to make v du easier
     than u dv. This is best seen by examples.

     EXAMPLE 1 For ln x dx choose u D ln x and dv D dx (so v D x):

     ÷                               ÷         ÷1

        ln x dx D uv ¡ v du D x ln x ¡ x x dx:

     I used the basic formula (3). Instead of working with ln x (searching for an

     antiderivative), we now work with the right hand side. There x times 1=x is 1. The

     integral of 1 is x. Including the minus sign and the integrated term uv D x ln x and

     the constant C , the answer is

                                     ln x dx D x ln x ¡ x C C:                    (5)

     For safety, take the derivative. The product rule gives ln x C x.1=x/ ¡ 1, which is
     ln x. The area under y D ln x from 2 to 3 is 3 ln 3 ¡ 3 ¡ 2 ln 2 C 2.
                        7.1 Integration by Parts                                                            343

To repeat: We exchanged the integral of ln x for the integral of 1.

EXAMPLE 2     For x cos x dx choose u D x and dv D cos x dx (so v.x/ D sin x):

              x cos x dx D uv ¡ v du D x sin x ¡ sin x dx:                                         (6)

Again the right side has a simple integral, which completes the solution:

                  x cos x dx D x sin x C cos x C C:                                                (7)

Note The new integral is not always simpler. We could have chosen u D cos x and
dv D x dx. Then v D 12 x2. Integration using those parts give the true but useless
result

           x cos x dx D uv ¡         v  du  D  1  x2  cos   x  C   1  x2  sin  x  dx:
                                               2                   2

The last integral is harder instead of easier (x2 is worse than x). In the forward
                                                                                  1
direction this is no help. But in the opposite direction it simplifies            2  x  2  sin  x  d  x  .

The idea in choosing u and v is this: Try to give u a nice derivative and dv a nice

integral.

EXAMPLE 3 For .cos x/2 dx choose u D cos x and dv D cos x dx (so v D sin x):

            .cos x/2 dx D uv ¡ v du D cos x sin x C .sin x/2 dx:

  The integral of .sin x/2 is no better and no worse than the integral of .cos x/2. But

we never see .sin x/2 without thinking of 1 ¡ .cos x/2. So substitute for .sin x/2:
           .cos x/2 dx D cos x sin x C 1 dx ¡ .cos x/2 dx:

The last integral on the right joins its twin on the left, and 1 dx D x:

                  2 .cos x/2 dx D cos x sin x C x:

Dividing by 2 gives the answer, which is definitely not 31 .cos x/3. Add any C :

                  .cos  x/2  dx      D  1  .cos  x  sin  x  C  x/  C  C:                           (8)
                                        2

Question Integrate .cos x/2 from 0 to 2. Why should the area be  ?

Answer The definite integral is 21 .cos x sin x C x/ 0 2 . This does give . That
area can also be found by common sense, starting from .cos x/2 C .sin x/2 D 1. The
area under 1 is 2. The areas under .cos x/2 and .sin x/2 are the same. So each one

is .

EXAMPLE 4 Evaluate tan¡1 x dx by choosing u D tan¡1 x and v D x:

           ÷  ¡1                     ÷                   ¡1        ÷         dx

              tan x dx D uv ¡ v du D x tan x ¡ x 1 C x2 : (9)

The last integral has w D 1 C x2 below and almost has dw D 2x dx above:

              ÷                   ÷
                 x dx 1 dw 1                                1
                 1 C x2 D 2 w D 2 ln w D 2 ln.1 C x /:                    2

Substituting back into (9) gives     tan¡1 x dx     as   x  tan¡1 x ¡  1     ln.1 C x2/.   All     the
                                                                       2
familiar inverse functions can be integrated by parts (take v D x, and add "CC " at

the end).

Our final example shows how two integrations by parts may be needed, when the

first one only simplifies the problem half way.
344  7 Techniques of Integration

     EXAMPLE 5 For x2ex dx choose u D x2 and dv D ex dx (so v D ex):

     x2ex dx D uv ¡ v du D x2ex ¡ ex.2x dx/:                                             (10)

     The last integral involves xex. This is better than x2ex, but it still needs work:

     xexdx D uv ¡ v du D xex ¡ ex dx .now u D x/:                                        (11)

     Finally ex is alone. After two integrations by parts, we reach exdx. In equation (11),
     the integral of xex is xex ¡ ex. Substituting back into (10),
     x2ex dx D x2ex ¡ 2 OExex ¡ ex C C:
                                                                                         (12)

     These five examples are in the list of prime candidates for integration by parts:

      xnex; xn sin x; xn cos x; xn ln x; ex sin x; ex cos x; sin¡1 x; tan¡1 x; : : : :

     This concludes the presentation of the method--brief and straightforward.
     Figure 7.1a shows how the areas u dv and v du fill out the difference between
     the big area u.b/v.b/ and the smaller area u.a/v.a/.

     Fig. 7.1 The geometry of integration by parts. Delta function (area 1) multiplies v.x/ at
                 x D0:

       In the movie Stand and Deliver, the Los Angeles teacher Jaime Escalante
     computed x2 sin x dx with two integrations by parts. His success was through
     exercises--plus insight in choosing u and v. (Notice the difference from x sin x2 dx.
     That falls the other way--to a substitution.) The class did extremely well on the
     Advanced Placement Exam. If you saw the movie, you remember that the examiner
     didn't believe it was possible. I spoke to him long after, and he confirms that practice
     was the key.

                                            THE DELTA FUNCTION

     From the most familiar functions we move to the least familiar. The delta function
     is the derivative of a step function. The step function U.x/ jumps from 0 to 1 at
     x D 0. We write i.x/ D d U=dx, recognizing as we do it that there is no genuine
     derivative at the jump. The delta function is the limit of higher and higher spikes--
     from the "burst of speed" in Section 1.2. They approach an infinite spike concentrated
     at a single point (where U jumps). This "non-function" may be unconventional--it is
     certainly optional--but it is important enough to come back to.

       The slope d U=dx is zero except at x D 0, where the step function jumps. Thus
     i.x/ D 0 except at that one point, where the delta function has a "spike." We cannot
     give a value for i at x D 0, but we know its integral across the jump. On every

     interval from ¡A to A, the integral of d U=dx brings back U :

                          ÷ A ÷ A d U A

                         ¡A i.x/ dx D ¡A dx dx D U.x/ ¡A D 1: (13)

     "The area under the infinitely tall and infinitely thin spike i.x/ equals 1."

  So far so good. The integral of i.x/ is U.x/. We now integrate by parts for a crucial
purpose--to find the area under v.x/i.x/. This is an ordinary function times the
delta function. In some sense v.x/ times i.x/ equals v.0/ times i.x/--because away
from x D 0 the product is always zero. Thus exi.x/ equals i.x/, and sin x i.x/ D 0.

  The area under v.x/i.x/ is v.0/--which integration by parts will prove:

                                                                   A

7B The integral of v.x/ times i.x/ is ¡A v.x/i.x/dx D v.0/.

The area is v.0/ because the spike is multiplied by v.0/--the value of the smooth
function v.x/ at the spike. But multiplying infinity is dangerous, to say the least.
(Two times infinity is infinity). We cannot deal directly with the delta function. It is
only known by its integrals! As long as the applications produce integrals (as they
do), we can avoid the fact that i is not a true function.

  The integral of v.x/i.x/ D v.x/d U=dx is computed "by parts:"

   ÷ A iA ÷ A v.x/i.x/ dx D v.x/U.x/ ¡ U.x/ dv dx: (14)
   ¡A         ¡A ¡A dx

Remember that U D 0 or U D 1. The right side of (14) is our area v.0/:

   ÷ A v.A/ ¤ 1 ¡ 1 dv dx D v.A/ ¡ .v.A/ ¡ v.0// D v.0/: (15)

                0 dx

When v.x/ D 1, this answer matches i dx D 1. We give three examples:

2          6      1                                                   2
¡2 cos x i.x/ dx D 1 ¡5.U.x/ C i.x//dx D 7 ¡1.i.x// dx D :

A nightmare question occurs to me. What is the derivative of the delta function ?

       INTEGRATION BY PARTS IN ENGINEERING

Physics and engineering and economics frequently involve products. Work is force
times distance. Power is voltage times current. Income is price times quantity. When
there are several forces or currents or sales, we add the products. When there are
infinitely many, we integrate (probably by parts).

  I start with differential equations for the displacement u at point x in a bar:

       ¡ dv D f .x/ with v.x/ D k du : (16)
       dx     dx

This describes a hanging bar pulled down by a force f .x/. Each point x moves through
a distance u.x/. The top of the bar is fixed, so u.0/ D 0. The stretching in the bar is
du=dx. The internal force created by stretching is v D k du=dx. (This is Hooke's
law.) Equation (16) is a balance of forces on the small piece of the bar in Figure 7.2.

                               v D W at x D 1 balances hanging weight

                     EXAMPLE 6 Suppose f .x/ D F , a constant force per unit length. We can solve (16):

                               v.x/ D ¡F x C C  and  k             u  .  x  /  D  ¡  1  F  x  2  C  C  x  C  D:  (17)
                                                                                     2

                     The constants C and D are settled at the endpoints (as usual for integrals). At x D 0
                     we are given u D 0 so D D 0. At x D 1 we are given v D W so C D W C F . Then
                     v.x/ and u.x/ give force and displacement in the bar.

                      To see integration by parts, multiply ¡dv=dx D f .x/ by u.x/ and integrate:

                     ÷ 1 ÷ 1 f .x/u.x/ dx D ¡ dv i1 ÷ 1 u.x/ dx D ¡u.x/v.x/ C v.x/ du dx: (18)
                         0         0 dx                                                    00                dx

                     The left side is force times displacement, or external work. The last term is inter-
                     nal force times stretching--or internal work. The integrated term has u.0/ D 0--the

                     fixed support does no work. It also has ¡u.1/W , the work by the hanging weight.

                     The balance of forces has been replaced by a balance of work.

                       This is a touch of engineering mathematics, and here is the main point. Integration

                     by parts makes physical sense! When ¡dv=dx D f is multiplied by other functions--

                     called test functions or virtual displacements--then equation (18) becomes the

                     principle of virtual work. It is absolutely basic to mechanics.

                             7.2 Trigonometric Integrals

     The next section will put old integrals into new forms. For example x2 1 ¡ x2 dx

     will become sin2 cos2  d . That looks simpler because the square root is gone.
     But still sin2 cos2 has to be integrated. This brief section integrates any product
     of sines and cosines and secants and tangents.

       There are two methods to choose from. One uses integration by parts, the other
     is based on trigonometric identities. Both methods try to make the integral easy (but
     that may take time). We follow convention by changing the letter  back to x.

       Notice that sin4x cos x dx is easy to integrate. It is u4du: This is the goal in
     Example 1--to separate out cos x dx: It becomes du; and sin x is u:

     EXAMPLE 1 sin2xcos3x dx (the exponent 3 is odd)

     Solution Keep cos x dx as du: Convert the other cos2x to 1 ¡ sin2x:

          sin2xcos3x dx D sin2x.1 ¡ sin2 ÷ ÷ x/ cos x dx D sin3x ¡ sin5x C C:
                                                                                   3        5

     EXAMPLE 2 sin5x dx (the exponent 5 is odd)

     Solution Keep sin x dx and convert everything else to cosines. The conversion
     is always based on sin2x C cos2x D 1:

              .1 ¡ cos2x/2 sin x dx D .1 ¡ 2 cos2x C cos4x/ sin x dx:
     Now cos x is u and ¡ sin x dx is du: We have .¡1 C 2u2 ¡ u4/du:

     General method for sinmx cosnx dx; when m or n is odd

     If n is odd, separate out a single cos x dx: That leaves an even number of cosines.
       Convert them to sines. Then cos x dx is du and the sines are u's.

     If m is odd, separate out a single sin x dx as du: Convert the rest to cosines.
     If m and n are both odd, use either method.
     If m and n are both even, a new method is needed. Here are two examples.

     EXAMPLE 3 cos2x dx (m D 0; n D 2; both even)

     There are two good ways to integrate cos2x; but substitution is not one of them. If
     u equals cos x; then du is not here. The successful methods are integration by parts
     and double-angle formulas. Both answers are in equation (2) below--I don't see
     either one as the obvious winner.

       Integrating cos2x by parts was Example 3 of Section 7.1. The other approach, by
     double angles, is based on these formulas from trigonometry:

                cos2x D 21 1 C cos 2x sin2x D 21 1 ¡ cos 2x (1)

     The  integral  of  cos  2x  is  1  sin  2x:  So  these  formulas  can   be    integrated  directly.  They
                                     2

     give the only integrals you should memorize--either the integration by parts form,

     or the result from these double angles:

          cos2x dx equals            21 x C sin x cos x      or  1     x     C  1  sin  2x  .plus C /:    (2)
                                                                 2              4

          sin2x dx equals                                              1  x     1  sin  2x  .plus C /:    (3)
                                                                       2        4

EXAMPLE 4 cos4x dx (m D 0; n D 4; both are even)

Changing cos2x to 1 ¡ sin2x gets us nowhere. All exponents stay even. Substituting

u D sin x won't simplify sin4x dx; without du: Integrate by parts or switch to 2x:
First solution Integrate by parts. Take u D cos3x and dv D cos x dx:

 .cos3x/.cos x dx/ D uv ¡ v du D cos3x sin x ¡ .sin x/.¡3cos2x sin x dx/:

The last integral has even powers sin2x and cos2x: This looks like no progress.

Replacing sin2x by 1 ¡ cos2x produces cos4x on the right-hand side also:
           cos4x dx D cos3x sin x C 3 cos2x.1 ¡ cos2x/dx:

Always even powers in the integrals. But now move 3 cos4x dx to the left side:

Reduction                4 cos4x dx D cos3x sin x C 3 cos2x dx:                                                                        (4)

Partial success--the problem is reduced from cos4x to cos2x: Still an even power,
but a lower power. The integral of cos2x is already known. Use it in equation (4):

                  cos4x     dx    D     1  cos3x       sin  x  C  3  ¤  1  x C sin x         cos xC C:                                 (5)
                                        4                         4     2

Second solution       Substitute           the      double-angle           formula        cos2x       D     1  C     1     cos 2x:
                                                                                                            2        2

        cos4x dx D . 12 C 12 cos 2x/2dx D 14 .1 C 2 cos 2x C cos2 2x/dx:

Certainly dx D x: Also 2 cos 2x dx D sin 2x: That leaves the cosine squared:

                  cos22x D                 1  .1    C  cos  4x/dx       D     1  x  C  1  sin   4x    C     C:
                                           2                                  2        8

The integral of cos4x using double angles is

                               41 x C sin 2x C 21 x C 81 sin 4x C C: (6)

That solution looks different from equation (5), but it can't be. There all angles were
x; here we have 2x and 4x: We went from cos4x to cos22x to cos 4x; which was

integrated immediately. The powers were cut in half as the angle was doubled.

     Double-angle method for sinmx cosnx dx; when m and n are even:

Replace    sin2x  by  1  .  1  ¡  c  o  s  2  x  /  and  cos2x    by       1  .1  C  cos  2x    /:  The        exponents               drop
                      2                                                    2
to m=2 and n=2: If those are even, repeat the idea (2x goes to 4x). If m=2 or n=2 is

odd, switch to the "general method" using substitution. With an odd power, we have

du:

EXAMPLE 5 (Double angle)                            sin2x cos2x dx D                   1  .  1  ¡  c  o  s  2  x  /  .  1  C  c  o  s  2  x  /  d  x  :
                                                                                       4

This leaves 1 ¡ cos2 2x in the last integral. That is familiar but not necessarily easy.

We can look it up (safest) or remember it (quickest) or use double angles again:

     1  ÷                                  1÷  1 1                                   x sin 4x

     4 .1 ¡ cos 2x/dx D 4 1 ¡ 2 ¡ 2 cos 4x dx D 8 ¡ 32 C C:2

Conclusion Every sinmx cosnx can be integrated. This includes negative m and
n-- see tangents and secants below. Symbolic codes like MACSYMA or Mathemat-
ica give the answer directly. Do they use double angles or integration by parts ?
350                                 7 Techniques of Integration

       You may prefer the answer from integration by parts (I usually do). It avoids 2x
     and 4x: But it makes no sense to go through every step every time. Either a computer

     does the algebra, or we use a "reduction formula" from n to n ¡ 2:

     Reduction n cosnx dx D cosn¡1x sin x C .n ¡ 1/ cosn¡2x dx:                                     (7)

     For n D 2 this is cos2x dx--the integral to learn. For n D 4 the reduction produces
     cos2x: The integral of cos6x goes to cos4x: There are similar reduction formulas for
     sinmx and also for sinmx cosnx: I don't see a good reason to memorize them.

                              INTEGRALS WITH ANGLES px AND qx

     Instead of sin8x times cos6x; suppose you have sin 8x times cos 6x: How do you
     integrate ? Separately a sine and cosine are easy. The new question is the integral of
     the product:

     EXAMPLE 6 Find 02 sin 8x cos 6x dx: More generally find 02 sin px cos qx dx.

     This is not for the sake of making up new problems. I believe these are the most
     important definite integrals in this chapter (p and q are 0; 1; 2; : : :). They may be

     the most important in all of mathematics, especially because the question has such a
     beautiful answer. The integrals are zero. On that fact rests the success of Fourier

     series, and the whole industry of signal processing.
       One approach (the slow way) is to replace sin 8x and cos 6x by powers of cosines.

     That involves cos14x: The integration is not fun. A better approach, which applies to
     all angles px and qx; is to use the identity

                          sin  px   cos  qx  D  1  sin.p   C q/x  C  1  sin.p  ¡ q/x:               (8)
                                                2                    2

     Thus  sin   8x  cos  6x D   1  sin  14  x  C  1  sin  2x:  Separated  like  that,  sines  are  easy  to
                                 2                 2
     integrate:

                 ÷ 2  sin 8x cos 6x dx D ¡ 1 cos 14x ¡ 1 cos 2x 2 D 0:
                     0                                     2 14         22 0

     Since cos 14x is periodic, it has the same value at 0 and 2: Subtraction gives zero.
     The same is true for cos 2x: The integral of sine times cosine is always zero over a
     complete period (like 0 to 2).

       What about sin px sin qx and cos px cos qx ? Their integrals are also zero,
     provided p is different from q. When p D q we have a perfect square. There is
     no negative area to cancel the positive area. The integral of cos2px or sin2px is :

     EXAMPLE 7                   02 sin 8x sin 7x dx D 0 and 02 sin2 8x dx D :

     With two sines or two cosines (instead of sine times cosine), we go back to the
     addition formulas of Section 1.5. Problem 24 derives these formulas:

                        sin  px  sin  qx  D¡ 21    cos.p C q/x C     1  cos.p ¡ q/x                 (9)
                                                                     2

                        cos px cos qx D         1  cos.p C q/x C     1  cos.p ¡ q/x:                (10)
                                                2                    2

     With p D 8 and q D 7; we get cos 15x and cos x: Their definite integrals are zero.
     With p D 8 and q D 8; we get cos 16x and cos 0x (which is 1). Formulas (9) and (10)
                                  7.2 Trigonometric Integrals                                              351

also  give  a  factor  21 :  The  integral  of  1  is  :
                                                2

      02 sin 8x sin 7x dx D ¡ 2 0 1 2 cos 15x dx C 2 0 1 2 cos x dx D 0 C 0
      02 sin 8x sin 8x dx D ¡ 2 0 1 2 cos 16x dx C 2 0 1 2 cos 0x dx D 0 C 

The answer zero is memorable. The answer  appears constantly in Fourier series.

No ordinary numbers are seen in these integrals. The case p D q D 1 brings back
                   1      1
cos2x       dx  D  2   C  4  sin  2x:

                                  SECANTS AND TANGENTS

When we allow negative powers m and n; the main fact remains true. All integrals
  sinmx cosnx dx can be expressed by known functions. The novelty for negative

powers is that logarithms appear. That happens right at the start, for sin x= cos x
and for 1= cos x (tangent and secant):

      tan x dx D¡ du=u D¡ln cos x                                         .here u D cos x/

      sec x dx D du=u D ln sec x C tan x .here u D sec x C tan x/:

  For higher powers there is one key identity: 1 C tan2x D sec2x: That is the old
identity cos2x C sin2x D 1 in disguise (just divide by cos2x). We switch tangents to

secants just as we switched sines to cosines. Since .tan x/½ D sec2x and .sec x/½ D

sec x tan x; nothing else comes in.

EXAMPLE 9 tan3x dx D tan x.sec2x ¡ 1/dx:

Same idea--separate off .tan x/2 as sec2x ¡ 1: Then integrate .tan x/m¡2sec2x dx;

which is um¡2du: This leaves the integral on the right, with the exponent lowered by

2: Every power .tan x/m is eventually reduced to Example 8 or 9.

EXAMPLE 11 sec3x dx D uv ¡ v du D sec x tan x ¡ tan2x sec x dx

This was integration by parts, with u D sec x and v D tan x: In the integral on the

right, replace tan2x by sec2x ¡ 1 (this identity is basic):

                   sec3x dx D sec x tan x ¡ sec3x dx C sec x dx:

Bring sec3x dx to the left side. That reduces the problem from sec3x to sec x:

  I believe those examples make the point--trigonometric integrals are computable.
Every product tanmx secnx can be reduced to one of these examples. If n is even we

substitute u D tan x: If m is odd we set u D sec x: If m is even and n is odd, use a

reduction formula (and always use tan2x D sec2x ¡ 1:)

     I                  mention  very  briefly  a  completely  different  substitution  u  D  tan  1  x:  This  seems
                                                                                                   2

     The x-integral can involve sums as well as products--not only sinmx cosnx but

     also 1=.5 C sin x ¡ tan x/: (No square roots.) The u-integral is a ratio of ordinary

     polynomials. It is done by partial fractions.

                        Application of sec x dx to distance on a map (Mercator projection)

     The strange integral ln.sec x C tan x/ has an everyday application. It measures the
     distance from the equator to latitude x; on a Mercator map of the world.

       All mapmakers face the impossibility of putting part of a sphere onto a flat page.
     You can't preserve distances, when an orange peel is flattened. But angles can be
     preserved, and Mercator found a way to do it. His map came before Newton and
     Leibniz. Amazingly, and accidentally, somebody matched distances on the map with
     a table of logarithms--and discovered sec x dx before calculus. You would not be
     surprised to meet sin x; but who would recognize ln.sec x C tan x/ ?

       The map starts with strips at all latitudes x: The heights are dx; the lengths are
     proportional to cos x: We stretch the strips by 1= cos x--then Figure 7.3c lines up
     evenly on the page. When dx is also divided by cos x; angles are preserved--a small

              Fig. 7.3 Strips at latitude x are scaled by sec x; making Greenland too large.

     square becomes a bigger square. The distance north adds up the strip heights
     dx= cos x: This gives sec x dx:

       The distance to the North Pole is infinite! Close to the Pole, maps are stretched
     totally out of shape. When sailors wanted to go from A to B at a constant angle with
     the North Star, they looked on Mercator's map to find the angle.

                 7.3 Trigonometric Substitutions

The most powerful tool we have, for integrating with pencil and paper and brain, is
the method of substitution. To make it work, we have to think of good substitutions--
which make the integral simpler. This section concentrates on the single most valuable
collection of substitutions. They are the only ones you should memorize, and two
examples are given immediately.

                                                                                 du 

 To integrate 1 ¡ x2; substitute x D sin : Do not set u D 1 ¡ x2 dx is missing

÷                        ÷                                   ÷ dx               ÷ cos  d

   1 ¡ x2 dx .cos  /.cos  d /                                    1¡x2                 cos 

The expression 1 ¡ x2 is awkward as a function of x: It becomes graceful as a
function of : We are practically invited to use the equation 1 ¡ .sin  /2 D .cos  /2:

Then the square root is simply cos  --provided this cosine is positive.

  Notice the change in dx. When x is sin ; dx is cos  d . Figure 7.4a shows

the original area with new letters. Figure 7.4b shows an equal area, after rewriting
 .cos  /.cos  d / as .cos2 / d: Changing from x to  gives a new height and a

new base. There is no change in area--that is the point of substitution.

 To put it bluntly: If we go from 1 ¡ x2 to cos ; and forget the difference between

dx and d; and just compute cos  d; the answer is totally wrong.

Fig. 7.4 Same area for 1 ¡ x2 dx and cos2 d: Third area is wrong: dx ¤ d

  We still need the integral of cos2: This was Example 3 of integration by parts, and
also equation 7:2:6. It is worth memorizing. The example shows this  integral, and
returns to x:

EXAMPLE 1        cos2    d     D  1  sin     cos     C  21   is  after  substitution
                                  2

           1  ¡  x2  dx  D  1  x     1  ¡  x2  C  1  sin¡1x  is  the  original  problem:
                            2                     2

We changed sin  back to x and cos  to 1 ¡ x2: Notice that  is sin¡1x. The

answer is trickier than you might expect for the area under a circular arc. Figure 7.5

shows how the two pieces of the integral are the areas of a pie-shaped wedge and a

triangle.

                            ÷        dx        ÷     cos  d                     ¡1

EXAMPLE 2                         1 ¡ x2 D cos  D  C C D sin x C C:

Remember: We already know sin¡1x: Its derivative 1= 1 ¡ x2 was computed in

Section 4.4. That solves the example. But instead of matching this special problem
356             7 Techniques of Integration

     Fig. 7.5   1 ¡ x2 dx is a sum of simpler areas. Infinite graph but finite area.

     with a memory from Chapter 4, the substitution x D sin  makes the solution

     automatic. From d D  we go back to sin¡1x:

       The rest of this section is about other substitutions. They are more complicated
     than x D sin  (but closely related). A table will display the three main choices--
     sin ; tan ; sec  --and their uses.

                                   TRIGONOMETRIC SUBSTITUTIONS

     After working with 1 ¡ x2; the next step is 4 ¡ x2: The change x D sin 
     simplified the first, but it does nothing for the second: 4 ¡ sin2 is not familiar.

     Nevertheless a factor of 2 makes everything work. Instead of x D sin ; the idea
     is to substitute x D 2 sin  :

     4 ¡ x2 D 4 ¡ 4sin2 D 2 cos  and dx D 2 cos  d:

     Notice both 2's. The integral is 4 cos2 d D 2 sin  cos  C 2: But watch closely.

     This is not 4 times the previous cos2 d ! Since x is 2 sin ;  is now sin¡1.x=2/.

     EXAMPLE 3  4 ¡ x2 dx D 4 cos2 d D x 1 ¡ .x=2/2 C 2 sin¡1.x=2/:

     Based on 1 ¡ x2 and 4 ¡ x2; here is the general rule for a2 ¡ x2: Substi-

     tute x D a sin : Then the a's separate out:

     a2 ¡ x2 D a2 ¡ a2sin2 D a cos  and dx D a cos  d:

     That is the automatic substitution to try, whenever the square root appears.

                ÷4      dx ÷ =2      4 cos  d  ÷ =2 
     EXAMPLE 4    xD0                42 ¡ 42.sin  /2 D0 D d D 2 :
                       16 ¡ x2 D0 D

     Here a2 D 16: Then a D 4 and x D 4 sin : The integral has 4 cos  above and be-
     low, so it is d: The antiderivative is just : For the definite integral notice that
     x D 4 means sin  D 1; and this means  D =2:

       A table of integrals would hide that substitution. The table only gives sin¡1.x=4/:

     There is no mention of d D : But what if 16 ¡ x2 changes to x2 ¡ 16 ?

     EXAMPLE 5         ÷8     dx x2 ¡ 16 D ?
                         xD4

     Notice the two changes--the sign in the square root and the limits on x: Example 4

     stayed inside the interval x 4; where 16 ¡ x2 has a square root. Example 5 stays
                  7.3 Trigonometric Substitutions                                     357

outside, where x2 ¡ 16 has a square root. The new problem cannot use x D 4 sin ;
because we don't want the square root of ¡cos2:

  The new substitution is x D 4 sec  . This turns the square root into 4 tan  :

x D 4 sec  gives dx D 4 sec  tan  d and x2 ¡ 16 D 16 sec2 ¡ 16 D 16 tan2:

This substitution solves the example, when the limits are changed to  :

÷ =3 4 sec  tan d ÷ =3                             i=3

          4 tan   D sec  d D ln.sec  C tan  / D ln.2 C 3/:
                                                   0
0                 0

I want to emphasize the three steps. First came the substitution x D 4 sec : An

unrecognizable integral became sec  d: Second came the new limits ( D 0 when

x D 4;  D =3 when x D 8). Then I integrated sec :

 Example 6 has the same x2 ¡ 16: So the substitution is again x D 4 sec  :

EXAMPLE 6         ÷ 16 dx ÷ =2 64 sec  tan  d ÷ =2 cos  d

                  xD8 .x2 ¡ 16/3=2 D=3 D .4 tan  /3 =3 D sin2 :

Step one substitutes x D 4 sec : Step two changes the limits to : The upper limit
x D becomes  D =2; where the secant is infinite. The limit x D 8 again means
 D =3: To get a grip on the integral, I also changed to sines and cosines.

  The integral of cos =sin2 needs another substitution! (Or else recognize

cot  csc :) With u D sin  we have du=u2 D ¡1=u D ¡1= sin  :

Solution          ÷ =2 cos  d D ¡1 =2 D ¡1 C 2 :
                  =3 sin2       sin  =3                 3

Warning With lower limit  D 0 (or x D 4) this integral would be a disaster. It di-
vides by sin 0; which is zero. This area is infinite.

.Warning/2 Example 5 also blew up at x D 4; but the area was not infinite. To make

the point directly, compare x¡1=2 to x¡3=2: Both blow up at x D 0; but the first one

has finite area:

          ÷ 1 1 i1              ÷ 1 1 dx D ¡2 1 D :
                  dx D 2 x D 2
          0x            0       0 x3=2             x0

Section 7.5 separates finite areas (slow growth of 1= x) from infinite areas (fast

growth of x¡3=2).

Last substitution Together with 16 ¡ x2 and x2 ¡ 16 comes the possibility 16 C x2:
(You might ask about ¡16 ¡ x2; but for obvious reasons we don't take its square

root.) This third form 16 C x2 requires a third substitution x D 4 tan : Then
16 C x2 D 16 C 16 tan2 D 16 sec2: Here is an example:

EXAMPLE 7         ÷ dx ÷ =2 4 sec2 d 1 =2

358                    7 Techniques of Integration

     Note There is a subtle difference between changing x to sin  and changing sin  to
     u:

            in Example 1, dx was replaced by cos  d (new method)
            in Example 6, cos  d was already there and became du (old method):

     The combination cos  d was put into the first and pulled out of the second.
       My point is that Chapter 5 needed du=dx inside the integral. Then .du=dx/dx

     became du: Now it is not necessary to see so far ahead. We can try any substi-
     tution. If it works, we win. In this section, x D sin  or sec  or tan  is bound to
     succeed.

     NEW 1 C x2 D d by trying x D tan   OLD 1 C x2 D 2u by seeing du

       We mention the hyperbolic substitutions tanh ; sinh ; and cosh : The table
     below shows their use. They give new forms for the same integrals. If you are familiar
     with hyperbolic functions the new form might look simpler--as it does in Example 8.

     x D a tanh  replaces a2 ¡ x2 by a2 sech2 and dx by a sech2 d

      x D a sinh  replaces a2 C x2 by a2 cosh2 and dx by a cosh  d

     x D a cosh  replaces x2 ¡ a2 by a2 sinh2 and dx by a sinh  d

                    ÷  dx        ÷  sinh  d              ¡1

     EXAMPLE 8         x2 ¡1 D                  D  C C D cosh x C C:
                                      sinh 

        d is simple. The bad part is cosh¡1x at the end. Compare with x D sec  :

     ÷  dx       ÷  sec  tan  d

        x2 ¡1 D     tan  D ln.sec  C tan  / C C D ln.x C x ¡ 1/ C C:2

     This way looks harder, but most tables prefer that final logarithm. It is clearer than

     cosh¡1x; even if it takes more space. All answers agree if Problem 35 is correct.

                                        COMPLETING THE SQUARE

     We have not said what to do for x2 ¡ 2x C 2 or ¡x2 C 2x: Those square roots

     contain a linear term--a multiple of x: The device for removing linear terms is worth
     knowing. It is called completing the square, and two examples will begin to explain
     it:

                    x2 ¡ 2x C 2 D .x ¡ 1/2 C 1 D u2 C 1
                     ¡x2 C 2x D ¡.x ¡ 1/2 C 1 D 1 ¡ u2:

     The idea has three steps. First, get the x2 and x terms into one square. Here that square

     was .x ¡ 1/2 D x2 ¡ 2x C 1: Second, fix up the constant term. Here we recover the
     original functions by adding 1: Third, set u D x ¡ 1 to leave no linear term. Then the

     integral goes forward based on the substitutions of this section:

            ÷ dx       ÷ du             ÷ dx             ÷ du
                x2 ¡ 2x C 1 D u2 C 1         2x ¡ x2 D 1 ¡ u2
                                                              7.3 Trigonometric Substitutions                                                                                   359

                    The same idea applies to any quadratic that contains a linear term 2bx:

                          rewrite x2 C 2bx C c as .x C b/2 C C; with C D c ¡ b2
                          rewrite ¡x2 C 2bx C c as ¡.x ¡ b/2 C C; with C D c C b2

                    To match the quadratic with the square, we fix up the constant:

                            x2 C 10x C 16 D .x C 5/2 C C leads to C D 16 ¡ 25 D ¡9
                          ¡x2 C 10x C 16 D¡ .x ¡ 5/2 C C leads to C D 16 C 25 D 41:

                                                                    ÷ dx                                     ÷ dx                           ÷ du
                    EXAMPLE 9                                          x2 C 10x C 16 D .x C 5/2 ¡ 9 D u2 ¡ 9:

                    Here u D x C 5 and du D dx: Now comes a choice--struggle on with u D 3 sec 

                    or look for du=.u2 ¡ a2/ inside the front cover. Then set a D 3:

                                                           ÷ du D 1 §§ ln § u ¡ 3 §§§ D 1 §§ ln § x C 2 §§§ :

                    Note If the quadratic starts with 5x2 or ¡5x2; factor out the 5 first:

                    the square) is positive or negative. We either have C D a2 or C D ¡a2: The same

                    dividing line in the original x2 C 2bx C c is between c b2 and c b2: In between,

                    c D b2 yields the perfect square .x C b/2-- and no trigonometric substitution at all.

                7.4 Partial Fractions

     This section is about rational functions P .x/=Q.x/: Sometimes their integrals
     are also rational functions (ratios of polynomials). More often they are not. It is
     very common for the integral of P =Q to involve logarithms. We meet logarithms

     immediately in the simple case 1=.x ¡ 2/; whose integral is ln x ¡ 2 C C: We meet

     them again in a sum of simple cases:

          ÷  1 C 3 ¡ 4  dx D ln x ¡ 2 C 3 ln x C 2 ¡ 4 ln x C C:
             x¡2 xC2 x

     Our plan is to split P =Q into a sum like this--and integrate each piece.

     Which rational function produced that particular sum ? It was

     1 C 3 ¡ 4 D .x C 2/.x/ C 3.x ¡ 2/.x/ ¡4.x ¡ 2/.x C 2/ D ¡4x C 16 :
     x¡2 xC2 x              .x ¡ 2/.x C 2/.x/                       .x ¡ 2/.x C 2/.x/

     This is P =Q: It is a ratio of polynomials, degree 1 over degree 3: The pieces of P are

     collected into ¡4x C 16: The common denominator .x ¡ 2/.x C 2/.x/ D x3¡ 4x

     is Q: But I kept these factors separate, for the following reason. When we start with

     P =Q; and break it into a sum of pieces, the first things we need are the factors of

     Q.

       In the standard problem P =Q is given. To integrate it, we break it up. The goal of
     partial fractions is to find the pieces--to prepare for integration. That is the tech-
     nique to learn in this section, and we start right away with examples.

     EXAMPLE 1 Suppose P =Q has the same Q but a different numerator P :

                 P D 3x2 C 8x ¡ 4 D A C B C C : (1)
                 Q .x ¡ 2/.x C 2/.x/ x ¡ 2 x C 2 x

     Notice the form of those pieces! They are the "partial fractions" that add to P =Q:

     Each one is a constant divided by a factor of Q: We know the factors x ¡ 2 and x C 2
     and x: We don't know the constants A; B; C: In the previous case they were 1; 3; ¡4:

     In this and other examples, there are two ways to find them.

     Method 3 (slow) Put the right side of .1/ over the common denominator Q:

     3x2 C 8x ¡ 4 D A.x C 2/.x/ C B.x ¡ 2/.x/ C C.x ¡2/.x C 2/ (2)
     Q                      .x ¡ 2/.x C 2/.x/

     Why is A multiplied by .x C 2/.x/ ? Because canceling those factors will leave

     A=.x ¡ 2/ as in equation (1). Similarly we have B=.x C 2/ and C=x: Choose the

     numbers A; B; C so that the numerators match. As soon as they agree, the split-

     ting is correct.

     Method 4 (quicker) Multiply equation (1) by x ¡ 2: That leaves a space:

                3x2 C 8x ¡ 4 D A C B.x ¡ 2/ C C.x ¡ 2/: (3)
                .x C 2/.x/     xC2             x

     Now set x D 2 and immediately you have A. The last two terms of (3) are zero,

     because x ¡ 2 is zero when x D 2: On the left side, x D 2 gives

                3.2/2 C 8.2/ ¡ 4 D 24 D 3: .which is A/:

Notice how multiplying by x ¡ 2 produced a hole on the left side. Method 2
is the "cover-up method." Cover up x ¡ 2 and then substitute x D 2. The result

is 3 D A C 0 C 0; just what we wanted.

  In Method 1, the numerators of equation (2) must agree. The factors that multiply
B and C are again zero at x D2: That leads to the same A--but the cover-up method

avoids the unnecessary step of writing down equation (2).

Calculation of B Multiply equation (1) by x C 2; which covers up the .x C 2/:

           .x ¡2/ .x/ x ¡2                          x

Now set x D ¡2; so A and C are multiplied by zero:
               3.¡2/ D D 2 C 8.¡2/ ¡ 4 ¡8 ¡1 D B:
                .¡2 ¡2/ .¡2/ 8

This is almost full speed, but (4) was not needed. Just cover up in Q and give x the
right value (which makes the covered factor zero).

Calculation of C (quickest) In equation (1), cover up the factor .x/ and set x D 0:

           3.0/2 C 8.0/ ¡ 4 D ¡4 D 1 D C: (5)
           .0 ¡ 2/.0 C 2/                       ¡4

To repeat: The same result A D 3; B D ¡1; C D 1 comes from Method 1.

First multiply by y: That covers up y in the first two terms and changes B to By:

Then set y D 0: The equation becomes 1=c D A:

 To find B; multiply by c ¡ by: That covers up c ¡ by in the outside terms. In the
middle, A times c ¡ by will be zero at y D c=b: That leaves B on the right equal to

1=y D b=c on the left. Then A D 1=c and B D b=c give the integral announced in

  It is time to admit that the general method of partial fractions can be very

awkward. First of all, it requires the factors of the denominator Q: When Q is a
quadratic ax2 C bx C c; we can find its roots and its factors. In theory a cubic or a
364             7 Techniques of Integration

     quartic can also be factored, but in practice only a few are possible--for example x4 ¡
     1 is .x2 ¡ 1/.x2 C 1/: Even for this good example, two of the roots are imaginary.
     We can split x2 ¡ 1 into .x C 1/.x ¡ 1/: We cannot split x2 C 1 without introducing

     i:

       The method of partial fractions can work directly with x2 C 1; as we now see.

     EXAMPLE 4  ÷ 3x2 C 2x C 7   (a quadratic over a quadratic).
                       x2 C1 dx

     This has another difficulty. The degree of P equals the degree of Q.D 2/: Partial

     fractions cannot start until P has lower degree. Therefore I divide the leading
     term x2 into the leading term 3x2: That gives 3; which is separated off by itself:

                3x2 C 2x C 7     2x C 4
                x2 C 1 D 3 C x2 C 1 : (8)

     Note how 3 really used 3x2 C 3 from the original numerator. That left 2x C 4: Par-
     tial fractions will accept a linear factor 2x C 4 (or Ax C B; not just A) above a
     quadratic.

       This example contains 2x=.x2 C 1/; which integrates to ln.x2 C 1/: The final

     4=.x2 C 1/ integrates to 4 tan¡1 x: When the denominator is x2 C x C 1 we com-

     plete the square before integrating. The point of Sections 7.2 and 7.3 was to make that

     integration possible. This section gets the fraction ready--in parts.

       The essential point is that we never have to go higher than quadratics. Every
     denominator Q can be split into linear factors and quadratic factors. There
     is no magic way to find those factors, and most examples begin by giving them. They
     go into their own fractions, and they have their own numerators--which are the A and
     B and 2x C 4 we have been computing.

       The one remaining question is what to do if a factor is repeated. This happens in
     Example 5.

     EXAMPLE 5  2x C 3 D         AC      B
                                             2:
                .x ¡1/2 .x ¡1/ .x ¡1/

     The key is the new term B=.x ¡ 1/2: That is the right form to expect. With .x ¡ 1/
     .x ¡ 2/ this term would have been B=.x ¡ 2/: But when .x ¡ 1/ is repeated, some-
     thing new is needed. To find B; multiply through by .x ¡ 1/2 and set x D 1:

     2x C 3 D A.x ¡ 1/ C B becomes 5 D B when x D 1:

     This cover-up method gives B: Then A D 2 is easy, and the integral is

     2 ln x ¡ 1 ¡ 5=.x ¡ 1/: The fraction 5=.x ¡ 1/2 has an integral without logarithms.

     EXAMPLE 6    2x3 C 9x2 C 4 A B Cx C D E

                x2.x2 C 4/.x ¡ 1/ D x C x2 C x2 C 4 C x ¡ 1 :

     This final example has almost everything! It is more of a game than a calculus

     problem. In fact calculus doesn't enter until we integrate (and nothing is new there).

     Before computing A; B; C; D; E; we write down the overall rules for partial fractions:

     1. The degree of P must be less than the degree of Q: Otherwise divide their

        leading terms as in equation (8) to lower the degree of P: Here 3 5:

     2. Expect the fractions illustrated by Example 6. The linear factors x and x C 1
        (and the repeated x2) are underneath constants. The quadratic x2 C 4 is under
        a linear term. A repeated .x2 C 4/2 would be under a new F x C G:
                        7.4 Partial Fractions                                                                                    365

   3. Find the numbers A; B; C; : : : by any means, including cover-up.

   4. Integrate each term separately and add.

We could prove that this method always works. It makes better sense to show that
it works once, in Example 6.

 To find E; cover up .x ¡ 1/ on the left and substitute x D 1: Then E D 3: To
find B; cover up x2 on the left and set x D 0: Then B D 4=.0 C 4/.0 ¡ 1/ D ¡1:

The cover-up method has done its job, and there are several ways to find A; C; D:
Compare the numerators, after multiplying through by the common denominator Q:

2x3 C 9x2 C 4 D Ax.x2 C 4/.x ¡ 1/ ¡ .x2C 4/.x ¡ 1/ C .Cx C D/.x2/.x ¡ 1/ C 3x2.x2 C 4/:
The known terms on the right, from B D ¡1 and E D 3; can move to the left:

    ¡3x4 C 3x3 ¡ 4x2 C 4x D Ax.x2 C 4/.x ¡ 1/ C .Cx C D/x2.x ¡ 1/:
We can divide through by x and x ¡ 1; which checks that B and E were correct:

               ¡3x2 ¡ 4 D A.x2 C 4/ C .Cx C D/x:
Finally x D 0 yields A D ¡1: This leaves ¡2x2 D .Cx C D/x: Then C D ¡2 and

D D 0:
  You should never have to do such a problem! I never intend to do another one. It

completely depends on expecting the right form and matching the numerators.
They could also be matched by comparing coefficients of x4; x3; x2; x; 1--to give
five equations for A; B; C; D; E: That is an invitation to human error. Cover-up is
the way to start, and usually the way to finish. With repeated factors and quadratic
factors, match numerators at the end.

                            7.5 Improper Integrals

                                                    b
"Improper" means that some part of a y.x/ dx becomes infinite. It might be b or a
or the function y: The region under the graph reaches infinitely far--to the right or left
or up or down. (Those come from b D and a D ¡ and y                                       and y ¡ :)

Nevertheless the integral may "converge." Just because the region is infinite, it is not

automatic that the area is infinite. That is the point of this section--to decide when

improper integrals have proper answers.                                  ; then a D ¡     ; then y D 1= x
  The first examples show finite area when b D

at x D 0: The areas in Figure 7.6 are 1; 1; 2:

÷ dx D ¡ 1  D 1                      ÷0                         i0                  ÷ 1 dx                i1
                                                                                             D2          x D 2:

           Fig. 7.6 The shaded areas are finite but the regions go to infinity.

  In practice we substitute the dangerous limits and watch what happens. When

the integral is ¡1=x; substituting b D gives "¡1= D 0:" When the integral is
ex; substituting a D ¡ gives "e¡ D 0:" I think that is fair, and I know it is suc-

cessful. But it is not completely precise.

  The strict rules involve a limit. Calculus sneaks up on 1= and e¡ just as it

sneaks up on 0=0: Instead of swallowing an infinite region all at once, the formal

definitions push out to the limit:

The conclusion is the same. The first examples converged to 1; 1; 2: Now come two
more examples going out to b D :

     The area under 1=x is finite if p 1 W                               pD               D                    : (2)
                                                                         1 x 1¡p 1 p¡1

The  area  under  1=x   is  like  1  C  1  C  1  C     1  C  ¤  ¤  ¤  ,  which  is  also  infinite.  In  fact  the  sum
                                        2     3        4
approximates the integral--the curved area is close to the rectangular area. They go

together (slowly to infinity).

  A larger p brings the graph more quickly to zero. Figure 7.7a shows a finite area

1=.p ¡ 1/ D 100: The region is still infinite, but we can cover it with strips cut out of

a square! The borderline for finite area is p D 1: I call it the borderline, but p D 1 is

strictly on the side of divergence.
368                        7 Techniques of Integration

       The borderline is also p D 1 when the function climbs the y axis. At x D 0; the
     graph of y D 1=xp goes to infinity. For p D 1; the area under 1=x is again infinite.

     But at x D 0 it is a small p (meaning p 1) that produces finite area:

     ÷ 1 dx i1                              ÷ 1 dx x1¡p 1 1

     Loosely speaking "¡ ln 0 D :" Strictly speaking we integrate from the point x D a
     near zero, to get a1 dx=x D ¡ ln a: As a approaches zero, the area shows itself as
     infinite. For y D 1=x2; which blows up faster, the area ¡1=x10 is again infinite.

       For y D 1= x; the area from 0 to 1 is 2: In that case p D 21 : For p D 99=100

     the area is 1=.1 ¡ p/ D 100: Approaching p D 1 the borderline in Figure 7.7 seems

     clear. But that cutoff is not as sharp as it looks.

     Fig. 7.7 Graphs of 1=xp on both sides of p D 1: I drew the same curves!

     Narrower borderline Under the graph of 1=x; the area is infinite. When we divide
     by ln x or .ln x/2; the borderline is somewhere in between. One has infinite area

     (going out to x D ), the other area is finite:

     ÷ dx i                                      ÷ dx D ¡ 1  D 1: (4)
                        D ln.ln x/ D
     e x.ln x/                    e              e x.ln x/2               ln x e

     The first is du=u with u D ln x: The logarithm of ln x does eventually make it to
     infinity. At x D 1010; the logarithm is near 23 and ln.ln x/ is near 3: That is slow!

     Even slower is ln.ln.ln x// in Problem 11: No function is exactly on the borderline.
       The second integral in equation (4) is convergent (to 1). It is du=u2 with u D

     ln x: At first I wrote it with x going from zero to infinity. That gave an answer I

     couldn't believe:  ÷ dx D ¡ 1  D 0 .<</

                         0 x.ln x/2 ln x 0

     There must be a mistake, because we are integrating a positive function. The area
     can't be zero. It is true that 1= ln b goes to zero as b : It is also true that 1= ln a
     goes to zero as a 0: But there is another infinity in this integral. The trouble is at
     x D 1; where ln x is zero and the area is infinite.

21 ¡ 21  ¡ 23  ¤ ¤ ¤ has no way to stop, but somehow 21 ! is 21 : See Problem 28:

The integral 0 x0e¡xdx D 1 is the reason behind "zero factorial"D 1: That seems

the most surprising of all.

 The area under e¡x=x is .¡1/S D : The factor e¡x is absolutely no help at x D

0: That is an example (the first of many) in which we do not know an antiderivative--

but still we get a decision. To integrate e¡x=x we need a computer. But to decide that

an improper integral is infinite (in this case) or finite (in other cases), we rely on the
following comparison test:

7C (Comparison test) Suppose that 0 u.x/ v.x/: Then the area under u.x/
is smaller than the area under v.x/:

u.x/dx if v.x/dx             if u.x/dx D then v.x/dx D :

Comparison can decide if the area is finite. We don't get the exact area, but we learn

about one function from the other. The trick is to construct a simple function (like
1=xp) which is on one side of the given function--and stays close to it:

           ÷ dx                                    ÷ dx
EXAMPLE 2  1 x2 C 4x 1 converges by comparison with x2 D 1:

           ÷ dx      diverges by comparison with  ÷ dx     D:

           ÷ 1 dx                                 ÷ 1 dx
EXAMPLE 4  0 x2 C 4x 0 diverges by comparison with 5x D :

EXAMPLE 5  ÷ 1 dx    converges by comparison with  ÷ 1 dx  D 1:

           0 xC1                                   01

In Examples 2 and 5, the integral on the right is larger than the integral on the left.
Removing 4x and x increased the area. Therefore the integrals on the left are
somewhere between 0 and 1:

  In Examples 3 and 4, we increased the denominators. The integrals on the right
are smaller, but still they diverge. So the integrals on the left diverge. The idea of
comparing functions is seen in the next examples and Figure 7.8.

                    We cannot accept ¡ D 0. The two areas must be separately finite, and in this

                    case they are not.

                    "principal value integral" is zero. But the rules say no: ¡ is not zero.

             Applications of the Integral

                        We are experts in one application of the integral--to find the area under a curve.
                      The curve is the graph of y D v.x/; extending from x D a at the left to x D b at the
                      right. The area between the curve and the x axis is the definite integral.

                         I think of that integral in the following way. The region is made up of thin strips.
                      Their width is dx and their height is v.x/: The area of a strip is v.x/ times dx:

                                                                                   b

                      The area of all the strips is a v.x/ dx: Strictly speaking, the area of one strip is
                      meaningless--genuine rectangles have width x: My point is that the picture of thin
                        strips gives the correct approach.

                          We know what function to integrate (from the picture). We also know how (from
                        this course or a calculator). The new applications to volume and length and surface
                        area cut up the region in new ways. Again the small pieces tell the story. In this
                      chapter, what to integrate is more important than how.

8.1 Areas and Volumes by Slices

This section starts with areas between curves. Then it moves to volumes, where the
strips become slices. We are weighing a loaf of bread by adding the weights of the
slices. The discussion is dominated by examples and figures--the theory is minimal.
The real problem is to set up the right integral. At the end we look at a different way
of cutting up volumes, into thin shells. All formulas are collected into final table.

  Figure 8.1 shows the area between two curves. The upper curve is the graph of

y D v.x/: The lower curve is the graph of y D w.x/: The strip height is v.x/ ¡

w.x/; from one curve down to the other. The width is dx (speaking informally again).
The total area is the integral of "top minus bottom":

EXAMPLE 1 The upper curve is y D 6x (straight line). The lower curve is y D 3x2
(parabola). The area lies between the points where those curves intersect.

To find the intersection points, solve v.x/ D w.x/ or 6x D 3x2:

One crossing is at x D 0; the other is at x D 2: The area is an integral from 0 to 2:

First question: Which area and what limits ? Start with the pie-shaped wedge in
Figure 8.1b. The area begins at the y axis and ends where the circle meets the line.

     The area is =8 (one eighth of the circle). To integrate 1 ¡ x2 dx we apply the

     techniques of Chapter 7: Set x D sin ; convert to cos2 d D 12 . C sin  cos  /;

     convert back using  D sin¡1x: It is harder than expected, for a familiar shape.

     Remark Suppose the problem is to find the whole area between the circle and

     the line. The figure shows v D w at two points, which are x D 1= 2 (already used)
     and also x D ¡1=
                             2:  Instead   of  starting  at  x  D  0;  which  gave  1  of  a  circle,  we  now
                                                                                    8

     include the area to the left.

      Main point: Integrating from x D ¡1= 2 to x D 1= 2 will give the wrong an-

     swer. It misses the part of the circle that bulges out over itself, at the far left. In that

     part, the strips have height 2v instead of v ¡ w: The figure is essential, to get the

     correct area of this half-circle.

                     HORIZONTAL STRIPS INSTEAD OF VERTICAL STRIPS

     There is more than one way to slice a region. Vertical slices give x integrals.
     Horizontal slices give y integrals. We have a free choice, and sometimes the y
     integral is better.

               Fig. 8.2 Vertical slices (x integrals) vs. horizontal slices (y integrals).

     Figure 8.2 shows a unit parallelogram, with base 1 and height 1: To find its area

     from vertical slices, three separate integrals are necessary. You should see why! With
     horizontal slices of length 1 and thickness dy; the area is just 01 dy D 1:

                                        VOLUMES BY SLICES

For the first time in this book, we now look at volumes. The regions are
three-dimensional solids. There are three coordinates x; y; z--and many ways to
cut up a solid.

  Figure 8.3 shows one basic way--using slices. The slices have thickness dx; like
strips in the plane. Instead of the height y of a strip, we now have the area A of a
cross-section. This area is different for different slices: A depends on x: The volume
of the slice is its area times its thickness: d V D A.x/dx: The volume of the whole
solid is the integral:

               volume D integral of area times thickness D A.x/ dx:                                   (2)

Note An actual slice does not have the same area on both sides! Its thickness is
x (not dx). Its volume is approximately A.x/x (but not exactly). In the limit, the
thickness approaches zero and the sum of volumes approaches the integral.

  For a cylinder all slices are the same. Figure 8.3b shows a cylinder--not circular.
The area is a fixed number A; so integration is trivial. The volume is A times h. The

               Fig. 8.3 Cross-sections have area A.x/: Volumes are A.x/ dx:

letter h; which stands for height, reminds us that the cylinder often stands on its end.

Then the slices are horizontal and the y integral or z integral goes from 0 to h:
  When the cross-section is a circle, the cylinder has volume  r2h:

EXAMPLE 4 The triangular wedge in Figure 8.3b has constant cross-sections with
            1
area  A  D  2  .3/.4/  D  6:  The    volume  is  6h:

EXAMPLE 5 For the triangular pyramid in Figure 8.3c, the area A.x/ drops from

6 to 0: It is a general rule for pyramids or cones that their volume has an extra factor
1
3  (compared      to  cylinders).    The  volume  is  now  2h  instead  of  6h:  For  a  cone  with  base

area  r2;   the   volume      is  13  r 2h:  Tapering  the  area  to    zero    leaves   only  1  of  the
                                                                                               3

   Why   the   3  ?   Triangles   sliced  from   the  pyramid  have     shorter  sides.  Starting    from
3 and 4; the side lengths 3.1 ¡ x= h/ and 4.1 ¡ x= h/ drop to zero at x D h: The area
is A D 6.1 ¡ x= h/2: Notice: The side lengths go down linearly, the area drops

                                  SOLIDS OF REVOLUTION

     Cones and spheres and circular cylinders are "solids of revolution." Rotating a
     horizontal line around the x axis gives a cylinder. Rotating a sloping line gives a

     cone. Rotating a semicircle gives a sphere. If a circle is moved away from the axis,
     rotation produces a torus (a doughnut). The rotation of any curve y D f .x/ produces
     a solid of revolution.

       The volume of that solid is made easier because every cross-section is a circle.
     All slices are pancakes (or pizzas). Rotating the curve y D f .x/ around the x axis
     gives disks of radius y; so the area is A D y2 D OEf .x/2: We add the slices:

                                                      ÷b              ÷b

     If the same curve is rotated around the y axis, it makes a champagne glass. The slices
     are horizontal. The area of a slice is x2 not y2: When y D x this area is y4:

The hole has radius 1: All of the x solid is removed, up to the point where x
reaches 1: After that, from x D 1 to x D 2; each cross-section is a disk with a hole.
The disk has radius f D x and the hole has radius g D 1: The slice is a flat ring
or a "washer." Its area is the full disk minus the area of the hole:

        VOLUMES BY CYLINDRICAL SHELLS

     Finally we look at a different way of cutting up a solid of revolution. So far it was
     cut into slices. The slices were perpendicular to the axis of revolution. Now the cuts
     are parallel to the axis, and each piece is a thin cylindrical shell. The new formula
     gives the same volume, but the integral to be computed might be easier.

       Figure 8.6a shows a solid cone. A shell is inside it. The inner radius is x and the
     outer radius is x C dx: The shell is an outer cylinder minus an inner cylinder:

      shell volume .x C dx/2h ¡ x2h D x2h C 2x.dx/h C .dx/2h ¡ x2h:

                                                                                                   (3)
     The term that matters is 2x.dx/h: The shell volume is essentially 2x (the dis-
     tance around) times dx (the thickness) times h (the height). The volume of the solid

     comes from putting together the thin shells:

           ÷

     solid volume D integral of shell volumes D 2xh dx:                               (4)

     This is the central formula of the shell method. The rest is examples.

     Remark on this volume formula It is completely typical of integration that .dx/2
     and .x/2 disappear. The reason is this. The number of shells grows like 1=x:
     Terms of order .x/2 add up to a volume of order x (approaching zero). The
     linear term involving x or dx is the one to get right. Its limit gives the integral

       2xh dx: The key is to build the solid out of shells--and to find the area or volume

     of each piece.

     EXAMPLE 11 Find the volume of a cone (base area  r2; height b) cut into shells.

     A tall shell at the center has h near b: A short shell at the outside has h near zero.
     In between the shell height h decreases linearly, reaching zero at x D r: The height

     in Figure 8.6a is h D b ¡ bx=r: Integrating over all shells gives the volume of the

     cone (with the expected 13 ):

EXAMPLE 12 Bore a hole of radius a through a sphere of radius b a:

The hole removes all points out to x D a; where the shells begin. The height of the

shell is h D 2 b2 ¡ x2: (The key is the right triangle in Figure 8.6b. The height
upward is b2 ¡ x2--this is half the height of the shell.) Therefore the sphere-with-

hole has     b  b                   b2 ¡x2 dx:

          volume D a 2xh dx D a 4x

With u D b2 ¡ x2 we almost see du: Multiplying du D ¡2x dx is an extra factor
¡2:
             volume D ¡2 u du D ¡2 23 u3=2 :              

We can find limits on u; or we can put back u D b2 ¡ x2:

          volume D ¡ 4 .b2 ¡ x2/3=2b D 4 .b2 ¡ a2/3=2:
             3  a3

If a D b (the hole is as big as the sphere) this volume is zero. If a D 0 (no hole) we
have 4b3=3 for the complete sphere.

Question What if the sphere-with-hole is cut into slices instead of shells ?
Answer Horizontal slices are washers (Problem 66). Vertical slices are not good.

EXAMPLE 13 Rotate the parabola y D x2 around the y axis to form a bowl.

We go out to x D 2 (and up to y D 2). The shells in Figure 8.6c have height

h D 2 ¡ x2: The bowl (or paraboloid) is the same as the headlight in Example 8,

Which to use, slices or shells ? Start with a vertical line going up to y D cos x:
Rotating the line around the x axis produces a slice (a circular disk). The radius is
cos x: Rotating the line around the y axis produces a shell (the outside of a cylinder).
The height is cos x: See Figure 8.7 for the slice and the shell. For volumes we just
integrate  cos2x dx (the slice volume) or 2x cos x dx (the shell volume).

  This is the normal choice--slices through the x axis and shells around the y
axis. Then y D f .x/ gives the disk radius and the shell height. The slice is a washer
instead of a disk if there is also an inner radius g.x/: No problem--just integrate

small volumes.
  What if you use slices for rotation around the y axis ? The disks are in Figure 8.7b,

and their radius is x: This is x D cos¡1y in the example. It is x D f ¡1.y/ in gen-

eral. You have to solve y D f .x/ to find x in terms of y: Similarly for shells around

               impossible.
                 When y D cos x is rotated around the x axis, here are the choices for volume:

                  8.2 Length of a Plane Curve

The graph of y D x3=2 is a curve in the x-y plane. How long is that curve ? A
definite integral needs endpoints, and we specify x D 0 and x D 4: The first problem
is to know what "length function" to integrate.

  The distance along a curve is the arc length. To set up an integral, we break the
problem into small pieces. Roughly speaking, small pieces of a smooth curve are
nearly straight. We know the exact length s of a straight piece, and Figure 8.8
shows how it comes close to a curved piece.

                       .s/2 D .x/2 C .y/2
                       .ds/2 D .dx/2  C dy .dx/2 2

                                               dx
                           ds D 1 C .dy=dx/2 dx

Fig. 8.8 Length s of short straight segment. Length ds of very short curved segment.

  Here is the unofficial reasoning that gives the length of the curve. A straight piece
has .s/2 D .x/2 C .y/2: Within that right triangle, the height y is the slope

.y=x/ times x: This secant slope is close to the slope of the curve. Thus y is

approximately .dy=dx/ x:

s .x/2 C .dy=dx/2.x/2 D 1 C .dy=dx/2 x:                                              (1)

Now add these pieces and make them smaller. The infinitesimal triangle has
.ds/2 D .dx/2 C .dy/2: Think of ds as 1 C .dy=dx/2 dx and integrate:

                                  ÷      ÷

           length of curve D ds D 1 C .dy=dx/2 dx:                                   (2)

EXAMPLE 1  Keep  y  D  x3=2  and  dy=dx  D  32 x1=2:  Watch  out  for  3  and  49 :
                                                                       2

This answer is just above 9: A straight line from .0; 0/ to .4; 8/ has exact length
80: Note 42 C 82 D 80: Since 80 is just below 9; the curve is surprisingly straight.

  You may not approve of those numbers (or the reasoning behind them). We can fix
the reasoning, but nothing can be done about the numbers. This example y D x3=2

had to be chosen carefully to make the integration possible at all. The length integral

is difficult because of the square root. In most cases we integrate numerically.

EXAMPLE 2 The straight line y D 2x from x D 0 to x D 4 has dy=dx D 2:

                   4                                         (just checking):

length D 0 1 C 4 dx D 4 5 D 80 as be-fore

  We return briefly to the reasoning. The curve is the graph of y D f .x/: Each piece

contains at least one point where secant slope equals tangent slope: y=x D f ½.c/:
384                      8 Applications of the Integral

     The Mean Value Theorem applies when the slope is continuous--this is required for

     a smooth curve. The straight length s is exactly .x/2 C .f ½.c/x/2: Adding

     the n pieces gives the length of the broken line (close to the curve):

                                                                 n        n  1 C OEf ½.ci /2 xi :

     As n  and xmax 0 this approaches the integral that gives arc length.

     The antiderivative is sin¡1x: It equals =2 at x D 1: This length =2 is a quarter of

     the full circumference 2:

     That integral can't be done in closed form. The length of an ellipse can only be
     computed numerically. The denominator is zero at x D 1, so a blind application of
     the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule would give length D : The midpoint rule
     gives length D 1:91 with thousands of intervals.

  LENGTH OF A CURVE FROM PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS: x.f / AND y.f /

We have met the unit circle in two forms. One is x2 C y2 D 1: The other is x D cos t ,
y D sin t: Since cos2t C sin2t D 1, this point goes around the correct circle. One
advantage of the "parameter" t is to give extra information--it tells where the point
is and also when. In Chapter 1, the parameter was the time and also the angle--
because we moved around the circle with speed 1:

  Using t is a natural way to give the position of a particle or a spacecraft. We can
recover the velocity if we know x and y at every time t: An equation y D f .x/ tells
the shape of the path, not the speed along it.

  Chapter 12 deals with parametric equations for curves. Here we concentrate on
the path length--which allows you to see the idea of a parameter t without too
much detail. We give x as a function of t and y as a function of t: The curve is still
approximated by straight pieces, and each piece has .s/2 D .x/2 C .y/2: But
instead of using y .dy=dx/ x; we approximate x and y separately:

  x .dx=dt /t; y .dy=dt /t; s .dx=dt /2 C .dy=dt /2 t:

8B The length of a parametric curve is an integral with respect to t :

             ds D .ds=dt / dt D .dx=dt /2 C .dy=dt /2 dt:               (6)

EXAMPLE 5 Find the length of the quarter-circle using x D cos t and y D sin t :

÷ =2                                                  ÷ =2  sin2t C cos2 ÷ =2 t dt D dt D  :
  0                                                                     2
      .dx=dt /2 C .dy=dt /2 dt D                                  0

                                                        0

The integral is simpler than 1= 1 ¡ x2, and there is one new advantage. We can

integrate around a whole circle with no trouble. Parametric equations allow a path

to close up or even cross itself. The time t keeps going and the point .x.t /; y.t //

keeps moving. In contrast, curves y D f .x/ are limited to one y for each x:

EXAMPLE 6 Find the length of the quarter-ellipse: x D cos t and y D 2 sin t :

On this path y2 C 2x2 is 2 sin2t C 2cos2t D 2 (same ellipse). The non-parametric

equation y D 2 ¡ 2x2 comes from eliminating t: We keep t :

          ÷ =2                                              ÷ =2

length D        .dx=dt /2 C .dy=dt /2 dt D                        sin2t C 2 cos2t dt: (7)

          0                                                 0

This integral (7) must equal (5). If one cannot be done, neither can the other. They
are related by x D cos t , but (7) does not blow up at the endpoints. The trapezoidal
rule gives 1:9101 with less than 100 intervals. Section 5.8 mentioned that calculators
automatically do a substitution that makes (5) more like (7).

EXAMPLE 7 The path x D t 2, y D t 3 goes from .0; 0/ to .4; 8/: Stop at t D 2:

  To find this path without the parameter t , first solve for t D x1=2: Then substitute
into the equation for yW y D t 3 D x3=2: The non-parametric form (with t elimi-
nated) is the same curve y D x3=2 as in Example 1.

  The length from the t -integral equals the length from the x-integral. This is
Problem 22.

                             If x D t then dx=dt D 1: The square root in (6) is the same as the square root
                             in (4). Thus the non-parametric form y D f .x/ is a special case of the parametric
                             form--just take t D x:

                  8.3 Area of a Surface of Revolution

     This section starts by constructing surfaces. A curve y D f .x/ is revolved around
     an axis. That produces a "surface of revolution," which is symmetric around the
     axis. If we revolve a sloping line, the result is a cone. When the line is parallel to the
     axis we get a cylinder (a pipe). By revolving a curve we might get a lamp or a lamp
     shade (or even the light bulb).

       Section 8.1 computed the volume inside that surface. This section computes the
     surface area. Previously we cut the solid into slices or shells. Now we need a good
     way to cut up the surface.

       The key idea is to revolve short straight line segments. Their slope is y=x:
     They can be the same pieces of length s that were used to find length--now we
     compute area. When revolved, a straight piece produces a "thin band" (Figure 8.10).
     The curved surface, from revolving y D f .x/, is close to the bands. The first step is
     to compute the surface area of a band.

       A small comment: Curved surfaces can also be cut into tiny patches. Each patch
     is nearly flat, like a little square. The sum of those patches leads to a double integral
     (with dx dy). Here the integral stays one-dimensional (dx or dy or dt ). Surfaces of
     revolution are special--we approximate them by bands that go all the way around.
     A band is just a belt with a slope, and its slope has an effect on its area.

     Fig. 8.10 Revolving a straight piece and a curve around the y axis and x axis.

       Revolve a small straight piece (length s not x). The center of the piece goes
     around a circle of radius r: The band is a slice of a cone. When we flatten it out

     (Problems 11 ¡ 13) we discover its area. The area is the side length s times the

     middle circumference 2 r:

             The surface area of a band is 2 rs D 2 r 1 C .y=x/2 x:

     For revolution around the y axis, the radius is r D x: For revolution around the
     x axis, the radius is the height: r D y D f .x/: Figure 8.10 shows both bands--the
     problem tells us which to use. The sum of band areas 2 r s is close to the area S
     of the curved surface. In the limit we integrate 2 r ds:

EXAMPLE 2 Revolve a piece of the straight line y D 2x around the x axis.

This answer must agree with the formula 2 r s (which it came from). The line
                                                                 1

the middle radius is r D 1 and the area is 2 5:

EXAMPLE 3 Revolve the same straight line segment around the y axis. Now the
radius is x instead of y D 2x: The area in Example 2 is cut in half:

          S D 2x ds D 01 2x 1 C 4 dx D  5:

  For surfaces as for arc length, only a few examples have convenient answers.

Watermelons and basketballs and light bulbs are in the exercises. Rather than

stretching out this section, we give a final area formula and show how to use it.
  The formula applies when there is a parameter t: Instead of .x; f .x// the points on

the curve are .x.t /; y.t //: As t varies, we move along the curve. The length formula
.ds/2 D .dx/2 C .dy/2 is expressed in terms of t .

  For the surface of revolution around the x axis, the area becomes a t -integral:

8.4 Probability and Calculus

Discrete probability usually involves careful counting. Not many samples are taken
and not many experiments are made. There is a list of possible outcomes, and a
known probability for each outcome. But probabilities go far beyond red cards and
black cards. The real questions are much more practical:

1. How often will too many passengers arrive for a flight ?
2. How many random errors do you make on a quiz ?
3. What is the chance of exactly one winner in a big lottery ?

Those are important questions and we will set up models to answer them.

  There is another point. Discrete models do not involve calculus. The number of
errors or bumped passengers or lottery winners is a small whole number. Calculus
enters for continuous probability. Instead of results that exactly equal 1 or 2 or
3, calculus deals with results that fall in a range of numbers. Continuous probability
comes up in at least two ways:

(A) An experiment is repeated many times and we take averages.
(B) The outcome lies anywhere in an interval of numbers.

In the continuous case, the probability pn of hitting a particular value x D n becomes
zero. Instead we have a probability density p.x/--which is a key idea. The chance
that a random X falls between a and b is found by integrating the density p.x/:

Prob Øa X bÙ D ab p.x/ dx: (1)

Roughly speaking, p.x/ dx is the chance of falling between x and x C dx: Cer-

tainly p.x/ 0: If a and b are the extreme limits ¡ and , including all possible

outcomes, the probability is necessarily one:

Prob Ø¡ X C Ù D ¡ p.x/ dx D 1:                                  (2)

This is a case where infinite limits of integration are natural and unavoidable. In
studying probability they create no difficulty--areas out to infinity are often easier.

  Here are typical questions involving continuous probability and calculus:

  4. How conclusive is a 53% ¡ 47% poll of 2500 voters ?

   5. Are 16 random football players safe on an elevator with capacity 3600 pounds ?

   6. How long before your car is in an accident ?

It is not so traditional for a calculus course to study these questions. They need extra
thought, beyond computing integrals (so this section is harder than average). But
probability is more important than some traditional topics, and also more interesting.

Drug testing and gene identification and market research are major applications.
Comparing Questions 1-3 with 4-6 brings out the relation of discrete to continuous--
the differences between them, and the parallels.

  It would be impossible to give here a full treatment of probability theory. I believe
you will see the point (and the use of calculus) from our examples. Frank Morgan's
lectures have been a valuable guide.

                                    DISCRETE RANDOM VARIABLES

     A discrete random variable X has a list of possible values. For two dice the outcomes
     are X D 2; 3; : : :; 12: For coin tosses (see below), the list is infinite: X D 1; 2; 3; : : ::

       A continuous variable lies in an interval a X b:

     EXAMPLE 1 Toss a fair coin until heads come up. The outcome X is the number
                                                                                                                1
     of  tosses.  The  value     of   X  is  1  or  2  or    3  or    : : :,  and  the  probability         is  2   that  X  D1

     that X D n is pn D . 12 /n--this is the chance of n ¡ 1 tails followed by heads. The
     sum of all probabilities is necessarily 1:

     EXAMPLE 2 Suppose a student (not you) makes an average of 2 unforced errors
     per hour exam. The number of actual errors on the next exam is X D 0 or 1 or 2
     or : : : : A reasonable model for the probability of n errors--when they are random
     and independent--is the Poisson model (pronounced Pwason):

                                                                    nS
     The probabilities of no errors, one error, and two errors are p0; p1; and p2:

     The probability of more than two errors is 1 ¡ :135 ¡ :27 ¡ :27 D :325:

       This Poisson model can be derived theoretically or tested experimentally. The total
     probability is again 1; from the infinite series (Section 6:6) for e2:

     EXAMPLE 3 Suppose on average 3 out of 100 passengers with reservations don't
     show up for a flight. If the plane holds 98 passengers, what is the probability that
     someone will be bumped ?

     If the passengers come independently to the airport, use the Poisson model with 2
     changed to 3: X is the number of no-shows, and X D n happens with probability pn:

                  pn D 3 e n ¡3                 p0 D 3 e 0 ¡3                 p 31 1 D e¡3 D 3e¡3:

                             CONTINUOUS RANDOM VARIABLES

If X is the lifetime of a VCR, all numbers X 0 are possible. If X is a score on
the SAT, then 200 X 800: If X is the fraction of computer owners in a poll of
600 people, X is between 0 and 1: You may object that the SAT score is a whole
number and the fraction of computer owners must be 0 or 1=600 or 2=600 or : : :: But
it is completely impractical to work with 601 discrete possibilities. Instead we take
X to be a continuous random variable, falling anywhere in the range X 0 or
OE200; 800 or 0 X 1: Of course the various values of X are not equally probable.

EXAMPLE 4 The average lifetime of a VCR is 4 years. A reasonable model for
breakdown time is an exponential random variable. Its probability density is

                       p.x/ D 14 e¡x=4 for 0 x :

The probability that the VCR will eventually break is 1:

             1 0 4 e¡x=4 dx D ¡e¡x=40 D 0 ¡ .¡1/ D 1: (4)

The probability of breakdown within 12 years (X from 0 to 12) is :95:

An exponential distribution has p.x/ D ae¡ax: Its integral from 0 to x is

  To repeat: The probability that a X b is the integral of p.x/ from a to b.

Fig. 8.11 Probabilities add to  pn D 1: Continuous density integrates to p.x/ dx D 1:

EXAMPLE 5 We now define the most important density function. Suppose the
average SAT score is 500; and the standard deviation (defined below--it measures
the spread around the average) is 200: Then the normal distribution of grades has

p.x/ D 1 e¡.x¡500/2=2.200/2 for ¡ x :

         200 2

This is the normal (or Gaussian) distribution with mean 500 and standard deviation
200: The graph of p.x/ is the famous bell-shaped curve in Figure 8.12.

  A new objection is possible. The actual scores are between 200 and 800, while the

density p.x/ extends all the way from ¡ to : I think the Educational Testing Ser-

vice counts all scores over 800 as 800: The fraction of such scores is pretty small--in

fact the normal distribution gives

     Regrettably, e¡x2 has no elementary antiderivative. We need numerical integration.

     But there is nothing the matter with that! The integral is called the "error function,"

     and special tables give its value to great accuracy. The integral of e¡x2=2 from ¡

     to is exactly 2: Then division by 2 keeps p.x/ dx D 1:
       Notice that the normal distribution involves two parameters. They are the mean

     value (in this case  D 500) and the standard deviation (in this case  D 200). Those
     numbers mu and sigma are often given the "normalized" values  D 0 and  D 1:

     p.x/ D 1 e¡.x¡/2=22                                   becomes         p.x/ D         1 e¡e2=2:

     The bell-shaped graph of p is symmetric around the middle point x D : The width
     of the graph is governed by the second parameter  --which stretches the x axis and
     shrinks the y axis (leaving total area equal to 1). The axes are labeled to show the
     standard case  D 0;  D 1 and also the graph for any other  and :

      We now give a name to the integral of p.x/: The limits will be ¡ and x, so the

     integral F .x/ measures the probability that a random sample is below x:

       Figure 8.12b shows the integral of the bell-shaped normal distribution. The middle

     point x D  has F D 21 : By symmetry there is a 50 ¡ 50 chance of an outcome below
     the mean. The cumulative density F .x/ is near :l6 at  ¡  and near :84 at  C :
     The chance of falling in between is :84 ¡ :16 D :68: Thus 68% of the outcomes are

     less than one deviation  away from the center :

      Moving out to  ¡ 2 and  C 2 , 95% of the area is in between. With 95%

     confidence X is less than two deviations from the mean. Only one sample in 20

     is further out (less than one in 40 on each side).

       Note that  D 200 is not the precise value for the SAT!

  For continuous probability, the sum  D  npn changes to  D xp.x/ dx:
We multiply outcome x by probability p.x/ and integrate. In the VCR model,

  Together with the meanwe introduce the variance. It is always written  2, and in
the normal distribution that measured the "width" of the curve. When  2 was 2002,
SAT scores spread out pretty far. If the testing service changed to  2 D 12, the scores

would be a disaster. 95% of them would be within ¨2 of the mean. When a teacher

announces an average grade of 72, the variance should also be announced--if it is big

then those with 60 can relax. At least they have company.

               THE LAW OF AVERAGESAND THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM

     We come to the center of probability theory (without intending to give proofs). The
     key idea is to repeat an experiment many times--poll many voters, or toss many
     dice, or play considerable poker. Each independent experiment produces an outcome
     X , and the average from N experiments is XN : It is called "X bar":

                            N X1 C X2 C ¤ ¤ ¤C XN        D average outcome:
                            XD                 N

     All we know about p.x/ is its mean  and variance  2: It is amazing how much
     information that gives about the average XN :

     8F Law of Averages: XN is almost sure to approach  as N                 :
               Central Limit Theorem: The probability density pN .x/ for XN approaches
               a normal distribution with the same mean  and variance  2=N:

     No matter what the probabilities for X , the probabilities for XN move toward the
     normal bell-shaped curve. The standard deviation is close to = N when the
     experiment is repeated N times. In the Law of Averages, "almost sure" means that
     the chance of XN not approaching  is zero. It can happen, but it won't.

     Remark 1 The Boston Globe doesn't understand the Law of Averages. I quote
     from September 1988 W "What would happen if a giant Red Sox slump arrived ?
     What would happen if the fabled Law of Averages came into play, reversing all those
     can't miss decisions during the winning streak ? " They think the Law of Averages
     evens everything up, favoring heads after a series of tails. See Problem 20:

     EXAMPLE 7 Yes-no poll of N D 2500 voters. Is a 53% ¡ 47% outcome

     conclusive ?

     The fraction p of "yes" voters in the whole population is not known. That is the
     reason for the poll. The deviation  D p.1 ¡ p/ is also not known, but for one voter
                                  1               1
     this  is  never  more  than  2  (when  p  D  2  ).  Therefore  =  N for 2500 voters is no larger

     than 21 = 2500, which is 1%:
     The result of the poll was XN D 53%: With 95% confidence, this sample is within

     two standard deviations (here 2%) of its mean. Therefore with 95% confidence, the

     unknown mean  D p of the whole population is between 51% and 55%. This

     poll is conclusive.

     If the true mean had been p D 50%, the poll would have had only a :0013 chance

     of reaching 53%: The error margin on each side of a poll is amazingly simple; it is

     always 1= N :

     Remark 2 The New York Times has better mathematicians than the Globe. Two
     days after Bush defeated Dukakis, their poll of N D 11; 645 voters was printed with
     the following explanation. "In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 [there is 95%] the results
     should differ by no more than one percentage point [there is 1= N ] from what would
     have been obtained by seeking out all voters in the United States."

     EXAMPLE 8 Football players at Caltech (if any) have average weight  D 210
     pounds and standard deviation  D 30 pounds. Are N D 16 players safe on an
     elevator with capacity 3600 pounds ? 16 times 210 is 3360:
                                                            8.4 Probability and Calculus                                                                                         397

                       The average weight XN is approximately a normal random variable with N D 210 and
                       N D 30= N D 30=4: There is only a 2% chance that XN is above N C 2N D 225 (see
                       Figure 8.12b--weights below the mean are no problem on an elevator). Since 16
                       times 225 is 3600, a statistician would have 98% confidence that the elevator is safe.
                       This is an example where 98% is not good enough--I wouldn't get on.

                       EXAMPLE 9 (The famous Weldon Dice) Weldon threw 12 dice 26; 306 times and

                       counted the 5's and 6's. They came up in 33:77% of the 315; 672 separate rolls. Thus
                       XN                                                                 1
                           D   :3377        instead  of  the  expected  fraction    p  D  3  of  5's    and    6's.     Were       the         dice  fair  ?

                       The variance in each roll is  2 D p.1 ¡ p/ D 2=9: The standard deviation of XN is

                       N D = N D 2=9= 315672 :00084: For fair dice, there is a 95% chance that
                       XN                            1                                                                                                     XN
                           will      differ    from  3  by  less  than  2N :  (For  Poisson   probabilities          that      is  false.            Here

                       is normal.) But :3377 differs from :3333 by more than 5N : The chance of falling 5

                       standard deviations away from the mean is only about 1 in 10; 000:

                           So the dice were unfair. The faces with 5 or 6 indentations were lighter than the

                       others, and a little more likely to come up. Modern dice are made to compensate for

                       that, but Weldon never tried again.

                                                                        8.4 EXERCISES

                    8.5 Masses and Moments

This chapter concludes with two sections related to engineering and physics. Each
application starts with a finite number of masses or forces. Their sum is the total
mass or total force. Then comes the "continuous case," in which the mass is spread
out instead of lumped. Its distribution is given by a density function  (Greek rho),
and the sum changes to an integral.

  The first step (hardest step ? ) is to get the physical quantities straight. The second
step is to move from sums to integrals (discrete to continuous, lumped to distributed).
By now we hardly stop to think about it--although this is the key idea of integral
calculus. The third step is to evaluate the integrals. For that we can use substitution or
integration by parts or tables or a computer.

  Figure 8.13 shows the one-dimensional case: masses along the x axis. The total
mass is the sum of the masses. The new idea is that of moments--when the mass or
force is multiplied by a distance:

    moment of mass around the y axis D mx D(mass) times (distance to axis):

Fig. 8.13 The center of mass is at xN D (total moment)=(total mass)D average distance.

  The figure has masses 1; 3; 2. The total mass is 6. The "lever arms" or "moment
arms" are the distances x D 1; 3; 7. The masses have moments 1 and 9 and 14 (since
mx is 2 times 7). The total moment is 1 C 9 C 14 D 24. Then the balance point is at
xN D Mx=M D 24=6 D 4.

  The total mass is the sum of the m's. The total moment is the sum of mn times
xn (negative on the other side of x D 0). If the masses are children on a seesaw, the
balance point is the center of gravity xN --also called the center of mass:

            P
               mnxn total moment
DEFINITION  xN D P D               :                          (1)
            mn        total mass

If all masses are moved to xN , the total moment (6 times 4) is still 24: The moment
                  P

equals the mass mn times xN . The masses act like a single mass at xN .
  Also: If we move the axis to xN , and leave the children where they are, the seesaw

balances. The masses on the left of xN D 4 will offset the mass on the right. Reason:

The distances to the new axis are xn ¡ xN . The moments add to zero by equation .1/:

   moment around new axis D X mn.xn ¡ xN / D Xmnxn ¡ X mnxN D 0:

Turn now to the continuous case, when mass is spread out along the line. Each

piece of length x has an average density n D .mass of piece//.length of piece/ D

m=x. As the pieces get shorter, this approaches d m=dx--the density at the point.

The limit of (small mass)=(small length) is the density .x/.

                                                                               P
Integrating that derivative  D d m=dx, we recover the total mass: nx be-

comes

            total mass M D .x/dx:                             (2)

When the mass is spread evenly,  is constant. Then M D L D density times length.
400                  8 Applications of the Integral

       The moment formula is similar. For each piece, the moment is mass nx
     multiplied by distance x--and we add. In the continuous limit, .x/dx is multiplied
     by x and we integrate:

                 total moment around y axis D My D x.x/ dx:                   (3)

     Moment is mass times distance. Dividing by the total mass M gives "average

     distance":

                 center of mass xN D moment D My D x.x/ dx : (4)
                               mass M        .x/ dx

     Remark If you studied Section 8:4 on probability, you will notice how the formulas
     match up. The mass .x/ dx is like the total probability p.x/ dx. The moment

      x.x/ dx is like the mean xp.x/ dx. The moment of inertia .x ¡ xN /2.x/ dx

     is the variance. Mathematics keeps hammering away at the same basic ideas! The only

     difference is that the total probability is always 1: The mean really corresponds to the
     center of mass xN , but in probability we didn't notice the division by p.x/dx D 1.

     EXAMPLE 1   With constant density  from 0 to L, the mass is M D L. The
     moment is           My D 0L x dx D 21 x 0 2L D 21 L2:

     The center of mass is xN D My=M D L=2. It is halfway along.

     EXAMPLE 2 With density e¡x the mass is 1, the moment is 1, and xN is 1:

     0 e¡x dx D ¡e¡x0 D 1 and 0 xe¡x dx D ¡xe¡x ¡ e¡x0 D 1:

                          MASSES AND MOMENTS IN TWO DIMENSIONS

     Instead of placing masses along the x axis, suppose m1 is at the point .x1; y1/ in the
     plane. Similarly mn is at .xn; yn/. Now there are two moments to consider. Around
     the y axis My D  mnxn and around the x axis Mx D  mnyn. Please notice that
     the x's go into the moment My--because the x coordinate gives the distance from
     the y axis!

       Around the x axis, the distance is y and the moment is Mx. The center of mass is
     the point .xN ; yN/ at which everything balances:

                 My  P   mnxn            Mx  P       mnyn

                 xN D D P      and yN D D P :                                 (5)
                 M         mn            M                        mn

       In the continuous case these sums become two-dimensional integrals. The total
     mass is .x; y/dx dy, when the density is  Dmass per unit area. These "double
     integrals" are for the future (Section 14:1). Here we consider the most important
     case:  D constant. Think of a thin plate, made of material with constant density (say
      D 1). To compute its mass and moments, the plate is cut into strips Figure 8.14:

                 mass M D area of plate                                       (6)

        Fig. 8.14 Plates cut into strips to compute masses and moments and centroids.

The mass equals the area because  D 1. For moments, all points in a vertical strip
are the same distance from the y axis. That distance is x. The moment is x times
area, or x times length times dx--and the integral accounts for all strips.

  Similarly the x-moment of a horizontal strip is y times strip length times dy.

The "center of mass" has xN DMy=M D2=3 and yN DMx=M D4=3. This is the cen-
troid of the triangle (and also the "center of gravity"). With  D 1 these terms all refer
to the same balance point .xN ; yN/. The plate will not tip over, if it rests on that point.

EXAMPLE 4 Find My and Mx for the half-circle below x2 C y2 D r2.
My D 0 because the region is symmetric--Figure 8.14 balances on the y axis. In the

Divide by the mass (the area 12  r2) to find the height of the centroid: yN D Mx=M D
4r=3.This is less than 21 r because the bottom of the semicircle is wider than the top.

                                      MOMENT OF INERTIA

The moment of inertia comes from multiplying each mass by the square of its
distance from the axis. Around the y axis, the distance is x. Around the origin, it is r:

               Iy D  xn2mn and Ix D  yn2mn and I0 D  rn2mn:

Notice  that   Ix C Iy     D I0    because     x2   C  y2   D  rn2.  In  the  continuous  case        we    inte-

grate.
402  8 Applications of the Integral

       The moment of inertia around the y axis is Iy D x2.x; y/ dx dy. With
     a constant density  D 1, we again keep together the points on a strip. On a vertical
     strip they share the same x. On a horizontal strip they share y:

     Iy D .x2/ (vertical strip length) dx and Ix D .y2/ (horizontal strip length) dy:

     In engineering and physics, it is rotation that leads to the moment of inertia. Look at
     the energy of a mass m going around a circle of radius r. It has I0 D mr2.

     kinetic energy D 12 mv2 D 12 m.r!/2 D 12 I0!2:         (9)

     The angular velocity is ! (radians per second). The speed is v D r! (meters per
     second).

       An ice skater reduces I0 by putting her arms up instead of out. She stays close to
     the axis of rotation (r is small). Since her rotational energy 12 I0!2 does not change,
     ! increases as I0 decreases. Then she spins faster.

       Another example: It takes force to turn a revolving door. More correctly, it takes
     torque. The force is multiplied by distance from the turning axis: T D F x, so a push
     further out is more effective.

       To see the physics, replace Newton's law F D ma D m dv=dt by its rotational
     form: T D I d!=dt . Where F makes the mass move, the torque T makes it turn.
     Where m measures unwillingness to change speed, I measures unwillingness to change
     rotation.

     EXAMPLE 5 Find the moment of inertia of a rod about (a) its end and (b) its center.

     The distance x from the end of the rod goes from 0 to L. The distance from the center

     goes from ¡L=2 to L=2. Around the center, turning is easier because I is smaller:

     (a marble), and a hollow ball (not a pingpong ball) down a slope. Galileo dropped

Question 4 Find formulas for the velocity v and the finish time T .

To compute v, the key is that potential energy plus kinetic energy is practically
constant. Energy loss from rolling friction is very small. If the mass is m and the
vertical drop is h, the energy at the top (all potential) is mgh. The energy at the
bottom (all kinetic) has two parts: 12 mv2 from movement along the plane plus
12 I!2 from turning. Important fact: vD!r for a rolling cylinder or ball of radius r.

  Equate energies and set ! D v=r:

                                                                I
                        1 21 2 1 2
                        mgh D 2 mv C 2 I! D 2 mv 1 C mr2 : (11)

The ratio I =mr2 is critical. Call it J and solve .11/ for v2:

                        v2 D 2gh .smallerJ means larger velocity/: (12)
                              1CJ

The order of J 's, for different shapes and sizes, should decide the race. Apparently

the density doesn't matter, because it is a factor in both I and m--so it cancels in
J D I =mr2. A hollow cylinder has J D 1, which is the largest possible--all its mass

is at the full distance r from the axis. So the hollow cylinder should theoretically

come in last. This experiment was developed by Daniel Drucker.

 Problems 35 ¡ 37 find the other three J 's. Problem 40 finds the time T by integra-

tion. Your experiment will show how close this comes to the measured time.

406                    8 Applications of the Integral

                  8.6 Force, Work, and Energy

     Chapter 1 introduced derivatives df =dt and df =dx: The independent variable could
     be t or x. For velocity it was natural to use the letter t: This section is about two
     important physical quantities--force and work--for which x is the right choice.

       The basic formula is W D F x: Work equals force times distance moved (dis-
     tance in the direction of F ). With a force of 100 pounds on a car that moves 20 feet,
     the work is 2000 foot-pounds. If the car is rolling forward and you are pushing back-

     ward, the work is ¡2000 foot-pounds. If your force is only 80 pounds and the car

     doesn't move, the work is zero. In these examples the force is constant.
       W D F x is completely parallel to f D vt: When v is constant, we only need

     multiplication. It is a changing velocity that requires calculus. The integral v.t /dt

     adds up small multiplications over short times. For a changing force, we add up
     small pieces of work F dx over short distances:

     W D F x .constant force/ W D F .x/ dx .changing force/:

       In the first case we lift a suitcase weighing F D 30 pounds up x D 20 feet of stairs.
     The work is W D 600 foot-pounds. The suitcase doesn't get heavier as we go up--it

     only seems that way. Actually it gets lighter (we study gravity below).
       In the second case we stretch a spring, which needs more force as x increases.

     Hooke's law says that F .x/ D kx: The force is proportional to the stretching dis-
     tance x. Starting from x D 0; the work increases with the square of x:

                  F D kx and W D x0 kx dx D 12 kx2:                            (1)

     In metric units the force is measured in Newtons and the distance in meters. The unit
     of work is a Newton-meter (a joule). The 600 foot-pounds for an American suitcase
     would have been about 800 joules in France.

     EXAMPLE 1 Suppose a force of F D 20 pounds stretches a spring 1 foot.

     (a) Find k: The elastic constant is k D F=x D 20 pounds per foot.

     (b) Find W:  The  work  is  12 kx2  D  1  ¤ 20 ¤ 12  D  10  foot-pounds.
                                            2

     (c) Find x when F D ¡10 pounds. This is compression not stretching: x D ¡ 12

     foot.

       Compressing the same spring through the same distance requires the same work.
     For compression x and F are negative. But the work W D 12 kx2 is still positive.
     Please note that W does not equal kx times xS That is the whole point of variable
     force (change F x to F .x/ dx).

       May I add another important quantity from physics ? It comes from looking at the
     situation from the viewpoint of the spring. In its natural position, the spring rests
     comfortably. It feels no strain and has no energy. Tension or compression gives it
     potential energy. More stretching or more compression means more energy. The
     change in energy equals the work. The potential energy of the suitcase increases by
     600 foot-pounds, when it is lifted 20 feet.

       Write V .x/ for the potential energy. Here x is the height of the suitcase or the ex-
     tension of the spring. In moving from x D a to x D b; work D increase in potential:

                      W D ab F .x/ dx D V .b/ ¡ V .a/: (2)

     This is absolutely beautiful. The work W is the definite integral. The potential V is
     the indefinite integral. If we carry the suitcase up the stairs and back down, our total
   8.6 Force, Work, and Energy                                                             407

work is zero. We may feel tired, but the trip down should have given back our energy.

(It was in the suitcase.) Starting with a spring that is compressed one foot, and ending
with the spring extended one foot, again we have done no work. V D 12 kx2 is the

same for x D ¡1 and x D 1: But an extension from x D 1 to x D 3 requires work:

W  D change  in V  D  1  k  .  3  /  2  ¡  12 k.1/2:
                      2

  Indefinite integrals like V come with a property that we know well. They include
an arbitrary constant C . The correct potential is not simply 12 kx2; it is 12 kx2 C C:
To compute a change in potential, we don't need C: The constant cancels. But to
determine V itself, we have to choose C . By fixing V D 0 at one point, the potential
is determined at all other points. A common choice is V D 0 at x D 0: Sometimes
V D 0 at x D (for gravity). Electric fields can be "grounded" at any point.

  There is another connection between the potential V and the force F: According
to (2), V is the indefinite integral of F: Therefore F .x/ is the derivative of V .x/:

The fundamental theorem of calculus is also fundamental to physics:

force exerted on spring W F D d V =dx                   (3a)

force exerted by spring W F D ¡d V =dx                  (3b)

Those lines say the same thing. One is our force pulling on the spring, the other
is the "restoring force" pulling back. (3a) and (3b) are a warning that the sign of
F depends on the point of view. Electrical engineers and physicists use the minus
sign. In mechanics the plus sign is more common. It is one of the ironies of fate that

F D V ½; while distance and velocity have those letters reversed: v D f ½: Note the

change to capital letters and the change to x:

EXAMPLE 2 Newton's law of gravitation (inverse square law):

force to overcome gravity D GM m=x2 force exerted by gravity D ¡GM m=x2

An engine pushes a rocket forward. Gravity pulls it back. The gravitational constant
is G and the Earth's mass is M: The mass of the rocket or satellite or suitcase is m;
and the potential is the indefinite integral:

V .x/ D F .x/ dx D ¡GM m=x C C:                                                       (4)

Usually C D 0; which makes the potential zero at x D :

was regarded as constant--which it nearly is. But an exact calculation of work uses
the integral of F .x/; not just the multiplication 30 times 20: The serious difference
comes when the suitcase is carried to x D : With constant force that requires infinite
work. With the correct (decreasing) force, the work equals V at infinity (which is zero)
minus V at the pickup point x0: The change in V is W D GM m=x0:

                                                KINETIC ENERGY

     This optional paragraph carries the physics one step further. Suppose you release the
     spring or drop the suitcase. The external force changes to F D 0: But the internal
     force still acts on the spring, and gravity still acts on the suitcase. They both start
     moving. The potential energy of the suitcase is converted to kinetic energy, until it
     hits the bottom of the stairs.

       Time enters the problem, either through Newton's law or Einstein's:

     .Newton/ F D ma D m dv .Einstein/ F D d .mv/: (5)
                                  dt                             dt

     Here we stay with Newton, and pretend the mass is constant. Exercise 21 follows

     Einstein; the mass increases with velocity. There m D m0= 1 ¡ v2=c2 goes to

     infinity as v approaches c; the speed of light. That correction comes from the

     theory of relativity, and is not needed for suit-cases.

       What happens as the suitcase falls ? From x D a at the top of the stairs to x D b
     at the bottom, potential energy is lost. But kinetic energy 12 mv2 is gained, as we see
     from integrating Newton's law:

           force F D m dv D m dv dx D mv dv
                            dt dx dt                    dx

     ÷ b ÷ b work F dx D mv dv dx D 1 mv2.b/ ¡ 1 mv2.a/: (6)
           a                a dx                 2          2

     This same force F is given by ¡d V =dx: So the work is also the change in V :

           ÷ b ÷ b  work F dx D ¡ d V  dx D ¡V .b/ C V .a/: (7)
              a             a dx

     Since (6) D (7), the total energy 12 mv2 C V (kinetic plus potential) is constant:

                 1  mv2.b/  C  V  .b/  D  1  mv2.a/  C  V  .a/:                          (8)
                 2                        2

     This is the law of conservation of energy. The total energy is conserved.

     EXAMPLE 3 Attach a mass m to the end of a stretched spring and let go. The

     spring's
     energy V D 12 kx2 is gradually converted to kinetic energy of the mass. At x D 0 the
     change to kinetic energy is complete: the original 12 kx2 has become 12 mv2: Beyond
     x D 0 the potential energy increases, the force reverses sign and pulls back, and

     kinetic energy is lost. Eventually all energy is potential--when the mass reaches the
     other extreme. It is simple harmonic motion, exactly as in Chapter 1 (where the mass
     was the shadow of a circling ball). The equation of motion is the statement that the
     rate of change of energy is zero (and we cancel v D dx=dt):

     d 1 2 1 2 dv dx d2x
            mv C kx D mv C kx D 0 or m 2 C kx D 0: (9)
     dt 2     2                dt            dt                  dt

     That is F D ma in disguise. For a spring, the solution x D cos k=m t will be found
     in this book. For more complicated structures, engineers spend a billion dollars a year
     computing the solution.

                           PRESSURE AND HYDROSTATIC FORCE

Our forces have been concentrated at a single points. That is not the case for
pressure. A fluid exerts a force all over the base and sides of its container. Suppose a
water tank or swimming pool has constant depth h (in meters or feet). The water has
weight-density w 9800 N=m3 62 lb=ft3: On the base, the pressure is w times h:
The force is wh times the base area A W

    F D whA (pounds or Newtons) p D F=A D wh.lb=ft2 or N=m2/: (10)

Thus pressure is force per unit area. Here p and F are computed by multiplication,
because the depth h is constant. Pressure is proportional to depth (as divers know).
Down the side wall, h varies and we need calculus.

  The pressure on the side is still wh--the same in all directions. We divide the side
into horizontal strips of thickness h. Geometry gives the length l.h/ at depth h
(Figure 8.17). The area of a strip is l.h/h: The pressure wh is nearly constant on
the strip--the depth only changes by h: The force on the strip is F D whlh.
Adding those forces, and narrowing the strips so that h 0; the total force

approaches an integral:

                                total force F D whl.h/ dh                               (11)

The side length is l D 60 when h D 0: The depth h increases from 0 to 20: The main

problem is to find l at an in-between depth h: With straight sides the relation is linear:

     Polar Coordinates and
       Complex Numbers

                             9.1 Polar Coordinates

     Up to now, points have been located by their x and y coordinates. But if you were

     a flight controller, and a plane appeared on the screen, you would not give its
     position that way. Instead of x and y, you would read off the direction of the plane
     and its distance. The direction is given by an angle : The distance is given by a
     positive number r: Those are the polar coordinates of the point, where x and y are
     the rectangular coordinates.

       The angle  is measured from the horizontal. Suppose the distance is 2 and

     the direction is 30¥ or =6 (degrees preferred by flight controllers, radians by

     mathematicians). A pilot looking along the x axis would give the plane's direction
     as "11 o'clock." This totally destroys our system of units, by measuring direction in

     hours. But the angle and the distance locate the plane.

      How far to a landing strip at r D 1 and  D ¡=2 ? For that question polar

     coordinates are not good. They are perfect for distance from the origin (which equals
     r), but for most other distances I would switch to x and y: It is extremely simple
     to determine x and y from r and  , and we will do it constantly. The most used
     formulas in this chapter come from Figure 9.1--where the right triangle has angle 
     and hypotenuse r: The sides of that triangle are x and y:

                             x D r cos  and y D r sin :     (1)

     The point at r D 2;  D =6 has x D 2 cos .=6/ and y D 2 sin.=6/: The cosine of
     =6 is 3=2 and the sine is 21 : So x D 3 and y D 1: Polar coordinates convert
     easily to xy coordinates--now we go the other way.

and keeps the same direction. Thus ¡=4 or ¡45¥ is the same angle as 7=4 or

315¥: So is 15=4 or 675¥:

 If we add or subtract 180¥, the tangent doesn't change. The point .1; ¡1/ is on the
¡45¥ line at r D 2: The point .¡1; 1/ is on the 135¥ line also with r D 2: Both
have tan  D ¡1: We had to write "almost" in equation (2), because a point has many

 's and two points have the same r and tan :

 Even worse, we could say that B D .1; ¡1/ is on the 135¥ line but at a negative
distance r D ¡ 2: A negative r carries the point backward along the 135¥ line,

which is forward to B: In giving the position of B, I would always keep r 0: But
in drawing the graph of a polar equation, r 0 is allowed. We move now to those
graphs.

                                    THE CIRCLE r D cos 
The basis for Chapters 1-8 was y D f .x/: The key to this chapter is r D F . /: That
is a relation between the polar coordinates, and the points satisfying an equation like
r D cos  produce a polar graph.

  It is not obvious why r D cos  gives a circle. The equations r D cos 2 and
r D cos2 and r D 1 C cos  produce entirely different graphs--not circles. The

direct approach is to take  D 0¥; 30¥; 60¥; : : : and go out the distance r D cos  on

each ray. The points are marked in Figure 9.2a, and connected into a curve. It seems
to be a circle of radius 21 , with its center at the point . 21 ; 0/: We have to be able to
show mathematically that r D cos  represents a shifted circle.

  One point must be mentioned. The angles from 0 to  give the whole circle. The
number r D cos  becomes negative after =2, and we go backwards along each ray.

         Fig. 9.2 The circle r D cos  and the switch to x and y: The circle r D sin :
414                                   9 Polar Coordinates and Complex Numbers

     At  D  (to the left of the origin) the cosine is ¡1: Going backwards brings us

     to the same point as  D 0 and r D C1--which completes the circle.

       When  continues from  to 2 we go around again. The polar equation gives the

     circle twice. (Or more times, when  continues past 2:) If you don't like negative

     r's and multiple circles, restrict  to the range from ¡=2 to =2: We still have to

     see why the graph of r D cos  is a circle.

     Method 5 Multiply by r and convert to rectangular coordinates x and y:

                                      r D cos                    r2 D r cos                x2 Cy2 D x:                          (3)

     This is a circle because of x2 C y2: From rewriting as .x ¡ 12 /2 C y2 D . 12 /2 we
                                                                               1                         21 :
     recognize                its  center    and  radius.    Center  at  x  D  2  and  y  D  0;  radius        Done.

     Method 6 Write x and y separately as functions of : Then  is a "parameter":

                                 x D r cos  D cos2 and y D r sin  D sin  cos :                                                  (4)

      These are not polar equations but parametric equations. The parameter  is the
     angle, but it could be the time--the curve would be the same. Chapter 12 studies

     parametric equations in detail--here we stay with the circle.
       To find the circle, square x and y and add. This produces x2 C y2 D x in Problem

     26: But here we do something new: Start with the circle and find equation (4). In

     case you don't reach Chapter 12, the idea is this. Add the vectors OC to the center
     and CP out the radius:

        The                point   P  in  Figure     9.2  has    .x; y/  D  OC  C CP      D  . 12 ; 0/ C . 12  cos  t;  1  sin  t /:
                                                                                                                        2

     The parameter t is the angle at the center of the circle. The equations are
                        1     1                      1
     x  D               2  C  2  cos  t  and  y   D  2  sin  t:  A  trigonometric  person    sees  a  double     angle     and  sets

     t D 2: The result is equation (4) for the circle:

                           x  D    1  C   1  cos  2  D    cos2           and      y  D  1  sin  2  D  sin        cos    :       (5)
                                   2      2                                             2

     This step rediscovers a basic theorem of geometry: The angle t at the center is twice
     the angle  at the circumference. End of quick introduction to parameters.

       A second circle is r D sin  , drawn in Figure 9.2c. A third circle is r D cos  C
     sin  , not drawn. Problem 27 asks you to find its xy equation and its radius. All
     calculations go back to x D r cos  and y D r sin  --the basic facts of polar
     coordinates! The last exercise shows a parametric equation with beautiful graphs,
     because it may be possible to draw them now. Then the next section concentrates on
     r D F . /--and goes far beyond circles.

                         9.2 Polar Equations and Graphs

     The most important equation in polar coordinates, by far, is r D 1: The angle  does

     not even appear. The equation looks too easy, but that is the point! The graph is a circle
     around the origin (the unit circle). Compare with the line x D 1: More important,

     compare the simplicity of r D 1 with the complexity of y D ¨ 1 ¡ x2: Circles are

     so common in applications that they created the need for polar coordinates.
       This section studies polar curves r D F . /: The cardioid is a sentimental favorite--

     maybe parabolas are more practical. The cardioid is r D 1 C cos ; the parabola is
     r D 1=.1 C cos  /: Section 12.2 adds cycloids and astroids. A graphics package can

     draw them and so can we.
       Together with the circles r D constant go the straight lines  D constant. The

     equation  D =4 is a ray out from the origin, at that fixed angle. If we allow r 0;

     as we do in drawing graphs, the one-directional ray changes to a full line. Important:
     The circles are perpendicular to the rays. We have "orthogonal coordinates"--

     more interesting than the x ¡ y grid of perpendicular lines. In principle x could be

     mixed with  (non-orthogonal), but in practice that never happens.

       Other curves are attractive in polar coordinates--we look first at five examples.
     Sometimes we switch back to x D r cos  and y D r sin ; to recognize the graph.

     EXAMPLE 1 The graph of r D 1= cos  is the straight line x D 1 (because r cos  D 1).

     EXAMPLE 2 The graph of r D cos 2 is the four-petal flower in Figure 9.3.

     The points at  D 30¥ and ¡30¥ and 150¥ and ¡150¥ are marked on the flower.
                                       1
     They  all  have  r  D  cos  2  D  2  :  There  are  three  important  symmetries--across  the

     x axis, across the y axis, and through the origin. This four-petal curve has them

     all. So does the vertical flower r D sin 2 --but surprisingly, the tests it passes are

     different.

     (Across the x axis: y to ¡y) There are two ways to cross. First, change  to ¡:
     The equation r D cos 2 stays the same. Second, change  to  ¡  and also r to
     ¡r: The equation r D sin 2 stays the same. Both flowers have x axis symmetry.

     (Across the y axis: x to ¡x) There are two ways to cross. First, change  to  ¡ :
     The equation r D cos 2 stays the same. Second, change  to ¡ and r to ¡r: Now

     r D sin 2 stays the same (the sine is odd). Both curves have y axis symmetry.

     (Through the origin) Now we change r to ¡r or  to  C : The flower equations

     pass the second test only: cos 2. C / D cos 2 and sin 2. C / D sin2: Every

     equation r2 D F . / passes the first test, since .¡r/2 D r2.

       The circle r D cos  has x axis symmetry, but not y or r: The spiral r D  3 has

     y axis symmetry, because ¡r D .¡ /3 is the same equation.

     Question What happens if you change r to ¡r and also change  to  C  ?
     Answer Nothing--because .r;  / and .¡r;  C / are always the same point.

     EXAMPLE 3 The graph of r D  is a spiral of Archimedes--or maybe two spi-
     rals.

     The spiral adds new points as  increases past 2: Our other examples are
     "periodic"-- D 2 gives the same point as  D 0: A periodic curve repeats itself.
     The spiral moves out by 2 each time it comes around. If we allow negative angles
     and negative r D ; a second spiral appears.

         Fig. 9.3 The four-petal flower r D cos 2 and the spiral r D  (r 0 in red).

EXAMPLE 4 The graph of r D 1 C cos  is a cardioid. It is drawn in Figure 9.4c.

The cardioid has no simple xy equation. Still the curve is very attractive. It has a
cusp at the origin and it is heart-shaped (hence its name). To draw it, plot r D 1 C

cos  at 30¥ intervals and connect the points. For this curve r is never negative, since

cos  never goes below ¡1:

  It is a curious fact that the electrical vector in your heart almost traces out a
cardioid. See Section 11.1 about electrocardiograms. If it is a perfect cardioid you
are in a little trouble.

     Fig. 9.4 Limaçons r D 1 C b cos ; including a cardioid and Mars seen from Earth.

EXAMPLE 5 The graph of r D 1 C b cos  is a limaçon (a cardioid when b D 1).

Limaçon (soft c) is a French word for snail--not so well known as escargot but just
as inedible. (I am only referring to the shell. Excusez-moi!) Figure 9.4 shows how a
dimple appears as b increases. Then an inner loop appears beyond b D 1 (the cardioid
at b D 1 is giving birth to a loop). For large b the curve looks more like two circles.
The limiting case is a double circle, when the inner loop is the same as the outer loop.
Remember that r D cos  goes around the circle twice.

  We could magnify the limaçon by a factor c; changing to r D c.1 C b cos  /: We

could rotate 180¥ to r D 1 ¡ b cos : But the real interest is whether these figures

arise in applications, and Donald Saari showed me a nice example.
418                    9 Polar Coordinates and Complex Numbers

     Mars seen from Earth The Earth goes around the Sun and so does Mars. Roughly
     speaking Mars is 1 21 times as far out, and completes its orbit in two Earth years.

       We take the orbits as circles: r D 2 for Earth and r D 3 for Mars. Those equations
     tell where but not when. With time as a parameter, the coordinates of Earth and Mars
     are given at every instant t :

         xE D 2 cos 2 t; yE D 2 sin 2 t and xM D 3 cos  t; yM D 3 sin  t:
     At t D 1 year, the Earth completes a circle (angle D 2) and Mars is halfway.

       Now the key step. Subtract to find the position of Mars relative to Earth:

        xM¡E D 3 cos  t ¡ 2 cos 2 t and yM¡E D 3 sin  t ¡ 2 sin 2 t:
     Replacing cos 2 t by 2 cos2 t ¡ 1 and sin 2 t by 2 sin  t cos  t; this is

      xM¡E D .3 ¡ 4 cos  t/ cos  t C 2 and yM¡E D .3 ¡ 4 cos  t/ sin  t:

     Seen from the Earth, Mars does a loop in the sky! There are two t 's for which

     3 ¡ 4 cos  t D 0 (or cos  t D 34 ). At both times, Mars is two units from Earth

     (xM¡E D 2 and yM¡E D 0). When we move the origin to that point, the 2 is

     subtracted away--the M ¡ E coordinates become x D r cos  t and y D r sin  t with
     r D 3 ¡ 4 cos  t: That is a limaçon with a loop, like Figure 9.4d.

     Note added in proof I didn't realize that a 3-to-2 ratio is also responsible for heating
     up two spots on opposite sides of Mercury. From the newspaper of June 13; 1990:

            "Astronomers today reported the first observations showing that Mercury
         has two extremely hot spots. That is because Mercury, the planet closest to the
         Sun, turns on its axis once every 59:6 days, which is a day on Mercury. It goes
         around the sun every 88 days, a Mercurian year. With this 3-to-2 ratio between
         spin and revolution, the Sun appears to stop in the sky and move backward,
         describing a loop over each of the hot spots."

                            CONIC SECTIONS IN POLAR COORDINATES

     The exercises include other polar curves, like lemniscates and 200-petal flowers. But
     get serious. The most important curves are the ellipse and parabola and hyperbola.
     In Section 3.5 their equations involved 1; x; y; x2; xy; y2: With one focus at the ori-
     gin, their polar equations are even better.

         circle if e D 0 ellipse if 0 e 1 parabola if e D 1 hyperbola if e 1:

     EXAMPLE 6 .e D 1/ The graph of r D 1=.1 C cos  / is a parabola. This equation

     is r C r cos  D 1 or r D 1 ¡ x: Squaring both sides gives x2 C y2 D 1 ¡ 2x C x2:
     Canceling x2 leaves y2 D 1 ¡ 2x; the parabola in Figure 9.5b.

       The amplifying factor A blows up all curves, with no change in shape.

     EXAMPLE 7 .e D 2/ The same steps lead from r.1 C 2 cos  / D 1 to r D 1 ¡ 2x:
     Squaring gives x2 C y2 D 1 ¡ 4x C 4x2 and the x2 terms do not cancel. Instead we
     have y2 ¡ 3x2 D 1 ¡ 4x: This is the hyperbola in Figure 9.5c, with a focus at .0; 0/:

      The hyperbola y2 ¡ 3x2 D 1 (without the ¡4x) has its center at .0; 0/.

Fig. 9.5 r D 1=.1 C e cos ) is an ellipse for e D 12 ; a parabola for e D 1; a hyperbola for
            e D 2.

The directrix The figure shows the line d (the "directrix") for each curve. All points
P on the curve satisfy r D PF D e P d : The distance to the focus is e times the
distance to the directrix. (e is still the eccentricity, nothing to do with exponentials.)
A geometer would start from this property r D e P d and construct the curve. We

derive the property from the equation:

                        rD A                              r C ex D A r D e A ¡  x : (1)
                             1 C e cos 
                                                                                          e

The directrix is the line at x D A=e: That last equation is exactly PF D e P d .

  Notice how two numbers determine these curves. Here the numbers are A and e: In
Section 3.5 they were a and b: (The ellipse was x2=a2 C y2=b2 D 1:) Using A and
e we go smoothly from ellipses through parabolas (at e D 1) and on to hyperbolas.

With three more numbers we can move the focus to any point and rotate the curve

through any angle. Conics are determined by five numbers.

      9.3 Slope, Length, and Area for Polar Curves

The previous sections introduced polar coordinates and polar equations and polar
graphs. There was no calculus! We now tackle the problems of area (integral calculus)
and slope (differential calculus), when the equation is r D F . /. The use of F instead
of f is a reminder that the slope is not dF=d and the area is not F . /d .

  Start with area. The region is always divided into small pieces--what is their
shape ? Look between the angles  and  C  in Figure 9.6a. Inside the curve is a
narrow wedge--almost a triangle, with  as its small angle. If the radius is constant

          Fig. 9.6 Area of a wedge and a circle and an intersection of circles.

the wedge is a sector of a circle. It is a piece of pie cut at the extremely narrow angle

 . The area of that piece is a fraction (the angle  divided by the whole angle 2)
of the whole area  r2 of the circle:

           area of wedge D   r2 D 1 r2 D 1 OEF . /2 : (1)
                                        2              2              2

We admit that the exact shape is not circular. The true radius F . / varies with  --
but in a narrow angle that variation is small. When we add up the wedges and let
 approach zero, the area becomes an integral.

9B The area inside the polar curve r DF . / is the limit of 2 P 1 r2 D 2 P 1 F 2 :

                                  ÷  12          ÷        1

EXAMPLE 1  Find        the  area  inside    the  circle  r  D  cos     of    radius  1  (Figure  9.6).
                                                                                     2

That  is  wrong!  The  correct    area  of  a  circle  of   radius  1    is  =4.  The   mistake  is  that
                                                                    2

=4.

     Where is the highest point on the cardioid r D 1 C cos  ? What is the slope at
      D =4 ? Those are not the most important questions in calculus, but still we should
     know how to answer them. I will describe the method quickly, by switching to
     rectangular coordinates:

        x D r cos  D .1 C cos  / cos  and y D r sin  D .1 C cos  / sin :

     For the highest point, maximize y by setting its derivative to zero:

     Thus  cos     C  cos  2   D  0,    which  happens  at    60¥.  The      height  is  y  D  .1    C  1  /.       3=2/.
                                                                                                        2

        For the slope, use the chain rule dy=d D .dy=dx/.dx=d /:

                      dy D dy=d D .1 C cos  /.cos  / C .¡ sin  /.sin  / : (4)
                      dx dx=d .1 C cos  /.¡ sin  / C .¡ sin  / cos 

     Equations (3) and (4) avoid the awkward (or impossible) step of eliminating  .
     Instead of trying to find y as a function of x, we keep x and y as functions of

      . At  D =4, the ratio in equation (4) yields dy=dx D ¡1=.1 C 2/.

       Problem 18 finds a general formula for the slope, using dy=dx D.dy=d /=.dx=d /.

     Problem 20 finds a more elegant formula, by looking at the question differently.

                                       LENGTH OF A POLAR CURVE

     The length integral always starts with ds D .dx/2 C .dy/2. A polar curve has
     x D r cos  D F . / cos  and y D F . / sin  . Now take derivatives by the product
     rule:

Squaring and adding (note cos2  C sin2  ) gives the element of length ds:                                             Fig. 9.7

The total arc length is ds.

  The area of a surface of revolution is 2y ds (around the x axis) or 2x ds
(around the y axis). Write x; y, and ds in terms of  and d . Then integrate.

EXAMPLE 4 The circle r D cos  has ds D 1 d . So its length is  (not 2!!--

don't go around twice). Revolved around the y axis the circle yields a doughnut with

no hole. Since x D r cos  D cos2  , the surface area of the doughnut is
                           ÷                                      ÷

                      9.4 Complex Numbers

Real numbers are sufficient for most of calculus. Starting from x2 C 4, its integral

13 x3 C 4x C C is also real. If we are given x3 ¡ 1, its derivative 3x2 is real. But the

roots (or zeros) of those polynomials are complex numbers:

        x2 C 4 D 0 and x3 ¡ 1 D 0 have complex solutions:

We expect two square roots of ¡4. There are three cube roots of 1. Complex numbers

are unavoidable, in order to find n roots for each polynomial of degree n.
  This section explains how to work with complex numbers. You will see their

relation to polar coordinates. At the end, we use them to solve differential equations.

 Start with the imaginary number i . Everybody knows that x2 D ¡1 has no real

solution. When you square a real number, the result is never negative. So the world has
agreed on a solution called i . (Except that electrical engineers call it j .) Imaginary
numbers follow the normal rules of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,

with one difference: Whenever i 2 appears it is replaced by ¡1. In particular ¡i
    ¡i gives Ci 2 D ¡1. In other words, ¡i is also a square root of ¡1. There are

times

two solutions .i and ¡i / to the equation x2 C 1 D 0.

  Finding cube roots of 1 will stretch us further. We need complex numbers--real
plus imaginary.

9B A complex number (say 1 C 3i ) is the sum of a real number .1/ and a pure
imaginary number .3i /. Addition keeps those parts separate; multiplication uses

i 2 D ¡1:

             Addition W .1 C 3i / C .1 C 3i / D 1 C 1 C i.3 C 3/ D 2 C 6i

    Multiplication W .1 C 3i /.1 C 3i / D 1 C 3i C 3i C 9i 2 D ¡8 C 6i:

Adding 1 C 3i to 5 ¡ i is easy .6 C 2i /. Multiplying is longer, but you see the rules:
             .1 C 3i/.5 ¡ i/ D 5 C 15i ¡ i ¡ 3i2 D 8 C 14i:

The point is this: We don't have to imagine any more new numbers. After accepting
i , the rest is straightforward. A real number is just a complex number with no

imaginary part! When 1 C 3i combines with its "complex conjugate" 1 ¡ 3i --adding

or multiplying--the answer is real:

          .1 C 3i /.1 ¡ 3i / D 1 ¡ 3i C 3i ¡ 9i 2 .1 C 3i / C .1 ¡ 3i /D 2 (real) D 10: (real) (1)

The complex conjugate offers a way to do division, by making the denominator real:

1 D 1 1 ¡ 3i D 1 ¡ 3i and  1 D 1 x ¡ iy D 2 2 x ¡ iy :
1 C 3i 1 C 3i 1 ¡ 3i 10    x C iy x C iy x ¡ iy x C y

9C The complex number x C iy has real part x and imaginary part y. Its

complex conjugate is x ¡ iy. The product .x C iy/.x ¡ iy/ equals x2 C y2 D r2.

The absolute value (or modulus) is r D x C iy D x2 C y2.

                                            THE COMPLEX PLANE

     Complex numbers correspond to points in a plane. The number 1 C 3i corre-
     sponds to the point .1; 3/. Similarly x C iy is paired with .x; y/--which is x units
     along the "real axis" and y units up the "imaginary axis." The ordinary plane turns
     into the complex plane. The absolute value r is the same as the polar coordinate r
     (Figure 9.8a).

       The figure shows two more copies of the complex plane. The one in the middle
     is for addition and subtraction. It uses rectangular coordinates. The one on the right
     is for multiplication and division and squaring. It uses polar coordinates. In squaring
     a complex number, r is squared and  is doubled--as the right figure and equation (3)
     both show.

     Fig. 9.8 The complex plane shows x, y, r, . Add with x and y, multiply with r and .

       Adding complex numbers is like adding vectors (Chapter 11). The real parts give

     3 ¡ 1 and the imaginary parts give 1 C 1. The vector sum .2; 2/ corresponds to the
     complex sum 2 C 2i . The complex conjugate 3 ¡ i is the mirror image across the real
     axis .i reversed to ¡i /. The connection to r and  is the same as before (you see it in

     the triangle):

         x D r cos  and y D r sin  so that x C iy D r.cos  C i sin  /: (2)

     In the third figure, 1 C i has r D 2 and  D =4. The polar form is 2 cos =4 C

       2i sin =4. When this number is squared, its 45¥ angle becomes 90¥: The square

     is .1 C i /2 D 1 C 2i ¡ 1 D 2i . Its polar form is 2 cos =2 C 2i sin =2.

     9D Multiplication adds angles, division subtracts angles, and squaring doubles
     angles. The absolute values are multiplied, divided, and squared:

     .r cos  C i r sin  /2 D r2 cos 2 C i r2 sin 2:  (3)

     For nth powers we reach rn and n . For square roots, r goes to r and  goes to

     12  . The number ¡1 is at 180¥, so its square root i is at 90¥.

       To see why  is doubled in equation (3), factor out r2 and multiply as usual:

          .cos  C i sin  /.cos  C i sin  / D cos2 ¡ sin2  C 2i sin  cos :

     The right side is cos 2 C i sin 2 . The double-angle formulas from trigonometry
     match the squaring of complex numbers. The cube would be cos 3 C i sin 3
     (because 2 and  add to 3 , and r is still 1). The nth power is in
     de Moivre's formula:

     .cos  C i sin  /n D cos n C i sin n:            (4)

With n D ¡1 we get cos.¡ / C i sin.¡ /--which is cos  ¡ i sin  , the complex

conjugate:

                        1 D 1 cos  ¡ i sin  D cos  ¡ i sin  : (5)

Squaring both sides gives .ei /.ei / D e2i . That is equation (3). The ¡1 power

is 1=ei D e¡i . That is equation (5). Multiplying any ei by ei produces ei.C/.

The special case  D  gives the square, and the special case  D ¡ gives ei e¡i D

1.
  Euler's formula appeared in Section 6.7, by changing x to i in the series for ex:

    ex D 1 C x C x C C 2 x3 ¤ ¤ ¤ becomes ei D 1 C i ¡ 2 ¡ i  C 3 ¤ ¤ ¤ :
                             26                                                        26

A highlight of Chapter 10 is to recognize two new series on the right. The real terms
1¡  1          ¤  ¤  ¤                                                  ¡  1           ¤  ¤  ¤
    2    2  C           add  up  to  cos  .  The  imaginary   part         6    3  C            adds  up  to  sin  .

Therefore ei equals cos  C i sin  . It is fantastic that the most important periodic

functions in all of mathematics come together in this graceful way.
  We learn from Euler (pronounced oiler) that e2i D 1. The cosine of 2 is 1, the

sine is zero. If you substitute x D 2 i into the infinite series, somehow everything

cancels except the 1--this is almost a miracle. From the viewpoint of angles,  D 2
carries us around a full circle and back to e2i D 1.

Multiplying Euler's formula by r, we have a third way to write a complex number:

         Every complex number is x C iy D r cos  C i r sin  D rei : (7)

EXAMPLE 1               2ei times 3ei equals 6e2i . For  D =2, 2i times 3i is ¡6.
EXAMPLE 2
                        Find w2 and w4 and w8 and w25 when w D ei=4.

Solution          ei=4 is 1=         2Ci=    2.   Note  that  r2  D  1  C  1  D    1.  Now         watch  angles:
                                                                     2     2

       w2 D ei=2 D i w4 D ei D ¡1 w8 D 1 w25 D w8w8w8w D w:

Figure 9.9 shows the eight powers of w. They are the eighth roots of 1.

                      Fig. 9.9 The eight powers of w and the cube roots of 1.

EXAMPLE 3 .x2 C 4 D 0/ The square roots of ¡4 are 2i and ¡2i . Instead of
.i /.i / D ¡1 we have .2i /.2i / D ¡4. If Euler insists, we write 2i and ¡2i as 2ei=2

and 2ei3=2.
428                    9 Polar Coordinates and Complex Numbers

     EXAMPLE 4 (The cube roots of 1) In rectangular coordinates we have to
     solve .x C iy/3 D 1, which is not easy. In polar coordinates this same equation is
     r3e3i D 1. Immediately r D 1. The angle  can be 2=3 or 4=3 or 6=3--the
     cube roots in the figure are evenly spaced:

            .e2i=3/3 D e2i D 1 .e4i=3/3 D e4i D 1 .e6i=3/3 D e6i D 1:

     You see why the angle 8=3 gives nothing new. It completes a full circle back to
     2=3.

             The nth roots of 1 are e2i=n, e4i=n, : : :, 1. There are n of them.
             They lie at angles 2=n, 4=n, : : :, 2 around the unit circle.

     SOLUTION OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

     The algebra of complex numbers is now applied to the calculus of complex functions.
     The complex number is c, the complex function is ect . It will solve the equations

     y¾ D ¡4y and y¿ D y, by connecting them to c2 D ¡4 and c3 D 1. Chapter 16 does

     the same for all linear differential equations with constant coefficients--this is an

     optional preview.
       Please memorize the one key idea: Substitute y D ect into the differential equa-

     tion and solve for c. Each derivative brings a factor c, so y½ D cect and y¾ D c2ect :

     d 2y=dt 2 D ¡4y leads to c2ect D ¡4ect ; which gives c2 D ¡4: (8)

     For this differential equation, c must be a square root of ¡4. We know the candidates
     .c D 2i and c D ¡2i /. The equation has two "pure exponential solutions" ect :

     y D e2it and y D e¡2it :                              (9)

     Their combinations y D Ae2it C Be¡2it give all solutions. In Chapter 16 we will

     choose the two numbers A and B to match two initial conditions at t D 0.
       The solution y D e2it D cos 2t C i sin 2t is complex. The differential equation is

     real. For real y's, take the real and imaginary parts of the complex solutions:

     yreal D cos 2t and yimaginary D sin 2t:               (10)

     These are the "pure oscillatory solutions." When y D e2it travels around the
     unit circle, its imaginary part sin 2t moves up and down. (It is like the ball and its
     shadow in Section 1.4, but twice as fast because of 2t .) The real part cos 2t goes

     backward and forward. By the chain rule, the second derivative of cos 2t is ¡4 cos 2t .
     Thus d 2y=dt 2 D ¡4y and we have real solutions.

     EXAMPLE 5 Find three solutions and then three real solutions to d 3y=dt 3 D y.

     Key step: Substitute y D ect . The result is c3ect D ect . Thus c3 D 1 and c is a cube
     root of 1. The candidate c D 1 gives y D et (our first solution). The next c is complex:

     c D e2i=3 D ¡ 1 C i 3 yields y D ect D e¡t=2ei 3t=2:  (11)
     22

     The real part of the exponent leads to the absolute value y D e¡t=2. It decreases

     as t gets larger, so y moves toward zero. At the same time, the factor ei 3t=2 goes

     around the unit circle. Therefore y spirals in to zero (Figure 9.10). So does its complex
                        9.4 Complex Numbers                                                 429

conjugate, which is the third exponential. Changing i to ¡i in (11) gives the third

cube root of 1 and the third solution e¡t=2e¡i 3t=2.

  The first real solution is y D et . The others are the two parts of the spiral:

                        yreal D e¡t=2 cos 3t =2 and yimaginary D e¡t=2 sin 3t =2:  (12)

That is r cos  and r sin  . It is the ultimate use (until Chapter 16) of polar coordinates
and complex numbers. We might have discovered cos 2t and sin 2t without help, for

y¾ D ¡4y. I don't think these solutions to y¿ D y would have been found.

EXAMPLE 6 Find four solutions to d 4y=dt 4 D y by substituting y D ect .

Four derivatives lead to c4 D 1. Therefore c is i or ¡1 or ¡i or 1. The solutions are

y D eit , e¡t , e¡it , and et . If we want real solutions, eit and e¡it combine into cos t
and sin t . In all cases y¾¾ D y.

Fig. 9.10 Solutions move in the complex plane: y¾ D ¡4y and y¿ D y and y¾¾ D y.

                                       CHAPTER 10

                                Infinite Series

Infinite series can be a pleasure (sometimes). They throw a beautiful light on sin x
and cos x. They give famous numbers like  and e. Usually they produce totally

unknown functions--which might be good. But on the painful side is the fact that

an infinite series has infinitely many terms.

  It is not easy to know the sum of those terms. More than that, it is not certain
that there is a sum. We need tests, to decide if the series converges. We also need
ideas, to discover what the series converges to. Here are examples of convergence,
divergence, and oscillation:

    1         C  1  C  1  C  ¤  ¤  ¤  D  2     1C1C1C¤¤¤D            1¡1C1¡1¤¤¤D<
                 2     4

The first series converges. Its next term is 1=8, after that is 1=16--and every step
brings us halfway to 2. The second series (the sum of 1's) obviously diverges to

infinity. The oscillating example (with 1's and ¡1's) also fails to converge.

  All those and more are special cases of one infinite series which is absolutely the

most important of all:

                 The geometric series is 1 C x C x2 C x3 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D 1 :
                                                     1¡x

This is a series of functions. It is a "power series." When we substitute numbers for

x, the series on the left may converge to the sum on the right. We need to know when
                                1                               ¡1:
it  doesn't.  Choose   x  D     2     and   x  D  1  and  x  D

    1 C 21 C 21 2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ is the convergent series. Its sum is 1 1 D 2
                                           1¡ 2

    1 C 1 C 1 C ¤ ¤ ¤ is divergent. Its sum is 1 D 1 D
                               1¡1 0

    1 C .¡1/ C .¡1/2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ is the oscillating series. Its sum should be 1 D 1 .
                                                    1 ¡.¡1/ 2

The last sum bounces between one and zero, so at least its average is 21 . At x D 2     431

there is no way that 1 C 2 C 4 C 8 C ¤ ¤ ¤ agrees with 1=.1 ¡ 2/.

  This behavior is typical of a power series--to converge in an interval of x's and to

diverge when x is large. The geometric series is safe for x between ¡1 and 1. Outside

that range it diverges.
432                                                  10 Infinite Series

     The next example shows a repeating decimal 1:111 : : ::

               Set x D 1 : The geometric series is 1 C 1  C 1 2  C 1 3 C ¤ ¤ ¤
                           10                                              10 10                10

     The decimal 1:111 : : : is also the fraction 1= 1 ¡ 101 , which is 10=9. Every

     fraction leads to a repeating decimal. Every repeating decimal adds up (through

     the geometric series) to a fraction.

       To get 3:333 : : :; just multiply by 3. This is 10=3. To get 1:0101 : : :; set x D 1=100.
                                        

     This is the fraction 1= 1 ¡ 1 100 , which is 100=99.

     Here is an unusual decimal (which eventually repeats). I don't really understand it:

                                 1 D :004 115 226 337 448 : : :
                               243
     Most numbers are not fractions (or repeating decimals). A good example is :

                    D3C 1 C 4 C 1 C 5 C¤¤¤:

                                      10 100 1000 10000

     This is 3:1415 : : :, a series that certainly converges. We happen to know the first
     billion terms (the billionth is given below). Nobody knows the 2 billionth term.
     Compare that series with this one, which also equals :

                                                D4¡4C4¡4C¤¤¤

                                                         357

     That alternating series is really remarkable. It is typical of this chapter, because its
     pattern is clear. We know the 2 billionth term (it has a minus sign). This is not a
     geometric series, but in Section 10.1 it comes from a geometric series.

     Question Does this series actually converge ? What if all signs are C ?
     Answer The alternating series converges to  (Section 10.3). The positive series
     diverges to infinity (Section 10.2). The terms go to zero, but their sum is infinite.

       This example begins to show what the chapter is about. Part of the subject deals
     with special series, adding to 10=9 or  or ex. The other part is about series in

     general, adding to numbers or functions that nobody has heard of. The situation was

     the same for integrals--they give famous answers like ln x or unknown answers like

      xx dx. The sum of 1 C 1=8 C 1=27 C ¤ ¤ ¤ is also unknown--although a lot of

     mathematicians have tried.

     The chapter is not long, but it is full. The last half studies power series. We begin

     with a linear approximation like 1 C x. Next is a quadratic approximation like
     1 C x C x2. In the end we match all the derivatives of f .x/. This is the "Taylor

     series," a new way to create functions--not by formulas or integrals but by infinite

     series.

      No example can be better than 1=.1 ¡ x/, which dominates Section 10.1. Then we

     define convergence and test for it. (Most tests are really comparisons with a geometric

     series.) The second most important series in mathematics is the exponential series¤¤¤
                        1         1
     ex  D  1  C  x  C  2  x2  C  6  x3  C           .  It  includes  the  series  for  sin  x  and  cos  x,  because  of

     the formula eix D cos x C i sin x. Finally a whole range of new and old functions

     will come from Taylor series.

     In the end, all the key functions of calculus appear as "infinite polynomials" (ex-

     10.1 The Geometric Series                                                             433

10.1 The Geometric Series

We begin by looking at both sides of the geometric series:

     1Cx Cx2Cx3C¤¤¤ D 1 :                                               (1)
                                                 1¡x
How does the series on the left produce the function on the right ? How does 1=.1 ¡

x/ produce the series ? Add up two terms of the series, then three terms, then n terms:

1 C x D 1 ¡ x 1 C x C x D 1 C 2 2 1 ¡ x3 ¤ ¤ ¤C xn¡1 D 1 ¡ x : (2) n
1¡x  1¡x                                                          1¡x

For the first, 1 C x times 1 ¡ x equals 1 ¡ x2 by ordinary algebra. The second
begins to make the point: 1 C x C x2 times 1 ¡ x gives 1 ¡ x C x ¡ x2 C x2 ¡ x3.
Between 1 at the start and ¡x3 at the end, everything cancels. The same happens in all
cases: 1 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C xn¡1 times 1 ¡ x leaves 1 at the start and ¡xn at the end. This proves

equation (2)--the sum of n terms of the series.

For the whole series we will push n towards infinity. On a graph you can see what

is happening. Figure 10.1 shows n D 1 and n D 2 and n D 3 and n D .

                                                 Fig. 10.1 Two terms, then three
                                                               terms, then full series:

                                                   1 Cx Cx2 C¤¤¤ D 1 1 ¡x .

                                                          1Cx Cx2 C¤¤¤
                                                   1¡x 1

                                                          1¡x

                                                                    x

                                                             x ¡x2

                                                                         x2

                                                                x2 ¡x3
                                                                    ¤¤¤

                                                 The infinite sum gives a finite

                                                 answer, provided x is between

                                                 ¡1 and 1. Then xn goes to

                                                 zero:

                                                            1¡xn    1
                                                            1¡x
                                                                  1¡x:

 Now start with the function 1=.1 ¡ x/. How does it produce the series ? One
way is elementary but brutal, to do "long division" of 1 ¡ x into 1 (next to the figure).
Another way is to look up the binomial formula for .1 ¡ x/¡1. That is cheating--

we want to discover the series, not just memorize it. The successful approach uses

calculus. Compute the derivatives of f .x/ D 1=.1 ¡ x/:

f ½ D .1 ¡ x/¡2 f ¾ D 2.1 ¡ x/¡3 f ¿ D 6.1 ¡ x/¡4 ¤ ¤ ¤                 (3)
434                                        10 Infinite Series

     At x D 0 these derivatives are 1, 2, 6, 24, : : :: Notice how ¡1 from the chain rule

     keeps them positive. The nth derivative at x D 0 is n factorial:

         f .0/ D 1 f ½.0/ D 1 f ¾.0/ D 2 f ¿.0/ D 6 ¤ ¤ ¤ f .n/.0/ D nS:
     Now comes the idea. To match the series with 1=.1 ¡ x/, match all those deriva-

     tives at x D 0. Each power xn gets one derivative right. Its derivatives at x D 0 are
     zero, except the nth derivative, which is n! By adding all powers we get every deriva-

     tive right--so the geometric series matches the function:

         1 C x C x2 C x3 C ¤ ¤ ¤has the same derivatives at x D 0 as 1=.1 ¡ x/:

     The linear approximation is 1 C x. Then comes 21 f ¾.0/x2 D x2. The third deriva-

     tive is supposed to be 6, and x3 is just what we need. Through its derivatives, the
     function produces the series.

       With that example, you have seen a part of this subject. The geometric series
     diverges if x 1. Otherwise it adds up to the function it comes from (when

     ¡1 x 1). To get familiar with other series, we now apply algebra or calculus--to
     reach the square of 1=.1 ¡ x/ or its derivative or its integral. The point is that these

     operations are applied to the series.

       The best I know is to show you eight operations that produce something useful.
     At the end we discover series for ln 2 and .

     1. Multiply the geometric series by a or ax:

               a C ax C ax2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D a ax C ax2 C ax3 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D ax : (4)
                                           1¡x                                        1¡x

     The first series fits the decimal 3:333 : : :: In that case a D 3. The geometric series for
           1
     x  D  10  gave  1:111 : : : D  10=9,  and  this  series  is  just  three  times  larger.  Its  sum  is  10=3.

        The second series fits other decimals that are fractions in disguise. To get 12=99,

     choose a D 12 and x D 1=100:

               :121212 : : : D 12 C 2 12 C 3 12 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D 12=100 D 12 :
                                    100 100 100                         1 ¡ 1=100 99

     Problem 13 asks about :8787 : : : and :123123 : : :: It is usual in precalculus to write

     a C ar C ar2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D a=.1 ¡ r/. But we use x instead of r to emphasize that this is

     a function--which we can now differentiate.

     2. The derivative of the geometric series 1 C x C x2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ is 1=.1 ¡ x/2:

                                                        d 1  1

                     1 C 2x C 3x dx 1 2 C 4x3 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D ¡ x D .1 ¡ x/2 : (5)

     At x D 110 the left side starts with 1:23456789. The right side is

     1=.1 ¡ 101 /2 D 1=.9=10/2, which is 100=81. If you have a calculator, divide 100 by

     81.
       The answer should also be near .1:11111111/2, which is 1:2345678987654321.

     3. Subtract 1 C x C x2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ from 1 C 2x C 3x2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ as you subtract functions:

                     x C 2x2 C 3x3 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D 2 1 D 1 D 2 x : (6)
                                      .1 ¡x/ .1 ¡x/ .1 ¡x/

     Curiously, the same series comes from multiplying .5/ by x. It answers a question left
     open in Section 8.4--the average number of coin tosses until the result is heads. This

     is the sum 1.p1/ C 2.p2/ C ¤ ¤ ¤ from probability, with x D 21 :
                               10.1 The Geometric Series                                    435

                        1 21  C 2 21 2 C 3 21 3 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D .1 ¡ 12 /2 2 D 2: (7) 1

The probability of waiting until the nth toss is pn D 21 n. The expected value is two
tosses. I suggested experiments, but now this mean value is exact.

4. Multiply series: the geometric series times itself is 1=.1 ¡ x/ squared:

             .1 Cx Cx2 C¤¤¤/.1 Cx Cx2 C¤¤¤/ D 1 C2x C3x2C¤¤¤ :                      (8)

The series on the right is not new! In equation (5) it was the derivative of

y D 1=.1 ¡ x/. Now it is the square of the same y. The geometric series satisfies

dy=dx D y2, so the function does too. We have stumbled onto a differential equation.

  Notice how the series was squared. A typical term in equation (8) is 3x2, coming
from 1 times x2 and x times x and x2 times 1 on the left side. It is a lot quicker

to square 1=.1 ¡ x/--but other series can be multiplied when we don't know what

functions they add up to.

5. Solve dy=dx D y2 from any starting value--a new application of series:

Suppose the starting value is y D 1 at x D 0. The equation y½ D y2 gives 12 for the
derivative. Now a key step: The derivative of the equation gives y¾ D 2yy½. At

x D 0 that is 2 ¤ 1 ¤ 1. Continuing upwards, the derivative of 2yy½ is 2yy¾ C 2.y½/2.

At x D 0 that is y¿ D 4 C 2 D 6.

All derivatives are factorials: 1; 2; 6; 24; : : :: We are matching the derivatives of the

geometric series 1 C x C x2 C x3 C : : : : Term by term, we rediscover the solution to
y½ D y2. The solution starting from y.0/ D 1 is y D 1=.1 ¡ x/.
A different starting value is ¡1. Then y½ D .¡1/2 D 1 as before. The chain rule
gives y¾ D 2yy½ D ¡2 and then y¿ D 6. With alternating signs to match these
derivatives, the solution starting from ¡1 is
                        y D ¡1 C x ¡ x2 C x3 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D ¡1=.1 C x/:
                                                                                    (9)

It is a small challenge to recognize the function on the right from the series on the

left. The series has ¡x in place of x; then multiply by ¡1. The sum y D¡1=.1 C x/

also satisfies y½ D y2. We can solve differential equations from all starting values

by infinite series. Essentially we substitute an unknown series into the equation, and

calculate one term at a time.

6. The integrals of 1 C x C x2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ and 1 ¡ x C x2 ¡ ¤ ¤ ¤ are logarithms:

                  x C 1 x2 C 1 x3 ÷ x C ¤ ¤ ¤ D dx D ¡ ln .1 ¡ x/                   (10a)
                           23                          0 1¡x                        (10b)

                  x ¡ 1 x2 C 1 x3 ÷ ¡ ¤ ¤ ¤ x D dx D C ln .1 C x/
                           23                          0 1Cx

The derivative of (10a) brings back the geometric series. For logarithms we find 1=n
not 1=n! The first term x and second term 12 x2 give linear and quadratic approxi-
mations. Now we have the whole series. I cannot fail to substitute 1 and 21 , to find
      ¡                                   ¡  1

436                                            10 Infinite Series

     The   first  series  diverges  to  infinity.    This   harmonic      series   1C  1  C   1  C¤¤¤  came  into
                                                                                       2      3

     the earliest discussion of limits (Section 2.6). The second series has alternating signs

     and converges to ln 2. The third has plus signs and also converges to ln 2. These will

     be examples for a major topic in infinite series-- tests for convergence.

         For the first time in this book we are able to compute a logarithm! Something

     remarkable is involved. The sums of numbers in .11/ and .12/ were discovered

     from the sums of functions in .10/. You might think it would be easier to deal only

     with numbers, to compute ln 2. But then we would never have integrated the series for
     1=.1 ¡ x/ and detected .10/. It is better to work with x, and substitute special values
           1
     like  2  at  the  end.

         There are two practical problems with these series. For ln 2 they converge slowly.

     For ln e they blow up. The correct answer is ln e D 1, but the series can't find it.

     Both problems are solved by adding (10a) to (10b), which cancels the even powers:

                   2 x C C C  x3 x5 ¤ ¤ ¤ D ln.1 C x/  ¡ ln.1 ¡ x/ D ln 1 C x : (13)
                                 35                                                           1¡x

     At  x D 13 ,  the    right  side  is  ln  4  ¡  ln  2  D  ln  2.  Powers  of  1  are  much    smaller   than
                                               3         3                         3
     powers of 1 or 21 , so ln 2 is quickly computed. All logarithms can be found from the
     improved series .13/.

     7. Change variables in the geometric series (replace x by x2 or ¡x2):

                                 1 C x2 C x4 C x6 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D 1=.1 ¡ x2/                                       (14)

                                 1 ¡ x2 C x4 ¡ x6 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D 1=.1 C x2/:                                      (15)

     This produces new functions (always our goal). They involve even powers of x. The
     second series will soon be used to calculate . Other changes are valuable:

                   x in place of x W 1 C x C C  x 2 ¤ ¤ ¤ D 1 D 2 (16)
                   2                              22                      1 ¡.x=2/ 2 ¡x

                    1 in place of x W 1 C 1 C 2 1 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D 1 D x : (17)
                   x                              xx                      1 ¡.1=x/ x ¡1

     Equation (17) is a series of negative powers x¡n. It converges when x is greater

     than 1. Convergence in .17/ is for large x. Convergence in .16/ is for x 2.

     8. The integral of 1 ¡ x2 C x4 ¡ x6 C ¤ ¤ ¤ yields the inverse tangent of x:

                                 13 15 17                              ÷  dx              ¡1

                          x ¡ 3 x C 5x ¡ 7 x C ¤ ¤ ¤ D 1 C x2 D tan x: (18)

     We integrated .15/ and got odd powers. The magical formula for  (discovered by
     Leibniz) comes when x D 1. The angle with tangent 1 is =4:

                                           1 ¡ 1 C 1 ¡ 1 C¤¤¤ D  : (19)
                                                  357                     4

     The first three terms give  3:47 (not very close). The 5000th term is still of size
     :0001, so the fourth decimal is still not settled. By changing to x D 1= 3, the
     astronomer Halley and his assistant found 71 correct digits of =6 (while waiting
     for the comet). That is one step in the long and amazing story of calculating . The
                                 10.1 The Geometric Series                                437

Chudnovsky brothers recently took the latest step with a supercomputer--they have

found more than one billion decimal places of  (see Science, June 1989). The dig-

its look completely random, as everyone expected. But so far we have no proof that
                         1
all  ten  digits  occur  10  of  the  time.

Historical note Archimedes located  above 3:14 and below 3 17 . Variations of his
method (polygons in circles) reached as far as 34 digits--but not for 1800 years. Then
Halley found 71 digits of =6 with equation (18). For faster convergence that series
was replaced by other inverse tangents, using smaller values of x:

                   D tan¡1 1 C tan¡1 1 D 4 tan¡1 1 ¡ tan¡1 1 : (20)
                  4                   2        3  5             239

A prodigy named Dase, who could multiply 100-digit numbers in his head in 8 hours,

finally passed 200 digits of . The climax of hand calculation came when Shanks
published 607 digits. I am sorry to say that only 527 were correct. (With years of

calculation he went on to 707 digits, but still only 527 were correct.) The mistake

was not noticed until 1945! Then Ferguson reached 808 digits with a desk calculator.
  Now comes the computer. Three days on an ENIAC .1949/ gave 2000 digits. A

hundred minutes on an IBM 704 .1958/ gave 10; 000 digits. Shanks (no relation)

reached 100; 000 digits. Finally a million digits were found in a day in 1973, with a
CDC 7600. All these calculations used variations of equation (20).

     The record after that went between Cray and Hitachi and now IBM. But the

method changed. The calculations rely on an incredibly accurate algorithm, based

on the "arithmetic-geometric mean iteration" of Gauss. It is also incredibly simple,

all things considered:

The number of correct digits more than doubles at every step. By n D 9 we are far
beyond Shanks (the hand calculator). No end is in sight. Almost anyone can go past
a billion digits, since with the Chudnovsky method we don't have to start over again.

  It is time to stop. You may think (or hope) that nothing more could possibly be

done with geometric series. We have gone a long way from 1=.1 ¡ x/, but some func-

tions can never be reached. One is ex (and its relatives sin x, cos x, sinh x, cosh x).

Another is 1 ¡ x (and its relatives 1= 1 ¡ x2, sin¡1 x, sec¡1 x, : : :). The expo-

nentials are in 10:4, with series that converge for all x. The square-roots are in 10:5,
closer to geometric series and converging for x 1. Before that we have to say what
convergence means.

  The series came fast, but I hope you see what can be done (subtract, multiply,
differentiate, integrate). Addition is easy, division is harder, all are legal. Some
unexpected numbers are the sums of infinite series.

Added in proof By e-mail I just learned that the record for  is back in Japan:
230 digits which is more than 1:07 billion. The elapsed time was 100 hours (75 hours
of CPU time on an NEC machine). The billionth digit after the decimal point is 9.

                      10.2 Convergence Tests: Positive Series

     This is the third time we have stopped the calculations to deal with the definitions.

     Chapter 2 said what a derivative is. Chapter 5 said what an integral is. Now we say

     what the sum of a series is--if it exists. In all three cases a limit is involved. That

     is the formal, careful, cautious part of mathematics, which decides if the active and

     progressive parts make sense.                                                                             C¤¤¤

         The  series   2    C   4  C  8            converges            to  1.  The   series   1C     2  C  3          diverges           to
                                        ¡             ¡  ¤  ¤  ¤
     infinity.    The  series        1      1  C   1                 converges        to  ln 2.  When          we  speak         about
                                            2      3
     convergence or divergence of a series, we are really speaking about convergence or

     divergence of its "partial sums."

     DEFINITION 1 The partial sum sn of the series a1 C a2 C a3 C ¤ ¤ ¤ stops at an:

                            sn D sum of the first n terms D a1 C a2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C an:

     Thus     sn  is  part  of  the  total  sum.      The      example          1  C  1  C  1  C¤¤¤      has  partial  sums
                                                                                2     4     8

                                     1                  3                     7           sn D 1 ¡ 2n 1 :
                               s1 D               s2 D                  s3 D

                                     2                  4                     8

     Those add up larger and larger parts of the series--what is the sum of the whole
     series ? The answer is: The series 12 C 14 C : : : converges to 1 because its partial
     sums sn converge to 1. The series a1 C a2 C a3 C : : : converges to s when its partial

     sums--going further and further out--approach this limit s. Add the a's, not the s's.

     DEFINITION 2 The sum of a series is the limit of its partial sums sn.

     We repeat: if the limit exists. The numbers sn may have no limit. When the partial
     sums jump around, the whole series has no sum. Then the series does not converge.
     When the partial sums approach s, the distant terms an are approaching zero. More
     than that, the sum of distant terms is approaching zero.

       The new idea . an D s/ has been converted to the old idea .sn s/.

     EXAMPLE 1              The    geometric       series         1     C    1     C    1   C¤¤¤   converges       to  s  D   91 .
                                                                  10        100       1000

     The  partial     sums  s1;    s2;   s3;   s4  are   :1;      :11;     :111;   :1111.      They   are   approaching       s  D        1  .
                                                                                                                                          9
     Note again the difference between the series of a's and the sequence of s's. The series
     1 C 1 C 1 C ¤ ¤ ¤ diverges because the sequence of s's is 1; 2; 3; : : :: A sharper example
                                               1      1        ¤  ¤  ¤                                                           1
     is  the  harmonic      series:      1  C  2  C   3  C              diverges      because    its  partial  sums       1;  1  2  ;  :  :  :

     eventually go past every number s: We saw that in 2:6 and will see it again here.

         Do not confuse an 0 with sn s: You cannot be sure that a series converges, just

     on the basis that an 0: The harmonic series is the best example: an D 1=n 0 but

     still sn : This makes infinite series into a delicate game, which mathematicians

     enjoy. The line between divergence and convergence is hard to find and easy to cross.

     A slight push will speed up an 0 and make the sn converge. Even though an 0

     does not by itself guarantee convergence, it is the first requirement:

         10A If a series converges .sn s/ then its terms must approach zero .an 0/:

     Proof Suppose sn approaches s (as required by convergence). Then also sn¡1

     approaches s, and the difference sn ¡ sn¡1 approaches zero. That difference is an:

     So an 0:

EXAMPLE 1 (continued) For the geometric series 1 C x C x2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ , the test an

0 is the same as xn 0: The test is failed if x 1, because the powers of x don't

go to zero. Automatically the series diverges. The test is passed if ¡1 x 1: But

to prove convergence, we cannot rely on an 0. It is the partial sums that must

converge:

       sn D 1 C x C ¤ ¤ ¤C xn¡1 D 1 ¡ x and sn n                                        1
                           1¡x
                                                                                      1 ¡ x : This is s:

  For other series, first check that an 0 (otherwise there is no chance of
convergence). The an will not have the special form xn--so we need sharper tests.

    The geometric series stays in our mind for this reason. Many convergence tests

are comparisons with that series. The right comparison gives enough information:

If a1          12 and a2    1   and   :  :  :  ;  then   a1  C  a2  C  :  :  :  converges         faster  than  1   C  1  C  :  :  :  :
                            4                                                                                   2      4

More generally, the terms in a1 C a2 C a3 C : : : may be smaller than ax C ax2 C
                                                                        P

ax3 C : : :: Provided x 1, the second series converges. Then an also converges.
We move now to convergence by comparison or divergence by comparison.

  Throughout the rest of this section, all numbers an are assumed positive.

                         COMPARISON TEST AND INTEGRAL TEST

In practice it is rare to compute the partial sums sn D a1 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C an: Usually a simple

formula can't be found. We may never know the exact limit s: But it is still possible
to decide convergence--whether there is a sum--by comparison with another series
that is known to converge.

                                                                       P
    10B (Comparison test) Suppose that 0 an bn and bn converges. Then
    P

       an converges.

                                                                P                        P
The smaller terms an add to a smaller sum: an is below bn and must converge.

                                                     P
On the other hand suppose an cn and cn D : This comparison forces

P
   an D : A series diverges if it is above another divergent series.

    Note that a series of positive terms can only diverge "to infinity." It cannot oscil-

late, because each term moves it forward. Either the sn creep up on s, passing every

number below it, or they pass all numbers and diverge. If an increasing sequence sn

is bounded above, it must converge. The line of real numbers is complete, and has

no holes.

84 :The comparison series diverges. The harmonic series, above it, must also diverge.

  To apply the comparison test, we need something to compare with. In Example 2,
we thought of another series. It was convenient because of those 12 's. But a different
series will need a different comparison, and where will it come from ? There is an
automatic way to think of a comparison series. It comes from the integral test.

  Allow me to apply the integral test to the same example. To understand the in-
tegral test, look at the areas in Figure 10.2. The test compares rectangles with

curved areas.
442                                10 Infinite Series

     Fig. 10.2 Integral test: Sums and integrals both diverge .p D 1/ and both converge .p 1/:

     EXAMPLE 2     (again)  Compare  1        C  1  C  1  C  :  :  :  with  the  area  under  the  curve  y  D  1=x  .
                                                 2     3

     Every term an D 1=n is the area of a rectangle. We are comparing it with a curved

     area cn: Both areas are between x D n and x D n C 1, and the rectangle is above

     the curve. So an cn:                                                      ÷ nC1 dx
                                           1     n exceeds curved area cn D x :

                 rectangular area an D
                                           n

     Here is the point. Those cn's look complicated, but we can add them up. The sum
     c1 C : : : C cn is the whole area, from 1 to n C 1: It equals ln.n C 1/--we know the
     integral of 1=x: We also know that the logarithm goes to infinity.

       The rectangular area 1 C 1=2 C : : :C 1=n is above the curved area. By comparison
     of areas, the harmonic series diverges to infinity--a little faster than ln.n C 1/:

     Remark The integral of 1=x has another advantage over the series with 12 's. First,
     the integral test was automatic. From 1=n in the series, we went to 1=x in the integral.
                                                                            1
     Second,  the  comparison  is  closer.  Instead    of  adding     only  2    when  the  number  of  terms

     is doubled, the true partial sums grow like ln n: To prove that, put rectangles under

     the curve.

     Rectangles below the curve give an area below the integral. Figure 10.2b omits the

     first rectangle, to get under the curve. Then we have the opposite to the first

     comparison--the sum is now smaller than the integral:

                               1C1 C¤¤¤C 1                 ÷ n dx
                               23                   n               D ln n:

                                                            1x

     Adding 1 to both sides, sn is below 1 C ln n. From the previous test, sn is above
     ln.n C 1/. That is a narrow space--we have an excellent estimate of sn: The sum

     of 1=n and the integral of 1=x diverge together. Problem 43 will show that the
     difference between sn and ln n approaches "Euler's constant," which is D :577 : : ::

       Main point: Rectangular area is sn: Curved area is close. We are using integrals to
     help with sums (it used to be the opposite).

     Question If a computer adds a million terms every second for a million years, how

     large is the partial sum of the harmonic series ?

     Answer The number of terms is n D 602 ¤ 24 ¤ 365 ¤ 1012 3:2 ¤ 1019: Therefore

     ln n is less than ln 3:2 C 19 ln 10 45: By the integral test sn 1 C ln n; the partial
     sum after a million years has not reached 46:

  For other series, 1=x changes to a different function y.x/: At x D n this function
must equal an: Also y.x/ must be decreasing. Then a rectangle of height an is above
the graph to the right of x D n, and below the graph to the left of x D n: The series
and the integral box each other in: left sum integral right sum. The rea-
soning is the same as it was for an D 1=n and y.x/ D 1=x: There is finite area in the
rectangles when there is finite area under the curve.

  When we can't add the a's, we integrate y.x/ and compare areas:

In Figure 10.2c, the area is finite if p 1: The integral equals x1¡p=.1 ¡ p/ 1  ;
which is 1=.p ¡ 1/: Finite area means convergent series. If 1=1p is the first term,

add 1 to the curved area:

The borderline case p D 1 is the harmonic series (divergent). By the comparison

test, every p 1 also produces divergence. Thus  1= n diverges by comparison

with dx= x (and also by comparison with  1=n). Section 7.5 on improper

integrals runs parallel to this section on "improper sums" (infinite series).

Euler  found         as  its  sum.  The  series  1  C  8  C  27  C           also  converges.  That  is

proved by comparing  1=n3 with  1=n2 or with dx=x3: But the sum for p D 3

is unknown.

Extra credit problem The sum of the p-series leads to the most important problem
in pure mathematics. The "zeta function" is Z.p/ D  1=np, so Z.2/ D 2=6 and

Z.3/ is unknown. Riemann studied the complex numbers p where Z.p/ D 0 (there
are infinitely many). He conjectured that the real part of those p is always 21 . That
has been tested for the first billion zeros, but never proved.

                      COMPARISON WITH THE GEOMETRIC SERIES

We can compare any new series a1 C a2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ with 1 C x C ¤ ¤ ¤ : Remember that the

first million terms have nothing to do with convergence. It is further out, as n ,
that the comparison stands or falls. We still assume that an 0:

  10D (Ratio test) If anC1=an approaches a limit L 1, the series converges.
  10E (Root test) If the nth root .an/1=n approaches L 1, the series converges.

Roughly speaking, these tests make an comparable with Ln--therefore convergent.
The tests also establish divergence if L 1: They give no decision when L D 1:
Unfortunately L D 1 is the most important and the hardest case.
444                   10 Infinite Series

       On the other hand, you will now see that the ratio test is fairly easy.

     EXAMPLE 4 The geometric series x C x2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ has ratio exactly x: The nth root

     is also exactly x: So L D x: There is convergence if x 1 (known) and divergence if

     x 1 (also known). The divergence of 1 C 1 C ¤ ¤ ¤ is too delicate (!) for the ratio test

     and root test, because L D 1:

     EXAMPLE 5 The p-series has an D 1=np and anC1=an D np=.n C 1/p: The limit

     as n        is L D 1, for every p: The ratio test does not feel the difference between
     p D 2 (convergence) and p D 1 (divergence) or even p D ¡1 (extreme divergence).

     Neither does the root test. So the integral test is sharper.

     EXAMPLE 6 A combination of p-series and geometric series can now be decided:

     1p x C 2p x C 2 ¤ ¤ ¤ C np x C n ¤ ¤ ¤ has ratio anC1 a D n .n C 1/p xn x approaching L D x: nC1 np

     It is x 1 that decides convergence, not p. The powers xn are stronger than
     any np. The factorials n! will now prove stronger than any xn:

     EXAMPLE 7   The  exponential  series  ex  D  1  C  x  C       1  x  2  C  1  x  3  C  ¤  ¤  ¤  converges
                                                                   2           6
     for all x:

     The terms of this series are xn=n! The ratio between neighboring terms is

                 xnC1=.n C 1/S x
                     xn=nS D n C 1 ; which approaches L D 0 as n :

     With x D 1, this ratio test gives convergence of P 1=nS The sum is e. With x D 4,
     the larger series P 4n=nS also converges. We know this sum too--it is e4: Also the
     sum of xnnp=nS converges for any x and p: Again L D 0--the ratio test is not even
     close. The factorials take over; and give convergence.

     Here is the proof of convergence when the ratios approach L 1. Choose x halfway
     from L to 1: Then x 1: Eventually the ratios go below x and stay below:

           aN C1=aN x aN C2=aN C1 x aN C3=aN C2 x ¤ ¤ ¤

     Multiply the first two inequalities. Then multiply all three:

            aN C1=aN x aN C2=aN x2 aN C3=aN x3 ¤ ¤ ¤

     Therefore aN C1 C aN C2 C aN C3 C ¤ ¤ ¤ is less than aN .x C x2 C x3 C ¤ ¤ ¤ /: Since

     x 1; comparison with the geometric series gives convergence.

     EXAMPLE 8 The series P 1=nn is ideal for the root test. The nth root is 1=n: Its
     limit is L D 0: Convergence is even faster than for e D P 1=nS The root test is easily
     explained, since .an/1=n x yields an xn and x is close to L 1: So we compare
     with the geometric series.

                                    SUMMARY FOR POSITIVE SERIES

     The convergence of geometric series and p-series and exponential series is settled.
     I will put these an's in a line, going from most divergent to most convergent.
            10.2 Convergence Tests: Positive Series                                       445

The crossover to convergence is after 1=n:

    .an = 0/                     10B and 10C           10D and 10E
                          (comparison and integral)
                                                      (ratio and root)

You should know that this crossover is not as sharp as it looks. On the convergent
side, 1=n.ln n/2 comes before all those p-series. On the divergent side, 1=n.ln n/
and 1=n.ln n/.ln ln n/ belong after 1=n: For any divergent (or convergent) series,
there is another that diverges (or converges) more slowly.

  Thus there is no hope of an ultimate all-purpose comparison test. But comparison is
the best method available. Every series in that line can be compared with its neighbors,
and other series can be placed in between. It is a topic that is understood best by
examples.

EXAMPLE 9   X1                              X1
ln n n:        ln n diverges because n diverges. The comparison uses

EXAMPLE 10  X1            ÷ dx                       X1   ÷ dx          D:
                             x.ln x/2
               n.ln n/2                               n.ln n/ x.ln x/

The indefinite integrals are ¡1= ln x and ln.ln x/: The first goes to zero as x ;

the integral and series both converge. The second integral ln.ln x/ goes to infinity--

very slowly but it gets there. So the second series diverges. These examples squeeze

new series into the line, closer to the crossover.

EXAMPLE 11 n2 C 1 n2 1 1 so 12 C 15 C 110 C ¤ ¤ ¤ 11 C 14 C 19 C ¤ ¤ ¤ (convergence).

The constant 1 in this denominator has no effect--and again in the next example.

                       1  1 so 1 C 1 C 1 C¤¤¤ 1 C 1 C 1 C¤¤¤ :
EXAMPLE 12
            2n¡1 2n 1 3 5                            246

P 1=2n is 1=2 times P 1=n, so both series diverge. Two series behave in the same

way if the ratios an=bn approach L 0. Examples 11 ¡ 12 have n2=.n2 C 1/ 1
and 2n=.2n ¡ 1/ 1: That leads to our final test:

10F (Limit comparison test) If the ratio an=bn approaches a positive limit L,

P           P
then an and bn either both diverge or both converge.

Reason: an is smaller than 2Lbn, and larger than 21 LbPn, at least when n is large.
So the two series behave in the same way. For example sin .7=np/ converges for
p 1, not for p 1: It behaves like P 1=np (here L D 7). The tail end of a series
(large n) controls convergence. The front end (small n) controls most of the sum.

  There are many more series to be investigated by comparison.

                           10.3 Convergence Tests: All Series

        ¡  1     1  ¡   1  C¤¤¤D        1                                                                              ¡     4           4  ¡  4
     1     2  C  4      8               3  is  certainly  allowed.         So    is  the      series       D        4        3     C     5     7  C
     ¤ ¤ ¤ . If we change all signs to C, the geometric series would still converge (to the

     larger sum 2). This is the first test, to bring back a positive series by taking the abso-

     lute value an of every term.

     DEFINITION The series  an is "absolutely convergent" if  an is convergent.

     Changing a negative number from an to an increases the sum. Main point: The
     smaller series  an is sure to converge if  an converges.

        10G If  an converges then  an converges (absolutely). But  an might con-
        verge, as in the series for , even if  an diverges to infinity.

     EXAMPLE 1                Start  with  the       positive  series  1   C     1  C      1  C¤¤¤.    Change                any         signs    to
                                                                       2         4         8
     minus. Then the new series converges (absolutely). The right choice of signs will
     make it converge to any number between ¡1 and 1.

     EXAMPLE 2                Start  with  the       alternating  series   1  ¡     1   C     1  ¡  1  C   ¤  ¤  ¤  which             converges
                                                                                    2         3     4
                                                                              1         1  C¤¤¤
     to  ln  2.  Change     to  plus  signs.      The   new    series  1C     2  C      3           diverges              to    infinity.      The

     original alternating series was not absolutely convergent. It was only "conditionally

     convergent." A series can converge (conditionally) by a careful choice of signs--even

     if  an D .

       If  an converges then  an converges. Here is a quick proof. The numbers
     an C an are either zero (if an is negative) or 2 an . By comparison with  2 an ,
     which converges, .an C an / must converge. Now subtract the convergent series
      an . The difference  an also converges, completing the proof. All tests for pos-
     itive series (integral, ratio, comparison, : : :) apply immediately to absolute conver-

     gence, because we switch to an .

     EXAMPLE 3                Start  with  the       geometric    series   1   C     1  C     1   C¤¤¤        which           converges           to
                                                                           3         9        27
     21 . Change any of those signs to minus. Then the new series must converge (abso-
     lutely). But the sign changes cannot achieve all sums between ¡ 12 and 21 . This time
     the sums belong to the famous (and very thin) Cantor set of Section 3.7.

     EXAMPLE 4 (looking ahead) Suppose  anxn converges for a particular number
     x. Then for every x nearer to zero, it converges absolutely. This will be proved and
     used in Section 10:6 on power series, where it is the most important step in the theory.

     EXAMPLE 5 Since  1=n2 converges, so does .cos n/=n2. That second series

     has irregular signs, but it converges absolutely by comparison with the first series

     does not stay bounded like the cosine.

to zero. Those two facts--decrease to zero with alternating signs--guarantee
convergence.

 10H An alternating series a1 ¡ a2 C a3 ¡ a4 ¤ ¤ ¤ converges (at least condition-

  ally, maybe not absolutely) if every anC1 an and an 0.

The best proof is in Figure 10.3. Look at a1 ¡ a2 C a3. It is below a1, because a3

(with plus sign) is smaller than a2 (with minus sign). The sum of five terms is less than
the

sum of three terms, because a5 is smaller than a4. These partial sums s1; s3; s5; : : :

with an odd number of terms are decreasing.

 Now look at two terms a1 ¡ a2, then four terms, then six terms. Adding on
a3 ¡ a4 increases the sum (because a3 a4). Similarly s6 is greater than s4 (because
it includes a5 ¡ a6 which is positive). So the sums s2; s4; s6; : : : are increasing.

 The difference between sn¡1 and sn is the single number ¨an. It is required by

10H to approach zero. Therefore the decreasing sequence s1; s3; : : : approaches the
same limit s as the increasing sequence s2; s4; : : : : The series converges to s, which

always lies between sn¡1 and sn.

  This plus-minus pattern is special but important. The positive series  an may not

converge. The alternating series is  .¡1/nC1an.

                        MULTIPLYING AND REARRANGING SERIES

In Section 10:1 we added and subtracted and multiplied series. Certainly addition and
subtraction are safe. If one series has partial sums sn s and the other has partial
sums tn t , then addition gives partial sums sn C tn s C t . But multiplication is
more dangerous, because the order of the multiplication can make a difference. More
exactly, the order of terms is important when the series are conditionally
convergent. For absolutely convergent series, the order makes no difference. We can
450                                                 10 Infinite Series

     rearrange their terms and multiply them in any order, and the sum and product comes
     out right:

     10I Suppose  an converges absolutely. If A1; A2; : : : is any reordering of the
     a's, then  An D  an. In the new order  An also converges absolutely.

     10J Suppose  an D s and  bn D t converges absolutely. Then the infinitely
     many terms ai bj in their product add (in any order) to st .

     Rather than proving 10I and 10J, we show what happens when there is only con-

     to ln 2. By rearranging, it will converge conditionally to anything! Suppose the de-¤¤¤

     sired              sum  is  1000.  Take  positive  terms     1  C  3  C           until       they  pass  1000.  Then  add
                                 ¡ 12   ¡     ¡¤¤¤
     negative           terms              1        until  the  subtotal   drops       below          1000.  Then  new  positive
                                           4
     terms bring it above 1000, and so on. All terms are eventually used, since at least one

     new term is needed at each step. The limit is s D 1000.

     We also get strange products, when series fail to converge absolutely:

     1 ¡ 1 C 1 ¤¤¤1 ¡ 1 C 1 ¤¤¤  D 1 ¡ 1 C 1   C 1 C 1 C 1 ¤¤¤ :
                        23                          23                                       22                    343

     On the left the series converge (conditionally). The alternating terms go to zero. On

     the right the series diverges. Its terms in parentheses don't even approach zero, and

     the product is completely wrong.

       I close by emphasizing that it is absolute convergence that matters. The most
     important series are power series  anxn. Like the geometric series (with all an D
     1) there is absolute convergence over an interval of x's. They give functions of x,

     which is what calculus needs and wants.
       We go next to the series for ex, which is absolutely convergent everywhere. From

     the viewpoint of convergence tests it is too easy--the danger is gone. But from the
     viewpoint of calculus and its applications, ex is unconditionally the best.

                10.4 The Taylor Series for ex, sin x, and cos x

     This section goes back from numbers to functions. Instead of  an D s it deals with
      anxn D f .x/: The sum is a function of x. The geometric series has all an D 1

     (including a0, the constant term) and its sum is f .x/ D 1=.1 ¡ x/: The derivatives
     of 1 C x C x2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ match the derivatives of f: Now we choose the an differently, to

     match a different function.
       The new function is ex: All its derivatives are ex: At x D 0, this function and its

     derivatives equal 1: To match these 1's, we move factorials into the denominators.

     Term by term the series is

     The same term-by-term idea works for differential equations, as follows.

     EXAMPLE 1 Solve dy=dx D ¡y starting from y D 1 at x D 0:

     Solution The zeroth derivative at x D 0 is the function itself : y D 1: Then the

     equation y½ D ¡y gives y½ D ¡1 and y¾ D ¡y½ D C1: The alternating derivatives
     1; ¡1; 1; ¡1; : : : are matched by the alternating series for e¡x:

            y   D  1  ¡x   C     1  x2  ¡  61 x3  C  ¤¤¤  D   e¡x   (the  correct  solution  to    y½  D  ¡y):
                                 2

     EXAMPLE 2 Solve d 2y=dx2 D ¡y starting from y D 1 and y½ D 0 (the answer

     is cos x).

     Solution The equation gives y¾ D ¡1 (again at x D 0). The derivative of the
     equation gives y¿ D ¡y½ D 0: Then y¾¾ D ¡y¾ D C1: The even derivatives are
     alternately C1 and ¡1, the odd derivatives are zero. This is matched by a series

     of even powers, which constructs cos x:

                                 y D 1 ¡ 1 x2 C 1 x4 ¡ 1 x6 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D cos x:

                                           2S 4S 6S

     The   first   terms   1  ¡  1  x2  came   earlier    in   the  book.   Now  we  have  the  whole     alternating
                                 2
     series. It converges absolutely for all x, by comparison with the series for ex (odd

     powers are dropped). The partial sums in Figure 10.4 reach further and further before

     they lose touch with cos x:

  If we wanted plus signs instead of plus-minus, we could average ex and e¡x: The

differential equation for cosh x is d 2y=dx2 D Cy, to give plus signs:

                                            TAYLOR SERIES

The idea of matching derivatives by powers is becoming central to this chapter. The

derivatives are given at a basepoint (say x D 0). They are numbers f .0/; f ½.0/; : : ::

The derivative f .n/.0/ will be the nth derivative of anxn, if we choose an to be
f .n/.0/=nS Then the series  anxn has the same derivatives at the basepoint as f .x/:

10K The Taylor series that matches f .x/ and all its derivatives at x D 0 is

f .0/ C f ½.0/x C 1 f ¾.0/x2 C 1 f ¿.0/x3 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D X f x : .n/.0/ n

The first terms give the linear and quadratic approximations that we know well. The
x3 term was mentioned earlier (but not used). Now we have all the terms--an "infinite
approximation" that is intended to equal f .x/:

  Two things are needed. First, the series must converge. Second, the function must
do what the series predicts, away from x D 0: Those are true for ex and cos x and
sin x; the series equals the function. We proceed on that basis.

  The Taylor series with special basepoint x D 0 is also called the "Maclaurin se-

ries."

¡ sin x; : : : at x D 0: Those values are 0; 1; 0; ¡1; 0; 1; : : :: All even derivatives are

zero. To find the coefficients in the Taylor series, divide by the factorials:

EXAMPLE 4 Find the Taylor series for f .x/ D .1 C x/5 around x D 0:

Solution This function starts at f .0/ D 1: Its derivative is 5.1 C x/4, so f ½.0/ D

5: The second derivative is 5 ¤ 4 ¤ .1 C x/3, so f ¾.0/ D 5 ¤ 4: The next three derivatives
are 5 ¤ 4 ¤ 3, 5 ¤ 4 ¤ 3 ¤ 2, 5 ¤ 4 ¤ 3 ¤ 2 ¤ 1: After that all derivatives are zero. Therefore the

Taylor series stops after the x5 term:

You may recognize 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1: They are the binomial coefficients, which ap-
pear in Pascal's triangle (Section 2.2). By matching derivatives, we see why 0S; 1S; 2S; : : :
are needed in the denominators.

There is no doubt that x D 0 is the nicest basepoint. But Taylor series can be
constructed around other points x D a: The principle is the same--match derivatives

by powers--but now the powers to use are .x ¡ a/n: The derivatives f .n/.a/ are

computed at the new basepoint x D a:

      The Taylor series begins with f .a/ C f ½.a/.x ¡ a/: This is the tangent

     approximation at x D a: The whole "infinite approximation" is centered at a--
     at that point it has the same derivatives as f .x/:

     EXAMPLE 5 Find the Taylor series for f .x/ D .1 C x/5 around x D a D 1:

     Solution At x D 1, the function is .1 C 1/5 D 32: Its first derivative 5.1 C x/4 is

     5 ¤ 16 D 80: We compute the nth derivative, divide by nS, and multiply by .x ¡ 1/n:

     That Taylor series (which stops at n D 5) should agree with .1 C x/5: It does. We

     could rewrite 1 C x as 2 C .x ¡ 1/, and take its fifth power directly. Then 32; 16; 8; 4;

     2; 1 will multiply the usual coefficients 1; 5; 10; 10; 5; 1 to give our Taylor coefficients
     32; 80; 80; 40; 10; 1: The series stops as it will stop for any polynomial--because the

     high derivatives are zero.

     EXAMPLE 6 Find the Taylor series for f .x/ D ex around the basepoint x D 1:

        DEFINING THE FUNCTION BY ITS SERIES

     Usually, we define sin x and cos x from the sides of a triangle. But we could start
     instead with the series. Define sin x by equation (2). The logic goes backward, but it
     is still correct:

     First, prove that the series converges.

     Second, prove properties like .sin x/½ D cos x:

     Third, connect the definitions by series to the sides of a triangle.

     We don't plan to do all this. The usual definition was good enough. But note first:
     There is no problem with convergence. The series for sin x and cos x and ex all have

     terms ¨ xn=nS: The factorials make the series converge for all x: The general rule

     for ex times ey can be based on the series. Equation (6) is typical: e is multiplied by

     powers of .x ¡ 1/: Those powers add to ex¡1: So the series proves that ex D eex¡1:

     That is just one example of the multiplication .ex/.ey/ D exCy:

      x2  y2                  x2                                                  y2

                                                                                      (7)

     Term by term, multiplication gives the series for exCy : Term by term, differentiating

     the series for ex gives ex: Term by term, the derivative of sin x is cos x:

           We don't need the famous limit .sin x/=x 1, by which geometry gave us the

           derivative. The identities of trigonometry become identities of infinite series. We
                                                                                 ¡  1         ¤  ¤  ¤
           could  even     define     as  the  first  positive  x  at  which  x     6  x3  C           equals  zero.  But  it  is

           certainly not obvious that this sine series returns to zero--much less that the point of

           return is near 3:14:

             The function that will be defined by infinite series is ei . This is the exponential

           of the imaginary number i (a multiple of i D ¡1). The result ei is a complex

           number, and our goal is to identify it. (We will be confirming Section 9.4.) The

           technique is to treat i like all other numbers, real or complex, and simply put it into

           the series:

           DEFINITION ei is the sum of 1 C .i / C 1 .i /2 C 1 .i /3 C ¤ ¤ ¤ : (9)
                                                                          2S           3S
           Now use i 2 D ¡1: The even powers are i 4 D C1, i 6 D ¡1, i 8 D C1; : : :: We are
           just multiplying ¡1 by ¡1 to get 1: The odd powers are i 3 D ¡i , i 5 D Ci; : : ::
           Therefore ei splits into a real part (with no i 's) and an imaginary part (multiplying

           i ):

           You recognize those series. They are cos  and sin : Therefore:

                           Euler's formula is ei D cos  C i sin : Note that e2i D 1.

           The real part is x D cos  and the imaginary part is y D sin : Those coordinates

           pick out the point ei in the "complex plane." Its distance from the origin .0; 0/ is

           r D 1, because .cos  /2 C .sin  /2 D 1: Its angle is  , as shown in Figure 10.5. The
           number ¡1 is ei ; at the distance r D 1 and the angle : It is on the real axis to
                                      ei                              D2         D  1
           the   left  of  zero.  If      is   multiplied  by      r      or  r     2  or  any      r  0, the result is a

           complex number at a distance r from the origin:

           Complex numbers: rei D r.cos  C i sin  / D r cos  C i r sin  D x C iy:

Fig. 10.5

           With ei , a negative number has a logarithm. The logarithm of ¡1 is imaginary
           (it is i , since ei D ¡1). A negative number also has fractional powers. The fourth
           root of ¡1 is .¡1/1=4 D ei=4: More important for calculus: The derivative of x5=4
           is 54 x1=4. That sounds old and familiar, but at x D ¡1 it was never allowed.

             Complex numbers tie up the loose ends left by the limitations of real num-
           bers.

             The formula ei D cos  C i sin  has been called "one of the greatest mysteries of
           undergraduate mathematics." Writers have used desperate methods to avoid infinite
           series. That proof in (10) may be the clearest (I remember sending it to a prisoner
           studying calculus) but here is a way to start from d=dx.eix/ D i eix:

             A different proof of Euler's formula Any complex number is eix D r.cos  C
           i sin  / for some r and : Take the x derivative of both sides, and substitute for i eix:

             .cos  C i sin  /dr=dx C r.¡ sin  C i cos  /d=dx D i r.cos  C i sin  /:

           Comparing the real parts and also the imaginary parts, we need dr=dx D 0 and
           d=dx D 1: The starting values r D 1 and  D 0 are known from ei0 D 1: There-

           fore r is always 1 and  is x: Substituting into the first sentence of the proof, we
           have Euler's formula ei D 1.cos  C i sin  /:

           10.5 Power Series

     This section studies the properties of a power series. When the basepoint is zero, the
     powers are xn. The series is  anxn. When the basepoint is x D a, the powers are

     .x ¡ a/n. We want to know when and where (and how quickly) the series converges

     to the underlying function. For ex and cos x and sin x there is convergence for all

     x--but that is certainly not true for 1=.1 ¡ x/. The convergence is best when the

     function is smooth.

       First I emphasize that power series are not the only series. For many applications
     they are not the best choice. An alternative is a sum of sines, f .x/ D  bn sin nx.
     That is a "Fourier sine series", which treats all x's equally instead of picking on a

     basepoint. A Fourier series allows jumps and corners in the graph--it takes the rough

     with the smooth. By contrast a power series is terrific near its basepoint, and gets
     worse as you move away. The Taylor coefficients an are totally determined at the
     basepoint--where all derivatives are computed. Remember the rule for Taylor series:

     an D .nth derivative at the basepoint/=nS D f .n/.a/=nS                     (1)

     A remarkable fact is the convergence in a symmetric interval around x D a.

     10M A power series  anxn either converges for all x, or it converges only at
     the basepoint x D 0, or else it has a radius of convergence r:

              anxn converges absolutely if x r and diverges if x r:

     The series  xn=nS converges for all x (the sum is ex). The series  nSxn converges
     for no x (except x D 0). The geometric series  xn converges absolutely for x
     1 and diverges for x 1. Its radius of convergence is r D 1. Note that its sum

     1=.1 ¡ x/ is perfectly good for x 1--the function is all right but the series has

     given up. If something goes wrong at the distance r, a power series can't get past that
     point.

      When the basepoint is x D a, the interval of convergence shifts over to x ¡ a r:
     The series converges for x between a ¡ r and a C r (symmetric around a). We cannot
     say in advance whether the endpoints a ¨ r give divergence or convergence (absolute

     or conditional). Inside the interval, an easy comparison test will now prove conver-
     gence.

     PROOF OF 10M Suppose  anX n converges at a particular point X . The proof will
     show that  anxn converges when x is less than the number X . Thus convergence
     at X gives convergence at all closer points x (I mean closer to the basepoint 0). Proof:
     Since  anX n converges, its terms approach zero. Eventually anX n 1 and then

                                 anxn D anX n x=X n x=X n:

     Our series  anxn is absolutely convergent by comparison with the geometric series
     for x=X , which converges since x=X 1.

     EXAMPLE 1 The series  nxn=4n has radius of convergence r D 4.

     The ratio test and root test are best for power series. The ratios between terms
     approach x=4 (and so does the nth root of nxn=4n):

     .n C 1/xnC1  nxn x n C 1  x
           4n D 4 n approaches L D 4 :

The ratio test gives convergence if L 1, which means x 4.

EXAMPLE 2 The sine series x ¡ x C 3 x5 ¡ ¤ ¤ ¤ has r D                                     (it converges every-

                                           3S 5S
where).

The ratio of xnC2=.n C 2/S to xn=nS is x2=.n C 2/.n C 1/. This approaches L D 0.

EXAMPLE 3 The series .x ¡ 5/n=n2 has radius r D 1 around its basepoint a D

5.

The ratios between terms approach L D x ¡ 5. (The fractions n2=.n C 1/2 go toward
1.) There is absolute convergence if x ¡ 5 1. This is the interval 4 x 6, sym-

metric around the basepoint. This series happens to converge at the endpoints 4 and 6,
because of the factor 1=n2. That factor decides the delicate question--convergence at

the endpoints--but all powers of n give the same interval of convergence 4 x 6.

   CONVERGENCE TO THE FUNCTION: REMAINDER TERM AND RADIUS r

Remember that a Taylor series starts with a function f .x/. The derivatives at the
basepoint produce the series. Suppose the series converges: Does it converge to the

function ? This is a question about the remainder Rn.x/ D f .x/ ¡ sn.x/, which
is the difference between f and the partial sum sn D a0 C ¤ ¤ ¤ C an.x ¡ a/n. The

remainder Rn is the error if we stop the series, ending with the nth derivative term

an.x ¡ a/n.

10N Suppose f has an .n C 1/st derivative from the basepoint a out to x. Then
for some point c in between (position not known) the remainder at x equals

           Rn.x/ D f .x/ ¡ sn.x/ D f .nC1/.c/.x ¡ a/nC1=.n C 1/S                                         (2)

The error in stopping at the nth derivative is controlled by the .n C 1/st derivative.

You will guess, correctly, that the unknown point c comes from the Mean Value
Theorem. For n D 1 the proof is at the end of Section 3.8. That was the error e.x/ in
linear approximation:

           R1   .x  /  D  f  .x  /  ¡  f  .a/  ¡  f  ½  .a/.x    ¡   a/    D  1  f  ¾  .c  /.x  ¡  a/2:
                                                                              2

For every n, the proof compares Rn with .x ¡ a/nC1. Their .n C 1/st derivatives

are f .nC1/ and .n C 1/S The generalized Mean Value Theorem says that the ratio of

Rn to .x ¡ a/nC1 equals the ratio of those derivatives, at the right point c. That is

equation (2). The details can stay in Section 3.8 and Problem 23, because the main

point is what we want. The error is exactly like the next term anC1.x ¡ a/nC1,

except that the .n C 1/st derivative is at c instead of the basepoint a.

EXAMPLE 4 When f is ex, the .n C 1/st derivative is ex. Therefore the error is

                    Rn D ex ¡ 1 C x C  ¤ ¤ ¤C x D e n c : (3)  xnC1
                                                                 nS              .n C 1/S

At  x  D1  and  n D 2,    the    error    is   e  ¡  .  1  C  1  C   1  /  :218. The right side is ec =6.
The unknown point is c D ln.:218 ¤ 6/ D :27. Thus c lies between the basepoint a D 02
460                                       10 Infinite Series

     and the error point x D 1, as required. The series converges to the function, because
     Rn 0.

       In practice, n is the number of derivatives to be calculated. We may aim for an

     error Rn below 10¡6. Unfortunately, the high derivative in formula .2/ is awkward

     to estimate (except for ex). And high derivatives in formula .1/ are difficult to
     compute. Most real calculations use only a few terms of a Taylor series. For more
     accuracy we move the basepoint closer, or switch to another series.

       There is a direct connection between the function and the convergence radius r. A

     hint came for f .x/ D 1=.1 ¡ x/. The function blows up at x D 1--which also ends

     the convergence interval for the series. Another hint comes for f D 1=x, if we expand
     around x D a D 1:

                 1x D 1 1 ¡ .1 ¡ x/ D 1 C .1 ¡ x/ C .1 ¡ x/2C ¤ ¤ ¤ : (4)
     This geometric series converges for 1 ¡ x 1. Convergence stops at the end

     point x D 0--exactly where 1=x blows up. The failure of the function stops the
     convergence of the series. But note that 1=.1 C x2/, which never seems to fail, also
     has convergence radius r D 1:

           1=.1 C x2/ D 1 ¡ x2 C x4 ¡ x6 C ¤ ¤ ¤ converges only for x 1:

     When you see the reason, you will know why r is a "radius." There is a circle, and
     the function fails at the edge of the circle. The circle contains complex numbers as

     well as real numbers. The imaginary points i and ¡i are at the edge of the circle. The

     function fails at those points because 1=.1 C i 2/ D .
       Complex numbers are pulling the strings, out of sight. The circle of convergence

     reaches out to the nearest "singularity" of f .x/, real or imaginary or complex. For

     1=.1 C x2/, the singularities at i and ¡i make r D 1. If we expand around a D 3,
     the distance to i and ¡i is r D 10. If we change to ln .1 C x/, which blows up at
     x D ¡1, the radius of convergence of x ¡ 12 x2 C 13 x3 ¡ ¤ ¤ ¤ is r D 1.

          Fig. 10.6 Convergence radius r is distance from basepoint a to nearest singularity.

                                     THE BINOMIAL SERIES

     We close this chapter with one more series. It is the Taylor series for .1 C x/p, around
                                                             1
     the  basepoint  x  D  0.  A  typical  power  is  p   D  2  ,  where  we          want  the  terms  in

                                  1  C     x  D  1  C  1  x  C  a2  x  2  C  ¤  ¤  ¤  :

The  slow  way  is  to  square  both  sides,  which  gives   1  C  x  C  .2a2  C  1  /x2  on  the  right.

Since  1Cx  is  on  the  left,  a2  D     8  is  needed  to  remove   the      term.    Eventually  a3

can be found. The fast way is to match the derivatives of f D .1 C x/1=2:

f ½ D 12 .1 C x/¡1=2 f ¾ D 21  ¡ 21 .1 C x/¡3=2 f ¿ D 21  ¡ 21  ¡ 23 .1 C x/¡5=2:

At x D 0 those derivatives are 12 ; ¡ 14 ; 83 . Dividing by 1S; 2S; 3S gives

These are the binomial coefficients when the power is p D 21 .
  Notice the difference from the binomials in Chapter 2. For those, the power p was

a positive integer. The series .1 C x/2 D 1 C 2x C x2 stopped at x2. The coefficients
for p D 2 were 1; 2; 1; 0; 0; 0; : : :: For fractional p or negative p those later coeffi-
cients are not zero, and we find them from the derivatives of .1 C x/p:

For p D n that last binomial coefficient is nS=nS D 1. It gives the final xn at the end
of .1 C x/n. For other values of p, the binomial series never stops. It converges for

x 1:

 .1 C x/p D 1 C px C p.p ¡ 1/x2 C ¤ ¤ ¤ D X p.p ¡ 1/ ¤ ¤ ¤.p ¡ n C 1/xn: (6)

When p D 1; 2; 3; : : : the binomial coefficient pS=nS.n ¡ p/S counts the number

of ways to select a group of n friends out of a group of p friends. If you have 20
friends, you can choose 2 of them in .20/.19/=2 D 190 ways.

  Suppose p is not a positive integer. What goes wrong with .1 C x/p, to stop the

convergence at x D 1 ? The failure is at x D ¡1. If p is negative, .1 C x/p blow

up. If p is positive, as in 1 C x, the higher derivatives blow up. Only for a positive
integer p D n does the convergence radius move out to r D . In that case the series
for .1 C x/n stops at xn, and f never fails.

  A power series is a function in a new form. It is not a simple form, but sometimes
it is the only form. To compute f we have to sum the series. To square f we have to
multiply series. But the operations of calculus--derivative and integral--are easier.
That explains why power series help to solve differential equations, which are a rich
source of new functions. (Numerically the series are not always so good.) I should
have said that the derivative and integral are easy for each separate term anxn--and
fortunately the convergence radius of the whole series is not changed.

If f .x/ D  anxn has convergence radius r, so do its derivative and its integral:

df =dx D  nanxn¡1 and f .x/dx D  anxnC1=.n C 1/ also converge for x r.

EXAMPLE 5 The series for 1=.1 ¡ x/ and its derivative 1=.1 ¡ x/2 and its integral
¡ ln.1 ¡ x/ all have r D 1 (because they all have trouble at x D 1). The series are

 xn and  nxn¡1 and  xnC1=.n C 1/.

                     CHAPTER 11

     Vectors and Matrices

464  This chapter opens up a new part of calculus. It is multidimensional calculus,
     because the subject moves into more dimensions. In the first ten chapters, all
     functions depended on time t or position x--but not both. We had f .t / or y.x/. The
     graphs were curves in a plane. There was one independent variable (x or t )
     and one dependent variable (y or f ). Now we meet functions f .x; t / that depend
     on both x and t . Their graphs are surfaces instead of curves. This brings us to the
     calculus of several variables.

       Start with the surface that represents the function f .x; t / or f .x; y/ or f .x; y; t /.
     I emphasize functions, because that is what calculus is about.

     EXAMPLE 7 f .x; t / D cos.x ¡ t / is a traveling wave (cosine curve in motion).

     At t D 0 the curve is f D cos x. At a later time, the curve moves to the right
     (Figure 11.1). At each t we get a cross-section of the whole x-t surface. For a wave
     traveling along a string, the height depends on position as well as time.

       A similar function gives a wave going around a stadium. Each person stands up and
     sits down. Somehow the wave travels.

     EXAMPLE 8 f .x; y/ D 3x C y C 1 is a sloping roof (fixed in time).

     The surface is two-dimensional--you can walk around on it. It is flat because

     3x C y C 1 is a linear function. In the y direction the surface goes up at 45¥. If y

     increases by 1, so does f . That slope is 1. In the x direction the roof is steeper
     (slope 3). There is a direction in between where the roof is steepest (slope 10).

     EXAMPLE 9 f .x; y; t / D cos.x ¡ y ¡ t / is an ocean surface with traveling waves.

     This surface moves. At each time t we have a new x-y surface. There are three
     variables, x and y for position and t for time. I can't draw the function, it needs
     four dimensions! The base coordinates are x; y; t and the height is f . The alternative
     is a movie that shows the x-y surface changing with t .

      At time t D 0 the ocean surface is given by cos.x ¡ y/. The waves are in straight
     lines. The line x ¡ y D 0 follows a crest because cos 0 D 1. The top of the next wave
     is on the parallel line x ¡ y D 2, because cos 2 D 1. Figure 11.1 shows the ocean

     surface at a fixed time.

 The line x ¡ y D t gives the crest at time t . The water goes up and down (like

people in a stadium). The wave goes to shore; but the water stays in the ocean.

              bands seem to go from top to bottom as you turn.

  Of course multidimensional calculus is not only for waves. In business, demand is
a function of price and date. In engineering, the velocity and temperature depend on
position x and time t . Biology deals with many variables at once (and statistics is
always looking for linear relations like z D x C 2y). A serious job lies ahead, to carry
derivatives and integrals into more dimensions.

     up by y. Starting from the origin we reach the point with coordinates .x; y/. I want
     to describe this movement by a vector--the straight line that starts at .0; 0/ and
     ends at .x; y/. This vector v has a direction, which goes from .0; 0/ to .x; y/ and
     not the other way.

       In a picture, the vector is shown by an arrow. In algebra, v is given by its two
     components. For a column vector, write x above y:

         "#
         x
     vD      (x and y are the components of v):                                        (1)
         y

     Note that v is printed in boldface; its components x and y are in lightface. The

     vector ¡v in the opposite direction changes signs. Adding v to ¡v gives the zero

     vector (different from the zero number and also in boldface):

     " ¡v D ¡x # " and v ¡ v D x ¡ x # " D 0# D 0: (2)
     ¡y                y¡y 0

     Notice how vector addition or subtraction is done separately on the x's and y's:

             "3# "¡1# "2#
            vCwD C     D:                                                              (3)
             1      2  3

           Fig. 11.3 Parallelogram for v C w, stretching for 2v, signs reversed for ¡v.

     The vector v has components v1 D 3 and v2 D 1. (I write v1 for the first compo-
     nent and v2 for the second component. I also write x and y, which is fine for two

     components.) The vector w has w1 D ¡1 and w2 D 2. To add the vectors, add the

     components. To draw this addition, place the start of w at the end of v. Fig-
     ure 11.3 shows how w starts where v ends.

                                   VECTORS WITHOUT COORDINATES

     In that head-to-tail addition of v C w, we did something new. The vector w was
     moved away from the origin. Its length and direction were not changed! The new
     arrow is parallel to the old arrow--only the starting point is different. The vector
     is the same as before.

        A vector can be defined without an origin and without x and y axes. The purpose
     of axes is to give the components--the separate distances x and y. Those numbers

      Another way to indicate a vector is v . You will recognize vectors without needing arrows.
                            11.1 Vectors and Dot Products                                   467

are necessary for calculations. But x and y coordinates are not necessary for head-to-
tail addition v C w, or for stretching to 2v, or for linear combinations 2v C 3w. Some
applications depend on coordinates, others don't.

  Generally speaking, physics works without axes--it is "coordinate-free." A veloc-
ity has direction and magnitude, but it is not tied to a point. A force also has direction
and magnitude, but it can act anywhere--not only at the origin. In contrast, a vec-
tor that gives the prices of five stocks is not floating in space. Each component has
a meaning--there are five axes, and we know when prices are zero. After examples
from geometry and physics (no axes), we return to vectors with coordinates.

EXAMPLE 1 (Geometry) Take any four-sided figure in space. Connect the mid-
points
of the four straight sides. Remarkable fact: Those four midpoints lie in the same
plane. More than that, they form a parallelogram.

  Frankly, this is amazing. Figure 11.4a cannot do justice to the problem, because it
is printed on a flat page. Imagine the vectors A and D coming upward. B and C go
down at different angles. Notice how easily we indicate the four sides as vectors, not
caring about axes or origin.

  I will prove that V D W. That shows that the midpoints form a parallelogram.
  What is V ? It starts halfway along A and ends halfway along B. The small triangle
at the bottom shows V D 12 A C 12 B. This is vector addition--the tail of 21 B is at the
head of 12 A. Together they equal the shortcut V. For the same reason W D 12 C C 12 D.
The heart of the proof is to see these relationships.
  One step is left. Why is 12 A C 12 B equal to 12 C C 12 D ? In other words, why is
A C B equal to C C D ? (I multiplied by 2.) When the right question is asked, the
answer jumps out. A head-to-tail addition A C B brings us to the point R. Also C C D
brings us to R. The proof comes down to one line:

        A C B D PR D C C D: Then V D 12 A C 21 B equals W D 12 C C 12 D:

     Fig. 11.4 Four midpoints form a parallelogram .V D W/. Three medians meet at P .

EXAMPLE 2 (Also geometry) In any triangle, draw lines from the corners to the
midpoints of the opposite sides. To prove by vectors: Those three lines meet at a
point. Problem 38 finds the meeting point in Figure 11.4c. Problem 37 says that the
three vectors add to zero.

     EXAMPLE 3 (Medicine) An electrocardiogram shows the sum of many small
     vectors, the voltages in the wall of the heart. What happens to this sum--the heart
     vector V--in two cases that a cardiologist is watching for ?

               Case 1. Part of the heart is dead (infarction).
               Case 2. Part of the heart is abnormally thick (hypertrophy).

     A heart attack kills part of the muscle. A defective valve, or hypertension, overworks
     it. In case 1 the cells die from the cutoff of blood (loss of oxygen). In case 2 the
     heart wall can triple in size, from excess pressure. The causes can be chemical or
     mechanical. The effect we see is electrical.

       The machine is adding small vectors and "projecting" them in twelve direc-
     tions.
     The leads on the arms, left leg, and chest give twelve directions in the body. Each
     graph shows the component of V in one of those directions. Three of the projections--
     two in the vertical plane, plus lead 2 for front-back--produce the "mean QRS vector"
     in Figure 11.5. That is the sum V when the ventricles start to contract. The left
     ventricle is larger, so the heart vector normally points down and to the left.

     Fig. 11.5 V is a sum of small voltage vectors, at the moment of depolarization.

                    Fig. 11.6 Changes in V show dead muscle and overworked muscle.

       We come soon to projections, but here the question is about V itself. How does
     the ECG identify the problem ?
                            11.1 Vectors and Dot Products                                 469

        Case 1W Heart attack The dead cells make no contribution to the
        electrical potential. Some small vectors are missing. Therefore the
        sum V turns away from the infarcted part.
        Case 2W Hypertrophy The overwork increases the contribution to
        the potential. Some vectors are larger than normal. Therefore V
        turns toward the thickened part.

When V points in an abnormal direction, the ECG graphs locate the problem. The
P; Q; R; S; T waves on separate graphs can all indicate hypertrophy, in different
regions of the heart. Infarctions generally occur in the left ventricle, which needs the
greatest blood supply. When the supply of oxygen is cut back, that ventricle feels it
first. The result can be a heart attack (D myocardial infarction D coronary occlusion).
Section 11.2 shows how the projections on the ECG point to the location.

  First come the basic facts about vectors--components, lengths, and dot products.

                           COORDINATE VECTORS AND LENGTH

To compute with vectors we need axes and coordinates. The picture of the heart is
"coordinate-free," but calculations require numbers. A vector is known by its com-
ponents. The unit vectors along the axes are i and j in the plane and i; j; k in
space:

"# "#                              213 203 203
    1               0
in 2DW i D ; j D           in 3DW  i D 46057 ; j D 46157 ; k D 46157 :
    0               1
                                   0  0                0

Notice how easily we moved into three dimensions! The only change is that vectors
have three components. The combinations of i and j (or i, j, k) produce all vectors v
in the plane (and all vectors V in space):

                   "#                            2 13
                     3
                           V D i C 2j ¡ 2k D 46 257 :
    v D 3i C j D                          ¡2
                     1

Those vectors are also written v D .3; 1/ and V D .1; 2; ¡2/. The components of

the vector are also the coordinates of a point. (The vector goes from the origin to the

point.) This relation between point and vector is so close that we allow them the same
notation: P D .x; y; z/ and v D .x; y; z/ D xi C yj C zk.

  The sum v C V is totally meaningless. Those vectors live in different dimensions.

  From the components we find the length. The length of .3; 1/ is 32 C 12 D 10.
This comes directly from a right triangle. In three dimensions, V has a third
component to be squared and added. The length of V D .x; y; z/ is V D x2 C y2 C z2.

  Vertical bars indicate length, which takes the place of absolute value. The length
of v D 3i C j is the distance from the point .0; 0/ to the point .3; 1/:

vD     v2   C  v2   D  10  V D 12 C 22 C .¡2/2 D 3:

         1       2

A unit vector is a vector of length one. Dividing v and V by their lengths produces
unit vectors in the same directions:

     11A Each nonzero vector has a positive length v . The direction of v is given by
     a unit vector u D v= v . The length times direction equals v.

     A unit vector in the plane is determined by its angle  with the x axis:

     Then cos2 C cos2 C cos2 D 1. We are doing algebra with numbers while we are
     doing geometry with vectors. It was the great contribution of Descartes to see how to
     study algebra and geometry at the same time.

                                THE DOT PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS

     There are two basic operations on vectors. First, vectors are added .v C w/. Second,

     a vector is multiplied by a scalar .7v or ¡2w/. That leaves a natural question--how

     do you multiply two vectors ? The main part of the answer is--you don't. But there is
     an extremely important operation that begins with two vectors and produces a

     number. It is usually indicated by a dot between the vectors, as in v ¤ w, so it is

     called the dot product.

     DEFINITION 1 The dot product multiplies the lengths v times w times a

     cosine:  v ¤ w D v w cos ;  D angle between v and w:

              "#                 "#
              3                  2
     EXAMPLE      has length 3;      has length  8, the angle is 45¥:
              0                  2

     The dot product is v w cos  D .3/. 8/.1= 2/, which simplifies to 6: The square

     roots in the lengths are "canceled" by square roots in the cosine. For computing v ¤ w,

     a second and much simpler way involves no square roots in the first place.

DEFINITION 2 The dot product v ¤ w multiplies component by component and

adds:

            v ¤ w D v1w1 C v2w2                  " #" #

                                                  3 ¤ 2 D .3/.2/ C .0/.2/ D 6:

                                                   02

The first form v w cos  is coordinate-free. The second form v1w1 C v2w2
computes with coordinates. Remark 4 explains why these two forms are equal.

11B The dot product or scalar product or inner product of three-dimensional

vectors is           V ¤ W D V W cos  D V1W1 C V2W2 C V3W3:

                                                                                                            (4)

If the vectors are perpendicular then  D 90¥ and cos  D 0 and V ¤ W D 0.

213 243                                                         2 23 2¡13
                                                                46 2 57 ¤ 46 2 57 D 0 (perpendicular):
46 2 57 ¤ 46 5 57 D 32 (not perpendicular)
                                                                 ¡1 2
  36

These dot products 32 and 0 equal V W cos  . In the second one, cos  must be

zero. The angle is =2 or ¡=2--in either case a right angle. Fortunately the cosine
is the same for  and ¡ , so we need not decide the sign of  .

Remark 1 When V D W the angle is zero but not the cosine! In this case cos  D 1

and V ¤ V D V 2. The dot product of V with itself is the length squared:

            V  ¤  V  D  .V1  ;  V2  ;  V3  /  ¤  .V1  ;  V2  ;  V3  /  D  V  2  C  V  2  C  V  2  D  V  2:  (5)
                                                                             1        2        3

Remark 2 The dot product of i D .1; 0; 0/ with j D .0; 1; 0/ is i ¤ j D 0. The
axes are perpendicular. Similarly i ¤ k D 0 and j ¤ k D 0. Those are unit vectors:
i¤i D j¤j D k¤k D 1.

Remark 3 The dot product has three properties that keep the algebra simple:

1. V ¤W D W ¤V 2. .cV/ ¤W D c.V ¤W/ 3. .U C V/ ¤W D U ¤W C V ¤W

When V is doubled .c D 2/ the dot product is doubled. When V is split into i; j; k
components, the dot product splits in three pieces. The same applies to W, since

V ¤ W D W ¤ V. The nine dot products of i; j; k are zeros and ones, and a giant splitting
of both V and W gives back the correct V ¤ W:

     Remark 4 The two forms of the dot product are equal. This comes from com-

     puting V ¡ W 2 by coordinates and also by the "law of cosines":
         with coordinates W V ¡ W 2 D .V1 ¡ W1/2 C .V2 ¡ W2/2 C .V3 ¡ W3/2

     Compare   those  two   lines.  Line  1   contains    V  2   and  V  2  and  V  2.  Their  sum  matches
                                                             1           2
                                                    2         2                     3
        2                               W  2  C  W  2  C  W   3             W 2. Therefore the terms
     V     in  the  cosine  law.  Also     1                     matches
     containing ¡2 are the same (you can mentally cancel the ¡2). The definitions agree:

           ¡2.V1W1 C V2W2 C V3W3/ equals ¡ 2 V W cos  equals ¡ 2V ¤ W:

     The cosine law is coordinate-free. It applies to all triangles (even in n dimensions).

     Its vector form in Figure 11.8 is V ¡ W 2 D V 2 ¡ 2V ¤W C W 2. This application
     to V ¤ W is its brief moment of glory.

     Remark 6 The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality V ¤W                                    V W comes from

      cos  1.

     The left side is V W cos  . It never exceeds the right side V W . This is a key
     inequality in mathematics, from which so many others follow:

                       11.2 Planes and Projections

     The most important "curves" are straight lines. The most important functions are
     linear. Those sentences take us back to the beginning of the book--the graph of
     mx C b is a line. The goal now is to move into three dimensions, where graphs
     are surfaces. Eventually the surfaces will be curved. But calculus starts with the flat
     surfaces that correspond to straight lines:

         What are the most important surfaces ? Planes.
         What are the most important functions ? Still linear.

     The geometrical idea of a plane is turned into algebra, by finding the equation of a
     plane. Not just a general formula, but the particular equation of a particular plane.

       A line is determined by one point .x0; y0/ and the slope m. The point-slope

     equation is y ¡ y0 D m.x ¡ x0/. That is a linear equation, it is satisfied when y D y0

     and x D x0, and dy=dx is m. For a plane, we start again with a particular point--
     which is now .x0; y0; z0/. But the slope of a plane is not so simple. Many planes

     climb at a 45¥ angle--with "slope 1"--and more information is needed.

       The direction of a plane is described by a vector N. The vector is not in the plane,
     but perpendicular to the plane. In the plane, there are many directions. Perpendicular
     to the plane, there is only one direction. A vector in that perpendicular direction is
     a normal vector.

       The normal vector N can point "up" or "down". The length of N is not crucial (we
     often make it a unit vector and call it n). Knowing N and the point P0 D .x0; y0; z0/,
     we know the plane (Figure 11.9). For its equation we switch to algebra and use the
     dot product--which is the key to perpendicularity.

       N is described by its components .a; b; c/. In other words N is ai C bj C ck. This
     vector is perpendicular to every direction in the plane. A typical direction goes
     from

     Fig. 11.9 The normal vector to a plane. Parallel planes have the same N.

     P0 to another point P D .x; y; z/ in the plane. The vector from P0 to P has

     components .x ¡ x0; y ¡ y0; z ¡ z0/: This vector lies in the plane, so its dot product

     with N is zero:

     11C The plane through P0 perpendicular to N D .a; b; c/ has the equation

     .a; b; c/ ¤ .x ¡ x0; y ¡ y0; z ¡ z0/ D 0 or
     a.x ¡ x0/ C b.y ¡ y0/ C c.z ¡ z0/ D 0:
                                                                               (1)

EXAMPLE 1 The plane through P0 D .1; 2; 3/ perpendicular to N D .1; 1; 1/ has

the equation .x ¡ 1/ C .y ¡ 2/ C .z ¡ 3/ D 0. That can be rewritten as x C y C z D

6.

  Notice three things. First, P0 lies on the plane because 1 C 2 C 3 D 6. Second,
N D .1; 1; 1/ can be recognized from the x; y; z coefficients in x C y C z D 6. Third,

we could change N to .2; 2; 2/ and we could change P0 to .8; 2; ¡4/--because N is
still perpendicular and P0 is still in the plane: 8 C 2 ¡ 4 D 6.

 The new normal vector N D .2; 2; 2/ produces 2.x ¡ 1/ C 2.y ¡ 2/ C 2.z ¡ 3/ D

0. That can be rewritten as 2x C 2y C 2z D 12. Same normal direction, same plane.

 The new point P0 D .8; 2; ¡4/ produces .x ¡ 8/ C .y ¡ 2/ C .z C 4/ D 0. That is

another form of x C y C z D 6. All we require is a perpendicular N and a point P0 in
the plane.

EXAMPLE 2 The plane through .1; 2; 4/ with the same N D .1; 1; 1/ has a differ-

ent equation: .x ¡ 1/ C .y ¡ 2/ C .z ¡ 4/ D 0. This is x C y C z D 7 (instead of 6).

These planes with 7 and 6 are parallel.

 Starting from a.x ¡ x0/ C b.y ¡ y0/ C c.z ¡ z0/ D 0, we often move ax0 C by0 C

cz0 to the right hand side--and call this constant d :

11D With the P0 terms on the right side, the equation of the plane is N ¤ P D d :

ax C by C cz D ax0 C by0 C cz0 D d:  (2)

A different d gives a parallel plane; d D 0 gives a plane through the origin.

EXAMPLE 3 The plane x ¡ y C 3z D 0 goes through the origin .0; 0; 0/. The
normal vector is read directly from the equation: N D .1; ¡1; 3/. The equation is

satisfied by P0 D .1; 1; 0/ and P D .1; 4; 1/. Subtraction gives a vector V D .0; 3; 1/

that is in the plane, and N¤V D 0.

 The parallel planes x ¡ y C 3z D d have the same N but different d 's. These planes

miss the origin because d is not zero .x D 0; y D 0; z D 0 on the left side needs

d D 0 on the right side). Note that 3x ¡ 3y C 9z D ¡15 is parallel to both planes.

N is changed to 3N in Figure 11.9, but its direction is not changed.

EXAMPLE 4 The angle between two planes is the angle between their normal
vectors.

The planes x ¡ y C 3z D 0 and 3y C z D 0 are perpendicular, because .1; ¡1; 3/ ¤
.0; 3; 1/ D 0. The planes z D 0 and y D 0 are also perpendicular, because .0; 0; 1/ ¤

.0; 1; 0/ D 0. (Those are the xy plane and the xz plane.) The planes x C y D 0 and

x C z D 0 make a 60¥ angle, because cos 60¥ D .1; 1; 0/ ¤ .1; 0; 1/= 2 2 D 12 .
 The cosine of the angle between two planes is N1 ¤ N2 = N1 N2 . See Figure 11.10.

                     line. A line in space through P0 and Q.

     Remark 1 We gave the "point-slope" equation of a line (using m), and the "point-
     normal" equation of a plane (using N). What is the normal vector N to a line ?

       The vector V D .1; m/ is parallel to the line y D mx C b. The line goes across by

     1 and up by m. The perpendicular vector is N D .¡m; 1/. The dot product N¤V is
     ¡m C m D 0. Then the point-normal equation matches the point-slope equation:

           ¡m.x ¡ x0/ C 1.y ¡ y0/ D 0 is the same as y ¡ y0 D m.x ¡ x0/: (3)

     Remark 2 What is the point-slope equation for a plane ? The difficulty is that a
     plane has different slopes in the x and y directions. The function f .x; y/ D

     m.x ¡ x0/ C M.y ¡ y0/ has two derivatives m and M .

       This remark has to stop. In Chapter 13; "slopes" become "partial derivatives."

                                                A LINE IN SPACE

     In three dimensions, a line is not as simple as a plane. A line in space needs two
     equations. Each equation gives a plane, and the line is the intersection of two planes.

           The equations x C y C z D 3 and 2x C 3y C z D 6 determine a line:

     Two points on that line are P0 D .1; 1; 1/ and Q D .3; 0; 0/. They satisfy both
     equations so they lie on both planes. Therefore they are on the line of intersection.
     The direction of that line, subtracting coordinates of P0 from Q, is along the vector

     V D 2i¡ j ¡ k.
        The line goes through P0 D .1; 1; 1/ in the direction of V D 2i ¡ j ¡ k:

     Starting from .x0; y0; z0/ D .1; 1; 1/, add on any multiple t V. Then x D 1 C 2t
     and

     y D 1 ¡ t and z D 1 ¡ t . Those are the components of the vector equation

     P D P0 C t V--which produces the line.
       Here is the problem. The line needs two equations--or a vector equation with a pa-

     rameter t . Neither form is as simple as ax C by C cz D d . Some books push ahead
     anyway, to give full details about both forms. After trying this approach, I believe
     that those details should wait. Equations with parameters are the subject of
     Chapter 12; and a line in space is the first example. Vectors and planes give plenty to
     do here--especially when a vector is projected onto another vector or a plane.

                                        PROJECTION OF A VECTOR

     What is the projection of a vector B onto another vector A ? One part of B goes
     along A--that is the projection. The other part of B is perpendicular to A. We now

     compute these two parts, which are P and B ¡ P.
                              11.2 Planes and Projections                                  479

  In geometry, projections involve cos  . In algebra, we use the dot product (which
is closely tied to cos  ). In applications, the vector B might be a velocity V or a force
F:

        An airplane flies northeast, and a 100-mile per hour wind blows due
        east. What is the projection of V D .100; 0/ in the flight direction A ?
        Gravity makes a ball roll down the surface 2x C 2y C z D 0. What are

     the projections of F D .0; 0; ¡mg/ in the plane and perpendicular to

        the plane ?

The component of V along A is the push from the wind (tail wind). The other
component of V pushes sideways (crosswind). Similarly the force parallel to the
surface makes the ball move. Adding the two components brings back V or F.

Fig. 11.11 Projections along A of wind velocity V and force F and vector B.

  We now compute the projection of B onto A. Call this projection P. Since its
direction is known--P is along A--we can describe P in two ways:

       1) Give the length of P along A
       2) Give the vector P as a multiple of A.

Figure 11.11b shows the projection P and its length. The hypotenuse is B . The

length is P D B cos . The perpendicular component B ¡ P has length B sin .

The cosine is positive for angles less than 90¥: The cosine (and P!) are zero when
A and B are perpendicular. B cos is negative for angles greater than 90¥; and the
projection points along - A (the length is B cos  ). Unless the angle is 0¥ or 30¥
or 45¥ or 60¥ or 90¥; we don't want to compute cosines--and we don't have to. The

dot product does it automatically:

   A B cos  D A ¤ B so the length of P along A is B cos  D A ¤ B: (4)

                                                                                    A

Notice that the length of A cancels out at the end of (4). If A is doubled, P is

unchanged. But if B is doubled, the projection is doubled.

 What is the vector P ? Its length along A is A ¤ B= A . If A is a unit vector, then
A D 1 and the projection is A ¤ B times A. Generally A is not a unit vector, until we

divide by A . Here is the projection P of B along A:

                                  A¤B A  A¤B
P D (length of P)(unit vector) D        D 2 A:                               (5)

     EXAMPLE 5 For the wind velocity V D .100; 0/ and flying direction A D .1; 1/,
     find P. Here V points east, A points northeast. The projection of V onto A is P:

     EXAMPLE 6 Project F D .0; 0; ¡mg/ onto the plane with normal N D .2; 2; 1/.

     The projection of F along N is not the answer. But compute that first:

               N                                      N

     P is the component of F perpendicular to the plane. It does not move the ball. The

     in-plane component is the difference F ¡ P. Any vector B has two projections, along

     A and perpendicular:

     The projection P D 2 A ¤ B A is perpendicular to the remaining component B ¡ P:

     Question When is P D 0 ? Answer When A and B are perpendicular.

     EXAMPLE 8 Find the nearest point to the origin on the plane x C 2y C 2z D
     5.

     The shortest distance from the origin is along the normal vector N. The vector P
     to the nearest point (Figure 11.12) is t times N, for some unknown number t . We find
     t by requiring P D t N to lie on the plane.

       The plane x C 2y C 2z D 5 has normal vector N D .1; 2; 2/. Therefore P D t N D
     .t; 2t; 2t /. To lie on the plane, this must satisfy x C 2y C 2z D 5:

               t C 2.2t / C 2.2t / D 5 or 9t D 5 or t D 59 :                                        (6)

     Then  PD 59 ND. 59 ; 109 ; 109 /. That  locates  the  nearest  point. The  distance  is  5  N  D 53 .
                                                                                              9

     This example is important enough to memorize, with letters not numbers:

     11E On the plane ax C by C cz D d , the nearest point to .0; 0; 0/ is

                     .da; db; dc/            The distance is              d          :              (7)

     The steps are the same. N has components a; b; c. The nearest point on the plane is
     a multiple .t a; t b; t c/. It lies on the plane if a.t a/ C b.t b/ C c.t c/ D d .

  Thus t D d=.a2 C b2 C c2/. The point .t a; t b; t c/ D t N is in equation (7). The
distance to the plane is t N D d = N .

Fig. 11.12 Vector to the nearest point P is a multiple tN. The distance is in .7/ and .9/:

Question How far is the plane from an arbitrary point Q D .x1; y1; z1/ ?
Answer The vector from Q to P is our multiple t N. In vector form P D Q C t N.

This reaches the plane if P ¤ N D d , and again we find t :

.Q C tN/ ¤N D d yields t D .d ¡ Q ¤N/= N 2:                   (8)

This new term Q ¤ N enters the distance from Q to the plane:

distanceD tN D d ¡ Q ¤ N = N D d ¡ ax1 ¡ by1 ¡ cz1 = a2 C b2 C c2: (9)

When the point is on the plane, that distance is zero--because ax1 C by1 C cz1 D d .

When Q is i C 3j C 2k, the figure shows Q ¤ N D 11 and distance D 2.

                          PROJECTIONS OF THE HEART VECTOR

An electrocardiogram has leads to your right arm-left arm-left leg. You produce
the voltage. The machine amplifies and records the readings. There are also six chest
leads, to add a front-back dimension that is monitored across the heart. We will
concentrate on the big "Einthoven triangle," named after the inventor of the ECG.

  The graphs show voltage variations plotted against time. The first graph plots the
voltage difference between the arms. Lead II connects the left leg to the right arm.
Lead III completes the triangle, which has roughly equal sides (especially if you are

a little lopsided). So the projections are based on 60¥ and 120¥ angles.

  The heart vector V is the sum of many small vectors--all moved to the same
origin. V is the net effect of action potentials from the cells--small dipoles adding

to a single dipole. The pacemaker (S¡A node) starts the impulse. The atria depolar-

ize to give the P wave on the graphs. This is actually a P loop of the heart vector--
the graphs only show its projections. The impulse reaches the AV node, pauses, and
moves quickly through the ventricles. This produces the QRS complex--the large
sharp movement on the graph.
482                                     11 Vectors and Matrices

     Fig. A  The graphs show the component of the moving heart vector along each lead. These
             figures art reproduced with permission from the CIBA Collection of Medical Illustra-
             tions by Frank H. Netter, M.D. Copyright 1978 CIBA-GEIGY, all rights reserved.

       The total QRS interval should not exceed 1=10 second (2 12 spaces on the print-
     out). V points first toward the right shoulder. This direction is opposite to the leads,
     so the tracings go slightly down. That is the Q wave, small and negative. Then the
     heart vector sweeps toward the left leg. In positions 3 and 4, its projection on lead I
     (between the arms) is strongly positive. The R wave is this first upward deflection in
     each lead. Closing the loop, the S wave is negative (best seen in leads I and aVR).

     Question 1 How many graphs from the arms and leg are really independent ?

     Answer Only two! In a plane, the heart vector V has two components. If we know
     two projections, we can compute the others. (The ECG does that for us.) Different

     vectors show better in different projections. A mathematician would use 90¥ angles,

     with an electrode at your throat.

     Question 2 How are the voltages related ? What is the aVR lead ?

     Answer Project the heart vector V onto the sides of the triangle:

             The lead vectors have LI ¡ LII C LIII D 0-- they form a triangle.
             The projections have VI ¡ VII C VIII D V ¤ LI ¡ V ¤ LII C V ¤ LIII D 0.

     The  a  VR  lead  is  ¡  1  LI  ¡  1  LII.  It  is  pure  algebra  (no  wire).  By  vector  addition  it  points
                              2         2

     toward the electrode on the right arm. Its length is 3 if the other lengths are 2:

     Including aVL and aVF to the left arm and foot, there are six leads intersecting at

     equal angles. Visualize them going out from a single point (the origin in the chest).

     Question 3 If the heart vector is V D 2i ¡ j, what voltage differences are recorded ?

     Answer The leads around the triangle have length 2: The machine projects V:

           Lead I is the horizontal vector 2i. So V ¤ LI D 4.
           Lead II is the ¡60¥ vector i ¡ 3j. So V ¤ LII D 2 C 3.
           Lead III is the ¡120¥ vector ¡i ¡ 3j. So V ¤ LIII D ¡2 C 3.

     The first and third add to the second. The largest R waves are in leads I and II. In
     aVR the projection of V will be negative (Problem 46), and will be labeled an S
     wave.

     Question 4 What about the potential (not just its differences). Is it zero at the
     center ?
                        11.2 Planes and Projections                                          483

     Fig. B Heart vector goes around the QRS loop. Projections are spikes on the ECG.

Answer It is zero if we say so. The potential contains an arbitrary constant C . (It
is like an indefinite integral. Its differences are like definite integrals.) Cardiologists
define a "central terminal" where the potential is zero.

  The average of V over a loop is the mean heart vector H. This average requires
 Vdt , by Chapter 5: With no time to integrate, the doctor looks for a lead where the
area under the QRS complex is zero. Then the direction of H (the axis) is perpendic-
ular to that lead. There is so much to say about calculus in medicine.

     11.3 Cross Products and Determinants

     After saying that vectors are not multiplied, we offered the dot product. Now we

     contradict ourselves further, by defining the cross product. Where A ¤ B was a number,
     the cross product A ¢ B is a vector. It has length and direction:

          The length is A B sin  : The direction is perpendicular to A and B:

     The cross product (also called vector product) is defined in three dimensions only.

     A and B lie on a plane through the origin. A ¢ B is along the normal vector N,

     perpendicular to that plane. We still have to say whether it points "up" or "down"
     along N:

      The length of A ¢ B depends on sin  , where A ¤ B involved cos : The dot product

     rewards vectors for being parallel .cos 0 D 1/: The cross product is largest when A is
     perpendicular to B .sin =2 D 1/: At every angle

     That will be a bridge from geometry to algebra. This section goes from definition

     to formula to volume to determinant. Equations (6) and (14) are the key formulas

         ¢ B:

     for A

      Notice that A ¢ A D 0: (This is the zero vector, not the zero number.) When B is
     parallel to A, the angle is zero and the sine is zero. Parallel vectors have A ¢ B D 0:
     Perpendicular vectors have sin  D 1 and A ¢ B D A B D area of rectangle with

     sides A and B:

      Here are four examples that lead to the cross product A ¢ B:

     EXAMPLE 1 (From geometry) Find the area of a parallelogram and a triangle.

     Vectors A and B, going out from the origin, form two sides of a triangle. They produce
     the parallelogram in Figure 11.13, which is twice as large as the triangle.

       The area of a parallelogram is base times height (perpendicular height not sloping
     height). The base is A : The height is B sin  : We take absolute values because
     height and area are not negative. Then the area is the length of the cross product:

     area of parallelogram D A B sin  D A ¢ B :                                  (2)

     Fig. 11.13 Area A ¢ B and moment R ¢ F : Cross products are perpendicular to the page.

     EXAMPLE 2 (From physics) The torque vector T D R ¢ F produces rotation.

     The force F acts at the point .x; y; z/: When F is parallel to the position vector
     R D xi C yj C zk, the force pushes outward (no turning). When F is perpendicu-
     lar to R, the force creates rotation. For in-between angles there is an outward force
11.3 Cross Products and Determinants                                                    487

F cos  and a turning force F sin : The turning force times the distance R is the

moment R F sin :

 The moment gives the magnitude and sign of the torque vector T D R ¢ F. The

direction of T is along the axis of rotation, at right angles to R and F:

EXAMPLE 3 Does the cross product go up or down ? Use the right-hand rule.

Forces and torques are probably just fine for physicists. Those who are not natural
physicists want to see something turn. We can visualize a record or compact disc
rotating around its axis--which comes up through the center.

  At a point on the disc, you give a push. When the push is outward (hard to do),
nothing turns. Rotation comes from force "around" the axis. The disc can turn
either way--depending on the angle between force and position. A sign convention
is necessary, and it is the right-hand rule:

A ¢ B points along your right thumb when the fingers curl from A toward B:

This rule is simplest for the vectors i; j; k in Figure 11.14--which is all we need.

  Suppose the fingers curl from i to j: The thumb points along k: The x-y-z axes

form a "right-handed triple." Since i D 1 and j D 1 and sin =2 D 1, the length

of i ¢ j is 1: The cross product is i ¢ j D k. The disc turns counterclockwise--its

angular velocity is up--when the force acts at i in the direction j:

  Figure 11.14b reverses i and j: The force acts at j and its direction is i: The disc

turns clockwise (the way records and compact discs actually turn). When the fingers

curl from j to i, the thumb points down. Thus j ¢ i D ¡k: This is a special case of an

amazing rule:

The cross product is anticommutative: B ¢ A D ¡.A ¢ B/:  (3)

That is quite remarkable. Its discovery by Hamilton produced an intellectual
revolution in 19 th century algebra, which had been totally accustomed to AB D BA:

This commutative law is old and boring for numbers (it is new and boring for dot

products). Here we see its opposite for vector products A ¢ B: Neither law holds for

matrix products.

EXAMPLE 4 A screw goes into a wall or out, following the right-hand rule.
The disc was in the xy plane. So was the force. (We are not breaking records here.)
The axis was up and down. To see the cross product more completely we need to
turn a screw into a wall.

   Figure 11.14b shows the xz plane as the wall. The screw is in the y direction. By
turning from x toward z we drive the screw into the wall--which is the negative y

     direction. In other words i ¢ k equals minus j: We turn the screw clockwise to make
     it go in. To take out the screw, twist from k toward i: Then k ¢ i equals plus j:
     To summarize: k ¢ i D j and j ¢ k D i have plus signs because kij and jki are in the

     same "cyclic order" as ijk: (Anticyclic is minus.) The z-x-y and y-z-x axes form
     righthanded triples like x-y-z:

                             THE FORMULA FOR THE CROSS PRODUCT

     We begin the algebra of A ¢ B: It is essential for computation, and it comes out
     beautifully. The square roots in A B sin  will disappear in formula (6) for A ¢ B:
     (The square roots also disappeared in A ¤ B, which is A B cos : But A B tan 
     would be terrible.) Since A ¢ B is a vector we need to find three components.

        Start with the two-dimensional case. The vectors a1i C a2j and b1i C b2j are in the

     xy plane. Their cross product must go in the z direction. Therefore A ¢ B D ? k

     and there is only one nonzero component. It must be A B sin  (with the correct

     sign), but we want a better formula. There are two clean ways to compute A ¢ B,

     either by algebra (a) or by a bridge (b) to the dot product and geometry:

      (a) .a1i C a2j/ ¢ .b1i C b2j/ D a1b1i ¢ i C a1b2i ¢ j C a2b1j ¢ i C a2b2j ¢ j(:4)

     On the right are 0; a1b2k; ¡a2b1k and 0: The cross product is .a1b2 ¡ a2b1/k:
      (b) Rotate B D b1i C b2j clockwise through 90¥ into B¦ D b2i ¡ b1j: Its length is

     unchanged (and B ¤ B¦ D 0). Then A B¦ sin  equals A B¦ cos  , which is A ¤ B¦:

                                    " #"  #
     A B sin  D A ¤ B¦ D a1 a2 ¤ b2 ¡b D a1b2 1 ¡ a2b1: (5)

     11F In the xy plane, A ¢ B equals .a1b2 ¡ a2b1/k: The parallelogram with sides
                       a1b2 ¡ a2b1                               1  a1b2 ¡ a2b1
     A and B has area               : The triangle OAB has area  2               :

     EXAMPLE 5 For A D i C 2j and B D 4i C 5j the cross product is (1 ¤ 5 ¡ 2 ¤ 4)k D
     ¡3k: Area of parallelogram D 3, area of triangle D 3=2: The minus sign in A ¢ B D
     ¡3k is absent in the areas.
     Note Splitting A ¢ B into four separate cross products is correct, but it does not

     follow easily from A B sin : Method (a) is not justified until Remark 1 below.

     An algebraist would change the definition of A ¢ B to start with the distributive law

     (splitting rule) and the anticommutative law:

           A ¢ .B C C/ D .A ¢ B/ C.A ¢C/ and A ¢ B D ¡.B ¢ A/:

                      THE CROSS PRODUCT FORMULA (3 COMPONENTS)

     We move to three dimensions. The goal is to compute all three components of

     A ¢ B (not just the length). Method (a) splits each vector into its i; j; k components,

     making nine separate cross products:

     .a1i C a2j C a3k/ ¢ .b1i C b2j C b3k/ D a1b2.i ¢ i/ C a1b2.i ¢ j/ C seven more terms:

Remember i ¢ i D j ¢ j D k ¢ k D 0: Those three terms disappear. The other six

terms come in pairs, and please notice the cyclic pattern:

FORMULA A ¢ B D .a2b3 ¡ a3b2/i C .a3b1 ¡ a1b3/j C .a1b2 ¡ a2b1/k: (6)

The k component is the 2 ¢ 2 answer, when a3 D b3 D 0: The i component involves

indices 2 and 3, j involves 3 and 1, k involves 1 and 2: The cross product formula
is written as a "determinant" in equation (14) below--many people use that form to

compute A ¢ B:

2 ¤ 4/k: The i; j; k components give A ¢ B = ¡3i C 6j ¡ 3k: Never add the ¡3; 6;
and ¡3:

Remark 1 The three-dimensional formula (6) is still to be matched with A ¢ B

from geometry. One way is to rotate B into B¦ as before, staying in the plane of A

and B: Fortunately there is an easier test. The vector in equation (6) satisfies all four

geometric requirements on A ¢ B: perpendicular to A, perpendicular to B, correct

length, right-hand rule. The length is checked in Problem 16--here is the zero dot
product with A:

Remark 2 (Optional) There is a wonderful extension of the Pythagoras formula
a2 C b2 D c2: Instead of sides of a triangle, we go to areas of projections on the yz,
xz, and xy planes. 32 C 62 C 32 is the square of the parallelogram area in Example 6.

  For triangles these areas are cut in half. Figure 11.15a shows three projected
triangles of area 21 : Its Pythagoras formula is 21 2 C 21 2 C 21 2 = (area of PQR)2:

                            DETERMINANTS AND VOLUMES

     We are close to good algebra. The two plane vectors a1i C a2j and b1i C b2j are the

     sides of a parallelogram. Its area is a1b2 ¡ a2b1, possibly with a sign change. There

     is a special way to write these four numbers--in a "square matrix." There is also a

     name for the combination that leads to area. It is the "determinant of the matrix":

                      "     a2  #                                §                           §

     The matrix is

     This is a 2 by 2 matrix (notice brackets) and a 2 by 2 determinant (notice vertical
     bars). The matrix is an array of four numbers and the determinant is one number:

                                                          §  §   §                    §   §                §

     The second has no area because A D B: The third is a unit square .A D i; B D j/:
       Now move to three dimensions, where determinants are most useful. The

     parallelogram becomes a parallelepiped. The word "box" is much shorter, and we
     will use it, but remember that the box is squashed. (Like a rectangle squashed to a

     parallelogram, the angles are generally not 90¥.) The three edges from the origin are

     A D .a1; a2; a3/; B D .b1; b2; b3/; C D .c1; c2; c3/: Those edges are at right angles

     only when A ¤B D A ¤C D B ¤C D 0:

       Question: What is the volume of the box ? The right-angle case is easy--it is
     length times width times height. The volume is A times B times C , when the

     angles are 90¥. For a squashed box (Figure 11.15) we need the perpendicular height,

     not the sloping height.
       There is a beautiful formula for volume. B and C give a parallelogram in the base,

     and B ¢ C is the base area. This cross product points straight up. The third vector

     A points up at an angle--its perpendicular height is A cos : Thus the volume is

     area B ¢ C times A times cos : The volume is the dot product of A with B ¢

     C:

      11G The triple scalar product is A ¤ .B ¢ C/: Volume of box D A ¤.B ¢ C/ :
     Important: A ¤ .B ¢ C/ is a number, not a vector. This volume is zero when A is in
     the same plane as B and C (the box is totally flattened). Then B ¢ C is perpendicular

to A and their dot product is zero.

    Useful facts W A ¤ .B ¢ C/ D .A ¢ B/ ¤ C D C ¤.A ¢B/ D B¤ .C¢ A/:

All those come from the same box, with different sides chosen as base--but no change

in volume. Figure 11.15 has B and C in the base but it can be A and B or A and C:

The triple product A ¤ .C ¢ B) has opposite sign, since C ¢ B D ¡.B ¢ C). This

order ACB is not cyclic like ABC and CAB and BCA:

 To compute this triple product A ¤ .B ¢ C/, we take B ¢ C from equation (6):
    A ¤ .B ¢ C/ D a1.b2c3 ¡ b3c2/ C a2.b3c1 ¡ b1c3/ C a3.b1c2 ¡ b2c1/: (9)

The numbers a1; a2; a3 multiply 2 by 2 determinants to give a 3 by 3 determinant!

There are three terms with plus signs (like a1b2c3). The other three have minus signs

(like ¡a1b3c2). The plus terms have indices 123; 231; 312 in cyclic order. The minus

terms have anticyclic indices 132; 213; 321: Again there is a special way to write the

nine components of A; B; C--as a "3 by 3 matrix." The combination in (9), which

gives volume, is a "3 by 3 determinant:"

A single number is produced out of nine numbers, by formula .9/: The nine

numbers are multiplied three at a time, as in a1b1c2--except this product is not

allowed. Each row and column must be represented once. This gives the six terms

in the determinant:

The trick is in the ¨ signs. Products down to the right are "plus":

With practice the six products like 2 ¤ 2 ¤ 2 are done in your head. Write down only

  Note the special case when the vectors are i; j; k: The box is a unit cube:

                              §0 0 1§

  If A; B; C lie in the same plane, the volume is zero. A zero determinant is the

test to see whether three vectors lie in a plane. Here row A D row B¡ row C:

Zeros in the matrix simplify the calculation. All three products with plus signs--
down to the right--are zero. The only two nonzero products cancel each other.

      If the three ¡1's are changed to C1's, the determinant is ¡2: The determinant can

     be negative when all nine entries are positive! A negative determinant only means
     that the rows A; B; C form a "left-handed triple." This extra information from the
     sign--right-handed vs. left-handed--is free and useful, but the volume is the absolute
     value.

       The determinant yields the volume also in higher dimensions. In physics, four
     dimensions give space-time. Ten dimensions give superstrings. Mathematics uses
     all dimensions. The 64 numbers in an 8 by 8 matrix give the volume of an eight-
     dimensional box--with 8S D 40; 320 terms instead of 3S D 6: Under pressure from
     my class I omit the formula.

     Question When is the point .x; y; z/ on the plane through the origin containing B

     and C ? For the vector A D xi C yj C zk to lie in that plane, the volume A ¤ .B ¢ C/

     must be zero. The equation of the plane is determinant D zero.

      Follow this example for B D j ¡ i and C D k ¡ i to find the plane parallel to B and

     C:

     This equation is x C y C z D 0: The normal vector N D B ¢ C has components 1; 1; 1:

              THE CROSS PRODUCT AS A DETERMINANT

     There is a connection between 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 determinants that you have to see.
     The numbers in the top row multiply determinants from the other rows:

     ¡ §      §
     §§ a1 a2 a3 §§

     § c1 c2 c3 §

     The highlighted product a1.b2c3 ¡ b3c2/ gives two of the six terms. All six

     products contain an a and b and c from different columns. There are 3S D 6
     different orderings of columns 1; 2; 3: Note how a3 multiplies a determinant from
     columns 1 and 2:

       Equation (13) is identical with equations (9) and (10). We are meeting the same

     six terms in different ways. The new feature is the minus sign in front of a2--and

     the common mistake is to forget that sign. In a 4 by 4 determinant, a1; ¡a2; a3; ¡a4

     would multiply 3 by 3 determinants.

      Now comes a key step. We write A ¢ B as a determinant. The vectors i; j; k go in

     the top row, the components of A and B go in the other rows. The "determinant" is

     exactly A ¢ B:

     This time we highlighted the j component with its minus sign. There is no great
     mathematics in formula (14)--it is probably illegal to mix i; j; k with six numbers

but it works. This is the good way to remember and compute A ¢ B: In the example
.j ¡ i/ ¢ .k ¡ i/ from equation (8), those two vectors go into the last two rows:

The k component is highlighted, to see a1b2 ¡ a2b1 again. Note the change from
equation (11), which had 0; 1; ¡1 in the top row. That triple product was a number

(zero). This cross product is a vector i C j C k:

                  11.4 Matrices and Linear Equations

     We are moving from geometry to algebra. Eventually we get back to calculus, where
     functions are nonlinear--but linear equations come first. In Chapter 1, y D mx C b
     produced a line. Two equations produce two lines. If they cross, the intersection point
     solves both equations--and we want to find it.

        Three equations in three variables x; y; z produce three planes. Again they go
     through one point (usually). Again the problem is to find that intersection point
     --which solves the three equations.

        The ultimate problem is to solve n equations in n unknowns. There are n
     hyperplanes in n-dimensional space, which meet at the solution. We need a test to
     be sure they meet. We also want the solution. These are the objectives of linear
     algebra, which joins with calculus at the center of pure and applied mathematics.

        Like every subject, linear algebra requires a good notation. To state the equations
     and solve them, we introduce a "matrix." The problem will be Au D d: The solution

     will be u D A¡1d. It remains to understand where the equations come from, where
     the answer comes from, and what the matrices A and A¡1 stand for.

                                 TWO EQUATIONS IN TWO UNKNOWNS

     Linear algebra has no reason to choose one variable as special. The equation y ¡
     y0 D m.x ¡ x0/ separates y from x: A better equation for a line is ax C by D d:

     (A vertical line like x D 5 appears when b D 0: The first form did not allow slope
     m D :) This section studies two lines:

                                            a1 x C b1 y D d1
                                                                                                   (1)

                                            a2 x C b2 y D d2:

     By solving both equations at once, we are asking .x; y/ to lie on both lines. The
     practical question is: Where do the lines cross ? The mathematician's question is:
     Does a solution exist and is it unique ?

        To understand everything is not possible. There are parts of life where you never
     know what is going on (until too late). But two equations in two unknowns can have
     no mysteries. There are three ways to write the system--by rows, by columns, and
     by matrices. Please look at all three, since setting up a problem is generally harder
     and more important than solving it. After that comes the concession to the real world:
     we compute x and y:

     EXAMPLE 1 How do you invest $5000 to earn $400 a year interest, if a money
     market account pays 5% and a deposit account pays 10% ?

     Set up equations by rows: With x dollars at 5% the interest is .05x: With y dollars
     at 10% the interest is .10y: One row for principal, another row for interest:

                                             x C y D 5000
                                                                                                   (2)

      Linear algebra dominates some applications while calculus governs others. Both are
     essential. A fuller treatment is presented in the author's book Linear Algebra and Its
     Applications (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 3rd edition 1988), and in many other texts.

                      " # " #" #
                      1           1         5000
                   x       Cy        D               :                      (3)
                      :05      :10          400

Same equations by matrices: Look again at the left side. There are two unknowns

x and y; which go into a vector u: They are multiplied by the four numbers 1; .05; 1;

and .10; which go into a two by two matrix A: The left side becomes a matrix times

a vector:             "        #" # " #

                Au D       11 x          D  5000        :                   (4)

                         :05 :10 y              400

Now you see where the "rows" and "columns" came from. They are the rows and
columns of a matrix. The rows entered the separate equations (2). The columns
entered the vector equation (3). The matrix-vector multiplication Au is defined so
that all these equations are the same:

                "        #" # "      a1x C b1y  #
                   a1 b1 x
Au by rows:                    D                           (each row is
                   a2 b2 y           a2x C b2y             a dot product)

                "        #" # " # " #
                   a1 b1 x           a1         b1
Au by columns:                 Dx        Cy                (combination of
                   a2 b2 y           a2         b2         column vectors)

A is the coefficient matrix. The unknown vector is u: The known vector on the right
side, with components 5000 and 400; is d: The matrix equation is Au D d:

Fig. 11.16 Each row of Au D d gives a line. Each column gives a vector.

  This notation Au D d continues to apply when there are more equations and more
unknowns. The matrix A has a row for each equation (usually m rows). It has a
column for each unknown (usually n columns). For 2 equations in 3 unknowns it is
a 2 by 3 matrix (therefore rectangular). For 6 equations in 6 unknowns the matrix is
6 by 6 (therefore square). The best way to get familiar with matrices is to work with
them. Note also the pronunciation: "matrisees" and never "matrixes."

Answer to the practical question The solution is x D 2000; y D 3000: That is the
intersection point in the row picture (Figure 11.16). It is also the correct combination
in the column picture. The matrix equation checks both at once, because matrices are
multiplied by rows or by columns. The product either way is d:

" 1 1 # "2000# " 2000 C 3000# "5000#
                      D                                 D       D d:

498                  11 Vectors and Matrices

     Singular case In the row picture, the lines cross at the solution. But there is a case
     that gives trouble. When the lines are parallel, they never cross and there is no
     solution. When the lines are the same, there is an infinity of solutions:

     parallel lines  2x C y D 0  same line  2x C y D 0                                   (5)

                     2x C y D 1             4x C 2y D 0

     This trouble also appears in the column picture. The columns are vectors a and b: The
     equation Au D d is the same as xa C yb D d: We are asked to find the combination
     of a and b (with coefficients x and y) that produces d: In the singular case a and
     b lie along the same line (Figure 11.17). No combination can produce d; unless it

     happens to lie on this line.

     The crossing point is .1; 1/ in the row picture. The solution is x D 1; y D 1 in the
     column picture (Figure 11.17b). Then 1 times a plus 1 times b equals the right side
     d:

                                      SOLUTION BY DETERMINANTS

     Up to now we just wrote down the answer. The real problem is to find x and y when
     they are unknown. We solve two equations with letters not numbers:

                     a1x C b1y D d1
                     a2x C b2y D d2:

     The key is to eliminate x: Multiply the first equation by a2 and the second equation
     by a1: Subtract the first from the second and the x's disappear:

     .a1b2 ¡ a2b1/y D .a1d2 ¡ a2d1/:                                                     (6)

     To eliminate y; subtract b1; times the second equation from b2 times the first:

     .b2a1 ¡ b1a2/x D .b2d1 ¡ b1d2/:                                                     (7)

What you see in those parentheses are 2 by 2 determinants! Remember from
Section 11:3:

This number appears on the left side of (6) and (7). The right side of (7) is also a
determinant--but it has d 's in place of a's. The right side of (6) has d 's in place of
b's. So x and y are ratios of determinants, given by Cramer's Rule:

The investment example is solved by three determinants from the three columns:

Cramer's Rule has x D 100=:05 D 2000 and y D 150=:05 D 3000: This is the solu-
tion. The singular case is when the determinant of A is zero--and we can't divide by
it.

11I Cramer's Rule breaks down when det A D 0--which is the singular case.
Then the lines in the row picture are parallel, and one column is a multiple of
the other column.

EXAMPLE 3  The lines 2x C y D 0; 2x C y D 1 are parallel. The determinant is
zero:

The lines in Figure 11.17a don't meet. Notice the columns: 2  2  is a multiple of 1  1 :
  One final comment on 2 by 2 systems. They are small enough so that all solution

methods apply. Cramer's Rule uses determinants. Larger systems use elimination
(3 by 3 matrices are on the borderline). A third solution (the same solution!) comes

from the inverse matrix A¡1; to be described next. But the inverse is more a symbol
for the answer than a new way of computing it, because to find A¡1 we still use

determinants or elimination.

                                   THE INVERSE OF A MATRIX

The symbol A¡1 is pronounced "A inverse." It stands for a matrix--the one that
solves Au D d: I think of A as a matrix that takes u to d: Then A¡1 is a matrix that
takes d back to u: If Au D d then u D A¡1d (provided the inverse exists). This is
exactly like functions and inverse functions: g.x/ D y and x D g¡1.y/: Our goal is
to find A¡1 when we know A:
500                       11 Vectors and Matrices

       The first approach will be very direct. Cramer's Rule gave formulas for

     x and y; the components of u: From that rule we can read off A¡1; assuming that

     D D a1b2 ¡ a2b1 is not zero. D is det A and we divide by it:

               1 " b2d1 ¡ b1d2 #                               "  ¡b1 # "d1 #
     Cramer: u D D ¡a2d1 C a1d2
                                        This is A¡1d D 1 b2         a1 d2

                                                    D ¡a2

                                                                                                   (8)

     The matrix on the right (including 1=D in all four entries) is A¡1: Notice the sign

     pattern and the subscript pattern. The inverse exists if D is not zero--this is

     important. Then the solution comes from a matrix-vector multiplication, A¡1 times

     d: We repeat the rules for that multiplication:

     DEFINITION A matrix M times a vector v equals a vector of dot products:

                               "row 1# " # "(row 1) ¤ v#
                          M v D row 2 v D (row 2) ¤ v : (9)

     Equation (8) follows this rule with M D A¡1 and v D d: Look at Example 1:

          "          #    det A D :05;               "        ¡1# " 2   ¡20 #
              1   1                                            1 D ¡1
                                        A¡1 D 1 :10 :05 ¡:05                   :
     AD                ;                                                  20
            :05  :10

     There stands the inverse matrix. It multiplies d to give the solution u:

       A¡1 " d D 2 ¡20# "5000# " D .2/.5000/¡ .20/.400/# " D 2000# :
               ¡1 20 400 .¡1/.5000/C .20/.400/ 3000

     The formulas work perfectly, but you have to see a direct way to reach A¡1d: Mul-
     tiply both sides of Au D d by A¡1. The multiplication "cancels" A on the left side,
     and leaves u D A¡1d: This approach comes next.

                                          MATRIX MULTIPLICATION

     To understand the power of matrices, we must multiply them. The product of A¡1

     with Au is a matrix times a vector. But that multiplication can be done another way.

     First A¡1 multiplies A; a matrix times a matrix. The product A¡1A is another matrix

     (a very special matrix). Then this new matrix multiplies u:
       The matrix-matrix rule comes directly from the matrix-vector rule. Effectively, a

     vector v is a matrix V with only one column. When there are more columns, M times
     V splits into separate matrix-vector multiplications, side by side:

     DEFINITION A matrix M times a matrix V equals a matrix of dot products:

                 " #"                   # "(row 1) ¤ v1 (row 1) ¤ v2 #
                   row 1
                 M V D row 2 v1 v2 D (row 2) ¤ v1 (row 2) ¤ v2 : (10)

This identity matrix is denoted by I: It has 1's on the diagonal and 0's off the diagonal.

It acts like the number 1: Every vector satisfies I u D u:

The next section moves to three equations. The algebra gets more complicated (and

4 by 4 is worse). It is not easy to write out A¡1: So we stay longer with the 2 by 2

formulas, where each step can be checked. Multiplying Au D d by the inverse matrix

gives A¡1Au D A¡1d--and the left side is I u D u:

     Historical note I was amazed to learn that it was Leibniz (again!) who proposed
     the notation we use for matrices. The entry in row i and column j is aij : The
     identity matrix has a11 D a22 D 1 and a12 D a21 D 0: This is in a linear algebra book
     by Charles Dodgson--better known to the world as Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice

     in Wonderland. I regret to say that he preferred his own notation i j instead of aij :

     "I have turned the symbol toward the left, to avoid all chance of confusion with :"

     It drove his typesetter mad.

     PROJECTION ONTO A PLANE D LEAST SQUARES FITTING BY A LINE

     We close with a genuine application. It starts with three-dimensional vectors a; b; d
     and leads to a 2 by 2 system. One good feature: a; b; d can be n-dimensional with
     no change in the algebra. In practice that happens. Second good feature: There is a
     calculus problem in the background. The example is to fit points by a straight line.

       There are three ways to state the problem, and they look different:

     1. Solve xa C yb D d as well as possible (three equations, two unknowns x and y).
     2. Project the vector d onto the plane of the vectors a and b:
     3. Find the closest straight line ("least squares") to three given points.

     Figure 11.19 shows a three-dimensional vector d above the plane of a and b: Its

     projection onto the plane is p D xa C yb: The numbers x and y are unknown, and

     our goal is to find them. The calculation will use the dot product, which is always the

     key to right angles.

      The difference d ¡ p is the "error." There has to be an error, because no combina-

     tion of a and b can produce d exactly. (Otherwise d is in the plane.) The projection

     p is the closest point to d; and it is governed by one fundamental law: The error is

     perpendicular to the plane. That makes the error perpendicular to both vectors a

     and b:      a ¤.xa C yb ¡ d/ D 0 and b ¤ .xa C yb ¡ d/ D 0:

                                                                                    (13)

     Rewrite those as two equations for the two unknown numbers x and y:

                    .a ¤a/x C .a ¤b/y D a ¤d
                    .b ¤ a/x C .b ¤b/y D b ¤ d: (14)

     These are the famous normal equations in statistics, to compute x and y and p:

     EXAMPLE 7 For a D .1; 1; 1/ and b D .1; 2; 3/ and d D .0; 5; 4/; solve equation (14):

     6x C 14y D 22  yD 2

     Notice the three equations that we are not solving (we can't): xa C yb D d is

                 xC yD0                                 21 13

For d D .0; 5; 4/ there is no solution; d is not in the plane of a and b: For p D .1; 3; 5/

there is a solution, x D ¡1 and y D 2: The vector p is in the plane. The error d ¡ p
is .¡1; 2; ¡1/: This error is perpendicular to the columns .1; 1; 1/ and .1; 2; 3/; so it

is perpendicular to their plane.

SAME EXAMPLE (written as a line-fitting problem) Fit the points .1; 0/ and .2; 5/
and .3; 4/ as closely as possible ("least squares") by a straight line.

Two points determine a line. The example asks the line f D x C yt to go through
three points. That gives the three equations in (15), which can't be solved with two
unknowns. We have to settle for the closest line, drawn in Figure 11.19b. This line is
computed again below, by calculus.

  Notice that the closest line has heights 1; 3; 5 where the data points have heights
0; 5; 4: Those are the numbers in p and d! The heights 1; 3; 5 fit onto a line; the
heights 0; 5; 4 do not. In the first figure, p D .1; 3; 5/ is in the plane and d D .0; 5; 4/
is not. Vectors in the plane lead to heights that lie on a line.

 Notice another coincidence. The coefficients x D ¡1 and y D 2 give the projection
¡a C 2b: They also give the closest line f D ¡1 C 2t: All numbers appear in both

figures.

Fig. 11.19  Projection onto plane is .1; 3; 5/ with coefficients ¡1; 2: Closest line has heights
            1; 3; 5 with coefficients ¡1; 2: Error in both pictures is ¡1; 2; ¡1:

Remark Finding the closest line is a calculus problem: Minimize a sum of squares.

The numbers x and y that minimize E give the least squares solution:

            E.x; y/ D .x C y ¡ 0/2 C .x C 2y ¡ 5/2 C .x C 3y ¡ 4/2:   (16)

Those are the three errors in equation (15), squared and added. They are also the
three errors in the straight line fit, between the line and the data points. The projection
minimizes the error (by geometry), the normal equations (14) minimize the error (by
algebra), and now calculus minimizes the error by setting the derivatives of E to zero.

  The new feature is this: E depends on two variables x and y: Therefore E has two
derivatives. They both have to be zero at the minimum. That gives two equations for
x and y:

 x derivative of E is zero: 2.x C y/ C 2.x C 2y ¡ 5/ C2.x C 3y ¡ 4/ D 0
 y derivative of E is zero: 2.x C y/ C 2.x C 2y ¡ 5/.2/C2.x C 3y ¡ 4/.3/D 0:

When we divide by 2; those are the normal equations 3x C 6y D 9 and 6x C 14y D

22: The minimizing x and y from calculus are the same numbers ¡1 and 2:
504            11 Vectors and Matrices

        The x derivative treats y as a constant. The y derivative treats x as a constant. These
      are partial derivatives. This calculus approach to least squares is in Chapter 13, as
      an important application of partial derivatives.

        We now summarize the least squares problem--to find the closest line to n data
      points. In practice n may be 1000 instead of 3: The points have horizontal coordinates
      b1; b2; : : : ; bn: The vertical coordinates are d1; d2; : : :; dn: These vectors b and d;
      together with a D .1; 1; : : :; 1/; determine a projection--the combination p D xa C
      yb

      that is closest to d: This problem is the same in n dimensions--the error d ¡ p is
      perpendicular to a and b: That is still tested by dot products, p ¤ a D d ¤ a and p ¤ b D
      d ¤ b; which give the normal equations for x and y:

      .a ¤a/x C .a ¤b/y D a ¤d                                      .n/ x C . bi /y D  di

      .b ¤ a/x C .b ¤ b/y D b ¤ d . bi /x C . bi or 2/y D  bi di : (17)

      11K The least squares problem projects d onto the plane of a and b: The
      projection is p D xa C yb; in n dimensions. The closest line f D x C yt; in two
      dimensions. The normal equations (17) give the best x and y:

11.5 Linear Algebra

This section moves from two to three dimensions. There are three unknowns x; y; z
and also three equations. This is at the crossover point between formulas and
algorithms--it is real linear algebra. The formulas give a direct solution using
determinants. The algorithms use elimination and the numbers x; y; z appear at the
end. In practice that end result comes quickly. Computers solve linear equations by
elimination.

  The situation for a nonlinear equation is similar. Quadratic equations
ax2 C bx C c D 0 are solved by a formula. Cubic equations are solved by Newton's
method (even though a formula exists). For equations involving x5 or x10, algorithms
take over completely.

  Since we are at the crossover point, we look both ways. This section has a lot to do,
in mixing geometry, determinants, and 3 by 3 matrices:

  1: The row picture: three planes intersect at the solution
  2: The column picture: a vector equation combines the columns
  3: The formulas: determinants and Cramer's Rule

  4: Matrix multiplication and A¡1

  5: The algorithm: Gaussian elimination.

Part of our goal is three-dimensional calculus. Another part is n-dimensional algebra.
And a third possibility is that you may not take mathematics next year. If that happens,
I hope you will use mathematics. Linear equations are so basic and important, in such
a variety of applications, that the effort in this section is worth making.

  An example is needed. It is convenient and realistic if the matrix contains zeros.
Most equations in practice are fairly simple--a thousand equations each with 990
zeros would be very reasonable. Here are three equations in three unknowns:

xC y D 1

x C 2z D 0           (1)

¡2y C 2z D ¡ 4:

In matrix-vector form, the unknown u has components x; y; z: The right sides 1; 0; ¡4

go into d: The nine coefficients, including three zeros, enter the matrix A:

                     21 1 032x3 2 13
                     461 0 25 4 7 6y 57 D 46 057 or Au D d: (2)

              0 ¡2 2 z ¡4

The goal is to understand that system geometrically, and then solve it.

                       THE ROW PICTURE: INTERSECTING PLANES

Start with the first equation x C y D 1: In the xy plane that produces a line. In three
dimensions it is a plane. It has the usual form ax C by C cz D d , except that c hap-
pens to be zero. The plane is easy to visualize (Figure 11.20a), because it cuts straight
down through the line. The equation x C y D 1 allows z to have any value, so the
graph includes all points above and below the line.

  The second equation x C 2z D 0 gives a second plane, which goes through the
origin. When the right side is zero, the point .0; 0; 0/ satisfies the equation. This
time y is absent from the equation, so the plane contains the whole y axis. All points
508                                  11 Vectors and Matrices

     .0; y; 0/ meet the requirement x C 2z D 0: The normal vector to the plane is N D
     i C 2k: The plane cuts across, rather than down, in 11.20b.

       Before the third equation we combine the first two. The intersection of two planes
     is a line. In three-dimensional space, two equations (not one) describe a line. The
     points on the line have to satisfy x C y D 1 and also x C 2z D 0: A convenient point

     is P D .0; 1; 0/: Another point is Q D .¡1; 2; 12 /: The line through P and Q extends

     out in both directions.
       The solution is on that line. The third plane decides where.

         Fig. 11.20 First plane, second plane, interesection line meets third plane at solution.

      The third equation ¡2y C 2z D ¡4 gives the third plane--which misses the origin

     because the right side is not zero. What is important is the point where the three
     planes meet. The intersection line of the first two planes crosses the third plane.

     We used determinants (but elimination is better) to find x D ¡2; y D 3; z D 1: This

     solution satisfies the three equations and lies on the three planes.

      A brief comment on 4 by 4 systems. The first equation might be x C y C z ¡ t D 0:

     It represents a three-dimensional "hyperplane" in four-dimensional space. (In
     physics this is space-time.) The second equation gives a second hyperplane, and
     its intersection with the first one is two-dimensional. The third equation (third
     hyperplane) reduces the intersection to a line. The fourth hyperplane meets that line
     at a point, which is the solution. It satisfies the four equations and lies on the four
     hyperplanes. In this course three dimensions are enough.

     COLUMN PICTURE: COMBINATION OF COLUMN VECTORS

     There is an extremely important way to rewrite our three equations. In (1) they were
     separate, in (2) they went into a matrix. Now they become a vector equation:

     213 2 13 203 2 13

     x 46157 C y 46 057 C z 46257 D 46 057 : (3)
        ¡2  2 ¡4
     0

     The columns of the matrix are multiplied by x; y; z: That is a special way to see
     matrix-vector multiplication: Au is a combination of the columns of A: We are
     looking for the numbers x; y; z so that the combination produces the right side d:

       The column vectors a; b; c are shown in Figure 11.21a. The vector equation is

     xa C yb C zc D d: The combination that solves this equation must again be x D ¡2,

     y D 3; z D 1: That agrees with the intersection point of the three planes in the row

     picture.

              THE DETERMINANT AND THE INVERSE MATRIX

For a 3 by 3 determinant, the section on cross products gave two formulas. One was

the triple product a ¤ .b ¢ c/: The other wrote out the six terms:
  det A D a ¤.b ¢ c/ D a1.b2c3 ¡ b3c2/ C a2.b3c1 ¡ b1c3/ C a3.b1c2 ¡ b2c1/:

Geometrically this is the volume of a box. The columns a; b; c are the edges going

out from the origin. In our example the determinant and volume are 2:

§  §§         §
§§ a1 b1 c1 § § § §1 1 0 §§
                                 .1/.0/.2/ ¡ .1/.¡2/.2/ C .1/.¡2/.0/
§  §§         §
§a2 b2 c2 § D §1 0 2 § D         ¡.1/.1/.2/ C .0/.1/.2/ ¡ .0/.0/.0/ D 2:
§  §          §§0 ¡2 2 §§
§ a3 b3 c3 §

  A slight dishonesty is present in that calculation, and will be admitted now. In
Section 11.3 the vectors A; B; C were rows. In this section a; b; c are columns. It

doesn't matter, because the determinant is the same either way. Any matrix can be

"transposed" --exchanging rows for columns--without altering the determinant. The
six terms (a1b2c3 is the first) may come in a different order, but they are the same six
terms. Here four of those terms are zero, because of the zeros in the matrix. The sum
of all six terms is D D det A D 2:

  Since D is not zero, the equations can be solved. The three planes meet at a point.
The column vectors a; b; c produce a genuine box, and are not flattened into the same
plane (with zero volume). The solution involves dividing by D--which is only
possible if D D det A is not zero.

   11L When the determinant D is not zero, A bas an inverse: AA¡1 D A¡1
   A D I: Then the equations Au D d have one and only one solution u D A¡1d:

The 3 by 3 identity matrix I is at the end of equation (5). Always I u D u:

  We now compute A¡1; first with letters and then with numbers. The neatest formula

uses cross products of the columns of A--it is special for 3 by 3 matrices.

                                 The inverse matrix is A¡1 D  1  2 b¢c 3
                                                                       c¢a
   Every entry is divided by D:                                  6           57 :  (4)
                                                                 4
                                                              D a¢b

To test this formula, multiply by A: Matrix multiplication produces a matrix of

dot products--from the rows of the first matrix and the columns of the second, A¡1A D
510              11 Vectors and Matrices

     I:

         2b¢c32  3 2a ¤.b¢c/ b¤.b¢c/ c ¤.b¢c/ 3 21 0 03

                                                                                           (5)

     On the right side, six of the triple products are zero. They are the off-diagonals like

     b ¤ .b ¢ c/, which contain the same vector twice. Since b ¢ c is perpendicular to b,
     this triple product is zero. The same is true of the others, like a ¤ .a ¢ b/ D 0: That

     is the volume of a box with two identical sides. The six off-diagonal zeros are the

     volumes of completely flattened boxes.

         On the main diagonal the triple products equal D: The order of vectors can be

     abc or bca or cab, and the volume of the box stays the same. Dividing by this number

     D, which is placed outside for that purpose, gives the 1's in the identity matrix I:

       Now we change to numbers. The goal is to find A¡1 and to test it.

     EXAMPLE 1                         21 1  03 2 4 ¡2 23
                The inverse of A D 461 0     257 is A¡1 D 1 64¡2 2 ¡275 :
                                             2 2 ¡2 2 ¡1
                                0 ¡2

     That comes from the formula, and it absolutely has to be checked. Do not fail to

     multiply A¡1 times A (or A times A¡1). Matrix multiplication is much easier than
     the formula for A¡1: We highlight row 3 times column 1, with dot product zero:

      2 4 ¡2 2321 1 03 2 4 ¡ 2 4 ¡ 4 ¡4 C 43 21 0 03
     4 1 6¡2 2 ¡25 4 7 61 0 257 D 4 1 6¡2 C 2 ¡2 C 4 4 ¡ 457 D 460 1 057 :
     2 ¡2 2 ¡1 0 ¡2 2 2 ¡2 C 2 ¡2 C 2 4 ¡2 0 0 1

     Remark on A¡1 Inverting a matrix requires D ¤ 0: We divide by D D det A: The

     cross products b ¢ c and c ¢ a and a ¢ b give A¡1 in a neat form, but errors are easy.

     We prefer to avoid writing i; j; k: There are nine 2 by 2 determinants to be calculated,

     and here is A¡1 in full--containing the nine "cofactors" divided by D:

                2 b2c3 ¡ b3c2 b3c1 ¡ b1c3 b1c2 ¡ b2c1 3
         A¡1 D 4 1 6 c2a3 ¡ c3a2 c3a1 ¡ c1a3 c1a2 ¡ c2a1 57 : (6)

              D a2b3 ¡ a3b2 a3b1 ¡ a1b3 a1b2 ¡ a2b1

     Important: The first row of A¡1 does not use the first column of A, except in 1=D:

     In other words, b ¢ c does not involve a: Here are the 2 by 2 determinants that produce
     4; ¡2; 2--which is divided by D D 2 in the top row of A¡1:

         21 1 0321 1 0321 1 03 2C ¡ C3
         461 0 25 4 7 61 0 25 4 7 61 0 25 4 7 6 ¡ C ¡57 : (7)
         0 ¡2 2 0 ¡2 2 0 ¡2 2                C¡C

     The second highlighted determinant looks like C2 not ¡2: But the sign matrix on
     the right assigns a minus to that position in A¡1: We reverse the sign of b1c3 ¡ b3c1,
     to find the cofactor b3c1 ¡ b1c3 in the top row of (6).

       To repeat: For a row of A¡1; cross out the corresponding column of A: Find

     the three 2 by 2 determinants, use the sign matrix, and divide by D:

The multiplication BB¡1 D I  checks the arithmetic. Notice how  1  1  in B  leads to a
zero in the top row of B¡1: To find row 1, column 3 of B¡1 we ignore column 1 and11

row 3 of B: (Also: the inverse of a triangular matrix is triangular.) The minus signs

come from the sign matrix.

                            THE SOLUTION u D A¡1d

The purpose of A¡1 is to solve the equation Au D d: Multiplying by A¡1 produces
I u D A¡1d: The matrix becomes the identity, I u equals u, and the solution is

immediate:

                             2 b¢c 32 3 2 d¤.b¢c/3
u D A¡1d D 4 1 6 c ¢ a 5 4 7 6d57 D 4 1 6 d ¤ .c ¢ a/ 57 : (9)
                            D a¢b       D d¤.a ¢b/

By writing those components x; y; z as ratios of determinants, we have Cramer's Rule:

11M (Cramer's Rule)

The solution is x D          dbc  ; yD  adc  ; zD  abd                : (10)

                             abc        abc        abc

The right side d replaces, in turn, columns a and b and c: All denominators are

D D a ¤ .b ¢ c/: The numerator of x is the determinant d ¤ .b ¢ c/ in (9). The second
numerator agrees with the second component d ¤ .c ¢ a/, because the cyclic order is
correct. The third determinant with columns abd equals the triple product d ¤ .a ¢ b/

in A¡1u: Thus (10) is the same as (9).

     This rule fills the page with determinants. Those are good ones to check by eye,

     without writing down the six terms (three C and three ¡).

       The formulas for A¡1 are honored chiefly in their absence. They are not used by

     the computer, even though the algebra is in some ways beautiful. In big calculations,

     the computer never finds A¡1--just the solution.

       We now look at the singular case D D 0: Geometry-algebra-algorithm must all
     break down. After that is the algorithm: Gaussian elimination.

                                  THE SINGULAR CASE

     Changing one entry of a matrix can make the determinant zero. The triple product

     a ¤ .b ¢ c/, which is also the volume, becomes D D 0: The box is flattened and the

     matrix is singular. That happens in our example when the lower right entry is changed

     from 2 to 4:       21 1 03

                            S D 461 0 257 has determinant D D 0:

                        0 ¡2 4

     This does more than change the inverse. It destroys the inverse. We can no longer

     divide by D: There is no S ¡1:

       What happens to the row picture and column picture ? For 2 by 2 systems, the
     singular case had two parallel lines. Now the row picture has three planes, which
     need not be parallel. Here the planes are not parallel. Their normal vectors are the
     rows of S , which go in different directions. But somehow the planes fail to go through
     a common point.

       What happens is more subtle. The intersection line from two planes misses the third
     plane. The line is parallel to the plane and stays above it (Figure 11.22)a. When all
     three planes are drawn, they form an open tunnel. The picture tells more than the
     numbers, about how three planes can fail to meet. The third figure shows an end view,
     where the planes go directly into the page. Each pair meets in a line, but those lines
     don't meet in a point.

           Fig. 11.22 The row picture in the singular case: no interestion point, no solutions.

       When two planes are parallel, the determinant is again zero. One row of the matrix
     is a multiple of another row. The extreme case has all three planes parallel--as in a
     matrix with nine 1's.
          11.5 Linear Algebra                                                             513

  The column picture must also break down. In the 2 by 2 failure (previous section),
the columns were on the same line. Now the three columns are in the same plane.
The combinations of those columns produce d only if it happens to lie in that particu-
lar plane. Most vectors d will be outside the plane, so most singular systems have no
solution.

  When the determinant is zero, Au D d has no solution or infinitely many.

                                 THE ELIMINATION ALGORITHM

Go back to the 3 by 3 example Au D d: If you were given those equations, you
would never think of determinants. You would--quite correctly--start with the first

equation. It gives x D 1 ¡ y, which goes into the next equation to eliminate x:

          xC y D 1         x D 1¡y  1 ¡ y C 2z D 0
                                     ¡ 2y C 2z D ¡4:
          x C 2z D 0

           ¡ 2y C 2z D ¡4

Stop there for a minute. On the right is a 2 by 2 system for y and z: The first
equation and first unknown are eliminated--exactly what we want. But that step was
not organized in the best way, because a "1" ended up on the left side. Constants
should stay on the right side--the pattern should be preserved. It is better to take the
same step by subtracting the first equation from the second:

          xC y D 1

          x C 2z D 0 ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡ y C 2z D ¡1                            (11)

          ¡ 2y C 2z D ¡4            ¡ 2y C 2z D ¡4:

Same equations, better organization. Now look at the corner term ¡y: Its coefficient
¡1 is the second pivot. (The first pivot was C1, the coefficient of x in the first

corner.) We are ready for the next elimination step:

   Plan:  Subtract a multiple of the "pivot equation" from the equation below it.
   Goal:  To produce a zero below the pivot, so y is eliminated.
Method:
          Subtract 2 times the pivot equation to cancel ¡2y:

          ¡ y C 2z D ¡1 (12)
          ¡ 2y C 2z D ¡4 ¡2z D ¡2:

The answer comes by back substitution. Equation (12) gives z D 1: Then equation

(11) gives y D 3: Then the first equation gives x D ¡2: This is much quicker than

determinants. You may ask: Why use Cramer's Rule ? Good question.

  With numbers elimination is better. It is faster and also safer. (To check against

error, substitute ¡2; 3; 1 into the original equations.) The algorithm reaches the

answer without the determinant and without the inverse. Calculations with letters

use det A and A¡1:

  Here are the steps in a definite order (top to bottom):

Subtract a multiple of equation 1 to produce 0x in equation 2
Subtract a multiple of equation 1 to produce 0x in equation 3
Subtract a multiple of equation 2 (new) to produce 0y in equation 3.

     EXAMPLE (notice the zeros appearing under the pivots):

     Elimination leads to a triangular system. The coefficients below the diagonal are

     zero.

     First z D 2, then y D 1, then x D ¡2: Back substitution solves triangular systems

     (fast).

       As a final example, try the singular case S u D d when the corner entry is changed

     from 2 to 4: With D D 0, there is no inverse matrix S ¡1: Elimination also fails, by

     reaching an impossible equation 0 D ¡2:

     xC y  D1           xC y                                        D1  xCy  D1

     x C 2z D 0         ¡ y C 2z D ¡1                                   ¡ y C 2z D ¡1
                        ¡ 2y C 4z D ¡4                                        0 D ¡2
      ¡2y C 4z D ¡4

     The three planes do not meet at a point--a fact that was not obvious at the start.

     Algebra discovers this fact from D D 0: Elimination discovers it from 0 D ¡2: The

     chapter is ending at the point where my linear algebra book begins.
       One final comment. In actual computing, you will use a code written by

     professionals. The steps will be the same as above. A multiple of equation 1 is
     subtracted from each equation below it, to eliminate the first unknown x: With one
     fewer unknown and equation, elimination starts again. (A parallel computer executes
     many steps at once.) Extra instructions are included to reduce roundoff error. You
     only see the result! But it is more satisfying to know what the computer is doing.

       In the end, solving linear equations is the key step in solving nonlinear equations.
     The central idea of differential calculus is to linearize near a point.

       Motion Along a Curve

                      12.1 The Position Vector

This chapter is about "vector functions." The vector 2i C 4j C 8k is constant. The
vector R.t /D t i C t 2j C t 3k is moving. It is a function of the parameter t , which

often represents time. At each time t , the position vector R.t / locates the moving

body:

       position vector D R.t/ D x.t/i C y.t/j C z.t/k:                     (1)

Our example has x D t; y D t 2; z D t 3. As t varies, these points trace out a curve
in space. The parameter t tells when the body passes each point on the curve. The
constant vector 2i C 4j C 8k is the position vector R.2/ at the instant t D 2.

  What are the questions to be asked ? Every student of calculus knows the first
question: Find the derivative. If something moves, the Navy salutes it and we
differentiate it. At each instant, the body moving along the curve has a speed and
a direction. This information is contained in another vector function--the velocity
vector v.t / which is the derivative of R.t /:

                      v.t/ D d R D dx i C dy j C dz k: (2)
                               dt dt dt dt

Since i; j; k are fixed vectors, their derivatives are zero. In polar coordinates i and j

are replaced by moving vectors. Then the velocity v has more terms from the product

rule (Section 12:4).

Two important cases are uniform motion along a line and around a circle. We

study those motions in detail (v D constant on line, v D tangent to circle). This section

also finds the speed and distance and acceleration for any motion R.t /.

Equation (2) is the computing rule for the velocity d R=dt . It is not the definition

of d R=dt , which goes back to basics and does not depend on coordinates:

       d R D lim R D lim R.t C t/ ¡ R.t/:
                      dt t 0 t t 0  t

We repeat: R is a vector so R is a vector so d R=dt is a vector. All three vectors are     517
in Figure 12.1 (t is not a vector!). This figure reveals the key fact about the geometry:
The velocity v D d R=dt is tangent to the curve.
518                                  12 Motion Along a Curve

       The vector R goes from one point on the curve to a nearby point. Dividing by
     t changes its length, not its direction. That direction lines up with the tangent to
     the curve, as the points come closer.

     EXAMPLE 1 R.t / D t i C t 2j C t 3k v.t / D i C 2t j C 3t 2k
     This curve swings upward as t increases. When t D 0 the velocity is v D i. The tan-
     gent is along the x axis, since the j and k components are zero. When t D 1 the
     velocity is i C 2j C 3k, and the curve is climbing.

       For the shadow on the xy plane, drop the k component. Position on the shadow is
     t i C t 2j. Velocity along the shadow is i C 2t j. The shadow is a plane curve.

     Fig. 12.1 Position vector R, change R,          Fig. 12.2 Equations of a line, with and
                   velocity d R=dt.                                without the parameter t.

     EXAMPLE 2 Uniform motion in a straight line: the velocity vector v is constant.
     The speed and direction don't change. The position vector moves with d R=dt D v:

     R.t / D R0 C t v .R0 fixed, v fixed, t varying/                                               (3)

     That is the equation of a line in vector form. Certainly d R=dt D v. The starting
     point R0 D x0i C y0j C z0k is given. The velocity v D v1i C v2j C v3k is also given.
     Separating the x, y and z components, equation (3) for a line is

     line with parameter W x D x0 C t v1; y D y0 C t v2; z D z0 C t v3: (4)

     The speed along the line is v D  v2     C  v2   C  v2   :  The  direction  of  the  line  is  the

                                        1         2       3
     unit vector v= v . We have three equations for x; y; z, and eliminating t leaves two
     equations. The parameter t equals .x ¡ x0/=v1 from equation (4). It also equals
     .y ¡ y0/=v2 and .z ¡ z0/=v3. So these ratios equal each other, and t is gone:
     line without parameter W x ¡ x0 D y ¡ y0 D z ¡ z0 : (5)
                                                v1              v2   v3

     An example is x D y=2 D z=3. In this case .x0; y0; z0/ D .0; 0; 0/--the line goes
     through the origin. Another point on the line is .x; y; z/ D .2; 4; 6/. Because t is

     gone, we cannot say when we reach that point and how fast we are going. The equa-
     tions x=4Dy=8Dz=12 give the same line. Without t we can't know the velocity v D
     d R=dt.

     EXAMPLE 3 Find an equation for the line through P D .0; 2; 1/ and Q D .1; 3; 3/.

     Solution We have choices! R0 can go to any point on the line. The velocity v can
     be any multiple of the vector from P to Q. The decision on R0 controls where we
     start, and v controls our speed.

       The vector from P to Q is i C j C 2k. Those numbers 1; 1; 2 come from subtracting
     0; 2; 1 from 1; 3; 3. We choose this vector i C j C 2k as a first v, and double it for a
12.1 The Position Vector                                                                      519

second v. We choose the vector R0 D P as a first start and R0 D Q as a second start.
Here are two different expressions for the same line--they are P C t v and Q C t .2v/:

   R.t/ D .2j C k/ C t.i C j C 2k/ R¦.t/ D .i C 3j C 3k/ C t.2i C 2j C 4k/:

The vector R.t / gives x D t; y D 2 C t; z D 1 C 2t . The vector R¦ is at a different
point on the same line at the same time: x¦ D 1 C 2t; y¦ D 3 C 2t; z¦ D 3 C 4t .

  If I pick t D 1 in R and t D 0 in R¦, the point is .1; 3; 3/. We arrive there at different

times. You are seeing how parameters work, to tell "where" and also "when." If t

goes from ¡ to C , all points on one line are also on the other line. The path is

the same, but the "twins" are going at different speeds.

Question 1 When do these twins meet ? When does R.t / D R¦.t / ?

Answer They meet at t D ¡1, when R D R¦ D ¡i C j ¡ k.

Question 2 What is an equation for the segment between P and Q (not beyond) ?
Answer In the equation for R.t /, let t go from 0 to 1 (not beyond):

x D t y D 2 C t z D 1 C 2t OE0 t 1 for segment:                            (6)

At t D 0 we start from P D .0; 2; 1/. At t D 1 we reach Q D .1; 3; 3/.

Question 3 What is an equation for the line without the parameter t ?

Answer Solve equations (6) for t or use .5/: x=1 D .y ¡ 2/=1 D .z ¡ 1/=2.

Question 4 Which point on the line is closest to the origin ?
Answer The derivative of x2 C y2 C z2 D t 2 C .2 C t /2 C .1 C 2t /2 is 8 C 8t . This

derivative is zero at t D ¡1. So the closest point is .¡1; 1; ¡1/.

Question 5 Where does the line meet the plane x C y C z D 11 ?
Answer Equation (6) gives x C y C z D 3 C 4t D 11. So t D 2. The meeting point
is x D t D 2; y D t C 2 D 4; z D 1 C 2t D 5.

Question 6 What line goes through .3; 1; 1/ perpendicular to the plane x¡y¡z D

1?

Answer The normal vector to the plane is N D i ¡ j ¡ k. That is v. The position

vector to .3; 1; 1/ is R0 D 3i C j C k. Then R D R0 C t v.

                               COMPARING LINES AND PLANES

A line has one parameter or two equations. We give the starting point and veloc-
ity: .x; y; z/ D .x0; y0; z0/ C t .v1; v2; v3/. That tells directly which points are on the
line. Or we eliminate t to find the two equations in .5/.

  A plane has one equation or two parameters! The equation is ax C by C cz D d .
That tells us indirectly which points are on the plane. (Instead of knowing x; y; z;
we know the equation they satisfy. Instead of directions v and w in the plane, we are
told the perpendicular direction N D .a; b; c/:/ With parameters, the line contains
R0 C t v and the plane contains R0 C t v C sw. A plane looks worse with parameters
(t and s), a line looks better.

  Questions 5 and 6 connected lines to planes. Here are two more. See Problems

41 ¡ 44:

Question 7 When is the line R0 C t v parallel to the plane ? When is it
perpendicular ?

Answer The test is v ¤ N D 0. The test is v ¢ N D 0.

     .1; 0; 0/ C t .2; 0; ¡1/. That vector v will be in the plane.

     Solution The vector v D 2i ¡ k goes along the line. The vector w D 2j C k goes

     from .1; 0; 0/ to .1; 2; 1/. Their cross product is

     The plane 2x ¡ 2y C 4z D 2 has this normal N and contains the point .1; 2; 1/.

                         SPEED, DIRECTION, DISTANCE, ACCELERATION

     We go back to the curve traced out by R.t /. The derivative v.t / D d R=dt is the
     velocity vector along that curve. The speed is the magnitude of v:

     speed D v D .dx=dt /2 C .dy=dt /2 C .dz=dt /2:                                  (7)

     The direction of the velocity vector is v= v . This is a unit vector, since v is divided
     by its length. The unit tangent vector v= v is denoted by T.

       The tangent vector is constant for lines. It changes direction for curves.

     EXAMPLE 5 (important) Find v and v and T for steady motion around a circle:

                              x D r cos !t; y D r sin !t; z D 0:

     Solution The position vector is R D r cos !t i C r sin !t j. The velocity is

         v D d R=dt D ¡!r sin !t i C !r cos !t j .tangent, not unit tangent/

     The speed is the radius r times the angular velocity !:

                  v D .¡!r sin !t/2 C .!r cos !t/2 D !r:

     The unit tangent vector is v divided by v :

          T D ¡ sin !t i C cos !t j .length 1 since sin2!t C cos2!t D 1/:

     Think next about the distance traveled. Distance along a curve is always denoted by
     s (called arc length). I don't know why we use s--certainly not as the initial for
     speed. In fact speed is distance divided by time. The ratio s=t gives average speed;
     ds=dt is instantaneous speed. We are back to Chapter 1 and Section 8:3, the relation
     of speed to distance:

     speed v D ds=dt distance s D .ds=dt / dt D v.t / dt:

     Notice that v and s and t are scalars. The direction vector is T:

     T D v D d R=dt D d R D unit tangent vector. (8)
           v ds=dt ds

     In Figure 12.3, the chord length (straight) is R . The arc length (curved) is s. As
     R and s approach zero, the ratio R=s approaches T D 1.

  Think finally about the acceleration vector a.t /. It is the rate of change of velocity
(not the rate of change of speed):

                            dv d2R d2x d2y d2z
                       a D dt D dt 2 D dt 2 i C dt 2 j C dt 2 k: (9)

Fig. 12.3 Steady motion around a circle. Half turn up a helix.

For steady motion along a line, as in x D t; y D 2 C t; z D 1 C 2t , there is no accel-
eration. The second derivatives are all zero. For steady motion around a circle, there
is acceleration. In driving a car, you accelerate with the gas pedal or the brake. You
also accelerate by turning the wheel. It is the velocity vector that changes, not the
speed.

EXAMPLE 6 Find the distance s.t / and acceleration a.t / for circular motion.

Solution The speed in Example 5 is ds=dt D !r. After integrating, the distance
is s D !rt . At time t we have gone through an angle of !t . The radius is r, so

the distance traveled agrees with !t times r. Note that the dimension of ! is 1=time.
(Angles are dimensionless.) At time t D 2=! we have gone once around the circle--
to s D 2 r not back to s D 0.

  The acceleration is a D d 2R=dt 2. Remember R D r cos !t i C r sin !t j:

a.t/ D ¡!2r cos !t i ¡ !2r sin !t j:                                           (10)

That direction is opposite to R. This is a special motion, with no action on the gas
pedal or the brake. All the acceleration is from turning. The magnitude is a D !2r,
with the correct dimension of distance=(time)2.

EXAMPLE 7 Find v and s and a around the helix R D cos t i C sin t j C t k.

Solution The velocity is v D ¡ sin t i C cos t j C k. The speed is

                 ds=dt D v D sin2t C cos2t C 1 D 2 (constant):

Then distance is s D 2 t . At time t D , a half turn is complete. The distance along
the shadow is  (a half circle). The distance along the helix is 2 , because of its

45¥ slope.

  The unit tangent vector is velocity=speed, and the acceleration is d v=dt :

        T D .¡ sin t i C cos t j C k/= 2 a D ¡ cos t i ¡ sin t j:
522                                         12 Motion Along a Curve

     EXAMPLE 8 Find v and s and a around the ellipse x D cos t; y D 2 sin t; z D 0.

     Solution Take derivatives: v D ¡ sin t i C 2 cos t j and v D sin2t C 4 cos2t .

     This is the speed ds=dt . For the distance s, something bad happens (or something
     normal). The speed is not simplified by sin2t C cos2t D 1. We cannot integrate ds=dt
     to find a formula for s. The square root defeats us.

      The acceleration ¡ cos t i ¡ 2 sin t j still points to the center. This is not the Earth

     going around the sun. The path is an ellipse but the speed is wrong. See Section 12:4
     (the pound note) for a terrible error in the position of the sun.

     12A The basic formulas for motion along a curve are

                     vD dR aD dv                         v D ds T D v D d R=dt D d R :

       Suppose we know the acceleration a.t / and the initial velocity v0 and position R0.
     Then v.t / and R.t / are also known. We integrate each component:

                                            THE CURVE OF A BASEBALL

     There is a nice discussion of curve balls in the calculus book by Edwards and Penney.

     We summarize it here (optionally). The ball leaves the pitcher's hand five feet off the

     ground: R0 D 0i C 0j C 5k. The initial velocity is v0 D 120i ¡ 2j C 2k (120 ft=sec
     is more than 80 miles per hour). The acceleration is ¡32k from gravity, plus a new

     term from spin. If the spin is around the z axis, and the ball goes along the x axis,

     then this acceleration is in the y direction. (It comes from the cross product k ¢ i--

     there is a pressure difference on the sides of the ball.) A good pitcher can achieve

     a D 16j ¡ 32k. The batter integrates as fast as he can:

            v.t/ D v0 C at D 120i C .¡2 C 16t/j C .2 ¡ 32t/k

            R.t  /  D    R0   C  v0  t  C   1  at  2  D  120  t  i  C  .¡2  t  C  8  t  2  /j  C  .5  C  2  t  ¡  16     t  2  /k:
                                            2

     Notice the t 2. The effect of spin is small at first, then suddenly bigger (as every batter
                                                                                                           1
     knows).  So     is  the  effect    of  gravity--the         ball  starts  to   dive.      At  t  D    2   ,  the  i  component

     is 60 feet and the ball reaches the batter. The j component is 1 foot and the k

     component is 2 feet--the curve goes low over the outside corner.

     At  t  D  1  ,  when     the  batter      saw    the  ball  halfway,      the  j   component          was       zero.     It  looked
               4
     as if it was coming right over the plate.

       12.2 Plane Motion: Projectiles and Cycloids

The previous section started with R.t /: From this position vector we computed v and
a: Now we find R.t / itself, from more basic information. The laws of physics govern
projectiles, and the motion of a wheel produces a cycloid (which enters problems in
robotics). The projectiles fly without friction, so the only force is gravity.

  These motions occur in a plane. The two components of position will be x (across)
and y (up). A projectile moves as t changes, so we look for x.t / and y.t /: We are
shooting a basketball or firing a gun or peacefully watering the lawn, and we have
to aim in the right direction (not directly at the target). If the hose delivers water at
10 meters=second; can you reach the car 12 meters away ?

  The usual initial position is .0; 0/: Some flights start higher, at .0; h/: The initial
velocity is .v0 cos ; v0 sin /; where v0 is the speed and  is the angle with the

horizontal. The acceleration from gravity is purely vertical: d 2y=dt 2 D ¡g: So the
horizontal velocity stays at its initial value. The upward velocity decreases by ¡gt :

              dx=dt D v0 cos ; dy=dt D v0 sin  ¡ gt:

The horizontal distance x.t / is steadily increasing. The height y.t / increases and
then decreases. To find the position, integrate the velocities (for a high start add h to
y):

    The projectile path is x.t / D .v0 cos /t; y.t / D .v0 sin /t ¡ 12 gt 2: (1)

This path is a parabola. But it is not written as y D ax2 C bx C c: It could be, if we
eliminated t: Then we would lose track of time. The parabola is y.x/, with no
parameter, where we have x.t / and y.t /:

  Basic question: Where does the projectile hit the ground ? For the parabola, we
solve y.x/ D 0: That gives the position x: For the projectile we solve y.t / D 0:
That gives the time it hits the ground, not the place. If that time is T; then x.T / gives
the place.

  The information is there. It takes two steps instead of one, but we learn more.

EXAMPLE 1 Water leaves the hose at 10 meters=second (this is v0). It starts up
at the angle : Find the time T when y is zero again, and find where the projectile
lands.

Solution The flight ends when y D .10 sin /T ¡ 12 gT 2 D 0: The flight time is

T D .20 sin /=g: At that time, the horizontal distance is

          x.T / D .10 cos /T D .200 cos  sin /=g: This is the range R:

The projectile (or water from the hose) hits the ground at x D R: To simplify, replace
200 cos  sin  by 100 sin 2: Since g D 9:8 meters=sec2; we can't reach the car:

      The range R D .100 sin 2/=9:8 is at most 100=9:8: This is less than 12:

The range is greatest when sin 2 D 1. is 45¥). To reach 12 meters we could stand

on a ladder (Problem 14). To hit a baseball against air resistance, the best angle is

nearer to 35¥: Figure 12.5 shows symmetric parabolas (no air resistance) and unsym-

metric flight paths that drop more steeply.

  12B The flight time T and the horizontal range R D x.T / are reached when
  y D 0, which means .v0 sin /T D 12 gT 2:

              T D .2v0 sin /=g and R D .v0 cos /T D .v02 sin 2/=g:

     Fig. 12.5  Equal range R; different times T: Baseballs hit at 35¼ with increasing v0: The dots are

                at half-seconds (from The Physics of Baseball by Robert Adair: Harper and Row 1990).

     EXAMPLE 2 What are the correct angles  for a given range R and given v0 ?

     Solution The range is R D .v02 sin 2/=g: This determines the sine of 2--but

     two angles can have the same sine. We might find 2 D 60¥ or 120¥: The starting
     angles  D 30¥ and  D 60¥ in Figure 12.5 give the same sin 2 and the same range

     R: The flight times contain sin  and are different.

         By calculus, the maximum height occurs when dy=dt D 0: Then v0 sin  D gt ,

     which means that t D .v0 sin /=g: This is half of the total flight time T --the time
     going up equals the time coming down. The value of y at this halfway time t D 21 T

     EXAMPLE 3 If a ski jumper goes 90 meters down a 30¥ slope, after taking off at

     28 meters=second; find equations for the flight time and the ramp angle :

     Solution The jumper lands at the point x D 90 cos 30¥; y D ¡90 sin 30¥ (minus
     sign for obvious reasons). The basic equation (2) is x D .28 cos /t; y D .28 sin /t ¡

     12 gt 2: Those are two equations for  and t: Note that t is not T , the flight time to
     y D 0:

     Conclusion The position of a projectile involves three parameters v0; , and t: Three

     pieces of information determine the flight (almost). The reason for the word almost

     is the presence of sin  and cos : Some flight requirements cannot be met (reach-

     ing a car at 12 meters). Other requirements can be met in two ways (when the car

     is close). The equation sin  D c is more likely to have no solution or two solutions

     than exactly one solution.

         Watch for the three pieces of information in each problem. When a football starts at

     v0 D 20 meters=second and hits the ground at x D 40 meters, the third fact is       :

     This is like a lawyer who is asked the fee and says $1000 for three questions. "Isn't

     that steep ? " says the client. "Yes," says the lawyer, "now what's your last question ? "

                                                     CYCLOIDS

     A projectile's path is a parabola. To compute it, eliminate t from the equations for x
     and y: Problem 5 finds y D ax2 C bx, a parabola through the origin. The path of a
     point on a wheel seems equally simple, but eliminating t is virtually impossible. The
     cycloid is a curve that really needs and uses a parameter.

       To trace out a cycloid, roll a circle of radius a along the x axis. Watch the point
     that starts at the bottom of the circle. It comes back to the bottom at x D 2a, after

a complete turn of the circle. The path in between is shown in Figure 12.6. After a
century of looking for the xy equation, a series of great scientists (Galileo, Christopher
Wren, Huygens, Bernoulli, even Newton and l'Hôpital) found the right way to study
a cycloid--by introducing a parameter. We will call it  ; it could also be t:

        Fig. 12.6 Path of P on a rolling circle is a cycloid. Fastest slide to Q:

The parameter is the angle  through which the circle turns. (This angle is not at

the origin, like  in polar coordinates.) The circle rolls a distance a , radius times

angle, along the x axis. So the center of the circle is at x D a; y D a: To account for

the segment CP , subtract a sin  from x and a cos  from y:

        The point P has x D a. ¡ sin  / and y D a.1 ¡ cos  /:                      (3)

At  D 0 the position is .0; 0/: At  D 2 the position is .2a; 0/: In between, the
slope of the cycloid comes from the chain rule:

                              dy D dy=d D a sin  : (4)

                  dx dx=d a.1 ¡ cos /

This is infinite at  D 0: The point on the circle starts straight upward and the cycloid
has a cusp. Note how all calculations use the parameter : We go quickly:

Question 1 Find the area under one arch of the cycloid . D 0 to  D 2/:

Answer The area is y dx D 02 a.1 ¡ cos  /a.1 ¡ cos  /d: This equals 3a2:

Question 2 Find the length of the arch, using ds D .dx=d /2 ¡ .dy=d /2 d:
        ds D 02 a  .1 ¡ cos  /2 ¡ .sin  /2 d D  2           2 ¡ 2 cos  d:
Answer
                                                0a
Now substitute 1 ¡ cos  D 2 sin2 12 : The square root is 2 sin 12 : The length is 8a:

Question 3 If the cycloid is turned over (y is downward), find the time to slide to
the bottom. The slider starts with v D 0 at y D 0:

Answer Kinetic plus potential energy is 12 mv2 ¡ mgy D 0 (it starts from zero and

can't change). So the speed is v D 2gy: This is ds=dt and we know ds:

    ÷ ÷ sliding time D dt D ds ÷  D a 2 ¡ 2 cos  d D  a=g:
                        2gy 0 2ga.1 ¡ cos  /

Check dimensions: a D distance; g D distance=.times/2;  a=g D time: That is
the shortest sliding time for any curve. The cycloid solves the "brachistochrone
problem," which minimizes the time down curves from O to Q (Figure 12.6). You
might think a straight path would be quicker--it is certainly shorter. A straight line
has the equation x D y=2, so the sliding time is

                                      2a  .=2/2 C 1 dy= 2gy D 2 C 4 a=g:           (5)

dt D ds= 2gy D 0

This is larger than the cycloid time  a=g: It is better to start out vertically and pick
up speed early, even if the path is longer.
528                                         12 Motion along a Curve

              Instead of publishing his solution, John Bernoulli turned this problem into an
            international challenge: Prove that the cycloid gives the fastest slide. Most
            mathematicians couldn't do it. The problem reached Isaac Newton (this was later
            in his life). As you would expect, Newton solved it. For some reason he sent back his
            proof with no name. But when Bernoulli received the answer, he was not fooled for a
            moment: "I recognize the lion by his claws."

              What is also amazing is a further property of the cycloid: The time to Q is the
            same if you begin anywhere along the path. Starting from rest at P instead of O,
            the bottom is reached at the same time. This time Bernoulli got carried away: "You
            will be petrified with astonishment when I say...".

              There are other beautiful curves, closely related to the cycloid. For an epicycloid,
            the circle rolls around the outside of another circle. For a hypocycloid, the rolling
            circle is inside the fixed circle. The astroid is the special case with radii in the ratio 1
            to 4: It is the curved star in Problem 34, where x D a cos3  and y D a sin3 :

              The cycloid even solves the old puzzle: What point moves backward when a train
            starts forward ? The train wheels have a flange that extends below the track, and
            dx=dt 0 at the bottom of the flange.

12.3 Curvature and Normal Vector

A driver produces acceleration three ways--by the gas pedal, the brake, and steering
wheel. The first two change the speed. Turning the wheel changes the direction. All
three change the velocity (they give acceleration). For steady motion around a circle,
the change is from steering--the acceleration d v=dt points to the center. We now
look at motion along other curves, to separate change in the speed v from change in
the direction T:

  The direction of motion is T D v= v : It depends on the path but not the speed
(because we divide by v ). For turning we measure two things:

      1. How fast T turns: this will be the curvature  (kappa).
      2. Which direction T turns: this will be the normal vector N.

 and N depend, like s and T, only on the shape of the curve. Replacing t by 2t or
t 2 leaves them unchanged. For a circle we give the answers in advance. The normal
vector N points to the center. The curvature  is 1=radius.

  A smaller turning circle means a larger curvature : more bending.

  The curvature  is change in direction d T divided by change in position ds :
There are three formulas for --a direct one for graphs y.x/, a brutal but valuable
one for any parametric curve .x.t /; y.t //; and a neat formula that uses the vectors v
and a: We begin with the definition and the neat formula.

      DEFINITION  D d T=ds FORMULA  D v ¢ a = v 3 (1)

The definition does not involve the parameter t --but the calculations do. The
position vector R.t / yields v D d R=dt and a D d v=dt: If t is changed to 2t , the

velocity v is doubled and a is multiplied by 4: Then v ¢ a and v 3 are multiplied

by 8, and their ratio  is unchanged.

Proof of formula (1) Start from v D v T and compute its derivative a:

            a D d v T C v d T by the product rule:
                dt      dt

Now take the cross product with v D v T: Remember that T ¢ T D 0:

                    v ¢ a D v T ¢ v d T: (2)

                                          dt

We know that T D 1: Equation (4) will show that T is perpendicular to d T=dt: So

v ¢ a is the first length v times the second length v d T=dt : The factor sin  in

the length of a cross product is 1 from the 90¥ angle. In other words

§§§ d T §§§ D v ¢ a §§ and  D § d T § § § § § D § d T=dt §§§ D v ¢ a : (3)
§ dt §      v2              § ds § § ds=dt § v 3

The chain rule brings the extra ds=dt D v into the denominator.

  Before any examples, we show that d T=dt is perpendicular to T: The reason is

that T is a unit vector. Differentiate both sides of T ¤ T D 1:

        d T ¤ T C T ¤ d T D 0 or 2T ¤ d T D 0: (4)
        dt          dt      dt

That proof used the product rule U½ ¤ V C U ¤ V½ for the derivative of U ¤ V

(Problem 23, with U D V D T). Think of the vector T moving around the unit sphere.
532                             12 Motion along a Curve

     To keep a constant length .T C d T/ ¤ .T C d T/ D 1, we need 2T ¤ d T D 0: Move-

     ment d T is perpendicular to radius vector T:

       Our first examples will be plane curves. The position vector R.t / has components

     x.t / and y.t / but no z.t /: Look at the components of v and a and v ¢ a (x½ means

     dx=d t ):

     R x.t/ y.t/                     0

     v x½.t/ y½.t/                   0               v D x½ 2 C y½ 2

     v¢a 0                0 x½y¾ ¡y½y¾

     Equation (5) is the brutal but valuable formula for : Apply it to movement around a

     circle. We should find  D 1=radius a:

     EXAMPLE 1 When x D a cos !t and y D a sin !t we substitute x½; y½; x¾; y¾ into (5):

          .¡!a sin !t/.¡!2a sin !t/ ¡ .!a cos !t/.¡!2a cos !t/ !2a2
     D                                                                            D OE!2a23=2 :
                       OE.! a sin !t /2 C .! a cos !t /23=2

     This is !3a2=!3a3 and ! cancels. The speed makes no difference to  D 1=a:

       The third formula for  applies to an ordinary plane curve given by y.x/: The
     parameter t is x! You see the square root in the speed v D ds=dx:

     R x y.x/                        0

     v 1 dy=dx                       0               v D 1 C .dy=dx/2

     v ¢ a 0 0 d 2y=dx2  D .1 C .dy=dx/2/3=2 (6)

     In practice this is the most popular formula for : The most popular approximation is
     d 2y=dx2 : (The denominator is omitted.) For the bending of a beam, the nonlinear
     equation uses  and the linear equation uses d 2y=dx2:We can see the difference for

     go a long way for a small change in direction.

                                                    0§

This cross product has length 2: Also the speed is v D sin 2 t C cos 2 t C 1 D

2W

                D v ¢ a = v 3 D 2=. 2/3 D 12 :

Compare with a unit circle. Without the climbing term t k, the curvature would be 1:
                                                                          1
Because  of  climbing,  each  turn  of  the  helix  is  longer  and    D  2  :

That makes one think: Is the helix twice as long as the circle ? No. The length of

a turn is only increased by v D 2: The other 2 is because the tangent T slopes

upward. The shadow in the base turns a full 360¥, but T turns less.

                              THE NORMAL VECTOR N

The discussion is bringing us to an important vector. Where  measures the rate of
turning, the unit vector N gives the direction of turning. N is perpendicular to T, and
in the plane that leaves practically no choice. Turn left or right. For a space curve,
follow d T: Remember equation (4), which makes d T perpendicular to T:

  The normal vector N is a unit vector along d T=dt: It is perpendicular to T:

DEFINITION N D d T=ds D 1 d T                           FORMULA N D d T=dt : (7)
                         d T=ds  ds                                            d T=dt

EXAMPLE 4 Find the normal vector N for the same helix R D cos t i C sin t j C
t k:

Solution Copy v from Example 3, divide by v , and compute d T=dt :

T D v= v D .¡ sin t i C cos t j C k/= 2 and d T=dt D .¡ cos t i ¡ sin t j/= 2:

To change d T=dt into a unit vector, cancel the 2: The normal vector is N D

¡ cos t i ¡ sin t j: It is perpendicular to T: Since the k component is zero, N is

horizontal. The tangent T slopes up at 45¥--it goes around the circle at that

latitude. The normal N is tangent to this circle (N is tangent to the path of the
tangent!). So N stays horizontal as the helix climbs.

  There is also a third direction, perpendicular to T and N: It is the binormal vector

B D T ¢ N, computed in Problems 25 ¡ 30: The unit vectors T; N; B provide the nat-

ural coordinate system for the path--along the curve, in the plane of the curve, and
out of that plane. The theory is beautiful but the computations are not often done--we
stop here.

         TANGENTIAL AND NORMAL COMPONENTS OF ACCELERATION

May I return a last time to the gas pedal and brake and steering wheel ? The first
two give acceleration along T: Turning gives acceleration along N: The rate of turn-
ing (curvature ) and the direction N are established. We now ask about the force
534                         12 Motion along a Curve

     required. Newton's Law is F D ma, so we need the acceleration a--especially its
     component along T and its component along N:

                                                         d 2s  ds 2
                          The acceleration is a D dt2 T C  dt N: (8)

      For a straight path, d 2s=dt 2 is the only acceleration--the ordinary second
     derivative. The term .ds=dt /2 is the acceleration in turning. Both have the
     dimension of length=(time)2:

       The force to steer around a corner depends on curvature and speed--as all drivers
     know. Acceleration is the derivative of v D v T D .ds=dt /T:

                                 d2s ds dT d2s ds dT ds
                           a D dt 2 T C dt dt D dt 2 T C dt ds dt : (9)

     That last term is .ds=dt /2N, since d T=ds D N by formula (7). So (8) is proved.

     EXAMPLE 5 A fixed speed ds=dt D 1 gives d 2s=dt 2 D 0: The only acceleration is N:

     EXAMPLE 6 Find the components of a for circular speed-up R.t / D cos t 2 i C sin t 2 j:

     Without stopping to think, compute d R=dt D v and ds=dt D v and v= v D T:

           v D ¡2t sin t2 i C 2t cos t2 j; v D 2t; T D ¡ sin t2 i C cos t2 j:

     The derivative of ds=dt D v is d 2s=dt 2 D 2: The derivative of v is a:

              a D ¡2 sin t2 i C 2 cos t2 j ¡ 4t2 cos t2 i ¡ 4t2 sin t2 j:

     In the first terms of a we see 2T: In the last terms we must be seeing  v 2N:
     Certainly v 2 D 4t 2 and  D 1, because the circle has radius 1: Thus a D 2T C 4t 2N
     has the tangential component 2 and normal component 4t 2--acceleration along the
     circle and in to the center.

12.4 Polar Coordinates and Planetary Motion

This section has a general purpose--to do vector calculus in polar coordinates. It
also has a specific purpose--to study central forces and the motion of planets. The
main gravitational force on a planet is from the sun. It is a central force, because it
comes from the sun at the center. Polar coordinates are natural, so the two purposes
go together.

  You may feel that the planets are too old for this course. But Kepler's laws are more
than theorems, they are something special in the history of mankind--"the greatest
scientific discovery of all time." If we can recapture that glory we should do it. Part
of the greatness is in the difficulty--Kepler was working sixty years before Newton
discovered calculus. From pages of observations, and some terrific guesses, a theory
was born. We will try to preserve the greatness without the difficulty, and show how
elliptic orbits come from calculus. The first conclusion is quick.

        Motion in a central force field always stays in a plane.

F is a multiple of the vector R from the origin (central force). F also equals ma

(Newton's Law). Therefore R and a are in the same direction and R ¢ a D 0: Then
R ¢ v has zero derivative and is constant:

         by the product rule W d .R ¢ v/ D v ¢ v C R ¢ a D 0 C 0: (1)

                                        dt

R ¢ v is a constant vector H: So R stays in the plane perpendicular to H:

  How does a planet move in that plane ? We turn to polar coordinates. At each point
except the origin (where the sun is), ur is the unit vector pointing outward. It is the
position vector R divided by its length r (which is x2 C y2):

             ur D R=r D .xi C yj/=r D cos  i C sin  j:                     (2)

That is a unit vector because cos2  C sin2  D 1: It goes out from the center.

Figure 12.9 shows ur and the second unit vector u at a 90¥ angle:

             u D ¡ sin  i C cos  j:                                        (3)

The dot product is ur ¤ u D 0: The subscripts r and  indicate direction (not derivative).

Question 1: How do ur and u change as r changes (out a ray) ? They don't.

Question 2:  How do ur and u change as  changes ? Take the derivative:

               d ur =d D ¡ sin  i C cos  j D u (4)
               d u =d D ¡ cos  i C sin  j D ¡ur:

Fig. 12.9 ur is outward, u is around the center. Components of v and a in this directions.
538                   12 Motion along a Curve

     Since ur D R=r, one formula is simple: The position vector is R D rur : For its
     derivative v D d R=dt , use the chain rule d ur =dt D .d ur =d /.d=dt / D .d=dt /u:

                              d       dr       d
               The velocity is v D .rur / D ur C r u :                         (5)
                              dt      dt       dt

     The outward speed is dr=dt: The circular speed is r d=dt: The sum of squares is v 2:
       Return one more time to steady motion around a circle, say r D 3 and  D 2t: The

     velocity is v D 6u , all circular. The acceleration is ¡12ur , all inward. For circles u

     is the tangent vector T: But the unit vector ur points outward and N points inward--
     the way the curve turns.

       Now we tackle acceleration for any motion in polar coordinates. There can be
     speedup in r and speedup in  (also change of direction). Differentiate v in (5) by the

     product rule:

               d v d 2r dr d ur dr d      d2         d d u
               D 2 ur C   C           u C r 2 u C r         :
               dt dt     dt dt dt dt      dt         dt dt

     For d ur =dt and d u =dt , multiply equation (4) by d=dt: Then all terms contain
     ur or u : The formula for a is famous but not popular (except it got us to the moon):

               d v  d 2r  d 2  d 2 dr d 
               aD D 2 ¡r          ur C r 2 C 2          u :                    (6)
               dt dt      dt          dt        dt dt

     In the steady motion with r D 3 and  D 2t , only one acceleration term is nonzero:

     a D ¡12ur: Formula (6) can be memorized (maybe). Problem 14 gives a new way to

     reach it, using rei :

     EXAMPLE 1 Find R and v and a for speedup  D t 2 around the circle r D 1:

     Solution  The position vector is R D ur: Then v and a come from .5 ¡ 6/:
                 v D .r d=dt /u D 2t u a D ¡.2t /2ur C 2u :

     This question and answer were also in Example 6 of the previous section. The

     acceleration was 2T C 4t 2N: Notice again that T D u and N D ¡ur , going round

     the circle.

     EXAMPLE 2 Find R and v and v and a for the spiral motion r D 3t;  D 2t:

     Solution The position vector is R D 3t ur : Equation (5) gives velocity and speed:

                         v D 3ur C D 6t u and v D .3/2 C .6t /2:

     The motion goes out and also around. From (6) the acceleration is ¡12t ur C 12u :

     The same answers would come more slowly from R D 3t cos 2t i C 3t sin 2t j:
       This example uses polar coordinates, but the motion is not circular. One of

     Kepler's inspirations, after many struggles, was to get away from circles.

                                                KEPLER'S LAWS

     You may know that before Newton and Leibniz and calculus and polar coordinates,
     Johannes Kepler discovered three laws of planetary motion. He was the court
     mathematician to the Holy Roman Emperor, who mostly wanted predictions of wars.
     Kepler also determined the date of every Easter--no small problem. His triumph was
     to discover patterns in the observations made by astronomers (especially by Tycho
     Brahe). Galileo and Copernicus expected circles, but Kepler found ellipses.
                   12.4 Polar Coordinates and Planetary Motion                                                539

Law 1: Each planet travels in an ellipse with one focus at the sun.

Law 2: The vector from sun to planet sweeps out area at a steady rate: dA=dt D
constant.

Law 3: The length of the planet's year is T D ka3=2, where a = maximum distance
from the center (not the sun) and k D 2= GM is the same for all planets.

With calculus the proof of these laws is a thousand times quicker. But Law 2 is the

only easy one. The sun exerts a central force. Equation (1) gave R ¢ v D H D con-

stant for central forces. Replace R by rur and replace v by equation (5):

                                      dr             d                2 d
                       H D rur ¢ dt ur C r dt u D r dt .ur ¢ u /: (7)

This vector H is constant, so its length h D r2d=dt is constant. In polar coordi-
                              1
nates,  the  area  is  dA  D  2  r  2d:  This  area  dA  is  swept    out  by  the  planet  (Figure  12.10),

and we have proved Law 2:

                           dA=d t   D    1  r  2 d =d t  D   1  h  D  constant:                      (8)
                                         2                   2

Near the sun r is small. So d=dt is big and planets go around faster.

        Fig. 12.10 The planet is on an ellipse with the sun at a focus. Note a, b, c, q.

 Now for Law 1, about ellipses. We are aiming for 1=r D C ¡ D cos  , which is

the polar coordinate equation of an ellipse. It is easier to write q than 1=r, and
find an equation for q: The equation we will reach is d 2q=d 2 C q D C: The desired

q D C ¡ D cos  solves that equation (check this), and gives us Kepler's ellipse.

  The first step is to connect dr=dt to dq=d by the chain rule:

                       dr d  1  ¡1 dq ¡1 dq d dq
                           D             D2 D2                             D ¡h :                    (9)
                       dt dt q q dt q d dt                                             d

Notice especially d=dt D h=r2 D hq2: What we really want are second derivatives:

             d2r d dq  d dq  d 2 2 d2q
                       D ¡h                 D ¡h                           D ¡h q 2 :                (10)
             dt2              dt d                   d d dt                               d

After this trick of introducing q, we are ready for physics. The planet obeys Newton's
Law F D ma, and the central force F is the sun's gravity:

                           F GM d 2r  d 2
                              D a is ¡ 2 D 2 ¡ r                                    :                (11)
                           m                   r dt                        dt
540                   12 Motion along a Curve

     That right side is the ur component of a in (6). Change r to 1=q and change d=dt
     to hq2: The preparation in(10) allows us to rewrite d 2r=dt 2 in equation (11). That
     equation becomes

                     ¡GM q2 D ¡h2q d 2 2 d 2q ¡ 1q .hq2/2:

     Dividing by ¡h2q2 gives what we hoped for--the simple equation for q:

     d 2q=d 2 C q D GM= h2 D C .a constant/:                                         (12)

     The solution is q D C ¡ D cos : Section 9:3 gave this polar equation for an ellipse

     or parabola or hyperbola. To be sure it is an ellipse, an astronomer computes C and D

     from the sun's mass M and the constant G and the earth's position and velocity. The

     main point is that C D: Then q is never zero and r is never infinite. Hyperbolas

     and parabolas are ruled out, and the orbit in Figure 12.10 must be an ellipse.

       Astronomy is really impressive. You should visit the Greenwich Observatory in
     London, to see how Halley watched his comet. He amazed the world by predicting
     the day it would return. Also the discovery of Neptune was pure mathematics--the
     path of Uranus was not accounted for by the sun and known planets. LeVerrier
     computed a point in the sky and asked a Berlin astronomer to look. Sure enough
     Neptune was there.

       Recently one more problem was solved--to explain the gap in the asteroids around
     Jupiter. The reason is "chaos"--the three-body problem goes unstable and an asteroid
     won't stay in that orbit. We have come a long way from circles.

       Department of Royal Mistakes The last pound note issued by the Royal Mint
     showed Newton looking up from his great book Principia Mathematica. He is not
     smiling and we can see why. The artist put the sun at the center! Newton has just
     proved it is at the focus. True, the focus is marked S and the planet is P: But those
     rays at the center brought untold headaches to the Mint--the note is out of circulation.
     I gave an antique dealer three pounds for it (in coins).

       Kepler's third law gives the time T to go around the ellipse--the planet's year.
     What is special in the formula is a3=2--and for Kepler himself, the 15th of May

     1618 was unforgettable: "the right ratio outfought the darkness of my mind, by the

     great proof afforded by my labor of seventeen years on Brahe's observations." The
     second law dA=dt D 21 h is the key, plus two facts about an ellipse--its area ab
     and the height b2=a above the sun:

     1. The area A D  ÷ T dA 1                                                 2 ab
                            dt D hT must equal ab, so T D
                      0 dt  2                                                  h

     2. The distance r D 1=C at  D =2 must equal b2=a, so b D a=C :

     The height b2=a is in Figure 12.10 and Problems 25 ¡ 26: The constant C D GM= h2

     is in equation (12). Put them together to find the period:

     T D 2ab D 2a a D 2 a3=2: (13)
                      h     h C GM

      An amateur sees the planet come around again, and votes for an ellipse.

To think of Kepler guessing a3=2 is amazing. To think of Newton proving Kepler's
laws by calculus is also wonderful--because we can do it too.

EXAMPLE 3 When a satellite goes around in a circle, find the time T:

Let r be the radius and ! be the angular velocity. The time for a complete circle (angle
2) is T D 2=!: The acceleration is GM=r2 from gravity, and it is also r!2 for
circular motion. Therefore Kepler is proved right:

r!2 D GM=r2                                  ! D GM=r3              T D 2=! D 2 r3=2= GM :

                   Partial Derivatives

     This chapter is at the center of multidimensional calculus. Other chapters and other
     topics may be optional; this chapter and these topics are required. We are back to the
     basic idea of calculus--the derivative. There is a function f; the variables move a
     little bit, and f moves. The question is how much f moves and how fast. Chapters
     1-4 answered this question for f .x/; a function of one variable. Now we have f .x; y/
     or f .x; y; z/--with two or three or more variables that move independently. As x
     and y change, f changes. The fundamental problem of differential calculus is to
     connect x and y to f: Calculus solves that problem in the limit. It connects dx
     and dy to df: In using this language I am building on the work already done. You
     know that df =dx is the limit of f =x: Calculus computes the rate of change--
     which is the slope of the tangent line. The goal is to extend those ideas to

     f .x; y/ D x2 ¡ y2 or f .x; y/ D x2 C y2 or f .x; y; z/ D 2x C 3y C 4z:

     These functions have graphs, they have derivatives, and they must have tangents.
       The heart of this chapter is summarized in six lines. The subject is differential

     calculus--small changes in a short time. Still to come is integral calculus--adding
     up those small changes. We give the words and symbols for f .x; y/; matched with
     the words and symbols for f .x/: Please use this summary as a guide, to know where
     calculus is going.

                13.1 Surfaces and Level Curves

The graph of y D f .x/ is a curve in the xy plane. There are two variables--x
is independent and free, y is dependent on x: Above x on the base line is the point
.x; y/ on the curve. The curve can be displayed on a two-dimensional printed page.
The graph of z D f .x; y/ is a surface in xyz space. There are three variables--
x and y are independent, z is dependent. Above .x; y/ in the base plane is the point
.x; y; z/ on the surface (Figure 13.1). Since the printed page remains two-dimensional,
we shade or color or project the surface. The eyes are extremely good at converting
two-dimensional images into three-dimensional understanding--they get a lot of
practice. The mathematical part of our brain also has something new to work on--two
partial derivatives.

  This section uses examples and figures to illustrate surfaces and their level curves.
The next section is also short. Then the work begins.

EXAMPLE 1 Describe the surface and the level curves for z Df .x; y/D x2 C y2:

The surface is a cone. Reason: x2 C y2 is the distance in the base plane from
.0; 0/ to .x; y/: When we go out a distance 5 in the base plane, we go up the same
distance 5 to the surface. The cone climbs with slope 1: The distance out to .x; y/

equals the distance up to z (this is a 45¥ cone).

  The level curves are circles. At height 5; the cone contains a circle of points--all
at the same "level" on the surface. The plane z D 5 meets the surface z D x2 C y2
at those points (Figure 13.1b). The circle below them (in the base plane) is the level
curve.

DEFINITION A level curve or contour line of z D f .x; y/ contains all points .x; y/
that share the same value f .x; y/ D c. Above those points, the surface is at the
height z D c:

  There are different level curves for different c: To see the curve for c D 2; cut
through the surface with the horizontal plane z D 2: The plane meets the surface
above the points where f .x; y/ D 2: The level curve in the base plane has the
equation f .x; y/ D 2: Above it are all the points at "level 2" or "level c" on the
surface.

  Every curve f .x; y/ D c is labeled by its constant c: This produces a contour
map (the base plane is full of curves). For the cone, the level curves are given by

   x2 C y2 D c; and the contour map consists of circles of radius c:

Question What are the level curves of z D f .x; y/ D x2 C y2?
Answer Still circles. But the surface is not a cone (it bends up like a parabola). The
circle of radius 3 is the level curve x2 C y2 D 9: On the surface above, the height is
9:

EXAMPLE 2 For the linear function f .x; y/ D 2x C y; the surface is a plane. Its
level curves are straight lines. The surface z D 2x C y meets the plane z D c in
the line 2x C y D c. That line is above the base plane when c is positive, and below
when c is negative. The contour lines are in the base plane. Figure 13.2b labels these
parallel lines according to their height in the surface.

Question If the level curves are all straight lines, must they be parallel?
Answer No. The surface z D y=x has level curves y=x D c: Those lines y D cx
swing around the origin, as the surface climbs like a spiral playground slide.

     Fig. 13.1 The surface for z D f .x; y/ D x2 C y2 is a cone. The level curves are circles.

     Fig. 13.2 A plane has parallel level lines. The spiral slide z D y=x has lines y=x D c:

     EXAMPLE 3 The weather map shows contour lines of the temperature function.
     Each level curve connects points at a constant temperature. One line runs from Seattle
     to Omaha to Cincinnati to Washington. In winter it is painful even to think about the
     line through L.A. and Texas and Florida. USA Today separates the contours by color,
     which is better. We had never seen a map of universities.
     Question From a contour map, how do you find the highest point?
     Answer The level curves form loops around the maximum point. As c increases the
     loops become tighter. Similarly the curves squeeze to the lowest point as c decreases.

     EXAMPLE 4 A contour map of a mountain may be the best example of all.
     Normally the level curves are separated by 100 feet in height. On a steep trail those
     curves are bunched together--the trail climbs quickly. In a flat region the contour
     lines are far apart. Water runs perpendicular to the level curves. On my map of New
     Hampshire that is true of creeks but looks doubtful for rivers.

     Question Which direction in the base plane is uphill on the surface?
     Answer The steepest direction is perpendicular to the level curves. This is impor-
     tant. Proof to come.

     EXAMPLE 5 In economics x2y is a utility function and x2y D c is an indifference
     curve.

     The utility function x2y gives the value of x hours awake and y hours asleep. Two
                                                                            1

         We are indifferent, and willing to exchange any two points on a level curve.

            The indifference curve is "convex." We prefer the average of any two points. The
         line between two points is up on higher level curves.

            Figure 13.4b shows an extreme case. The level curves are straight lines 4x C y D c:
         Four quarters are freely substituted for one dollar. The value is f D 4x C y dollars.

            Figure 13.4c shows the other extreme. Extra left shoes or extra right shoes are
         useless. The value (or utility) is the smaller of x and y: That counts pairs of shoes.

                      13.2 Partial Derivatives

The central idea of differential calculus is the derivative. A change in x produces a

change in f . The ratio f =x approaches the derivative, or slope, or rate of change.

What to do if f depends on both x and y?

The new idea is to vary x and y one at a time. First, only x moves. If the function

is x C xy, then f is x C yx. The ratio f =x is 1 C y. The "x derivative" of

x C xy is 1 C y. For all functions the method is the same: Keep y constant, change

x, take the limit of f =x:

DEFINITION     f .x; y/ D lim f D lim f .x C x; y/ ¡ f .x; y/: (1)
               x                   x 0 x x 0                              x

On the left is a new symbol f = x. It signals that only x is allowed to vary-- f = x
is a partial derivative. The different form of the same letter (still say "d ") is a
reminder that x is not the only variable. Another variable y is present but not moving.

EXAMPLE 1 f .x; y/ D x2y2 C xy C y                         f .x; y/ D 2xy2 C y C 0.
                                                           x

Do not treat y as zero! Treat it as a constant, like 6. Its x derivative is zero.

If f .x/ D sin 6x then df =dx D 6 cos 6x. If f .x; y/ D sin xy then f = x D y cos xy.

  Spoken aloud, f = x is still "df d x:" It is a function of x and y. When more

is needed, call it "the partial of f with respect to x." The symbol f ½ is no longer

available, since it gives no special indication about x. Its replacement fx is pronounced
"f x" or "f sub x," which is shorter than f = x and means the same thing.

We may also want to indicate the point .x0; y0/ where the derivative is computed:

     f                                                         §          or just   f
     x .x0; y0/ or fx .x0; y0/ or                                                            :
                                                           f§
                                                                                       x0

                                                           x §.x0;y0/

EXAMPLE 2 f .x; y/Dsin 2x cos y fx D2 cos 2x cos y (cos y is constant for
 = x)

  The particular point .x0; y0/ is .0; 0/. The height of the surface is f .0; 0/ D 0.
The slope in the x direction is fx D 2. At a different point x0 D ; y0 D  we find

fx.; / D ¡2.

Now keep x constant and vary y. The ratio f =y approaches f = y:

            fy.x; y/ D lim f D lim f .x; y C y/ ¡ f .x; y/: (2)
                            y 0 y y 0                                y

This is the slope in the y direction. Please realize that a surface can go up in the x

direction and down in the y direction. The plane f .x; y/ D 3x ¡ 4y has fx D 3 (up)
and fy D ¡4 (down). We will soon ask what happens in the 45¥ direction.

The x derivative of x2 C y2 is really one-variable calculus, because y is constant.

550                                    13 Partial Derivatives

       The graph is a cone. Above the point .0; 2/ the height is 02 C 22D2. The partial
     derivatives are fx D 0=2 and fy D 2=2. At that point, Figure 13.5 climbs in the y
     direction. It is level in the x direction. An actual step x will increase 02 C 22 to
     .x/2 C 22. But this change is of order .x/2 and the x derivative is zero.

       Figure 13.5 is rather important. It shows how f = x and f = y are the ordinary
     derivatives of f .x; y0/ and f .x0; y/. It is natural to call these partial functions. The
     first has y fixed at y0 while x varies. The second has x fixed at x0 while y varies.
     Their graphs are cross sections down the surface --cut out by the vertical planes
     y D y0 and x D x0. Remember that the level curve is cut out by the horizontal plane
     z D c.

     Fig. 13.5 Partial functions x2 C 22 and 02 C y2 of the distance function f D x2 C y2:

       The limits of f =x and f =y are computed as always. With partial functions
     we are back to a single variable. The partial derivative is the ordinary derivative
     of a partial function (constant y or constant x). For the cone, f = y exists at all
     points except .0; 0/. The figure shows how the cross section down the middle of the
     cone produces the absolute value function: f .0; y/ D y . It has one-sided derivatives
     but not a two-sided derivative.

       Similarly f = x will not exist at the sharp point of the cone. We develop the idea
     of a continuous function f .x; y/ as needed (the definition is in the exercises). Each
     partial derivative involves one direction, but limits and continuity involve all direc-
     tions. The distance function is continuous at .0; 0/, where it is not differentiable.

     EXAMPLE 4 f .x; y/ D y2 ¡ x2 f = x D ¡2x f = y D 2y
     Move in the x direction from .1; 3/. Then y2 ¡ x2 has the partial function 9 ¡ x2.

     With y fixed at 3, a parabola opens downward. In the y direction (along x D1) the

     partial function y2 ¡ 1 opens upward. The surface in Figure 13.6 is called a hyper-
     bolic paraboloid, because the level curves y2 ¡ x2Dc are hyperbolas. Most people

     call it a saddle, and the special point at the origin is a saddle point. The origin is spe-

     cial for y2 ¡ x2 because both derivatives are zero. The bottom of the y parabola at

     .0; 0/ is the top of the x parabola. The surface is momentarily flat in all directions.
     It is the top of a hill and the bottom of a mountain range at the same time. A saddle
     point is neither a maximum nor a minimum, although both derivatives are zero.

     Note Do not think that f .x; y/ must contain y2 and x2 to have a saddle point.
     The function 2xy does just as well. The level curves 2xy D c are still hyperbolas.
     The partial functions 2xy0 and 2x0y now give straight lines--which is remarkable.

     Along the 45¥ line x D y, the function is 2x2 and climbing. Along the ¡45¥ line

Example 5 shows more variables. Example 6 shows that the variables may not be
named x and y. Also, the function may not be named f ! Pressure and temperature
and volume are P and T and V . The letters change but nothing else:

There is no P = R because R is a constant from chemistry--not a variable.
  Physics produces six variables for a moving body--the coordinates x; y; z and

the momenta px; py ; pz. Economics and the social sciences do better than that.
If there are 26 products there are 26 variables--sometimes 52, to show prices as
well as amounts. The profit can be a complicated function of these variables. The
partial derivatives are the marginal profits, as one of the 52 variables is changed. A
spreadsheet shows the 52 values and the effect of a change. An infinitesimal
spreadsheet shows the derivative.

                                        SECOND DERIVATIVE

Genius is not essential, to move to second derivatives. The only difficulty is that two
first derivatives fx and fy lead to four second derivatives fxx and fxy and fyx and
fyy . (Two subscripts: fxx is the x derivative of the x derivative. Other notations are

 2f = x2 and 2f = x y and 2f = y x and 2f = y2.) Fortunately fxy equals
fyx, as we see first by example.

EXAMPLE 7 f D x=y has fx D 1=y, which has fxx D 0 and fxy D ¡1=y2.

The function x=y is linear in x (which explains fxx D 0). Its y derivative is fy D

¡x=y2. This has the x derivative fyx D ¡1=y2. The mixed derivatives fxy and

fyx are equal.
  In the pure y direction, the second derivative is fyy D 2x=y3. One-variable calcu-

lus is sufficient for all these derivatives, because only one variable is moving.
552                                              13 Partial Derivatives

                  EXAMPLE 8 f D 4x2 C 3xy C y2 has fx D 8x C 3y and fy D 3x C 2y.
                  Both "cross derivatives" fxy and fyx equal 3. The second derivative in the x
                  direction is 2f = x2 D 8 or fxx D 8. Thus "f x x" is "d second f d x squared."
                  Similarly 2f = y2 D 2. The only change is from d to .

                    If f .x; y/ has continuous second derivatives then fxy D fyx. Problem 43 sketches
                  a proof based on the Mean Value Theorem. For third derivatives almost any example
                  shows that fxxy D fxyx D fyxx is different from fyyx D fyxy D fxyy .

                  Question How do you plot a space curve x.t /, y.t /, z.t / in a plane? One way is

                  to look parallel to the direction .1; 1; 1/. On your X Y screen, plot X D .y ¡ x/= 2
                  and Y D .2z ¡ x ¡ y/= 6. The line x D y D z goes to the point .0; 0/!

                    How do you graph a surface z D f .x; y/? Use the same X and Y . Fix x and let

                  y vary, for curves one way in the surface. Then fix y and vary x, for the other partial

         13.3 Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations

     Over a short range, a smooth curve y D f .x/ is almost straight. The curve changes

     direction, but the tangent line y ¡ y0 D f ½.x0/.x ¡ x0/ keeps the same slope

     forever. The tangent line immediately gives the linear approximation to y D f .x/ W

     y y0 C f ½.x0/.x ¡ x0/:

       What happens with two variables? The function is z D f .x; y/; and its graph is
     a surface. We are at a point on that surface, and we are near-sighted. We don't see
     far away. The surface may curve out of sight at the horizon, or it may be a bowl or
     a saddle. To our myopic vision, the surface looks flat. We believe we are on a plane
     (not necessarily horizontal), and we want the equation of this tangent plane.

     Notation The basepoint has coordinates x0 and y0. The height on the surface is
     z0 D f .x0; y0/. Other letters are possible: the point can be .a; b/ with height w. The
     subscript 0 indicates the value of x or y or z or f = x or f = y at the point.

       With one variable the tangent line has slope df =dx. With two variables there are
     two derivatives f = x and f = y. At the particular point, they are . f = x/0 and
     . f = y/0. Those are the slopes of the tangent plane . Its equation is the key to
     this chapter:

     13A The tangent plane at .x0; y0; z0/ has the same slopes as the surface z D
     f .x; y/: The equation of the tangent plane (a linear equation) is

     z ¡ z0 D   f  .x ¡ x0/ C   f  .y ¡ y0/:                                             (1)

               x0              y0

     The normal vector N to that plane has components . f = x/0; . f = y/0; ¡1.

     EXAMPLE 1 Find the tangent plane to z D 14 ¡ x2 ¡ y2 at .x0; y0; z0/ D .1; 2; 9/.

     Solution The derivatives are f = x D ¡2x and f = y D ¡2y. When x D 1 and
     y D 2 those are . f = x/0 D ¡2 and . f = y/0 D ¡4. The equation of the tangent

     plane is

     z ¡ 9 D ¡2.x ¡ 1/ ¡ 4.y¡ 2/ or z C 2x C 4y D 19:                                    (2)

     This z.x; y/ has derivatives ¡2 and ¡4; just like the surface. So the plane is tangent.
      The normal vector N has components ¡2; ¡4; ¡1: The equation of the normal

     line is .x; y; z/ D .1; 2; 9/ C t.¡2; ¡4; ¡1/: Starting from .1; 2; 9/ the line goes out

     along N--perpendicular to the plane and the surface.
       Figure 13.7 shows more detail about the tangent plane. The dotted lines are the x

     and y tangent lines. They lie in the plane. All tangent lines lie in the tangent plane!
     These particular lines are tangent to the "partial functions"--where y is fixed at y0 D
     2 or x is fixed at x0 D 1. The plane is balancing on the surface and touching at the
     tangent point.

       More is true. In the surface, every curve through the point is tangent to the plane.
     Geometrically, the curve goes up to the point and "kisses" the plane. The tangent

     T to the curve and the normal N to the surface are perpendicular: T ¤ N D 0.

     EXAMPLE 2 Find the tangent plane to the sphere z2 D 14 ¡ x2 ¡ y2 at .1; 2; 3/:

      A safer word is "osculate." At saddle points the plane is kissed from both sides.
             13.3 Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations                                                      555

    Fig. 13.7 The tangent plane contains the x and y tangent lines, perpendicular to N.

Solution Instead of z D 14 ¡ x2 ¡ y2 we have z D 14 ¡ x2 ¡ y2: At x0 D 1;

y0 D 2 the height is now z0 D 3. The surface is a sphere with radius 14. The only
trouble from the square root is its derivatives:

    zD              14 ¡ x2 ¡ y2 D           21 .¡2x/                        z D 21 .¡2y/ (3)
    xx                                      14 ¡ x2 ¡ y2 and                 y 14 ¡ x2 ¡ y2

At  .1;  2/  those  slopes  are  ¡  1  and  ¡  2  :  The  equation  of  the  tangent  plane  is  linear:  z  ¡
3 D ¡31.x ¡ 1/ ¡ 13 .y ¡ 2/. I cannot resist improving the equation, by multiplying33

through by 3 and moving all terms to the left side:

             tangent plane to sphere W 1.x ¡ 1/ C 2.y ¡ 2/ C 3.z ¡ 3/ D 0: (4)

If mathematics is the "science of patterns," equation (4) is a prime candidate for study.
The numbers 1; 2; 3 appear twice. The coordinates are .x0; y0; z0/ D .1; 2; 3/: The
normal vector is 1i C 2j C 3k: The tangent equation is 1x C 2y C 3z D 14: None of

this can be an accident, but the square root of 14 ¡ x2 ¡ y2 made a simple pattern

look complicated.

  This square root is not necessary. Calculus offers a direct way to find dz=dx--
implicit differentiation. Just differentiate every term as it stands:

 x2 C y2 C z2 D 14 leads to 2x C 2z z= x D 0 and 2y C 2z z= y D 0:

                                                                                              (5)

Canceling the 2's, the derivatives on a sphere are ¡x=z and ¡y=z. Those are the

same as in (3). The equation for the tangent plane has an extremely symmetric form:

z ¡ z0 D ¡ x0 .x ¡ x0/ ¡ y0 .y ¡ y0/ or x0.x ¡ x0/ C y0.y ¡ y0/ C z0.z ¡ z0/ D 0:

     Reading off N D x0i C y0j C z0k from the last equation, calculus proves something
     we already knew: The normal vector to a sphere points outward along the
     radius.

                              THE TANGENT PLANE TO F.x; y; z/ D c

     The sphere suggests a question that is important for other surfaces. Suppose the
     equation is F .x; y; z/ D c instead of z D f .x; y/: Can the partial derivatives and
     tangent plane be found directly from F ?

       The answer is yes. It is not necessary to solve first for z: The derivatives of F;
     computed at .x0; y0; z0/, give a second formula for the tangent plane and normal
     vector.

     13B The tangent plane to the surface F .x; y; z/ D c has the linear equation

                F  .x ¡ x0/ C   F  .y ¡ y0/ C   F  .z ¡ z0/ D 0: (7)

               x0              y0              z0

      The normal vector is N D F   i C F   j C F  k:
                               x0  y0          z0

     Notice how this includes the original case z D f .x; y/. The function F becomes

     f .x; y/ ¡ z: Its partial derivatives are f = x and f = y and ¡1: (The ¡1 is from
     the derivative of ¡z:) Then equation (7) is the same as our original tangent equa-

     tion (1).

     EXAMPLE 3 The surface F D x2 C y2 ¡ z2 D c is a hyperboloid. Find its tangent

     plane.

     Solution  The partial derivatives are Fx D 2x; Fy D 2y; Fz D ¡2z: Equation (7)
     is

          tangent plane W 2x0.x ¡ x0/ C 2y0.y ¡ y0/ ¡ 2z0.z ¡ z0/ D 0: (8)

     We can cancel the 2's. The normal vector is N D x0i C y0j ¡ z0k. For c 0 this

     hyperboloid has one sheet (Figure 13.8). For c D 0 it is a cone and for c 0 it

     breaks into two sheets (Problem 13.1.26).

                                           DIFFERENTIALS

Come back to the linear equation z ¡ z0 D . z= x/0.x ¡ x0/ C . z= y/0.y ¡ y0/

for the tangent plane. That may be the most important formula in this chapter. Move
along the tangent plane instead of the curved surface. Movements in the plane are
dx and dy and dz--while x and y and z are movements in the surface. The
d 's are governed by the tangent equation--the 's are governed by z D f .x; y/. In
Chapter 2 the d 's were differentials along the tangent line:

   dy D .dy=dx/dx (straight line) and y .dy=dx/x (on the curve): (9)

Now y is independent like x. The dependent variable is z. The idea is the same. The

distances x ¡ x0 and y ¡ y0 and z ¡ z0 (on the tangent plane) are dx and dy and dz.

The equation of the plane is

             dz D . z= x/0dx C . z= y/0dy or df D fxdx C fydy: (10)

This is the total differential. All letters dz and df and dw can be used, but z and
 f are not used. Differentials suggest small movements in x and y; then dz is the

resulting movement in z. On the tangent plane, equation (10) holds exactly.
  A "centering transform" has put x0; y0; z0 at the center of coordinates. Then the

"zoom transform" stretches the surface into its tangent plane.

dA.

Solution The base has length b and the sloping side has length a. The angle
between them is  . You may prefer A D 12 bh; where h is the perpendicular height
                                                                                1
a  sin    .  Either  way  we  need   the  partial  derivatives.    If    A   D  2  ab  sin    ,  then

                A D 1 b sin  A D 1 a sin  A D 1 ab cos : (11)

These lead immediately to the total differential dA (like a product rule):

 dA D A   da C A   db C A d D 1 b sin  da C 1 a sin  db C 1 ab cos  d:
             a                b                           2                        2                   2

EXAMPLE 5 The volume of a cylinder is V D  r2h. Decide whether V is more
sensitive to a change from r D 1:0 to r D 1:1 or from h D 1:0 to h D 1:1.

Solution The partial derivatives are V = r D 2 rh and V = h D  r2 . They

measure the sensitivity to change. Physically, they are the side area and base area

of the cylinder. The volume differential d V comes from a shell around the side plus

a layer on top:           d V D shell C layer D 2 rh dr C  r2dh:

                                                                                                          (12)

Starting from r D h D 1, that differential is d V D 2dr C dh. With dr D dh D :1,

the shell volume is :2 and the layer volume is only :1. So V is sensitive to dr.

  For a short cylinder like a penny, the layer has greater volume. V is more sensitive
to dh. In our case V D  r2h increases from .1/3 to .1:1/3. Compare V to

dV :

 V D .1:1/3 ¡ .1/3 D :331 and d V D 2.:1/ C .:1/ D :300:
The difference is V ¡ d V D :031. The shell and layer missed a small volume

in Figure 13.9, just above the shell and around the layer. The mistake is of order
.dr/2 C .dh/2. For V D  r2h, the differential d V D 2 rh dr C  r2dh is a linear

approximation to the true change V . We now explain that properly.

                                                     LINEAR APPROXIMATION

                Tangents lead immediately to linear approximations. That is true of tangent planes
                as it was of tangent lines. The plane stays close to the surface, as the line stayed close
                to the curve. Linear functions are simpler than f .x/ or f .x; y/ or F .x; y; z/. All we
                need are first derivatives at the point. Then the approximation is good near the point.

                  This key idea of calculus is already present in differentials. On the plane, df equals
                fxdx C fydy. On the curved surface that is a linear approximation to f :

                13C The linear approximation to f .x; y/ near the point .x0; y0/ is

                          f .x; y/ f .x0; y0/ C      f          .x ¡ x0/ C      f         .y ¡ y0/: (13)

                                                            x0                        y0

                In other words f fxx C fyy, as proved in Problem 24. The right side of

                (13) is a linear function fL.x; y/. At .x0; y0/, the functions f and fL have the same

                slopes. Then f .x; y/ curves away from fL with an error of "second order:"

                                     f .x; y/ ¡ fL.x; y/ M OE.x ¡ x0/2 C .y ¡ y0/2:                       (14)

                This assumes that fxx; fxy, and fyy are continuous and bounded by M along the line

                from .x0; y0/ to .x; y/. Example 3 of Section 13.5 shows that ftt 2M along that
                                  1                                                      ¡ fL
                line.  A  factor  2  comes  from  equation  3.8.12,  for  the  error  f        with  one  variable.

                For the volume of a cylinder, r and h went from 1.0 to 1.1. The second derivatives of

                V D  r2h are Vrr D 2h and Vrh D 2 r and Vhh D 0. They are below M D 2:2.
                Then (14) gives the error bound 2:2.:12 C :12/ D :044, not far above the actual

                error :031. The main point is that the error in linear approximation comes from

                the quadratic terms--those are the first terms to be ignored by fL.

     Fig. 13.9  Shell plus layer gives dV D :300.               Fig. 13.10 Quantity Q and price P move with the
                Including top ring gives V D :331.                              lines.

                EXAMPLE 6 Find a linear approximation to the distance function r D x2 C y2.

                Solution The partial derivatives are x=r and y=r. Then r .x=r/x C .y=r/y.

                For .x; y; r/ near .1; 2; 5/W x2 C y2 12 C 22 C .x ¡ 1/= 5 C 2.y ¡ 2/= 5:

                If y is fixed at 2, this is a one-variable approximation to x2 C 22. If x is fixed at 1,
                it is a linear approximation in y. Moving both variables, you might think dr would
13.3 Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations                                             559

involve dx and dy in a square root. It doesn't. Distance involves x and y in a square
root, but: change of distance is linear in x and y--to a first approximation.

  There is a rough point at x D 0; y D 0. Any movement from .0; 0/ gives r D
   .x/2 C .y/2. The square root has returned. The reason is that the partial
derivatives x=r and y=r are not continuous at .0; 0/. The cone has a sharp point
with no tangent plane. Linear approximation breaks down.

  The next example shows how to approximate z from x and y, when the
equation is F .x; y; z/ D c. We use the implicit derivatives in (7) instead of the
explicit derivatives in (1). The idea is the same: Look at the tangent equation as a
way to find z, instead of an equation for z. Here is Example 6 with new letters.

EXAMPLE 7 From F D ¡x2 ¡ y2 C z2 D 0 find a linear approximation to z:
Solution (implicit derivatives) Use the derivatives of FW ¡2xx ¡ 2yy C 2zz

0. Then solve for z, which gives z .x=z/x C .y=z/y--the same as
Example 6.

EXAMPLE 8 How does the equilibrium price change when the supply curve changes?

The equilibrium price is at the intersection of the supply and demand curves

(supply D demand). As the price p rises, the demand q drops (the slope is ¡:2):

demand line DD W p D ¡:2q C 40:                                                     (15)

The supply (also q) goes up with the price. The slope s is positive (here s D :4/:

supply line S S W p D sq C t D :4q C 10:

Those lines are in Figure 13.10. They meet at the equilibrium price P D $30. The
quantity Q D 50 is available at P (on S S ) and demanded at P (on DD). So it is
sold.

  Where do partial derivatives come in? The reality is that those lines DD and S S
are not fixed for all time. Technology changes, and competition changes, and the
value of money changes. Therefore the lines move. Therefore the crossing point .Q; P /

also moves. Please recognize that derivatives are hiding in those sentences.
  Main point: The equilibrium price P is a function of s and t . Reducing s by

better technology lowers the supply line to p D :3q C 10. The demand line has not
changed. The customer is as eager or stingy as ever. But the price P and quantity Q
are different. The new equilibrium is at Q D 60 and P D $28, where the new line
XX crosses DD.

  If the technology is expensive, the supplier will raise t when reducing s. Line Y Y
is p D :3q C 20. That gives a higher equilibrium P D $32 at a lower quantity Q D
40--the demand was too weak for the technology.

Calculus question Find P = s and P = t . The difficulty is that P is not given as
a function of s and t . So take implicit derivatives of the supply = demand equations:

supply D demand W      P D¡ :2Q C 40 D sQ C t                  (16)
       s derivative W     Ps D ¡:2QsD sQs C Q  .note ts D 0/
       t derivative W     Pt D ¡:2QtD sQt C 1  .note tt D 1/

Now substitute s D :4; t D 10; P D 30; Q D 50. That is the starting point, around which
we are finding a linear approximation. The last two equations give Ps D 50=3 and
560             13 Partial Derivatives

     Pt D 1=3 (Problem 25). The linear approximation is

                P D 30 C 50.s ¡ :4/=3 C.t ¡ 10/=3           (17)

     Comment This example turned out to be subtle (so is economics) . I hesitated before
     including it. The equations are linear and their derivatives are easy, but something
     in the problem is hard--there is no explicit formula for P . The function P .s; t / is
     not known. Instead of a point on a surface, we are following the intersection of two
     lines. The solution changes as the equation changes.The derivative of the solution
     comes from the derivative of the equation.

     Summary The foundation of this section is equation (1) for the tangent plane.
     Every thing builds on that--total differential, linear approximation, sensitivity to small
     change. Later sections go on to the chain rule and "directional derivatives" and
     "gradients." The central idea of differential calculus is f fxx C fyy.

                             NEWTON'S METHOD FOR TWO EQUATIONS

     Linear approximation is used to solve equations. To find out where a function is
     zero, look first to see where its approximation is zero. To find out where a graph
     crosses the xy plane, look to see where its tangent plane crosses.

       Remember Newton's method for f .x/ D 0. The current guess is xn. Around that

     point, f .x/ is close to f .xn/ C .x ¡ xn/f ½.xn/. This is zero at the next guess xnC1 D
     xn ¡ f .xn/=f ½.xn/. That is where the tangent line crosses the x axis.

       With two variables the idea is the same--but two unknowns x and y require two
     equations. We solve g.x; y/ D 0 and h.x; y/ D 0. Both functions have linear
     approximations that start from the current point .xn; yn/--where derivatives are
     computed:

            g.x; y/ g.xn; yn/ C . g= x/.x ¡ xn/ C . g= y/.y ¡ yn/ (18)
            h.x; y/ h.xn; yn/ C . h= x/.x ¡ xn/ C . h= y/.y ¡ yn/:

     The natural idea is to set these approximations to zero. That gives linear equations

     for x ¡ xn and y ¡ yn. Those are the steps x and y that take us to the next guess

     in Newton's method:

     13D Newton's method to solve g.x; y/ D 0 and h.x; y/ D 0 has linear equations
     for the steps x and y that go from .xn; yn/ to .xnC1; ynC1/:

      g  g      y D ¡g.xn; yn/ and   h  h                   y D ¡h.xn; yn/: (19)

     x       y                      x                    y

     EXAMPLE 9 g D x3 ¡ y D 0 and h D y3 ¡ x D 0 have 3 solutions .1; 1/; .0; 0/;
     .¡1; ¡1/.

     I will start at different points .x0; y0/. The next guess is x1 D x0 C x; y1 D y0 C
     y. It is of extreme interest to know which solution Newton's method will choose--if
     it converges at all. I made three small experiments.

The derivatives are gx D 3x2 D 12; gy D ¡1; hx D ¡1; hy D 3y2 D 3. The steps

x and y come from solving (19):

    12x ¡ y D ¡7                             x D ¡4=7                    x1 D x0 C x D 10=7

                                             y D C1=7

This new point .10=7; 8=7/ is closer to the solution at .1; 1/. The next point is .1:1;
1:05/ and convergence is clear. Soon convergence is fast.

2:  Start  at  .x0;  y0  /  D  .  1  ;  0/.  There  we  find  g  D  1=8  and  h  D  ¡1=2:

.3=4/x ¡ y D ¡1=8                            x D ¡1=2                    x1 D x0 C x D 0
   ¡x C 0y D C1=2

Newton has jumped from 21 ; 0 on the x axis to 0; ¡ 41  on the y axis. The next step

goes to .1=32; 0/; back on the x axis. We are in the "basin of attraction" of .0; 0/:

3: Now start further out the axis at .1; 0/, where g D 1 and h D ¡1:

    3x ¡ y D ¡1                              x D ¡1                      x1 D x0 C x D 0
    ¡x C 0y D C1                             y D ¡2
                                                                         y1 D y0 C y D ¡2:

 Newton moves from .1; 0/ to .0; ¡2/ to .16; 0/. Convergence breaks down--the

method blows up. This danger is ever-present, when we start far from a solution.

  Please recognize that even a small computer will uncover amazing patterns. It can
start from hundreds of points .x0; y0/, and follow Newton's method. Each solution
has a basin of attraction, containing all .x0; y0/ leading to that solution. There is
also a basin leading to infinity. The basins in Figure 13.11 are completely mixed
together--a color figure shows them as fractals. The most extreme behavior is on the
borderline between basins, when Newton can't decide which way to go. Frequently
we see chaos.

  Chaos is irregular movement that follows a definite rule. Newton's method
determines an iteration from each point .xn; yn/ to the next. In scientific problems
it normally converges to the solution we want. (We start close enough.) But the com-
puter makes it possible to study iterations from faraway points. This has created a new
part of mathematics--so new that any experiments you do are likely to be original.

  Section 3.7 found chaos when trying to solve x2 C 1 D 0: But don't think Newton's
method is a failure. On the contrary, it is the best method to solve nonlinear equations.
The error is squared as the algorithm converges, because linear approximations have
errors of order .x/2 C .y/2: Each step doubles the number of correct digits, near
the solution. The example shows why it is important to be near.

13.4 Directional Derivatives and Gradients

As x changes, we know how f .x; y/ changes. The partial derivative f = x treats
y as constant. Similarly f = y keeps x constant, and gives the slope in the y direc-

tion. But east-west and north-south are not the only directions to move. We could go

along a 45¥ line, where x D y. In principle, before we draw axes, no direction is

preferred. The graph is a surface with slopes in all directions.

  On that surface, calculus looks for the rate of change (or the slope). There is a

directional derivative, whatever the direction. In the 45¥ case we are inclined to

divide f by x, but we would be wrong. Let me state the problem. We are given
f .x; y/ around a point P D .x0; y0/. We are also given a direction u (a unit vector).
There must be a natural definition of Duf --the derivative of f in the direction u:
To compute this slope at P; we need a formula. Preferably the formula is based on

 f = x and f = y; which we already know.

  Note that the 45¥direction has u D i=2 C j=2. The square root of 2 is going to

enter the derivative. This shows that dividing f by x is wrong. We should divide
by the step length s.

EXAMPLE 1 Stay on the surface z D xy. When .x; y/ moves a distance s in the

45¥ direction from .1; 1/, what is z=s?

Solution The step is s times the unit vector u. Starting from x D y D 1 the step
ends at x D y D 1 C s= 2. (The components of us are s= 2:/ Then z D xy
is

z D .1 C s= 2/2 D 1 C  2s C 12 .s/2; which means z D  2s  C  1           .s  /2  :
                                                             2

The ratio z=s approaches 2 as s 0: That is the slope in the 45¥direction.

DEFINITION The derivative of f in the direction u at the point P is Duf .P /:

   Duf .P / D lim f D lim f .P C us/ ¡ f .P /: (1)
                       s 0 s s 0       s

The step from P D .x0; y0/ has length s. It takes us to .x0 C u1s; y0 C u2s/.

We compute the change f and divide by s. But formula (2) below saves time.

The x direction is u D .1; 0/: Then us is .s; 0/ and we recover f = x:

f D f .x0 C s; y0/ ¡ f .x0; y0/ approaches D.1;0/f D f :
s                      s                              x

Similarly Duf D f = y; when u D .0; 1/ is in the y direction. What is Duf when

u D .0; ¡1/? That is the negative y direction, so Duf D ¡ f = y.

                     CALCULATING THE DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE

Duf is the slope of the surface z D f .x; y/ in the direction u. How do you compute
it? From f = x and f = y; in two special directions, there is a quick way to find
Duf in all directions. Remember that u is a unit vector.

13E The directional derivative Duf in the direction u D .u1; u2/ equals

                          f       f

     The reasoning goes back to the linear approximation of f :

                          f            f          f                f
     f                       x C y D u1s C u2s:
                          x            y          x                y

     Divide by s and let s approach zero. Formula (2) is the limit of f =s; as
     the approximation becomes exact. A more careful argument guarantees this limit
     provided fx and fy are continuous at the basepoint .x0; y0/:

       Main point: Slopes in all directions are known from slopes in two directions.

                          Duf  is  as  large  as  possible  .with  u2   C  u2   D  1/:

                                                                     1       2

     To find those directions, look at Duf D 3u1 C u2: The level direction has 3u1 C

     u2 D 0: Then u is proportional to .1; ¡3/: Changing x by 1 and y by ¡3 produces

     no change in f D 3x C y C 1:

       In the steepest direction u is proportional to .3; 1/: Note the partial derivatives

     fx D 3 and fy D 1: The dot product of .3; 1/ and .1; ¡3/ is zero--steepest direction

     is perpendicular to level direction. To make .3; 1/ a unit vector, divide by 10:

     Steepest climb:      Duf D 3.3= 10/ C 1.1= 10/ D 10= 10 D 10
     Steepest descent:
                          Reverse to u D .¡3= 10; ¡1= 10/ and Duf D ¡ 10:

     The contour lines around a mountain follow Duf D 0. The creeks are perpendic-
     ular. On a plane like f D 3x C y C 1; those directions stay the same at all points

     (Figure 13.12). On a mountain the steepest direction changes as the slopes change.

                    THE GRADIENT VECTOR

Look again at fxu1 C fyu2; which is the directional derivative Duf: This is the dot
product of two vectors. One vector is u D .u1; u2/; which sets the direction. The
other vector is .fx; fy /; which comes from the function. This second vector is the

gradient.

                                                                       f                f
DEFINITION The gradient of f .x; y/ is the vector whose components are and :
                                                                       x                y

grad f D rf D f i C f  j add f  k in three dimensions :
                    xy  z

The space-saving symbol r is read as "grad." In Chapter 15 it becomes "del."
  For the linear function 3x C y C 1; the gradient is the constant vector .3; 1/: It

is the way to climb the plane. For the nonlinear function x2 C xy; the gradient is
the non-constant vector .2x C y; x/: Notice that grad f shares the two derivatives

in N D .fx; fy ; ¡1/: But the gradient is not the normal vector. N is in three dimen-

sions, pointing away from the surface z D f .x; y/: The gradient vector is in the xy
plane! The gradient tells which way on the surface is up, but it does that from down

in the base.
  The level curve is also in the xy plane, perpendicular to the gradient. The contour

map is a projection on the base plane of what the hiker sees on the mountain. The
vector grad f tells the direction of climb, and its length grad f gives the steepness.

13F The directional derivative is Duf D .grad f / ¤ u: The level direction is

perpendicular to grad f; since Duf D 0: The slope Duf is largest when u is

parallel to grad f: That maximum slope is the length grad f D  f2   C  f2   :

                                                                 x       y

for u D grad f      the slope is .grad f / ¤ u D grad f D grad f : 2
            grad f
                                                       grad f

The example f D 3x C y C 1 had grad f D .3; 1/: Its steepest slope was in the

direction u D .3; 1/= 10: The maximum slope was 10: That is grad f D 9 C 1:

 Important point: The maximum of .grad f / ¤ u is the length grad f : In nonlin-

ear examples, the gradient and steepest direction and slope will vary. But look at one
particular point in Figure 13.13. Near that point, and near any point, the linear picture
takes over.

 On the graph of f; the special vectors are the level direction L D .fy; ¡fx; 0/
and the uphill direction U D .fx; fy; fx2 C fy2/ and the normal N D .fx; fy ; ¡1/:

Problem 18 checks that those are perpendicular.

EXAMPLE 3 The gradient of f .x; y/ D .14 ¡ x2 ¡ y2/=3 is rf D .¡2x=3; ¡2y=3/:
On the surface, the normal vector is N D .¡2x=3; ¡2y=3; ¡1/: At the point .1; 2; 3/;
this perpendicular is N D .¡2=3; ¡4=3; ¡1/: At the point .1; 2/ down in the base,
the gradient is .¡2=3; ¡4=3/: The length of grad f is the slope 20=3:

  Probably a hiker does not go straight up. A "grade" of 20=3 is fairly steep
(almost 150%). To estimate the slope in other directions, measure the distance along
the path between two contour lines. If f D 1 in a distance s D 3 the slope is
about 1=3: This calculation is not exact until the limit of f =s, which is Duf:
568  13 Partial Derivatives

      Fig. 13.13 N perpendicular to surface and grad f perpendicular to level line (in the base).

     EXAMPLE 4 The gradient of f .x; y; z/ D xy C yz C xz has three components.

     The pattern extends from f .x; y/ to f .x; y; z/: The gradient is now the three-
     dimensional vector .fx; fy; fz /: For this function grad f is .y C z; x C z; x C y/:
     To draw the graph of w D f .x; y; z/ would require a four-dimensional picture, with
     axes in the xyzw directions.

       Notice the dimensions. The graph is a 3-dimensional "surface" in 4-dimensional
     space. The gradient is down below in the 3-dimensional base. The level sets of f
     come from xy C yz C zx D c--they are 2-dimensional. The gradient is perpendicu-
     lar to that level set (still down in 3 dimensions). The gradient is not N! The normal

     vector is .fx; fy; fz ; ¡1/; perpendicular to the surface up in 4-dimensional space.
     EXAMPLE 5 Find grad z when z.x; y/ is given implicitly: F .x; y; z/ D x2 C y2 ¡

     z2 D 0:

     In this case we find z D ¨ x2 C y2: The derivatives are ¨x= x2 C y2 and
     ¨y= x2 C y2, which go into grad z: But the point is this: To find that gradient

     faster, differentiate F .x; y; z/ as it stands. Then divide by Fz:

          Fxdx C Fydy C Fzdz D 0 or dz D .¡Fxdx ¡ Fydy/=Fz: (3)
     The gradient is .¡Fx=Fz; ¡Fy=Fz/: Those derivatives are evaluated at .x0; y0/:

     The computation does not need the explicit function z D f .x; y/:

      F D x2 C y2 ¡ z2 Fx D 2x; Fy D 2y; Fz D ¡2z grad z D .x=z; y=z/:

     To go uphill on the cone, move in the direction .x=z; y=z/: That gradient direction
     goes radially outward. The steepness of the cone is the length of the gradient vector:

             grad z D .x=z/2 C .y=z/2 D 1 because z2 D x2 C y2on the cone.

                                 DERIVATIVES ALONG CURVED PATHS

     On a straight path the derivative of f is Duf D .grad f / ¤ u: What is the derivative

     on a curved path? The path direction u is the tangent vector T. So replace u by T;
     which gives the "direction" of the curve.

       The path is given by the position vector R.t / D x.t /i C y.t /j: The velocity is
     v D .dx=dt /i C .dy=dt /j: The tangent vector is T D v= v : Notice the choice--to
13.4 Directional Derivatives and Gradients                                                     569

move at any speed (with v) or to go at unit speed (with T:) There is the same choice
for the derivative of f .x; y/ along this curve:

rate of change df D .grad f / ¤ v D f dx C f dy (4)
dt  x dt y dt

slope df D .grad f / ¤ T D f dx C f dy (5)
ds  x ds y ds

The first involves time. If we move faster, df =dt increases. The second involves
distance. If we move a distance ds, at any speed, the function changes by df: So
the slope in that direction is df =ds: Chapter 1 introduced velocity as df =dt and
slope as dy=dx and mixed them up. Finally we see the difference. Uniform motion
on a straight line has R D R0 C vt: The velocity v is constant. The direction T D u D

v= v is also constant. The directional derivative is .grad f / ¤ u, but the rate of change
is .grad f / ¤ v:

  Equations (4) and (5) look like chain rules. They are chain rules. The next section
extends df =dt D .df =dx/.dx=dt / to more variables, proving (4) and (5). Here we
focus on the meaning: df =ds is the derivative of f in the direction uDT along
the curve.

EXAMPLE 7 Find df =dt and df =ds for f D r: The curve is x D t 2; y D t in
Figure 13.14a.

Solution The velocity along the curve is v D 2t i C j: At the typical point t D 1 it is
v D 2i C j: The unit tangent is T D v= 5: The gradient is a unit vector i= 2 C j= 2
pointing outward, when f .x; y/ is the distance r from the center. The dot product
with v is df =dt D 3= 2: The dot product with T is df =ds D 3= 10:

  When we slow down to speed 1 (with T), the changes in f .x; y/ slow down too.

EXAMPLE 8 Find df =ds for f D xy along the circular path x D cos t; y D sin t:

First take a direct approach. On the circle, xy equals .cos t /.sin t /: Its derivative

comes from the product rule: df =dt D cos2 t ¡ sin2 t: Normally this is different from

df =ds, because the time t need not equal the arc length s: There is a speed factor
ds=dt to divide by--but here the speed is 1: (A circle of length s D 2 is completed

at t D 2:) Thus the slope df =ds along the roller-coaster in Figure 13.14 is cos2 t ¡

sin2 t:

Fig. 13.14 The distance f D r changes along the curve. The slope of the roller-coaster is

          (grad f )¤T: The distance D from .x0; y0/ has grad D D unit vector.

  The second approach uses the vectors grad f and T: The gradient of f D xy is

.y; x/ D .sin t; cos t /: The unit tangent vector to the path is T D .¡ sin t; cos t /: Their

     dot product is the same df =ds:

                                 GRADIENTS WITHOUT COORDINATES

     This section ends with a little "philosophy." What is the coordinate-free definition
     of the gradient? Up to now, grad f D .fx; fy / depended totally on the choice of x
     and y axes. But the steepness of a surface is independent of the axes. Those are added
     later, to help us compute.

       The steepness df =ds involves only f and the direction, nothing else. The gradient
     should be a "tensor"--its meaning does not depend on the coordinate system. The
     gradient has different formulas in different systems (xy or r or . . . ), but the direction
     and length of grad f are determined by df =ds--without any axes:

         The direction of grad f is the one in which df =ds is largest.
         The length grad f is that largest slope.

     The key equation is .change inf / .gradient off / ¤ .change in position/: That is

     another way to write f fxx C fyy: It is the multivariable form--we used
     two variables--of the basic linear approximation y .dy=dx/x:

     EXAMPLE 9 D.x; y/ D distance from .x; y/ to .x0; y0/: Without derivatives prove
     grad D D 1: The graph of D.x; y/ is a cone with slope 1 and sharp point .x0; y0/:

     First question In which direction does the distance D.x; y/ increase fastest?
     Answer Going directly away from .x0; y0/: Therefore this is the direction of grad D:

     Second question How quickly does D increase in that steepest direction?
     Answer A step of length s increases D by s: Therefore grad D D s=s D
     1:

     Conclusion grad D is a unit vector. The derivatives of D in Problem 48 are

     .x ¡ x0/=D and .y ¡ y0/=D: The sum of their squares is 1, because .x ¡ x0/2 C
     .y ¡ y0/2 equals D2:

                            13.5 The Chain Rule

Calculus goes back and forth between solving problems and getting ready for
harder problems. The first is "application," the second looks like "theory." If we
minimize f to save time or money or energy, that is an application. If we don't take
derivatives to find the minimum--maybe because f is a function of other functions,
and we don't have a chain rule--then it is time for more theory. The chain rule is
a fundamental working tool, because f .g.x// appears all the time in applications.
So do f .g.x; y// and f .x.t /; y.t // and worse. We have to know their derivatives.
Otherwise calculus can't continue with the applications.

  You may instinctively say: Don't bother with the theory, just teach me the formulas.
That is not possible. You now regard the derivative of sin 2x as a trivial problem,
unworthy of an answer. That was not always so. Before the chain rule, the slopes of
sin 2x and sin x2 and sin2 x2 were hard to compute from f =x: We are now at
the same point for f .x; y/: We know the meaning of f = x; but if f D r tan  and
x D r cos  and y D r sin ; we need a way to compute f = x: A little theory is
unavoidable, if the problem-solving part of calculus is to keep going.

  To repeat: The chain rule applies to a function of a function. In one variable
that was f .g.x//: With two variables there are more possibilities:

1: f .z/ with z D g.x; y/            Find f = x and f = y

2: f .x; y/ with x D x.t/; y D y.t/  Find df =dt

3: f .x; y/ with x D x.t; u/; y D y.t; u/ Find f = t and f = u

All derivatives are assumed continuous. More exactly, the input derivatives like
 g= x and dx=dt and x= u are continuous. Then the output derivatives like f = x

and df =dt and f = u will be continuous from the chain rule. We avoid points like
r D 0 in polar coordinates--where r= x D x=r has a division by zero.

A Typical Problem Start with a function of x and y; for example x times y: Thus
f .x; y/ D xy: Change x to r cos  and y to r sin : The function becomes .r cos  /
times .r sin  /: We want its derivatives with respect to r and : First we have to
decide on its name.

  To be correct, we should not reuse the letter f: The new function can be F :
         f .x; y/ D xy f .r cos ; r sin  / D .r cos  /.r sin  / D F .r;  /:

Why not call it f .r;  /? Because strictly speaking that is r times  ! If we follow the
rules, then f .x; y/ is xy and f .r;  / should be r: The new function F does the
right thing--it multiplies .r cos  /.r sin  /: But in many cases, the rules get bent and
the letter F is changed back to f:

  This crime has already occurred. The end of the last page ought to say F= t:
Instead the printer put f = t: The purpose of the chain rule is to find derivatives in
the new variables t and u (or r and  ). In our example we want the derivative of F
with respect to r: Here is the chain rule:

F D f x C f y D .y/.cos  / C .x/.sin  / D 2r sin  cos :
r xr yr

I substituted r sin  and r cos  for y and x: You immediately check the answer:
F .r;  / D r2 cos  sin  does lead to F= r D 2r cos  sin : The derivative is cor-

rect. The only incorrect thing--but we do it anyway--is to write f instead of F:

                         f  Answer It is f x C f y :

                                  THE DERIVATIVES OF f .g.x; y//

     Here g depends on x and y; and f depends on g: Suppose x moves by dx; while y
     stays constant. Then g moves by dg D . g= x/dx:When g changes, f also changes:
     df D.df =dg/dg: Now substitute for dg to make the chain: df D .df =dg/. g= x/dx:
     This is the first rule:

     13G Chain rule for f .g.x; y// W f D df g and        f D df g : (1)
                                                  x dg x  y dg y

     EXAMPLE 1 Every f .x C cy/ satisfies the 1-way wave equation f = y D c f = x:

     The inside function is g D x C cy: The outside function can be anything, g2 or sin g
     or eg : The composite function is .x C cy/2 or sin.x C cy/ or exCcy : In each separate
     case we could check that f = y D c f = x: The chain rule produces this equation
     in all cases at once, from g= x D 1 and g= y D c:

     f D df g D 1 df and  f D df g D c df so              f D c f : (2)
     x dg x dg            y dg y dg                       y      x

     This is important: f = y D c f = x is our first example of a partial differential
     equation. The unknown f .x; y/ has two variables. Two partial derivatives enter the
     equation.

       Up to now we have worked with dy=dt and ordinary differential equations.
     The independent variable was time or space (and only one dimension in space). For
     partial differential equations the variables are time and space (possibly several
     dimensions in space). The great equations of mathematical physics--heat equation,
     wave equation, Laplace's equation--are partial differential equations.

       Notice how the chain rule applies to f D sin xy: Its x derivative is y cos xy: A
     patient reader would check that f is sin g and g is xy and fx is fg gx: Probably you
     are not so patient--you know the derivative of sin xy: Therefore we pass quickly to
     the next chain rule. Its outside function depends on two inside functions, and each of
     those depends on t: We want df =dt:

        THE DERIVATIVE OF f .x.t/; y.t//

     Before the formula, here is the idea. Suppose t changes by t: That affects x and
     y; they change by x and y: There is a domino effect on f ; it changes by f:
     Tracing backwards,

     f f x C f y and x dx t and y dy t:
     x  y                 dt                                 dt

     Substitute the last two into the first, connecting f to t: Then let t 0:

      13H Chain rule for f .x.t/; y.t// W df D f dx C f dy : (3)
                                                   dt x dt y dt

     This is close to the one-variable rule dz=dx D .dz=dy/.dy=dx/: There we could
     "cancel" dy: (We actually canceled y in (z=y/.y=x), and then approached
     the limit.) Now t affects f in two ways, through x and through y: The chain rule
     has two terms. If we cancel in . f = x/.dx=dt / we only get one of the terms!
          13.5 The Chain Rule                                                                     575

  We mention again that the true name for f .x.t /; y.t // is F .t / not f .t /: For f .x; y; z/
the rule has three terms: fx xt C fyyt C fzzt is ft (or better dF=dt:)

EXAMPLE 2 How quickly does the temperature change when you drive to Florida?

Suppose the Midwest is at 30¥F and Florida is at 80¥F. Going 1000 miles south
increases the temperature f .x; y/ by 50¥; or .05 degrees per mile. Driving straight

south at 70 miles per hour, the rate of increase is .:05/.70/ D 3:5 degrees per hour.
Note how .degrees=mile/ times .miles=hour/ equals .degrees=hour/. That is the
ordinary chain rule .df =dx/.dx=dt / D .df =dt /--there is no y variable going south.

  If the road goes southeast, the temperature is f D 30 C :05x C :01y: Now x.t / is
distance south and y.t / is distance east. What is df =dt if the speed is still 70?

Solution  df D f dx C f dy D :05 70 C :01 70  3 degrees=hour.
          dt x dt y dt  2      2

In reality there is another term. The temperature also depends directly on t; because
of night and day. The factor cos.2 t =24/ has a period of 24 hours, and it brings an
extra term into the chain rule:

          For f .x; y; t/ the chain rule is df D f dx C f dy C f : (4)
                                                 dt x dt y dt t

This is the total derivative df =dt; from all causes. Changes in x; y; t all affect f:

The partial derivative f = t is only one part of df =dt: (Note that dt =dt D 1:) If

night and day add 12 cos.2 t =24/ to f; the extra term is f = t D ¡ sin.2 t =24/:
At nightfall that is ¡ degrees per hour. You have to drive faster than 70 mph to get

warm.

                                       SECOND DERIVATIVES

What is d 2f =dt 2? We need the derivative of (4), which is painful. It is like acceler-
ation in Chapter 12, with many terms. So start with movement in a straight line.

  Suppose x D x0 C t cos  and y D y0 C t sin : We are moving at the fixed angle
; with speed 1: The derivatives are xt D cos  and yt D sin  and cos2  C sin2  D
1: Then df =dt is immediate from the chain rule:

          ft D fxxt C fyyt D fx cos  C fy sin :                      (5)

For the second derivative ftt ; apply this rule to ft : Then ftt is

.ft /x cos  C .ft /y sin  D .fxx cos  C fyx sin  / cos  C .fxy cos  C fyy sin  / sin :

Collect terms: ftt D fxx cos2  C 2fxy cos  sin  C fyy sin2 :         (6)

In polar coordinates change t to r: When we move in the r direction,  is fixed.
Equation (6) gives frr from fxx ; fxy; fyy : Second derivatives on curved paths (with
new terms from the curving) are saved for the exercises.

EXAMPLE 3 If fxx; fxy ; fyy are all continuous and bounded by M; find a bound
on ftt : This is the second derivative along any line.

Solution Equation (6) gives ftt M cos2  C M sin 2 C M sin2  2M: This
upper bound 2M was needed in equation 13.3.14, for the error in linear approxima-
tion.

                             THE DERIVATIVES OF f .x.t; u/; y.t; u//

     Suppose there are two inside functions x and y; each depending on t and u: When
     t moves, x and y both move: dx D xt dt and dy D ytdt: Then dx and dy force a
     change in f : df D fxdx C fydy: The chain rule for f = t is no surprise:

                                                    t xt yt

     This rule has = t instead of d=dt; because of the extra variable u: The symbols
     remind us that u is constant. Similarly t is constant while u moves, and there is a
     second chain rule for f = u: fu D fxxu C fyyu:

     EXAMPLE 4 In polar coordinates find f and f : Start from f .x; y/ D f .r cos ; r sin  /:
     The chain rule uses the  derivatives of x and y:

         x y      x                      y

     The second  derivative is harder, because (8) has four terms that depend on :
     Apply the chain rule to the first term f = x: It is a function of x and y; and x
     and y are functions of  :

     The  derivative of f = y is similar. So apply the product rule to (8):

          f D OEfxx.¡r sin  / C fxy.r cos  /.¡r sin  / C fx.¡r cos  /
               COEfyx.¡r sin  / C fyy.r cos  /.r cos  / C fy.¡r sin  /: (9)

     This formula is not attractive. In mathematics, a messy formula is almost always a

     signal of asking the wrong question. In fact the combination fxx C fyy is much more
     special than the separate derivatives. We might hope the same for frr C f ; but di-
     mensionally that is impossible--since r is a length and  is an angle. The dimensions
     of fxx and fyy are matched by frr and fr =r and f =r2: We could even hope that

                     1       1
           fxx C fyy D frr C fr C 2 f :     (10)
                     rr

     This equation is true. Add (5) + (6) + (9) with t changed to r: Laplace's equation
     fxx C fyy D 0 is now expressed in polar coordinates: frr C fr =r C f =r2 D 0:

                  A PARADOX

     Before leaving polar coordinates there is one more question. It goes back to r= x;
     which was practically the first example of partial derivatives:

           rD  x2 C y2 D x= x2 C y2 D x=r:  (11)
           xx

     My problem is this. We know that x is r cos : So x=r on the right side is cos : On
     the other hand r is x= cos : So r= x is also 1= cos : How can r= x lead to
     cos  one way and 1= cos  the other way?
         13.5 The Chain Rule                                                                577

  I will admit that this cost me a sleepless night. There must be an explanation--
we cannot end with cos  D 1= cos : This paradox brings a new respect for partial
derivatives. May I tell you what I finally noticed? You could cover up the next
paragraph and think about the puzzle first.

  The key to partial derivatives is to ask: Which variable is held constant? In
equation (11), y is constant. But when r D x= cos  gave r= x D 1= cos ;  was
constant. In both cases we change x and look at the effect on r. The movement is
on a horizontal line (constant y) or on a radial line (constant  ). Figure 13.15 shows
the difference.

Remark This example shows that r= x is different from 1=. x= r/: The neat
formula . r= x/. x= r/ D 1 is not generally true. May I tell you what takes its
place? We have to include . r= y/. y= r/: With two variables xy and two vari-
ables r; we need 2 by 2 matrices! Section 14.4 gives the details:

"              #"   x=   #" #
   r= x  r= y x= r               10
   = x   = y y= r             D      :
                    y            01

Fig. 13.15 dr D dx cos  when y is constant, dr D dx= cos  when  is constant.

                                NON-INDEPENDENT VARIABLES

This paradox points to a serious problem. In computing partial derivatives of f .x; y; z/;
we assumed that x; y; z were independent. Up to now, x could move while y and z
were fixed. In physics and chemistry and economics that may not be possible. If there
is a relation between x; y; z; then x can't move by itself.

EXAMPLE 5 The gas law P V D nRT relates pressure to volume and tempera-
ture. P; V; T are not independent. What is the meaning of V = P ? Does it equal
1=. P = V /?

Those questions have no answers, until we say what is held constant. In the paradox,
 r= x had one meaning for fixed y and another meaning for fixed : To indicate

what is held constant, use an extra subscript (not denoting a derivative):

. r= x/y D cos  . r= x/ D 1= cos :                                            (12)

. f = P /V has constant volume and . f = P /T has constant temperature. The usual
 f = P has both V and T constant. But then the gas law won't let us change P:

EXAMPLE 6 Let f D 3x C 2y C z: Compute f = x on the plane z D 4x C y:
578                     13 Partial Derivatives

     Solution 1         Think of x and y as independent. Replace z by 4x C y:
                           f D 3x C 2y C .4x C y/ so . f = x/y D 7:

     Solution 2 Keep x and y independent. Deal with z by the chain rule:

                  . f = x/y D f = x C . f = z/. z= x/ D 3 C .1/.4/ D 7:

     Solution 3 (different) Make x and z independent. Then y D z ¡ 4x:
           . f = x/z D f = x C . f = y/. y= x/ D 3 C .2/.¡4/ D ¡5:

     Without a subscript, f = x means: Take the x derivative the usual way. The answer
     is f = x D 3; when y and z don't move. But on the plane z D 4x C y; one of them
     must move! 3 is only part of the total answer, which is . f = x/y D 7 or . f = x/z D

     ¡5:

       Here is the geometrical meaning. We are on the plane z D 4x C y: The derivative
     . f = x/y moves x but not y: To stay on the plane, dz is 4dx: The change in f D
     3x C 2y C z is df D 3dx C 0 C dz D 7dx:

     EXAMPLE 7 On the world line x2 C y2 C z2 D t 2 find . f = y/x;z for f D xyzt:

     The subscripts x; z mean that x and z are fixed. The chain rule skips f = x and
      f = z:

        . f = y/x;z D f = y C . f = t/. t= y/ D xzt C .xyz/.y=t/: Why y=t<

     EXAMPLE 8 From the law P V D T; compute the product . P = V /T . V = T /P . T = P /V :

     Any intelligent person cancels V 's, T 's, and P 's to get 1: The right answer is

     ¡1:
         . P = V /T D ¡T =V 2 . V = T /P D 1=P . T = P /V D V:

     The product is ¡T =P V: This is ¡1 not C1! The chain rule is tricky (Problem 42).

     EXAMPLE 9 Implicit differentiation was used in Chapter 4. The chain rule explains it:

becomes more realistic. The question still is: How to locate the maximum and
minimum?

  The answer is in the partial derivatives. When the graph is level, they are zero.
Deriving the equations fx D 0 and fy D 0 is pure mathematics and pure pleasure.
Applying them is the serious part. We watch out for saddle points, and also for a
minimum at a boundary point--this section takes extra time. Remember the steps for
f .x/ in one-variable calculus:

   1. The leading candidates are stationary points (where df =dx D 0).
   2. The other candidates are rough points (no derivative) and endpoints (a or b).
   3. Maximum vs. minimum is decided by the sign of the second derivative.

In two dimensions, a stationary point requires f = x D 0 and f = y D 0: The tan-
gent line becomes a tangent plane. The endpoints a and b are replaced by a boundary
curve. In practice boundaries contain about 40% of the minima and 80% of the work.

  Finally there are three second derivatives fxx; fxy; and fyy : They tell how the
graph bends away from the tangent plane--up at a minimum, down at a maximum,
both ways at a saddle point. This will be determined by comparing .fxx/.fyy/ with
.fxy /2 :

    STATIONARY POINT HORIZONTAL TANGENT ZERO DERIVATIVES

Suppose f has a minimum at the point (x0; y0). This may be an absolute minimum
or only a local minimum. In both cases f .x0; y0/ f .x; y/ near the point. For an
absolute minimum, this inequality holds wherever f is defined. For a local minimum,
the inequality can fail far away from .x0; y0/: The bottom of your foot is an absolute
minimum, the end of your finger is a local minimum. We assume for now that .x0; y0/
is an interior point of the domain of f: At a boundary point, we cannot expect a
horizontal tangent and zero derivatives.

  Main conclusion: At a minimum or maximum (absolute or local) a nonzero
derivative is impossible. The tangent plane would tilt. In some direction f would
decrease. Note that the minimum point is .x0; y0/; and the minimum value is f .x0; y0/:

  13J If derivatives exist at an interior minimum or maximum, they are zero:

            f = x D 0 and f = y D 0 .together this is grad f D 0/: (1)

  For a function f .x; y; z/ of three variables, add the third equation f = z D 0:

The reasoning goes back to the one-variable case. That is because we look along
the lines x D x0 and y D y0: The minimum of f .x; y/ is at the point where the lines
meet. So this is also the minimum along each line separately.

  Moving in the x direction along y D y0; we find f = x D 0: Moving in the y
direction, f = y D 0 at the same point. The slope in every direction is zero. In
other words grad f D 0:

       Graphically, .x0; y0/ is the low point of the surface z D f .x; y/: Both cross sec-
     tions in Figure 13.16 touch bottom. The phrase "if derivatives exist" rules out the
     vertex of a cone, which is a rough point. The absolute value f D x has a minimum
     without df =dx D 0; and so does the distance f D r: The rough point is .0; 0/:

     Fig. 13.16 f = x D 0 and f = y D 0 at the minimum. Quadratic f has linear derivatives.

     EXAMPLE 1 Minimize the quadratic f .x; y/ D x2 C xy C y2 ¡ x ¡ y C 1:

     To locate the minimum (or maximum), set fx D 0 and fy D 0:

                  fx D 2x C y ¡ 1 D 0 and fy D x C 2y ¡ 1 D 0:                                            (2)

     Notice what's important: There are two equations for two unknowns x and y.
                                                                                          1            1
     Since f  is  quadratic,  the  equations  are  linear.   Their  solution  is   x0  D  3  ;  y0  D  3  (the

     stationary point). This is actually a minimum, but to prove that you need to read

     further.
       The constant 1 affects the minimum value f D 23 --but not the minimum point.

     The graph shifts up by 1: The linear terms ¡x ¡ y affect fx and fy : They move the

     minimum away from .0; 0/: The quadratic part x2 C xy C y2 makes the surface curve

     upwards. Without that curving part, a plane has its minimum and maximum at

     boundary points.

     EXAMPLE 2 (Steiner's problem) Find the point that is nearest to three given
     points.

     This example is worth your attention. We are locating an airport close to three cities.

     Or we are choosing a house close to three jobs. The problem is to get as near as

     possible to the corners of a triangle. The best point depends on the meaning of "near."

      The distance to the first corner .x1; y1/ is d1 D .x ¡ x1/2 C .y ¡ y1/2: The

     distances to the other corners .x2; y2/ and .x3; y3/ are d2 and d3: Depending on
     whether cost equals (distance) or .distance/2 or .distance/p, our problem will be:

          Minimize d1 C d2 C d3 or d12 C d22 C d32 or even d1p C d2p C d3p:

     The  second  problem  is  the  easiest,  when  d2    and  d2   and  d2   are  quadratics:

                                                      1          2         3

     Solving  f=  xD0         gives  x  D  1  .x1  C  x2  C  x3/:   Then      f = y D 0 gives y D 13

the nearest point to the corners when the cost is .distance/2: Note how squaring
makes the derivatives linear. Least squares dominates an enormous part of applied
mathematics.

            d1 C d2 C d3:

The real "Steiner problem" is to minimize f .x; y/ D d1 C d2 C d3: We are laying

down roads from the corners, with cost proportional to length. The equations fx D 0

and fy D 0 look complicated because of square roots. But the nearest point in

Figure 13.17b has a remarkable property, which you will appreciate.

Calculus    takes   derivatives  of   d2   D  .x  ¡   x1/2      C  .y  ¡  y1/2:  The     x  derivative  leaves

2d1. d1= x/ D 2.x ¡ x1/: Divide both sides by 2d1:

d1 D x ¡ x1 and              d1 D y ¡ y1  so grad d x 1 D ¡ x1 ; y ¡ y1  : (3)
x           d1               y             d1                                        d1     d1

This  gradient  is  a  unit  vector.  The  sum    of  .x  ¡     x1/2=d12  and    .y  ¡   y1/2=d12  is   d2   =d12  D

                                                                                                          1
1: This was already in Section 13.4: Distance increases with slope 1 away from the

center. The gradient of d1 (call it u1) is a unit vector from the center point .x1; y1/:

  Similarly the gradients of d2 and d3 are unit vectors u2 and u3: They point directly
away from the other corners of the triangle. The total cost is f .x; y/ D d1 C d2 C d3;
so we add the gradients. The equations fx D 0 and fy D 0 combine into the vector

equation

                       grad f D u1 C u2 C u3 D 0 at the minimum:

The three unit vectors add to zero! Moving away from one corner brings us closer
to another. The nearest point to the three corners is where those movements cancel.
This is the meaning of "grad f D 0 at the minimum."

  It is unusual for three unit vectors to add to zero--this can only happen in one

way. The three directions must form angles of 120¥: The best point has this

property, which is repeated in Figure 13.18a. The unit vectors cancel each other. At

the "Steiner point," the roads to the corners make 120¥ angles. This optimal point

solves the problem, except for one more possibility.
584              13 Partial Derivatives

     Fig. 13.18  Gradients u1 C u2 C u3 D 0 for 120¥ angles. Corner wins at wide angle. Four
                 corners. In this case two branchpoints are better--still 120¥:

       The other possibility is a minimum at a rough point. The graph of the distance
     function d1.x; y/ is a cone. It has a sharp point at the center .x1; y1/: All three
     corners of the triangle are rough points for d1 C d2 C d3; so all of them are possible
     minimizers.

       Suppose the angle at a corner exceeds 120¥: Then there is no Steiner point.

     Inside the triangle, the angle would become even wider. The best point must be a
     rough point--one of the corners. The winner is the corner with the wide angle. In the
     figure that means d1 D 0: Then the sum d2 C d3 comes from the two shortest edges.

     Summary The solution is at a 120¥ point or a wide-angle corner. That is the theory.

     The real problem is to compute the Steiner point--which I hope you will do.

     Remark 1 Steiner's problem for four points is surprising. We don't minimize
     d1 C d2 C d3 C d4--there is a better problem. Connect the four points with roads,
     minimizing their total length, and allow the roads to branch. A typical solution is

     in Figure 13.18c. The angles at the branch points are 120¥: There are at most two

     branch points (two less than the number of corners).

     Remark 2 For other powers p; the cost is .d1/p C .d2/p C .d3/p: The x derivative
     is

        f = x D p.d1/p¡2.x ¡ x1/ C p.d2/p¡2.x ¡ x2/ C p.d1/p¡2.x ¡ x3/: (4)

     The key equations are still f = x D 0 and f = y D 0: Solving them requires a
     computer and an algorithm. To share the work fairly, I will supply the algorithm
     (Newton's method) if you supply the computer. Seriously, this is a terrific example.
     It is typical of real problems--we know f = x and f = y but not the point where
     they are zero. You can calculate that nearest point, which changes as p changes. You
     can also discover new mathematics, about how that point moves. I will collect all
     replies I receive to Problems 38 and 39:

                            MINIMUM OR MAXIMUM ON THE BOUNDARY

     Steiner's problem had no boundaries. The roads could go anywhere. But most
     applications have restrictions on x and y; like x 0 or y 0 or x2 C y2 1: The
     minimum with these restrictions is probably higher than the absolute minimum. There
     are three possibilities:

      .1/ stationary point fx D 0; fy D 0 .2/ rough point .3/ boundary point

     That third possibility requires us to maximize or minimize f .x; y/ along the
     boundary.

EXAMPLE 3 Minimize f .x; y/ D x2 C xy C y2 ¡ x ¡ y C 1 in the half-plane x

0:

The minimum in Example 1 was 32 : It occurred at x0 D 13 ; y0 D 31 : This point is still
allowed. It satisfies the restriction x 0: So the minimum is not moved.

EXAMPLE 4 Minimize the same f .x; y/ restricted to the lower half-plane y 0:

Now  the  absolute    minimum   at   .   1  ;  1  /  is  not  allowed.        There         are  no  rough  points.  We
                                         3     3
look for a minimum on the boundary line y D 0 in Figure 13.19a. Set y D 0; so f

depends only on x: Then choose the best x:

          f .x; 0/ D x2 C 0 ¡ x ¡ 0 C 1 and fx D 2x ¡ 1 D 0:

The minimum  is   at  x   D  1  and  y   D 0;        where f    D   43 :   This         is  up  from  32 :
                             2

     Fig. 13.19 The boundaries y D 0 and x2 C y2 D 1 contain the minimum points.

EXAMPLE 5 Minimize the same f .x; y/ on or outside the circle x2 C y2 D 1:

One  possibility  is  fx  D  0  and  fy  D     0:    But  this  is  at  .  1  ;  1  /;  inside   the  circle.  The  other
                                                                           3     3
possibility is a minimum at a boundary point, on the circle.
To follow this boundary we can set y D 1 ¡ x2: The function f gets compli-

cated, and df =dx is worse. There is a way to avoid square roots: Set x D cos t and

y D sin t: Then f D x2 C xy C y2 ¡ x ¡ y C 1 is a function of the angle t :

      f .t/ D1 C cos t sin t ¡ cos t ¡ sin t C 1
     df =dt D cos2 t ¡ sin2 t C sin t ¡ cos t D .cos t ¡ sin t/.cos t C sin t ¡ 1/:

Now df =dt D 0 locates a minimum or maximum along the boundary. The first factor

.cos t ¡ sin t / is zero when x D y: The second factor is zero when cos t C sin t D 1;

or x C y D 1: Those points on the circle are the candidates. Problem 24 sorts them
out, and Section 13.7 finds the minimum in a new way--using "Lagrange multipli-
ers." Minimization on a boundary is a serious problem--it gets difficult quickly--and
multipliers are ultimately the best solution.

                       MAXIMUM VS. MINIMUM VS. SADDLE POINT

How to separate the maximum from the minimum? When possible, try all candidates
and decide. Compute f at every stationary point and other critical point (maybe also
out at infinity), and compare. Calculus offers another approach, based on second
derivatives.
586                                    13 Partial Derivatives

       With one variable the second derivative test was simple: fxx 0 at a minimum,
     fxx D 0 at an inflection point, fxx 0 at a maximum. This is a local test, which may
     not give a global answer. But it decides whether the slope is increasing (bottom of the
     graph) or decreasing (top of the graph). We now find a similar test for f .x; y/:

       The new test involves all three second derivatives. It applies where fx D 0 and
     fy D 0: The tangent plane is horizontal. We ask whether the graph of f goes
     above or below that plane. The tests fxx 0 and fyy 0 guarantee a minimum
     in the x and y directions, but there are other directions.

     EXAMPLE 6 f .x; y/ D x2 C 10xy C y2 has fxx D 2; fxy D 10; fyy D 2 (mini-
     mum or not?)

     All second derivatives are positive--but wait and see. The stationary point is .0; 0/;
     where f = x and f = y are both zero. Our function is the sum of x2 C y2; which
     goes upward, and 10xy which has a saddle. The second derivatives must decide whether
     x2 C y2 or 10xy is stronger.

       Along the x axis, where y D 0 and f D x2; our point is at the bottom. The mini-
     mum in the x direction is at .0; 0/: Similarly for the y direction. But .0; 0/ is not a
     minimum point for the whole function, because of 10xy:

      Try x D 1; y D ¡1: Then f D 1 ¡ 10 C 1; which is negative. The graph goes be-

     low the xy plane in that direction. The stationary point at x D y D 0 is a saddle
     point.

        Fig. 13.20 Minimum, maximum, saddle point based on the signs of a and ac ¡ b2:

     EXAMPLE 7 f .x; y/ D x2 C xy C y2 has fxx D 2; fxy D 1; fyy D 2 (minimum
     or not?)
     The second derivatives 2; 1; 2 are again positive. The graph curves up in the x and
     y directions. But there is a big difference from Example 6: fxy is reduced from 10
     to 1: It is the size of fxy (not its sign!) that makes the difference. The extra

     terms ¡x ¡ y C 4 in Example 1 moved the stationary point to . 13 ; 13 /: The second

     derivatives are still 2; 1; 2; and they pass the test for a minimum:

     13K At .0; 0/ the quadratic function f .x; y/ D ax2 C 2bxy C cy2 has a

                      a0                    a0  saddle point if ac b2:
     minimum if ac b2     maximum if ac b2

     For a direct proof, split f .x; y/ into two parts by "completing the square:"

     ax2 C 2bxy C cy2  D a x C b 2 y C ac ¡ b2 y2:
                          a                     a
                     13.6 Maxima, Minima, and Saddle Points                                                                       587

That algebra can be checked (notice the 2b). It is the conclusion that's important:
     if a 0 and ac b2; both parts are positive: minimum at .0; 0/
     if a 0 and ac b2; both parts are negative: maximum at .0; 0/
     if ac b2; the parts have opposite signs: saddle point at .0; 0/:

Since the test involves the square of b; its sign has no importance. Example 6
                                                                                1
had  bD5   and   a   saddle         point.   Example       7     had      bD    2   and         a   minimum.   Reversing      to
¡x2 ¡ xy ¡ y2 yields a maximum. So does ¡x2 C xy ¡ y2:
Now comes the final step, from ax2 C 2bxy C cy2 to a general function f .x; y/:

For all functions, quadratics or not, it is the second order terms that we test.

EXAMPLE 8 f .x; y/ D ex ¡ x ¡ cos y has a stationary point at x D 0; y D 0:
The first derivatives are ex ¡ 1 and sin y; both zero. The second derivatives are

fxx D ex D 1 and fyy D cos y D 1 and fxy D 0: We only use the derivatives at the
stationary point. The first derivatives are zero, so the second order terms come to the

front in the series for ex ¡ x ¡ cos y:

.1   C  x  C  1  x2  C  ¤  ¤  ¤  /  ¡  x  ¡  .1  ¡  1  y2  C  ¤  ¤  ¤  /  D  1  x2  C        1  y2  C  higher  order  terms:
              2                                     2                        2               2
                                                                                                                      (7)
There is a minimum at the origin. The quadratic part 12 x2 C 12 y2 goes upward. The
x3 and y4 terms are too small to protest. Eventually those terms get large, but near

a stationary point it is the quadratic that counts. We didn't need the whole series,
because from fxx D fyy D 1 and fxy D 0 we knew it would start with 12 x2 C 12 y2:

13L The test in 13K applies to the second derivatives a D fxx; b D fxy; c D fyy
of any f .x; y/ at any stationary point. At all points the test decides whether the

graph is concave up, concave down, or "indefinite."

EXAMPLE 9 f .x; y/ D exy has fx D yexy and fy D xexy: The stationary point
is .0; 0/:

The second derivatives at that point are a D fxx D 0; b D fxy D 1; and c D fyy D 0:
The test b2 ac makes this a saddle point. Look at the infinite series:

                                       exy   D   1  C  xy  C        1  x2y   2  C   ¤  ¤  ¤  :
                                                                    2

No linear term because fx D fy D 0: The origin is a stationary point. No x2 or y2
term (only xy): The stationary point is a saddle point.

 At x D 2; y D ¡2 we find fxxfyy .fxy/2 . The graph is concave up at that

point--but it's not a minimum since the first derivatives are not zero.

  The series begins with the constant term--not important. Then come the linear
terms--extremely important. Those terms are decided by first derivatives, and they
give the tangent plane. It is only at stationary points--when the linear part disap-

pears and the tangent plane is horizontal--that second derivatives take over. Around
any basepoint, these constant-linear-quadratic terms are the start of the Taylor
series.

                                        THE TAYLOR SERIES

We now put together the whole infinite series. It is a "Taylor series"--which means
it is a power series that matches all derivatives of f (at the basepoint). For one
588                                    13 Partial Derivatives

     variable, the powers were xn when the basepoint was 0: For two variables, the pow-
     ers are xn times ym when the basepoint is .0; 0/: Chapter 10 multiplied the nth
     derivative d nf =dxn by xn=nS Now every mixed derivative . = x/n. = y/mf .x; y/
     is computed at the basepoint (subscript 0).

       We multiply those numbers by xnym=nSmS to match each derivative of f .x; y/:

     13M When the basepoint is .0; 0/; the Taylor series is a double sum
      anmxnym: The term anmxnym has the same mixed derivative at .0; 0/

     as f .x; y/: The series is

           f .0; 0/Cx   f   f  x2  2f                                          2f

     The derivatives of this series agree with the derivatives of f .x; y/ at the basepoint.

     The first three terms are the linear approximation to f .x; y/: They give the tangent

     plane at the basepoint. The x2 term has n D 2 and m D 0; so nSmS D 2: The xy
                                                                  1

     This happens to have ac D b2; the special case that was omitted in 13M and 13N. It

     is the two-dimensional version of an inflection point. The second derivatives fail to
     decide the concavity. When fxx fyy D .fxy/2; the decision is passed up to the higher

     derivatives. But in ordinary practice, the Taylor series is stopped after the quadratics.

      If the basepoint moves to .x0; y0/; the powers become .x ¡ x0/n.y ¡ y0/m--and

     all derivatives are computed at this new basepoint.

     Final questionW How would you compute a minimum numerically? One good

     way is to solve fx D 0 and fy D 0: These are the functions g and h of Newton's

     method (Section 13.3). At the current point .xn; yn/; the derivatives of g D fx and

     h D fy give linear equations for the steps x and y: Then the next point xnC1 D

     xn C x; ynC1 D yn C y comes from those steps. The input is .xn; yn/; the output

     is the new point, and the linear equations are

     .gx/x C .gy/y D ¡g.xn; yn/ or .fxx/x C .fxy/y D ¡fx.xn; yn/
     .hx/x C .hy/y D ¡h.xn; yn/                  .fxy/x C .fyy/y D ¡fy.xn; yn/:

                                                                                                            (5)

     When the second derivatives of f are available, use Newton's method.

     When the problem is too complicated to go beyond first derivatives, here is an

     alternative--steepest descent. The goal is to move down the graph of f .x; y/; like

     a boulder rolling down a mountain. The steepest direction at any point is given by

     the gradient, with a minus sign to go down instead of up. So move in the direction

     x D ¡s f = x and y D ¡s f = y:

       The question is: How far to move? Like a boulder, a steep start may not aim directly

     toward the minimum. The stepsize s is monitored, to end the step when the function
                     13.6 Maxima, Minima, and Saddle Points                                                                                 589

f starts upward again (Problem 54). At the end of each step, compute first derivatives
and start again in the new steepest direction.

            13.7 Constraints and Lagrange Multipliers

This section faces up to a practical problem. We often minimize one function f .x; y/
while another function g.x; y/ is fixed. There is a constraint on x and y; given by
g.x; y/ D k: This restricts the material available or the funds available or the energy
available. With this constraint, the problem is to do the best possible .fmax or fmin/:

  At the absolute minimum of f .x; y/; the requirement g.x; y/ D k is probably
violated. In that case the minimum point is not allowed. We cannot use fx D 0 and
fy D 0--those equations don't account for g:

  Step 1 Find equations for the constrained minimum or constrained maxi-
mum. They will involve fx and fy and also gx and gy; which give local information
about f and g: To see the equations, look at two examples.

EXAMPLE 1 Minimize f D x2 C y2 subject to the constraint g D 2x C y D k:

Trial runs  The constraint allows x D 0; y D k; where f         D  k  2    :  Also  (  1  k  ;  0)  satisfies
                                                                                       2
the constraint, and f D 14 k2 is smaller. Also x D y D 31 k gives f D 29 k2 (best so

far).

Idea of solution Look at the level curves of f .x; y/ in Figure 13.21. They are circles
x2 C y2 D c: When c is small, the circles do not touch the line 2x C y D k: There
are no points that satisfy the constraint, when c is too small. Now increase c:

  Eventually the growing circles x2 C y2 D c will just touch the line x C 2y D k:
The point where they touch is the winner. It gives the smallest value of c that can be
achieved on the line. The touching point is .xmin; ymin/; and the value of c is fmin:

  What equation describes that point? When the circle touches the line, they are
tangent. They have the same slope. The perpendiculars to the circle and the line
go in the same direction. That is the key fact, which you see in Figure 13.21a.The
direction perpendicular to f D c is given by grad f D .fx; fy/: The direction per-
pendicular to g D k is given by grad g D .gx; gy/: The key equation says that those
two vectors are parallel. One gradient vector is a multiple of the other gradient vector,
with a multiplier  (called lambda) that is unknown:

13N At the minimum of f .x; y/ subject to g.x; y/ D k; the gradient of f is
parallel to the gradient of g--with an unknown number  as the multiplier:

            grad f D  grad g so f D  g and f D  g : (1)
                                               x           x       y                y

Step 2 There are now three unknowns x; y; : There are also three equations:

             f = x D  g= x is                                      2xD 2
             f = y D  g= y is
            g.x; y/ D k is                                         2yD                                  (2)

                                                                2x C yD k:

In the third equation, substitute 2 for 2x and 21  for y: Then 2x C y equals 25 
                          2
equals  k:  Knowing    D  5  k;  go  back  to  the  first  two  equations  for  x;  y;    and   fmin :

x D  D 2k;           y D 1 D 1k;            f 2 2  1 2 5 min D k C k D k2 D 1 k2:
           5              25                        5           5               25 5
592                                 13 Partial Derivatives

     The winning point .xmin; ymin/ is ( 25 k; 15 k). It minimizes the "distance squared,"
     f D x2 C y2 D 15 k2; from the origin to the line.

     Question What is the meaning of the Lagrange multiplier ?

     Mysterious answer     The derivative of          15 k2  is  2  k;  which  equals     :  The      multiplier
                                                                 5
      is the derivative of fmin with respect to k. Move the line by k; and fmin changes

     by about k: Thus the Lagrange multiplier measures the sensitivity to k:

     Pronounce his name "Lagronge" or better "Lagrongh" as if you are French.

     EXAMPLE 2 Maximize and minimize f D x2 C y2 on the ellipse g D .x ¡ 1/2 C

     4y2 D 4:

     Idea and equations The circles x2 C y2 D c grow until they touch the ellipse. The
     touching point is .xmin; ymin/ and that smallest value of c is fmin: As the circles grow
     they cut through the ellipse. Finally there is a point (xmax; ymax/ where the last circle
     touches. That largest value of c is fmax:

       The minimum and maximum are described by the same rule: the circle is tangent to

     the ellipse (Figure 13.21b). The perpendiculars go in the same direction. Therefore
     .fx; fy/ is a multiple of .gx; gy/; and the unknown multiplier is :

               fx D gx W                                                2x D 2.x ¡ 1/

     Solution  The  second  equation          allows  two    possibilities:  y  D  0  or     D  1  :  Following
     up y D 0; the last equation gives .x ¡ 1/2 D 4: Thus x D 3 or x D ¡1: Then the first       4

     equation gives  D 3=2 or  D 1=2: The values of f are x2 C y2 D 32 C 02 D 9 and
     x2 C y2 D .¡1/2 C 02 D 1:
     Now follow  D 1=4: The first equation yields x D ¡1=3: Then the last equation
     requires y2 D 5=9: Since x2 D 1=9 we find x2 C y2 D 6=9 D 2=3: This is fmin:

     Conclusion The equations (3) have four solutions, at which the circle and ellipse are
     tangent. The four points are .3; 0/; .¡1; 0/; .¡1=3; 5=3/; and .¡1=3; ¡ 5=3/:

     The four values of f  are  9;  1;  3  ;  3  :

     Summary The three equations are fx D gx and fy D gy and g D k: The
     unknowns are x; y; and : There is no absolute system for solving the equations

     (unless they are linear; then use elimination or Cramer's Rule). Often the first two
    13.7 Constraints and Lagrange Multipliers                                           593

equations yield x and y in terms of ; and substituting into g D k gives an equation
for :

  At the minimum, the level curve f .x; y/ D c is tangent to the constraint curve
g.x; y/ D k: If that constraint curve is given parametrically by x.t / and y.t /; then
minimizing f .x.t /; y.t // uses the chain rule:

     df D f dx C f dy D 0 or .grad f / ¤ .tangent to curve/ D 0:

         dt x dt y dt

This is the calculus proof that grad f is perpendicular to the curve. Thus grad f is
parallel to grad g: This means (fx; fy / D .gx; gy).

  We have lost fx D 0 and fy D 0: But a new function L has three zero derivatives:

13O The Lagrange function is L.x; y; / D f .x; y/ ¡ .g.x; y/ ¡ k/: Its three

derivatives are Lx D Ly D L D 0 at the solution:

L D f ¡ g D0  L D f ¡ g D0  L D ¡g C k D 0: (4)
xx     x      yy     y
                            

Note that L=  D 0 automatically produces g D k: The constraint is "built in" to

L: Lagrange has included a term .g ¡ k/; which is destined to be zero--but its

derivatives are absolutely needed in the equations! At the solution, g D k and L D f
and L= k D :

  What is important is fx D gx and fy D gy; coming from Lx D Ly D 0: In words:
The constraint g D k forces dg D gxdx C gydy D 0: This restricts the movements
dx and dy: They must keep to the curve. The equations say that df D fxdx C fydy
is equal to dg: Thus df is zero in the allowed direction--which is the key point.

                  MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM WITH TWO CONSTRAINTS

The whole subject of min(max)imization is called optimization. Its applications to
business decisions make up operations research. The special case of linear functions
is always important--in this part of mathematics it is called linear programming. A
book about those subjects won't fit inside a calculus book, but we can take one more
step--to allow a second constraint.

  The function to minimize or maximize is now f .x; y; z/: The constraints are
g.x; y; z/ D k1 and h.x; y; z/ D k2: The multipliers are 1 and 2: We need at least
three variables x; y; z because two constraints would completely determine x and y:

13P To minimize f .x; y; z/ subject to g.x; y; z/ D k1; and h.x; y; z/ D k2; solve
five equations for x; y; z; 1; 2: Combine g D k1 and h D k2 with

f   g     h   f   g     h   f                  g  h
   D 1 C 2 ;     D 1 C 2 ;     D 1 C 2 :

                                                     (5)

Figure 13.22a shows the geometry behind these equations. For convenience f is
x2 C y2 C z2; so we are minimizing distance (squared). The constraints g D x C y C
z D 9 and h D x C 2y C 3z D 20 are linear--their graphs are planes. The constraints

keep .x; y; z/ on both planes--and therefore on the line where they meet. We are

finding the squared distance from .0; 0; 0/ to a line.
594        13 Partial Derivatives

       What equation do we solve? The level surfaces x2 C y2 C z2 D c are spheres. They
     grow as c increases. The first sphere to touch the line is tangent to it. That touching
     point gives the solution (the smallest c). All three vectors grad f; grad g; grad h are
     perpendicular to the line:

        line tangent to sphere  grad f perpendicular to line
           line in both planes  grad g and grad h perpendicular to line.

     Thus grad f; grad g; grad h are in the same plane--perpendicular to the line. With
     three vectors in a plane, grad f is a combination of grad g and grad h:

           .fx; fy ; fz/ D 1.gx; gy; gz/ C 2.hx; hy ; hz/:                               (6)

     This is the key equation (5). It applies to curved surfaces as well as planes.

     EXAMPLE 3 Minimize x2 C y2 C z2 when x C y C z D 9 and x C 2y C 3z D 20:

     In (Figure 13.22b), the normals to those planes are grad g D .1; 1; 1/ and grad h D
     .1; 2; 3/: The gradient of f D x2 C y2 C z2 is .2x; 2y; 2z/: The equations (5)- (6)
     are

                       2x D 1 C 2; 2y D 1 C 22; 2z D 1 C 32:

     Substitute these x; y; z into the other two equations g D x C y C z D 9 and h D 20:

     1 C 2 C 1 C 22 C 1 C 32 D 9 and 1 C 2 C 2 1 C 22 C 3 1 C 32 D 20:

     After multiplying by 2; these simplify to 31 C 62 D 18 and 61 C 142 D 40: The

     solutions are 1 D 2 and 2 D 2: Now the previous equations give .x; y; z/ D .2; 3; 4/:

                                   INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS

In practice, applications involve inequalities as well as equations. The constraints
might be g k and h 0: The first means: It is not required to use the whole re-
source k; but you cannot use more. The second means: h measures a quantity that
cannot be negative. At the minimum point, the multipliers must satisfy the same
inequalities: 1 0 and 2 0:There are inequalities on the 's when there are
inequalities in the constraints.

  Brief reasoning: With g k the minimum can be on or inside the constraint curve.
Inside the curve, where g k; we are free to move in all directions. The constraint is
not really constraining. This brings back fx D 0 and fy D 0 and  D 0--an ordinary
minimum. On the curve, where g D k constrains the minimum from going lower, we
have  0: We don't know in advance which to expect.

  For 100 constraints gi ki ; there are 100 's. Some 's are zero (when gi ki )
and some are nonzero (when gi D ki ). It is those 2100 possibilities that make
optimization interesting. In linear programming with two variables, the constraints
are x 0; y 0:

EXAMPLE 4 Minimixe f D5x C 6y with g D x C y D 4 and hDx 0 and H Dy
0:

The constraint g D 4 is an equation, h and H yield inequalities. Each has its own
Lagrange multiplier--and the inequalities require 2 0 and 3 0: The derivatives
of f; g; h; H are no problem to compute:

f  g  h         H
   D 1 C 2 C 3     yields 5 D 1 C 2
x  x  x         x

                                      (7)

f  g  h         H  yields 6 D 1 C 3:
   D 1 C 2 C 3
y  y  y         y

Those equations make 3 larger than 2: Therefore 3 0; which means that the
constraint on H must be an equation. (Inequality for the multiplier means equality
for the constraint.) In other words H D y D 0: Then x C y D 4 leads to x D 4: The
solution is at (xmin; ymin/ D .4; 0/; where fmin D 20:

  At this minimum, h D x D 4 is above zero. The multiplier for the constraint
h 0 must be 2 D 0: Then the first equation gives 1 D 5: As always, the mul-
tiplier measures sensitivity. When g D 4 is increased by k; the cost fmin D 20 is
increased by 5k: In economics 1 D 5 is called a shadow price--it is the cost of
increasing the constraint.

  Behind this example is a nice problem in geometry. The constraint curve x C y D 4
is a line. The inequalities x 0 and y 0 leave a piece of that line--from P to Q in
Figure 13.23. The level curves f D 5x C 6y D c move out as c increases, until they
touch the line. The first touching point is Q D .4; 0/; which is the solution. It
is always an endpoint--or a corner of the triangle PQR: It gives the smallest cost
fmin; which is c D 20:

     Multiple Integrals

598                         14.1 Double Integrals

     This chapter shows how to integrate functions of two or more variables. First, a
     double integral is defined as the limit of sums. Second, we find a fast way to com-
     pute it. The key idea is to replace a double integral by two ordinary "single"
     integrals.

       The double integral f .x; y/dy dx starts with f .x; y/dy: For each fixed x we
     integrate with respect to y: The answer depends on x: Now integrate again, this time
     with respect to x: The limits of integration need care and attention! Frequently those
     limits on y and x are the hardest part.

       Why bother with sums and limits in the first place ? Two reasons. There has to be a
     definition and a computation to fall back on, when the single integrals are difficult or
     impossible. And also--this we emphasize--multiple integrals represent more than
     area and volume. Those words and the pictures that go with them are the easiest to
     understand. You can almost see the volume as a "sum of slices" or a "double sum of
     thin sticks." The true applications are mostly to other things, but the central idea is
     always the same: Add up small pieces and take limits.

       We begin with the area of R and the volume of V; by double integrals.

                                                A LIMIT OF SUMS

     The graph of z D f .x; y/ is a curved surface above the xy plane. At the point .x; y/
     in the plane, the height of the surface is z: (The surface is above the xy plane only
     when z is positive. Volumes below the plane come with minus signs, like areas below
     the x axis.) We begin by choosing a positive function--for example z D 1 C x2 C y2:

       The base of our solid is a region R in the xy plane. That region will be chopped
     into small rectangles (sides x and y). When R itself is the rectangle 0 x 1;
     0 y 2; the small pieces fit perfectly. For a triangle or a circle, the rectangles
     miss part of R: But they do fit in the limit, and any region with a piecewise smooth
     boundary will be acceptable.

     Question What is the volume above R and below the graph of z D f .x; y/ ?
     Answer It is a double integral--the integral of f .x; y/ over R: To reach it we
     begin with a sum, as suggested by Figure 14.1.
    14.1 Double Integrals                                                                  599

Fig. 14.1 Base R cut into small pieces A: Solid V cut into thin sticks V D zA:

  For single integrals, the interval OEa; b is divided into short pieces of length x:
For double integrals, R is divided into small rectangles of area A D .x/.y/:
Above the i th rectangle is a "thin stick" with small volume. That volume is the base
area A times the height above it--except that this height z D f .x; y/ varies from
point to point. Therefore we select a point .xi ; yi / in the i th rectangle, and compute
the volume from the height above that point:

                                                                          X
  volume of one stick D f .xi ; yi /A volume of all sticks D f .xi ; yi /A:

This is the crucial step for any integral--to see it as a sum of small pieces.

Now take limits: x 0 and y 0: The height z D f .x; y/ is nearly con-

stant over each rectangle. (We assume that f is a continuous function.) The sum

approaches a limit, which depends only on the base R and the surface above it. The

limit is the volume of the solid, and it is the double integral of f .x; y/ over R:

÷÷

           X
    f .x; y/ dA D lim f .xi ; yi /A:
R y 0 x 0                                                                            (1)

To repeat: The limit is the same for all choices of the rectangles and the points
.xi ; yi /: The rectangles will not fit exactly into R; if that base area is curved. The
heights are not exact, if the surface z D f .x; y/ is also curved. But the errors on the
sides and top, where the pieces don't fit and the heights are wrong, approach zero.
Those errors are the volume of the "icing" around the solid, which gets thinner as
x 0 and y 0: A careful proof takes more space than we are willing to give.
But the properties of the integral need and deserve attention:

1. Linearity: .f C g/dA D f dA C g dA

2. Constant comes outside: cf .x; y/dA D c f .x; y/dA

3. R splits into S and T (not overlapping): f dA D f dA C f dA:

           R                           S               T

In 1 the volume under f C g has two parts. The "thin sticks" of height f C g split
into thin sticks under f and under g: In 2 the whole volume is stretched upward by
c: In 3 the volumes are side by side. As with single integrals, these properties help in
computations.

  By writing dA; we allow shapes other than rectangles. Polar coordinates have an
extra factor r in dA D r dr d: By writing dx dy; we choose rectangular coordinates
and prepare for the splitting that comes now.

             SPLITTING A DOUBLE INTEGRAL INTO TWO SINGLE INTEGRALS

     The double integral f .x; y/dy dx will now be reduced to single integrals in y and
     then x: (Or vice versa. Our first integral could equally well be f .x; y/dx:) Chapter
     8
     described the same idea for solids of revolution. First came the area of a slice, which is
     a single integral. Then came a second integral to add up the slices. For solids formed
     by revolving a curve, all slices are circular disks--now we expect other shapes.

       Figure 14.2 shows a slice of area A.x/: It cuts through the solid at a fixed value of
     x: The cut starts at y D c on one side of R; and ends at y D d on the other side. This
     particular example goes from y D 0 to y D 2 (R is a rectangle). The area of a slice is
     the y integral of f .x; y/: Remember that x is fixed and y goes from c to d :

                                                     ÷d    .the answer is a function of x/:

     This is the reverse of a partial derivative! The integral of x2dy; with x constant, is

     x2y: This "partial integral" is actually called an inner integral. After substituting the
                                                                                                   8

     the outer integral adds slices to find the volume A.x/ dx: The answer is a number:

The inner integrals are the cross-sectional areas A.x/ and a.y/ of the slices. The outer
integrals add up the volumes A.x/dx and a.y/dy: Notice the reversing of limits.

  Normally the brackets in (2) are omitted. When the y integral is first, dy is written
inside dx: The limits on y are inside too. I strongly recommend that you compute
the inner integral on one line and the outer integral on a separate line.

EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume below the plane z D x ¡ 2y and above the base

triangle R:

The triangle R has sides on the x and y axes and the line x C y D 1: The strips in
the y direction have varying lengths. (So do the strips in the x direction.) This is the
main point of the example--the base is not a rectangle. The upper limit on the inner

integral changes as x changes. The top of the triangle is at y D 1 ¡ x:

  Figure 14.3 shows the strips. The region should always be drawn (except for
rectangles). Without a figure the limits are hard to find. A sketch of R makes it easy:

      y goes from c D 0 to d D 1 ¡ x: Then x goes from a D 0 to b D 1:

The inner integral has variable limits and the outer integral has constant limits:

÷ yD1¡x h iyD1 inner: .x ¡ 2y/dy D xy ¡ y2 ¡x D x.1 ¡ x/ ¡ .1 ¡ x/2 D ¡1 C 3x ¡ 2x2

The volume is negative. Most of the solid is below the xy plane. To check the answer

¡ 61 ; do the x integral first: x goes from 0 to 1 ¡ y: Then y goes from 0 to 1:

÷ 1¡y  inner: .x ¡ 2y/dx D 1 x2 ¡ 1¡y 2xy D 1 .1 ¡ y/2 ¡ 2.1 ¡ y/y D 1 ¡ 3y C 5 y2

Same answer, very probably right. The next example computes 1 dx dy D area of R:

                             ÷ 1 ÷ 1¡x                  ÷ 1 ÷ 1¡y

EXAMPLE 3  The area of R is             dy dx and also             dx dy:

                             xD0 yD0                    yD0 xD0

The first has vertical strips. The inner integral equals 1 ¡ x: Then the outer integral
(of 1 ¡ x) has limits 0 and 1; and the area is 21 : It is like an indefinite integral inside

a definite integral.

     Solution Draw a figure! The inner integral goes from the parabola y D x2 up to

     the straight line y D 2x: This gives vertical strips. The strips sit side by side between
     x D 0 and x D 2: They stop where 2x equals x2; and the line meets the parabola.

       The problem is to put the x integral first. It goes along horizontal strips. On each

     line y D constant, we need the entry value of x and the exit value of x: From the
     figure, x goes from 21 y to y: Those are the inner limits. Pay attention also to the
     outer limits, because they now apply to y: The region starts at y D 0 and ends at
     y D 4: No change in the integrand x3--that is the height of the solid:

             ÷ 2 ÷ 2x                                ÷4 ÷ y

This is a new application of double integrals. The total mass is a sum of small masses
( times A) in rectangles of area A: The rectangles don't fit perfectly inside the
semicircle R; and the density is not constant in each rectangle--but those problems
disappear in the limit. We are left with a double integral:

The first inner integral is 12 y2: Substituting the limits gives 21 .1 ¡ x2/: The outer
integral of 21 .1 ¡ x2/ yields the total mass M D 32 :

The second inner integral is xy: Substituting the limits on x gives                           : Then the

outer  integral  is     3  .1     y 2/3=2 :  Substituting  y  D  1   and  y  D  0  yields  M  D  :

Remark This same calculation also produces the moment around the x axis, when
the density is  D 1: The factor y is the distance to the x axis. The moment is

     14.2 Change to Better Coordinates

     You don't go far with double integrals before wanting to change variables. Many
     regions simply do not fit with the x and y axes. Two examples are in Figure 14.5,

     a tilted square and a ring. Those are excellent shapes--in the right coordinates.

     We have to be able to answer basic questions like these:

     ÷÷                    ÷÷                                               ÷

     Find the area dA and moment x dA and moment of inertia Ù

     The problem is: What is dA ? We are leaving the xy variables where dA D dx dy:
       The reason for changing is this: The limits of integration in the y direction are

     miserable. I don't know them and I don't want to know them. For every x we would
     need the entry point P of the line x D constant, and the exit point Q: The heights of
     P and Q are the limits on dy; the inner integral. The geometry of the square and
     ring are totally missed, if we stick rigidly to x and y:

     Fig. 14.5 Unit square turned through angle : Ring with radii 4 and 5:

       Which coordinates are better ? Any sensible person agrees that the area of the tilted
     square is 1: "Just turn it and the area is obvious." But that sensible person may not
     know the moment or the center of gravity or the moment of inertia. So we actually
     have to do the turning.

       The new coordinates u and v are in Figure 14.6a. The limits of integration on v
     are 0 and 1: So are the limits on u: But when you change variables, you don't just
     change limits. Two other changes come with new variables:

     1. The small area dA D dx dy becomes dA D        du dv:
     2. The integral of x becomes the integral of  :

     Substituting u D x in a single integral, we make the same changes. Limits x D 0
     and x D 4 become u D 0 and u D 2: Since x is u2; dx is 2u du: The purpose of

     the change is to find an antiderivative. For double integrals, the usual purpose is to

     improve the limits--but we have to accept the whole package.
       To turn the square, there are formulas connecting x and y to u and v: The geometry

     is clear--rotate axes by --but it has to be converted into algebra:

     u D x cos  C y sin                            x D u cos  ¡ v sin 

     v D ¡x sin  C y cos   and in reverse                                               (1)

                                                   y D u sin  C v cos :

     Figure 14.6 shows the rotation. As points move, the whole square turns. A good way
     to remember equation (1) is to follow the corners as they become .1; 0/ and .0; 1/:
                         14.2 Change to Better Coordinates                                                 607

The change from x dA to                            du dv is partly decided by equation (1). It

gives x as a function of u and v: We also need dA: For a pure rotation the first guess

is correct: The area dx dy equals the area du dv: For most changes of variable

this is false. The general formula for dA comes after the examples.

      Fig. 14.6 Change of coordinates--axes turned by : For rotation dA is du dv:

EXAMPLE 1 Find dA and x dA and x and also x2 dA for the tilted square.

Solution       The area of the square is 0 0 1 1 du dv D 1: Notice the good limits. Then

                                                               2

                    x D x dA              dA D 21 cos  ¡ 21 sin  =1:

Similarly the integral of y leads to y: The answer is no mystery--the point .x; y/ is at

the center of the square! Substituting x D u cos  ¡ v sin  made x dA look worse,

but the limits 0 and 1 are much better.

  The moment of inertia Iy around the y axis is also simplified:

x2 dA D .u cos  ¡ v sin /2 ÷÷ ÷ 1 ÷ 1 du dv D cos2  ¡ cos  sin  C sin2  :
               00                                                 3                2          3

                                                                                                      (3)

You know this next fact but I will write it anyway: The answers don't contain u or

v: Those are dummy variables like x and y: The answers do contain ; because the

square has turned. (The area is fixed at 1:) The moment of inertia Ix D y2 dA is

the same as equation (3) but with all plus signs.

Question       The  sum  Ix  C Iy  simplifies  to  2  (a  constant).  Why     no  dependence  on        ?
                                                   3
Answer Ix C Iy equals I0: This moment of inertia around .0; 0/ is unchanged by

rotation. We are turning the square around one of its corners.

                             CHANGE TO POLAR COORDINATES

The next change is to r and : A small area becomes dA D r dr d (definitely not
dr d ). Area always comes from multiplying two lengths, and d is not a length.
Figure 14.7 shows the crucial region--a "polar rectangle" cut out by rays and circles.
Its area A is found in two ways, both leading to r dr d :
608                                     14 Multiple Integrals

              (Approximate) The straight sides have length r: The circular arcs

              are close to r: The angles are 90¥: So A is close to .r/.r /:

              (Exact) A wedge has area 12 r2: The difference between wedges is
              A:

              A D 1 r C r 2  ¡ 1 r ¡ r 2  D r r :
                              2         2             2            2

     The exact method places r dead center (see figure). The approximation says: Forget
     the change in r as you move outward. Keep only the first-order terms.

       A third method is coming, which requires no picture and no geometry. Calculus
     always has a third method! The change of variables x D r cos ; y D r sin  will go
     into a general formula for dA; and out will come the area r dr d:

           Fig. 14.7 Ring and polar rectangle in xy and r; with stretching factor r D 4:5:

     EXAMPLE 2 Find the area and center of gravity of the ring. Also find x2dA:

     Solution The limits on r are 4 and 5: The limits on  are 0 and 2: Polar coordi-

     nates are perfect for a ring. Compared with limits like x D 25 ¡ y2; the change

     to r dr d is a small price to pay:

                 area D r dr d D 2 2 2 5 h 1 r2 D 5 i5 2 ¡ 42 D 9:
                                 04                      4

     The  integral is 2 (full circle). Actually the ring is a giant polar rectangle. We

     could have used the exact formula r r ; with  D 2 and r D 5 ¡ 4: When

     the radius r is centered at 4:5; the product r r  is .4:5/.1/.2/ D 9 as above.

       Since the ring is symmetric around .0; 0/; the integral of x dA must be zero:

                                   2 5                         h i5 h i2

     Notice r cos  from x--the other r is from dA: The moment of inertia is

     This     integral  is    not  2;   because  the  average  of  cos2   is  1  not  1:
                                                                              2

EXAMPLE 3 Find masses and moments for semicircular plates:  D 1 and

Solution The semicircles in Figure 14.8 have r D 1: The angle goes from 0 to

density :

        1                      1                      1       ¡                        1
                               2                                                       6

        00                                            00

The first mass =2 equals the area (because  D 1). The second mass =6 is smaller

(because  1). Integrating  D 1 is the same as finding a volume when the height is

z D 1 (part of a cylinder). Integrating  D 1 ¡ r is the same as finding a volume when
the height is z D 1 ¡ r (part of a cone). Volumes of cones have the extra factor 31 : The

center of gravity involves the moment Mx D y dA: The distance from the x
axis is y; the mass of a small piece is  dA; integrate to add mass times distance.

Polar coordinates are still best, with y D r sin : Again  D 1 and  D 1 ¡ r:

        1                                2                                 1

The height of the center of gravity is y D Mx=M D moment divided by mass:

Question Compare y for  D 1 and  D other positive constants and  D 1 ¡ r:
Answer Any constant  gives y D4=3: Since 1 ¡ r is dense at r D 0; y drops to

Question How is y D 4=3 related to the "average" of y in the semicircle ?
Answer They are identical. This is the point of y: Divide the integral by the area:

                                                      ÷÷                   ÷÷

The average value of a function is f .x; y/dA                                    dA:              (5)

                                                                                                                              b

The integral of f is divided by the integral of 1 (the area). In one dimension a v.x/ dx

was divided by ab 1 dx (the length b ¡ a). That gave the average value of v.x/ in

     A is the area under a "bell-shaped curve"--see Figure 14.9. This is the most impor-

     tant definite integral in the study of probability. It is difficult because a factor 2x is

     not present. Integrating 2xe¡x2 gives ¡e¡x2 ; but integrating e¡x2 is impossible--

     except approximately by a computer. How can we hope to show that A is exactly
        ? The trick is to go from an area integral A to a volume integral A2: This is

     unusual (and hard to like), but the end justifies the means:

                   ÷          ÷  ¡x2 ¡y2             ÷ 2 ÷

                                                                 e r dr d: (6)

                                                      D0 rD0

     The double integrals cover the whole plane. The r2 comes from x2 C y2; and the

     key factor r appears in polar coordinates. It is now possible to substitute u D r2:
                           1  0 e¡udu D 12 : The  integral is 2: The double integral is
     The  r  integral  is  2

     EXAMPLE 5 Apply Example 4 to the "normal distribution" p.x/ D e¡x2=2= 2:

     Section 8:4 discussed probability. It emphasized the importance of this particular
     p.x/: At that time we could not verify that p.x/dx D 1: Now we can:

                                 1 ÷ ¡x2=2              1  ÷      ¡y2

             x D 2y yields       2 ¡  e dx D            ¡        e dy D 1: (7)

     Question Why include the 2's in p.x/ ? The integral of e¡x2 =  also equals 1:

     Answer With the 2's the "variance" is x2p.x/dx D 1: This is a convenient num-
     ber.

                                  CHANGE TO OTHER COORDINATES

     A third method was promised, to find r dr d without a picture and without geome-
     try. The method works directly from x D r cos  and y D r sin : It also finds the 1
     in du dv; after a rotation of axes. Most important, this new method finds the factor
     J in the area dA D J du dv; for any change of variables. The change is from xy to
     uv:

       For single integrals, the "stretching factor" J between the original dx and the new
     du is (not surprisingly) the ratio dx=du: Where we have dx; we write .dx=du/du:
     Where we have .du=dx/dx; we write du: That was the idea of substitutions--the
     main way to simplify integrals.

       For double integrals the stretching factor appears in the area: dx dy becomes J du dv:
     The old and new variables are related by x D x.u; v/ and y D y.u; v/: The point
     with coordinates u and v comes from the point with coordinates x and y: A whole re-
     gion S; full of points in the uv plane, comes from the region R full of corresponding
     points in the xy plane. A small piece with area J du dv comes from a small piece
     with area dx dy: The formula for J is a two-dimensional version of dx=du:

14B The stretching factor for area is the 2 by 2 Jacobian determinant J.u; v/:

An integral over R in the xy plane becomes an integral over S in the uv plane:
            ÷÷                                ÷÷

                       f .x; y/dx dy D f .x.u; v/; y.u; v// J du dv:                  (9)

                    R                               S

The determinant J is often written .x; y/= .u; v/; as a reminder that this
stretching factor is like dx=du: We require J ¤ 0: That keeps the stretching and
shrinking under control.

  You naturally ask: Why take the absolute value J in equation (9) ? Good
question--it wasn't done for single integrals. The reason is in the limits of integration.

                             ¡1

The single integral 01 dx is 0 .¡du/ after changing x to ¡u: We keep the minus

sign and allow single integrals to run backward. Double integrals could too, but
normally they go left to right and down to up. We use the absolute value J and run
forward.

EXAMPLE 6 Polar coordinates have x D u cos v D r cos  and y D u sin v D r sin :

Why make this simple change, in which a; b; c; d are all constant ? It straightens

parallelograms into squares (and rotates those squares). Figure 14.10 is typical.
  Common sense indicated J D 1 for pure rotation--no change in area. Now J D 1

comes from equations (1) and (11), because ad ¡ bc is cos2  C sin2 :

  In practice, xy rectangles generally go into uv rectangles. The sides can be curved

(as in polar rectangles) but the angles are often 90¥: The change is "orthogonal." The
next example has angles that are not 90¥; and J still gives the answer.

     The square has area 9; the parallelogram has area 3: I don't know if J D 31 is a
     stretching factor or a shrinking factor. The other integral exdx dy is

     Main point: The change to u and v makes the limits easy (just 0 and 3).

       Why is the stretching factor J a determinant ? With straight sides, this goes
     back to Section 11:3 on vectors. The area of a parallelogram is a determinant.
     Here the sides are curved, but that only produces .du/2 and .dv/2; which we ignore.

       A change du gives one side of Figure 14.11--it is . x= u i C y= u j/du: Side
     2 is ( x= v i C y= v j/dv: The curving comes from second derivatives. The area
     (the cross product of the sides) is J du dv:

     Final remark I can't resist looking at the change in the reverse direction. Now the
     rectangle is in xy and the parallelogram is in uv: In all formulas, exchange x for u
     and y for v:

     This is exactly like du=dx D 1=.dx=du/: It is the derivative of the inverse function.
     The product of slopes is 1--stretch out, shrink back. From xy to uv we have 2 by 2
     matrices, and the identity matrix I takes the place of 1:

     dx du D 1                  " x= u               x= v # " u= x                 u= y # "1 0#

                    becomes                                                        v= y

                                                                                                   01

                                                                                                                      (13)

     The first row times the first column is . x= u/. u= x/ C . x= v/. v= x/ D

     x= x D 1: The first row times the second column is . x= u/. u= y/ C . x= v/

     . v= y/ D x= y D 0: The matrices are inverses of each other. The determi-

     nants of a matrix and its inverse obey our rule: old J times new J D 1: Those J 's

     cannot be zero, just as dx=du and du=dx were not zero. (Inverse functions increase

     steadily or decrease steadily.)

     In two dimensions, an area dx dy goes to J du dv and comes back to dx dy:

                        14.3 Triple Integrals

At this point in the book, I feel I can speak to you directly. You can guess what
triple integrals are like. Instead of a small interval or a small rectangle, there is a
small box. Instead of length dx or area dx dy; the box has volume d V D dx dy dz:
That is length times width times height. The goal is to put small boxes together (by
integration). The main problem will be to discover the correct limits on x; y; z:

  We could dream up more and more complicated regions in three-dimensional
space. But I don't think you can see the method clearly without seeing the region
clearly. In practice six shapes are the most important:

               box prism cylinder cone tetrahedron sphere.

The box is easiest and the sphere may be the hardest (but no problem in spherical
coordinates). Circular cylinders and cones fall in the middle, where xyz coordinates
are possible but r z are the best. I start with the box and prism and xyz:

EXAMPLE 1 By triple integrals find the volume of a box and a prism (Figure 14.12).

                132                                  1 3¡3z 2

     dV D               dx dy dz and         dV D                 dx dy dz

box        zD0 yD0 xD0                prism          zD0 yD0 xD0

The inner integral for both is dx D 2: Lines in the x direction have length 2; cutting

through the box and the prism. The middle integrals show the limits on y (since dy

comes second):  2 dy D 6 and 2 dy D 6 3 3¡3z ¡ 6z:

                yD0                   yD0

After two integrations these are areas. The first area 6 is for a plane section through

the box. The second area 6 ¡ 6z is cut through the prism. The shaded rectangle goes
from y D 0 to y D 3 ¡ 3z--we needed and used the equation y C 3z D 3 for the

boundary of the prism. At this point z is still constant! But the area depends on z;

because the prism gets thinner going upwards. The base area is 6 ¡ 6z D 6; the top
area is 6 ¡ 6z D 0:

  The outer integral multiplies those areas by dz; to give the volume of slices. They

are horizontal slices because z came last. Integration adds up the slices to find the

total volume:

                           1  prism volume D .6 1 ¡ 6z/dz D 6z h ¡ 3z2 D 3: i1
                                                                  0
box volume D 6 dz D 6                      zD0

                        zD0

The box volume 2 ¤ 3 ¤ 1 didn't need calculus. The prism is half of the box, so its
volume was sure to be 3--but it is satisfying to see how 6z ¡ 3z2 gives the answer.

Our purpose is to see how a triple integral works.

Question Find the prism volume in the order dz dy dx (six orders are possible).

Answer  ÷ 2 ÷ 3 ÷ .3¡y/=3 ÷ 2 ÷ 3  dz dy dx D 3 ¡ y  ÷ 2 dy dx D 3 dx D 3:
                                             3       02
        000                   00

To find those limits on the z integral, follow a line in the z direction. It enters the

prism at z D 0 and exits at the sloping face y C 3z D 3: That gives the upper limit

z D .3 ¡ y/=3: It is the height of a thin stick as in Section 14:1: This section writes

out dz for the height, but a quicker solution starts at the double integral.

                                2
     a plane x D constant. The outer integral adds up slices.

          f .x; y; z/ d V is computed from three single integrals   f dx dy dz:

     That step cannot be taken in silence--some basic calculus is involved. The triple
                               P

     integral is the limit of fi V; a sum over small boxes of volume V: Here fi is
     any value of f .x; y; z/ in the i th box. (In the limit, the boxes fit a curved region.)
     Now take those boxes in a certain order. Put them into lines in the x direction and
     put the lines of boxes into planes. The lines lead to the inner x integral, whose answer
     depends on y and z: The y integral combines the lines into planes. Finally the outer

     integral accounts for all planes and all boxes.

       Example 2 is important because it displays more possibilities than a box or prism.

     EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of a tetrahedron (4-sided pyramid). Locate (x; y; z).

     Solution A tetrahedron has four flat faces, all triangles. The fourth face in

     Figure 14.13 is on the plane x C y C z D 1: A line in the x direction enters at x D 0

     and exits at x D 1 ¡ y ¡ z: (The length depends on y and z: The equation of the

     boundary plane gives x:) Then those lines are put into plane slices by the y integral:

                        dx dy D                                              y        y        zy  0     D     .1

     yD0 xD0                              yD0

     What  is  this  number  1  .  1  ¡   z  /  2  ?  It  is  the  area  at  height      z:  The   plane  at  that  height
                             2
     slices out a right triangle, whose legs have length 1 ¡ z: The area is correct, but look
     at the limits of integration. If x goes to 1 ¡ y ¡ z; why does y go to 1 ¡ z ? Reason:
     We are assembling lines, not points. The figure shows a line at every y up to 1 ¡ z:

      Adding the slices gives the volume: 0 2 1 1 .1 ¡ z/2dz D 6  1 .z ¡ 1/ 0 31 D 61 : This

     agrees with 31 (base times height), the volume of a pyramid.

     The height z of the centroid is "zaverage:" We compute z d V and divide by

     the volume. Each horizontal slice is multiplied by its height z; and the limits of

     integration don't change:

           ÷÷÷ ÷ 1 ÷ 1¡y ÷ 1¡y¡z ÷ 1 z d V D z dx dy dz D z.1 ¡ z/2 dz D 1 :
                                                                                               2               24

     This is quick because z is constant in the x and y integrals. Each triangular slice

     contributes z times its area 21 .1 ¡ z/2 times dz: Then the z integral gives the moment

For area and volume we meet another pattern. Length of standard interval is 1;
area of standard triangle is 21 ; volume of standard tetrahedron is 61 ; hypervolume in
four dimensions must be                    : The interval reaches the point x D 1; the triangle

reaches the line x C y D1; the tetrahedron reaches the plane x C y C z D1: The four-

dimensional region stops at the hyperplane                          D 1:

EXAMPLE 3 Find the volume                        dx dy dz inside the unit sphere x2 C y2 C z2 D
1:

First question: What are the limits on x ? If a needle goes through the sphere in the

x direction, where does it enter and leave ? Moving in the x direction, the numbers y

and z stay constant. The inner integral deals only with x: The smallest and largest x
are at the boundary where x2 C y2 C z2 D 1: This equation does the work--we solve

it for x: Look at the limits on the x integral:

                                  < < 1¡y2¡z2                       <<          1 ¡ y2 ¡ z2 dy dz: (1)

volume of sphere D                < < ¡ 1¡y2¡z2       dx dy dz D 2

                                                                    <<

The limits on y are ¡ 1 ¡ z2 and C 1 ¡ z2: You can use algebra on the bound-

ary equation x2 C y2 C z2 D 1: But notice that x is gone! We want the smallest and
largest y; for each z: It helps very much to draw the plane at height z; slicing through

the sphere in Figure 14.14. The slice is a circle of radius r D 1 ¡ z2: So the area is

 r2; which must come from the y integral:

                           2 1 ¡ y2 ¡ z2 dy D area of slice D .1 ¡ z2/:                                     (2)

I admit that I didn't integrate. Is it cheating to use the formula  r2 ? I don't think
so. Mathematics is hard enough, and we don't have to work blindfolded. The goal is
618              14 Multiple Integrals

     understanding, and if you know the area then use it. Of course the integral of

      1 ¡ y2 ¡ z2 can be done if necessary--use Section 7:2:

       The triple integral is down to a single integral. We went from one needle to a circle
     of needles and now to a sphere of needles. The volume is a sum of slices of area

     .1 ¡ z2/: The South Pole is at z D ¡1; the North Pole is at z D C1; and the integral

     is the volume 4=3 inside the unit sphere:

     Question 1 A cone also has circular slices. How is the last integral changed ?

     Answer The slices of a cone have radius 1 ¡ z: Integrate .1 ¡ z/2 not 1 ¡ z2:

     Question 2 How does this compare with a circular cylinder (height 1; radius 1) ?
     Answer Now all slices have radius 1: Above z D 0; a cylinder has volume  and a
     half-sphere has volume 32  and a cone has volume 13 :

       For solids with equal surface area, the sphere has largest volume.

14.4 Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates

  Cylindrical coordinates are good for describing solids that are symmetric around
an axis. The solid is three-dimensional, so there are three coordinates r; ; z:

          r: out from the axis  : around the axis z: along the axis.

This is a mixture of polar coordinates r in a plane, plus z upward. You will not find
r z difficult to work with. Start with a cylinder centered on the z axis:

solid cylinder W 0 r 1 flat bottom and top W 0 z 3 half-cylinder W 0  

                                                             3 1

Integration over this half-cylinder is 0 0 0 ? dr d dz. These limits on r; ; z
are especially simple. Two other axially symmetric solids are almost as convenient:

        cone W integrate to r C z D 1 sphere W integrate to r2 C z2 D R2

I would not use cylindrical coordinates for a box. Or a tetrahedron.
  The integral needs one thing more--the volume d V . The movements dr and d

and dz give a "curved box" in xyz space, drawn in Figure 14.15c. The base is a polar
rectangle, with area r dr d . The new part is the height dz. The volume of the
curved box is r dr d dz. Then r goes in the blank space in the triple integral--the
stretching factor is J D r. There are six orders of integration (we give two):

                    ÷÷÷                           ÷÷÷

EXAMPLE 1 (Volume of the half-cylinder). The integral of r dr from 0 to 1 is 21 :
The  integral is  and the z integral is 3. The volume is 3=2.

EXAMPLE 2 The surface r D 1 ¡ z encloses the cone in Figure 14.16. Find its

volume.

First solution Since r goes out to 1 ¡ z, the integral of r dr is 21 .1 ¡ z/2. The 
integral is 2 (a full rotation). Stop there for a moment.
                                     ¡
We have reached  r  dr  d  D  1  .1     z/2  2 .  This  is  the  area  of  a  slice  at  height
z. The slice is a circle, its radius is 1 ¡ z, its area is .1 ¡ z/2. The z integral adds2
622                                           14 Multiple Integrals

     those slices to give =3. That is correct, but it is not the only way to compute the

     volume.

     Second solution Do the z and  integrals first. Since z goes up to 1 ¡ r, and 
     goes around to 2, those integrals produce r dz d D r.1 ¡ r/2. Stop again--

     this must be the area of something.

      After the z and  integrals we have a shell at radius r. The height is 1 ¡ r (the

     outer shells are shorter). This height times 2 r gives the area around the shell. The
     choice between shells and slices is exactly as in Chapter 8: Different orders of inte-

     gration give different ways to cut up the solid.
       The volume of the shell is area times thickness dr. The volume of the complete

     cone is the integral of shell volumes: 01r.1 ¡ r/2 dr D =3.

     Third solution Do the r and z integrals first: r dr dz D 61 . Then the  integral
         1                           1                                                                        1
     is  6    d,  which       gives  6  times     2 .  This   is  the  volume     =3--but          what   is  6   d   ?

         The  third  cone     is  cut   into  wedges.    The      volume    of    a  wedge         is  1  d.  It  is  quite
                                                                                                       6
     common to do the  integral last, especially when it just multiplies by 2. It is not so

     common to think of wedges.

     Question        Is  the  volume    1   d     equal  to   an  area  1   times    a  thickness      d  ?

     Answer       No!    The      triangle    in  the  third  cone     has  area  2     not        Thickness      is  never

     d.

        Fig. 14.16 A cone cut three ways: slice at height z, shell at radius r, wedge at angle .

       This cone is typical of a solid of revolution. The axis is in the z direction. The
      integral yields 2, whether it comes first, second, or third. The r integral goes

     out to a radius f .z/, which is 1 for the cylinder and 1 ¡ z for the cone. The in-

     tegral r dr d is .f .z//2 D area of circular slice. This leaves the z integral
       .f .z//2dz. That is our old volume formula .f .x//2dx from Chapter 8; where

     the slices were cut through the x axis.

     EXAMPLE 3 The moment of inertia around the z axis is r3dr d dz. The
     extra r2 is .distance to axis/2. For the cone this triple integral is =10.

     EXAMPLE 4 The moment around the z axis is r2 dr d dz. For the cone
     this is =6. The average distance r is .moment/=.volume/ D .=6/=.=3/ D 21 .

     EXAMPLE 5 A sphere of radius R has the boundary r2 C z2 D R2, in cylindrical

     coordinates. The outer limit on the r integral is R2 ¡ z2. That is not acceptable in

difficult problems. To avoid it we now change to coordinates that are natural for a
sphere.

SPHERICAL COORDINATES

The Earth is a solid sphere (or near enough). On its surface we use two coordinates--
latitude and longitude. To dig inward or fly outward, there is a third coordinate--the
distance  from the center. This Greek letter rho replaces r to avoid confusion with
cylindrical coordinates. Where r is measured from the z axis,  is measured from the
origin. Thus r2 D x2 C y2 and 2 D x2 C y2 C z2.

  The angle  is the same as before. It goes from 0 to 2. It is the longitude, which

increases as you travel east around the Equator.
  The angle  is new. It equals 0 at the North Pole and  (not 2) at the South Pole.

It is the polar angle, measured down from the z axis. The Equator has a latitude of 0
but a polar angle of =2 (halfway down). Here are some typical shapes:

solid sphere (or ball): 0  R  surface of sphere:  D R

upper half-sphere: 0  =2 eastern half-sphere: 0  

Fig. 14.17 Spherical coordinates . The volume dV D 2 sin  d d d of a spherical
                box.

The angle  is constant on a cone from the origin. It cuts the surface in a circle
(Figure 14.17b), but not a great circle. The angle  is constant along a half-circle

from pole to pole. The distance  is constant on each inner sphere, starting at the
center  D 0 and moving out to  D R.

  In spherical coordinates the volume integral is 2 sin  d d d . To
explain that surprising factor J D 2 sin , start with x D r cos  and y D r sin  . In
spherical coordinates r is  sin  and z is  cos --see the triangle in the figure. So

substitute  sin  for r:

x D  sin  cos ; y D  sin  sin ; z D  cos :                    (1)

Remember those two steps,  to r z to xyz. We check that x2 C y2 C z2 D 2:

2.sin2  cos2  C sin2  sin2  C cos2 / D 2.sin2  C cos2 / D 2:

  The volume integral is explained by Figure 14.17c. That shows a "spherical box"
with right angles and curved edges. Two edges are d and d. The third edge is
horizontal. The usual rd becomes  sin  d: Multiplying those lengths gives d V .
624                                           14 Multiple Integrals

     The volume of the box is d V D 2 sin  d d d . This is a distance cubed, from
     2d.

     After those examples from geometry, here is the real thing from science. I want
     to compute one of the most important triple integrals in physics--"the gravitational
     attraction of a solid sphere." For some reason Isaac Newton had trouble with this
     integral. He refused to publish his masterpiece on astronomy until he had solved it. I
     think he didn't use spherical coordinates--and the integral is not easy even now.

       The answer that Newton finally found is beautiful. The sphere acts as if all its
     mass were concentrated at the center. At an outside point .0; 0; D/, the force of
     gravity is proportional to 1=D2. The force from a uniform solid sphere equals the
     force from a point mass, at every outside point P . That is exactly what Newton wanted
     and needed, to explain the solar system and to prove Kepler's laws.

       Here is the difficulty. Some parts of the sphere are closer than D, some parts are
     farther away. The actual distance q, from the outside point P to a typical inside point,
     is shown in Figure 14.18. The average distance q to all points in the sphere is not
     D. But what Newton needed was a different average, and by good luck or some
     divine calculus it works perfectly: The average of 1=q is 1=D. This gives the
     potential energy:

                       potential at point P D 1 d V D Volume of sphere : (2)
                                                        sphere q                    D

     A small volume d V at the distance q contributes d V =q to the potential (Section 8:6;

     with density 1). The integral adds the contributions from the whole sphere.

     Equation (2) says that the potential at r D D is not changed when the sphere is

     squeezed to the center. The potential equals the whole volume divided by the single

     distance D.

        Important      point:  The         average  of  1=q  is  1=D  and   not  1=q.  The  average  of  1  and
                                                                                                         2

     4  is  not        Smaller  point:     I  wrote     "sphere"  where  I  should  have  written  "ball."  The

     sphere is solid: 0  R; 0  ; 0  2. What about the force ? For the

     small volume it is proportional to d V =q2 (this is the inverse square law). But force is

     a vector, pulling the outside point toward d V --not toward the center of the sphere.

     The figure shows the geometry and the symmetry. We want the z component of the

     force. (By symmetry the overall x and y components are zero.) The angle between

     the force vector and the z axis is , so for the z component we multiply by cos .

     The total force comes from the integral that Newton discovered:

I will compute the integral (2) and leave you the privilege of solving (3). I mean that
word seriously. If you have come this far, you deserve the pleasure of doing what at
one time only Isaac Newton could do. Problem 26 offers a suggestion (just the law of
cosines) but the integral is yours.

Fig. 14.18 Distance q from outside point to inside point. Distances q and Q to surface.

  The law of cosines also helps with (2). For the triangle in the figure it gives

q2 D D2 ¡ 2D cos  C 2. Call this whole quantity u. We do the surface integral

first .d and d with  fixed/. Then q2 D u and q D u and du D 2D sin  d:

÷ 2 ÷  2 sin  d d ÷ 22 du  2 D

2 came from the  integral. The integral of du= u is 2 u. Since cos  D ¡1

at the upper limit, u is D2 C 2D C 2. The square root of u is D C . At the

lower limit cos  D C1 and u D D2 ¡ 2D C 2. This is another perfect square--
its square root is D ¡ . The surface integral (4) with fixed  is

÷ ÷ dA D 2 .D C / ¡ .D ¡ / D 42 : (5)
    qD                                   D

Last comes the  integral: 0R42d=D D 43 R3=D. This proves formula (2):
potential equals volume of the sphere divided by D.

Note 1 Physicists are also happy about equation (5). The average of 1=q is 1=D
not only over the solid sphere but over each spherical shell of area 42. The shells

can have different densities, as they do in the Earth, and still Newton is correct. This
also applies to the force integral (3)--each separate shell acts as if its mass were
concentrated at the center. Then the final  integral yields this property for the solid

sphere.

Note 2 Physicists also know that force is minus the derivative of potential. The
derivative of (2) with respect to D produces the force integral (3). Problem 27 ex-
plains this shortcut to Equation (3).
626                                     14 Multiple Integrals

     EXAMPLE 8 Everywhere inside a hollow sphere the force of gravity is zero.

     When D is smaller than , the lower limit u in the integral (4) changes from D ¡ 
     to  ¡ D. That way the square root stays positive. This changes the answer in (5) to

     42=, so the potential no longer depends on D. The potential is constant inside
     the hollow shell. Since the force comes from its derivative, the force is zero.

       A more intuitive proof is in the second figure. The infinitesimal areas on the surface
     are proportional to q2 and Q2. But the distances to those areas are q and Q, so the
     forces involve 1=q2 and 1=Q2 (the inverse square law). Therefore the two areas exert
     equal and opposite forces on the inside point, and they cancel each other. The total
     force from the shell is zero.

       I believe this zero integral is the reason that the inside of a car is safe from lightning.
     Of course a car is not a sphere. But electric charge distributes itself to keep the surface
     at constant potential. The potential stays constant inside--therefore no force. The tires
     help to prevent conduction of current (and electrocution of driver).

       P.S. Don't just step out of the car. Let a metal chain conduct the charge to the
     ground. Otherwise you could be the conductor.

                   CHANGE OF COORDINATES--STRETCHING FACTOR J

     Once more we look to calculus for a formula. We need the volume of a small curved
     box in any uvw coordinate system. The r z box and the  box have right
     angles, and their volumes were read off from the geometry (stretching factors J D r
     and J D 2 sin  in Figures 14.15 and 14.17). Now we change from xyz to other
     coordinates uvw--which are chosen to fit the problem.

       Going from xy to uv, the area dA D J du dv was a 2 by 2 determinant. In three
     dimensions the determinant is 3 by 3. The matrix is always the "Jacobian matrix,"
     containing first derivatives. There were four derivatives from xy to uv, now there are
     nine from xyz to uvw.

     14C Suppose x; y; z are given in terms of u; v; w. Then a small box in uvw space
     (sides du, dv, dw) comes from a volume d V D J du dv dw in xyz space:

     The volume integral  dx dy dz becomes   J du dv dw, with limits on
     uvw.

     Remember that a 3 by 3 determinant is the sum of six terms (Section 11:5). One
     term in J is . x= u/. y= v/. z= w/, along the main diagonal. This comes from
     pure stretching, and the other five terms allow for rotation. The best way to exhibit
     the formula is for spherical coordinates--where the nine derivatives are easy but the
     determinant is not:

The determinant has six terms, but two are zero--because of the zero in the
corner. The other four terms are 2 sin  cos2  sin2  and 2 sin  cos2  cos2 
and 2 sin3  sin2  and 2 sin3  cos2  . Add the first two (note sin2  C cos2  )
and separately add the second two. Then add the sums to reach J D 2 sin .

  Geometry already gave this answer. For most uvw variables, use the determinant.

                             CHAPTER 15

           Vector Calculus

Chapter 14 introduced double and triple integrals. We went from dx to dx dy
and dx dy dz. All those integrals add up small pieces, and the limit gives area or
volume or mass. What could be more natural than that? I regret to say, after the success
of those multiple integrals, that something is missing. It is even more regrettable that
we didn't notice it. The missing piece is nothing less than the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus.

  The double integral dx dy equals the area. To compute it, we did not use an
antiderivative of 1: At least not consciously. The method was almost trial and error,
and the hard part was to find the limits of integration. This chapter goes deeper, to
show how the step from a double integral to a single integral is really a new form of
the Fundamental Theorem--when it is done right.

  Two new ideas are needed early, one pleasant and one not. You will like vector
fields. You may not think so highly of line integrals. Those are ordinary single
integrals like v.x/dx; but they go along curves instead of straight lines. The nice
step dx becomes the confusing step ds: Where dx equals the length of the interval,

  ds is the length of the curve. The point is that regions are enclosed by curves, and
we have to integrate along them. The Fundamental Theorem in its two-dimensional
form (Green's Theorem) connects a double integral over the region to a single
integral along its boundary curve.

  The great applications are in science and engineering, where vector fields are so
natural. But there are changes in the language. Instead of an antiderivative, we speak
about a potential function. Instead of the derivative, we take the "divergence" and
"curl." Instead of area, we compute flux and circulation and work. Examples come
first.

                                                                                      629

                 15.1 Vector Fields

     For an ordinary scalar function, the input is a number x and the output is a number
     f .x/: For a vector field (or vector function), the input is a point .x; y/ and the output
     is a two-dimensional vector F.x; y/: There is a "field" of vectors, one at every point.
     In three dimensions the input point is .x; y; z/ and the output vector F has three
     components.

     DEFINITION Let R be a region in the xy plane. A vector field F assigns to every
     point .x; y/ in R a vector F.x; y/ with two components:

           F.x; y/ D M.x; y/i C N.x; y/j:                                                 (1)

     This plane vector field involves two functions of two variables. They are the
     components M and N; which vary from point to point. A vector has fixed
     components, a vector field has varying components.

       A three-dimensional vector field has components M.x; y; z/ and N.x; y; z/ and
     P .x; y; z/: Then the vectors are F D M i C N j C P k:

     EXAMPLE 1 The position vector at .x; y/ is R D xi C yj: Its components are
     M D x and N D y: The vectors grow larger as we leave the origin (Figure 15.1a).
     Their direction is outward and their length is R D x2 C y2 D r: The vector R
     is boldface, the number r is lightface.

     EXAMPLE 2 The vector field R=r consists of unit vectors ur ; pointing outward.
     We divide R D xi C yj by its length, at every point except the origin. The components
     of R=r are M D x=r and N D y=r: Figure 15.1 shows a third field R=r2; whose
     length is 1=r:

     Fig. 15.1 The vector fields R and R=r and R=r2 are radial. Lengths r and 1 and 1=r:

     EXAMPLE 3 The spin field or rotation field or turning field goes around the origin

     instead of away from it. The field is S: Its components are M D ¡y and N D x:

     S D ¡yi C xj also has length S D .¡y/2 C x2 D r:                                     (2)

     S is perpendicular to R--their dot product is zero: S ¤ R D .¡y/.x/ C .x/.y/ D 0:

     The spin fields S=r and S=r2 have lengths 1 and 1=r:

     The unit vector S=r is u : Notice the blank at .0; 0/; where this field is not defined.

Fig. 15.2 The spin fields S and S=r and S=r2 go around the origin. Lengths r and 1 and 1=r:

EXAMPLE 4 A gradient field starts with an ordinary function f .x; y/: The
components M and N are the partial derivatives f = x and f = y: Then the field F
is the gradient of f :

F D grad f D rf D f = x i C f = y j:                                        (3)

This vector field grad f is everywhere perpendicular to the level curves f .x; y/ D
c:
The length grad f tells how fast f is changing (in the direction it changes fastest).
Invent a function like f D x2y; and you immediately have its gradient field
F D 2xyi C x2j: To repeat, M is f = x and N is f = y:

  For every vector field you should ask two questions: Is it a gradient field? If so,
what is f ? Here are answers for the radial fields and spin fields:

15A The radial fields R and R=r and R=r2 are all gradient fields.
      The spin fields S and S=r are not gradients of any f .x; y/:

     The spin field S=r2 is the gradient of the polar angle  D tan¡1.y=x/:

The derivatives of f D 12 .x2 C y2/ are x and y: Thus R is a gradient field. The
gradient of f D r is the unit vector R=r pointing outwards. Both fields are
perpendicular to circles around the origin. Those are the level curves of f D 12 r2
and f D r:

Question Is every R=rn a gradient field?
Answer Yes. But among the spin fields, the only gradient is S=r2:

A major goal of this chapter is to recognize gradient fields by a simple test. The
rejection of S and S=r will be interesting. For some reason ¡yi C xj is rejected and
yi C xj is accepted. (It is the gradient of  :) The acceptance of S=r2 as the

gradient of f D  contains a surprise at the origin (Section 15.3).

Gradient fields are called conservative. The function f is the potential function.

These words, and the next examples, come from physics and engineering.

EXAMPLE 5 The velocity field is V and the flow field is V:

Suppose fluid moves steadily down a pipe. Or a river flows smoothly (no waterfall).
Or the air circulates in a fixed pattern. The velocity can be different at different points,
but there is no change with time. The velocity vector V gives the direction of flow
and speed of flow at every point.
632                                          15 Vector Calculus

     In reality the velocity field is V.x; y; z/; with three components M; N; P: Those

     are the velocities v1; v2; v3 in the x; y; z directions. The speed V is the length:
        2     v2      v2      v2
     V     D       C       C       :  In  a  "plane  flow"  the  k  component  is  zero,  and  the  velocity
                1       2       3
     field is v1i C v2j D M i C N j:

                         Fig. 15.3 A steady velocity field V and two force fields F:

       For a compact disc or a turning wheel, V is a spin field (V D !S, ! D angular ve-
     locity). A tornado might be closer to V D S=r2 (except for a dead spot at the center).
     An explosion could have V D R=r2: A quieter example is flow in and out of a lake
     with steady rain as a source term.

       The flow field V is the density  times the velocity field. While V gives the rate
     of movement, V gives the rate of movement of mass. A greater density means a
     greater rate V of "mass transport." It is like the number of passengers on a bus
     times the speed of the bus.

     EXAMPLE 6 Force fields from gravity: F is downward in the classroom, F is radial
     in space.

     When gravity pulls downward, it has only one nonzero component: F D ¡mgk:

     This assumes that vectors to the center of the Earth are parallel--almost true in a

     classroom. Then F is the gradient of ¡mgz (note f = z D ¡mg).
     In physics the usual potential is not ¡mgz but Cmgz: The force field is mi-

     nus grad f also in electrical engineering. Electrons flow from high potential to low
     potential. The mathematics is the same, but the sign is reversed.

      In space, the force is radial inwards: F D ¡mM GR=r3: Its magnitude is

     proportional to 1=r2 (Newton's inverse square law). The masses are m and M; and the

     gravitational constant is G D 6:672 ¢ 10¡11--with distance in meters, mass in kilo-

     grams, and time in seconds. The dimensions of G are .force/.distance/2=.mass/2:
     This is different from the acceleration g D 9:8m=sec2; which already accounts
     for the mass and radius of the Earth.

       Like all radial fields, gravity is a gradient field. It comes from a potential f :

     f D mM G r and fx D ¡ r3 mM Gx and fy D ¡ r3 mM Gy and fz D ¡ r3 mM Gz :

                                                                                                   (4)

     EXAMPLE 7 (a short example) Current in a wire produces a magnetic field B: It
     is the spin field S=r2 around the wire, times the strength of the current.

                                 STREAMLINES AND LINES OF FORCE

     Drawing a vector field is not always easy. Even the spin field looks messy when the
     vectors are too long (they go in circles and fall across each other). The circles give
            15.1 Vector Fields                                                                   633

a clearer picture than the vectors. In any field, the vectors are tangent to "field
lines"-- which in the spin case are circles.

DEFINITION C is a field line or integral curve if the vectors F.x; y/ are tangent

to C: The slope dy=dx of the curve C equals the slope N=M of the vector F D

M i C N j:

                                !

            dy D N.x; y/ D ¡ x for the spin field : (6)
            dx M.x; y/  y

  We are still drawing the field of vectors, but now they are infinitesimally short.

They are connected into curves! What is lost is their length, because S and S=r and
S=r2 all have the same field lines (circles). For the position field R and gravity field
R=r3; the field lines are rays from the origin. In this case the "curves" are actually

straight.

EXAMPLE 8 Show that the field lines for the velocity field V D yi C xj are
hyperbolas.

dy D N D x  y dy D x dx    12 y2 ¡ 12 x2 D constant:
dx M y

Fig. 15.4 Velocity fields are tangent to streamlines. Gradient fields also have equipotentials.

At every point these hyperbolas line up with the velocity V: Each particle of fluid
travels on a field line. In fluid flow those hyperbolas are called streamlines. Drop a
leaf into a river, and it follows a streamline. Figure 15.4 shows the streamlines for a
river going around a bend.

  Don't forget the essential question about each vector field. Is it a gradient field?
For V D yi C xj the answer is yes, and the potential is f D xy:

            the gradient of xy is . f = x/i C . f = y/j D yi C xj:             (7)

When there is a potential, it has level curves. They connect points of equal potential,
so the curves f .x; y/ D c are called equipotentials. Here they are the curves xy D
c-- also hyperbolas. Since gradients are perpendicular to level curves, the stream-
lines are perpendicular to the equipotentials. Figure 15.4 is sliced one way by
streamlines and the other way by equipotentials.

A gradient field F D f = x i C f = y j is tangent to the field lines (stream-
lines) and perpendicular to the equipotentials (level curves of f ).
634                                      15 Vector Calculus

     In the gradient direction f changes fastest. In the level direction f doesn't change at
     all. The chain rule along f .x; y/ D c proves these directions to be perpendicular:

           f dx C f dy D 0 or .grad f / ¤ .tangent to level curve/ D 0:

                x dt y dt

     EXAMPLE 9 The streamlines of S=r2 are circles around (0; 0). The equipotentials
     are rays  D c: Add rays to Figure 15.2 for the gradient field S=r2:

     For the gravity field those are reversed. A body is pulled in along the field lines (rays).
     The equipotentials are the circles where f D 1=r is constant. The plane is crisscrossed
     by "orthogonal trajectories"--curves that meet everywhere at right angles.

       If you bring a magnet near a pile of iron filings, a little shake will display the field
     lines. In a force field, they are "lines of force." Here are the other new words.

                 15.2 Line Integrals

     A line integral is an integral along a curve. It can equal an area, but that is a special

     case and not typical. Instead of area, here are two important line integrals in physics

     and engineering:                                                                                   ÷

                                                       ÷  Flow across a curveD F ¤ n ds.
                                                                                                     c
      Work along a curveD F ¤ T ds
                                                   c

     In the first integral, F is a force field. In the second integral, F is a flow field. Work

     is done in the direction of movement, so we integrate F ¤ T. Flow is measured through
     the curve C , so we integrate F ¤ n. Here T is the unit tangent vector, and F ¤ T is the

     force component along the curve. Similarly n is the unit normal vector, at right angles

     with T. Then F ¤ n is the component of flow perpendicular to the curve.

       We will write those integrals in several forms. They may never be as comfortable

     as y.x/dx, but eventually we get them under control. I mention these applications

     early, so you can see where we are going. This section concentrates on work, and flow
     comes later. (It is also called flux--the Latin word for flow.) You recognize ds as the
     step along the curve, corresponding to dx on the x axis. Where dx gives the length

     of an interval (it equals b ¡ a), ds is the length of the curve.

     EXAMPLE 1 Flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles on a straight line and a semicircle.

     According to Delta Airlines, the distance straight west is 2000 miles. Atlanta is at

     .1000; 0/ and Los Angeles is at .¡1000; 0/, with the origin halfway between. The

     semicircle route C has radius 1000. This is not a great circle route. It is more of a

     "flat circle," which goes north past Chicago. No plane could fly it (it probably goes

     into space).
       The equation for the semicircle is x2 C y2 D 10002. Parametrically this path is

     x D 1000 cos t; y D 1000 sin t . For a line integral the parameter is better. The plane
     leaves Atlanta at t D 0 and reaches L.A. at t D , more than three hours later. On
     the straight 2000-mile path, Delta could almost do it. Around the semicircle C , the
     distance is 1000 miles and the speed has to be 1000 miles per hour. Remember that
     speed is distance ds divided by time dt :

     ds=dt D .dx=dt/2 C .dy=dt/2 D 1000 .¡ sin t/2 C .¡ cos t/2 D 1000:

                                                                                                   (1)

     The tangent vector to C is proportional to (dx=dt; dy=dt / D .¡1000 sin t; 1000 cos t ).

     But T is a unit vector, so we divide by 1000--which is the speed.

       Suppose the wind blows due east with force F D M i. The components are M and

     zero. For M =constant, compute the dot product F ¤ T and the work -2000 M :

           F ¤ T D M i ¤ .¡ sin t i C cos t j D M.¡ sin t/ C 0.cos t/ D ¡M sin t

     ÷     ÷     ! ds ÷ 

           F ¤ T ds D .¡M sin t/ dt D ¡ 1000M sin t dt D ¡2000M:
        c  t D0  dt                                       0

     Work is force times distance moved. It is negative, because the wind acts against the
     movement. You may point out that the work could have been found more simply--go
     2000 miles and multiply by -M . I would object that this straight route is a different
     path. But you claim that the path doesn't matter--the work of the wind is -2000M
     on every path. I concede that this time you are right (but not always).

       Most line integrals depend on the path. Those that don't are crucially important.
     For a gradient field, we only need to know the starting point P and the finish Q.
      15.2 Line Integrals                                                                637

15B When F is the gradient of a potential function f .x; y/, the work c F ¤ T ds

depends only on the endpoints P and Q. The work is the change in f :

                                  ÷

   If F D f = x i C f = y j then     F ¤ T ds D f .Q/ ¡ f .P /: (2)

                                     c

When F D M i, its components M and zero are the partial derivatives of f D M x.

To compute the line integral, just evaluate f at the endpoints. Atlanta has x D 1000,

Los Angeles has x D ¡1000, and the potential function f D M x is like an

antiderivative:

   work D f .Q/ ¡ f .P / D M.¡1000/ ¡M.1000/ D ¡2000M:              (3)

Fig. 15.5 Force M i, work -2000M on all paths. Force Myi, no work on straight path.

 May I give a rough explanation of the work integral F ¤ T ds? It becomes clearer

when the small movement T ds is written as dx i C dy j. The work is the dot product
with F:

          !

   F ¤ T ds D f i C f j ¤ .dx i C dy j/ D f dx C f dy D df: (4)
      xy                                x  y

The infinitesimal work is df . The total work is df D f .Q/ ¡ f .P /. This is the

Fundamental Theorem for a line integral. Only one warning: When F is not the

gradient of any f (Example 2), the Theorem does not apply.

EXAMPLE 2 Fly these paths against the non-constant force field F D Myi.
Compute the work.

There is no force on the straight path where y D 0. Along the x axis the wind does
no work. But the semicircle goes up where y D 1000 sin t and the wind is strong:

   F ¤ T .Myi/ ¤ .¡ sin t i C cos t j/ D ¡My sin t D ¡1000M sin2 t

F ¤ T ds D .¡1000M sin2 ÷ ÷  t / ds dt D ¡ 106M sin2 ÷  t dt D ¡  106M:
             dt                               2
c  0                                 0

This work is enormous (and unrealistic). But the calculations make an important point--
everything is converted to the parameter t . The second point is that F D Myi is not
a gradient field. First reason: The work was zero on the straight path and nonzero
on the semicircle. Second reason: No function has f = x D My and f = y D 0.
(The first makes f depend on y and the second forbids it. This F is called a shear
force.) Without a potential we cannot substitute P and Q--and the work depends on
the path.
638                  15 Vector Calculus

                                 THE DEFINITION OF LINE INTEGRALS

     We go back to the start, to define F ¤ T ds. We can think of F ¤ T as a function

     g.x; y/ along the path, and define its integral as a limit of sums:

     ÷                            N

           g.x; y/ ds D limit ofX       g.xi ; yi /si as .s/max 0:

                                                                        (5)

        c                         i D1

     The points .xi ; yi / lie on the curve C . The last point Q is (xN ; yN ); the first point
     P is .x0; y0/. The step si is the distance to (xi ; yi ) from the previous point. As the
     steps get small .s 0/ the straight pieces follow the curve. Exactly as in Section
     8:2, the special case g D 1 gives the arc length. As long as g.x; y/ is piecewise con-

     tinuous (jumps allowed) and the path is piecewise smooth (corners allowed), the limit

     exists and defines the line integral.

      When g is the density of a wire, the line integral is the total mass. When g is F ¤ T,

     the integral is the work. But nobody does the calculation by formula (5). We now
     introduce a parameter t --which could be the time, or the arc length s, or the distance
     x along the base.

       The differential ds becomes .ds=dt /dt . Everything changes over to t :

     ÷               ÷ t Db

        g.x; y/ds D          g.x.t /; y.t // .dx=dt /2 C .dy=dt /2 dt:  (6)

                     t Da

     The curve starts when t D a, runs through the points .x.t /; y.t //, and ends when

     t D b. The square root in the integral is the speed ds=dt . In three dimensions the
     points on C are .x.t /; y.t /; z.t // and .dz=dt /2 is in the square root.

     EXAMPLE 3 The points on a coil spring are .x; y; z/ D .cos t; sin t; t /. Find the
     mass of two complete turns (from t D 0 to t D 4) if the density is  D 4.

     Solution The key is .dx=dt /2 C .dy=dt /2 C .dz=dt /2 D sin2 t C cos2 t C 1 D
     2.
     Thus ds=dt D 2. To find the mass, integrate the mass per unit length which is
     g D  D 4:

                     ÷ 4 ds             ÷ 4

           mass D  dt D 4 2 dt D 16 2 .
                     0 dt
                                        0

       That is a line integral in three-dimensional space. It shows how to introduce t . But
     it misses the main point of this section, because it contains no vector field F. This
     section is about work, not just mass.

                           DIFFERENT FORMS OF THE WORK INTEGRAL

     The work integral F ¤ T ds can be written in a better way. The force is F D M i C

     N j. A small step along the curve is dx i C dy j. Work is force times distance, but it is

     only the force component along the path that counts. The dot product F ¤ T ds finds

     that component automatically.
   15.2 Line Integrals                                                                        639

15C The vector to a point on C is R D xi C yj. Then d R D T ds D dx i C dy j W

   ÷            ÷

   work D F ¤ d R D M dx C N dy:                                      (7)

      c            c

Along a space curve the work is F ¤ T ds D F ¤ d R D M dx C N dy C P dz.

The product M dx is (force in x direction)(movement in x direction). This is zero if
either factor is zero. When the only force is gravity, pushing a piano takes no work.
It is friction that hurts. Carrying the piano up the stairs brings in P dz, and the total
work is the piano weight P times the change in z.

 To connect the new F ¤ d R with the old F ¤ T ds, remember the tangent vector

T. It is d R=ds. Therefore T ds is d R. The best for computations is d R, because the
unit vector T has a division by ds=dt D .dx=dt /2 C .dy=dt /2. Later we multiply
by this square root, in converting ds to .ds=dt /dt . It makes no sense to compute the
square root, divide by it, and then multiply by it. That is avoided in the improved form

  M dx C N dy.

EXAMPLE 4 Vector field F D ¡yi C xj, path from (1; 0) to (0; 1): Find the work.

Note 1 This F is the spin field S. It goes around the origin, while R D xi C yj

goes outward. Their dot product is F ¤ R D ¡yx C xy D 0. This does not mean that
F ¤ d R D 0. The force is perpendicular to R, but not to the change in R. The work to

move from .1; 0/ to .0; 1/, x axis to y axis, is not zero.

Note 2 We have not described the path C . That must be done. The spin field is
not a gradient field, and the work along a straight line does not equal the work on a
quarter-circle:

General method The path is given by x.t / and y.t /. Substitute those into M.x; y/
and N.x; y/--then F is a function of t . Also find dx=dt and dy=dt . Integrate

      For practice, take the path down the x axis to the origin .x D 1 ¡ t; y D 0/. Then
     go up the y axis .x D 0; y D t ¡ 1/. The starting time at .1; 0/ is t D 0. The turning

     time at the origin is t D 1. The finishing time at .0; 1/ is t D 2. The integral has two
     parts because this new path has two parts:

          Bent path: ¡y dx C x dy D 0 C 0.y D 0 on one part, then x D 0/:

     Note 3 The answer depended on the path, for this spin field F D S. The answer did

     not depend on the choice of parameter. If we follow the same path at a different speed,

     the work is the same. We can choose another parameter  , since .ds=dt /dt and
     .ds=d  /d  both equal ds. Traveling twice as fast on the straight path .x D 1 ¡ 2;

                CONSERVATION OF TOTAL ENERGY (KINETIC C POTENTIAL)

     When a force field does work on a mass m, it normally gives that mass a new
     velocity. Newton's Law is F D ma D md v=dt . (It is a vector law. Why write out

     three components?) The work F ¤ d R is

                ÷                                                    iQ

                                                                      P

     The work equals the change in the kinetic energy 21 m v 2. But for a gradient field
     the work is also the change in potential--with a minus sign from physics:

                                         ÷                        ÷

                            work D F ¤ d R D ¡ df D f .P / ¡ f .Q/:                                                (9)

     Comparing .8/ with .9/, the combination 21 m v 2 C f is the same at P and Q. The
     total energy, kinetic plus potential, is conserved.

                    INDEPENDENCE OF PATH: GRADIENT FIELDS

     The work of the spin field S depends on the path. Example 4 took three paths--
     straight line, quarter-circle, bent line. The work was 1, =2, and 0, different on each
     path. This happens for more than 99:99% of all vector fields. It does not happen
     for the most important fields. Mathematics and physics concentrate on very special

     fields--for which the work depends only on the endpoints. We now explain what
     happens, when the integral is independent of the path.

       Suppose you integrate from P to Q on one path, and back to P on another path.
     Combined, that is a closed path from P to P (Figure 15:7). But a backward integral
     is the negative of a forward integral, since d R switches sign. If the integrals from
     P to Q are equal, the integral around the closed path is zero:

           úP               ÷Q                    ÷P                     ÷Q              ÷Q

                closed path 1 back path 2 path 1                                                path 2

     The circle on the first integral indicates a closed path. Later we will drop the P ½s.

which fields are conservative, without trying all paths? Here is the crucial
information about conservative fields, in a plane region R with no holes:

  15D F D M.x; y/i C N.x; y/j is a conservative field if it has these properties:

 A. The work F ¤ d R around every closed path is zero.
 B. The work PQF ¤ d R depends only on P and Q, not on the path.

  C. F is a gradient field: M D f = x and N D f = y for some potential f .x; y/.

  D. The components satisfy M= y D N= x.

  A field with one of these properties has them all. D is the quick test.

These statements A ¡ D bring everything together for conservative fields (alias

gradient fields). A closed path goes one way to Q and back the other way to P .
The work cancels, and statements A and B are equivalent. We now connect them to
C. Note: Test D says that the "curl" of F is zero. That can wait for Green's Theorem
in the next section--the full discussion of the curl comes in 15:6.

 First, a gradient field F = grad f is conservative. The work is f .Q/ ¡ f .P /, by

the fundamental theorem for line integrals. It depends only on the endpoints and not
the path. Therefore statement C leads back to B.

  Our job is in the other direction, to show that conservative fields M i C N j are
gradients. Assume that the work integral depends only on the endpoints. We must
construct a potential f , so that F is its gradient. In other words, f = x must be M
and f = y must be N .

   Fix the pointP:Definef .Q/as the work to reach Q:Then F equals grad f:

Check the reasoning. At the starting point P; f is zero. At every other point Q; f is
the work M dx C N dy to reach that point. All paths from P to Q give the same
f .Q/, because the field is assumed conservative. After two examples we prove that
grad f agrees with F--the construction succeeds.

EXAMPLE 5 Find f .x; y/ when F D M i C N j D 2xyi C x2j. We want
 f = x D 2xy and f = y D x2:

Solution 1 Choose P D .0; 0/. Integrate M dx C Ndy along to .x; 0/ and up to
.x; y/:

÷ .x;0/                          ÷ .x;y/

   .0;0/                            .x;0/
642              15 Vector Calculus

     Certainly f D x2y meets the requirements: fx D 2xy and fy D x2. Thus F = grad

     f . Note that dy D 0 in the first integral (on the x axis). Then dx D 0 in the second
     integral (x is fixed). The integrals add to f D x2y.

     Solution 2  Integrate 2xy dx C x2dy on the straight line .xt; yt / from t D 0 to
     t D 1:

     0                    0

     Most authors use Solution 1. I use Solution 2. Most students use Solution 3:

     Solution 3 Directly solve f = x D M D 2xy and then fix up df =dy D N D x2:

                 f = x D 2xy gives f D x2y .plus any function of y/:

     In this example x2y already has the correct derivative f = y D x2. No additional

     function of y is necessary. When we integrate with respect to x, the constant of
     integration (usually C ) becomes a function C.y/.

       You will get practice in finding f . This is only possible for conservative fields! I
     tested M D 2xy and N D x2 in advance (using D) to be sure that M= y D N= x.

     EXAMPLE 6 Look for f .x; y/ when M i C N j is the spin field ¡yi C xj.
     Attempted solution 1 Integrate ¡y dx C x dy from .0; 0/ to .x; 0/ to .x; y/:

     ÷ .x;0/              ÷ .x;y/

          ¡ y dx D 0 and          x dy D xy .which seems like f /:

        .0;0/                .x;0/

     Attempted solution 2 Integrate ¡y dx C x dy on the line .xt; yt / from t D 0 to 1:

                      ÷1

               ¡ .yt/.x dt/ C .xt/.y dt/ D 0 .a different f; also wrong/:

                          0

     Attempted solution 3 Directly solve f = x D ¡y and try to fix up f = y D x:
              f = x D ¡y gives f D ¡xy .plus any function C.y//:

     The y derivative of this f is ¡x C dC =dy. That does not agree with the required
      f = y D x. Conclusion: The spin field ¡yi C xj is not conservative. There is no
     f . Test D gives M= y D ¡1 and N= x D C1.

       To finish this section, we move from examples to a proof. The potential f .Q/ is
     defined as the work to reach Q. We must show that its partial derivatives are M and
     N . This seems reasonable from the formula f .Q/ D M dx C N dy, but we have

     to think it through.
       Remember statement A, that all paths give the same f .Q/. Take a path that goes

     from P to the left of Q. It comes in to Q on a line y = constant (so dy D 0). As the
     path reaches Q, we are only integrating M dx. The derivative of this integral, at Q,
     is f = x D M . That is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

       To show that f = y D N , take a different path. Go from P to a point below Q.
     The path comes up to Q on a vertical line (so dx D 0). Near Q we are only integrating
     Ndy, so f = y D N .

       The requirement that the region must have no holes will be critical for test D.

                       15.3 Green's Theorem

This section contains the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, extended to two
dimensions. That sounds important and it is. The formula was discovered 150 years
after Newton and Leibniz, by an ordinary mortal named George Green. His theorem
connects a double integral over a region R to a line integral along its boundary
C:

 The integral of df =dx equals f .b/ ¡ f .a/: This connects a one-dimensional

integral to a zero-dimensional integral. The boundary only contains two points a and

b! The answer f .b/ ¡ f .a/ is some kind of a "point integral." It is this absolutely

crucial idea--to integrate a derivative from information at the boundary--that
Green's Theorem extends into two dimensions.

 There are two important integrals around C: The work is F ¤ T ds D M dx C
N dy: The flux is F ¤ n ds D M dy ¡ N dx (notice the switch). The first is for

a force field, the second is for a flow field. The tangent vector T turns 90¥ clockwise

to become the normal vector n: Green's Theorem handles both, in two dimensions.
In three dimensions they split into the Divergence Theorem (15.5) and Stokes'
Theorem (15.6).

  Green's Theorem applies to "smooth" functions M.x; y/ and N.x; y/; with con-
tinuous first derivatives in a region slightly bigger than R: Then all integrals are well
defined. M and N will have a definite and specific meaning in each application--to
electricity or magnetism or fluid flow or mechanics. The purpose of a theorem is to
capture the central ideas once and for all. We do that now, and the applications follow.

15E Green's Theorem Suppose the region R is bounded by the simple closed

piecewise smooth curve C: Then an integral over R equals a line integral around

C : ú ÷÷  M dx C N dy D N ¡ M  dx dy: (1)
C  Rx  y

A curve is "simple" if it doesn't cross itself (figure 8's are excluded). It is "closed" if
its endpoint Q is the same as its starting point P: This is indicated by the closed circle
on the integral sign. The curve is "smooth" if its tangent T changes continuously--
the word "piecewise" allows a finite number of corners. Fractals are not allowed,
but all reasonable curves are acceptable (later we discuss figure 8's and rings). First
comes an understanding of the formula, by testing it on special cases.

Fig. 15.8 Area of R adds up strips: x dy D dx dy and y dx D ¡ dy dx:
646                                        15 Vector Calculus

     Special case 1: M D 0 and N D x: Green's Theorem with N= x D 1 becomes

                       ú               ÷÷

                             x dy D 1 dx dy (which is the area of R):                                    (2)

                          C                R

     The integrals look equal, because the inner integral of dx is x: Then both integrals
     have x dy--but we need to go carefully. The area of a layer of R is dy times the

     difference in x (the length of the strip). The line integral in Figure 15.8 agrees. It has

     an upward dy times x (at the right) plus a downward ¡dy times x (at the left). The

     integrals add up the strips, to give the total area.

     Special case 2: M D y and N D 0 and C y dx D R.¡1/dx dy D ¡.area of R/:

     Now Green's formula has a minus sign, because the line integral is counterclock-
     wise. The top of each slice has dx 0 (going left) and the bottom has dx 0 (going
     right). Then y dx at the top and bottom combine to give minus the area of the slice in
     Figure 15.8b.

     Special case 3: 1 dx D 0: The dx's to the right cancel the dx's to the left (the
     curve is closed). With M D 1 and N D 0; Green's Theorem is 0 D 0:

     Most important case: M i C N j is a gradient field. It has a potential function f .x; y/:
     Green's Theorem is 0 D 0; because M= y D N= x: This is test D:

                       M  D f  is the same as N  D f  : (3)
                       y yx                                      x xy

     The cross derivatives always satisfy fyxDfxy: That is why gradient fields pass
     test D:

       When the double integral is zero, the line integral is also zero: C M dx C N dy D
     0: The work is zero. The field is conservative! This last step in A B C D
     A will be complete when Green's Theorem is proved.

       Conservative examples are x dx D 0 and y dy D 0: Area is not involved.

     Remark The special cases x dy and ¡ y dx led to the area of R: As long as
     1 D N= x ¡ M= y; the double integral becomes 1 dx dy: This gives a way to

     compute area by a line integral.

    Two pieces are zero: x dy ¡ y dx D 0 on the sides where x D 0 and y D 0: The

   EXAMPLE 2 The area of an ellipse is ab when the semiaxes have lengths
   a and b.

   This is a classical example, which all authors like. The points on the ellipse are
   x D a cos t; y D b sin t; as t goes from 0 to 2: (The ellipse has .x=a/2 C .y=b/2 D
   1:/ By computing the boundary integral, we discover the area inside. Note that the

   differential x dy ¡ y dx is just ab dt :

    .a cos t/.b cos t dt/ ¡ .b sin t/.¡a sin t dt/ D ab.cos2 t C sin2 t/dt D ab dt:

   The line integral is 2 0 1 2 ab dt D ab: This area ab is  r2; for a circle with
   a D b D r:

     Proof of Green's Theorem: In our special cases, the two sides of the formula
   were equal. We now show that they are always equal. The proof uses the Funda-
   mental Theorem to integrate . N= x/dx and . M= y/dy: Frankly speaking, this
   one-dimensional theorem is all we have to work with--since we don't know M and
   N:

     The proof is a step up in mathematics, to work with symbols M and N instead of
   specific functions. The integral in (6) below has no numbers. The idea is to deal with
   M and N in two separate parts, which added together give Green's Theorem:

      ú ÷÷ M                                      ú             ÷÷     N
                                                                          dx dy:
      C R M dx D ¡ y dx dy        and separately        N dy D
                                                                       x
                                                     C              R             (5)

     Start with a "very simple" region (Figure 15.10a). Its top is given by y D f .x/ and

   its bottom by y D g.x/: In the double integral, integrate ¡ M= y first with respect

   to y: The inner integral is

        ÷ f .x/ ¡ M if .x/ dy D ¡M.x; y/ D ¡M.x; f .x// C M.x; g.x//: (6)
        g .x /         y                 g .x /

   The Fundamental Theorem (in the y variable) gives this answer that depends on x:
   If we knew M and f and g; we could do the outer integral--from x D a to x D b:
   But we have to leave it and go to the other side of Green's Theorem--the line integral:

ú  ÷                   ÷                 ÷a             ÷b

   M dx D M.x; y/dx C             M.x; y/dx D M.x; f .x//dx C M.x; g.x//dx:

   top                    bottom         b              a

                                                                       (7)
648  15 Vector Calculus

      Fig. 15.10 Very simple region (a¡b). Simple region (c) is a union of very simple regions.

     Compare (7) with (6). The integral of M.x; g.x// is the same for both. The integral
     of M.x; f .x// has a minus sign from (6). In .7/ it has a plus sign but the integral is
     from b to a: So life is good.

       The part for N uses the same idea. Now the x integral comes first, because
     . N= x/dx is practically asking to be integrated--from x D G.y/ at the left to x D

     F .y/ at the right. We reach N.F .y/; y/ ¡ N.G.y/; y/: Then the y integral matches

       N dy and completes (5). Adding the two parts of (5) proves Green's Theorem.

       Finally we discuss the shape of R: The broken ring in Figure 15.10 is not "very
     simple," because horizontal lines go in and out and in and out. Vertical lines do the
     same. The x and y strips break into pieces. Our reasoning assumed no break between
     y D f .x/ at the top and y D g.x/ at the bottom.

       There is a nice idea that saves Green's Theorem. Separate the broken ring into
     three very simple regions R1; R2; R3: The three double integrals equal the three
     line integrals around the R's. Now add these separate results, to produce the double
     integral over all of R: When we add the line integrals, the crosscuts C C are covered
     twice and they cancel. The cut between R1 and R2 is covered upward (around R1)
     and downward (around R2). That leaves the integral around the boundary equal to the
     double integral inside--which is Green's Theorem.

       When R is a complete ring, including the piece R4; the theorem is still true. The
     integral around the outside is still counterclockwise. But the integral is clockwise
     around the inner circle. Keep the region R to your left as you go around C: The
     complete ring is "doubly" connected, not "simply" connected. Green's Theorem
     allows any finite number of regions Ri and crosscuts C C and holes.

                                                                            b

     EXAMPLE 3 The area under a curve is a y dx; as we always believed.

     In computing area we never noticed the whole boundary. The true area is a line

     integral ¡ y dx around the closed curve in Figure 15.11a. But y D 0 on the x axis.

     Also dx D 0 on the vertical lines (up and down at b and a). Those parts contribute
     zero to the integral of y dx: The only nonzero part is back along the curve--which is

     the area ¡ ba y dx or ab y dx that we know well.

       What about signs, when the curve dips below the x axis? That area has been
     counted as negative since Chapter 1. I saved the proof for Chapter 15. The reason
     lies in the arrows on C:

       The line integral around that part goes the other way. The arrows are clockwise,
     the region is on the right, and the area counts as negative. With the correct rules, a
     figure 8 is allowed after all.
            15.3 Green's Theorem                                                                         649

      Fig. 15.11 Closed path gives the sign of the area. Nonconservative field because of hole.

            CONSERVATIVE FIELDS

      We never leave gradients alone! They give conservative fields--the work around a

      closed path is f .P / ¡ f .P / D 0: But a potential function f .x; y/ is only available

      when test D is passed: If f = x D M and f = y D N then M= y D N= x.
      The reason is that fxy D fyx:

        Some applications prefer the language of "differentials." Instead of looking for
      f .x; y/; we look for df :

      DEFINITION The expression M.x; y/dx C N.x; y/dy is a differential form. When
      it agrees with the differential df D . f = x/dx C . f = y/dy of some function, the
      form is called exact. The test for an exact differential is D: N= x D M= y:

      Nothing is new but the language. Is y dx an exact differential? No, because My D 1
      and Nx D 0: Is y dx C x dy an exact differential? Yes, it is the differential of f D
      xy: That is the product rule! Now comes an important example, to show why R

      should be simply connected (a region with no holes).

      EXAMPLE 4 The spin field S=r2 D .¡yi C xj/=.x2 C y2/ almost passes test D:

Nx D   x  x2 C y2 ¡ x.2x/   ¡y  ¡.x2 C y2/ C y.2y/
      x x2 C y2 D .x2 C y2/2 D My D y x2 C y2 D .x2 C y2/2 :

                                                                                                    (8)

      Both numerators are y2 ¡ x2: Test D looks good. To find f; integrate M D f = x:

                                 ÷

            f .x; y/ D ¡y dx=.x2 C y2/ D tan¡1.y=x/ C C.y/:

      The extra part C.y/ can be zero--the y derivative of tan¡1.y=x/ gives N with no

      help from C.y/: The potential f is the angle  in the usual x; y; r right triangle.

        Test D is passed and F is grad : What am I worried about? It is only this,

      that Green's Theorem on a circle seems to give 2 D 0: The double integral is

       .Nx ¡ My/dx dy: According to (8) this is the integral of zero. But the line integral

      is 2:

      ú  ú

         F ¤d R D .¡y dx C x dy/=.x2 C y2/D 2.area of circle/=a2D2a2=a2D2:

                                                                                                    (9)
      With x D a cos t and y D a sin t we would find the same answer. The work is 2

      (not zero!) when the path goes around the origin.

        We have a paradox. If Green's Theorem is wrong, calculus is in deep trouble. Some
      requirement must be violated to reach 2 D 0: Looking at S=r2; the problem is at
      the origin. The field is not defined when r D 0 (it blows up). The derivatives in (8)
650                                      15 Vector Calculus

     are not continuous. Test D does not apply at the origin, and was not passed. We could
     remove .0; 0/; but then the region where test D is passed would have a hole.

       It is amazing how one point can change everything. When the path circles the
     origin, the line integral is not zero. The potential function f D  increases by 2.

     That agrees with F ¤ d R D 2 from (9). It disagrees with 0 dx dy: The 2 is
     right, the zero is wrong. Nx ¡ My must be a "delta function of strength 2:"

       The double integral is 2 from an infinite spike over the origin--even though
     Nx D My everywhere else. In fluid flow the delta function is a "vortex."

            FLOW ACROSS A CURVE: GREEN'S THEOREM TURNED BY 90¥

     A flow field is easier to visualize than a force field, because something is really there
     and it moves. Instead of gravity in empty space, water has velocity M.x; y/i C N.x; y/j:
     At the boundary C it can flow in or out. The new form of Green's Theorem is a
     fundamental "balance equation" of applied mathematics:

     Flow through C (out minus in) D replacement in R (source minus sink).

     The flow is steady. Whatever goes out through C must be replaced in R: When there
     are no sources or sinks (negative sources), the total flow through C must be zero.
     This balance law is Green's Theorem in its "normal form" (for n) instead of its
     "tangential form" (for T):

     15F For a steady flow field F D M.x; y/i C N.x; y/j; the flux F ¤ n ds through

     the boundary C balances the replacement of fluid inside R:

                       ú ÷÷  M dy ¡ N dx D M C N  dx dy: (10)
                       C      Rx  y

     Figure 15.12 shows the 90¥ turn. T becomes n and "circulation" along C becomes

     flux through C: In the original form of Green's Theorem, change N and M to M and

     ¡N to obtain the flux form:

     ú              ú     ÷÷                        ÷÷

       M dx C N dy     ¡N dx C M dy .Nx ¡ My/dx dy      .Mx C Ny/dx dy:

                                                                            (11)

     Playing with letters has proved a new theorem! The two left sides in (11) are equal,

     so the right sides are equal--which is Green's Theorem (10) for the flux. The
     components M and N can be chosen freely and named freely.

      The change takes M i C N j into its perpendicular field ¡N i C M j: The field is

     turned at every point (we are not just turning the plane by 90¥). The spin field S D

     ¡yi C xj changes to the position field R D xi C yj: The position field R changes to
     ¡S: Streamlines of one field are equipotentials of the other field. The new form (10)

     of Green's Theorem is just as important as the old one--in fact I like it better. It is

     easier to visualize flow across a curve than circulation along it.
15.3 Green's Theorem                                                                     651

 Fig. 15.12 The perpendicular component F ¤ n flows through C: Note n ds D dy i ¡ dx j:

  The change of letters was just for the proof. From now on F D M i C N j:

EXAMPLE 5 Compute both sides of the new form (10) for F D 2xi C 3yj: The
region R is a rectangle with sides a and b:

Solution This field has M= x C N= y D 2 C 3: The integral over R is
  R 5 dx dy D 5ab: The line integral has four parts, because R has four sides.

Between the left and right sides, M D 2x increases by 2a: Down the left and up
the right, M dy D 2ab (those sides have length b). Similarly N D 3y changes by
3b between the bottom and top. Those sides have length a; so they contribute 3ab to
a total line integral of 5ab:

  Important: The "divergence" of a flow field is M= x C N= y: The example
has divergence D 5: To maintain this flow we must replace 5 units continually--not
just at the origin but everywhere. (A one-point source is in example 7.) The diver-
gence is the source strength, because it equals the outflow. To understand Green's
Theorem for any vector field M i C N j; look at a tiny rectangle (sides dx and
dy):

    Flow out the right side minus flow in the left side D .change in M / times dy
    Flow out the top minus flow in the bottom D .change in N / times dx
    Total flow out of rectangle: dM dy C dN dx D . M= x C N= y/dx dy:

The divergence times the area dx dy equals the total flow out. Section 15:5 gives
more detail with more care in three dimensions. The divergence is Mx C Ny C Pz:

Fig. 15.13 Mx C Ny D 2 C 3 D 5 yields flux D 5.area/ D 5ab: The flux is dM dy C
                dN dx D .Mx C Ny /dx dy: The spin field has no flux.

EXAMPLE 6 Find the flux through a closed curve C of the spin field S D ¡yi C

xj:

Solution The field has M D ¡y and N D x and Mx C Ny D 0: The double inte-

gral is zero. Therefore the total flow (out minus in) is also zero--through any closed

     curve. Figure 15.13 shows flow entering and leaving a square. No fluid is added or
     removed. There is no rain and no evaporation. When the divergence Mx C Ny is
     zero, there is no source or sink.

                                   FLOW FIELDS WITHOUT SOURCES

     This is really quite important. Remember that conservative fields do no work
     around C; they have a potential f; and they have "zero curl." Now turn those

     statements through 90¥; to find their twins. Source-free fields have no flux

     through C; they have stream functions g; and they have "zero divergence."
     The new statements E-F-G-H describe fields without sources.

       15G The field F D M.x; y/i C N.x; y/j is source-free if it has these properties:

      E The total flux F ¤ n ds through every closed curve is zero.
      F Across all curves from P to Q; the flux PQ F ¤ n ds is the same.
      G There is a stream function g.x; y/; for which M D g= y and N D ¡ g= x:

       H The components satisfy M= x C N= y D 0 (the divergence is zero).
       A field with one of these properties has them all. H is the quick test.

     The spin field ¡yi C xj passed this test (Example 6 was source-free). The field

     2xi C 3yj does not pass (Example 5 had Mx C Ny D 5). Example 7 almost passes.

     EXAMPLE 7 The radial field R=r2 D .xi C yj/=.x2 C y2/ has a point source
     at .0; 0/:

     The new test H is divergence D M= x C N= y D 0: Those two derivatives are

      x  x2 C y2 ¡ x.2x/          y  x2 C y2 ¡ y.2y/
               D            and            D  2 2 2 : (12)

                  .x C y /

     They add to zero. There seems to be no source (if the calculation is correct). The flow
     through a circle x2 C y2 D a2 should be zero. But it's not:

     A source is hidden somewhere. Looking at R=r2; the problem is at .0; 0/: The field
     is not defined when r D 0 (it blows up). The derivatives in (12) are not continuous.
     Test H does not apply, and was not passed. The divergence Mx C Ny must be a "delta
     function" of strength 2: There is a point source sending flow out through all circles.

       I hope you see the analogy with Example 4. The field S=r2 is curl-free except at
     r D 0: The field R=r2 is divergence-free except at r D 0: The mathematics is parallel
     and the fields are perpendicular. A potential f and a stream function g require a

     region without holes.

                 THE BEST FIELDS: CONSERVATIVE AND SOURCE-FREE

What if F is conservative and also source-free? Those are outstandingly important
fields. The curl is zero and the divergence is zero. Because the field is conservative, it
comes from a potential. Because it is source-free, there is a stream function:

                             M D f D g and N D f D ¡ g : (14)
                                       xy                       y      x

Those are the Cauchy-Riemann equations, named after a great mathematician of
his time and one of the greatest of all time. I can't end without an example.

EXAMPLE 8 Show that yi C xj is both conservative and source-free. Find f and g:

Solution With M D y and N D x; check first that M= y D 1 D N= x: There

must be a potential function. It is f Dxy; which achieves f = x Dy and f = y D

    Check next that M= x C N= y D 0 C 0: There must be a stream function. It

is  gD  2  .  y  2     x  2  /  ;  which  achieves  g= yDy and

gyy D0:

    The curves f D constant are the equipotentials. The curves g D constant are

the streamlines (Figure 15.4). These are the twin properties--a conservative field with

a potential and a source-free field with a stream function. They come together into

the fundamental partial differential equation of equilibrium--Laplace's equation

fxx C fyy D 0:

    15H There is a potential and stream function when My D Nx and Mx D ¡Ny:

    They satisfy Laplace's equation:

     fxx C fyy D Mx C Ny D 0 and gxx C gyy D ¡Nx C My D 0: (15)

If we have f without g; as in f D x2 C y2 and M D 2x and N D 2y; we don't have
Laplace's equation: fxx C fyy D 4: This is a gradient field that needs a source. If

we have g without f; as in g D x2 C y2 and M D 2y and N D ¡2x; we don't have

Laplace's equation. The field is source-free but it has spin. The first field is 2R and
the second field is 2S:

  With no source and no spin, we are with Laplace at the center of mathematics and
science.

     The double integral in Green's Theorem is over a flat surface R. Now the region
     moves out of the plane. It becomes a curved surface S , part of a sphere or cylinder

     z.x; y/. In other cases S can twist and close up--a sphere has an upper z and a lower
     z. In all cases we want to compute area and flux. This is a necessary step (it is our last
     step) before moving Green's Theorem to three dimensions.

       First a quick review. The basic integrals are dx and dx dy and dx dy dz.
     The one that didn't fit was ds--the length of a curve. When we go from curves

     to surfaces, ds becomes dS . Area is dS and flux is F ¤ n dS , with double

     integrals because the surfaces are two-dimensional. The main difficulty is in dS .
       All formulas are summarized in a table at the end of the section.

       There are two ways to deal with ds (along curves). The same methods apply to dS
     (on surfaces). The first is in xyz coordinates; the second uses parameters. Before this
     subject gets complicated, I will explain those two methods.

     Method 1 is for the graph of a function: curve y.x/ or surface z.x; y/.

     A small piece of the curve is almost straight. It goes across by dx and up by dy:

     length ds D .dx/2 C .dy/2 D 1 C .dy=dx/2 dx:                                       (1)

     A small piece of the surface is practically flat. Think of a tiny sloping rectangle. One
     side goes across by dx and up by . z= x/dx. The neighboring side goes along by
     dy and up by . z= y/dy. Computing the area is a linear problem (from Chapter 11),
     because the flat piece is in a plane.

       Two vectors A and B form a parallelogram. The length of their cross product is
     the area. In the present case, the vectors are A D i C . z= x/k and B D j C . z= y/k.

     Then Adx and Bdy are the sides of the small piece, and we compute A ¢ B:

     §      §

     §§i j  k §§
     A ¢ B D §1 0 z= x § D ¡ z= x i ¡ z= y j C k:
     §      §                                                                           (2)

     §      §
     §0 1 z= y §

     This is exactly the normal vector N to the tangent plane and the surface, from
     Chapter 13. Please note: The small flat piece is actually a parallelogram (not always

     a rectangle). Its area dS is much like ds, but the length of N D A ¢ B involves two

     derivatives:

      area dS D Adx ¢ Bdy D N dxdy D 1 C . z= x/2 C . z= y/2 dx dy: (3)

     EXAMPLE 1 Find the area on the plane z D x C 2y above a base area A.

     This is the example to visualize. The area down in the xy plane is A. The area up
     on the sloping plane is greater than A. A roof has more area than the room underneath

     it. If the roof goes up at a 45¥ angle, the ratio is 2. Formula (3) yields the correct

     ratio for any surface--including our plane z D x C 2y.
15.4 Surface Integrals                                                                   657

Fig. 15.14 Roof area = base area times |N|. Cone and cylinder with parameters u and v.

  The derivatives are z= x D 1 and z= y D 2. They are constant (planes are easy).
The square root in (3) contains 1 C 12 C 22 D 6. Therefore dS D 6 dx dy. An area
in the xy plane is multiplied by 6 up in the surface (Figure 15.14a). The vectors A
and B are no longer needed--their work was done when we reached formula (3)--but
here they are:

  A D i C . z= x/k D i C k B D j C . z= y/k D j C 2k N D ¡i ¡ 2j C k:

The length of N D A ¢ B is 6. The angle between k and N has cos  D 1= 6.

That is the angle between base plane and sloping plane. Therefore the sloping
area is 6 times the base area. For curved surfaces the idea is the same, except that
the square root in N D 1= cos changes as we move around the surface.

  Method 2 is for curves x.t/; y.t/ and surfaces x.u; v/; y.u; v/; z.u; v/ with
                                         parameters.

A curve has one parameter t . A surface has two parameters u and v (it is two-
dimensional). One advantage of parameters is that x; y; z get equal treatment, instead
of picking out z as f .x; y/. Here are the first two examples:

cone x D u cosv; y D u sin v; z D u cylinder x D cosv; y D sin v; z D u: (4)

Each choice of u and v gives a point on the surface. By making all choices, we get
the complete surface. Notice that a parameter can equal a coordinate, as in z D u.
Sometimes both parameters are coordinates, as in x D u and y D v and z D f .u; v/.
That is just z D f .x; y/ in disguise--the surface without parameters. In other cases
we find the xyz equation by eliminating u and v:

cone .u cosv/2 C .u sin v/2 D u2 or x2 C y2 D z2 or z D  x2 Cy2
cylinder .cos v/2 C .sin v/2 D 1 or x2 C y2 D 1:

The cone is the graph of f D x2 C y2. The cylinder is not the graph of any func-

tion. There is a line of z½s through each point on the circle x2 C y2 D 1. That is what

z D u tells us: Give u all values, and you get the whole line. Give u and v all values,
and you get the whole cylinder. Parameters allow a surface to close up and even go
through itself--which the graph of f .x; y/ can never do.

  Actually z D x2 C y2 gives only the top half of the cone. (A function produces

only one z.) The parametric form gives the bottom half also. Similarly y D 1 ¡ x2

gives only the top of a circle, while x D cost; y D sin t goes all the way around.

                   Now we find dS , using parameters. Small movements give a piece of the surface,
                 practically flat. One side comes from the change du, the neighboring side comes from
                 dv. The two sides are given by small vectors Adu and Bdv:

                                   A D x i C y j C z k and B D x i C y j C z k: (5)
                                   uuu                     vvv

                 To find the area dS of the parallelogram, start with the cross product N D A ¢ B:

              §                 §                   !                   !                   !

                 Admittedly this looks complicated--actual examples are often fairly simple. The area

                 dS of the small piece of surface is N du dv. The length N is a square root:

     dS D                         !2                   !2                   !2

                                                                                                    (7)

                 EXAMPLE 2 Find A and B and N D A ¢ B and dS for the cone and cylinder.

                 The cone has x D u cosv, y D u sinv, z D u. The u derivatives produce A D R= u D
                 cos v i C sin v j C k. The v derivatives produce the other tangent vector B D R= v D

                 ¡u sinv i C u cosv j. The normal vector is A ¢ B D ¡u cosv i ¡ u sin v j C u k. Its

                 length gives dS :

                   dS D A ¢ B du dv D .u cosv/2 C .u sinv/2 C u2 du dv D 2 u du dv:

                 The cylinder is even simpler: dS D dudv. In these and many other examples, A is
                 perpendicular to B. The small piece is a rectangle. Its sides have length A du
                 and B dv. (The cone has A D u and B D 2, the cylinder has A D B D 1).
                 The cross product is hardly needed for area, when we can just multiply A du times
                 B dv.

                 Remark on the two methods Method 1 also used parameters, but a very special
                 choice--u is x and v is y. The parametric equations are x D x, y D y, z D f .x; y/.
                 If you go through the long square root in (7), changing u to x and v to y, it simplifies
                 to the square root in (3). (The terms y= x and x= y are zero; x= x and y= y
                 are 1.) Still it pays to remember the shorter formula from Method 1.

                   Don't forget that after computing dS , you have to integrate it. Many times the
                 good is with polar coordinates. Surfaces are often symmetric around an axis or a
                 point. Those are the surfaces of revolution--which we saw in Chapter 8 and will
                 come back to.

                   Strictly speaking, the integral starts with S (not dS ). A flat piece has area

                 A ¢ B xy or A ¢ B uv. The area of a curved surface is properly defined

                 as a limit. The key step of calculus, from sums of S to the integral of dS , is safe for
                         15.4 Surface Integrals                                                  659

smooth surfaces. In examples, the hard part is computing the double integral and
substituting the limits on x; y or u; v.

EXAMPLE 3 Find the surface area of the cone z D x2 C y2 up to the height
z D a.
We use Method 1 (no parameters). The derivatives of z are computed, squared, and
added:

zD x                  zD y                       N 2 D 1 C x C D 2: 2 y2
x  x2 Cy2             y         x2 Cy2                        x2 Cy2 x2 Cy2

Conclusion: N D 2 and dS D 2 dx dy. The cone is on a 45¥ slope, so the area

dx dy in the base is multiplied by 2 in the surface above it (Figure 15.15). The
square root in dS accounts for the extra area due to slope. A horizontal surface has
dS D 1 dx dy, as we have known all year.

  Now for a key point. The integration is down in the base plane. The limits
on x and y are given by the "shadow" of the cone. To locate that shadow set z D

   x2 C y2 equal to z D a. The plane cuts the cone at the circle x2 C y2 D a2. We
integrate over the inside of that circle (where the shadow is):

           surface area of cone D                2 dx dy D 2 a2:

                                     shadow

EXAMPLE 4 Find the same area using dS D 2 u du dv from Example 2.

With parameters, dS looks different and the shadow in the base looks different. The
circle x2 C y2 D a2 becomes u2 cos2 v C u2 sin2 v D a2. In other words u D a. (The
cone has z D u, the plane has z D a, they meet when u D a.) The angle parameter v
goes from 0 to 2. The effect of these parameters is to switch us "automatically" to
polar coordinates, where area is r dr d :

                                             2 a

   surface area of cone D            dS D            2 u du dv D 2 a2:

   Fig. 15.15 Cone cut by plane leaves shadow in the base. Integrate over the shadow.

Solution The cone still has dS D 2 dx dy, but the limits of integration are changed.
The plane cuts the cone in an ellipse. Its shadow down in the xy plane is another
660                                     15 Vector Calculus

     ellipse (Figure 15.15c). To find the edge of the shadow, set z D  x2 C y2 equal
                  ¡
     to  z  D  1     1  x.  We  square  both  sides:
                     2

              x2 C y2 D 1 ¡ x C 14 x2 or 34 .x C 32 /2 C y2 D 34 :

     This is the ellipse in the base--where height makes no difference and z is gone. The
     area of an ellipse is ab, when the equation is in the form .x=a/2 C .y=b/2 D 1.
     After multiplying by 3=4 we find a D 4=3 and b D 4=3. Then ' 2 dx dy D

       2 ab is the surface area of the cone.
       The hard part was finding the shadow ellipse (I went quickly). Its area ab came
     from Example 15:3:2. The new part is 2 from the slope.

     EXAMPLE 6 Find the surface area of a sphere of radius a (known to be 4a2).

     This is a good example, because both methods almost work. The equation of the

     sphere is x2 C y2 C z2 D a2. Method 1 writes z D a2 ¡ x2 ¡ y2. The x and
     y derivatives are ¡x=z and ¡y=z:

                        ! z 2 ! z 2 z2 x2 y2 a2 a2

           1C x C y D z2 C z2 C z2 D z2 D a2 ¡x2 ¡y2 :

     The square root gives dS D a dx dy= a2 ¡ x2 ¡ y2. Notice that z is gone (as it

     should be). Now integrate dS over the shadow of the sphere, which is a circle.
     Instead of dx dy, switch to polar coordinates and r dr d :

                            ÷ 2 ÷ a dS D a r dr d D ¡2a a2 ¡ r2a 2 0 D 2a : (8)
                  shadow        0 0 a2 ¡r2

     This calculation is successful but wrong. 2a2 is the area of the half-sphere above

     the xy plane. The lower half takes the negative square root of z2 D a2 ¡ x2 ¡ y2.

     This shows the danger of Method 1, when the surface is not the graph of a function.

     EXAMPLE 7 (same sphere by Method 2: use parameters) The natural choice is
     spherical coordinates. Every point has an angle u D  down from the North Pole and
     an angle v D  around the equator. The xyz coordinates from Section 14.4 are
     x D a sin  cos  , y D a sin  sin  , z D a cos . The radius  D a is fixed (not
     a parameter). Compute the first term in equation (6), noting z=  D 0:

     . y= /. z=  / ¡ . z= /. y=  / D ¡.¡a sin /.a sin  cos  / D a2 sin2  cos:

     The other terms in (6) are a2 sin2  sin  and a2 sin  cos . Then dS in equation
     (7) squares these three components and adds. We factor out a4 and simplify:

     a4.sin4  cos2  C sin4  sin2  C sin2  cos2 / D a4.sin4  C sin2  cos 2 / D a4 sin2 :

     Conclusion: dS D a2 sin  d d . A spherical person will recognize this immedi-
     ately. It is the volume element d V D 2 sin  d d d , except d is missing. The
     small box has area dS and thickness d and volume d V . Here we only want dS :

                                        ÷÷            ÷ 2 ÷ 

                     area of sphere D dS D                    a2 sin  d d D 4a2:  (9)

                                                      00

     Figure 15.16a shows a small surface with sides a d and a sin  d . Their prod-

     uct is dS . Figure 15.16b goes back to Method 1, where equation (8) gave dS D

     .a=z/ dx dy.

  I doubt that you will like Figure 15.16c--and you don't need it. With parameters
 and  , the shadow of the sphere is a rectangle. The equator is the line down the
middle, where  D =2. The height is z D a cos. The area d d in the base is the
shadow of dS D a2 sin  d d up in the sphere. Maybe this figure shows what we
don't halve to know about parameters.

EXAMPLE 8 Rotate y Dx2 around the x axis. Find the surface area using parame-
ters.
The first parameter is x (from a to b). The second parameter is the rotation angle 
(from 0 to 2). The points on the surface in Figure 15.17 are x D x, y D x2 cos  ,
z D x2 sin  . Equation (7) leads after much calculation to dS D x2 1 C 4x2 dx d .

  Main point: dS agrees with Section 8.3, where the area was 2y
   1 C .dy=dx/2 dx. The 2 comes from the  integral and y is x2. Parameters
give this formula automatically.

             VECTOR FIELDS AND THE INTEGRAL OF F ¤ n

Formulas for surface area are dominated by square roots. There is a square root in
dS , as there was in ds. Areas are like arc lengths, one dimension up. The good point

about line integrals F ¤ nds is that the square root disappears. It is in the denominator
of n, where ds cancels it: F ¤ nds D M dy ¡ N dx. The same good thing will now
happen for surface integrals F ¤ ndS .

This formula tells what to integrate, given the surface and the vector field (f and F).
The xy limits come from the shadow. Formula (10) takes the normal vector from
Method 1:

   N D ¡ f = x i ¡ f = y j C k and N D 1 C . f = x/2 C . f = y/2:
662                                 15 Vector Calculus

            For the unit normal vector n, divide N by its length: n D N= N . The square root is
            in the denominator, and the same square root is in dS . See equation (3):

            F¤ ndS D F¤ N                                  !

                                    dx dy D ¡M f ¡ N f C P dx dy: (11)
                                             x          y

            That is formula (10), with cancellation of square roots. The expression F ¤ ndS is
            often written as F ¤ d S, again relying on boldface to make d S a vector. Then d S

            equals ndS , with direction n and magnitude dS .

Fig. 15.17  Surface of revolution: parameters x; . Fig. 15.18 F ¤ n dS gives flow through dS.

            EXAMPLE 9 Find ndS for the plane z D x C 2y. Then find F ¤ ndS for F D k.

            This plane produced 6 in Example 1 (for area). For flux the 6 disappears:

                      ndS D N dS D ¡i ¡ 2j C k 6 dx dy D .¡i ¡ 2j C k/ dx dy:
                               N    6

            For the flow field F D k, the dot product k ¤ ndS reduces to 1dx dy. The slope of

            the plane makes no difference! The flow through the base also flows through the

            plane. The areas are different, but flux is like rain. Whether it hits a tent or the ground
            below, it is the same rain (Figure 15.18). In this case F ¤ ndS D dx dy D shadow

                      F¤ndS D ¡x    x2 Cy2

            The zero comes as a surprise, but it shouldn't. The cone goes straight out

            from the origin, and so does F. The vector n that is perpendicular to the cone is

            also perpendicular to F. There is no flow through the cone, because F ¤ n D 0. The

            flow travels out along rays.

                          F ¤ ndS FOR A SURFACE WITH PARAMETERS

            In Example 10 the cone was z D f .x; y/ D x2 C y2. We found dS by Method 1.
            Parameters were not needed (more exactly, they were x and y). For surfaces that fold
            and twist, the formulas with u and v look complicated but the actual calculations can
            be simpler. This was certainly the case for dS D du dv on the cylinder.

             A small piece of surface has area dS D A ¢ B du dv. The vectors along the sides

            are A D xui C yuj C zuk and B D xvi C yvj C zvk. They are tangent to the surface.

Now we put their cross product N D A ¢ B to another use, because F ¤ ndS involves

not only area but direction. We need the unit vector n to see how much flow goes
through.

  The direction vector is n D N= N . Equation (7) is dS D N du dv, so the square
root N cancels in ndS . This leaves a nice formula for the "normal component" of
flow:

EXAMPLE 11 Find the flux of F D xi C yj C zk through the cylinder x2 C y2 D
1, 0 z b.

Solution The surface of the cylinder is x D cosu, y D sin u, z D v. The tangent

vectors from (5) are A D .¡ sinu/i C .cosu/j and B D k. The normal vector in

Figure 15.19 goes straight out through the cylinder:

      N D A ¢ B D cosu i C sin u j (check A ¤ N D 0 and B ¤ N D 0/:
To find F ¤ N, switch F D xi C yj C zk to the parameters u and v. Then F ¤ N D 1:

     F ¤ N D .cosu i C sin u j C v k/ ¤ .cos u i C sin u j/ D cos2 u C sin2 u:
For the flux, integrate F ¤ N D 1 and apply the limits on u D  and v D z:

     flux D           1 du dv D 2b D surface area of the cylinder:

             00

Note that the top and bottom were not included! We can find those fluxes too. The

outward direction is n D k at the top and n D ¡k down through the bottom. Then
F ¤ n is Cz D b at the top and ¡z D 0 at the bottom. The bottom flux is zero, the top

flux is b times the area (or b). The total flux is 2b C b D 3b. Hold that answer
for the next section.

  Apology: I made u the angle and v the height. Then N goes outward not inward.

EXAMPLE 12 Find the flux of F D k out the top half of the sphere x2 C y2 C z2 D
a2.

Solution Use spherical coordinates. Example 7 had u D  and v D  . We found

     N D A ¢ B D a2 sin2  cos  i C a2 sin2  sin  j C a2 sin2  cos  k:
The dot product with F D k is F ¤ N D a2 sin  cos . The integral goes from the pole

to the equator,  D 0 to  D =2, and around from  D 0 to  D 2:

     flux D a2 sin  cos  d d D 2a2 ÷ 2 ÷ =2 sin2  D a2 =2 :
                              20

The next section will show that the flux remains at a2 through any surface (!) that
is bounded by the equator. A special case is a flat surface--the disk of radius a at the

           equator.  Figure  15.18  shows  n  D  k  pointing  directly  up,  so  F  ¤  n  D  k  ¤  k  D  1.  The  flux
             '
           is 1 dS = area of disk = a2. All fluid goes past the equator and out through

           the sphere.

Fig. 15.19 Flow through cylinder.                                Fig. 15.20 MoRbius strip (no way to choose n).

           I have to mention one more problem. It might not occur to a reasonable person, but
           sometimes a surface has only one side. The famous example is the MoRbius strip, for
           which you take a strip of paper, twist it once, and tape the ends together. Its

           special property appears when you run a pen along the "inside." The pen in

           Figure 15.20 suddenly goes "outside." After another round trip it goes back "inside."
           Those words are in quotation marks, because on a MoRbius strip they have no meaning.

             Suppose the pen represents the normal vector. On a sphere n points outward.
           Alternatively n could point inward; we are free to choose. But the MoRbius strip makes

           the choice impossible. After moving the pen continuously, it comes back in the

           opposite direction. This surface is not orientable. We cannot integrate F ¤ n to

           compute the flux, because we cannot decide the direction of n.
             A surface is oriented when we can and do choose n. This uses the final property

           of cross products, that they have length and direction and also a right-hand rule. We

           can tell A ¢ B from B ¢ A. Those give the two orientations of n. For an open surface

           (like a wastebasket) you can select either one. For a closed surface (like a sphere) it is
           conventional for n to be outward. By making that decision once and for all, the sign
           of the flux is established: outward flux is positive.

                      15.5 The Divergence Theorem

     This section returns to the fundamental law .flow out/ ¡ .flow in/ D .source/. In

     two dimensions, the flow was in and out through a closed curve C . The plane region
     inside was R. In three dimensions, the flow enters and leaves through a closed surface
     S: The solid region inside is V: Green's Theorem in its normal form (for the flux of
     a smooth vector field) now becomes the great three-dimensional balance equation--
     the Divergence Theorem:

       15K The flux of F D M i C N j C P k through the boundary surface S equals
       the integral of the divergence of F inside V: The Divergence Theorem is

        ÷÷ ÷÷÷ ÷÷÷  F ¤ ndS D div F d V D M C N C P  dx dy dz: (1)

                                                           xyz

     In Green's Theorem the divergence was M= x C N= y: The new term P = z
     accounts for upward flow. Notice that a constant upward component P adds nothing
     to the divergence (its derivative is zero). It also adds nothing to the flux (flow up
     through the top equals flow up through the bottom). When the whole field F is
     constant, the theorem becomes 0 D 0:

       There are other vector fields with div F D 0: They are of the greatest importance.
     The Divergence Theorem for those fields is again 0 D 0; and there is conservation of
     fluid. When div F D 0; flow in equals flow out. We begin with examples of these
     "divergence-free" fields.

     EXAMPLE 1 The spin fields ¡yi C xj C 0k and 0i ¡ zj C yk have zero divergence.

     The first is an old friend, spinning around the z axis. The second is new, spinning
     around the x axis. Three-dimensional flow has a great variety of spin fields. The
     separate terms M= x, N= y, P = z are all zero, so div F D 0: The flow goes
     around in circles, and whatever goes out through S comes back in. (We might have
     put a circle on s as we did on c; to emphasize that S is closed.)

     EXAMPLE 2 The position field R D xi C yj C zk has div R D 1 C 1 C 1 D 3:

     This is radial flow, straight out from the origin. Mass has to be added at every point
     to keep the flow going. On the right side of the divergence theorem is 3 d V:
     Therefore the flux is three times the volume.

       Example 11 in Section 15.4 found the flux of R through a cylinder. The answer
     was 3b: Now we also get 3b from the Divergence Theorem, since the volume is
     b: This is one of many cases in which the triple integral is easier than the double
     integral.

     EXAMPLE 3 An electrostatic field R=3 or gravity field ¡R=3 almost has div

     F D 0:

     The vector R D xi C yj C zk has length x2 C y2 C z2 D : Then F has length
     =3 (inverse square law). Gravity from a point mass pulls inward (minus sign). The
     electric field from a point charge repels outward. The three steps almost show that
     div F D 0:

     Step 1. = x D x=; = y D y=; = z D z=--but do not add those three. F
     is not  or 1=2 (these are scalars). The vector field is R=3: We need M= x; N= y;

      P= z:
                            15.5 The Divergence Theorem                                 667

Step 2. M= x D = x.x=3/ is equal to 1=3 ¡ .3x = x/=4 D 1=3 ¡ 3x2=5:

For N= y and P = z; replace 3x2 by 3y2 and 3z2: Now add those three.

Step 3. div F D 3=3 ¡ 3.x2 C y2 C z2/=5 D 3=3 ¡ 3=3 D 0:

The calculation div F D 0 leaves a puzzle. One side of the Divergence Theorem seems

to give 0 d V D 0: Then the other side should be F ¤ ndS D 0: But the flux is

not zero when all flow is outward:

       The unit normal vector to the sphere  D constant is n D R=:

    The outward flow F ¤ n D .R=3/ ¤ .R=/ D 2=4 is always positive.
    Then F ¤ ndS D dS=2 D 42=2 D 4: We have reached 4 D

       0:

  This paradox in three dimensions is the same as for R=r2 in two dimensions.
Section 15.3 reached 2 D 0; and the explanation was a point source at the origin.
Same explanation here: M; N; P are infinite when  D 0: The divergence is a "delta
function" times 4; from the point source. The Divergence Theorem does not apply
(unless we allow delta functions). That single point makes all the difference.

  Every surface enclosing the origin has fluxD 4: Our calculation was for a
sphere. The surface integral is much harder when S is twisted (Figure 15.21a). But the
Divergence Theorem takes care of everything, because div F D 0 in the volume V be-

tween these surfaces. Therefore F ¤ ndS D 0 for the two surfaces together. The
flux F ¤ ndS D ¡4 into the sphere must be balanced by F ¤ ndS D 4 out of

the twisted surface.

Fig. 15.21 Point source: flux 4 through all enclosing surfaces. Net flux upward
                D . P = z/dV:

  Instead of a paradox 4 D 0; this example leads to Gauss's Law. A mass M at the

origin produces a gravity field F D ¡GM R=3: A charge q at the origin produces

an electric field E D .q=4"0/R=3: The physical constants are G and "0; the math-
ematical constant is the relation between divergence and flux. Equation (1) yields
equation (2), in which the mass densities M.x; y; z/ and charge densities q.x; y; z/
need not be concentrated at the origin:

     THE REASONING BEHIND THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM

     The general principle is clear: Flow out minus flow in equals source. Our goal is to see

     why the divergence of F measures the source. In a small box around each point,

     we show that div F d V balances F ¤ ndS through the six sides.

       So consider a small box. Its center is at .x; y; z/: Its edges have length x; y; z:

     Out of the top and bottom, the normal vectors are k and ¡k: The dot product with
     F D M i C N j C P k is CP or ¡P: The area S is xy: So the two fluxes are
     close to P .x; y; z C 21 z/xy and ¡P .x; y; z ¡ 21 z/xy: When the top is

     combined with the bottom, the difference of those P 's is P :

     net flux upward P xy D .P =z/xyz . P = z/V: (3)

     Similarly, the combined flux on two side faces is approximately ( N= y/V: On the
     front and back it is ( M= x/V: Adding the six faces, we reach the key point:

     flux out of the box . M= x C N= y C P = z/V:  (4)

     This is (div F)V: For a constant field both sides are zero--the flow goes straight
     through. For F D xi C yj C zk; a little more goes out than comes in. The divergence
     is 3; so 3V is created inside the box. By the balance equation the flux is also 3V:

       The approximation symbol means that the leading term is correct (probably not
     the next term). The ratio P =z is not exactly P = z: The difference is of order
     z; so the error in (3) is of higher order Vz: Added over many boxes (about
     1=V boxes), this error disappears as z 0:

       The sum of (div F)V over all the boxes approaches .div F/d V: On the other

     side of the equation is a sum of fluxes. There is F ¤ nS out of the top of one box, plus
     F ¤ nS out of the bottom of the box above. The first has n D k and the second has
     n D ¡k: They cancel each other--the flow goes from box to box. This happens

     every time two boxes meet. The only fluxes that survive (because nothing cancels
     them) are at the outer surface S: The final step, as x; y; z 0; is that those

     outside terms approach F ¤ ndS: Then the local divergence theorem (4) becomes

     the global Divergence Theorem (1).

     Remark on the proof That "final step" is not easy, because the box surfaces don't
     line up with the outer surface S: A formal proof of the Divergence Theorem would im-
     itate the proof of Green's Theorem. On a very simple region . P = z/dx dy dz

     equals P dx dy over the top minus P dx dy over the bottom. After checking

     the orientation this is P k ¤ ndS: Similarly the volume integrals of M= x and
      N= y are the surface integrals M i ¤ ndS and N j ¤ ndS: Adding the three in-

     tegrals gives the Divergence Theorem. Since Green's Theorem was already proved in
     this way, the reasoning behind (4) is more helpful than repeating a detailed proof.

       The discoverer of the Divergence Theorem was probably Gauss. His notebooks
     only contain the outline of a proof--but after all, this is Gauss. Green and Ostro-
     gradsky both published proofs in 1828; one in England and the other in St. Peters-
     burg (now Leningrad). As the theorem was studied, the requirements came to light
     (smoothness of F and S; avoidance of one-sided Möbius strips).

       New applications are discovered all the time--when a scientist writes down a bal-
     ance equation in a small box. The source is known. The equation is div F Dsource.
     After Example 5 we explain F:

  This example illustrates the basic framework of equilibrium. The pattern ap-
pears everywhere in applied mathematics--electromagnetism, heat flow, elasticity,
even
relativity. There is usually a constant c that depends on the material (the example
has c D 1). The names change, but we always take the divergence of the gradient:

    potential f   force field ¡ c grad f: Then div.¡c grad f / D electric charge
temperature T      flow field ¡ c grad T: Then div.¡c grad T / D heat source
displacement u    stress field C c grad u: Then div.¡c grad u/ D outside force:

You are studying calculus, not physics or thermodynamics or elasticity. But please

notice the main point. The equation to solve is div.¡c grad f / D known source. The

divergence and gradient are exactly what the applications need. Calculus teaches the

right things.
  This framework is developed in many books, including my own text Introduc-

tion to Applied Mathematics (Wellesley-Cambridge Press). It governs equilibrium,
in matrix equations and differential equations.

     PRODUCT RULE FOR VECTORS: INTEGRATION BY PARTS

May I go back to basic facts about the divergence? First the definition:

 F.x; y; z/ D M i C N j C P k has div F D r ¤ F D M= x C N= y C P = z:

The divergence is a scalar (not a vector). At each point div F is a number. In fluid
flow, it is the rate at which mass leaves--the "flux per unit volume" or "flux density."

  The symbol r stands for a vector whose components are operations not numbers:

                  r D "del" D i = x C j = y C k = z:                   (6)

This vector is illegal but very useful. First, apply it to an ordinary function f .x; y; z/:

         rf D "del f " D i f = x C j f = y C k f = z D gradient of f: (7)

Second, take the dot product r ¤ F with a vector function F.x; y; z/ D M i C N j C

P k:

  r ¤ F D "del dot F" D M= x C N= y C P = z D divergence of F: (8)
670                     15 Vector Calculus

     Third, take the cross product r ¢ F: This produces the vector curl F (next section):

                 r ¢ F D "del cross F" D : : :(to be defined): : : D curl of F:    (9)

     The gradient and divergence and curl are r and r¤ and r ¢ : The three great

     operations of vector calculus use a single notation! You are free to write r or not--to

     make equations shorter or to help the memory. Notice that Laplace's equation

     shrinks to

                  r ¤ rf D f   C f   C f  D 0: (10)
                        xx                     yy                      zz

     Equation (10) gives the potential when the source is zero (very common). F D grad f
     combines with div F D 0 into Laplace's equation div grad f D 0: This equation
     is so important that it shrinks further to r2f D 0 and even to f D 0: Of course

     f D fxx C fyy C fzz has nothing to do with f D f .x C x/ ¡ f .x/: Above

     all, remember that f is a scalar and F is a vector: gradient of scalar is vector and

     divergence of vector is scalar.

       Underlying this chapter is the idea of extending calculus to vectors. So far we have
     emphasized the Fundamental Theorem. The integral of df =dx is now the integral
     of div F: Instead of endpoints a and b; we have a curve C or surface S: But it is the

     rules for derivatives and integrals that make calculus work, and we need them now for
     vectors. Remember the derivative of u times v and the integral (by parts) of u dv=dx:

     15M Scalar functions u.x; y; z/ and vector fields V.x; y; z/ obey the product

     rule:              div.uV/ D u div V C V ¤ .grad u/:

                                                                                 (11)

     The reverse of the product rule is integration by parts (Gauss's Formula):

     ÷÷÷                           ÷÷÷                                     ÷÷÷

                 u div V dx dy dz D ¡ V ¤ .grad u/ dx dy dz C u V ¤ n dS:

                                                                                 (12)

     For a plane field this is Green's Formula (and u D 1 gives Green's Theorem):

     ÷÷          MC     N  ÷÷  dx dy D ¡ M        u CN                 u  ÷ dx dy C u.M i C N j/ ¤ n ds:
        u        x                                x
                        y                                              y
                                                                                                     (13)

     Those look like heavy formulas. They are too much to memorize, unless you use
     them often. The important point is to connect vector calculus with "scalar calculus,"
     which is not heavy. Every product rule yields two terms:

     .uM /x D u M= x C M u= x .uN /y D u N= y C N u= y .uP /z D u P = z C P u= z:

     Add those ordinary rules and you have the vector rule (11) for the divergence of uV:

      Integrating the two parts of div.uV/ gives uV ¤ n dS by the Divergence Theo-

     rem. Then one part moves to the other side, producing the minus signs in (12) and (13).

     Integration by parts leaves a boundary term, in three and two dimensions as it did½

EXAMPLE 6 Find the balance equation for flow with velocity V and fluid density
:

V is the rate of movement of fluid, while V is the rate of movement of mass.
Comparing the ocean to the atmosphere shows the difference. Air has a greater
velocity than water, but a much lower density. So normally F D V is larger for the
ocean. (Don't confuse the density  with the radial distance : The Greeks only used
24 letters.)

  There is another difference between water and air. Water is virtually incompress-
ible (meaning  D constant). Air is certainly compressible (its density varies). The
balance equation is a fundamental law--the conservation of mass or the "continuity
equation" for fluids. This is a mathematical statement about a physical flow without
sources or sinks:

                                 Continuity Equation: div.V/ C = t D 0:                       (14)

Explanation: The mass in a region is  d V: Its rate of decrease is ¡ p= t d V:

The decrease comes from flow out through the surface (normal vector n). The dot

product F ¤ n D V ¤ n is the rate of mass flow through the surface. So the integral
  F ¤ ndS is the total rate that mass goes out. By the Divergence Theorem this is

  div F d V:                     = t d V in every region, div F must equal ¡ = t at every

     15.6 Stokes' Theorem and the Curl of F

For the Divergence Theorem, the surface was closed. S was the boundary of V . Now
the surface is not closed and S has its own boundary--a curve called C . We are

back near the original setting for Green's Theorem (region bounded by curve, double

integral equal to work integral). But Stokes' Theorem, also called Stokes's Theorem,
is in three-dimensional space. There is a curved surface S bounded by a space curve
C . This is our first integral around a space curve.

  The move to three dimensions brings a change in the vector field. The plane field
F.x; y/ D M i C N j becomes a space field F.x; y; z/ D M i C N j C P k. The work
M dx C Ndy now includes P dz. The critical quantity in the double integral (it was

 N= x ¡ M= y) must change too. We called this scalar quantity "curl F," but in

reality it is only the third component of a vector. Stokes' Theorem needs all three
components of that vector--which is curl F.

DEFINITION The curl of a vector field F.x; y; z/ D M i C N j C P k is the vector

field  curl F D P ¡ N   i C M ¡ P   j C N ¡ M k: (1)
            yz        zx     xy
The symbol r ¢ F stands for a determinant that yields those six derivatives:

                   §      j  §

                   §         §

                   §M     N  P§

The three products i = y P and j = z M and k = x N have plus signs. The
three products like k = y M , down to the left, have minus signs. There is a cyclic
symmetry. This determinant helps the memory, even if it looks and is illegal. A
determinant is not supposed to have a row of vectors, a row of operators, and a row of
functions.

EXAMPLE 1 The plane field M.x; y/i C N.x; y/j has P D 0 and M= z D 0

and N= z D 0. Only two terms survive: curl F D . N= x ¡ M= y/k. Back to

Green.

EXAMPLE 2 The cross product a ¢ R is a spin field S. Its axis is the fixed vector

a D a1i C a2j C a3k. The flow in Figure 15.23 turns around a, and its components

are

Our favorite spin field ¡yi C xj has .a1; a2; a3/ D .0; 0; 1/ and its axis is a D k.

  The divergence of a spin field is Mx C Ny C Pz D 0 C 0 C 0. Note how the

divergence uses Mx while the curl uses Nx and Px. The curl of S is the vector

2a:

     yz     zx        xy

This example begins to reveal the meaning of the curl. It measures the spin! The
direction of curl F is the axis of rotation--in this case along a. The magnitude of
674                                      15 Vector Calculus

     curl F is twice the speed of rotation. In this case curl F D 2 a and the angular
     velocity is a .

     Fig. 15.23 Spin field S D a ¢ R, position field R, velocity field (shear field)V D zi, any field F.

     EXAMPLE 3 (!!) Every gradient field F D f = x i C f = y j C f = z k has
     curl F D 0:

      curl F D f ¡ f   i C f ¡ f   j C f ¡ f  k D 0: (4)
            yz zy  zx xz  xy yx

     Always fyz equals fzy. They cancel. Also fxz D fzx and fyx D fxy. So curl grad
     f D 0.

     EXAMPLE 4 (twin of Example 3) The divergence of curl F is also automatically
     zero:

      div curl F D P ¡ N   C M ¡ P   C N ¡ M  D 0:
            xy z   yz x   zx y

                                 (5)

     Again the mixed derivatives give Pxy D Pyx and Nxz D Nzx and Mzy D Myz. The

     terms cancel in pairs. In "curl grad" and "div curl", everything is arranged to give

     zero.

     15N The curl of the gradient of every f .x; y; z/ is curl grad f D r ¢ rf D 0.
        The divergence of the curl of every F.x; y; z/ is div curl F D r ¤ r ¢ F D 0.

     The spin field S has no divergence. The position field R has no curl. R is the gradient
     of f D 12 .x2 C y2 C z2/. S is the curl of a suitable F. Then div S D div curl F and
     curl R D curl grad f are automatically zero.

       You correctly believe that curl F measures the "spin" of the field. You may expect
     that curl .F C G/ is curl F C curl G. Also correct. Finally you may think that a field of
     parallel vectors has no spin. That is wrong. Example 5 has parallel vectors, but their
     different lengths produce spin.

     EXAMPLE 5 The field V D zi in the x direction has curl V D j in the y direction.

     If you put a wheel in the xz plane, this field will turn it. The velocity zi at the top of
     the wheel is greater than zi at the bottom (Figure 15.23c). So the top goes faster and
     the wheel rotates. The axis of rotation is curl V D j. The turning speed is 21 , because
     this curl has magnitude 1.

      Another velocity field v D ¡xk produces the same spin: curl v D j. The flow is in

     the z direction, it varies in the x direction, and the spin is in the y direction. Also

     interesting is V C v. The two "shear fields" add to a perfect spin field S D zi ¡ xk,

     whose curl is 2j.
                 15.6 Stokes' Theorem and the Curl of F                                             675

                             THE MEANING OF CURL F

Example 5 put a paddlewheel into the flow. This is possible for any vector field F,

and it gives insight into curl F. The turning of the wheel (if it turns) depends on its

location .x; y; z/. The turning also depends on the orientation of the wheel. We could

put it into a spin field, and if the wheel axis n is perpendicular to the spin axis a, the

wheel won't turn! The general rule for turning speed is this: the angular velocity of

the wheel is 21 .curl F/ ¤ n. This is the "directional spin," just as .grad f / ¤ u was the

"directional derivative"--and n is a unit vector like u.

There is no spin anywhere in a gradient field. It is irrotational: curl grad f D 0.
                        a¢R                                                    a¤n
The  pure  spin  field       has  curl  F  D  2a.  The  angular  velocity  is       (note  that  1
                                                                                                 2
cancels 2). This turning is everywhere, not just at the origin. If you put a penny on

a compact disk, it turns once when the disk rotates once. That spin is "around itself,"

and it is the same whether the penny is at the center or not.

  The turning speed is greatest when the wheel axis n lines up with the spin axis a.

Then a ¤ n is the full length a . The gradient gives the direction of fastest growth, and

the curl gives the direction of fastest turning:

maximum growth rate of f is grad f in the direction of grad f

maximum rotation rate of F is           1  curl F  in the direction of curl F.
                                        2

                                         STOKES' THEOREM

Finally we come to the big theorem. It will be like Green's Tòheorem--a line integral

equals a surface integral. The line integral is still the work F ¤ d R around a curve.
The surface integral in Green's Theorem is .Nx ¡ My/dx dy. The surface is flat
(in the xy plane). Its normal direction is k, and we now recognize Nx ¡ My as the

k component of the curl. Green's Theorem uses only this component because the
normal direction is always k. For Stokes' Theorem on a curved surface, we need all
three components of curl F.

  Figure 15.24 shows a hat-shaped surface S and its boundary C (a closed curve).
Walking in the positive direction around C , with your head pointing in the direction
of n, the surface is on your left. You may be standing straight up (n D k in Green's

Theorem). You may even be upside down .n D ¡k is allowed/. In that case you must

go the other way around C , to keep the two sides of equation (6) equal. The surface
is still on the left. A Möbius strip is not allowed, because its normal direction cannot
be established. The unit vector n determines the "counterclockwise direction" along
C.

The right side adds up small spins in the surface. The left side is the total circulation
(or work) around C . That is not easy to visualize--this may be thòe hardest theorem

in the book--but notice one simple conclusion. If curl F D 0 then F ¤ d R D 0. This

applies above all to gradient fields--as we know.

  A gradient field has no curl, by (4). A gradient field does no work, by (6). In three
dimensions as in two dimensions, gradient fields are conservative fields. They will
be the focus of this section, after we outline a proof (or two proofs) of Stokes' Theo-
rem.
676                         15 Vector Calculus

       The first proof shows why the theorem is true. The second proof shows that it really
     is true (and how to compute). You may prefer the first.

     First proof Figure 15.24 has a triangle ABC attached to a triangle ACD. Later there

     can be more triangles. S will be piecewise flat, close to a curved surface. Two trian-

     gles are enough to make the point. In the plane of each triangle (they have different

     n's) Green's Theorem is known:

                F ¤ d R D curl F ¤ ndS             F ¤ d R D curl F ¤ ndS:

     ABCBC CCA  AB C                    AC CCDCDA  ACD

     Now add. The right sides give ' curl F ¤ ndS over the two triangles. On the left, the

     integral over CA cancels the integral over AC . The "crosscut" disappears. That

     leaves AB C BC C CD C DA. This line integral goes around the outer boundary

     C --which is the left side of Stokes' Theorem.

     Fig. 15.24 Surfaces S and boundary curves C . Change in B curl E current in C .

     Second proof Now the surface can be curved. A new proof may seem excessive, but
     it brings formulas you could compute with. From z D f .x; y/ we have

     dz D f = x dx C f = y dy and ndS D .¡ f = x i ¡ f = y j C k/dx dy:

     For ndS , see equation 15.4.11. With this dz, the line integral in Stokes' Theorem is

     F ò ¤ d R D ò Mdx C Ndy C P . f = x dx C f = y dy/: (7)

     C          shadowof C

     The dot product of curl F and ndS gives the surface integral curl F ¤ ndS :

                                                                                                           S

     To prove (7) D (8), change M in Green's Theorem to M C P f = x. Also change N
     to N C P f = y. Then (7) D (8) is Green's Theorem down on the shadow (Problem
     47). This proves Stokes' Theorem up on S . Notice how Green's Theorem (flat surface)
     was the key to both proofs of Stokes' Theorem (curved surface).

     EXAMPLE 6 Stokes' Theorem in electricity and magnetism yields Faraday's Law.

     Stokes' Theorem is not heavily used for calculations--equation (8) shows why. But
     the spin or curl or vorticity of a flow is absolutely basic in fluid mechanics. The other
     important application, coming now, is to electric fields. Faraday's Law is to Gauss's
     Law as Stokes' Theorem is to the Divergence Theorem.

  Suppose the curve C is an actual wire. We can produce current along C by varying

the magnetic field B.t /. The flux ' D B ¤ ndS , passing within C and changing in

time, creates an electric field E that does work:

                                                                                                  ú

That is physics. It may be true, it may be an approximation. Now comes mathematics
(surely true), which turns this integral form into a differential equation. Information
at points is more convenient than information around curves. Stokes converts the line
integral of E into the surface integral of curl E:

   E ¤ d R D curl E ¤ ndS and also ¡ '= t D ¡. B= t/ ¤ ndS:

C  S  S

These are equal for any curve C , however small. So the right sides are equal for
any surface S . We squeeze to a point. The right hand sides give one of Maxwell's

equations: Faraday's Law(differential form): curl E D ¡ B= t:

                CONSERVATIVE FIELDS AND POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS

The chapter ends with our constant and important question: Which fields do no work
around closed curves? Remember test D for plane curves and plane vector fields:

                                                                                                                                    ú

 if M= y D N= x then F is conservative and F D grad f and F ¤ d R D 0:

Now allow a three-dimensional field like F D 2xy i C .x2 C z/j C yk. Does it do

work around a space curve? Or is it a gradient field? That will require f = x D 2xy
and f = y D x2 C z and f = z D y. We have three equations for one function

f .x; y; z/. Normally they can't be solved. When test D is passed (now it is the three-

dimensional test: curl F D 0) they can be solved. This example passes test D, and f
is x2y C yz.

  15P F.x; y; z/ D M i C N j C P k is a conservative field if it has these properties:

   A. The work ò F ¤ d R around every closed path in space is zero.
   B. The work PQ F ¤ d R depends on P and Q, not on the path in space.

    C. F is a gradient field: M D f = x and N D f = y and P D f = z.
    D. The components satisfy My D Nx; Mz D Px, and Nz D Py (curl F is zero).
  A field with one of these properties has them all. D is the quick test.

A detailed proof of A B C D A is not needed. Only notice òhow C D:

curl grad F is always zero. The newest part is D A. If curl F D 0 then F ¤ d R D 0.

But that is not news. It is Stokes' Theorem.
  The interesting problem is to solve the three equations for f , when test D is passed.

The example above had

        f = x D 2xy f D 2xy dx D x2y plus any function C.y; z/
        f = y D x2 C z D x2 C C = y C D yz plus any function c.z/
        f = z D y D y C dc=dz c.z/ can be zero.
678                          15 Vector Calculus

     The first step leaves an arbitrary C.y; z/ to fix the second step. The second step leaves
     an arbitrary c.z/ to fix the third step (not needed here). Assembling the three steps,
     f D x2y C C D x2y C yz C c D x2y C yz. Please recognize that the "fix-up" is only
     possible when curl F D 0. Test D must be passed.

     EXAMPLE 7 Is F D .z ¡ y/i C .x ¡ z/j C .y ¡ x/k the gradient of any f ?
     Test D says no. This F is a spin field a ¢ R. Its curl is 2a D .2; 2; 2/, which is not
     zero. A search for f is bound to fail, but we can try. To match f = x D z ¡ y, we
     must have f D zx ¡ yx C C.y; z/. The y derivative is ¡x C C= y: That never
     matches N D x ¡ z, so f can't exist.

     EXAMPLE 8 What choice of P makes F D yz2i C xz2j C P k conservative? Find
     f.

     Solution We need curl F D 0, by test D. First check M= y D z2 D N= x. Also

                   P = x D M= z D 2yz and P = y D N= z D 2xz:

     P D 2xyz passes all tests. To find f we can solve the three equations, or notice that
     f D xyz2 is successful. Its gradient is F.

       A third method defines f .x; y; z/ as the work to reach .x; y; z/ from .0; 0; 0/.

     The path doesn't matter. For practice we integrate F ¤ d R D M dx C Ndy C P dz along

     the straight line .xt; yt; zt /:

                           ÷1

                             0

     EXAMPLE 9 Why is div curl grad f automatically zero (in two ways)?

     Solution First, curl grad f is zero (always). Second, div curl F is zero (always).
     Those are the key identities of vector calculus. We end with a review.

      The first form of Green's Theorem leads to Stokes' Theorem. The second form
     becomes the Divergence Theorem. You may ask, why not go to three dimensions
     in the first place? The last two theorems contain the first two (take P D 0 and a flat
     surface). We could have reduced this chapter to two theorems, not four. I admit that,
     but a fundamental principle is involved: "It is easier to generalize than to specialize."

       For the same reason df =dx came before partial derivatives and the gradient.

Mathematics after Calculus

I would like this book to do more than help you pass calculus. (I hope it does that too.)  681
After calculus you will have choices--Which mathematics course to take next ? --
and these pages aim to serve as a guide. Part of the answer depends on where you are
going--toward engineering or management or teaching or science or another career
where mathematics plays a part. The rest of the answer depends on where the courses
are going. This chapter can be a useful reference, to give a clearer idea than course
titles can do:

        Linear Algebra Differential Equations Discrete Mathematics

  Advanced Calculus (with Fourier Series) Numerical Methods Statistics

Pure mathematics is often divided into analysis and algebra and geometry. Those
parts come together in the "mathematical way of thinking"--a mixture of logic
and ideas. It is a deep and creative subject--here we make a start.

  Two main courses after calculus are linear algebra and differential equations. I
hope you can take both. To help you later, Sections 16:1 and 16:2 organize them by
examples. First a few words to compare and contrast those two subjects.

  Linear algebra is about systems of equations. There are n variables to solve for.
A change in one affects the others. They can be prices or velocities or currents or
concentrations--outputs from any model with interconnected parts.

  Linear algebra makes only one assumption--the model must be linear. A change
in one variable produces proportional changes in all variables. Practically every
subject begins that way. (When it becomes nonlinear, we solve by a sequence of linear
equations. Linear programming is nonlinear because we require x 0:) Elsewhere I
wrote that "Linear algebra has become as basic and as applicable as calculus, and
fortunately it is easier." I recommend taking it.

  A differential equation is continuous (from calculus), where a matrix equation is
discrete (from algebra). The rate dy=dt is determined by the present state y--which

changes by following that rule. Section 16:2 solves y½ D cy C s.t / for economics and
life sciences, and y¾ C by½ C cy D f .t / for physics and engineering. Please keep it

and refer to it.
682                16 Mathematics after Calculus

       A third key direction is discrete mathematics. Matrices are a part, networks and
     algorithms are a bigger part. Derivatives are not a part--this is closer to algebra. It
     is needed in computer science. Some people have a knack for counting the ways a
     computer can send ten messages in parallel--and for finding the fastest way.

       Typical question: Can 25 states be matched with 25 neighbors, so one state
     in each pair has an even number of letters ? New York can pair with New Jersey,
     Texas with Oklahoma, California with Arizona. We need rules for Hawaii and Alaska.
     This matching question doesn't sound mathematical, but it is.

       Section 16:3 selects four topics from discrete mathematics, so you can decide if
     you want more.

       Go back for a moment to calculus and differential equations. A completely realistic
     problem is seldom easy, but we can solve models. (Developing a good model is a skill
     in itself.) One method of solution involves complex numbers:

     any function  u.x C iy/   solves   uxx C uyy D 0   (Laplace equation)
     any function  ei k.xCct/  solves                   (wave equation):
                                       utt ¡ c2uxx D 0

     From those building blocks we assemble solutions. For the wave equation, a signal
     starts at t D 0: It is a combination of pure oscillations eikx: The coefficients in that

     combination make up the Fourier transform--to tell how much of each frequency

     is in the signal. A lot of engineers and scientists would rather know those Fourier
     coefficients than f .x/:

       A Fourier series breaks the signal into  ak cos kx or  bk sin kx or  ckeikx:
     These sums can be infinite (like power series). Instead of values of f .x/; or
     derivatives at the basepoint, the function is described by ak; bk; ck: Everything is
     computed by the "Fast Fourier Transform." This is the greatest algorithm since

     Newton's method.

       A radio signal is near one frequency. A step function has many frequencies. A delta
     function has every frequency in the same amount: i.x/ D  cos kx: Channel 4 can't

     broadcast a perfect step function. You wouldn't want to hear a delta function.

       We mentioned computing. For nonlinear equations this means Newton's method.
     For Ax D b it means elimination--algorithms take the place of formulas. Exact
     solutions are gone--speed and accuracy and stability become essential. It seems right
     to make scientific computing a part of applied mathematics, and teach the algorithms
     with the theory. My text Introduction to Applied Mathematics is one step in this
     direction, trying to present advanced calculus as it is actually used.

       We cannot discuss applications and forget statistics. Our society produces oceans
     of data--somebody has to draw conclusions. To decide if a new drug works, and
     if oil spills are common or rare, and how often to have a checkup, we can't just
     guess. I am astounded that the connection between smoking and health was hidden
     for centuries. It was in the data! Eventually the statisticians uncovered it. Professionals
     can find patterns, and the rest of us can understand (with a little mathematics) what
     has been found.

       One purpose in studying mathematics is to know more about your own life.
     Calculus lights up a key idea: Functions. Shapes and populations and heart signals
     and profits and growth rates, all are given by functions. They change in time. They
     have integrals and derivatives. To understand and use them is a challenge--
     mathematics takes effort. A lot of people have contributed, in whatever way they
     could--as you and I are doing. We may not be Newton or Leibniz or Gauss or
     Einstein, but we can share some part of what they created.
