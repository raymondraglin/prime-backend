                        5.1: Apportionment

Apportionment is the problem of dividing up a fixed number of people or items among
groups of different sizes. For example, we use apportionment to determine the number of
representatives for each state in the US House of Representatives, or to divide school busses
among districts.

Rules of Apportionment

1. The people/items can only be divided into                                                   .

2. We must use the                            of people/items being divided.

3. Each group must get                        of the people/items being divided up.

4. The number of people/items assigned to each group should be                             to

the size of the group. (Exact is rarely possible so get as close as possible).

Apportionment Methods and Steps

1. Divide the total population by the number of items to find the divisor: The number of
people each person should represent (decimal).

2. Divide the population of each group by the divisor to get the standard quota.

Hamilton's Method (vetoed in 1792, used from 1850-1900): Cut off decimal to find
the initial number. Then give any extra seats in order of the highest decimal remainders.

Jefferson's Method (used from 1792-1830): Cut off the decimal to find the initial
number. Lower the divisor if needed so that there are no leftover seats. Uses trial and
error.

Webster's Method (used in 1840): Instead of cutting off the decimal, round it to find the
initial number. Then raise or lower the divisor if needed so there are no leftover seats.

Hill-Huntington Method (used 1941-present): Instead of rounding using 0.5 or higher,

use the geometric mean ( + 1) to round the initial number. Then raise or lower the
divisor if needed so there are no leftover seats.

It is important to acknowledge slavery in the U. S. when these methods were formed. In the
textbook I encourage you to read about the 3/5 Compromise and Hamilton, Jefferson and
Webster's relationship to slavery. In the 3/5 compromise, only 3/5 of the slave population was
counted for representation. When the slaves were freed in 1863, they were counted as whole
people. Black men were given the right to vote in 1869 and all women in 1920, however,
there are still voter suppression measures for black people and other minoritized groups.

It is important to acknowledge this history and the racism that continues today so those with
privileges can use them to work toward removing systemic oppression.

Example 1. PCC has four campuses and 45 full-time math instructors. The number of
students at each campus is given in terms of full-time equivalency (FTE). How can we divide
up the math instructors fairly?

Personal Reflection:
Do you think the U.S. presidential election system is fair? Explain why or why not.

Voting Methods

Ranked Choice Voting and the Preference Schedule

Example 1. Students are voting for their class president and the candidates are Omar (O),
Ann (A), and Helen (H). They have ranked the candidates according to their preference.

            Vien Ann Marv Tasha Eve          Omar  Lupe  Dave  Helena                Jimmy
                                             O     H     O     H                     A
