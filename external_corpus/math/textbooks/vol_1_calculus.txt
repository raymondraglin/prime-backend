About Calculus Volume 1

Calculus is designed for the typical two- or three-semester general calculus
course, incorporating innovative features to enhance student learning. The
book guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them
understand how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around
them. Due to the comprehensive nature of the material, we are offering the
book in three volumes for flexibility and efficiency. Volume 1 covers
functions, limits, derivatives, and integration.

Coverage and scope
Our Calculus Volume 1 textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most
general calculus courses nationwide. We have worked to make calculus
interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the mathematical
rigor inherent in the subject. With this objective in mind, the content of the
three volumes of Calculus have been developed and arranged to provide a
logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts, building
upon what students have already learned and emphasizing connections
between topics and between theory and applications. The goal of each
section is to enable students not just to recognize concepts, but work with
them in ways that will be useful in later courses and future careers. The
organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with
feedback from mathematics educators dedicated to the project.

Pedagogical foundation

Throughout Calculus Volume 1 you will find examples and exercises that
present classical ideas and techniques as well as modern applications and
methods. Derivations and explanations are based on years of classroom
experience on the part of long-time calculus professors, striving for a
balance of clarity and rigor that has proven successful with their students.
Motivational applications cover important topics in probability, biology,
ecology, business, and economics, as well as areas of physics, chemistry,
engineering, and computer science. Student Projects in each chapter give
students opportunities to explore interesting sidelights in pure and applied
mathematics, from determining a safe distance between the grandstand and
the track at a Formula One racetrack, to calculating the center of mass of
the Grand Canyon Skywalk or the terminal speed of a skydiver. Chapter
Opening Applications pose problems that are solved later in the chapter,
using the ideas covered in that chapter. Problems include the hydraulic
force against the Hoover Dam, and the comparison of relative intensity of
two earthquakes. Definitions, Rules, and Theorems are highlighted
throughout the text, including over 60 Proofs of theorems.

Assessments that reinforce key concepts

In-chapter Examples walk students through problems by posing a question,
stepping out a solution, and then asking students to practice the skill with a
"Checkpoint" question. The book also includes assessments at the end of
each chapter so students can apply what they've learned through practice
problems. Many exercises are marked with a [T] to indicate they are
suitable for solution by technology, including calculators or Computer
Algebra Systems (CAS). Answers for selected exercises are available in the
Answer Key at the back of the book. The book also includes assessments at
the end of each chapter so students can apply what they've learned through
practice problems.

Early or late transcendentals

Calculus Volume 1 is designed to accommodate both Early and Late
Transcendental approaches to calculus. Exponential and logarithmic
functions are introduced informally in Chapter 1 and presented in more
rigorous terms in Chapter 6. Differentiation and integration of these
functions is covered in Chapters 3-5 for instructors who want to include
them with other types of functions. These discussions, however, are in
separate sections that can be skipped for instructors who prefer to wait until
the integral definitions are given before teaching the calculus derivations of
exponentials and logarithms.

Comprehensive art program

Our art program is designed to enhance students' understanding of concepts
through clear and effective illustrations, diagrams, and photographs.

    A portion of
       the San

   Andreas Fault
   in California.
    Major faults
    like this are

     the sites of
    most of the

    earthquakes

         ever
     recorded.

In the past few years, major earthquakes have occurred in several countries
around the world. In January 2010, an earthquake of magnitude 7.3 hit
Haiti. A magnitude 9 earthquake shook northeastern Japan in March 2011.
In April 2014, an 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northern
Chile. What do these numbers mean? In particular, how does a magnitude 9
earthquake compare with an earthquake of magnitude 8.2? Or 7.3? Later in
this chapter, we show how logarithmic functions are used to compare the
relative intensity of two earthquakes based on the magnitude of each
earthquake (see [link]).

Calculus is the mathematics that describes changes in functions. In this
chapter, we review all the functions necessary to study calculus. We define
polynomial, rational, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions.
We review how to evaluate these functions, and we show the properties of
their graphs. We provide examples of equations with terms involving these
functions and illustrate the algebraic techniques necessary to solve them. In
short, this chapter provides the foundation for the material to come. It is
essential to be familiar and comfortable with these ideas before proceeding
to the formal introduction of calculus in the next chapter.
Review of Functions

      Use functional notation to evaluate a function.
      Determine the domain and range of a function.
      Draw the graph of a function.
      Find the zeros of a function.
      Recognize a function from a table of values.
      Make new functions from two or more given functions.
      Describe the symmetry properties of a function.

In this section, we provide a formal definition of a function and examine several ways in
which functions are represented--namely, through tables, formulas, and graphs. We
study formal notation and terms related to functions. We also define composition of
functions and symmetry properties. Most of this material will be a review for you, but it
serves as a handy reference to remind you of some of the algebraic techniques useful for
working with functions.

Functions

Given two sets A and B, a set with elements that are ordered pairs (x, y), where x is an
element of A and y is an element of B, is a relation from A to B. A relation from A to
B defines a relationship between those two sets. A function is a special type of relation
in which each element of the first set is related to exactly one element of the second set.
The element of the first set is called the input; the element of the second set is called the
output. Functions are used all the time in mathematics to describe relationships between
two sets. For any function, when we know the input, the output is determined, so we say
that the output is a function of the input. For example, the area of a square is determined
by its side length, so we say that the area (the output) is a function of its side length (the
input). The velocity of a ball thrown in the air can be described as a function of the
amount of time the ball is in the air. The cost of mailing a package is a function of the
weight of the package. Since functions have so many uses, it is important to have precise
definitions and terminology to study them.

Note:
Definition
A function f consists of a set of inputs, a set of outputs, and a rule for assigning each
input to exactly one output. The set of inputs is called the domain of the function. The
set of outputs is called the range of the function.
For example, consider the function f, where the domain is the set of all real numbers

and the rule is to square the input. Then, the input x = 3 is assigned to the output

    2  =  9.  Since  every  nonnegative  real  number   has    a  real-value  square  root,  every

3

nonnegative number is an element of the range of this function. Since there is no real

number with a square that is negative, the negative real numbers are not elements of the

range. We conclude that the range is the set of nonnegative real numbers.

For a general function f with domain D, we often use x to denote the input and y to

denote the output associated with x. When doing so, we refer to x as the independent

variable and y as the dependent variable, because it depends on x. Using function

notation, we write y = f(x), and we read this equation as "y equals f of x. " For the

squaring      function  described  earlier,  we  write  f (x)  =       2

                                                                  x.

The concept of a function can be visualized using [link], [link], and [link].

       A function can be visualized as an
               input/output device.

       A function maps every element in
       the domain to exactly one element
       in the range. Although each input
       can be sent to only one output, two
    different inputs can be sent to the
                same output.

    In this case, a graph of a function
    f has a domain of {1, 2, 3} and a
    range of {1, 2}. The independent
     variable is x and the dependent

                variable is y.

Note:
Visit this applet link to see more about graphs of functions.

We can also visualize a function by plotting points (x, y) in the coordinate plane where
y = f(x). The graph of a function is the set of all these points. For example, consider
the function f, where the domain is the set D = {1, 2, 3} and the rule is f(x) = 3 - x.
In [link], we plot a graph of this function.
Here we see a graph of the
 function f with domain
     {1, 2, 3} and rule
f(x) = 3 - x. The graph
   consists of the points
(x, f (x)) for all x in the
           domain.

Every function has a domain. However, sometimes a function is described by an

equation, as in f(x) = x2, with no specific domain given. In this case, the domain is

taken to be the set of all real numbers x for which f(x) is a real number. For example,

since any real number can be squared, if no other domain is specified, we consider the

domain    of  f (x)  =       2  to  be  the  set  of  all  real  numbers.  On  the  other  hand,  the  square

                        x

root function f(x) = x only gives a real output if x is nonnegative. Therefore, the

domain of the function f (x) = x is the set of nonnegative real numbers, sometimes

called the natural domain.

For  the  functions  f (x)      =        2  and  f (x)  =  x,    the  domains  are  sets   with  an  infinite

                                    x

number of elements. Clearly we cannot list all these elements. When describing a set

with an infinite number of elements, it is often helpful to use set-builder or interval

notation. When using set-builder notation to describe a subset of all real numbers,

denoted R, we write

Equation:

                                            {x|x has some property}.

We read this as the set of real numbers x such that x has some property. For example, if
we were interested in the set of real numbers that are greater than one but less than five,
we could denote this set using set-builder notation by writing
Equation:

                                                                                    {x|1 < x < 5}.

A set such as this, which contains all numbers greater than a and less than b, can also be
denoted using the interval notation (a, b). Therefore,
Equation:

                                                                          (1, 5) = {x|1 < x < 5}.

The numbers 1 and 5 are called the endpoints of this set. If we want to consider the set
that includes the endpoints, we would denote this set by writing
Equation:

                                                                          [1, 5] = {x|1  x  5}.

We can use similar notation if we want to include one of the endpoints, but not the other.
To denote the set of nonnegative real numbers, we would use the set-builder notation
Equation:

                                                                                          {x|0  x}.

The smallest number in this set is zero, but this set does not have a largest number. Using
interval notation, we would use the symbol , which refers to positive infinity, and we
would write the set as
Equation:

                                                                              [0, ) = {x|0  x}.

It is important to note that  is not a real number. It is used symbolically here to
indicate that this set includes all real numbers greater than or equal to zero. Similarly, if
we wanted to describe the set of all nonpositive numbers, we could write
Equation:

                                                                            (-, 0] = {x|x  0}.

Here, the notation - refers to negative infinity, and it indicates that we are including
all numbers less than or equal to zero, no matter how small. The set
Equation:
                             (-, ) = {x|x is any real number}

refers to the set of all real numbers.

Some functions are defined using different equations for different parts of their domain.

These types of functions are known as piecewise-defined functions. For example,

suppose we want to define a function f with a domain that is the set of all real numbers

such  that  f (x)  =  3x  +  1  for  x         2  and  f (x)  =                     2  for  x  <  2.  We  denote  this  function

                                                                               x

by writing

Equation:

                                                             3x + 1             x2
                                                                                               .
                                     f (x) = {
                                                                               x<2
                                                                            2

                                                             x

When evaluating this function for an input x, the equation to use depends on whether
x  2 or x < 2. For example, since 5 > 2, we use the fact that f(x) = 3x + 1 for
x  2 and see that f(5) = 3(5) + 1 = 16. On the other hand, for x = -1, we use the
fact that f(x) = x2 for x < 2 and see that f(-1) = 1.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Evaluating Functions

For   the   function  f   (x)   =           2  +  2x  -  1,  evaluate

                                   3x

      a. f (-2)
      b. f (2)
      c. f(a + h)

Solution:

Substitute the given value for x in the formula for f(x).

   a. f (-2) = 3(-2) + 2 (-2) - 1 = 12 - 4 - 1 = 7 2

                                                                                  2

   b. f (2) = 3(2) + 22 - 1 = 6 + 22 - 1 = 5 + 22

   Problem:
   Finding Domain and Range
   For each of the following functions, determine the i. domain and ii. range.

      a. f (x) = (x - 4) + 5 2
      b. f (x) = 3x + 2 - 1
      c. f (x) = 3

                                                      x-2

   Solution:
      a. Consider f (x) = (x - 4) + 5. 2

            i. Since f(x) = (x - 4) + 5 2 is a real number for any real number x, the
               domain of f is the interval (-, ).

            ii. Since (x - 4)  0, 2 we know f (x) = (x - 4) + 5  5. 2 Therefore,
               the range must be a subset of {y|y  5}. To show that every element in
         this set is in the range, we need to show that for a given y in that set,
         there is a real number x such that f(x) = (x - 4) + 5 = y. 2 Solving
         this equation for x, we see that we need x such that
         Equation:

                                                                                                                                             2

                                                                                (x - 4) = y - 5.

         This equation is satisfied as long as there exists a real number x such that
         Equation:

                                                                               x - 4 = ±y - 5.

         Since y  5, the square root is well-defined. We conclude that for
         x = 4 ± y - 5, f(x) = y, and therefore the range is {y|y  5}.

b. Consider f (x) = 3x + 2 - 1.

      i. To find the domain of f, we need the expression 3x + 2  0. Solving
         this inequality, we conclude that the domain is {x|x  -2/3}.

     ii. To find the range of f, we note that since
         3x + 2  0, f (x) = 3x + 2 - 1  -1. Therefore, the range of f
         must be a subset of the set {y|y  -1}. To show that every element in
         this set is in the range of f, we need to show that for all y in this set,
         there exists a real number x in the domain such that f(x) = y. Let
         y  -1. Then, f(x) = y if and only if
         Equation:

                                                                                3x + 2 - 1 = y.

         Solving this equation for x, we see that x must solve the equation
         Equation:

                                                                                3x + 2 = y + 1.

         Since y  -1, such an x could exist. Squaring both sides of this
         equation, we have 3x + 2 = (y + 1) . 2
         Therefore, we need
         Equation:
                                                                              2

                                3x = (y + 1) - 2,

which implies
Equation:

                                    1           2  2
                                                       .
                                x=     (y + 1) -
                                                   3
                                    3

We just need to verify that x is in the domain of f. Since the domain of f
consists of all real numbers greater than or equal to -2/3, and
Equation:

               1                       2     2                                   2

                                (y + 1) -          - ,

               3                             3                                   3

there does exist an x in the domain of f. We conclude that the range of f
is {y|y  -1}.

c. Consider f (x) = 3/(x - 2).

i. Since 3/(x - 2) is defined when the denominator is nonzero, the
   domain is {x|x  2}.

ii. To find the range of f, we need to find the values of y such that there
   exists a real number x in the domain with the property that
   Equation:

                                         3   = y.
                                    x-2

Solving this equation for x, we find that
Equation:

                                          3

                                    x=       + 2.

                                          y

Therefore, as long as y  0, there exists a real number x in the domain
such that f(x) = y. Thus, the range is {y|y  0}.
Note:
Exercise:

   Problem: Find the domain and range for f (x) = 4 - 2x + 5.

   Solution:
   Domain = {x|x  2}, range = {y|y  5}
Hint
Use 4 - 2x  0.

Representing Functions

Typically, a function is represented using one or more of the following tools:
      A table
      A graph
      A formula

We can identify a function in each form, but we can also use them together. For instance,
we can plot on a graph the values from a table or create a table from a formula.

Tables
Functions described using a table of values arise frequently in real-world applications.
Consider the following simple example. We can describe temperature on a given day as
a function of time of day. Suppose we record the temperature every hour for a 24-hour
period starting at midnight. We let our input variable x be the time after midnight,
measured in hours, and the output variable y be the temperature x hours after midnight,
measured in degrees Fahrenheit. We record our data in [link].

Hours after  Temperature  Hours after  Temperature
Midnight                  Midnight
             (°F)                      (°F)

Temperature as a Function of Time of Day

We can see from the table that temperature is a function of time, and the temperature
decreases, then increases, and then decreases again. However, we cannot get a clear
picture of the behavior of the function without graphing it.

Graphs

Given a function f described by a table, we can provide a visual picture of the function
in the form of a graph. Graphing the temperatures listed in [link] can give us a better
idea of their fluctuation throughout the day. [link] shows the plot of the temperature
function.
    The graph of the data from [link]
   shows temperature as a function of

                     time.

From the points plotted on the graph in [link], we can visualize the general shape of the
graph. It is often useful to connect the dots in the graph, which represent the data from
the table. In this example, although we cannot make any definitive conclusion regarding
what the temperature was at any time for which the temperature was not recorded, given
the number of data points collected and the pattern in these points, it is reasonable to
suspect that the temperatures at other times followed a similar pattern, as we can see in
[link].
Connecting the dots in [link] shows
   the general pattern of the data.

Algebraic Formulas

Sometimes we are not given the values of a function in table form, rather we are given

the values in an explicit formula. Formulas arise in many applications. For example, the

area  of  a  circle  of  radius  r  is  given  by  the  formula  A  (r)  =           2  When  an  object  is

                                                                            r .

thrown upward from the ground with an initial velocity v0 ft/s, its height above the

ground from the time it is thrown until it hits the ground is given by the formula

s (t) = -16t2 + v0t. When P dollars are invested in an account at an annual interest

rate r compounded continuously, the amount of money after t years is given by the

formula A (t) = P ert. Algebraic formulas are important tools to calculate function

values. Often we also represent these functions visually in graph form.

Given an algebraic formula for a function f, the graph of f is the set of points
(x, f (x)), where x is in the domain of f and f(x) is in the range. To graph a function
given by a formula, it is helpful to begin by using the formula to create a table of inputs
and outputs. If the domain of f consists of an infinite number of values, we cannot list
all of them, but because listing some of the inputs and outputs can be very useful, it is
often a good way to begin.

When creating a table of inputs and outputs, we typically check to determine whether

zero is an output. Those values of x where f (x) = 0 are called the zeros of a function.

For  example,  the  zeros  of  f  (x)  =       2  -  4  are  x  =  ±2.  The  zeros  determine  where  the

                                          x

graph of f intersects the x-axis, which gives us more information about the shape of the

graph of the function. The graph of a function may never intersect the x-axis, or it may

intersect multiple (or even infinitely many) times.

Another point of interest is the y-intercept, if it exists. The y-intercept is given by

(0, f (0)).

Since a function has exactly one output for each input, the graph of a function can have,
at most, one y-intercept. If x = 0 is in the domain of a function f, then f has exactly
one y-intercept. If x = 0 is not in the domain of f, then f has no y-intercept. Similarly,
for any real number c, if c is in the domain of f, there is exactly one output f (c), and
the line x = c intersects the graph of f exactly once. On the other hand, if c is not in the
domain of f, f(c) is not defined and the line x = c does not intersect the graph of f.
This property is summarized in the vertical line test.

Note:
Rule: Vertical Line Test
Given a function f, every vertical line that may be drawn intersects the graph of f no
more than once. If any vertical line intersects a set of points more than once, the set of
points does not represent a function.

We can use this test to determine whether a set of plotted points represents the graph of a
function ([link]).
    (a) The set of plotted points represents the graph of a
  function because every vertical line intersects the set of
   points, at most, once. (b) The set of plotted points does

     not represent the graph of a function because some
   vertical lines intersect the set of points more than once.

      a. Find all zeros of f.
      b. Find the y-intercept (if any).
      c. Sketch a graph of f.

   Solution:
      a. To find the zeros, solve f(x) = -4x + 2 = 0. We discover that f has one
         zero at x = 1/2.

      b. The y-intercept is given by (0, f (0)) = (0, 2).
      c. Given that f is a linear function of the form f (x) = mx + b that passes

         through the points (1/2, 0) and (0, 2), we can sketch the graph of f ([link]).

            The function f(x) = -4x + 2 is a
                            line with

                 x-intercept (1/2, 0) and y-
                        intercept (0, 2).

      a. Find all zeros of f.
      b. Find the y-intercept (if any).
      c. Sketch a graph of f.
   Solution:
a. To find the zeros, solve x + 3 + 1 = 0. This equation implies
  x + 3 = -1. Since x + 3  0 for all x, this equation has no solutions,
  and therefore f has no zeros.

b. The y-intercept is given by (0, f (0)) = (0, 3 + 1).
c. To graph this function, we make a table of values. Since we need x + 3  0,

  we need to choose values of x  -3. We choose values that make the square-
  root function easy to evaluate.

x      -3                                 -2  1
f (x)
       1                                  2   3

Making use of the table and knowing that, since the function is a square root, the
graph of f should be similar to the graph of y = x, we sketch the graph ([link]).

                   The graph of
          f(x) = x + 3 + 1 has a

   Finding the Height of a Free-Falling Object

If a ball is dropped from a height of 100 ft, its height s at time t is given by the

function  s  (t)  =                    2  +  100,  where  s  is  measured  in  feet  and  t  is  measured  in

Note that for this function and the function f (x) = -4x + 2 graphed in [link], the
values of f(x) are getting smaller as x is getting larger. A function with this property is
said to be decreasing. On the other hand, for the function f (x) = x + 3 + 1 graphed
in [link], the values of f(x) are getting larger as the values of x are getting larger. A
function with this property is said to be increasing. It is important to note, however, that
a function can be increasing on some interval or intervals and decreasing over a different
interval or intervals. For example, using our temperature function in [link], we can see
that the function is decreasing on the interval (0, 4), increasing on the interval (4, 14),
and then decreasing on the interval (14, 23). We make the idea of a function increasing
or decreasing over a particular interval more precise in the next definition.

Combining Functions

Now that we have reviewed the basic characteristics of functions, we can see what
happens to these properties when we combine functions in different ways, using basic
mathematical operations to create new functions. For example, if the cost for a company
to manufacture x items is described by the function C(x) and the revenue created by the
sale of x items is described by the function R (x), then the profit on the manufacture and
sale of x items is defined as P (x) = R (x) - C (x). Using the difference between two
functions, we created a new function.
Alternatively, we can create a new function by composing two functions. For example,
given the functions f (x) = x2 and g (x) = 3x + 1, the composite function f  g is
defined such that
Equation:

                                 2                                2

(f  g) (x) = f (g (x)) = (g (x)) = (3x + 1) .

The composite function g  f is defined such that
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2

                                            (g  f ) (x) = g (f (x)) = 3f (x) + 1 = 3x + 1.

Note that these two new functions are different from each other.

Combining Functions with Mathematical Operators

To combine functions using mathematical operators, we simply write the functions with
the operator and simplify. Given two functions f and g, we can define four new
functions:
Equation:

(f + g) (x) = f (x) + g (x)         Sum
                                    Dif f erence
(f - g) (x) = f (x) - g (x)         P roduct
                                    Quotient
(f  g) (x) = f (x)g (x)

      f    f (x)  f or g (x)  0
           g(x)
( ) (x) =

       g

   following functions and state its domain.

      function is the interval (-, ).

   b. (f - g) (x) = (2x - 3) - (x2 - 1) = -x2 + 2x - 2. The domain of this

Hint

The new function (f/g) (x) is a quotient of two functions. For what values of x is the
denominator zero?

Function Composition

When we compose functions, we take a function of a function. For example, suppose the
temperature T on a given day is described as a function of time t (measured in hours
after midnight) as in [link]. Suppose the cost C, to heat or cool a building for 1 hour, can
be described as a function of the temperature T . Combining these two functions, we can
describe the cost of heating or cooling a building as a function of time by evaluating
C (T (t)). We have defined a new function, denoted C  T , which is defined such that
(C  T ) (t) = C(T (t)) for all t in the domain of T . This new function is called a
composite function. We note that since cost is a function of temperature and temperature
is a function of time, it makes sense to define this new function (C  T )(t). It does not
make sense to consider (T  C)(t), because temperature is not a function of cost.

Note:
Definition
Consider the function f with domain A and range B, and the function g with domain D
and range E. If B is a subset of D, then the composite function (g  f)(x) is the
function with domain A such that
Equation:

                                                                           (g  f ) (x) = g (f (x)).

A composite function g  f can be viewed in two steps. First, the function f maps each
input x in the domain of f to its output f(x) in the range of f. Second, since the range
of f is a subset of the domain of g, the output f(x) is an element in the domain of g, and
therefore it is mapped to an output g (f (x)) in the range of g. In [link], we see a visual
image of a composite function.

       For the composite function g  f, we have
          (g  f ) (1) = 4, (g  f ) (2) = 5, and

                                            (g  f ) (3) = 4.

   Compositions of Functions Defined by Formulas

   Consider the functions f(x) = x2 + 1 and g(x) = 1/x.

      a. Find (g  f)(x) and state its domain and range.
      b. Evaluate (g  f)(4), (g  f)(-1/2).
      c. Find (f  g)(x) and state its domain and range.
      d. Evaluate (f  g)(4), (f  g)(-1/2).

Solution:

a. We can find the formula for (g  f)(x) in two different ways. We could write
  Equation:

                                                                                                                                   2        1

                                  (g  f )(x) = g(f (x)) = g(x + 1) =                                                                                   .
                                                                                                                                      x2 + 1

Alternatively, we could write
Equation:

                                                                                      1                                               1

                                      (g  f )(x) = g (f (x)) =                              =                                                 .

                                                                                   f (x)       x2 + 1

Since           2  +           1      0  for  all  real  numbers  x,  the             domain   of                                     (g      f )(x)         is  the  set

           x

of all real numbers. Since 0 < 1/(x2 + 1)  1, the range is, at most, the

interval (0, 1]. To show that the range is this entire interval, we let

y  =                        2  +  1)  and  solve   this    equation   for          x  to  show                                        that  for  all      y  in  the

           1/(x

interval (0, 1], there exists a real number x such that y = 1/(x2 + 1).

Solving    this                equation       for  x,  we  see  that       2       +  1  =  1/y,                                      which      implies         that

                                                                      x

Equation:

                                                                                1  - 1.
                                                         x = ±

                                                                                y

If y is in the interval (0, 1], the expression under the radical is nonnegative,
and therefore there exists a real number x such that 1/(x2 + 1) = y. We

  conclude that the range of g  f is the interval (0, 1].

c. We can find a formula for (f  g)(x) in two ways. First, we could write
  Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                   2

                                  1                                                                                                                                          1

   (f  g)(x) = f (g(x)) = f ( ) = ( ) + 1.

Alternatively, we could write
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                      2

                                  2                                                                                                                                             1

(f  g)(x) = f (g(x)) = (g(x)) + 1 = ( ) + 1.

                                                                                                                                                                                x

The domain of f  g is the set of all real numbers x such that x  0. To find
the range of f, we need to find all values y for which there exists a real
number x  0 such that
Equation:

                                                                                                                          2

                                                                             1
                                                                      ( ) + 1 = y.

                                                                            x

Solving this equation for x, we see that we need x to satisfy
Equation:

                                                                                                                          2

                                                                             1
                                                                      ( ) = y - 1,

                                                                            x

which simplifies to            1
Equation:                            = ±y - 1.

Finally, we obtain             x
Equation:

                           1

                      x=±         .

                           y - 1

Since 1/y - 1 is a real number if and only if y > 1, the range of f is the

set {y|y > 1}.

   Problem:
   Application Involving a Composite Function
   A store is advertising a sale of 20% off all merchandise. Caroline has a coupon
   that entitles her to an additional 15% off any item, including sale merchandise. If
   Caroline decides to purchase an item with an original price of x dollars, how much
   will she end up paying if she applies her coupon to the sale price? Solve this
   problem by using a composite function.

   Solution:

   Since the sale price is 20% off the original price, if an item is x dollars, its sale
   price is given by f (x) = 0.80x. Since the coupon entitles an individual to 15%
   off the price of any item, if an item is y dollars, the price, after applying the
   coupon, is given by g(y) = 0.85y. Therefore, if the price is originally x dollars, its
   sale price will be f(x) = 0.80x and then its final price after the coupon will be

      g(f (x)) = 0.85(0.80x) = 0.68x.

Note:

   Problem:

   If items are on sale for 10% off their original price, and a customer has a coupon
   for an additional 30% off, what will be the final price for an item that is originally
   x dollars, after applying the coupon to the sale price?

   Solution:

      (g  f )(x) = 0.63x

Hint

The sale price of an item with an original price of x dollars is f(x) = 0.90x. The
coupon price for an item that is y dollars is g(y) = 0.70y.

Symmetry of Functions

The graphs of certain functions have symmetry properties that help us understand the
function and the shape of its graph. For example, consider the function
f(x) = x4 - 2x2 - 3 shown in [link](a). If we take the part of the curve that lies to the
right of the y-axis and flip it over the y-axis, it lays exactly on top of the curve to the left
of the y-axis. In this case, we say the function has symmetry about the y-axis. On the
other hand, consider the function f(x) = x3 - 4x shown in [link](b). If we take the
graph and rotate it 180° about the origin, the new graph will look exactly the same. In
this case, we say the function has symmetry about the origin.

(a) A graph that is symmetric about the y-axis. (b) A graph that is symmetric about
                                            the origin.

If we are given the graph of a function, it is easy to see whether the graph has one of

these symmetry properties. But without a graph, how can we determine algebraically

whether a function f has symmetry? Looking at [link] again, we see that since f is

symmetric about the y-axis, if the point (x, y) is on the graph, the point (-x, y) is on the

graph. In other words, f (-x) = f (x). If a function f has this property, we say f is an

even  function,  which  has  symmetry  about  the  y-axis.  For  example,  f (x)  =       2  is  even

                                                                                     x

because

Equation:

                                              2    2

                             f (-x) = (-x) = x = f (x).
In contrast, looking at [link] again, if a function f is symmetric about the origin, then

whenever the point (x, y) is on the graph, the point (-x, -y) is also on the graph. In

other words, f(-x) = -f(x). If f has this property, we say f is an odd function, which

has  symmetry  about  the  origin.  For  example,  f (x)  =       3  is  odd  because

                                                             x

Equation:

                                         3                3

                           f (-x) = (-x) = -x = -f (x).

Note:
Definition
If f(x) = f(-x) for all x in the domain of f, then f is an even function. An even
function is symmetric about the y-axis.
If f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in the domain of f, then f is an odd function. An odd
function is symmetric about the origin.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Even and Odd Functions

   Determine whether each of the following functions is even, odd, or neither.

      a. f (x) = -5x4 + 7x2 - 2
      b. f (x) = 2x5 - 4x + 5
      c. f (x) = 23x

                                                      x +1

   Solution:

   To determine whether a function is even or odd, we evaluate f(-x) and compare
   it to f(x) and -f(x).

      a. f (-x) = -5(-x) + 7(-x) - 2 = -5x + 7x - 2 = f(x). 4 2 4 2 Therefore,
         f is even.

      b. f (-x) = 2(-x) - 4(-x) + 5 = -2x + 4x + 5. 5 5 Now, f (-x)  f (x).
         Furthermore, noting that -f(x) = -2x5 + 4x - 5, we see that
         f (-x)  -f (x). Therefore, f is neither even nor odd.
c.

                          2          2             2

    f (-x) = 3(-x)/((-x) + 1} = -3x/(x + 1) = -[3x/(x + 1)] = -f (x).

    Therefore, f is odd.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem: Determine whether f (x) = 4x3 - 5x is even, odd, or neither.

   Solution:
   f(x) is odd.
Hint
Compare f(-x) with f(x) and -f (x).

One symmetric function that arises frequently is the absolute value function, written as
|x|. The absolute value function is defined as
Equation:

                                     -x, x < 0

                          f (x) = {             .

                                     x, x  0

Some students describe this function by stating that it "makes everything positive." By
the definition of the absolute value function, we see that if x < 0, then |x| = -x > 0,
and if x > 0, then |x| = x > 0. However, for x = 0, |x| = 0. Therefore, it is more
accurate to say that for all nonzero inputs, the output is positive, but if x = 0, the output
|x| = 0. We conclude that the range of the absolute value function is {y|y  0}. In
[link], we see that the absolute value function is symmetric about the y-axis and is
therefore an even function.
       The graph of f(x) = |x| is
       symmetric about the y-axis.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Working with the Absolute Value Function
   Find the domain and range of the function f(x) = 2|x - 3| + 4.

   Solution:
   Since the absolute value function is defined for all real numbers, the domain of this
   function is (-, ). Since |x - 3|  0 for all x, the function
   f(x) = 2|x - 3| + 4  4. Therefore, the range is, at most, the set {y|y  4}. To
   see that the range is, in fact, this whole set, we need to show that for y  4 there
   exists a real number x such that
   Equation:

                                                                                 2|x - 3| + 4 = y.

   A real number x satisfies this equation as long as
Equation:

           |x - 3| =  1
                          (y - 4).

                      2

Since y  4, we know y - 4  0, and thus the right-hand side of the equation is
nonnegative, so it is possible that there is a solution. Furthermore,
Equation:

                                        -(x - 3)   if x < 3
           |x - 3| = {                                                 .

                                          x-3     if x  3

Therefore, we see there are two solutions:
Equation:

                                                                                        1
                                                                       x = ± (y - 4) + 3.

                                                                                        2

The range of this function is {y|y  4}.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem: For the function f(x) = |x + 2| - 4, find the domain and range.
   Solution:
   Domain = (-, ), range = {y|y  -4}.
Hint
|x + 2|  0 for all real numbers x.

Key Concepts

      A function is a mapping from a set of inputs to a set of outputs with exactly one
      output for each input.
      If no domain is stated for a function y = f (x), the domain is considered to be the
      set of all real numbers x for which the function is defined.
      When sketching the graph of a function f, each vertical line may intersect the
      graph, at most, once.
      A function may have any number of zeros, but it has, at most, one y-intercept.
      To define the composition g  f, the range of f must be contained in the domain of

           g.

      Even functions are symmetric about the y-axis whereas odd functions are
      symmetric about the origin.

      Sketch the graph of a function that has been shifted, stretched, or reflected from its
      initial graph position.

We have studied the general characteristics of functions, so now let's examine some
specific classes of functions. We begin by reviewing the basic properties of linear and
quadratic functions, and then generalize to include higher-degree polynomials. By
combining root functions with polynomials, we can define general algebraic functions
and distinguish them from the transcendental functions we examine later in this chapter.
We finish the section with examples of piecewise-defined functions and take a look at
how to sketch the graph of a function that has been shifted, stretched, or reflected from
its initial form.

Linear Functions and Slope

The easiest type of function to consider is a linear function. Linear functions have the
form f(x) = ax + b, where a and b are constants. In [link], we see examples of linear
functions when a is positive, negative, and zero. Note that if a > 0, the graph of the line
rises as x increases. In other words, f(x) = ax + b is increasing on (-, ). If
a < 0, the graph of the line falls as x increases. In this case, f(x) = ax + b is
decreasing on (-, ). If a = 0, the line is horizontal.
  These linear functions are
 increasing or decreasing on
(, ) and one function is a

         horizontal line.

As suggested by [link], the graph of any linear function is a line. One of the

distinguishing features of a line is its slope. The slope is the change in y for each unit

change in x. The slope measures both the steepness and the direction of a line. If the

slope is positive, the line points upward when moving from left to right. If the slope is

negative, the line points downward when moving from left to right. If the slope is zero,

the line is horizontal. To calculate the slope of a line, we need to determine the ratio of

the change in y versus the change in x. To do so, we choose any two points (x1, y1) and

(x2, y2) on the line and calculate x -x . y2-y1 In [link], we see this ratio is independent of the
                2             1

points chosen.
           For any linear function, the slope
(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) is independent of the choice of

        points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) on the line.

Note:
Definition
Consider line L passing through points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Let y = y2 - y1 and
x = x2 - x1 denote the changes in y and x, respectively. The slope of the line is
Equation:

    y2 - y1     y

m=           =                                       .

    x2 - x1     x

We now examine the relationship between slope and the formula for a linear function.
Consider the linear function given by the formula f (x) = ax + b. As discussed earlier,
we know the graph of a linear function is given by a line. We can use our definition of
slope to calculate the slope of this line. As shown, we can determine the slope by
calculating (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) for any points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) on the line.
Evaluating the function f at x = 0, we see that (0, b) is a point on this line. Evaluating
this function at x = 1, we see that (1, a + b) is also a point on this line. Therefore, the
slope of this line is
Equation:

(a + b) - b  = a.
       1-0

We have shown that the coefficient a is the slope of the line. We can conclude that the
formula f(x) = ax + b describes a line with slope a. Furthermore, because this line
intersects the y-axis at the point (0, b), we see that the y-intercept for this linear function
is (0, b). We conclude that the formula f(x) = ax + b tells us the slope, a, and the y-
intercept, (0, b), for this line. Since we often use the symbol m to denote the slope of a
line, we can write
Equation:

                                                                                     f (x) = mx + b

to denote the slope-intercept form of a linear function.

Sometimes it is convenient to express a linear function in different ways. For example,
suppose the graph of a linear function passes through the point (x1, y1) and the slope of
the line is m. Since any other point (x, f(x)) on the graph of f must satisfy the equation
Equation:

m=  f (x) - y1
                             ,

       x - x1

this linear function can be expressed by writing
Equation:

                                                                          f (x) - y1 = m(x - x1).

We call this equation the point-slope equation for that linear function.

Since every nonvertical line is the graph of a linear function, the points on a nonvertical
line can be described using the slope-intercept or point-slope equations. However, a
vertical line does not represent the graph of a function and cannot be expressed in either
of these forms. Instead, a vertical line is described by the equation x = k for some
constant k. Since neither the slope-intercept form nor the point-slope form allows for
vertical lines, we use the notation
Equation:

                                                                                        ax + by = c,

where a, b are both not zero, to denote the standard form of a line.

where a and b are both not zero. This form is more general because it allows for a
vertical line, x = k.

   A Linear Distance Function
Jessica leaves her house at 5:50 a.m. and goes for a 9-mile run. She returns to her
house at 7:08 a.m. Answer the following questions, assuming Jessica runs at a
constant pace.

   a. Describe the distance D (in miles) Jessica runs as a linear function of her run
      time t (in minutes).

   b. Sketch a graph of D.
   c. Interpret the meaning of the slope.

Solution:

a. At time t = 0, Jessica is at her house, so D (0) = 0. At time t = 78 minutes,
  Jessica has finished running 9 mi, so D (78) = 9. The slope of the linear
  function is

               78 - 0     26

The y-intercept is (0, 0), so the equation for this linear function is

n = 0, we allow for a0 = 0; if a0 = 0, the function f(x) = 0 is called the zero function.

The value n is called the degree of the polynomial; the constant an is called the leading

coefficient. A linear function of the form f (x) = mx + b is a polynomial of degree 1 if

m  0 and degree 0 if m = 0. A polynomial of degree 0 is also called a constant

function. A polynomial function of degree 2 is called a quadratic function. In particular,

a  quadratic  function       has         the  form     f  (x)  =           2  +  bx  +  c,  where       a     0.  A  polynomial

                                                                  ax

function of degree 3 is called a cubic function.

Power Functions

Some polynomial functions are power functions. A power function is any function of

the  form  f (x)          =           b  where  a  and    b  are  any  real      numbers.   The         exponent  in  a  power

                             ax ,

function can be any real number, but here we consider the case when the exponent is a

positive integer. (We consider other cases later.) If the exponent is a positive integer, then

f (x)  =           n  is  a  polynomial.        If  n  is  even,  then        f (x)  =           n  is  an  even  function  because

          ax                                                                            ax

f(-x) = a(-x) = ax n n if n is even. If n is odd, then f(x) = axn is an odd function

because f(-x) = a(-x) = -ax n n if n is odd ([link]).
   (a) For any even integer n, f(x) = axn is an even function. (b) For any odd integer
                                 n, f(x) = axn is an odd function.

Behavior at Infinity
To determine the behavior of a function f as the inputs approach infinity, we look at the
values f(x) as the inputs, x, become larger. For some functions, the values of f(x)
approach a finite number. For example, for the function f (x) = 2 + 1/x, the values
1/x become closer and closer to zero for all values of x as they get larger and larger. For
this function, we say "f(x) approaches two as x goes to infinity," and we write
f (x)  2 as x  . The line y = 2 is a horizontal asymptote for the function
f (x) = 2 + 1/x because the graph of the function gets closer to the line as x gets
larger.

For other functions, the values f(x) may not approach a finite number but instead may

become larger for all values of x as they get larger. In that case, we say "f(x)

approaches infinity as x approaches infinity," and we write f (x)   as x  . For

example, for the function f (x) = 3x2, the outputs f(x) become larger as the inputs x

get  larger.  We  can  conclude  that  the  function       f (x)  =           2  approaches  infinity   as   x

                                                                     3x

approaches infinity, and we write 3x2   as x  . The behavior as x  - and

the meaning of f (x)  - as x   or x  - can be defined similarly. We can

describe what happens to the values of f(x) as x   and as x  - as the end

behavior of the function.

To understand the end behavior for polynomial functions, we can focus on quadratic and

cubic functions. The behavior for higher-degree polynomials can be analyzed similarly.

Consider  a   quadratic  function  f   (x)  =           2  +  bx  +  c.  If  a   >  0,  the  values  f  (x)     

                                               ax

as x  ±. If a < 0, the values f (x)  - as x  ±. Since the graph of a

quadratic function is a parabola, the parabola opens upward if a > 0; the parabola opens

downward if a < 0. (See [link](a).)

Now consider a cubic function f (x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d. If a > 0, then f (x)  
as x   and f (x)  - as x  -. If a < 0, then f (x)  - as x   and
f (x)   as x  -. As we can see from both of these graphs, the leading term of
the polynomial determines the end behavior. (See [link](b).)
 (a) For a quadratic function, if the leading coefficient a > 0, the parabola opens
upward. If a < 0, the parabola opens downward. (b) For a cubic function f, if the

   leading coefficient a > 0, the values f (x)   as x   and the values
f (x)  - as x  -. If the leading coefficient a < 0, the opposite is true.

Zeros of Polynomial Functions

Another characteristic of the graph of a polynomial function is where it intersects the x-

axis. To determine where a function f intersects the x-axis, we need to solve the

equation f(x) = 0 for .n the case of the linear function f(x) = mx + b, the x-intercept

is given by solving the equation mx + b = 0. In this case, we see that the x-intercept is

given by (-b/m, 0). In the case of a quadratic function, finding the x-intercept(s)

requires  finding  the  zeros  of  a  quadratic       equation:           2  +  bx  +  c  =  0.  In  some  cases,  it  is

                                                                 ax

easy  to  factor  the  polynomial           2  +  bx  +  c  to  find  the    zeros.  If  not,  we  make  use  of  the

                                   ax

quadratic formula.

Note:
Rule: The Quadratic Formula
Consider the quadratic equation
Equation:

                                                                                                                           2

                                                                                ax + bx + c = 0,

where a  0. The solutions of this equation are given by the quadratic formula
Equation:

                                        x=  -b ± b2 - 4ac
                                                                                      .

                                                             2a

If  the  discriminant     2  -  4ac  >  0,  this  formula  tells  us  there              are  two  real  numbers              that

                       b

satisfy the quadratic equation. If b2 - 4ac = 0, this formula tells us there is only one

solution, and it is a real number. If b2 - 4ac < 0, no real numbers satisfy the quadratic

equation.

In the case of higher-degree polynomials, it may be more complicated to determine
where the graph intersects the x-axis. In some instances, it is possible to find the x-
intercepts by factoring the polynomial to find its zeros. In other cases, it is impossible to
calculate the exact values of the x-intercepts. However, as we see later in the text, in
cases such as this, we can use analytical tools to approximate (to a very high degree)
where the x-intercepts are located. Here we focus on the graphs of polynomials for
which we can calculate their zeros explicitly.

   For the following functions a. and b., i. describe the behavior of f (x) as
   x  ±, ii. find all zeros of f, and iii. sketch a graph of f.

      a. f (x) = -2x2 + 4x - 1

   Solution:

      a. The function f (x) = -2x2 + 4x - 1 is a quadratic function.
    i. Because a = -2 < 0, as x  ±, f (x)  -.
    ii. To find the zeros of f, use the quadratic formula. The zeros are

       Equation:

         x=                                                =              =                 =         .

                           2 (-2)                                 -4                -4         2

    iii. To sketch the graph of f, use the information from your previous

        downward.

b.  The  function  f  (x)  =      3  -           2  -  4x  is  a  cubic  function.

          x  -, f (x)  -.

    ii. To find the zeros of f, we need to factor the polynomial. First, when we

       Equation:

                                                                                2

                                        f (x) = x(x - 3x - 4).

         Then, when we factor the quadratic function x2 - 3x - 4, we find
         Equation:
                                                                                   f (x) = x(x - 4)(x + 1).

               Therefore, the zeros of f are x = 0, 4, -1.

Mathematical Models

A large variety of real-world situations can be described using mathematical models. A
mathematical model is a method of simulating real-life situations with mathematical
equations. Physicists, engineers, economists, and other researchers develop models by
combining observation with quantitative data to develop equations, functions, graphs,
and other mathematical tools to describe the behavior of various systems accurately.
Models are useful because they help predict future outcomes. Examples of mathematical
models include the study of population dynamics, investigations of weather patterns, and
predictions of product sales.

As an example, let's consider a mathematical model that a company could use to
describe its revenue for the sale of a particular item. The amount of revenue R a
company receives for the sale of n items sold at a price of p dollars per item is described
by the equation R = p  n. The company is interested in how the sales change as the
price of the item changes. Suppose the data in [link] show the number of units a
company sells as a function of the price per item.

p  6     8     10    12    14

n  19.4  18.5  16.2  13.8  12.2

Number of Units Sold n (in Thousands) as a Function of Price per Unit p (in Dollars)
In [link], we see the graph the number of units sold (in thousands) as a function of price
(in dollars). We note from the shape of the graph that the number of units sold is likely a
linear function of price per item, and the data can be closely approximated by the linear
function n = -1.04p + 26 for 0  p  25, where n predicts the number of units sold
in thousands. Using this linear function, the revenue (in thousands of dollars) can be
estimated by the quadratic function
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                       2

                                                R (p) = p  (-1.04p + 26) = -1.04p + 26p

for 0  p  25. In [link], we use this quadratic function to predict the amount of
revenue the company receives depending on the price the company charges per item.
Note that we cannot conclude definitively the actual number of units sold for values of p,
for which no data are collected. However, given the other data values and the graph
shown, it seems reasonable that the number of units sold (in thousands) if the price
charged is p dollars may be close to the values predicted by the linear function

n = -1.04p + 26.
  The data collected for the number of items sold as a function of price is
       roughly linear. We use the linear function n = -1.04p + 26 to
                                estimate this function.

Exercise:

   Problem:
   Maximizing Revenue
A company is interested in predicting the amount of revenue it will receive
depending on the price it charges for a particular item. Using the data from [link],
the company arrives at the following quadratic function to model revenue R as a
function of price per item p:
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                             2

                                          R (p) = p  (-1.04p + 26) = -1.04p + 26p

for 0  p  25.

   a. Predict the revenue if the company sells the item at a price of p = $5 and

           p = $17.

   b. Find the zeros of this function and interpret the meaning of the zeros.
   c. Sketch a graph of R.
   d. Use the graph to determine the value of p that maximizes revenue. Find the

      maximum revenue.

Solution:

   a. Evaluating the revenue function at p = 5 and p = 17, we can conclude that
      Equation:

                                                             2

R(5) = -1.04(5) + 26(5) = 104, so revenue = $104,000;

                                                                      2

R(17) = -1.04(17) + 26(17) = 141.44, so revenue = $144,440.

b. The zeros of this function can be found by solving the equation

                          2  +  26p  =  0.  When  we  factor  the  quadratic  expression,  we  get

-1.04p

p (-1.04p + 26) = 0. The solutions to this equation are given by p = 0, 25.

For these values of p, the revenue is zero. When p = $0, the revenue is zero

because the company is giving away its merchandise for free. When p = $25,

the revenue is zero because the price is too high, and no one will buy any

items.

c. Knowing the fact that the function is quadratic, we also know the graph is a

parabola. Since the leading coefficient is negative, the parabola opens

downward. One property of parabolas is that they are symmetric about the

axis, so since the zeros are at p = 0 and p = 25, the parabola must be

symmetric about the line halfway between them, or p = 12.5.
      d. The function is a parabola with zeros at p = 0 and p = 25, and it is
         symmetric about the line p = 12.5, so the maximum revenue occurs at a price
         of p = $12.50 per item. At that price, the revenue is

                                                                                                    2

                  R (p) = -1.04(12.5) + 26 (12.5) = $162, 500.

Algebraic Functions

By allowing for quotients and fractional powers in polynomial functions, we create a
larger class of functions. An algebraic function is one that involves addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division, rational powers, and roots. Two types of algebraic
functions are rational functions and root functions.
Just as rational numbers are quotients of integers, rational functions are quotients of
polynomials. In particular, a rational function is any function of the form
f (x) = p(x)/q (x), where p(x) and q(x) are polynomials. For example,
Equation:

               f (x) =           3x - 1               and                     g(x) =        4
                                 5x + 2                                               x2 + 1

are  rational  functions.  A  root  function   is  a  power  function         of  the  form    f  (x)  =      1/n

                                                                                                          x,

where n is a positive integer greater than one. For example, f(x) = x1/2 = x is the

square-root    function  and  g  (x)  =  x1/3  =      3  is  the  cube-root       function.    By  allowing  for

                                                   x

compositions of root functions and rational functions, we can create other algebraic

functions. For example, f (x) = 4 - x2 is an algebraic function.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Finding Domain and Range for Algebraic Functions

   For each of the following functions, find the domain and range.

      a. f (x) = 3x-1
                                                       5x+2

      b. f (x) = 4 - x2

Solution:

     a. It is not possible to divide by zero, so the domain is the set of real numbers x
       such that x  -2/5. To find the range, we need to find the values y for which
       there exists a real number x such that
       Equation:

                                               y=        3x - 1
                                                                           .

                                                         5x + 2

     When we multiply both sides of this equation by 5x + 2, we see that x must
     satisfy the equation
     Equation:

                                                                       5xy + 2y = 3x - 1.
    From this equation, we can see that x must satisfy
    Equation:

                                                                      2y + 1 = x(3 - 5y).

    If y = 3/5, this equation has no solution. On the other hand, as long as

    y  3/5,

    Equation:

                                       x=          2y + 1
                                                   3 - 5y

    satisfies this equation. We can conclude that the range of f is {y|y  3/5}.

b.  To  find  the  domain  of  f,  we  need  4  -      2    0.  When                       we  factor,  we  write

                                                   x

    4 - x2 = (2 - x) (2 + x)  0. This inequality holds if and only if both

    terms are positive or both terms are negative. For both terms to be positive,

    we need to find x such that

    Equation:

                           2-x  0               and         2 + x  0.

    These two inequalities reduce to 2  x and x  -2. Therefore, the set
    {x| - 2  x  2} must be part of the domain. For both terms to be negative,

    These two inequalities also reduce to 2  x and x  -2. There are no values
    of x that satisfy both of these inequalities. Thus, we can conclude the domain
    of this function is {x| - 2  x  2}.

    If -2  x  2, then 0  4 - x2  4. Therefore, 0  4 - x2  2, and the
    range of f is {y|0  y  2}.

   Problem: Find the domain and range for the function f (x) = (5x + 2)/(2x - 1).

   Solution:

   The domain is the set of real numbers x such that x  1/2. The range is the set

     {y|y  5/2}.

Hint

The denominator cannot be zero. Solve the equation y = (5x + 2)/(2x - 1) for x to
find the range.

The root functions f (x) = x1/n have defining characteristics depending on whether n is

odd or even. For all even integers n  2, the domain of f (x) = x1/n is the interval

[0,  ).       For  all  odd  integers  n      1,  the  domain  of  f    (x)  =      1/n  is  the  set  of  all  real

numbers. Since x1/n = (-x)1/n for odd integers n, f (x) = x1/n is an odd function if n

is odd. See the graphs of root functions for different values of n in [link].

   Finding Domains for Algebraic Functions

For each of the following functions, determine the domain of the function.

a. f (x) =       3
b. f (x) =  x2-1
             2x+5
            3x2+4

c. f (x) = 4 - 3x

d. f (x) = 2x - 1

Solution:

   a. You cannot divide by zero, so the domain is the set of values x such that
      x2 - 1  0. Therefore, the domain is {x|x  ±1}.

   b. You need to determine the values of x for which the denominator is zero.
      Since 3x2 + 4  4 for all real numbers x, the denominator is never zero.
      Therefore, the domain is (-, ).

   c. Since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, the domain is
      the set of values x for which 4 - 3x  0. Therefore, the domain is

           {x|x  4/3}.

   d. The cube root is defined for all real numbers, so the domain is the interval

Transcendental Functions

Thus far, we have discussed algebraic functions. Some functions, however, cannot be

described by basic algebraic operations. These functions are known as transcendental

functions because they are said to "transcend," or go beyond, algebra. The most

common transcendental functions are trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic

functions. A trigonometric function relates the ratios of two sides of a right triangle.

They are sin x, cos x, tan x, cot x, sec x, and csc x. (We discuss trigonometric

functions later in the chapter.) An exponential function is a function of the form

f  (x)   =      x  where  the  base  b  >  0,  b    1.  A  logarithmic  function  is   a  function  of  the

             b,

form f (x) = logb(x) for some constant b > 0, b  1, where logb (x) = y if and only if

   y  =  x.  (We   also  discuss  exponential     and   logarithmic  functions  later  in  the  chapter.)

         b. This function cannot be written as a formula that involves only basic algebraic
            operations, so it is transcendental. (Note that algebraic functions can only
            have powers that are rational numbers.)

         c. As in part b., this function cannot be written using a formula involving basic

Piecewise-Defined Functions

Sometimes a function is defined by different formulas on different parts of its domain. A
function with this property is known as a piecewise-defined function. The absolute
value function is an example of a piecewise-defined function because the formula
changes with the sign of x:
Equation:

           -x, x < 0

f (x) = {                                                      .

           x, x  0

Other piecewise-defined functions may be represented by completely different formulas,
depending on the part of the domain in which a point falls. To graph a piecewise-defined
function, we graph each part of the function in its respective domain, on the same
coordinate system. If the formula for a function is different for x < a and x > a, we
need to pay special attention to what happens at x = a when we graph the function.
Sometimes the graph needs to include an open or closed circle to indicate the value of
the function at x = a. We examine this in the next example.

                        (x - 2) ,
   Solution:
   Graph the linear function y = x + 3 on the interval (-, 1) and graph the
   quadratic function y = (x - 2)2 on the interval [1, ). Since the value of the
   function at x = 1 is given by the formula f(x) = (x - 2) , 2 we see that f(1) = 1.
   To indicate this on the graph, we draw a closed circle at the point (1, 1). The value
   of the function is given by f(x) = x + 2 for all x < 1, but not at x = 1. To
   indicate this on the graph, we draw an open circle at (1, 4).

      This piecewise-defined function is linear for x < 1 and
                           quadratic for x  1.

output y. For c > 0, the graph of f (x) + c is a shift of the graph of f(x) up c units,
The piecewise-defined function is constant on the intervals (0, 1], (1, 2],....
whereas the graph of f (x) - c is a shift of the graph of f (x) down c units. For

example, the graph of the function f(x) = x3 + 4 is the graph of y = x3 shifted up 4

units;  the  graph  of  the  function  f (x)  =      3  -  4  is  the  graph    of   y    =      3  shifted  down  4

                                                 x                                           x

units ([link]).
   (a) For c > 0, the graph of y = f (x) + c is a vertical shift up c units of the graph
    of y = f(x). (b) For c > 0, the graph of y = f (x) - c is a vertical shift down c

                                  units of the graph of y = f(x).

A horizontal shift of a function occurs if we add or subtract the same constant to each
input x. For c > 0, the graph of f(x + c) is a shift of the graph of f(x) to the left c
units; the graph of f(x - c) is a shift of the graph of f(x) to the right c units. Why does
the graph shift left when adding a constant and shift right when subtracting a constant?
To answer this question, let's look at an example.

Consider the function f (x) = |x + 3| and evaluate this function at x - 3. Since
f (x - 3) = |x| and x - 3 < x, the graph of f (x) = |x + 3| is the graph of y = |x|
shifted left 3 units. Similarly, the graph of f (x) = |x - 3| is the graph of y = |x| shifted
right 3 units ([link]).
      (a) For c > 0, the graph of y = f(x + c) is a horizontal shift left c units of the
     graph of y = f(x). (b) For c > 0, the graph of y = f(x - c) is a horizontal shift

                               right c units of the graph of y = f(x).

A vertical scaling of a graph occurs if we multiply all outputs y of a function by the same

positive constant. For c > 0, the graph of the function cf(x) is the graph of f(x) scaled

vertically by a factor of c. If c > 1, the values of the outputs for the function cf(x) are

larger than the values of the outputs for the function f(x); therefore, the graph has been

stretched vertically. If 0 < c < 1, then the outputs of the function cf(x) are smaller, so

the graph has been compressed. For example, the graph of the function f (x) = 3x2 is

the  graph  of  y  =      2  stretched  vertically  by  a  factor  of  3,  whereas  the  graph  of

                      x

f (x) = x2/3 is the graph of y = x2 compressed vertically by a factor of 3 ([link]).
      (a) If c > 1, the graph of y = cf(x) is a vertical stretch of the graph of
   y = f(x). (b) If 0 < c < 1, the graph of y = cf(x) is a vertical compression

                                  of the graph of y = f(x).

The horizontal scaling of a function occurs if we multiply the inputs x by the same
positive constant. For c > 0, the graph of the function f(cx) is the graph of f(x) scaled
horizontally by a factor of c. If c > 1, the graph of f(cx) is the graph of f(x)
compressed horizontally. If 0 < c < 1, the graph of f (cx) is the graph of f (x)
stretched horizontally. For example, consider the function f (x) = 2x and evaluate f
at x/2. Since f(x/2) = x, the graph of f (x) = 2x is the graph of y = x
compressed horizontally. The graph of y = x/2 is a horizontal stretch of the graph of
y = x ([link]).
     (a) If c > 1, the graph of y = f (cx) is a horizontal compression of the graph of
     y = f(x). (b) If 0 < c < 1, the graph of y = f(cx) is a horizontal stretch of the

                                          graph of y = f(x).

We have explored what happens to the graph of a function f when we multiply f by a
constant c > 0 to get a new function cf(x). We have also discussed what happens to the
graph of a function f when we multiply the independent variable x by c > 0 to get a
new function f(cx). However, we have not addressed what happens to the graph of the
function if the constant c is negative. If we have a constant c < 0, we can write c as a
positive number multiplied by -1; but, what kind of transformation do we get when we
multiply the function or its argument by -1? When we multiply all the outputs by -1,
we get a reflection about the x-axis. When we multiply all inputs by -1, we get a
reflection about the y-axis. For example, the graph of f (x) = -(x3 + 1) is the graph of
y = (x3 + 1) reflected about the x-axis. The graph of f (x) = (-x) + 1 3 is the graph of
y = x3 + 1 reflected about the y-axis ([link]).
    (a) The graph of y = -f(x) is the graph of y = f(x)
   reflected about the x-axis. (b) The graph of y = f(-x)

          is the graph of y = f(x) reflected about the
                                y-axis.

If the graph of a function consists of more than one transformation of another graph, it is
important to transform the graph in the correct order. Given a function f(x), the graph of
the related function y = cf (a (x + b)) + d can be obtained from the graph of y = f(x)
by performing the transformations in the following order.

   1. Horizontal shift of the graph of y = f(x). If b > 0, shift left. If b < 0, shift right.
   2. Horizontal scaling of the graph of y = f(x + b) by a factor of |a|. If a < 0, reflect

      the graph about the y-axis.
   3. Vertical scaling of the graph of y = f(a (x + b)) by a factor of |c|. If c < 0, reflect

      the graph about the x-axis.
   4. Vertical shift of the graph of y = cf(a (x + b)). If d > 0, shift up. If d < 0, shift

      down.

We can summarize the different transformations and their related effects on the graph of
a function in the following table.

Key Concepts

The  power  function    f  (x)  =      n  is  an  even  function  if  n  is  even  and  n    0,  and  it  is

                                   x

an odd function if n is odd.

The  root  function  f  (x)  =      1/n   has  the  domain  [0,  )    if  n  is  even  and  the  domain

                                x

(-, ) if n is odd. If n is odd, then f (x) = x1/n is an odd function.

The domain of the rational function f (x) = p (x)/q (x), where p (x) and q (x) are

polynomial functions, is the set of x such that q (x)  0.

Functions that involve the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,

division, and powers are algebraic functions. All other functions are transcendental.

Trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions are examples of

transcendental functions.

A polynomial function f with degree n  1 satisfies f (x)  ± as x  ±.

The sign of the output as x   depends on the sign of the leading coefficient

only and on whether n is even or odd.

Vertical and horizontal shifts, vertical and horizontal scalings, and reflections about

the x- and y-axes are examples of transformations of functions.

Trigonometric functions are used to model many phenomena, including sound waves, vibrations of
strings, alternating electrical current, and the motion of pendulums. In fact, almost any repetitive, or
cyclical, motion can be modeled by some combination of trigonometric functions. In this section, we
define the six basic trigonometric functions and look at some of the main identities involving these
functions.

Radian Measure

To use trigonometric functions, we first must understand how to measure the angles. Although we
can use both radians and degrees, radians are a more natural measurement because they are related
directly to the unit circle, a circle with radius 1. The radian measure of an angle is defined as
follows. Given an angle , let s be the length of the corresponding arc on the unit circle ([link]). We
say the angle corresponding to the arc of length 1 has radian measure 1.

   The radian measure of an angle  is
    the arc length s of the associated
           arc on the unit circle.

Since an angle of 360° corresponds to the circumference of a circle, or an arc of length 2, we
conclude that an angle with a degree measure of 360° has a radian measure of 2. Similarly, we see
that 180° is equivalent to  radians. [link] shows the relationship between common degree and
radian values.

The Six Basic Trigonometric Functions

Trigonometric functions allow us to use angle measures, in radians or degrees, to find the
coordinates of a point on any circle--not only on a unit circle--or to find an angle given a point on a
circle. They also define the relationship among the sides and angles of a triangle.

To define the trigonometric functions, first consider the unit circle centered at the origin and a point
P = (x, y) on the unit circle. Let  be an angle with an initial side that lies along the positive x-axis
and with a terminal side that is the line segment OP . An angle in this position is said to be in
standard position ([link]). We can then define the values of the six trigonometric functions for  in
terms of the coordinates x and y.

 The angle  is in standard
 position. The values of the
trigonometric functions for 
 are defined in terms of the

     coordinates x and y.

Note:
Definition
Let P = (x, y) be a point on the unit circle centered at the origin O. Let  be an angle with an
initial side along the positive x-axis and a terminal side given by the line segment OP . The
trigonometric functions are then defined as
Equation:

                              sin  = y                                                      1

                              cos  = x                         csc  =

                                                            y                               y

                              tan  =                                                        1

                                                            x  sec  =

                                                                                            x

                                                                                            x

                                                               cot  =

                                                                                            y
If x = 0, sec  and tan  are undefined. If y = 0, then cot  and csc  are undefined.

We can see that for a point P = (x, y) on a circle of radius r with a corresponding angle , the
coordinates x and y satisfy
Equation:

Equation:                                 x

            cos  =

                                          r

           x = r cos 

                                         y

            sin  =

                                          r

           y = r sin .

The values of the other trigonometric functions can be expressed in terms of x, y, and r ([link]).

     For a point P = (x, y) on a circle of radius r, the
         coordinates x and y satisfy x = r cos  and

                                                      y = r sin .

[link] shows the values of sine and cosine at the major angles in the first quadrant. From this table,
we can determine the values of sine and cosine at the corresponding angles in the other quadrants.
The values of the other trigonometric functions are calculated easily from the values of sin  and

cos .

which is true if and only if
Equation:

                                                    2

                                    2cos  - cos  = 0.

To solve this equation, it is important to note that we need to factor the left-hand side and
not divide both sides of the equation by cos . The problem with dividing by cos  is that
it is possible that cos  is zero. In fact, if we did divide both sides of the equation by cos ,
we would miss some of the solutions of the original equation. Factoring the left-hand side
of the equation, we see that  is a solution of this equation if and only if
Equation:

                                                                             cos  (2 cos  - 1) = 0.

Since cos  = 0 when
Equation:

and cos  = 1/2 when
Equation:

                                                                          
                         ,
      =                          ± 2,... or  = - , -                         ± 2,...,

we conclude that the set of solutions to this equation is

b. Using the double-angle formula for sin (2) and the reciprocal identity for tan (), the
  equation can be written as
  Equation:

                                    2 sin  cos  =          sin 
                                                                       .

                                                           cos 

To solve this equation, we multiply both sides by cos  to eliminate the denominator, and
say that if  satisfies this equation, then  satisfies the equation
Equation:

                                                                                                                                           2

                                                                            2 sin cos  - sin  = 0.
      However, we need to be a little careful here. Even if  satisfies this new equation, it may
      not satisfy the original equation because, to satisfy the original equation, we would need
      to be able to divide both sides of the equation by cos . However, if cos  = 0, we cannot
      divide both sides of the equation by cos . Therefore, it is possible that we may arrive at
      extraneous solutions. So, at the end, it is important to check for extraneous solutions.
      Returning to the equation, it is important that we factor sin  out of both terms on the left-
      hand side instead of dividing both sides of the equation by sin . Factoring the left-hand
      side of the equation, we can rewrite this equation as
      Equation:

                                                                                                                                                      2

                                                                                   sin (2cos  - 1) = 0.

      Therefore,  the  solutions  are  given  by  the  angles     such  that  sin   =  0  or             2  =  1/2.

                                                                                              cos 

      The solutions of the first equation are  = 0, ±, ±2,.... The solutions of the second

      equation are  = /4, (/4) ± (/2), (/4) ± ,.... After checking for extraneous

      solutions, the set of solutions to the equation is

                                                     sin  + cos  = 1.

Dividing both sides of this equation by cos2, we obtain
Equation:

                                                                2  +1 =             1

                                                     sin                                     .

Graphs and Periods of the Trigonometric Functions

We have seen that as we travel around the unit circle, the values of the trigonometric functions
repeat. We can see this pattern in the graphs of the functions. Let P = (x, y) be a point on the unit
circle and let  be the corresponding angle . Since the angle  and  + 2 correspond to the same
point P , the values of the trigonometric functions at  and at  + 2 are the same. Consequently, the
trigonometric functions are periodic functions. The period of a function f is defined to be the
smallest positive value p such that f (x + p) = f(x) for all values x in the domain of f. The sine,
cosine, secant, and cosecant functions have a period of 2. Since the tangent and cotangent functions
repeat on an interval of length , their period is  ([link]).
                           The six trigonometric functions are periodic.

Just as with algebraic functions, we can apply transformations to trigonometric functions. In
particular, consider the following function:
Equation:

                                                                               f (x) = A sin (B (x - )) + C.

In [link], the constant  causes a horizontal or phase shift. The factor B changes the period. This
transformed sine function will have a period 2/|B|. The factor A results in a vertical stretch by a
factor of |A|. We say |A| is the "amplitude of f." The constant C causes a vertical shift.
A graph of a general sine function.

Notice in [link] that the graph of y = cos x is the graph of y = sin x shifted to the left /2 units.
Therefore, we can write cos x = sin(x + /2). Similarly, we can view the graph of y = sin x as the
graph of y = cos x shifted right /2 units, and state that sin x = cos(x - /2).

A shifted sine curve arises naturally when graphing the number of hours of daylight in a given
location as a function of the day of the year. For example, suppose a city reports that June 21 is the
longest day of the year with 15.7 hours and December 21 is the shortest day of the year with 8.3
hours. It can be shown that the function
Equation:

                                     2

h (t) = 3.7 sin (                         (x - 80.5)) + 12

                                     365

is a model for the number of hours of daylight h as a function of day of the year t ([link]).
   The hours of daylight as a function of day of the year can be modeled by a
                                     shifted sine curve.

   Problem:

   Describe the relationship between the graph of f (x) = 3 sin (4x) - 5 and the graph of

      y = sin(x).

   Solution:

   To graph f (x) = 3 sin (4x) - 5, the graph of y = sin(x) needs to be compressed horizontally
   by a factor of 4, then stretched vertically by a factor of 3, then shifted down 5 units. The
   function f will have a period of /2 and an amplitude of 3.
Hint

The graph of f can be sketched using the graph of y = sin(x) and a sequence of three
transformations.

Key Concepts

      Radian measure is defined such that the angle associated with the arc of length 1 on the unit
      circle has radian measure 1. An angle with a degree measure of 180° has a radian measure of 
      rad.
      For acute angles , the values of the trigonometric functions are defined as ratios of two sides of
      a right triangle in which one of the acute angles is .
      For a general angle , let (x, y) be a point on a circle of radius r corresponding to this angle .
      The trigonometric functions can be written as ratios involving x, y, and r.
      The trigonometric functions are periodic. The sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant functions have
      period 2. The tangent and cotangent functions have period .

An inverse function reverses the operation done by a particular function. In
other words, whatever a function does, the inverse function undoes it. In
this section, we define an inverse function formally and state the necessary
conditions for an inverse function to exist. We examine how to find an
inverse function and study the relationship between the graph of a function
and the graph of its inverse. Then we apply these ideas to define and discuss
properties of the inverse trigonometric functions.

Existence of an Inverse Function

We begin with an example. Given a function f and an output y = f(x), we

are often interested in finding what value or values x were mapped to y by

f.  For  example,          consider   the     function  f  (x)  =        3  +  4.  Since     any  output

                                                                     x

y = x3 + 4, we can solve this equation for x to find that the input is

x   =        3  -   4.   This  equation     defines  x  as   a  function       of  y.  Denoting     this

         y

function        as  f -1,  and     writing  x  =  f -1  (y)  =      3   -      4,  we   see  that   for  any  x

                                                                y

in the domain of f, f -1 (f (x)) = f -1 (x3 + 4) = x. Thus, this new

function,            -1  "undid"   what     the  original  function         f  did.  A    function  with

                f,

this property is called the inverse function of the original function.

Note:

Definition

Given a function f with domain D and range R, its inverse function (if it

exists) is the function f -1 with domain R and range D such that

     -1  (y)  =     x  if  f  (x)  =  y.  In  other  words,     for  a  function       f  and  its  inverse

f

f -1,
Equation:

     -1                                                          -1
     f (f (x)) = x f or all x in D, and f (f (y)) = y f or all y in R.

Note that f -1 is read as "f inverse." Here, the -1 is not used as an
exponent and f -1 (x)  1/f(x). [link] shows the relationship between the
domain and range of f and the domain and range of f -1.

     Given   a  function     f  and    its  inverse       -1       -1  (y)  =  x   if

                                                     f,       f

     and only if f (x) = y. The range of f becomes the

     domain of f -1 and the domain of f becomes the range

                                       of f -1.

Recall that a function has exactly one output for each input. Therefore, to

define an inverse function, we need to map each input to exactly one output.

For example, let's try to find the inverse function for f (x) = x2. Solving

the  equation   y  =      2  for   x,  we   arrive  at  the   equation      x  =   ±y.    This

                      x

equation does not describe x as a function of y because there are two

solutions to this equation for every y > 0. The problem with trying to find

an inverse function for f (x) = x2 is that two inputs are sent to the same

output  for  each  output       y  >   0.   The  function     f  (x)   =        3  +   4  discussed

                                                                            x

earlier did not have this problem. For that function, each input was sent to a
different output. A function that sends each input to a different output is
called a one-to-one function.

Note:
Definition
We say a f is a one-to-one function if f (x1)  f (x2) when x1  x2.

One way to determine whether a function is one-to-one is by looking at its
graph. If a function is one-to-one, then no two inputs can be sent to the
same output. Therefore, if we draw a horizontal line anywhere in the xy-
plane, according to the horizontal line test, it cannot intersect the graph
more than once. We note that the horizontal line test is different from the
vertical line test. The vertical line test determines whether a graph is the
graph of a function. The horizontal line test determines whether a function
is one-to-one ([link]).

Note:
Rule: Horizontal Line Test
A function f is one-to-one if and only if every horizontal line intersects the
graph of f no more than once.
(a) The function f (x) = x2 is not one-to-one because

it fails the horizontal line test. (b) The function

f  (x)  =      3  is  one-to-one  because  it  passes  the

           x

                  horizontal line test.

   Determining Whether a Function Is One-to-One

   For each of the following functions, use the horizontal line test to
   determine whether it is one-to-one.

      a.
b.
Solution:
   a. Since the horizontal line y = n for any integer n  0 intersects
      the graph more than once, this function is not one-to-one.

   b. Since every horizontal line intersects the graph once (at most),
      this function is one-to-one.

Hint

Use the horizontal line test.

Finding a Function's Inverse

We can now consider one-to-one functions and show how to find their
inverses. Recall that a function maps elements in the domain of f to
elements in the range of f. The inverse function maps each element from
the range of f back to its corresponding element from the domain of f.
Therefore, to find the inverse function of a one-to-one function f, given any
y in the range of f, we need to determine which x in the domain of f
satisfies f(x) = y. Since f is one-to-one, there is exactly one such value x.
We can find that value x by solving the equation f(x) = y for x. Doing so,
we are able to write x as a function of y where the domain of this function

is the range of f and the range of this new function is the domain of f.

Consequently,      this  function      is  the   inverse  of  f,  and  we    write   x   =   f  -1

                                                                                                     (y).

Since we typically use the variable x to denote the independent variable and

y to denote the dependent variable, we often interchange the roles of x and

y,  and  write  y  =  f  -1         Representing      the  inverse     function      in  this   way  is

                              (x).

also helpful later when we graph a function f and its inverse f -1 on the

same axes.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Finding an Inverse Function

    1. Solve the equation y = f (x) for x.

    2.  Interchange   the  variables       x  and  y  and  write    y  =  f  -1

                                                                                  (x).

   Finding an Inverse Function

    Find the inverse for the function f (x) = 3x - 4. State the domain

    Solution:
    Follow the steps outlined in the strategy.

    Step 1. If y = 3x - 4, then 3x = y + 4 and x = 1 y + 4 .
                                                                          3          3

                                    3         3
Since the domain of f is (-, ), the range of f -1 is (-, ).

Since  the  range  of  f  is  (-,  ),  the  domain  of       -1  is  (-,   ).

                                                        f

You can verify that f -1(f(x)) = x by writing
Equation:

f (f (x)) = f (3x - 4) = (3x - 4) +                     = x-            +     = x.

and f(f -1(x)) = x for all x in the domain of the inside function.

Graphing Inverse Functions
Let's consider the relationship between the graph of a function f and the
graph of its inverse. Consider the graph of f shown in [link] and a point
(a, b) on the graph. Since b = f(a), then f -1 (b) = a. Therefore, when we

graph  f  -1      the  point  (b,  a)  is  on  the  graph.  As  a  result,  the  graph  of  f  -1  is  a

               ,

reflection of the graph of f about the line y = x.

(a) The graph of this function f shows point (a, b) on the graph of f.

(b) Since (a, b) is on the graph of f, the point (b, a) is on the graph of

     -1   The     graph  of        -1  is  a  reflection  of  the  graph  of  f  about  the  line

f.                            f

                                               y = x.

Restricting Domains

As  we  have  seen,  f  (x)  =      2  does  not  have   an  inverse  function    because  it  is

                                x

not one-to-one. However, we can choose a subset of the domain of f such

that the function is one-to-one. This subset is called a restricted domain.

By restricting the domain of f, we can define a new function g such that the

domain of g is the restricted domain of f and g(x) = f(x) for all x in the

domain of g. Then we can define an inverse function for g on that domain.

For  example,  since    f (x)  =      2  is  one-to-one  on  the  interval   [0,  ),  we  can

                                  x

define a new function g such that the domain of g is [0, ) and g(x) = x2

for all x in its domain. Since g is a one-to-one function, it has an inverse

function,  given  by  the  formula           -1   =  x.      On  the  other  hand,  the

                                         g (x)

function f(x) = x2 is also one-to-one on the domain (-, 0]. Therefore,

we could also define a new function h such that the domain of h is (-, 0]
and h(x) = x2 for all x in the domain of h. Then h is a one-to-one function
and must also have an inverse. Its inverse is given by the formula
h-1(x) = -x ([link]).

        (a) For g (x) = x2 restricted to [0, ), g-1 (x) = x. (b) For
              h (x) = x2 restricted to (-, 0], h-1 (x) = -x.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Restricting the Domain
   Consider the function f (x) = (x + 1) . 2

      a. Sketch the graph of f and use the horizontal line test to show that
         f is not one-to-one.
b. Show that f is one-to-one on the restricted domain [-1, ).

Determine the domain and range for the inverse of f on this

restricted  domain  and  find  a  formula  for  f  -1

                                                        .

Solution:

   a. The graph of f is the graph of y = x2 shifted left 1 unit. Since
      there exists a horizontal line intersecting the graph more than
      once, f is not one-to-one.

b. On the interval [-1, ), f is one-to-one.
The domain and range of f -1 are given by the range and domain
of f, respectively. Therefore, the domain of f -1 is [0, ) and
the range of f -1 is [-1, ). To find a formula for f -1, solve the
equation y = (x + 1)2 for x. If y = (x + 1) , 2 then
x = -1 ± y. Since we are restricting the domain to the
interval where x  -1, we need ±y  0. Therefore,
x = -1 + y. Interchanging x and y, we write y = -1 + x
and conclude that f -1 (x) = -1 + x.

The domain and range of f -1 is given by the range and domain of f,

respectively.  To   find       -1  solve     y  =                2  for  x.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions

The six basic trigonometric functions are periodic, and therefore they are

not one-to-one. However, if we restrict the domain of a trigonometric

function to an interval where it is one-to-one, we can define its inverse.

Consider the sine function ([link]). The sine function is one-to-one on an

infinite number of intervals, but the standard convention is to restrict the

domain  to  the  interval  [-         ,     ].  By  doing           so,  we  define  the  inverse     sine
                                   2     2

function on the domain [-1, 1] such that for any x in the interval [-1, 1],

the  inverse  sine  function  tells      us  which  angle                in  the  interval  [-     ,     ]
                                                                                                2     2

satisfies sin  = x. Similarly, we can restrict the domains of the other

trigonometric functions to define inverse trigonometric functions, which

are functions that tell us which angle in a certain interval has a specified

trigonometric value.

To graph the inverse trigonometric functions, we use the graphs of the

the graphs about the line y = x ([link]).
  The graph of each of the inverse trigonometric functions is a reflection
     about the line y = x of the corresponding restricted trigonometric
                                        function.

Note:
Go to the following site for more comparisons of functions and their
inverses.
When evaluating an inverse trigonometric function, the output is an angle.

For  example,               to  evaluate  cos-1                  (  1  ),  we   need   to  find  an  angle            such   that
                                                                    2

cos  =    1  .       Clearly,         many              angles      have   this    property.    However,        given        the
          2

definition of cos-1, we need the angle  that not only solves this equation,

but also lies in the interval [0, ]. We conclude that cos ( 2 ) -1 = 3 . 1 

We now consider a composition of a trigonometric function and its inverse.
For example, consider the two expressions sin (sin ( 2 )) -1 2 and
sin (sin()). -1 For the first one, we simplify as follows:
Equation:

                                          -1 2                                                     2
                                                                                                            .
                                sin (sin (                             )) = sin ( ) =
                                                                                                     2
                                                                 2                       4

For the second one, we have
Equation:

                                          -1                                       -1

                                      sin (sin ()) = sin (0) = 0.

The inverse function is supposed to "undo" the original function, so why

isn't            -1  (sin      ())    =   ?             Recalling          our  definition  of     inverse      functions,        a

       sin

function  f          and       its  inverse                  -1  satisfy   the  conditions      f           -1  (y))  =   y  for    all

                                                        f                                          (f

y in the domain of f -1 and f -1 (f (x)) = x for all x in the domain of f, so

what   happened                here?  The               issue    is  that  the  inverse     sine   function,                -1  is

                                                                                                                  sin ,

the  inverse         of     the     restricted              sine    function    defined     on  the  domain           [-     ,      ].
                                                                                                                          2      2

Therefore, for x in the interval [- 2  , 2 ]  , it is true that sin-1 (sin x) = x.
However, for values of x outside this interval, the equation does not hold,

   Evaluating Expressions Involving Inverse Trigonometric

   Evaluate each of the following expressions.

      a. sin ( -1 - ) 3
                                                            2

                                                    3

Solution:

a.  Evaluating            -1  (-3/2)                                 is  equivalent   to   finding  the  angle  

                sin

    such that sin  = -3/2 and -/2    /2. The angle
     = -/3 satisfies these two conditions. Therefore,

              -1

    sin (-3/2) = -/3.

b. First we use the fact that tan-1 (-1/3) = -/6. Then

    tan (/6) = -1/3. Therefore,

                                   -1

    tan (tan (-1/3)) = -1/3.

c.  To  evaluate             -1  (cos                            (5/4)),  first  use  the  fact  that

                  cos

    cos (5/4) = -2/2. Then we need to find the angle  such

    that cos () = -2/2 and 0    . Since 3/4 satisfies both

    these conditions, we have

    cos (cos-1 (5/4)) = cos (cos ( -1 -2/2)) = 3/4.

d. Since cos (2/3) = -1/2, we need to evaluate sin-1 (-1/2).

    That is, we need to find the angle  such that sin () = -1/2

    and -/2    /2. Since -/6 satisfies both these

    conditions, we can conclude that

        -1                                                       -1
    sin (cos (2/3)) = sin (-1/2) = -/6.

Note:
The Maximum Value of a Function
In many areas of science, engineering, and mathematics, it is useful to
know the maximum value a function can obtain, even if we don't know its
exact value at a given instant. For instance, if we have a function
describing the strength of a roof beam, we would want to know the
maximum weight the beam can support without breaking. If we have a
function that describes the speed of a train, we would want to know its
maximum speed before it jumps off the rails. Safe design often depends on
knowing maximum values.
This project describes a simple example of a function with a maximum
value that depends on two equation coefficients. We will see that maximum
values can depend on several factors other than the independent variable x.

   1. Consider the graph in [link] of the function y = sin x + cos x.
      Describe its overall shape. Is it periodic? How do you know?

           The graph of y = sin x + cos x.

      Using a graphing calculator or other graphing device, estimate the x-
      and y-values of the maximum point for the graph (the first such point
      where x > 0). It may be helpful to express the x-value as a multiple of
      .
2. Now consider other graphs of the form y = A sin x + B cos x for
  various values of A and B. Sketch the graph when A = 2 and B = 1,
  and find the x- and y-values for the maximum point. (Remember to
  express the x-value as a multiple of , if possible.) Has it moved?

3. Repeat for A = 1, B = 2. Is there any relationship to what you found in
  part (2)?

4. Complete the following table, adding a few choices of your own for A
  and B:

ABxy  A   B   xy

0  1  3   1

1  0  1   3

1  1  12  5

1  2  5   12

2  1

2  2

3  4

4  3

5. Try to figure out the formula for the y-values.
6. The formula for the x-values is a little harder. The most helpful points

  from the table are (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1). (Hint: Consider inverse

  trigonometric functions.)
7. If you found formulas for parts (5) and (6), show that they work
  together. That is, substitute the x-value formula you found into
  y = A sin x + B cos x and simplify it to arrive at the y-value formula
  you found.

Key Concepts

For a function to have an inverse, the function must be one-to-one.

Given the graph of a function, we can determine whether the function

is one-to-one by using the horizontal line test.

If a function is not one-to-one, we can restrict the domain to a smaller

domain where the function is one-to-one and then define the inverse of

the function on the smaller domain.

For  a  function   f  and  its  inverse       -1  f           -1  (x))  =  x  for  all  x  in  the

                                         f,          (f

domain of f -1 and f -1 (f (x)) = x for all x in the domain of f.

Since the trigonometric functions are periodic, we need to restrict their

domains to define the inverse trigonometric functions.

The  graph  of  a  function     f  and  its  inverse       -1     are   symmetric       about  the

                                                      f

line y = x.

                                                                                x           b.

Recognize the significance of the number e.

Identify the form of a logarithmic function.

Explain the relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions.

Describe how to calculate a logarithm to a different base.

Identify the hyperbolic functions, their graphs, and basic identities.

In this section we examine exponential and logarithmic functions. We use the properties of these
functions to solve equations involving exponential or logarithmic terms, and we study the meaning
and importance of the number e. We also define hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions, which
involve combinations of exponential and logarithmic functions. (Note that we present alternative
definitions of exponential and logarithmic functions in the chapter Applications of Integrations, and
prove that the functions have the same properties with either definition.)

Exponential Functions

Exponential functions arise in many applications. One common example is population growth.

For example, if a population starts with P0 individuals and then grows at an annual rate of 2%, its
population after 1 year is
Equation:

                                                         P (1) = P0 + 0.02P0 = P0(1 + 0.02) = P0(1.02).

Its population after 2 years is
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                2

                                                    P (2) = P (1) + 0.02P (1) = P (1)(1.02) = P0(1.02) .

In general, its population after t years is
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                  t

                                                                                                P (t) = P0(1.02) ,

which  is             an  exponential       function.     More     generally,   any    function                                                                                                      of  the  form  f  (x)                                         =     x  where

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      b,

b > 0, b  1, is an exponential function with base b and exponent x. Exponential functions have

constant bases and variable exponents. Note that a function of the form f (x) = xb for some constant

b is not an exponential function but a power function.

To see the difference between an exponential function and a power function, we compare the

functions             y   =      2  and  y  =      x  In  [link],  we  see  that  both      x  and                                                                                                       2  approach   infinity                                       as    x    .

factors of b). If x is a negative integer, then x = -y for some positive integer y, and we define

bx = b-y = 1/by. Also, b0 is defined to be 1. If x is a rational number, then x = p/q, where p and q

are  integers   and     x  =     p/q  =     q   For     example,          3/2  =  93   =  27.  However,            how   is      x  defined   if  x

numbers approaching 2, and the values of 2x for each rational number x are presented as well. We

Suppose a particular population of bacteria is known to double in size every 4 hours. If a

culture starts with 1000 bacteria, the number of bacteria after 4 hours is n(4) = 1000  2. The

number of bacteria after 8 hours is n(8) = n(4)  2 = 1000  22. In general, the number of

bacteria     after       4m  hours       is  n(4m)  =   1000         m  Letting  t  =  4m,   we    see  that  the  number        of

bacteria after t hours is n(t) = 1000  2t/4. Find the number of bacteria after 6 hours, 10 hours,

and 24 hours.

The number of bacteria after 6 hours is given by n (6) = 1000  26/4  2828 bacteria. The

number       of     bacteria      after  10  hours  is  given  by  n  (10)  =    1000        10/4    5657     bacteria.   The

x  -. On the other hand, if 0 < b < 1, f (x) = bx is decreasing on (-, ) and bx  0 as

The Number e

A special type of exponential function appears frequently in real-world applications. To describe it,
consider the following example of exponential growth, which arises from compounding interest in a
savings account. Suppose a person invests P dollars in a savings account with an annual interest rate
r, compounded annually. The amount of money after 1 year is
Equation:

                                                                                  A(1) = P + rP = P (1 + r).

The amount of money after 2 years is
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              2

                                          A(2) = A(1) + rA(1) = P (1 + r) + rP (1 + r) = P (1 + r) .

More generally, the amount after t years is

Values of (1 + m ) 1 m as m  

Looking at this table, it appears that (1 + 1/m)m is approaching a number between 2.7 and 2.8 as
m  . In fact, (1 + 1/m)m does approach some number as m  . We call this number e. To
six decimal places of accuracy,
Equation:

                                                     e  2.718282.

The letter e was first used to represent this number by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler
during the 1720s. Although Euler did not discover the number, he showed many important
connections between e and logarithmic functions. We still use the notation e today to honor Euler's
work because it appears in many areas of mathematics and because we can use it in many practical
applications.

Returning to our savings account example, we can conclude that if a person puts P dollars in an
account at an annual interest rate r, compounded continuously, then A (t) = P ert. This function may
be familiar. Since functions involving base e arise often in applications, we call the function
f (x) = ex the natural exponential function. Not only is this function interesting because of the
definition of the number e, but also, as discussed next, its graph has an important property.

Since  e  >  1,  we  know     x  is  increasing  on  (-,  ).  In    [link],  we         show  a  graph  of  f  (x)  =     x  along

                           e                                                                                           e

with a tangent line to the graph of at x = 0. We give a precise definition of tangent line in the next

chapter; but, informally, we say a tangent line to a graph of f at x = a is a line that passes through

the point (a, f (a)) and has the same "slope" as f at that point . The function f (x) = ex is the only

exponential function bx with tangent line at x = 0 that has a slope of 1. As we see later in the text,
having this property makes the natural exponential function the most simple exponential function to
use in many instances.

The  graph  of  f  (x)  =     x  has  a

                           e

tangent line with slope 1 at x = 0.

   Compounding Interest

   Suppose $500 is invested in an account at an annual interest rate of r = 5.5%, compounded
   continuously.

      a. Let t denote the number of years after the initial investment and A(t) denote the amount
         of money in the account at time t. Find a formula for A(t).

      b. Find the amount of money in the account after 10 years and after 20 years.

a. If P dollars are invested in an account at an annual interest rate r, compounded
  continuously, then A (t) = P ert. Here P = $500 and r = 0.055. Therefore,

Logarithmic Functions

Using our understanding of exponential functions, we can discuss their inverses, which are the
logarithmic functions. These come in handy when we need to consider any phenomenon that varies
over a wide range of values, such as pH in chemistry or decibels in sound levels.

The  exponential  function  f  (x)  =     x     is  one-to-one,  with     domain   (-,                                                 )    and  range  (0,  ).

                                       b

Therefore, it has an inverse function, called the logarithmic function with base b. For any

b > 0, b  1, the logarithmic function with base b, denoted logb, has domain (0, ) and range

(-, ), and satisfies

Equation:

                                                                                                                                    y

                                    logb (x) = y if and only if b = x.

For example,
Equation:

                  log2(8) = 3                         since                   3
                                                      since
                                             1        since               2 = 8,

                  log10 100 ( ) = -2                                      10-2  =     1  2=                                            1    ,

                  logb(1) = 0                                                      10                                                  100

                                                                             0

                                                                          b = 1 f or any base b > 0.

Furthermore,  since  y  =  logb(x)  and         y  =     x  are  inverse  functions,

                                                      b

Equation:

                                       x log log (b ) = x and b b(x) = x.

                                                 b
The most commonly used logarithmic function is the function loge. Since this function uses natural e
as its base, it is called the natural logarithm. Here we use the notation ln(x) or ln x to mean

loge (x). For example,
Equation:

                                 3  3
     ln (e) = loge (e) = 1, ln (e ) = loge (e ) = 3, ln (1) = loge (1) = 0.

Since the functions f (x) = ex and g (x) = ln(x) are inverses of each other,
Equation:

                                 x  ln x

                                 ln (e ) = x and e  = x,

and their graphs are symmetric about the line y = x ([link]).

The  functions  y  =     x  and

                      e

y = ln (x) are inverses of each

other, so their graphs are

symmetric about the line y = x.

Note:
At this site you can see an example of a base-10 logarithmic scale.

In general, for any base b > 0, b  1, the function g (x) = logb(x) is symmetric about the line y = x
with the function f (x) = bx. Using this fact and the graphs of the exponential functions, we graph
functions logb for several values of b > 1 ([link]).
Graphs of y = logb(x) are
depicted for b = 2, e, 10.

Before solving some equations involving exponential and logarithmic functions, let's review the
basic properties of logarithms.

   Solve each of the following equations for x.

      a. 5x = 2
      b. ex + 6e-x = 5

   Solution:
a. Applying the natural logarithm function to both sides of the equation, we have
  Equation:

                                                                                                                                                     x

                                                                                                 ln5 = ln 2.

  Using the power property of logarithms,
  Equation:

                                                                                                x ln 5 = ln 2.

  Therefore, x = ln 2/ln 5.
b. Multiplying both sides of the equation by ex, we arrive at the equation

  Equation:

                                         2x                x
                                        e + 6 = 5e .

    Rewriting this equation as
    Equation:

                                     2x      x
                                     e - 5e + 6 = 0,

    we can then rewrite it as a quadratic equation in ex:
    Equation:

                                     x2         x

                                (e ) - 5 (e ) + 6 = 0.

    Now we can solve the quadratic equation. Factoring this equation, we obtain
    Equation:

                                     x       x
                                (e - 3) (e - 2) = 0.

    Therefore, the solutions satisfy ex = 3 and ex = 2. Taking the natural logarithm of both
    sides gives us the solutions x = ln 3, ln 2.

                                                                                       log10x.

Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as

                                         3                           4

  The solution is x = 104/3 = 1010. 3
c. Using the power property of logarithmic functions, we can rewrite the equation as

     ln (2x) - ln (x6) = 0.

  Using the quotient property, this becomes
  Equation:

                                                          ln (                   ) = 0.

Hint
First use the power property, then use the product property of logarithms.

When evaluating a logarithmic function with a calculator, you may have noticed that the only options
are log10 or log, called the common logarithm, or ln, which is the natural logarithm. However,
exponential functions and logarithm functions can be expressed in terms of any desired base b. If you
need to use a calculator to evaluate an expression with a different base, you can apply the change-of-
base formulas first. Using this change of base, we typically write a given exponential or logarithmic
function in terms of the natural exponential and natural logarithmic functions.

Note:
Rule: Change-of-Base Formulas

If b = e, this equation reduces to ax = exlogea = exlna.

2. logax = log a logbx for any real number x > 0.
                                                                    b

If b = e, this equation reduces to logax =                             ln x

                                                                              .

                                                                       ln a

Proof
For the first change-of-base formula, we begin by making use of the power property of logarithmic

functions.  We  know  that  for  any  base  b   >  0,  b                    1,                       x  =  xlogba.  Therefore,

                                                                                logb(a )

Equation:

                                                   b                     x  =b     xlogba.

                                                    logb(a )

In addition, we know that bx and logb(x) are inverse functions. Therefore,
Equation:

                                                       log (ax) x
                                                      bb
                                                                                =a .

Combining these last two equalities, we conclude that ax = bxlogba.

To prove the second property, we show that
Equation:

                                                                                       (logba)  (logax) = logbx.

Let u = logba, v = logax, and w = logbx. We will show that u  v = w. By the definition of
logarithmic functions, we know that bu = a, av = x, and bw = x. From the previous equations, we
see that
Equation:

                                            uv         uv                       v                          w
                                      b = (b ) = a = x = b .

Therefore, buv = bw. Since exponential functions are one-to-one, we can conclude that u  v = w.

   Problem:
   Chapter Opener: The Richter Scale for Earthquakes

(credit: modification of work by
   Robb Hannawacker, NPS)

In 1935, Charles Richter developed a scale (now known as the Richter scale) to measure the
magnitude of an earthquake. The scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, and it can be described as
follows: Consider one earthquake with magnitude R1 on the Richter scale and a second
earthquake with magnitude R2 on the Richter scale. Suppose R1 > R2, which means the
earthquake of magnitude R1 is stronger, but how much stronger is it than the other earthquake?
A way of measuring the intensity of an earthquake is by using a seismograph to measure the
amplitude of the earthquake waves. If A1 is the amplitude measured for the first earthquake and
A2 is the amplitude measured for the second earthquake, then the amplitudes and magnitudes of
the two earthquakes satisfy the following equation:
Equation:

                                     A1

R1 - R2 = log10 (                        ).

                                     A2

Consider an earthquake that measures 8 on the Richter scale and an earthquake that measures 7
on the Richter scale. Then,
Equation:

                                  (  )
                                                                  A1

                                             8 - 7 = log10 (          ).

                                                                  A2

Therefore,
Equation:

                                                       A1

                                             log10 (         ) = 1,

                                                       A2

which implies A1/A2 = 10 or A1 = 10A2. Since A1 is 10 times the size of A2, we say that the
first earthquake is 10 times as intense as the second earthquake. On the other hand, if one
earthquake measures 8 on the Richter scale and another measures 6, then the relative intensity
of the two earthquakes satisfies the equation
Equation:

                                                  A1

                                         log10 (       ) = 8 - 6 = 2.

                                                  A2

Therefore, A1 = 100A2. That is, the first earthquake is 100 times more intense than the second
earthquake.

How can we use logarithmic functions to compare the relative severity of the magnitude 9
earthquake in Japan in 2011 with the magnitude 7.3 earthquake in Haiti in 2010?

Solution:
To compare the Japan and Haiti earthquakes, we can use an equation presented earlier:

9 - 7.3 = log (    A1  ).

            10     A2

Therefore,  A1/A2  =           1.7  and  we  conclude  that  the  earthquake  in  Japan  was  approximately  50

                       10 ,

times more intense than the earthquake in Haiti.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem:

   Compare the relative severity of a magnitude 8.4 earthquake with a magnitude 7.4 earthquake.

   Solution:

   The magnitude 8.4 earthquake is roughly 10 times as severe as the magnitude 7.4 earthquake.
Hint
R1 - R2 = log10 (A1/A2).

Hyperbolic Functions

The hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of certain combinations of ex and e-x. These functions
arise naturally in various engineering and physics applications, including the study of water waves
and vibrations of elastic membranes. Another common use for a hyperbolic function is the
representation of a hanging chain or cable, also known as a catenary ([link]). If we introduce a
coordinate system so that the low point of the chain lies along the y-axis, we can describe the height
of the chain in terms of a hyperbolic function. First, we define the hyperbolic functions.

The shape of a strand of silk in a spider's web can be
described in terms of a hyperbolic function. The same

  shape applies to a chain or cable hanging from two
supports with only its own weight. (credit: "Mtpaley",

The name cosh rhymes with "gosh," whereas the name sinh is pronounced "cinch." Tanh, sech, csch,
and coth are pronounced "tanch," "seech," "coseech," and "cotanch," respectively.

Using the definition of cosh(x) and principles of physics, it can be shown that the height of a
hanging chain, such as the one in [link], can be described by the function h (x) = a cosh (x/a) + c
for certain constants a and c.

But why are these functions called hyperbolic functions? To answer this question, consider the

quantity                  2  -                   2  Using    the  definition  of  cosh  and  sinh,  we          see  that

          cosh t                  sinh t.

                                                                  2t              -2t          2t                  -2t

                                  cosh t - sinh t =                                     -                                = 1.

                                                                              4                     4

x  , since e-x  0 as x  . As x  -, cosh x approaches 1/2e-x, whereas sinh x

approaches                         -x  Therefore,  using  the  graphs  of                  x                  -x  and                         -x  as  guides,  we

graph cosh x and sinh x. To graph tanh x, we use the fact that tanh (0) = 1, -1 < tanh (x) < 1

for all x, tanh x  1 as x  , and tanh x  -1 as x  -. The graphs of the other three

hyperbolic functions can be sketched using the graphs of cosh x, sinh x, and tanh x ([link]).

                                                                                                            .

Since cosh x  1 for all x, we must have cosh x = 5/4. Then, using the definitions for
the other hyperbolic functions, we conclude that
tanh x = 3/5, csch x = 4/3, sech x = 4/5, and coth x = 5/3.

Hint

Use the definition of the cosh function and the power property of logarithm functions.

Inverse Hyperbolic Functions

From the graphs of the hyperbolic functions, we see that all of them are one-to-one except cosh x and
sech x. If we restrict the domains of these two functions to the interval [0, ), then all the hyperbolic
functions are one-to-one, and we can define the inverse hyperbolic functions. Since the hyperbolic
functions themselves involve exponential functions, the inverse hyperbolic functions involve
logarithmic functions.

Let's  look   at  how  to  derive  the  first  equation.   The  others  follow  similarly.  Suppose  y  =                 -1

                                                                                                           sinh x.

Then, x = sinh y and, by the definition of the hyperbolic sine function, x = 2 e . y-e-y Therefore,

Equation:

                                                       y           -y
                                                    e - 2x - e = 0.

Multiplying this equation by ey, we obtain
Equation:

                                                       2y       y
                                                    e - 2xe - 1 = 0.
This can be solved like a quadratic equation, with the solution
Equation:

                                     y       2x ± 4x2 + 4            = x ± x2 + 1.
                                                              2
                                  e=

Since     y  >  0,  the  only  solution  is  the  one  with     the  positive                                                                                           sign.  Applying  the  natural  logarithm  to

       e

both sides of the equation, we conclude that

Equation:

                                                  y = ln (x + x2 + 1).

Key Concepts

     The  exponential     function             y  =     x  is  increasing  if  b  >  1  and                                                   decreasing  if  0  <   b  <  1.  Its  domain

                                                     b

     is (-, ) and its range is (0, ).

     The  logarithmic     function  y             =  logb(x)   is  the  inverse   of    y  =                                                     x  Its  domain  is  (0,  )    and  its

                                                                                                                                              b.

     range is (-, ).

     The natural exponential function is y = ex and the natural logarithmic function is

     y = ln x = logex.

     Given an exponential function or logarithmic function in base a, we can make a change of base
     to convert this function to any base b > 0, b  1. We typically convert to base e.
     The hyperbolic functions involve combinations of the exponential functions ex and e-x. As a
     result, the inverse hyperbolic functions involve the natural logarithm.

For the following exercises, evaluate the given exponential functions as indicated, accurate to two
significant digits after the decimal.

    travel at high

   there a limit to
     how fast a
   spacecraft can
     go? (credit:

       NASA)
Science fiction writers often imagine spaceships that can travel to far-off
planets in distant galaxies. However, back in 1905, Albert Einstein showed
that a limit exists to how fast any object can travel. The problem is that the
faster an object moves, the more mass it attains (in the form of energy),
according to the equation
Equation:

m=  m0
                    ,

                             v2

    1 -

                             c2

where m0 is the object's mass at rest, v is its speed, and c is the speed of
light. What is this speed limit? (We explore this problem further in [link].)

The idea of a limit is central to all of calculus. We begin this chapter by
examining why limits are so important. Then, we go on to describe how to
find the limit of a function at a given point. Not all functions have limits at
all points, and we discuss what this means and how we can tell if a function
does or does not have a limit at a particular value. This chapter has been
created in an informal, intuitive fashion, but this is not always enough if we
need to prove a mathematical statement involving limits. The last section of
this chapter presents the more precise definition of a limit and shows how to
prove whether a function has a limit.

As we embark on our study of calculus, we shall see how its development
arose from common solutions to practical problems in areas such as
engineering physics--like the space travel problem posed in the chapter
opener. Two key problems led to the initial formulation of calculus: (1) the
tangent problem, or how to determine the slope of a line tangent to a curve
at a point; and (2) the area problem, or how to determine the area under a
curve.

The Tangent Problem and Differential Calculus

Rate of change is one of the most critical concepts in calculus. We begin
our investigation of rates of change by looking at the graphs of the three
lines f (x) = -2x - 3, g (x) = 21 x + 1, and h (x) = 2, shown in [link].
The rate of change of a linear function is constant in each of these
      three graphs, with the constant determined by the slope.

As we move from left to right along the graph of f (x) = -2x - 3, we see
that the graph decreases at a constant rate. For every 1 unit we move to the
right along the x-axis, the y-coordinate decreases by 2 units. This rate of
change is determined by the slope (-2) of the line. Similarly, the slope of
1/2 in the function g (x) tells us that for every change in x of 1 unit there is
a corresponding change in y of 1/2 unit. The function h (x) = 2 has a slope
of zero, indicating that the values of the function remain constant. We see
that the slope of each linear function indicates the rate of change of the
function.

Compare  the  graphs  of  these  three  functions  with  the  graph  of  k  (x)  =      2

                                                                                    x

([link]). The graph of k (x) = x2 starts from the left by decreasing rapidly,

then begins to decrease more slowly and level off, and then finally begins to

increase--slowly at first, followed by an increasing rate of increase as it

moves toward the right. Unlike a linear function, no single number

represents the rate of change for this function. We quite naturally ask: How

do we measure the rate of change of a nonlinear function?
The  function  k  (x)  =      2  does  not  have  a  constant  rate

                          x

                          of change.

We can approximate the rate of change of a function f (x) at a point
(a, f (a)) on its graph by taking another point (x, f (x)) on the graph of
f (x), drawing a line through the two points, and calculating the slope of
the resulting line. Such a line is called a secant line. [link] shows a secant
line to a function f (x) at a point (a, f (a)).
 The slope of a secant line through a point (a, f (a))
estimates the rate of change of the function at the point

                                                   (a, f (a)).

We formally define a secant line as follows:

Note:
Definition
The secant to the function f (x) through the points (a, f (a)) and
(x, f (x)) is the line passing through these points. Its slope is given by
Equation:

msec =  f (x) - f (a)
                                         .

                 x-a
The accuracy of approximating the rate of change of the function with a
secant line depends on how close x is to a. As we see in [link], if x is closer
to a, the slope of the secant line is a better measure of the rate of change of
f (x) at a.

       As x gets closer to a, the slope of the secant line
   becomes a better approximation to the rate of change of

                       the function f (x) at a.

The secant lines themselves approach a line that is called the tangent to the
function f (x) at a ([link]). The slope of the tangent line to the graph at a
measures the rate of change of the function at a. This value also represents
the derivative of the function f (x) at a, or the rate of change of the
function at a. This derivative is denoted by f  (a). Differential calculus is
the field of calculus concerned with the study of derivatives and their
applications.

manipulate yourself, visit this applet (Note: this site requires a Java

    Solving the Tangent Problem: As x approaches a, the
             secant lines approach the tangent line.

[link] illustrates how to find slopes of secant lines. These slopes estimate
the slope of the tangent line or, equivalently, the rate of change of the
function at the point at which the slopes are calculated.

Use the formula for the slope of a secant line from the definition.

a. msec =     4-1      =3              = 2.5
b. msec =
              2-1                   5

The point in part b. is closer to the point (1, 1), so the slope of 2.5 is
closer to the slope of the tangent line. A good estimate for the slope of
the tangent would be in the range of 2 to 2.5 ([link]).

We continue our investigation by exploring a related question. Keeping in
mind that velocity may be thought of as the rate of change of position,
suppose that we have a function, s (t), that gives the position of an object
along a coordinate axis at any given time t. Can we use these same ideas to
create a reasonable definition of the instantaneous velocity at a given time
t = a? We start by approximating the instantaneous velocity with an
average velocity. First, recall that the speed of an object traveling at a
constant rate is the ratio of the distance traveled to the length of time it has
traveled. We define the average velocity of an object over a time period to
be the change in its position divided by the length of the time period.

Note:
Definition
Let s (t) be the position of an object moving along a coordinate axis at
time t. The average velocity of the object over a time interval [a, t] where
a < t (or [t, a] if t < a) is
Equation:

             vave =  s (t) - s (a)
                                                    .

                             t-a
As t is chosen closer to a, the average velocity becomes closer to the
instantaneous velocity. Note that finding the average velocity of a position
function over a time interval is essentially the same as finding the slope of a
secant line to a function. Furthermore, to find the slope of a tangent line at a
point a, we let the x-values approach a in the slope of the secant line.
Similarly, to find the instantaneous velocity at time a, we let the t-values
approach a in the average velocity. This process of letting x or t approach a
in an expression is called taking a limit. Thus, we may define the
instantaneous velocity as follows.

Note:
Definition
For a position function s (t), the instantaneous velocity at a time t = a is
the value that the average velocities approach on intervals of the form [a, t]
and [t, a] as the values of t become closer to a, provided such a value
exists.

[link] illustrates this concept of limits and average velocity.

by  s  (t)  =                     2  +  64.  Find  the  average  velocity  of  the  rock  over

                -16t

each of the given time intervals. Use this information to guess the

instantaneous velocity of the rock at time t = 0.5.

    a. [0.49, 0.5]
    b. [0.5, 0.51]

Solution:

Substitute the data into the formula for the definition of average
velocity.

    a. vave =      s(0.49)-s(0.5)            = -15.84
    b. vave =             0.49-0.5           = -16.016

                   s(0.51)-s(0.5)
                          0.51-0.5

The instantaneous velocity is somewhere between -15.84 and -16.16
ft/sec. A good guess might be -16 ft/sec.

The Area Problem and Integral Calculus

We now turn our attention to a classic question from calculus. Many
quantities in physics--for example, quantities of work--may be interpreted
as the area under a curve. This leads us to ask the question: How can we
find the area between the graph of a function and the x-axis over an interval
([link])?

     The Area Problem: How do we
   find the area of the shaded region?

As in the answer to our previous questions on velocity, we first try to
approximate the solution. We approximate the area by dividing up the
interval [a, b] into smaller intervals in the shape of rectangles. The
approximation of the area comes from adding up the areas of these
rectangles ([link]).
 The area of the region under the
curve is approximated by summing

    the areas of thin rectangles.

As the widths of the rectangles become smaller (approach zero), the sums
of the areas of the rectangles approach the area between the graph of f (x)
and the x-axis over the interval [a, b]. Once again, we find ourselves taking
a limit. Limits of this type serve as a basis for the definition of the definite
integral. Integral calculus is the study of integrals and their applications.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Estimation Using Rectangles

Estimate  the  area  between  the  x-axis  and  the  graph  of  f  (x)  =      2  +  1

                                                                           x

over the interval [0, 3] by using the three rectangles shown in [link].
        The area of the region under the
        curve of f (x) = x2 + 1 can be

           estimated using rectangles.

   Solution:
   The areas of the three rectangles are 1 unit2, 2 unit2, and 5 unit2.
   Using these rectangles, our area estimate is 8 unit2.

Other Aspects of Calculus

So far, we have studied functions of one variable only. Such functions can
be represented visually using graphs in two dimensions; however, there is
no good reason to restrict our investigation to two dimensions. Suppose, for
example, that instead of determining the velocity of an object moving along
a coordinate axis, we want to determine the velocity of a rock fired from a
catapult at a given time, or of an airplane moving in three dimensions. We
might want to graph real-value functions of two variables or determine
volumes of solids of the type shown in [link]. These are only a few of the
types of questions that can be asked and answered using multivariable
calculus. Informally, multivariable calculus can be characterized as the
study of the calculus of functions of two or more variables. However,
before exploring these and other ideas, we must first lay a foundation for
the study of calculus in one variable by exploring the concept of a limit.

   We can use multivariable calculus
      to find the volume between a

     surface defined by a function of
        two variables and a plane.
Key Concepts

      Differential calculus arose from trying to solve the problem of
      determining the slope of a line tangent to a curve at a point. The slope
      of the tangent line indicates the rate of change of the function, also
      called the derivative. Calculating a derivative requires finding a limit.
      Integral calculus arose from trying to solve the problem of finding the
      area of a region between the graph of a function and the x-axis. We can
      approximate the area by dividing it into thin rectangles and summing
      the areas of these rectangles. This summation leads to the value of a
      function called the integral. The integral is also calculated by finding a
      limit and, in fact, is related to the derivative of a function.
      Multivariable calculus enables us to solve problems in three-
      dimensional space, including determining motion in space and finding
      volumes of solids.

The concept of a limit or limiting process, essential to the understanding of calculus,
has been around for thousands of years. In fact, early mathematicians used a limiting
process to obtain better and better approximations of areas of circles. Yet, the formal
definition of a limit--as we know and understand it today--did not appear until the
late 19th century. We therefore begin our quest to understand limits, as our
mathematical ancestors did, by using an intuitive approach. At the end of this chapter,
armed with a conceptual understanding of limits, we examine the formal definition of a
limit.

We begin our exploration of limits by taking a look at the graphs of the functions
Equation:

f (x) =  x2 - 4                      |x - 2|                                  1
                          , g (x) =                    , and h (x) =
                                                                                            ,
          x-2                         x-2
                                                                                                2

                                                                      (x - 2)

which are shown in [link]. In particular, let's focus our attention on the behavior of
each graph at and around x = 2.
       These graphs show the behavior of three different functions around x = 2.

Each of the three functions is undefined at x = 2, but if we make this statement and no
other, we give a very incomplete picture of how each function behaves in the vicinity
of x = 2. To express the behavior of each graph in the vicinity of 2 more completely,
we need to introduce the concept of a limit.

Intuitive Definition of a Limit

Let's first take a closer look at how the function f (x) = (x2 - 4)/(x - 2) behaves
around x = 2 in [link]. As the values of x approach 2 from either side of 2, the values
of y = f (x) approach 4. Mathematically, we say that the limit of f (x) as x
approaches 2 is 4. Symbolically, we express this limit as
Equation:

                                                                                     lim f (x) = 4.

                                                                                                                        x2

From this very brief informal look at one limit, let's start to develop an intuitive
definition of the limit. We can think of the limit of a function at a number a as being
the one real number L that the functional values approach as the x-values approach a,
provided such a real number L exists. Stated more carefully, we have the following
definition:

Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval containing a, with the
possible exception of a itself, and let L be a real number. If all values of the function
f (x) approach the real number L as the values of x ( a) approach the number a,
then we say that the limit of f (x) as x approaches a is L. (More succinct, as x gets
closer to a, f (x) gets closer and stays close to L.) Symbolically, we express this idea
as
Equation:

                                                                                    lim f (x) = L.

                                                                                                                       xa

We can estimate limits by constructing tables of functional values and by looking at
their graphs. This process is described in the following Problem-Solving Strategy.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Estimating a Limit Using a Table of Functional Values

   1. To estimate limf (x), we begin by completing a table of functional values. We

                                                         xa

      should choose two sets of x-values--one set of values approaching a and less
      than a, and another set of values approaching a and greater than a. [link]
      demonstrates what your tables might look like.

x           f (x)           x           f (x)
            f (a - 0.1)                 f (a + 0.1)
a - 0.1     f (a - 0.01)    a + 0.1     f (a + 0.01)
a - 0.01    f (a - 0.001)   a + 0.01    f (a + 0.001)
a - 0.001   f (a - 0.0001)  a + 0.001   f (a + 0.0001)
a - 0.0001                  a + 0.0001
x  f (x)                                                                                                  x  f (x)

Use additional values as                                                                                  Use additional values as
necessary.                                                                                                necessary.

Table of Functional Values for limf (x)

                                                                                                      xa

2. Next, let's look at the values in each of the f (x) columns and determine whether
  the values seem to be approaching a single value as we move down each column.
  In our columns, we look at the sequence
  f (a - 0.1), f (a - 0.01), f (a - 0.001). , f (a - 0.0001), and so on, and
  f (a + 0.1), f (a + 0.01), f (a + 0.001), f (a + 0.0001), and so on. (Note:

  Although we have chosen the x-values
  a ± 0.1, a ± 0.01, a ± 0.001, a ± 0.0001, and so forth, and these values will
  probably work nearly every time, on very rare occasions we may need to modify
  our choices.)
3. If both columns approach a common y-value L, we estimate limf (x) = L. We

                                                                                                                                                                                                               xa

  can use the following strategy to confirm the result obtained from the table or as
  an alternative method for estimating a limit.
4. Using a graphing calculator or computer software that allows us graph functions,
  we can plot the function f (x), making sure the functional values of f (x) for x-
  values near a are in our window. We can use the trace feature to move along the
  graph of the function and watch the y-value readout as the x-values approach a. If
  the y-values approach L as our x-values approach a from both directions, then
   limf (x) = L. We may need to zoom in on our graph and repeat this process

        xa

  several times.

We apply this Problem-Solving Strategy to compute a limit in [link].

Note: The values in this table were obtained using a calculator and using all the
places given in the calculator output.

                                                                              (sin x)

As we read down each x column, we see that the values in each column
appear to be approaching one. Thus, it is fairly reasonable to estimate that

lim x sinx = 1. A calculator-or computer-generated graph of f (x) = x (sinx) would

be similar to that shown in [link], and it confirms our estimate.
The graph of f (x) = (sin x)/x confirms the estimate
                         from [link].

After inspecting this table, we see that the functional values less than 4 appear to
be decreasing toward 0.25 whereas the functional values greater than 4 appear to

At this point, we see from [link] and [link] that it may be just as easy, if not easier, to
estimate a limit of a function by inspecting its graph as it is to estimate the limit by
using a table of functional values. In [link], we evaluate a limit exclusively by looking
at a graph rather than by using a table of functional values.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Evaluating a Limit Using a Graph

   For g (x) shown in [link], evaluate lim g (x).

                                                                                                                             x-1
       The graph of g (x) includes one value not on a smooth
                                    curve.

   Solution:
   Despite the fact that g (-1) = 4, as the x-values approach -1 from either side,
   the g (x) values approach 3. Therefore, lim g (x) = 3. Note that we can

                                                                                                                                             x-1

   determine this limit without even knowing the algebraic expression of the
   function.

Based on [link], we make the following observation: It is possible for the limit of a
function to exist at a point, and for the function to be defined at this point, but the limit
of the function and the value of the function at the point may be different.

Hint
What y-value does the function approach as the x-values approach 2?

Looking at a table of functional values or looking at the graph of a function provides us
with useful insight into the value of the limit of a function at a given point. However,
these techniques rely too much on guesswork. We eventually need to develop
alternative methods of evaluating limits. These new methods are more algebraic in
nature and we explore them in the next section; however, at this point we introduce two
special limits that are foundational to the techniques to come.

Note:
Two Important Limits
Let a be a real number and c be a constant.
    i. Equation:

                                                                                                lim x = a

                                                                                                                                       xa

   ii. Equation:

                                                                                                 lim c = c

                                                                                                                                        xa

We can make the following observations about these two limits.
   i. For the first limit, observe that as x approaches a, so does f (x), because
      f (x) = x. Consequently, limx = a.

                                                                                                       xa

  ii. For the second limit, consider [link].

x           f (x) = c                                                                                     x           f (x) = c

a - 0.1     c                                                                                             a + 0.1     c

a - 0.01    c                                                                                             a + 0.01    c

a - 0.001   c                                                                                             a + 0.001   c

a - 0.0001  c                                                                                             a + 0.0001  c

Table of Functional Values for limc = c

                                                                                                      xa

Observe that for all values of x (regardless of whether they are approaching a), the

values f (x) remain constant at c. We have no choice but to conclude limc = c.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      xa

The Existence of a Limit
As we consider the limit in the next example, keep in mind that for the limit of a
function to exist at a point, the functional values must approach a single real-number
value at that point. If the functional values do not approach a single value, then the
limit does not exist.

                                    x0

After examining the table of functional values, we can see that the y-values do
not seem to approach any one single value. It appears the limit does not exist.
Before drawing this conclusion, let's take a more systematic approach. Take the
following sequence of x-values approaching 0:
Equation:

,   ,     ,     ,     ,                                                                      ,....

 3 5 7 9 11

The corresponding y-values are
Equation:

                                                                   1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1,....

At this point we can indeed conclude that limsin (1/x) does not exist.

                                                                                                                                          x0

(Mathematicians frequently abbreviate "does not exist" as DNE. Thus, we would
write limsin (1/x) DNE.) The graph of f (x) = sin (1/x) is shown in [link]

                   x0

and it gives a clearer picture of the behavior of sin(1/x) as x approaches 0. You
can see that sin(1/x) oscillates ever more wildly between -1 and 1 as x

approaches 0.

The graph of f (x) = sin(1/x) oscillates rapidly
       between -1 and 1 as x approaches 0.

One-Sided Limits

Sometimes indicating that the limit of a function fails to exist at a point does not
provide us with enough information about the behavior of the function at that particular
point. To see this, we now revisit the function g (x) = |x - 2|/ (x - 2) introduced at
the beginning of the section (see [link](b)). As we pick values of x close to 2, g (x)
does not approach a single value, so the limit as x approaches 2 does not exist--that is,
limg (x) DNE. However, this statement alone does not give us a complete picture of

x2

the behavior of the function around the x-value 2. To provide a more accurate
description, we introduce the idea of a one-sided limit. For all values to the left of 2
(or the negative side of 2), g (x) = -1. Thus, as x approaches 2 from the left, g (x)
approaches -1. Mathematically, we say that the limit as x approaches 2 from the left is
-1. Symbolically, we express this idea as
Equation:

                                                                                   lim g (x) = -1.

                                                                                                                   x2-

Similarly, as x approaches 2 from the right (or from the positive side), g (x) approaches
1. Symbolically, we express this idea as
Equation:

                                                                                     lim g (x) = 1.

                                                                                                                       x2+
We can now present an informal definition of one-sided limits.

Note:
Definition
We define two types of one-sided limits.
Limit from the left: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval of
the form (b,a), and let L be a real number. If the values of the function f (x) approach
the real number L as the values of x (where x < a) approach the number a, then we
say that L is the limit of f (x) as x approaches a from the left. Symbolically, we
express this idea as
Equation:

                                                                                     lim f (x) = L.

                                                                                                                     xa-

Limit from the right: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval
of the form (a, c), and let L be a real number. If the values of the function f (x)
approach the real number L as the values of x (where x > a) approach the number a,
then we say that L is the limit of f (x) as x approaches a from the right. Symbolically,
we express this idea as
Equation:

                                                                                     lim f (x) = L.

                                                                                                                     xa+

less than 2, we use f (x) = x + 1 and for values of x greater than 2, we use

Based on this table, we can estimate that a. lim f (x) = 3 and b. lim f (x) = 0.

Therefore, the (two-sided) limit of f (x) does not exist at x = 2. [link] shows a

graph of f (x) and reinforces our conclusion about these limits.

Let us now consider the relationship between the limit of a function at a point and the
limits from the right and left at that point. It seems clear that if the limit from the right
and the limit from the left have a common value, then that common value is the limit
of the function at that point. Similarly, if the limit from the left and the limit from the
right take on different values, the limit of the function does not exist. These
conclusions are summarized in [link].

Infinite Limits

Evaluating the limit of a function at a point or evaluating the limit of a function from
the right and left at a point helps us to characterize the behavior of a function around a
given value. As we shall see, we can also describe the behavior of functions that do not
have finite limits.

We now turn our attention to h (x) = 1/(x - 2) , 2 the third and final function
introduced at the beginning of this section (see [link](c)). From its graph we see that as
the values of x approach 2, the values of h (x) = 1/(x - 2)2 become larger and larger
and, in fact, become infinite. Mathematically, we say that the limit of h (x) as x
approaches 2 is positive infinity. Symbolically, we express this idea as
Equation:

                                                                                 lim h (x) = +.

                                                                                                                  x2

More generally, we define infinite limits as follows:

Note:
Definition
We define three types of infinite limits.
Infinite limits from the left: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open
interval of the form (b, a).

    i. If the values of f (x) increase without bound as the values of x (where x < a)
      approach the number a, then we say that the limit as x approaches a from the left
      is positive infinity and we write
      Equation:

                                                                                       lim f (x) = +.

                                                                                                                         xa-

   ii. If the values of f (x) decrease without bound as the values of x (where x < a)
      approach the number a, then we say that the limit as x approaches a from the left
      is negative infinity and we write
      Equation:

                                                                                       lim f (x) = -.

                                                                                                                         xa-

Infinite limits from the right: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open

The graph of f (x) = 1/x in [link] confirms these conclusions.

Hint

Follow the procedures from [link].

It is useful to point out that functions of the form f (x) = 1/(x - a) , n where n is a
positive integer, have infinite limits as x approaches a from either the left or right
([link]). These limits are summarized in [link].
           The function f (x) = 1/(x - a)n has infinite limits at a.

Note:
Infinite Limits from Positive Integers
If n is a positive even integer, then
Equation:

                              1                = +.
           lim
           xa n (x - a)

If n is a positive odd integer, then
Equation:

                                         1

           lim                              n  = +

                                      +
           xa (x - a)

and
Equation:
                                    1

                      lim                n  = -.

                                 -
                      xa (x - a)

We should also point out that in the graphs of f (x) = 1/(x - a) , n points on the graph
having x-coordinates very near to a are very close to the vertical line x = a. That is, as
x approaches a, the points on the graph of f (x) are closer to the line x = a. The line
x = a is called a vertical asymptote of the graph. We formally define a vertical
asymptote as follows:

Note:
Definition
Let f (x) be a function. If any of the following conditions hold, then the line x = a is
a vertical asymptote of f (x).

Chapter Opener: Einstein's Equation

           (credit: NASA)

In the chapter opener we mentioned briefly how Albert Einstein showed that a
limit exists to how fast any object can travel. Given Einstein's equation for the
mass of a moving object, what is the value of this bound?

Solution:

Our starting point is Einstein's equation for the mass of a moving object,
Equation:

                           m=        m0
                                                     ,

                                                        v2

                               1 -

                                                        c2

where m0 is the object's mass at rest, v is its speed, and c is the speed of light. To
see how the mass changes at high speeds, we can graph the ratio of masses
m/m0 as a function of the ratio of speeds, v/c ([link]).
      This graph shows the ratio of
   masses as a function of the ratio of
    speeds in Einstein's equation for

       the mass of a moving object.

We can see that as the ratio of speeds approaches 1--that is, as the speed of the
object approaches the speed of light--the ratio of masses increases without
bound. In other words, the function has a vertical asymptote at v/c = 1. We can
try a few values of this ratio to test this idea.

v       1 -     v2 m

c c2 m0

0.99    0.1411                                  7.089

0.999   0.0447                                  22.37

0.9999  0.0141                                  70.71

Ratio of Masses and Speeds for a Moving Object

Thus, according to [link], if an object with mass 100 kg is traveling at 0.9999c,
its mass becomes 7071 kg. Since no object can have an infinite mass, we
conclude that no object can travel at or more than the speed of light.

Key Concepts

      A table of values or graph may be used to estimate a limit.
      If the limit of a function at a point does not exist, it is still possible that the limits
      from the left and right at that point may exist.
      If the limits of a function from the left and right exist and are equal, then the limit
      of the function is that common value.
      We may use limits to describe infinite behavior of a function at a point.

Glossary

infinite limit
      A function has an infinite limit at a point a if it either increases or decreases
      without bound as it approaches a

intuitive definition of the limit
      If all values of the function f (x) approach the real number L as the values of
      x ( a) approach a, f (x) approaches L

one-sided limit
      A one-sided limit of a function is a limit taken from either the left or the right

vertical asymptote
      A function has a vertical asymptote at x = a if the limit as x approaches a from
      the right or left is infinite
The Limit Laws

      Recognize the basic limit laws.
      Use the limit laws to evaluate the limit of a function.
      Evaluate the limit of a function by factoring.
      Use the limit laws to evaluate the limit of a polynomial or rational function.
      Evaluate the limit of a function by factoring or by using conjugates.
      Evaluate the limit of a function by using the squeeze theorem.

In the previous section, we evaluated limits by looking at graphs or by constructing a table of values. In this
section, we establish laws for calculating limits and learn how to apply these laws. In the Student Project at
the end of this section, you have the opportunity to apply these limit laws to derive the formula for the area
of a circle by adapting a method devised by the Greek mathematician Archimedes. We begin by restating
two useful limit results from the previous section. These two results, together with the limit laws, serve as a
foundation for calculating many limits.

Evaluating Limits with the Limit Laws

The first two limit laws were stated in [link] and we repeat them here. These basic results, together with the
other limit laws, allow us to evaluate limits of many algebraic functions.

   Evaluating a Basic Limit

   Evaluate each of the following limits using [link].

      b. lim 5

                        x2

   Solution:
a. The limit of x as x approaches a is a: limx = 2.

                                                                                                                                   x2

b. The limit of a constant is that constant: lim5 = 5.

                                                                                                                                          x2

We now take a look at the limit laws, the individual properties of limits. The proofs that these laws hold are
omitted here.

Note:

Limit Laws

are real numbers such that limf (x) = L and limg (x) = M. Let c be a constant. Then, each of the

following statements holds:

Sum law for limits: lim (f (x) + g (x)) = limf (x) + limg (x) = L + M

                         xa                                            xa                                                xa

Difference law for limits: lim (f (x) - g (x)) = limf (x) - limg (x) = L - M

                             xa                                                                                  xa                                xa

Constant multiple law for limits: limcf (x) = c  limf (x) = cL

   Evaluating a Limit Using Limit Laws

   Use the limit laws to evaluate lim (4x + 2).

                                                                                                            x-3

Solution:

Let's apply the limit laws one step at a time to be sure we understand how they work. We need to keep
in mind the requirement that, at each application of a limit law, the new limits must exist for the limit
law to be applied.

 lim (4x + 2)   = lim 4x + lim 2                                                                                 Apply the sum law.

Solution:

To find this limit, we need to apply the limit laws several times. Again, we need to keep in mind that
as we rewrite the limit in terms of other limits, each new limit must exist for the limit law to be
applied.

Limits of Polynomial and Rational Functions

By now you have probably noticed that, in each of the previous examples, it has been the case that
limf (x) = f (a). This is not always true, but it does hold for all polynomials for any choice of a and for

xa

all rational functions at all values of a for which the rational function is defined.
Note:
Limits of Polynomial and Rational Functions
Let p (x) and q (x) be polynomial functions. Let a be a real number. Then,
Equation:

                                                         lim p (x) = p (a)

                                                         xa

Equation:

                                                p (x)         p (a)

                                          lim            =           when q (a)  0.

                                          xa q (x)            q (a)

To  see  that  this  theorem  holds,  consider  the      polynomial  p  (x)              =              n  +                     n-1  +    +  c1x  +  c0.  By

                                                                                            cnx               cn-1x

applying the sum, constant multiple, and power laws, we end up with

Equation:

                     lim p (x)                  n             n-1    +  + c1x + c0)
                                = lim (cnx + cn-1x
                     xa
                                      xa

                                                   n                    n-1

                                = cn(lim x)              + cn-1( lim x)                  +  + c1 (lim x) + lim c0

                                                     xa                              xa                       xa                         xa

                                      n                  n-1  +  + c1a + c0
                                = cna + cn-1a

                                = p (a).

It now follows from the quotient law that if p (x) and q (x) are polynomials for which q (a)  0, then
Equation:

                                                              p (x)     p (a)

                                                         lim         =                      .

                                                         xa q (x)       q (a)

Additional Limit Evaluation Techniques

As we have seen, we may evaluate easily the limits of polynomials and limits of some (but not all) rational
functions by direct substitution. However, as we saw in the introductory section on limits, it is certainly
possible for limf (x) to exist when f (a) is undefined. The following observation allows us to evaluate

                                        xa

many limits of this type:

If for all x  a, f (x) = g (x) over some open interval containing a, then limf (x) = limg (x).

                                                                                                                                                                               xa  xa

To understand this idea better, consider the limit lim x-1 . x2-1
                                                                                                                                                                 x1

The function
Equation:

              f (x)                                                            =  x2-1
                                                                                  x-1

                                                                               =  (x-1)(x+1)
                                                                                            x-1

and the function g (x) = x + 1 are identical for all values of x  1. The graphs of these two functions are
shown in [link].
             The graphs of f (x) and g (x) are identical for all x  1. Their limits at 1 are equal.

We see that

                                                    = lim (x + 1)

                                                             x1

                                                    = 2.

                 f (x)
The limit has the form lim g(x) , where limf (x) = 0 and limg (x) = 0. (In this case, we say that
             xa         xa                                       xa

f(x)/g(x) has the indeterminate form 0/0.) The following Problem-Solving Strategy provides a general

outline for evaluating limits of this type.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Calculating a Limit When f (x)/g (x) has the Indeterminate Form 0/0

   1. First, we need to make sure that our function has the appropriate form and cannot be evaluated
      immediately using the limit laws.

   2. We then need to find a function that is equal to h (x) = f(x)/g(x) for all x  a over some interval
      containing a. To do this, we may need to try one or more of the following steps:

         a. If f (x) and g (x) are polynomials, we should factor each function and cancel out any common
            factors.

         b. If the numerator or denominator contains a difference involving a square root, we should try
            multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the expression involving the
            square root.

         c. If f(x)/g(x) is a complex fraction, we begin by simplifying it.
3. Last, we apply the limit laws.

The next examples demonstrate the use of this Problem-Solving Strategy. [link] illustrates the factor-and-
cancel technique; [link] shows multiplying by a conjugate. In [link], we look at simplifying a complex
fraction.

Solution:

Step 1. The function f (x) = 2x2-5x-3 x2-3x is undefined for x = 3. In fact, if we substitute 3 into the

   Problem:
   Evaluating a Limit by Multiplying by a Conjugate

Evaluate lim . x+2-1
                                                        x+1
                              x-1

Solution:

Step 1.    x+2-1      has the form 0/0 at -1. Let's begin by multiplying by x + 2 + 1, the conjugate of
                 x+1

x + 2 - 1, on the numerator and denominator:

Equation:

                                                             x + 2 - 1         x + 2 - 1 x + 2 + 1

                      lim                                               = lim                           .

                      x-1                                    x+1        x-1       x+1        x + 2 + 1

Step 2. We then multiply out the numerator. We don't multiply out the denominator because we are
hoping that the (x + 1) in the denominator cancels out in the end:
Equation:

                                                                                  x+1

                                                             = lim                             .

                                                             x-1

                                                                          (x + 1) (x + 2 + 1)

Step 3. Then we cancel:
Equation:

                                                                                  1

                                                                  = lim                .

                                                                        x-1 x + 2 + 1

Step 4. Last, we apply the limit laws:
Equation:

                                                                               1       1

                                                                  lim                  =.

                                                                  x-1 x + 2 + 1 2

Evaluate lim x+1 . - 2
             x1 x-1

Solution:

             1    -  1

Step 1.      x+1     2     has the form 0/0 at 1. We simplify the algebraic fraction by multiplying by

             x-1

2 (x + 1)/2 (x + 1) :

Equation:

                                       1    -  1               1    -  1

Step 2. Next, we multiply through the numerators. Do not multiply the denominators because we want
to be able to cancel the factor (x - 1):
Equation:

                                                   2 - (x + 1)

                                            = lim                           .

                                               x1 2 (x - 1) (x + 1)

Step 3. Then, we simplify the numerator:
Equation:

                                                               -x + 1

                                            = lim                           .

                                               x1 2 (x - 1) (x + 1)

Step 4. Now we factor out -1 from the numerator:
Equation:

                                                   - (x - 1)

                                            = lim                           .

                                               x1 2 (x - 1) (x + 1)
Step 5. Then, we cancel the common factors of (x - 1):
Equation:

                                                 -1

                         = lim                                                                                                               .

                         x1 2 (x + 1)

Step 6. Last, we evaluate using the limit laws:
Equation:

                                          -1                 1

[link] does not fall neatly into any of the patterns established in the previous examples. However, with a
little creativity, we can still use these same techniques.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Evaluating a Limit When the Limit Laws Do Not Apply

Evaluate lim ( + ). 1 5
x0 x  x(x-5)

Solution:

Both 1/x and 5/x (x - 5) fail to have a limit at zero. Since neither of the two functions has a limit at
zero, we cannot apply the sum law for limits; we must use a different strategy. In this case, we find the
limit by performing addition and then applying one of our previous strategies. Observe that
Equation:
                    1        +       5          =       x-5+5
                                                        x(x-5)
                    x                x(x-5)

                                                =              x

                                                                       .

                                                        x(x-5)

Thus,
Equation:

Hint

Use the same technique as [link]. Don't forget to factor x2 - 2x - 3 before getting a common
denominator.

Let's now revisit one-sided limits. Simple modifications in the limit laws allow us to apply them to one-

sided limits. For example, to apply the limit laws to a limit of the form lim h (x), we require the function

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          xa-

      b. lim x - 3

Solution:
[link] illustrates the function f (x) = x - 3 and aids in our understanding of these limits.

   The graph shows the function

                    f (x) = x - 3.

a. The function f (x) = x - 3 is defined over the interval [3, +). Since this function is not
  defined to the left of 3, we cannot apply the limit laws to compute lim x - 3. In fact, since

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   x3-

  f (x) = x - 3 is undefined to the left of 3, lim x - 3 does not exist.

                                                                                                                                                               x3-

b. Since f (x) = x - 3 is defined to the right of 3, the limit laws do apply to lim x - 3. By

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      x3+

  applying these limit laws we obtain lim x - 3 = 0.

                                                                                                                               x3+

In [link] we look at one-sided limits of a piecewise-defined function and use these limits to draw a
conclusion about a two-sided limit of the same function.

This graph shows a function f (x).

a. Since f (x) = 4x - 3 for all x in (-, 2), replace f (x) in the limit with 4x - 3 and apply the
  limit laws:

b. Since f (x) = (x - 3)2 for all x in (2, +), replace f (x) in the limit with (x - 3)2 and apply
  the limit laws:

   Evaluating a Limit of the Form K/0, K  0 Using the Limit Laws

Evaluate lim 2 x-3 .
                              x2- x -2x

Solution:

Step 1. After substituting in x = 2, we see that this limit has the form -1/0. That is, as x approaches

2 from the left, the numerator approaches -1; and the denominator approaches 0. Consequently, the

magnitude of      x-3                    becomes infinite. To get a better idea of what the limit is, we need to factor the
              x(x-2)

denominator:

Equation:

                                                        x-3         x-3

Step 2. Since x - 2 is the only part of the denominator that is zero when 2 is substituted, we then
separate 1/(x - 2) from the rest of the function:
Equation:

                                                        x-3                   1

                                                        = lim                      .

Step 3. lim x-3 = - 1             and lim 1             = -. Therefore, the product of (x - 3)/x and 1/(x - 2)
                         x2- x 2               x2- x-2

The Squeeze Theorem

The techniques we have developed thus far work very well for algebraic functions, but we are still unable to
evaluate limits of very basic trigonometric functions. The next theorem, called the squeeze theorem, proves
very useful for establishing basic trigonometric limits. This theorem allows us to calculate limits by
"squeezing" a function, with a limit at a point a that is unknown, between two functions having a common
known limit at a. [link] illustrates this idea.
The Squeeze Theorem applies when

f (x)  g (x)  h (x) and lim f (x) = lim h (x).

Solution:

Because -1  cos x  1 for all x, we have -|x|  x cos x  |x|. Since lim (-|x|) = 0 = lim|x|,

                                                                                                        x0                 x0

squeezed between them.

We now use the squeeze theorem to tackle several very important limits. Although this discussion is
somewhat lengthy, these limits prove invaluable for the development of the material in both the next section
and the next chapter. The first of these limits is limsin . Consider the unit circle shown in [link]. In the

                                                                                                                                                             0

figure, we see that sin  is the y-coordinate on the unit circle and it corresponds to the line segment shown in
blue. The radian measure of angle  is the length of the arc it subtends on the unit circle. Therefore, we see
that for 0 <  < , 0 < sin  < . 

                                                           2
    The sine function is shown as a line on the unit circle.

Because lim 0 = 0 and lim  = 0, by using the squeeze theorem we conclude that

         0+                    0+

Equation:

                                                        lim sin  = 0.

                                                       0+

To see that lim-sin  = 0 as well, observe that for - 2 <  < 0, 0 < - < 2   and hence,
                                     0

0 < sin (-) < -. Consequently, 0 < -sin  < -. It follows that 0 > sin  > . An application of the

squeeze theorem produces the desired limit. Thus, since lim sin  = 0 and lim sin  = 0,

                                                                  0+               0-

Equation:

                                                       limsin  = 0.

                                                       0

Next, using the identity cos  = 1 - sin  2 for - 2 <  < 2 ,   we see that
Equation:

                                            limcos  = lim1 - sin2 = 1.

                                            0          0

We  now  take  a  look  at  a  limit  that  plays  an  important  role  in  later  chapters--namely,  lim  sin    .  To  evaluate
                                                                                                              
                                                                                                      0

this limit, we use the unit circle in [link]. Notice that this figure adds one additional triangle to [link]. We

see that the length of the side opposite angle  in this new triangle is tan . Thus, we see that for

                                 

0 <  < , sin  <  < tan .

                                 2
The sine and tangent functions are shown as lines on
                       the unit circle.

By dividing by sin  in all parts of the inequality, we obtain
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                              1

                                   1<                                                                                                                      <        .

                                                                                                                                                     sin      cos 

Equivalently, we have
Equation:

                                   1>                                                                                                                sin   > cos .
                                                                                                                                                        

Since lim 1 = 1 = lim cos , we conclude that lim  = 1. sin By applying a manipulation similar to that
0+         0+                                                                                                                                        0+

used in demonstrating that  lim sin  = 0, we can show that                                                                                                    lim      sin   = 1. Thus,

In [link] we use this limit to establish lim 1-cos                                                                                                   = 0.

Note:
Deriving the Formula for the Area of a Circle
Some of the geometric formulas we take for granted today were first derived by methods that anticipate
some of the methods of calculus. The Greek mathematician Archimedes (ca. 287-212; BCE) was
particularly inventive, using polygons inscribed within circles to approximate the area of the circle as the
number of sides of the polygon increased. He never came up with the idea of a limit, but we can use this
idea to see what his geometric constructions could have predicted about the limit.
We can estimate the area of a circle by computing the area of an inscribed regular polygon. Think of the
regular polygon as being made up of n triangles. By taking the limit as the vertex angle of these triangles
goes to zero, you can obtain the area of the circle. To see this, carry out the following steps:

   1. Express the height h and the base b of the isosceles triangle in [link] in terms of  and r.

2. Using the expressions that you obtained in step 1, express the area of the isosceles triangle in terms of

 and r.

(Substitute (1 / 2) sin  for sin( / 2) cos( / 2) in your expression.)

3. If an n-sided regular polygon is inscribed in a circle of radius r, find a relationship between  and n.

Solve this for n. Keep in mind there are 2 radians in a circle. (Use radians, not degrees.)

4. Find an expression for the area of the n-sided polygon in terms of r and .

5. To find a formula for the area of the circle, find the limit of the expression in step 4 as  goes to zero.

(Hint: lim  (sin )

                    = 1).

The technique of estimating areas of regions by using polygons is revisited in Introduction to Integration.

Key Concepts

      The limit laws allow us to evaluate limits of functions without having to go through step-by-step
      processes each time.
      For polynomials and rational functions, limf (x) = f (a).

                                                                                                                                                    xa

      You can evaluate the limit of a function by factoring and canceling, by multiplying by a conjugate, or
      by simplifying a complex fraction.
      The squeeze theorem allows you to find the limit of a function if the function is always greater than
      one function and less than another function with limits that are known.

Continuity
      Explain the three conditions for continuity at a point.
      Describe three kinds of discontinuities.
      Define continuity on an interval.
      State the theorem for limits of composite functions.
      Provide an example of the intermediate value theorem.

Many functions have the property that their graphs can be traced with a pencil without lifting the pencil from the
page. Such functions are called continuous. Other functions have points at which a break in the graph occurs, but
satisfy this property over intervals contained in their domains. They are continuous on these intervals and are said
to have a discontinuity at a point where a break occurs.
We begin our investigation of continuity by exploring what it means for a function to have continuity at a point.
Intuitively, a function is continuous at a particular point if there is no break in its graph at that point.

Continuity at a Point

Before we look at a formal definition of what it means for a function to be continuous at a point, let's consider
various functions that fail to meet our intuitive notion of what it means to be continuous at a point. We then create
a list of conditions that prevent such failures.
Our first function of interest is shown in [link]. We see that the graph of f (x) has a hole at a. In fact, f (a) is
undefined. At the very least, for f (x) to be continuous at a, we need the following condition:
Equation:

                                                                                                                i. f (a) is def ined.

         The function f (x) is not
     continuous at a because f (a) is

                  undefined.

However, as we see in [link], this condition alone is insufficient to guarantee continuity at the point a. Although
f (a) is defined, the function has a gap at a. In this example, the gap exists because limf (x) does not exist. We

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    xa

must add another condition for continuity at a--namely,
Equation:

                                                                                                                ii. lim f (x) exists.

                                                                                                                                                                       xa
         The function f (x) is not
    continuous at a because limf (x)

                                                                                            xa

               does not exist.

However, as we see in [link], these two conditions by themselves do not guarantee continuity at a point. The
function in this figure satisfies both of our first two conditions, but is still not continuous at a. We must add a third
condition to our list:
Equation:

                                                                                                            iii. lim f (x) = f (a).

                                                                                                                                                                    xa

         The function f (x) is not
          continuous at a because

                         lim f (x)  f (a).

                                    xa

Now we put our list of conditions together and form a definition of continuity at a point.
Note:
Definition
A function f (x) is continuous at a point a if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:

   i. f (a) is defined
  ii. limf (x) exists

                xa

  iii. limf (x) = f (a)

                xa

A function is discontinuous at a point a if it fails to be continuous at a.

The following procedure can be used to analyze the continuity of a function at a point using this definition.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Determining Continuity at a Point

1. Check to see if f (a) is defined. If f (a) is undefined, we need go no further. The function is not continuous

at a. If f (a) is defined, continue to step 2.

2. Compute limf (x). In some cases, we may need to do this by first computing lim f (x) and lim f (x). If

xa                                                                        xa -  xa +

limf (x) does not exist (that is, it is not a real number), then the function is not continuous at a and the

xa

problem is solved. If limf (x) exists, then continue to step 3.

                                                                      xa

3. Compare f (a) and limf (x). If limf (x)  f (a), then the function is not continuous at a. If

    xa  xa

limf (x) = f (a), then the function is continuous at a.

The next three examples demonstrate how to apply this definition to determine whether a function is continuous at
a given point. These examples illustrate situations in which each of the conditions for continuity in the definition
succeed or fail.

   Using the definition, determine whether the function f (x) = (x2 - 4)/(x - 2) is continuous at x = 2.
   Justify the conclusion.

   Solution:

   Let's begin by trying to calculate f (2). We can see that f (2) = 0/0, which is undefined. Therefore,
   f (x) = x-2 x2-4 is discontinuous at 2 because f (2) is undefined. The graph of f (x) is shown in [link].

Using the definition, determine whether the function f (x) = {                                                                                                                                                                    if x > 3

Justify the conclusion.

Solution:

Let's begin by trying to calculate f (3).
Equation:

                                                                                      2

                                           f (3) = -(3 ) + 4 = -5.

Thus, f (3) is defined. Next, we calculate limf (x). To do this, we must compute lim f (x) and lim f (x):

                                           x3                                                                                                                                                                                     x3-  x3+

Equation:

                                                                       2

            lim f (x) = -(3 ) + 4 = -5

           x3-

and
Equation:

                                            lim f (x) = 4 (3) - 8 = 4.

                                           x3+
   Therefore, limf (x) does not exist. Thus, f (x) is not continuous at 3. The graph of f (x) is shown in [link].

                                            x3

         The function f (x) is not continuous at 3 because
                         limf (x) does not exist.

   First, observe that
   Equation:

                                                                                                                         f (0) = 1.

   Next,

  Last, compare f (0) and limf (x). We see that

  Equation:

                                                                        f (0) = 1 = limf (x).

                                                                                                                                                                                            x0

  Since all three of the conditions in the definition of continuity are satisfied, f (x) is continuous at x = 0.

By applying the definition of continuity and previously established theorems concerning the evaluation of limits,
we can state the following theorem.

Note:
Continuity of Polynomials and Rational Functions
Polynomials and rational functions are continuous at every point in their domains.

Proof

Previously, we showed that if p (x) and q (x) are polynomials, limp (x) = p (a) for every polynomial p (x) and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                xa

    p(x)               p(a)  as long as q (a)  0. Therefore, polynomials and rational functions are continuous on their

Types of Discontinuities

As we have seen in [link] and [link], discontinuities take on several different appearances. We classify the types of
discontinuities we have seen thus far as removable discontinuities, infinite discontinuities, or jump discontinuities.
Intuitively, a removable discontinuity is a discontinuity for which there is a hole in the graph, a jump
discontinuity is a noninfinite discontinuity for which the sections of the function do not meet up, and an infinite
discontinuity is a discontinuity located at a vertical asymptote. [link] illustrates the differences in these types of
discontinuities. Although these terms provide a handy way of describing three common types of discontinuities,
keep in mind that not all discontinuities fit neatly into these categories.

           Discontinuities are classified as (a) removable, (b) jump, or (c) infinite.
These three discontinuities are formally defined as follows:

Note:
Definition
If f (x) is discontinuous at a, then

1. f has a removable discontinuity at a if limf (x) exists. (Note: When we state that limf (x) exists, we

                                           xa                                                                                                                                          xa

mean that limf (x) = L, where L is a real number.)

                                  xa

2. f has a jump discontinuity at a if lim f (x) and lim f (x) both exist, but lim f (x)  lim f (x). (Note:

                                      xa-        xa+                                                                                                                              xa-      xa+

When we state that lim f (x) and lim f (x) both exist, we mean that both are real-valued and that neither

           xa-                        xa+

take on the values ±.)

3. f has an infinite discontinuity at a if lim f (x) = ± or lim f (x) = ±.

                                      xa-                                                                                                                                    xa+

To classify the discontinuity at 2 we must evaluate limf (x):

                                                                                                                                                                         x2

Equation:

                                      lim f (x)                         x2 -4

                                      x2         = lim

                                                          x2 x-2

                                                              (x-2)(x+2)

                                                 = lim                                                                                                                       x-2

                                                          x2

                                                 = lim (x + 2)

                                                          x2

                                                 = 4.

Since f is discontinuous at 2 and limf (x) exists, f has a removable discontinuity at x = 2.

                                                                                                            x2

In [link], we showed that f (x) = {                                                                       is discontinuous at x = 3. Classify this

Solution:

Earlier, we showed that f is discontinuous at 3 because limf (x) does not exist. However, since

                                                                                                                                                                                      x3

lim f (x) = -5 and lim f (x) = 4 both exist, we conclude that the function has a jump discontinuity at 3.

   Classifying a Discontinuity

Determine whether f (x) =                   x+2  is continuous at -1. If the function is discontinuous at -1, classify the

Solution:

The function value f (-1) is undefined. Therefore, the function is not continuous at -1. To determine the

Continuity over an Interval

Now that we have explored the concept of continuity at a point, we extend that idea to continuity over an
interval. As we develop this idea for different types of intervals, it may be useful to keep in mind the intuitive idea
that a function is continuous over an interval if we can use a pencil to trace the function between any two points in
the interval without lifting the pencil from the paper. In preparation for defining continuity on an interval, we begin
by looking at the definition of what it means for a function to be continuous from the right at a point and
continuous from the left at a point.

Note:

Continuity from the Right and from the Left

A function f (x) is said to be continuous from the right at a if lim f (x) = f (a).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    xa+

A function f (x) is said to be continuous from the left at a if lim f (x) = f (a).

                                                                                                                                                                                                              xa-

A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. A function f (x) is
continuous over a closed interval of the form [a, b] if it is continuous at every point in (a, b) and is continuous
from the right at a and is continuous from the left at b. Analogously, a function f (x) is continuous over an interval
of the form (a, b] if it is continuous over (a, b) and is continuous from the left at b. Continuity over other types of
intervals are defined in a similar fashion.

Requiring that lim f (x) = f (a) and lim f (x) = f (b) ensures that we can trace the graph of the function from

                           xa+     xb-

the point (a, f (a)) to the point (b, f (b)) without lifting the pencil. If, for example, lim f (x)  f (a), we would

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     xa+

need to lift our pencil to jump from f (a) to the graph of the rest of the function over (a, b].

                                                       x2 +2x

Solution:

Since f (x) =                 x-1  is a rational function, it is continuous at every point in its domain. The domain of f (x)
                           x2 +2x

is the set (-, -2)  (-2, 0)  (0, +). Thus, f (x) is continuous over each of the intervals

(-, -2), (-2, 0), and (0, +).

From the limit laws, we know that lim4 - x2 = 4 - a2 for all values of a in (-2, 2). We also know

                                                                                                                   xa

that lim 4 - x2 = 0 exists and lim 4 - x2 = 0 exists. Therefore, f (x) is continuous over the

Before we move on to [link], recall that earlier, in the section on limit laws, we showed limcos x = 1 = cos (0).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  x0

Consequently, we know that f (x) = cos x is continuous at 0. In [link] we see how to combine this result with the

composite function theorem.

f (x) = sin x is continuous at 0. Use [link] as a guide.

The proof of the next theorem uses the composite function theorem as well as the continuity of f (x) = sin x and
g (x) = cos x at the point 0 to show that trigonometric functions are continuous over their entire domains.

Note:
Continuity of Trigonometric Functions
Trigonometric functions are continuous over their entire domains.

Proof

We begin by demonstrating that cos x is continuous at every real number. To do this, we must show that
limcos x = cos a for all values of a.

           = 1  cos a - 0  sin a = cos a.

The proof that sin x is continuous at every real number is analogous. Because the remaining trigonometric
functions may be expressed in terms of sin x and cos x, their continuity follows from the quotient limit law.



As you can see, the composite function theorem is invaluable in demonstrating the continuity of trigonometric
functions. As we continue our study of calculus, we revisit this theorem many times.

The Intermediate Value Theorem

Functions that are continuous over intervals of the form [a, b], where a and b are real numbers, exhibit many useful
properties. Throughout our study of calculus, we will encounter many powerful theorems concerning such
functions. The first of these theorems is the Intermediate Value Theorem.
Note:
The Intermediate Value Theorem
Let f be continuous over a closed, bounded interval [a, b]. If z is any real number between f (a) and f (b), then
there is a number c in [a, b] satisfying f (c) = z in [link].

There is a number c  [a, b] that satisfies

                                   f (c) = z.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Application of the Intermediate Value Theorem

   Show that f (x) = x - cos x has at least one zero.

   Solution:

   Since f (x) = x - cos x is continuous over (-, +), it is continuous over any closed interval of the
   form [a, b]. If you can find an interval [a, b] such that f (a) and f (b) have opposite signs, you can use the
   Intermediate Value Theorem to conclude there must be a real number c in (a, b) that satisfies f (c) = 0. Note
   that
   Equation:

                                                                                                f (0) = 0 - cos (0) = -1 < 0

and
Equation:

                                                               

           f( ) =                                 - cos     =     > 0.

           2                                   2         2     2

Using the Intermediate Value Theorem, we can see that there must be a real number c in [0, /2] that
satisfies f (c) = 0. Therefore, f (x) = x - cos x has at least one zero.
Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   When Can You Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem?

   If f (x) is continuous over [0, 2], f (0) > 0 and f (2) > 0, can we use the Intermediate Value Theorem to
   conclude that f (x) has no zeros in the interval [0, 2]? Explain.

   Solution:

   No. The Intermediate Value Theorem only allows us to conclude that we can find a value between f (0) and
   f (2); it doesn't allow us to conclude that we can't find other values. To see this more clearly, consider the
   function f (x) = (x - 1) . 2 It satisfies f (0) = 1 > 0, f (2) = 1 > 0, and f (1) = 0.

Example:
Exercise:

   When Can You Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem?

   interval [-1, 1]?

   Solution:

   No. The function is not continuous over [-1, 1]. The Intermediate Value Theorem does not apply here.

   Solution:
   f (0) = 1 > 0, f (1) = -2 < 0; f (x) is continuous over [0, 1]. It must have a zero on this interval.
Hint
Find f (0) and f (1). Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem.

Key Concepts

For a function to be continuous at a point, it must be defined at that point, its limit must exist at the point, and
the value of the function at that point must equal the value of the limit at that point.
Discontinuities may be classified as removable, jump, or infinite.
A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. It is continuous
over a closed interval if it is continuous at every point in its interior and is continuous at its endpoints.
The composite function theorem states: If f (x) is continuous at L and limg (x) = L, then

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          xa

lim f (g (x)) = f (lim g (x)) = f (L).

      The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that if a function is continuous over a closed interval, then the
      function takes on every value between the values at its endpoints.
For the following exercises, determine the point(s), if any, at which each function is discontinuous. Classify any
discontinuity as jump, removable, infinite, or other.

In the following exercises, use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT).

                                  5 + 4x,

h (0) < 10 and h (4) > 10. Explain why this does not contradict the IVT.

Exercise:

Problem:

A particle moving along a line has at each time t a position function s (t), which is continuous. Assume
s (2) = 5 and s (5) = 2. Another particle moves such that its position is given by h (t) = s (t) - t. Explain
why there must be a value c for 2 < c < 5 such that h (c) = 0.

   Solution:

   Since both s and y = t are continuous everywhere, then h (t) = s (t) - t is continuous everywhere and, in
   particular, it is continuous over the closed interval [2, 5]. Also, h (2) = 3 > 0 and h (5) = -3 < 0.
   Therefore, by the IVT, there is a value x = c such that h (c) = 0.

The Precise Definition of a Limit

      Describe the epsilon-delta definition of a limit.
      Apply the epsilon-delta definition to find the limit of a function.
      Describe the epsilon-delta definitions of one-sided limits and infinite limits.
      Use the epsilon-delta definition to prove the limit laws.

By now you have progressed from the very informal definition of a limit in the introduction of this
chapter to the intuitive understanding of a limit. At this point, you should have a very strong intuitive
sense of what the limit of a function means and how you can find it. In this section, we convert this
intuitive idea of a limit into a formal definition using precise mathematical language. The formal
definition of a limit is quite possibly one of the most challenging definitions you will encounter early
in your study of calculus; however, it is well worth any effort you make to reconcile it with your
intuitive notion of a limit. Understanding this definition is the key that opens the door to a better
understanding of calculus.

Quantifying Closeness

Before stating the formal definition of a limit, we must introduce a few preliminary ideas. Recall that
the distance between two points a and b on a number line is given by |a - b|.

      The statement |f (x) - L| <  may be interpreted as: The distance between f (x) and L is less
      than .
      The statement 0 < |x - a| <  may be interpreted as: x  a and the distance between x and a
      is less than .

It is also important to look at the following equivalences for absolute value:

      The statement |f (x) - L| <  is equivalent to the statement L -  < f (x) < L + .
      The statement 0 < |x - a| <  is equivalent to the statement a -  < x < a +  and x  a.

With these clarifications, we can state the formal epsilon-delta definition of the limit.

Note:
Definition
Let f(x) be defined for all x  a over an open interval containing a. Let L be a real number. Then
Equation:

                                                                                                      lim f (x) = L

                                                                                                                                                xa

if, for every  > 0, there exists a  > 0, such that if 0 < |x - a| < , then |f(x) - L| < .

This definition may seem rather complex from a mathematical point of view, but it becomes easier to
understand if we break it down phrase by phrase. The statement itself involves something called a
universal quantifier (for every  > 0), an existential quantifier (there exists a  > 0), and, last, a
conditional statement (if 0 < |x - a| < , then |f (x) - L| < ). Let's take a look at [link], which
breaks down the definition and translates each part.

Definition                  Translation

1. For every  > 0,          1. For every positive distance  from L,

2. there exists a  > 0,     2. There is a positive distance  from a,

3. such that                3. such that

4. if 0 < |x - a| < , then  4. if x is closer than  to a and x  a, then f (x) is
                            closer than  to L.
|f (x) - L| < .

Translation of the Epsilon-Delta Definition of the Limit

We can get a better handle on this definition by looking at the definition geometrically. [link] shows
possible values of  for various choices of  > 0 for a given function f (x), a number a, and a limit L
at a. Notice that as we choose smaller values of  (the distance between the function and the limit),
we can always find a  small enough so that if we have chosen an x value within  of a, then the
value of f (x) is within  of the limit L.

            These graphs show possible values of , given successively smaller choices of .

Visit the following applet to experiment with finding values of  for selected values of :

      The epsilon-delta definition of limit

[link] shows how you can use this definition to prove a statement about the limit of a specific
function at a specified value.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Proving a Statement about the Limit of a Specific Function

   Prove that lim (2x + 1) = 3.

                                             x1

   Solution:

   Let  > 0.

   The first part of the definition begins "For every  > 0." This means we must prove that
   whatever follows is true no matter what positive value of  is chosen. By stating "Let  > 0,"
   we signal our intent to do so.

   Choose  = 2 . 
   The definition continues with "there exists a  > 0." The phrase "there exists" in a
   mathematical statement is always a signal for a scavenger hunt. In other words, we must go and
   find . So, where exactly did  = /2 come from? There are two basic approaches to tracking
   down . One method is purely algebraic and the other is geometric.

   We begin by tackling the problem from an algebraic point of view. Since ultimately we want
   |(2x + 1) - 3| < , we begin by manipulating this expression: |(2x + 1) - 3| <  is
   equivalent to |2x - 2| < , which in turn is equivalent to |2| |x - 1| < . Last, this is
   equivalent to |x - 1| < /2. Thus, it would seem that  = /2 is appropriate.

   We may also find  through geometric methods. [link] demonstrates how this is done.
          This graph shows how we find  geometrically.

Assume 0 < |x - 1| < . When  has been chosen, our goal is to show that if
0 < |x - 1| < , then |(2x + 1) - 3| < . To prove any statement of the form "If this, then
that," we begin by assuming "this" and trying to get "that."

Thus,

|(2x + 1) - 3| = |2x - 2|  property of absolute value
                           |2| = 2
          = |2 (x - 1)|    here's where we use the assumption that 0 < |x - 1| < 
                           here's where we use our choice of  = /2
          = |2| |x - 1|

          = 2 |x - 1|

          < 2

          = 2     =

               2

Analysis

In this part of the proof, we started with |(2x + 1) - 3| and used our assumption 0 < |x - 1| <  in
a key part of the chain of inequalities to get |(2x + 1) - 3| to be less than . We could just as easily
have manipulated the assumed inequality 0 < |x - 1| <  to arrive at |(2x + 1) - 3| <  as
follows:
0 < |x - 1| <   |x - 1| < 

 - < x - 1 < 

                                                                                 

 - < x-1 <                                                                       2
2

 - < 2x - 2 < 

 - < 2x - 2 < 

 |2x - 2| < 

 |(2x + 1) - 3| < .

Therefore, lim (2x + 1) = 3. (Having completed the proof, we state what we have accomplished.)

                                    x1

After removing all the remarks, here is a final version of the proof:
Let  > 0.
Choose  = /2.
Assume 0 < |x - 1| < .
Thus,

|(2x + 1) - 3| = |2x - 2|

                                        = |2 (x - 1)|

                                        = |2| |x - 1|

                                        = 2 |x - 1|

                                        < 2

                                                                              

                                        = 2

                                                                              2

                                        = .

Therefore, lim (2x + 1) = 3.

                                    x1

The following Problem-Solving Strategy summarizes the type of proof we worked out in [link].

   2. Next, we need to obtain a value for . After we have obtained this value, we make the

      following statement, filling in the blank with our choice of : Choose  = _______.
   3. The next statement in the proof should be (at this point, we fill in our given value for a):

      Assume 0 < |x - a| < .
   4. Next, based on this assumption, we need to show that |f (x) - L| < , where f (x) and L are

      our function f (x) and our limit L. At some point, we need to use 0 < |x - a| < .
5. We conclude our proof with the statement: Therefore, limf (x) = L.

                                                                                                                                                                                           xa

   Let _____.

   Choose  = _______.

   Assume 0 < |x- _______ | < .

   Thus, |________ - ________| =_____________________________________ .

Solution:

We begin by filling in the blanks where the choices are specified by the definition. Thus, we
have

Let  > 0.

Choose  = _______.

Assume 0 < |x - (-1)| < . (or equivalently, 0 < |x + 1| < .)

Thus, |(4x + 1) - (-3)| = |4x + 4| = |4| |x + 1| < 4_______.

Focusing on the final line of the proof, we see that we should choose  =                                                                                                                       

                                                                                                                                                                                                  .

                                                                                                                                                                                               4

We now complete the final write-up of the proof:

Let  > 0.

Choose  = 4 . 
Assume 0 < |x - (-1)| <  (or equivalently, 0 < |x + 1| < .)

Thus, |(4x + 1) - (-3)| = |4x + 4| = |4| |x + 1| < 4 = 4 (/4) = .

   Solution:
   Let  > 0; choose  = 3 ;  assume 0 < |x - 2| < .
   Thus, |(3x - 2) - 4| = |3x - 6| = |3|  |x - 2| < 3   = 3  (/3) = .

   Therefore, lim3x - 2 = 4.

Hint

Follow the outline in the Problem-Solving Strategy that we worked out in full in [link].

In [link] and [link], the proofs were fairly straightforward, since the functions with which we were
working were linear. In [link], we see how to modify the proof to accommodate a nonlinear function.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Proving a Statement about the Limit of a Specific Function (Geometric Approach)

   Prove that limx2 = 4.

                                             x2

   Solution:

      1. Let  > 0. The first part of the definition begins "For every  > 0," so we must prove that
         whatever follows is true no matter what positive value of  is chosen. By stating "Let
          > 0," we signal our intent to do so.

      2. Without loss of generality, assume   4. Two questions present themselves: Why do we
         want   4 and why is it okay to make this assumption? In answer to the first question:
         Later on, in the process of solving for , we will discover that  involves the quantity
  4 - . Consequently, we need   4. In answer to the second question: If we can find
   > 0 that "works" for   4, then it will "work" for any  > 4 as well. Keep in mind
  that, although it is always okay to put an upper bound on , it is never okay to put a lower
  bound (other than zero) on .

3. Choose  = min {2 - 4 - , 4 +  - 2}. [link] shows how we made this choice of

     .

This graph shows how we find  geometrically for a given  for the
                               proof in [link].

4. We must show: If 0 < |x - 2| < , then |x2 - 4| < , so we must begin by assuming
  Equation:

                                                                                           0 < |x - 2| < .

We don't really need 0 < |x - 2| (in other words, x  2) for this proof. Since
0 < |x - 2| <   |x - 2| < , it is okay to drop 0 < |x - 2|.
Equation:

                                                                                           |x - 2| < .

Hence,
Equation:

           - < x - 2 < .

Recall that  = min {2 - 4 - , 4 +  - 2}. Thus,   2 - 4 -  and

consequently - (2 - 4 - )  -. We also use   4 +  - 2 here. We might ask
at this point: Why did we substitute 2 - 4 -  for  on the left-hand side of the
inequality and 4 +  - 2 on the right-hand side of the inequality? If we look at [link],
we see that 2 - 4 -  corresponds to the distance on the left of 2 on the x-axis and
4 +  - 2 corresponds to the distance on the right. Thus,
Equation:

                                         - (2 - 4 - )  - < x - 2 <   4 +  - 2.

We simplify the expression on the left:
Equation:

                                                           -2 + 4 -  < x - 2 < 4 +  - 2.

Then, we add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
Equation:

                                                                             4 -  < x < 4 + .

We square all parts of the inequality. It is okay to do so, since all parts of the inequality are
positive:
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                     2

                                                                                 4 -  < x < 4 + .

We subtract 4 from all parts of the inequality:
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                 2

                                                                                    - < x - 4 < .

  Last,               2
  Equation:
               |x - 4| < .
5. Therefore,
  Equation:                        2

                 lim x = 4.

Draw a graph similar to the one in [link].

The geometric approach to proving that the limit of a function takes on a specific value works quite
well for some functions. Also, the insight into the formal definition of the limit that this method
provides is invaluable. However, we may also approach limit proofs from a purely algebraic point of
view. In many cases, an algebraic approach may not only provide us with additional insight into the
definition, it may prove to be simpler as well. Furthermore, an algebraic approach is the primary tool
used in proofs of statements about limits. For [link], we take on a purely algebraic approach.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Proving a Statement about the Limit of a Specific Function (Algebraic Approach)

   Prove that lim (x2 - 2x + 3) = 6.

                                           x-1

Solution:

Let's use our outline from the Problem-Solving Strategy:

1. Let  > 0.

2. Choose  = min {1, /5}. This choice of  may appear odd at first glance, but it was

obtained by taking a look at our ultimate desired inequality:          2                                                                                                                                 < .

                                                               (x - 2x + 3) - 6

This inequality is equivalent to |x + 1|  |x - 3| < . At this point, the temptation simply

to choose  =        is very strong. Unfortunately, our choice of  must depend on  only
              x-3

and no other variable. If we can replace |x - 3| by a numerical value, our problem can be

resolved. This is the place where assuming   1 comes into play. The choice of   1

here is arbitrary. We could have just as easily used any other positive number. In some

proofs, greater care in this choice may be necessary. Now, since   1 and

|x + 1| <   1, we are able to show that |x - 3| < 5. Consequently,

|x + 1|  |x - 3| < |x + 1|  5. At this point we realize that we also need   /5. Thus,

we choose  = min {1, /5}.

3. Assume 0 < |x + 1| < . Thus,

Equation:

                                                          
                         |x+1|<1and|x+1|<                            
                                                                         .

                                                                     5

Since |x + 1| < 1, we may conclude that -1 < x + 1 < 1. Thus, by subtracting 4 from
all parts of the inequality, we obtain -5 < x - 3 < -1. Consequently, |x - 3| < 5. This
gives us
Equation:

                                2                             = |x + 1|  |x - 3| <  
                                                                                          5 = .
                        (x - 2x + 3) - 6

Therefore,
Equation:

                                                                  2

                                        lim (x - 2x + 3) = 6.

Let  > 0; choose  = min {1, /3}; assume 0 < |x - 1| < .

Since |x - 1| < 1, we may conclude that -1 < x - 1 < 1. Thus, 1 < x + 1 < 3. Hence,

|x + 1| < 3.

   Solution:

       x2 - 1 = |x - 1|  |x + 1| < /3  3 =

Use [link] as a guide.

You will find that, in general, the more complex a function, the more likely it is that the algebraic
approach is the easiest to apply. The algebraic approach is also more useful in proving statements
about limits.

Proving Limit Laws

We now demonstrate how to use the epsilon-delta definition of a limit to construct a rigorous proof of
one of the limit laws. The triangle inequality is used at a key point of the proof, so we first review
this key property of absolute value.

Note:
Definition
The triangle inequality states that if a and b are any real numbers, then |a + b|  |a| + |b|.

Proof

We prove the following limit law: If limf (x) = L and limg (x) = M, then

                                      xa                 xa

lim (f (x) + g (x)) = L + M .

xa

Let  > 0.

Choose 1 > 0 so that if 0 < |x - a| < 1, then |f (x) - L| < /2.

Choose 2 > 0 so that if 0 < |x - a| < 2, then |g (x) - M | < /2.
Choose  = min {1, 2}.
Assume 0 < |x - a| < .

Thus,
Equation:

               0 < |x - a| < 1 and 0 < |x - a| < 2.

Hence,
Equation:

           |(f (x) + g (x)) - (L + M )| = |(f (x) - L) + (g (x) - M )|

                                                    |f (x) - L| + |g (x) - M |

                                                   <     +     = .

We now explore what it means for a limit not to exist. The limit limf (x) does not exist if there is no

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    xa

real number L for which limf (x) = L. Thus, for all real numbers L, limf (x)  L. To understand

           xa                                                       xa

what this means, we look at each part of the definition of limf (x) = L together with its opposite. A

                                                                                                                                                                                             xa

Finally, we may state what it means for a limit not to exist. The limit limf (x) does not exist if for

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    xa

every real number L, there exists a real number  > 0 so that for all  > 0, there is an x satisfying
0 < |x - a| < , so that |f (x) - L|  . Let's apply this in [link] to show that a limit does not
exist.

Thus, for any value of L, lim  L.
                                                                                   x0 x

One-Sided and Infinite Limits

Just as we first gained an intuitive understanding of limits and then moved on to a more rigorous
definition of a limit, we now revisit one-sided limits. To do this, we modify the epsilon-delta
definition of a limit to give formal epsilon-delta definitions for limits from the right and left at a
point. These definitions only require slight modifications from the definition of the limit. In the
definition of the limit from the right, the inequality 0 < x - a <  replaces 0 < |x - a| < , which
ensures that we only consider values of x that are greater than (to the right of) a. Similarly, in the
definition of the limit from the left, the inequality - < x - a < 0 replaces 0 < |x - a| < , which
ensures that we only consider values of x that are less than (to the left of) a.

Note:

   Proving a Statement about a Limit From the Right

Prove that lim x - 4 = 0.

                                   x4+

Solution:

Let  > 0.

Choose     =     2  Since  we  ultimately  want  x - 4 - 0  < , we manipulate this inequality to

              .

get x - 4 <  or, equivalently, 0 < x - 4 < 2, making  = 2 a clear choice. We may also
determine  geometrically, as shown in [link].

This graph shows how we find  for the proof in

 Assume0<x-  4  <  .  Thus,              0  <  x  -  4  <     2  Hence,  0  <  x  -  4  <  .  Finally,

We conclude the process of converting our intuitive ideas of various types of limits to rigorous
formal definitions by pursuing a formal definition of infinite limits. To have limf (x) = +, we

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            xa

want the values of the function f (x) to get larger and larger as x approaches a. Instead of the
requirement that |f (x) - L| <  for arbitrarily small  when 0 < |x - a| <  for small enough ,
we want f (x) > M for arbitrarily large positive M when 0 < |x - a| <  for small enough . [link]
illustrates this idea by showing the value of  for successively larger values of M.
                     These graphs plot values of  for M to show that limf (x) = +.

Key Concepts

      The intuitive notion of a limit may be converted into a rigorous mathematical definition known
      as the epsilon-delta definition of the limit.
      The epsilon-delta definition may be used to prove statements about limits.
      The epsilon-delta definition of a limit may be modified to define one-sided limits.

In the following exercises, write the appropriate  -  definition for each of the given statements.

The Hennessey Venom GT is one of the fastest cars in the world. In 2014, it
reached a record-setting speed of 270.49 mph. It can go from 0 to 200 mph
in 14.51 seconds. The techniques in this chapter can be used to calculate the
acceleration the Venom achieves in this feat (see [link].)

Calculating velocity and changes in velocity are important uses of calculus,
but it is far more widespread than that. Calculus is important in all branches
of mathematics, science, and engineering, and it is critical to analysis in
business and health as well. In this chapter, we explore one of the main
tools of calculus, the derivative, and show convenient ways to calculate
derivatives. We apply these rules to a variety of functions in this chapter so
that we can then explore applications of these techniques.
Defining the Derivative
      Recognize the meaning of the tangent to a curve at a point.
      Calculate the slope of a tangent line.
      Identify the derivative as the limit of a difference quotient.
      Calculate the derivative of a given function at a point.
      Describe the velocity as a rate of change.
      Explain the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity.
      Estimate the derivative from a table of values.

Now that we have both a conceptual understanding of a limit and the practical ability to compute
limits, we have established the foundation for our study of calculus, the branch of mathematics in
which we compute derivatives and integrals. Most mathematicians and historians agree that calculus
was developed independently by the Englishman Isaac Newton (1643-1727) and the German
Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), whose images appear in [link]. When we credit Newton and Leibniz
with developing calculus, we are really referring to the fact that Newton and Leibniz were the first to
understand the relationship between the derivative and the integral. Both mathematicians benefited
from the work of predecessors, such as Barrow, Fermat, and Cavalieri. The initial relationship
between the two mathematicians appears to have been amicable; however, in later years a bitter
controversy erupted over whose work took precedence. Although it seems likely that Newton did,
indeed, arrive at the ideas behind calculus first, we are indebted to Leibniz for the notation that we
commonly use today.

                Newton and Leibniz are credited with developing calculus independently.
Tangent Lines

We begin our study of calculus by revisiting the notion of secant lines and tangent lines. Recall that
we used the slope of a secant line to a function at a point (a, f (a)) to estimate the rate of change, or
the rate at which one variable changes in relation to another variable. We can obtain the slope of the
secant by choosing a value of x near a and drawing a line through the points (a, f (a)) and
(x, f (x)), as shown in [link]. The slope of this line is given by an equation in the form of a
difference quotient:
Equation:

                       msec =               f (x) - f (a)
                                                                             .

                                                     x-a

We can also calculate the slope of a secant line to a function at a value a by using this equation and
replacing x with a + h, where h is a value close to 0. We can then calculate the slope of the line
through the points (a, f (a)) and (a + h, f (a + h)). In this case, we find the secant line has a slope
given by the following difference quotient with increment h:
Equation:

                       f (a + h) - f (a)                  f (a + h) - f (a)

               msec =                                =                                                  .
                                                                                h
                       a+h-a

Note:
Definition
Let f be a function defined on an interval I containing a. If x  a is in I, then
Equation:

                       Q=                   f (x) - f (a)
                                                    x-a

is a difference quotient.
Also, if h  0 is chosen so that a + h is in I, then
Equation:

                       Q=                   f (a + h) - f (a)
                                                               h

is a difference quotient with increment h.

These two expressions for calculating the slope of a secant line are illustrated in [link]. We will see
that each of these two methods for finding the slope of a secant line is of value. Depending on the
setting, we can choose one or the other. The primary consideration in our choice usually depends on
ease of calculation.

                      We can calculate the slope of a secant line in either of two ways.
In [link](a) we see that, as the values of x approach a, the slopes of the secant lines provide better
estimates of the rate of change of the function at a. Furthermore, the secant lines themselves
approach the tangent line to the function at a, which represents the limit of the secant lines. Similarly,
[link](b) shows that as the values of h get closer to 0, the secant lines also approach the tangent line.
The slope of the tangent line at a is the rate of change of the function at a, as shown in [link](c).
    The secant lines approach the tangent line (shown in green) as the second point approaches the
                                                          first.

Note:
You can use this site to explore graphs to see if they have a tangent line at a point.

In [link] we show the graph of f (x) = x and its tangent line at (1, 1) in a series of tighter intervals
about x = 1. As the intervals become narrower, the graph of the function and its tangent line appear
to coincide, making the values on the tangent line a good approximation to the values of the function
for choices of x close to 1. In fact, the graph of f(x) itself appears to be locally linear in the
immediate vicinity of x = 1.
For values of x close to 1, the graph of f (x) = x and its tangent line appear to coincide.

Formally we may define the tangent line to the graph of a function as follows.

Note:
Definition
Let f(x) be a function defined in an open interval containing a. The tangent line to f(x) at a is the
line passing through the point (a, f (a)) having slope
Equation:

                                                            f (x) - f (a)

                             mtan = lim                     x-a

                                                        xa

provided this limit exists.
Equivalently, we may define the tangent line to f (x) at a to be the line passing through the point
(a, f (a)) having slope
Equation:

                                                                  f (a + h) - f (a)

                                                mtan = lim

                                                             h0              h

provided this limit exists.

Just as we have used two different expressions to define the slope of a secant line, we use two
different forms to define the slope of the tangent line. In this text we use both forms of the definition.
As before, the choice of definition will depend on the setting. Now that we have formally defined a
tangent line to a function at a point, we can use this definition to find equations of tangent lines.

   Finding a Tangent Line

Find  the  equation    of          the    line  tangent  to  the  graph  of  f  (x)  =      2  at  x  =  3.

                                                                                        x

Solution:

First find the slope of the tangent line. In this example, use [link].
Equation:

                    f (x)-f (3)

mtan  = lim            x-3                                               Apply the def inition.

               x3                                                                                                                                  2

                             x2-9                                        Substitute f (x) = x and f (3) = 9.
                                                                         Factor the numerator to evaluate the limit.
      = lim

               x3 x-3

                    (x-3)(x+3)

      = lim            x-3                = lim (x + 3) = 6

               x3                                  x3

Next, find a point on the tangent line. Since the line is tangent to the graph of f(x) at x = 3, it
passes through the point (3, f (3)). We have f (3) = 9, so the tangent line passes through the
point (3, 9).

Using the point-slope equation of the line with the slope m = 6 and the point (3, 9), we obtain

the  line  y  -  9  =  6           (x  -  3).   Simplifying,  we  have   y   =  6x   -  9.     The    graph  of  f  (x)  =      2  and  its

                                                                                                                            x

We obtained the same value for the slope of the tangent line by using the other definition,
demonstrating that the formulas can be interchanged.

We   now  know  that  the      slope     of        the  tangent  line  is  -  1  .  To    find  the    equation      of  the  tangent  line,
                                                                              4

we also need a point on the line. We know that f (2) =                                 1  .  Since     the  tangent    line  passes
                                                                                       2

through   the  point  (2,   1  )     we  can       use  the  point-slope      equation          of  a  line  to  find  the   equation  of
                            2

the  tangent   line.  Thus     the   tangent       line  has  the  equation         y  =     -  1   x  +    1.  The  graphs   of

The Derivative of a Function at a Point

The type of limit we compute in order to find the slope of the line tangent to a function at a point
occurs in many applications across many disciplines. These applications include velocity and
acceleration in physics, marginal profit functions in business, and growth rates in biology. This limit
occurs so frequently that we give this value a special name: the derivative. The process of finding a
derivative is called differentiation.

Note:
Definition
Let f(x) be a function defined in an open interval containing a. The derivative of the function f(x)
at a, denoted by f  (a), is defined by
Equation:

                                                                          f (x) - f (a)

                                               

                                          f (a) = lim

provided this limit exists.
Alternatively, we may also define the derivative of f(x) at a as
Equation:

                                                                      f (a + h) - f (a)

                                          

                                          f (a) = lim                                    .

Velocities and Rates of Change

Now that we can evaluate a derivative, we can use it in velocity applications. Recall that if s (t) is
the position of an object moving along a coordinate axis, the average velocity of the object over a
time interval [a, t] if t > a or [t, a] if t < a is given by the difference quotient
Equation:

                                vave =  s (t) - s(a)
                                                                      .

                                                t-a

As the values of t approach a, the values of vave approach the value we call the instantaneous
velocity at a. That is, instantaneous velocity at a, denoted v (a), is given by
Equation:

                                            s (t) - s(a)

v (a) = s (a) = lim                                                      .

                                        ta  t-a

To better understand the relationship between average velocity and instantaneous velocity, see [link].
In this figure, the slope of the tangent line (shown in red) is the instantaneous velocity of the object at
time t = a whose position at time t is given by the function s (t). The slope of the secant line
(shown in green) is the average velocity of the object over the time interval [a, t].
   The slope of the secant line is the average velocity over
    the interval [a, t]. The slope of the tangent line is the
                       instantaneous velocity.

We can use [link] to calculate the instantaneous velocity, or we can estimate the velocity of a moving
object by using a table of values. We can then confirm the estimate by using [link].

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Estimating Velocity

   Solution:
We can estimate the instantaneous velocity at t = 0 by computing a table of average velocities
using values of t approaching 0, as shown in [link].

                                  sin t-sin 0  sin t
t t-0 t =

-0.1                              0.998334166

0.1                               0.998334166

Average velocities using values of t approaching 0

From the table we see that the average velocity over the time interval [-0.1, 0] is
0.998334166, the average velocity over the time interval [-0.01, 0] is 0.9999833333, and so
forth. Using this table of values, it appears that a good estimate is v (0) = 1.

By using [link], we can see that
Equation:

                                                          sin t - sin 0                  sin t  = 1.
                                                                         = lim
                                       
                                                                               t0 t
        v (0) = s (0) = lim

Thus, in fact, v (0) = 1.

As we have seen throughout this section, the slope of a tangent line to a function and instantaneous
velocity are related concepts. Each is calculated by computing a derivative and each measures the
instantaneous rate of change of a function, or the rate of change of a function at any point along the
function.

The instantaneous rate of change of a function f(x) at a value a is its derivative f (a).

        (credit: modification of work by
                 Codex41, Flickr)

   Reaching a top speed of 270.49 mph, the Hennessey Venom GT is one of the fastest cars in the
   world. In tests it went from 0 to 60 mph in 3.05 seconds, from 0 to 100 mph in 5.88 seconds,
   from 0 to 200 mph in 14.51 seconds, and from 0 to 229.9 mph in 19.96 seconds. Use this data
   to draw a conclusion about the rate of change of velocity (that is, its acceleration) as it
   approaches 229.9 mph. Does the rate at which the car is accelerating appear to be increasing,
   decreasing, or constant?

   Solution:
First observe that 60 mph = 88 ft/s, 100 mph  146.67 ft/s, 200 mph  293.33 ft/s, and 229.9
mph  337.19 ft/s. We can summarize the information in a table.

Now compute the average acceleration of the car in feet per second on intervals of the form
[t, 19.96] as t approaches 19.96, as shown in the following table.

           v(t)-v(19.96)  v(t)-337.19

The rate at which the car is accelerating is decreasing as its velocity approaches 229.9 mph
(337.19 ft/s).

   Problem:
   Rate of Change of Profit

   A toy company can sell x electronic gaming systems at a price of p = -0.01x + 400 dollars
   per gaming system. The cost of manufacturing x systems is given by C (x) = 100x + 10,000
   dollars. Find the rate of change of profit when 10,000 games are produced. Should the toy
   company increase or decrease production?

   Solution:

   The profit P (x) earned by producing x gaming systems is R (x) - C (x), where R (x) is the
   revenue obtained from the sale of x games. Since the company can sell x games at
   p = -0.01x + 400 per game,
   Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2

                                                   R (x) = xp = x (-0.01x + 400) = -0.01x + 400x.
Consequently,
Equation:

                                                                                                        2

                                               P (x) = -0.01x + 300x - 10,000.

Therefore, evaluating the rate of change of profit gives
Equation:

                                                                         P (x)-P (10000)

                         P (10000)                      = lim            x-10000

                                                                 x10000

                                                        =      lim       -0.01x2+300x-10000-1990000
                                                                                                       x-10000
                                                           x10000

                                                        =      lim       -0.01x2+300x-2000000
                                                                                             x-10000
                                                           x10000

                                                        = 100.

Since the rate of change of profit P  (10,000) > 0 and P (10,000) > 0, the company should
increase production.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem:

A coffee shop determines that the daily profit on scones obtained by charging s dollars per

scone  is  P  (s)  =                     2  +  150s  -  10.  The  coffee  shop  currently  charges              $3.25   per  scone.

                      -20s

Find  P            the  rate  of            change   of  profit  when    the  price  is   $3.25            and  decide  whether  or  not

          (3.25),

the coffee shop should consider raising or lowering its prices on scones.

Solution:

   P  (3.25) = 20 > 0; raise prices

Key Concepts

      The slope of the tangent line to a curve measures the instantaneous rate of change of a curve.
      We can calculate it by finding the limit of the difference quotient or the difference quotient with
      increment h.
      The derivative of a function f (x) at a value a is found using either of the definitions for the
      slope of the tangent line.
Velocity is the rate of change of position. As such, the velocity v (t) at time t is the derivative of
the position s (t) at time t. Average velocity is given by
Equation:

                                                              vave =  s (t) - s(a)
                                                                                                    .

                                                                              t-a

Instantaneous velocity is given by
Equation:

                                                                                   s (t) - s(a)

                                                              v (a) = s (a) = lim                      .

                                                                      ta           t-a

The Derivative as a Function

      Define the derivative function of a given function.
      Graph a derivative function from the graph of a given function.
      State the connection between derivatives and continuity.
      Describe three conditions for when a function does not have a derivative.
      Explain the meaning of a higher-order derivative.

As we have seen, the derivative of a function at a given point gives us the rate of change or slope of the tangent
line to the function at that point. If we differentiate a position function at a given time, we obtain the velocity at
that time. It seems reasonable to conclude that knowing the derivative of the function at every point would
produce valuable information about the behavior of the function. However, the process of finding the derivative
at even a handful of values using the techniques of the preceding section would quickly become quite tedious.
In this section we define the derivative function and learn a process for finding it.

Derivative Functions

The derivative function gives the derivative of a function at each point in the domain of the original function
for which the derivative is defined. We can formally define a derivative function as follows.

Note:

Definition

Let  f  be  a  function.  The  derivative  function,  denoted  by  f      is  the  function  whose  domain  consists  of  those

                                                                       ,

values of x such that the following limit exists:

Equation:

                                                          f (x + h) - f (x)

                                           f (x) = lim                             .

                                                      h0                  h

A function f(x) is said to be differentiable at a if f (a) exists. More generally, a function is said to be
differentiable on S if it is differentiable at every point in an open set S, and a differentiable function is one in
which f (x) exists on its domain.

In the next few examples we use [link] to find the derivative of a function.

f (x) = 2x
HintWe use a variety of different notations to express the derivative of a function. In [link] we showed that if

Use [link] and follow the example.f (x) = x2 - 2x, then f  (x) = 2x - 2. If we had expressed this function in the form y = x2 - 2x, we could

have expressed the derivative as y = 2x - 2 or dx = 2x - 2. dy We could have conveyed the same information

by writing   d  (x2  -  2x)  =  2x  -  2.  Thus,  for  the  function          y  =  f  (x),    each  of  the  following  notations
            dx

represents the derivative of f (x):

Equation:

                                                                                     (f (x)).

                                                       dx

In place of f  (a) we may also use dx dy                                                dy

                                                  Use of the dx notation (called Leibniz notation) is quite common in

                                           x=a

engineering and physics. To understand this notation better, recall that the derivative of a function at a point is

the limit of the slopes of secant lines as the secant lines approach the tangent line. The slopes of these secant

                                                                                                                            y

lines are often expressed in the form x where y is the difference in the y values corresponding to the

difference in the x values, which are expressed as x ([link]). Thus the derivative, which can be thought of as

the instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x, is expressed as

Equation:

                                                       dy                     y

derivative function, we could graph it. Given both, we would expect to see a correspondence between the

graphs  of  these  two  functions,       since  f        gives  the      rate  of  change     of  a  function  f   (x)  (or  slope  of  the  tangent

                                                    (x)

line to f(x) ).

In  [link]  we  found  that  for  f   (x)  =  x,   f           =  1/2x.           If  we  graph    these  functions     on   the  same  axes,  as  in

                                                          (x)

[link], we can use the graphs to understand the relationship between these two functions. First, we notice that

f(x) is increasing over its entire domain, which means that the slopes of its tangent lines at all points are

positive. Consequently, we expect f  (x) > 0 for all values of x in its domain. Furthermore, as x increases, the

slopes  of  the  tangent  lines   to  f  (x)  are  decreasing     and    we    expect     to  see    a  corresponding   decrease    in  f         We

                                                                                                                                            (x).

also observe that f (0) is undefined and that            lim             (x)   =   +,     corresponding        to  a  vertical  tangent  to  f (x)  at

                                                                  f

                                                         x0+

0.

     The derivative f (x) is positive everywhere because
                 the function f(x) is increasing.

In [link] we found that for f (x) = x2 - 2x, f  (x) = 2x - 2. The graphs of these functions are shown in
[link]. Observe that f(x) is decreasing for x < 1. For these same values of x, f  (x) < 0. For values of
x > 1, f(x) is increasing and f  (x) > 0. Also, f(x) has a horizontal tangent at x = 1 and f  (1) = 0.
   The derivative f  (x) < 0 where the function f (x) is
    decreasing and f  (x) > 0 where f(x) is increasing.

        The derivative is zero where the function has a
                         horizontal tangent.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Sketching a Derivative Using a Function
   Use the following graph of f (x) to sketch a graph of f  (x).
   Solution:
   The solution is shown in the following graph. Observe that f(x) is increasing and f  (x) > 0 on (- 2, 3).
   Also, f(x) is decreasing and f  (x) < 0 on (-, -2) and on (3, +). Also note that f(x) has
   horizontal tangents at - 2 and 3, and f  (-2) = 0 and f  (3) = 0.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem: Sketch the graph of f (x) = x2 - 4. On what interval is the graph of f  (x) above the x-axis?
   Solution:

      (0, +)

Hint
The graph of f (x) is positive where f(x) is increasing.

Derivatives and Continuity

Now that we can graph a derivative, let's examine the behavior of the graphs. First, we consider the relationship
between differentiability and continuity. We will see that if a function is differentiable at a point, it must be
continuous there; however, a function that is continuous at a point need not be differentiable at that point. In
fact, a function may be continuous at a point and fail to be differentiable at the point for one of several reasons.
Note:
Differentiability Implies Continuity
Let f(x) be a function and a be in its domain. If f(x) is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a.

Proof

If f(x) is differentiable at a, then f (a) exists and
Equation:

                                                                                   f (x) - f (a)

                                                     f (a) = lim                                             .

                                                                 xa                x-a

We want to show that f(x) is continuous at a by showing that limf(x) = f(a). Thus,

                                                                                                                                                                                                              xa

Equation:

lim f (x)    = lim (f (x) - f (a) + f (a))

xa                    xa

                               f (x)-f (a)

             = lim (                         (x - a) + f (a))                           Multiply and divide f (x) - f (a) by x - a.

                      xa       x-a

                               f (x)-f (a)

             = (lim            x-a          )  (lim (x - a)) + lim f (a)

                           xa               xa                   xa

             = f (a)  0 + f (a)

             = f (a ).

Therefore, since f (a) is defined and limf (x) = f(a), we conclude that f is continuous at a.

                                                                                                                           xa



We have just proven that differentiability implies continuity, but now we consider whether continuity implies

differentiability. To determine an answer to this question, we examine the function f (x) = |x|. This function is

continuous   everywhere;       however,     f        is  undefined.  This          observation                  leads  us  to  believe                                                                            that  continuity  does

                                                (0)

not imply differentiability. Let's explore further. For f (x) = |x|,

Equation:

                                                                    f (x) - f (0)                  |x| - |0|               |x|
                                                                                   = lim
                                                                                                                = lim           .
                                                                                         x0 x - 0
                                    f (0) = lim

                                               x0          x-0                                                     x0 x

This limit does not exist because
Equation:

                                                            |x|                                         |x|  = 1.

                                                 lim             = -1 and lim
                                                x0- x                                      x0+ x

See [link].
The function f (x) = |x| is continuous at 0 but is not
                     differentiable at 0.

Let's consider some additional situations in which a continuous function fails to be differentiable. Consider the

function   f  (x)  =     3

                      x:

Equation:

                                                                                                            3             1

                                                                         x - 0                                 = lim            = +.

                                                                                                                  x0 3       2
                                                                                                                          x
                                         f (0) = lim
                                                              x0 x - 0

Thus  f    (0)  does  not  exist.  A  quick   look  at  the  graph  of                                         f  (x)  =     3  clarifies  the  situation.  The  function  has  a

                                                                                                                          x

vertical tangent line at 0 ([link]).

      The  function   f    (x)  =     3  has  a  vertical  tangent  at

                                   x

x = 0. It is continuous at 0 but is not differentiable at
                              0.

The function f (x) = {                              1  also has a derivative that exhibits interesting behavior at 0. We see

                            x sin ( ) if x  0

                                                    x

                            0 if x = 0

that

Equation:

                                                                     x sin (1/x) - 0                                                1

                                                                                                                     = lim sin ( ).

                                     f (0) = lim

                                                 x0                                                        x-0              x0      x

This limit does not exist, essentially because the slopes of the secant lines continuously change direction as they
approach zero ([link]).

                                                                                                        1

The function f (x) = {x sin ( x ) if x  0 is

                                                        0 if x = 0

              not differentiable at 0.

In summary:

1. We observe that if a function is not continuous, it cannot be differentiable, since every differentiable

      function must be continuous. However, if a function is continuous, it may still fail to be differentiable.

2. We saw that f (x) = |x| failed to be differentiable at 0 because the limit of the slopes of the tangent lines

      on the left and right were not the same. Visually, this resulted in a sharp corner on the graph of the function

      at 0. From this we conclude that in order to be differentiable at a point, a function must be "smooth" at that

      point.

3.    As  we  saw  in  the  example  of  f  (x)  =     3  a                                                function  fails  to  be  differentiable  at  a  point  where  there  is  a

                                                    x,

      vertical tangent line.
4. As we saw with f (x) = {                        1  a function may fail to be differentiable at a point in more

                           x sin ( ) if x  0

complicated ways as well.

   Problem:
   A Piecewise Function that is Continuous and Differentiable

A toy company wants to design a track for a toy car that starts out along a parabolic curve and then

converts to a straight line ([link]). The function that describes the track is to have the form

           1  2

                x + bx + c if x < -10  where x and f(x) are in inches. For the car to move smoothly

f (x) = {

              - x + if x  -10
              4  2

along the track, the function f(x) must be both continuous and differentiable at -10. Find values of b

and c that make f(x) both continuous and differentiable.

 For the car to move smoothly along the track, the
function must be both continuous and differentiable.

Solution:

For the function to be continuous at x = -10, lim f (x) = f (-10). Thus, since

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 -

                        lim f (x) =            (-10) - 10b + c = 10 - 10b + c

                    x-10-              10

and f (-10) = 5, we must have 10 - 10b + c = 5. Equivalently, we have c = 10b - 5.

For the function to be differentiable at -10,
Equation:

                                                         f (x) - f (-10)

                                               x-10       x + 10

must exist. Since f (x) is defined using different rules on the right and the left, we must evaluate this
limit from the right and the left and then set them equal to each other:

Higher-Order Derivatives

The derivative of a function is itself a function, so we can find the derivative of a derivative. For example, the
derivative of a position function is the rate of change of position, or velocity. The derivative of velocity is the
rate of change of velocity, which is acceleration. The new function obtained by differentiating the derivative is
called the second derivative. Furthermore, we can continue to take derivatives to obtain the third derivative,
fourth derivative, and so on. Collectively, these are referred to as higher-order derivatives. The notation for
the higher-order derivatives of y = f(x) can be expressed in any of the following forms:

   Finding Acceleration

The position of a particle along a coordinate axis at time t (in seconds) is given by s (t) = 3t2 - 4t + 1

Solution:

Since v (t) = s(t) and a (t) = v (t) = s (t), we begin by finding the derivative of s(t) :

Key Concepts

The derivative of a function f(x) is the function whose value at x is f (x).

The graph of a derivative of a function f(x) is related to the graph of f(x). Where f(x) has a tangent line

with positive slope, f  (x) > 0. Where f(x) has a tangent line with negative slope, f  (x) < 0. Where

f (x)  has  a  horizontal  tangent  line,         (x)  =  0.

                                           f

If a function is differentiable at a point, then it is continuous at that point. A function is not differentiable

at a point if it is not continuous at the point, if it has a vertical tangent line at the point, or if the graph has a

sharp corner or cusp.

Higher-order derivatives are derivatives of derivatives, from the second derivative to the nth derivative.

Finding derivatives of functions by using the definition of the derivative can be a lengthy and, for certain

functions, a rather challenging process. For example, previously we found that                                       d                1  by using a

                                                                                                                    dx

process that involved multiplying an expression by a conjugate prior to evaluating a limit. The process that we

could use to evaluate    d            3  using  the    definition,   while  similar,  is  more                 complicated.   In  this  section,  we  develop
                        dx
                              (x)

rules for finding derivatives that allow us to bypass this process. We begin with the basics.

The Basic Rules

The  functions  f  (x)  =  c  and  g  (x)  =        n  where  n  is  a  positive  integer  are                 the  building  blocks  from  which  all

                                                x

polynomials and rational functions are constructed. To find derivatives of polynomials and rational functions

efficiently without resorting to the limit definition of the derivative, we must first develop formulas for

differentiating these basic functions.

The Constant Rule

We first apply the limit definition of the derivative to find the derivative of the constant function, f (x) = c. For
this function, both f (x) = c and f (x + h) = c, so we obtain the following result:
Equation:

                                                                                            f (x+h)-f (x)

                                                       f (x)         = lim

                                                                                                            h
                                                                              h0

                                                                                            c-c

                                                                     = lim

                                                                                               h
                                                                              h0

                                                                                             0

                                                                     = lim

                                                                                            h
                                                                              h0

                                                                     = lim 0 = 0.

                                                                              h0

The rule for differentiating constant functions is called the constant rule. It states that the derivative of a constant
function is zero; that is, since a constant function is a horizontal line, the slope, or the rate of change, of a constant
function is 0. We restate this rule in the following theorem.

Note:
The Constant Rule
Let c be a constant.
If f (x) = c, then f (c) = 0.
Alternatively, we may express this rule as
Equation:

                                                                      d
                                                                            (c) = 0.

                                                                     dx

                                               (x ) = 2x and         (x ) =
                                                                                       x    .

                                                                                   2

At this point, you might see a pattern beginning to develop for derivatives of the form dx d (xn). We continue our

examination  of  derivative  formulas   by  differentiating  power      functions  of  the  form  f   (x)  =      n  where  n  is  a

                                                                                                              x

positive integer. We develop formulas for derivatives of this type of function in stages, beginning with positive

integer powers. Before stating and proving the general rule for derivatives of functions of this form, we take a look

at a specific case,   d  (x3).  As  we  go  through  this  derivation,  pay  special   attention  to  the  portion   of  the   expression
                     dx

in boldface, as the technique used in this case is essentially the same as the technique used to prove the general

case.

As  we  shall     see,  the   procedure  for    finding        the  derivative  of  the  general  form   f  (x)  =      n  is  very  similar.  Although

                                                                                                                    x

it is often unwise to draw general conclusions from specific examples, we note that when we differentiate

f (x) = x3, the power on x becomes the coefficient of x2 in the derivative and the power on x in the derivative

decreases by 1. The following theorem states that the power rule holds for all positive integer powers of x. We

will eventually extend this result to negative integer powers. Later, we will see that this rule may also be extended

first to rational powers of x and then to arbitrary powers of x. Be aware, however, that this rule does not apply to

functions   in    which    a  constant   is  raised     to  a  variable  power,     such  as   f (x)  =      x

                                                                                                         3.

For  f  (x)  =      n  where  n  is  a  positive  integer,  we    have

                x

Equation:

                                                                                              n        n

                                                       f (x) = lim                                        .

                                                                     h0                    h

Equation:

                                     n     n      n-1             n                                 n                               n-1        n

                                                                                    n-2 2                             n-3 3
                Since (x + h) = x + nx                 h+( )x                           h +( )x                        h + ... + nxh     +h ,

                                                                  2                                 3

we see that
Equation:

                              n         n         n-1          n                              n                              n-1         n

                                                                                 n-2 2                          n-3 3
                       (x + h) - x = nx              h+( )x                        h +( )x                   h + ... + nxh            +h .

Next, divide both sides by h:

Thus,
Equation:

                       (x + h) - x                n-1       n                              n                                 n-2      n-1

Finally,

The Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules

We find our next differentiation rules by looking at derivatives of sums, differences, and constant multiples of
functions. Just as when we work with functions, there are rules that make it easier to find derivatives of functions
that we add, subtract, or multiply by a constant. These rules are summarized in the following theorem.

Note:
Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules
Let f(x) and g(x) be differentiable functions and k be a constant. Then each of the following equations holds.
Sum Rule. The derivative of the sum of a function f and a function g is the same as the sum of the derivative of f
and the derivative of g.
Equation:

                                 d                         d                 d
                                       (f (x) + g (x)) =         (f (x)) +         (g (x));

                                dx                        dx                dx

that is,
Equation:

                                                                                
              f or j (x) = f (x) + g (x), j (x) = f (x) + g (x).

Difference Rule. The derivative of the difference of a function f and a function g is the same as the difference of
the derivative of f and the derivative of g:
Equation:

                           d                         d                 d
                                 (f (x) - g (x)) =         (f (x)) -         (g (x));

                          dx                        dx                dx

that is,
Equation:

                                                                                   
                          f or j (x) = f (x) - g (x), j (x) = f (x) - g (x).

Constant Multiple Rule. The derivative of a constant k multiplied by a function f is the same as the constant
multiplied by the derivative:
Equation:

                                d                         d

                                    (kf (x)) = k              (f (x));

                                dx                        dx

that is,
Equation:

                                                                      
                          f or j (x) = kf (x), j (x) = kf (x).

Proof

We provide only the proof of the sum rule here. The rest follow in a similar manner.

For differentiable functions f (x) and g (x), we set j (x) = f (x) + g (x). Using the limit definition of the
derivative we have
Equation:

                                                          j (x + h) - j (x)

                              

                              j (x) = lim                                    .

                                               h0         h

By substituting j (x + h) = f (x + h) + g (x + h) and j (x) = f (x) + g (x), we obtain
Equation:

                              (f (x + h) + g (x + h)) - (f (x) + g (x))

                 j (x) = lim                                                           .

                          h0                              h

Rearranging and regrouping the terms, we have
Equation:

                                f (x + h) - f (x)             g (x + h) - g(x)

                 j (x) = lim (                            +                            ).

                          h0                   h                                h

We now apply the sum law for limits and the definition of the derivative to obtain
Equation:

                          f (x + h) - f (x)               g (x + h) - g(x)                 

           j (x) = lim (                       ) + lim (                             ) = f (x) + g (x).

   Problem:
   Applying the Constant Multiple Rule

   Find the derivative of g (x) = 3x2 and compare it to the derivative of f (x) = x2.

  Solution:

  We use the power rule directly:
  Equation:

                                                              d2             d2

                                        g (x) =                 (3x ) = 3          (x ) = 3 (2x) = 6x.

  Since  f  (x)  =      2  has  derivative  f          (x)  =  2x,  we  see  that  the  derivative  of  g  (x)  is  3  times  the  derivative  of

                    x

  f (x). This relationship is illustrated in [link].

                                   The derivative of g (x) is 3 times the derivative of f (x).

   Problem:
   Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line

   Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f (x) = x2 - 4x + 6 at x = 1.

   Solution:

   To find the equation of the tangent line, we need a point and a slope. To find the point, compute
   Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                             2

                                                                                                   f (1) = 1 - 4 (1) + 6 = 3.

   This gives us the point (1, 3). Since the slope of the tangent line at 1 is f  (1), we must first find f  (x).
   Using the definition of a derivative, we have
   Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                      

                                                                                                                  f (x) = 2x - 4

   so the slope of the tangent line is f  (1) = -2. Using the point-slope formula, we see that the equation of the
   tangent line is
   Equation:

                                                                                                            y - 3 = -2 (x - 1).

   Putting the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, we obtain
   Equation:
                                                          y = -2x + 5.

The Product Rule

Now that we have examined the basic rules, we can begin looking at some of the more advanced rules. The first

one examines the derivative of the product of two functions. Although it might be tempting to assume that the

derivative of the product is the product of the derivatives, similar to the sum and difference rules, the product rule

does  not  follow  this  pattern.  To  see  why  we  cannot  use  this  pattern,  consider  the  function  f  (x)  =      2  whose

                                          (f (x)g (x)) =         (f (x))  g (x) +         (g (x))  f (x).

That is,
Equation:

                                                                                            

                         if j (x) = f (x)g(x), then j (x) = f (x)g (x) + g (x)f (x).

This means that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second
function plus the derivative of the second function times the first function.

Proof

We begin by assuming that f(x) and g(x) are differentiable functions. At a key point in this proof we need to use
the fact that, since g(x) is differentiable, it is also continuous. In particular, we use the fact that since g(x) is
continuous, limg (x + h) = g(x).

                                        h0

By applying the limit definition of the derivative to j (x) = f (x)g (x), we obtain
Equation:
                                         f (x + h)g (x + h) - f (x)g (x)

                            j (x) = lim                                                 .

                                     h0                                 h

By adding and subtracting f (x)g(x + h) in the numerator, we have
Equation:

                                         f (x + h)g (x + h) - f (x)g (x + h) + f (x)g (x + h) - f (x)g (x)

             

             j (x) = lim                                                                                    .

                        h0                                              h

After breaking apart this quotient and applying the sum law for limits, the derivative becomes
Equation:

                        f (x + h)g (x + h) - f (x)g (x + h)                             f (x)g (x + h) - f (x)g (x)

  j (x) = lim (                                                         ) + lim (                                    ).

             h0                      h                                       h0            h

Rearranging, we obtain
Equation:

                                                 f (x + h) - f (x)                      g (x + h) - g (x)

                                                                     g(x + h)) + lim (                      f (x)).

             j (x) = lim (

                        h0      h                                            h0         h

By using the continuity of g (x), the definition of the derivatives of f(x) and g(x), and applying the limit laws, we
arrive at the product rule,
Equation:

                                                                           

                                   j (x) = f (x)g (x) + g (x)f (x).

     g (2) = 6.

  Solution:

  Since j (x) = f (x)g (x), j (x) = f  (x)g (x) + g (x)f(x), and hence

                        j (2) = f (2)g (2) + g (2)f (2) = (-4) (1) + (6) (3) = 14.

Applying the Product Rule to Binomials

For j (x) = (x2 + 2)(3x3 - 5x), find j(x) by applying the product rule. Check the result by first finding
the product and then differentiating.

Solution:

If we set f (x) = x2 + 2 and g (x) = 3x3 - 5x, then f  (x) = 2x and g (x) = 9x2 - 5. Thus,
Equation:

                                                                                              3                      2  2
                            j (x) = f (x)g (x) + g (x)f (x) = (2x) (3x - 5x) + (9x - 5)(x + 2).

Simplifying, we have
Equation:

                                                                               4           2

To check, we see that j (x) = 3x5 + x3 - 10x and, consequently, j (x) = 15x4 + 3x2 - 10.

The Quotient Rule

Having developed and practiced the product rule, we now consider differentiating quotients of functions. As we
see in the following theorem, the derivative of the quotient is not the quotient of the derivatives; rather, it is the
derivative of the function in the numerator times the function in the denominator minus the derivative of the
function in the denominator times the function in the numerator, all divided by the square of the function in the
denominator. In order to better grasp why we cannot simply take the quotient of the derivatives, keep in mind that
Equation:

                                                                               d        3                 2

If k is a negative integer, we may set n = -k, so that n is a positive integer with k = -n. Since for each positive

integer n, x-n =        1  ,  we  may  now  apply    the  quotient  rule  by  setting   f  (x)                 =  1  and  g  (x)  =      n  In  this  case,

f  (x) = 0 and g (x) = nxn-1. Thus,

Equation:

                                                                          n             n-1

It may seem tempting to use the quotient rule to find this derivative, and it would certainly not be incorrect to

do  so.  However,  it  is  far   easier  to  differentiate  this  function  by  first  rewriting  it  as  f  (x)  =           -2

Combining Differentiation Rules

As we have seen throughout the examples in this section, it seldom happens that we are called on to apply just one
differentiation rule to find the derivative of a given function. At this point, by combining the differentiation rules,
we may find the derivatives of any polynomial or rational function. Later on we will encounter more complex
combinations of differentiation rules. A good rule of thumb to use when applying several rules is to apply the rules
in reverse of the order in which we would evaluate the function.

   Determining Where a Function Has a Horizontal Tangent

Determine  the  values  of  x  for  which  f                     (x)  =      3  -                                 2  +      8x  +  1  has  a  horizontal  tangent  line.

                                                                         x                               7x

Solution:

To find the values of x for which f(x) has a horizontal tangent line, we must solve f  (x) = 0. Since
Equation:

                                                                      2
                                    f (x) = 3x - 14x + 8 = (3x - 2) (x - 4),

we must solve (3x - 2) (x - 4) = 0. Thus we see that the function has horizontal tangent lines at x =                                                                        2

and x = 4 as shown in the following graph.

                                                        1 (t + 1) - 2t(t)               1-t

                                                  

                                             s (t) =                                 =                      .

Note:
Formula One Grandstands
Formula One car races can be very exciting to watch and attract a lot of spectators. Formula One track designers
have to ensure sufficient grandstand space is available around the track to accommodate these viewers. However,
car racing can be dangerous, and safety considerations are paramount. The grandstands must be placed where
spectators will not be in danger should a driver lose control of a car ([link]).

   The grandstand next to a straightaway of the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya race track, located where the
                                                  spectators are not in danger.

**********

Safety is especially a concern on turns. If a driver does not slow down enough before entering the turn, the car

may slide off the racetrack. Normally, this just results in a wider turn, which slows the driver down. But if the

driver loses control completely, the car may fly off the track entirely, on a path tangent to the curve of the

racetrack.

Suppose you are designing a new Formula One track. One section of the track can be modeled by the function

f  (x)  =      3  +           2  +  x  ([link]).  The  current  plan  calls  for  grandstands  to  be  built  along  the  first  straightaway  and

           x         3x

around a portion of the first curve. The plans call for the front corner of the grandstand to be located at the point

(-1.9, 2.8). We want to determine whether this location puts the spectators in danger if a driver loses control of

the car.
    (a) One section of the racetrack can be modeled by the function f (x) = x3 + 3x2 + x. (b) The front
                                   corner of the grandstand is located at (-1.9, 2.8).

   1. Physicists have determined that drivers are most likely to lose control of their cars as they are coming into a
      turn, at the point where the slope of the tangent line is 1. Find the (x, y) coordinates of this point near the
      turn.

   2. Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at this point.
   3. To determine whether the spectators are in danger in this scenario, find the x-coordinate of the point where

      the tangent line crosses the line y = 2.8. Is this point safely to the right of the grandstand? Or are the
      spectators in danger?
   4. What if a driver loses control earlier than the physicists project? Suppose a driver loses control at the point
      (-2.5, 0.625). What is the slope of the tangent line at this point?
   5. If a driver loses control as described in part 4, are the spectators safe?
   6. Should you proceed with the current design for the grandstand, or should the grandstands be moved?

Key Concepts

      The derivative of a constant function is zero.
      The derivative of a power function is a function in which the power on x becomes the coefficient of the term
      and the power on x in the derivative decreases by 1.
      The derivative of a constant c multiplied by a function f is the same as the constant multiplied by the
      derivative.
      The derivative of the sum of a function f and a function g is the same as the sum of the derivative of f and the
      derivative of g.
      The derivative of the difference of a function f and a function g is the same as the difference of the derivative
      of f and the derivative of g.
      The derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function
      plus the derivative of the second function times the first function.
      The derivative of the quotient of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function
      minus the derivative of the second function times the first function, all divided by the square of the second
       function.
       We used the limit definition of the derivative to develop formulas that allow us to find derivatives without
       resorting to the definition of the derivative. These formulas can be used singly or in combination with each
       other.

For  the  following  exercises,               find  f        for                                                each  function.

      Determine a new value of a quantity from the old value and the
      amount of change.
      Calculate the average rate of change and explain how it differs from
      the instantaneous rate of change.

      Use derivatives to calculate marginal cost and revenue in a business

In this section we look at some applications of the derivative by focusing on
the interpretation of the derivative as the rate of change of a function. These
applications include acceleration and velocity in physics, population
growth rates in biology, and marginal functions in economics.

Amount of Change Formula

One application for derivatives is to estimate an unknown value of a
function at a point by using a known value of a function at some given point
together with its rate of change at the given point. If f(x) is a function
defined on an interval [a, a + h], then the amount of change of f(x) over
the interval is the change in the y values of the function over that interval
and is given by
Equation:

                                                                   f (a + h) - f (a).

The average rate of change of the function f over that same interval is the
ratio of the amount of change over that interval to the corresponding change
in the x values. It is given by
Equation:
                                 f (a + h) - f (a)
                                                                            .

                                                    h

As we already know, the instantaneous rate of change of f(x) at a is its
derivative
Equation:

                                         f (a + h) - f (a)

                    f (a) = lim                                                   .

                                     h0          h

For small enough values of h, f  (a)  h . f(a+h)-f(a) We can then solve for
f (a + h) to get the amount of change formula:
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                        

                                                       f (a + h)  f (a) + f (a)h.

We  can  use  this  formula  if  we  know  only  f (a)  and                    f        and  wish  to

                                                                                   (a)

estimate the value of f (a + h). For example, we may use the current

population of a city and the rate at which it is growing to estimate its

population in the near future. As we can see in [link], we are approximating

f(a + h) by the y coordinate at a + h on the line tangent to f(x) at x = a.

Observe that the accuracy of this estimate depends on the value of h as well

as the value of f  (a).
      The new value of a changed quantity equals the
       original value plus the rate of change times the
     interval of change: f (a + h)  f (a) + f  (a)h.

Note:
Here is an interesting demonstration of rate of change.

   If f (3) = 2 and f  (3) = 5, estimate f(3.2).
   Solution:
   Begin by finding h. We have h = 3.2 - 3 = 0.2. Thus,
   Equation:

                                                                                                                                                        

           f (3.2) = f (3 + 0.2)  f (3) + (0.2)f (3) = 2 + 0.2 (5) = 3.

Hint
Use the same process as in the preceding example.

Motion along a Line

Another use for the derivative is to analyze motion along a line. We have
described velocity as the rate of change of position. If we take the
derivative of the velocity, we can find the acceleration, or the rate of change
of velocity. It is also important to introduce the idea of speed, which is the
magnitude of velocity. Thus, we can state the following mathematical
definitions.

Note:
Definition
Let s (t) be a function giving the position of an object at time t.
The velocity of the object at time t is given by v (t) = s (t).
The speed of the object at time t is given by |v (t)|.
The acceleration of the object at t is given by a (t) = v (t) = s (t).

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Comparing Instantaneous Velocity and Average Velocity

A ball is dropped from a height of 64 feet. Its height above ground (in

feet)  t  seconds  later  is  given  by  s  (t)  =                    2  +  64.

                                                    -16t

   a. What is the instantaneous velocity of the ball when it hits the
      ground?

   b. What is the average velocity during its fall?

Solution:

The first thing to do is determine how long it takes the ball to reach
the ground. To do this, set s (t) = 0. Solving -16t2 + 64 = 0, we
get t = 2, so it take 2 seconds for the ball to reach the ground.

   a. The instantaneous velocity of the ball as it strikes the ground is
      v (2). Since v (t) = s (t) = -32t, we obtain v (t) = -64 f t/s.

   b. The average velocity of the ball during its fall is
      Equation:

                            s (2) - s (0)           0 - 64

                  vave =                     =                  = -32 f t/s.

   Problem:
   Interpreting the Relationship between v (t) and a (t)

A particle moves along a coordinate axis in the positive direction to

the  right.  Its  position  at  time  t  is  given  by  s  (t)  =     3  -  4t  +  2.  Find

                                                                   t

v (1) and a (1) and use these values to answer the following

questions.

a. Is the particle moving from left to right or from right to left at
  time t = 1?

b. Is the particle speeding up or slowing down at time t = 1?

Solution:
Begin by finding v (t) and a (t).
and a (t) = v (t) = s (t) = 6t.
Evaluating these functions at t = 1, we obtain v (1) = -1 and

a (1) = 6.
a. Because v (1) < 0, the particle is moving from right to left.
b. Because v (1) < 0 and a (1) > 0, velocity and acceleration are

  acting in opposite directions. In other words, the particle is being
  accelerated in the direction opposite the direction in which it is
  traveling, causing |v (t)| to decrease. The particle is slowing
  down.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Position and Velocity

The position of a particle moving along a coordinate axis is given by

          3       2
s (t) = t - 9t + 24t + 4, t  0.

a. Find v (t).
b. At what time(s) is the particle at rest?
c. On what time intervals is the particle moving from left to right?

  From right to left?
d. Use the information obtained to sketch the path of the particle

  along a coordinate axis.

Solution:

a. The velocity is the derivative of the position function:
  Equation:

                                                2
                         v (t) = s (t) = 3t - 18t + 24.

b. The particle is at rest when v (t) = 0, so set

       2  -  18t  +  24  =  0.  Factoring  the  left-hand  side  of  the  equation

3t

produces 3 (t - 2) (t - 4) = 0. Solving, we find that the particle

is at rest at t = 2 and t = 4.
c. The particle is moving from left to right when v (t) > 0 and
  from right to left when v (t) < 0. [link] gives the analysis of the
  sign of v (t) for t  0, but it does not represent the axis along
  which the particle is moving.

      The sign of v(t) determines the direction of the particle.

  Since 3t2 - 18t + 24 > 0 on [0, 2)  (2, +), the particle is
  moving from left to right on these intervals.
  Since 3t2 - 18t + 24 < 0 on (2, 4), the particle is moving from
  right to left on this interval.
d. Before we can sketch the graph of the particle, we need to know
  its position at the time it starts moving (t = 0) and at the times
  that it changes direction (t = 2, 4). We have
  s (0) = 4, s (2) = 24, and s (4) = 20. This means that the
  particle begins on the coordinate axis at 4 and changes direction
  at 0 and 20 on the coordinate axis. The path of the particle is
  shown on a coordinate axis in [link].

            The path of the particle can be determined by
                              analyzing v(t).

   Solution:

   left to right
Hint

Find v (3) and look at the sign.

Population Change

In addition to analyzing velocity, speed, acceleration, and position, we can
use derivatives to analyze various types of populations, including those as
diverse as bacteria colonies and cities. We can use a current population,
together with a growth rate, to estimate the size of a population in the
future. The population growth rate is the rate of change of a population and
consequently can be represented by the derivative of the size of the
population.

Note:
Definition
If P (t) is the number of entities present in a population, then the
population growth rate of P (t) is defined to be P  (t).

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Estimating a Population

   The population of a city is tripling every 5 years. If its current
   population is 10,000, what will be its approximate population 2 years
   from now?

Solution:

Let P (t) be the population (in thousands) t years from now. Thus, we
know that P (0) = 10 and based on the information, we anticipate
P (5) = 30. Now estimate P  (0), the current growth rate, using
Equation:

        P (5) - P (0)     30 - 10

P (0)                  =                            = 4.

        5-0                                      5

By applying [link] to P (t), we can estimate the population 2 years
from now by writing
Equation:

                                                                                                                 

                         P (2)  P (0) + (2)P (0)  10 + 2 (4) = 18;

thus, in 2 years the population will be 18,000.

Note:

   Solution:

   3,300
Hint

Use P (3)  P (0) + 3P  (0).

Changes in Cost and Revenue

In addition to analyzing motion along a line and population growth,
derivatives are useful in analyzing changes in cost, revenue, and profit. The
concept of a marginal function is common in the fields of business and
economics and implies the use of derivatives. The marginal cost is the
derivative of the cost function. The marginal revenue is the derivative of the
revenue function. The marginal profit is the derivative of the profit
function, which is based on the cost function and the revenue function.

Note:
Definition
If C (x) is the cost of producing x items, then the marginal cost MC (x)
is M C (x) = C  (x).
If R (x) is the revenue obtained from selling x items, then the marginal
revenue M R (x) is M R (x) = R (x).
If P (x) = R (x) - C (x) is the profit obtained from selling x items, then
the marginal profit MP (x) is defined to be

M P (x) = P  (x) = M R (x) - M C (x) = R (x) - C  (x).

We can roughly approximate
Equation:
                                                                                  C (x + h) - C (x)

                                                                   

                    M C (x) = C (x) = lim

                                            h0       h

by choosing an appropriate value for h. Since x represents objects, a

reasonable and small value for h is 1. Thus, by substituting h = 1, we get

the approximation M C (x) = C  (x)  C (x + 1) - C (x). Consequently,

C  (x) for a given value of x can be thought of as the change in cost

associated with producing one additional item. In a similar way,

MR  (x)  =          (x)  approximates  the  revenue  obtained  by  selling                           one

            R

additional item, and MP (x) = P  (x) approximates the profit obtained by

producing and selling one additional item.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Applying Marginal Revenue

   Assume that the number of barbeque dinners that can be sold, x, can
   be related to the price charged, p, by the equation

     p (x) = 9 - 0.03x, 0  x  300.

   In this case, the revenue in dollars obtained by selling x barbeque
   dinners is given by
   Equation:

                                                                                                                                                               2

     R (x) = xp (x) = x (9 - 0.03x) = -0.03x + 9x f or 0  x  300.

   Use the marginal revenue function to estimate the revenue obtained
   from selling the 101st barbeque dinner. Compare this to the actual
   revenue obtained from the sale of this dinner.

   Solution:
   First, find the marginal revenue function:

                                                      

     M R (x) = R (x) = -0.06x + 9.

   Next, use R (100) to approximate R (101) - R (100), the revenue
   obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner. Since R (100) = 3, the
   revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is approximately
   $3.

   The actual revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is
   Equation:

                      R (101) - R (100) = 602.97 - 600 = 2.97, or $2.97.

   The marginal revenue is a fairly good estimate in this case and has the
   advantage of being easy to compute.

   dinner.

   Solution:

   $2
Hint

Use P  (100) to approximate P (101) - P (100).
Key Concepts

      Using f (a + h)  f (a) + f  (a)h, it is possible to estimate
      f (a + h) given f  (a) and f (a).
      The rate of change of position is velocity, and the rate of change of
      velocity is acceleration. Speed is the absolute value, or magnitude, of
      velocity.
      The population growth rate and the present population can be used to
      predict the size of a future population.
      Marginal cost, marginal revenue, and marginal profit functions can be
      used to predict, respectively, the cost of producing one more item, the
      revenue obtained by selling one more item, and the profit obtained by
      producing and selling one more item.

                                                            3

where t is measured in years.

The following problems deal with the Holling type I, II, and III equations.
These equations describe the ecological event of growth of a predator
population given the amount of prey available for consumption.
Exercise:
Problem:
[T] The Holling type I equation is described by f (x) = ax, where x
is the amount of prey available and a > 0 is the rate at which the
predator meets the prey for consumption.

   a. Graph the Holling type I equation, given a = 0.5.
   b. Determine the first derivative of the Holling type I equation and

      explain physically what the derivative implies.
   c. Determine the second derivative of the Holling type I equation

      and explain physically what the derivative implies.
   d. Using the interpretations from b. and c. explain why the Holling

      type I equation may not be realistic.

Solution:
a.

b. f  (x) = a. The more increase in prey, the more growth for
predators. c. f (x) = 0. As the amount of prey increases, the rate at
which the predator population growth increases is constant. d. This
equation assumes that if there is more prey, the predator is able to
increase consumption linearly. This assumption is unphysical because
   we would expect there to be some saturation point at which there is too
   much prey for the predator to consume adequately.

x is the amount of prey available and a > 0 is the maximum

consumption rate of the predator.

equations?

   [T] The Holling type III equation is described by f (x) = n2+x2 ax , 2
   where x is the amount of prey available and a > 0 is the maximum
   consumption rate of the predator.

         equations?

         interpret the physical meaning of the derivative.

      c. Find and interpret the meaning of the second derivative (it may
         help to graph the second derivative).
   d. What additional ecological phenomena does the Holling type III
      function describe compared with the Holling type II function?

Solution:
a.

b. f  (x) = 2 2 2 . 2axn2 When the amount of prey increases, the predator

growth increases. c. f (x) = 2 2 3 . When the amount of prey
           (n +x )

is extremely small, the rate at which predator growth is increasing is

increasing, but when the amount of prey reaches above a certain

threshold, the rate at which predator growth is increasing begins to

decrease. d. At lower levels of prey, the prey is more easily able to

avoid detection by the predator, so fewer prey individuals are

consumed, resulting in less predator growth.

Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions

      Find the derivatives of the sine and cosine function.
      Find the derivatives of the standard trigonometric functions.
      Calculate the higher-order derivatives of the sine and cosine.

One of the most important types of motion in physics is simple harmonic motion, which is associated with such
systems as an object with mass oscillating on a spring. Simple harmonic motion can be described by using either
sine or cosine functions. In this section we expand our knowledge of derivative formulas to include derivatives of
these and other trigonometric functions. We begin with the derivatives of the sine and cosine functions and then
use them to obtain formulas for the derivatives of the remaining four trigonometric functions. Being able to
calculate the derivatives of the sine and cosine functions will enable us to find the velocity and acceleration of
simple harmonic motion.

Derivatives of the Sine and Cosine Functions

We begin our exploration of the derivative for the sine function by using the formula to make a reasonable guess at
its derivative. Recall that for a function f(x),
Equation:

                                                         f (x + h) - f (x)

                                        f (x) = lim                         .

                                          h0             h

Consequently, for values of h very close to 0, f  (x)  h . f(x+h)-f(x) We see that by using h = 0.01,
Equation:

                                         d               sin (x + 0.01) - sin x
                                               (sin x)                        0.01

                                        dx

By setting D (x) =  sin (x+0.01)-sin x  and using a graphing utility, we can get a graph of an approximation to the

                    0.01

derivative of sin x ([link]).

The graph of the function D (x) looks a lot like
                   a cosine curve.
Upon inspection, the graph of D(x) appears to be very close to the graph of the cosine function. Indeed, we will
show that
Equation:

                                                                                                                 d
                                                                                                                        (sin x) = cos x.

                                                                                                                dx

If we were to follow the same steps to approximate the derivative of the cosine function, we would find that
Equation:

                                                                                                               d
                                                                                                                     (cos x) = -sin x.

                                                                                                             dx

Note:
The Derivatives of sin x and cos x
The derivative of the sine function is the cosine and the derivative of the cosine function is the negative sine.
Equation:

                                                             d
                                                                   (sin x) = cos x

                                                            dx

Equation:

                                                             d
                                                                   (cos x) = -sin x

                                                            dx

Because the proofs for     d (sin x) = cos x and             d  (cos x)  =  -sin x   use  similar  techniques,  we  provide  only  the

proof for   d  (sin x)  =  cos x.  Before  beginning,       recall  two  important   trigonometric  limits  we  learned  in
           dx

Introduction to Limits:

Equation:

                                                     sin h                  cosh h - 1
                                           lim
                                           h0 h             = 1 and lim                   = 0.

                                                                    h0      h

The graphs of y = (sinh) and y = (cosh-1) are shown in [link].
                        h                  h
      These graphs show two important limits needed to establish the derivative formulas for the
                                             sine and cosine functions.

We also recall the following trigonometric identity for the sine of the sum of two angles:
Equation:

                                                                                       sin (x + h) = sin x cos h + cos x sin h.

Now that we have gathered all the necessary equations and identities, we proceed with the proof.
Equation:

 d                                  sin (x+h)-sin x                                                  Apply the def inition of the derivative.

[link] shows the relationship between the graph of f (x) = sin x and its derivative f  (x) = cos x. Notice that at

the points where f (x) = sin x has a horizontal tangent, its derivative f  (x) = cos x takes on the value zero. We

also  see    that  where  f  (x)  =  sin x                   is  increasing,                 (x)  =  cos x  >  0  and  where  f  (x)  =  sin x  is  decreasing,

f (x) = cos x < 0.
Where f(x) has a maximum or a minimum, f(x) = 0
that is, f(x) = 0 where f(x) has a horizontal tangent.

   An Application to Velocity

   A particle moves along a coordinate axis in such a way that its position at time t is given by
   s (t) = 2 sin t - t for 0  t  2. At what times is the particle at rest?
Solution:

To    determine  when  the  particle  is  at  rest,  set        (t)  =   v  (t)  =  0.  Begin       by  finding         (t).  We  obtain

so we must solve

                                              2 cos t - 1 = 0 f or 0  t  2.

The solutions to this equation are t =               and t =         5   .  Thus  the   particle    is  at  rest  at  times   t  =     and t =  5

Now apply the quotient rule to obtain

To find the equation of the tangent line, we need a point and a slope at that point. To find the point, compute
Equation:

   Problem:
   Finding the Derivative of Trigonometric Functions

   Find the derivative of f (x) = csc x + x tan x.

Solution:

To find this derivative, we must use both the sum rule and the product rule. Using the sum rule, we find
Equation:

                                       d                     d
                                             (csc x) +             (x tan x).
                             f (x) =
                                      dx                    dx

In the first term, dx (csc x) = -csc x cot x, d and by applying the product rule to the second term we obtain
Equation:

                                                                                 d2
                                                                                       (x tan x) = (1)(tan x) + (sec x)(x).

                                                                               dx

A particle moves along a coordinate axis in such a way that its position at time t is given by
s (t) = 2 - sin t. Find v (/4) and a (/4). Compare these values and decide whether the particle is
speeding up or slowing down.

Solution:

First find v (t) = s (t):
Equation:

                                                                                                                                        

                                                                                                          v (t) = s (t) = -cos t.

Thus,

                                                                                                                                      1

Next, find a (t) = v(t). Thus, a (t) = v (t) = sin t and we have
Equation:

                                                                                                  1

Since v ( )  = - 1                 < 0 and a ( )  =                            1  > 0, we see that velocity and acceleration are acting in opposite

Key Concepts

We can find the derivatives of sin x and cos x by using the definition of derivative and the limit formulas
found earlier. The results are
Equation:

                                                   d                           sin x = cos x   d  cos x = -sin x.

differences, products, quotients, and constant multiples of these functions. However, these techniques do not

allow  us  to  differentiate        compositions          of  functions,        such      as  h  (x)  =                        3  or  k  (x)   =  3x2       +   1.  In  this

section, we study the rule for finding the derivative of the composition of two or more functions.

Deriving the Chain Rule

When we have a function that is a composition of two or more functions, we could use all of the techniques we
have already learned to differentiate it. However, using all of those techniques to break down a function into
simpler parts that we are able to differentiate can get cumbersome. Instead, we use the chain rule, which states
that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function
times the derivative of the inner function.

To  put  this  rule   into      context,    let's  take   a  look       at  an  example:      h  (x)    =   sin             3         We     can  think  of  the  derivative  of

                                                                                                                    (x ).

this function with respect to x as the rate of change of sin(x3) relative to the change in x. Consequently, we want

to know how sin(x3) changes as x changes. We can think of this event as a chain reaction: As x changes, x3

changes, which leads to a change in sin (x3). This chain reaction gives us hints as to what is involved in

computing the derivative of sin(x3). First of all, a change in x forcing a change in x3 suggests that somehow the

derivative of x3 is involved. In addition, the change in x3 forcing a change in sin(x3) suggests that the derivative

of  sin(u)   with     respect       to  u,  where    u  =        3  is  also    part  of  the    final  derivative.

                                                             x,

We  can  take   a     more      formal  look     at  the  derivative        of  h  (x)    =    sin          3  by   setting              up  the  limit  that   would   give  us

                                                                                                    (x )

the derivative at a specific value a in the domain of h (x) = sin (x3).

Equation:

                                                                                   sin (x3) - sin(a3)

                                                              

                                                             h (a) = lim                                            .

                                                                            xa                x-a

This expression does not seem particularly helpful; however, we can modify it by multiplying and dividing by the

expression         3  -      3  to  obtain

               x         a

Equation:

                                                                            sin (x3) - sin(a3) x3 - a3

                                                   h (a) = lim                                                                        .

                                                                    xa             x3 - a3                       x-a

From the definition of the derivative, we can see that the second factor is the derivative of x3 at x = a. That is,
Equation:

                                                                    x3 - a3               d      3               2

                                                              lim                  =             (x ) = 3a .

                                                              xa x - a                    dx

However, it might be a little more challenging to recognize that the first term is also a derivative. We can see this

by  letting  u  =         3  and    observing    that   as   x          a,  u          3

                      x                                                            a:
Equation:

                                                      sin (x3)-sin (a3)              sin u-sin (a3)
                                                                                               u-a3
                                              lim            x3-a3         =   lim

                                              xa                              ua3

                                                                                       d

                                                                           du = (sin u)u=a3
                                                                           = cos (a3 ).

Thus, h (a) = cos(a3)  3a2.

In other words, if h (x) = sin (x3), then h (x) = cos (x3)  3x2. Thus, if we think of h (x) = sin(x3) as the

composition (f  g) (x) = f (g (x)) where f (x) = sin x and g (x) = x3, then the derivative of h (x) = sin(x3)

is  the  product  of  the  derivative  of  g  (x)  =      3  and  the  derivative  of   the  function  f  (x)  =  sin x  evaluated  at  the

                                                      x

function g (x) = x3. At this point, we anticipate that for h (x) = sin (g (x)), it is quite likely that

h(x) = cos(g(x))g(x). As we determined above, this is the case for h (x) = sin (x ) 3 .

Now that we have derived a special case of the chain rule, we state the general case and then apply it in a general
form to other composite functions. An informal proof is provided at the end of the section.

Note:

is given by

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Applying the Chain Rule

   1. To differentiate h (x) = f (g (x)), begin by identifying f(x) and g(x).
   2. Find f(x) and evaluate it at g (x) to obtain f  (g (x)).
   3. Find g(x).
   4. Write h (x) = f  (g (x))  g (x).
Note: When applying the chain rule to the composition of two or more functions, keep in mind that we work our
way from the outside function in. It is also useful to remember that the derivative of the composition of two
functions can be thought of as having two parts; the derivative of the composition of three functions has three
parts; and so on. Also, remember that we never evaluate a derivative at a derivative.

The Chain and Power Rules Combined

We can now apply the chain rule to composite functions, but note that we often need to use it with other rules. For
example, to find derivatives of functions of the form h (x) = (g (x)) , n we need to use the chain rule combined
with the power rule. To do so, we can think of h (x) = (g (x))n as f (g (x)) where f (x) = xn. Then

f  (x) = nxn-1. Thus, f  (g (x)) = n(g (x)) . n-1 This leads us to the derivative of a power function using the
chain rule,
Equation:

                                                                            n-1 

                                               h (x) = n(g (x))             g (x)

Note:

Then

                                      (3x +1)

Solution:

First, rewrite h (x) =        1 2 -2

                             2 2 = (3x + 1) .
                        (3x +1)

Applying   the  power  rule  with  g  (x)  =            2  +  1,  we  have

   Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line

   Find the equation of a line tangent to the graph of h (x) = 2 1 at x = 2.

                                                                                                                                                                                                             (3x-5)

   Solution:

   Because we are finding an equation of a line, we need a point. The x-coordinate of the point is 2. To find the
   y-coordinate, substitute 2 into h(x). Since h (2) = 2 1 = 1, the point is (2, 1).

                                                                                                                                                                                    (3(2)-5)
For the slope, we need h(2). To find h(x), first we rewrite h (x) = (3x - 5)-2 and apply the power rule
to obtain
Equation:

                                                        -3                       -3

                                     h (x) = -2(3x - 5) (3) = -6(3x - 5) .

By substituting, we have h (2) = -6(3 (2) - 5) = -6. -3 Therefore, the line has equation
y - 1 = -6 (x - 2). Rewriting, the equation of the line is y = -6x + 13.

Combining the Chain Rule with Other Rules

Now that we can combine the chain rule and the power rule, we examine how to combine the chain rule with the
other rules we have learned. In particular, we can use it with the formulas for the derivatives of trigonometric
functions or with the product rule.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Using the Chain Rule on a General Cosine Function

   Find the derivative of h (x) = cos (g(x)).

Solution:

Think of h (x) = cos(g(x)) as f (g (x)) where f (x) = cos x. Since f  (x) = -sin x. we have

       (g  (x))  =  -sin  (g  (x)).  Then  we  do  the  following  calculation.

f

Equation:

                    h (x)     = f  (g (x))g (x)         Apply the chain rule.
                              = -sin (g (x))g (x)       Substitute f  (g (x)) = -sin (g (x)).

Thus, the derivative of h (x) = cos (g(x)) is given by h (x) = -sin (g (x))g (x).
In the following example we apply the rule that we have just derived.

                                                       h (x) = -sin (5x )  10x

                                                                                                                        2

   Problem:
   Using the Chain Rule on Another Trigonometric Function

   Find the derivative of h (x) = sec (4x5 + 2x).

Solution:

Apply the chain rule to h (x) = sec (g (x)) to obtain
Equation:

                                                                                                                           

                                                   h (x) = sec(g (x) tan (g (x))g (x).

In  this  problem,  g  (x)  =           5  +  2x,  so  we  have        (x)  =               4  +  2.                       Therefore,  we  obtain

   Solution:
             

     h (x) = 7 cos (7x + 2)

Hint
Apply the chain rule to h (x) = sin g (x) first and then use g (x) = 7x + 2.

At this point we provide a list of derivative formulas that may be obtained by applying the chain rule in
conjunction with the formulas for derivatives of trigonometric functions. Their derivations are similar to those
used in [link] and [link]. For convenience, formulas are also given in Leibniz's notation, which some students find
easier to remember. (We discuss the chain rule using Leibniz's notation at the end of this section.) It is not
absolutely necessary to memorize these as separate formulas as they are all applications of the chain rule to
previously learned formulas.

Hint

Start out by applying the quotient rule. Remember to use the chain rule to differentiate the denominator.

Composites of Three or More Functions

We can now combine the chain rule with other rules for differentiating functions, but when we are differentiating
the composition of three or more functions, we need to apply the chain rule more than once. If we look at this
situation in general terms, we can generate a formula, but we do not need to remember it, as we can simply apply
the chain rule multiple times.

In general terms, first we let
Equation:

                                                                                                           k (x) = h (f (g (x))).

Then, applying the chain rule once we obtain

Applying the chain rule again, we obtain
Equation:

Note:

For all values of x for which the function is differentiable, if
Equation:

                                                   k (x) = h (f (g (x))),

then
Equation:

In other words, we are applying the chain rule twice.
Notice that the derivative of the composition of three functions has three parts. (Similarly, the derivative of the
composition of four functions has four parts, and so on.) Also, remember, we can always work from the outside in,
taking one derivative at a time.

   Using the Chain Rule in a Velocity Problem
A particle moves along a coordinate axis. Its position at time t is given by s (t) = sin (2t) + cos (3t).

What is the velocity of the particle at time t =

Solution:

To find v(t), the velocity of the particle at time t, we must differentiate s (t). Thus,
Equation:

                                                           

                             v (t) = s (t) = 2 cos (2t) - 3 sin (3t).

Substituting t = 6  into v(t), we obtain v ( 6 ) = -2.

Hint

Acceleration is the second derivative of position.

Proof

At this point, we present a very informal proof of the chain rule. For simplicity's sake we ignore certain issues:
For example, we assume that g (x)  g(a) for x  a in some open interval containing a. We begin by applying
the limit definition of the derivative to the function h(x) to obtain h(a):
Equation:

                                                  f (g(x)) - f (g (a))

                             h (a) = lim                                .

                                        xa               x-a

Rewriting, we obtain
Equation:

                                        f (g (x)) - f (g (a)) g (x) - g (a)

                           h (a) = lim                                       .

                             xa         g (x) - g (a)                   x-a

Although it is clear that
Equation:

                                        g (x) - g (a)                 

                               lim                       = g (a),

                               xa                 x-a
it is not obvious that
Equation:

                                          f (g (x)) - f (g (a))                

                                     lim                         = f (g (a)).

                                     xa       g (x) - g (a)

To see that this is true, first recall that since g is differentiable at a, g is also continuous at a. Thus,
Equation:

                                                                                                                lim g (x) = g (a).

                                                                                                                                                              xa

Next, make the substitution y = g(x) and b = g(a) and use change of variables in the limit to obtain
Equation:

                             f (g (x)) - f (g (a))         f (y) - f (b)           

                        lim                         = lim                 = f (b) = f (g (a)).

                        xa     g (x) - g (a)        yb       y-b

Finally,
Equation:

                                     f (g (x)) - f (g (a)) g (x) - g (a)             

                        h (a) = lim                                       = f (g (a))g (a).

                               xa       g (x) - g (a)            x-a

The Chain Rule Using Leibniz's Notation

As with other derivatives that we have seen, we can express the chain rule using Leibniz's notation. This notation
for the chain rule is used heavily in physics applications.

For h (x) = f (g (x)), let u = g(x) and y = h (x) = g (u). Thus,
Equation:

                        dy                                    dy                           du
                               , f (g (x)) = f (u) =          du                                  .
               h (x) =                                                and g (x) =

Consequently,

                        = h (x) = f (g (x))g (x) =                           .

Key Concepts

The chain rule allows us to differentiate compositions of two or more functions. It states that for

h (x) = f (g (x)),

Equation:

                                                                                  
                                            h (x) = f (g (x))g (x).

In Leibniz's notation this rule takes the form
Equation:

                                                            dy         dy du

                                                                  =                 .

                                                            dx         du dx

We can use the chain rule with other rules that we have learned, and we can derive formulas for some of
them.
The chain rule combines with the power rule to form a new rule:
Equation:

                                                            n                                 n-1 

                                    If h (x) = (g (x)) , then h (x) = n(g (x))                      g (x).

When applied to the composition of three functions, the chain rule can be expressed as follows: If
h (x) = f (g (k (x))), then h (x) = f (g (k (x))g (k (x))k (x).

Derivatives of Inverse Functions

      Calculate the derivative of an inverse function.
      Recognize the derivatives of the standard inverse trigonometric functions.

In this section we explore the relationship between the derivative of a function
and the derivative of its inverse. For functions whose derivatives we already
know, we can use this relationship to find derivatives of inverses without having
to use the limit definition of the derivative. In particular, we will apply the
formula for derivatives of inverse functions to trigonometric functions. This
formula may also be used to extend the power rule to rational exponents.

The Derivative of an Inverse Function

We begin by considering a function and its inverse. If f(x) is both invertible
and differentiable, it seems reasonable that the inverse of f(x) is also
differentiable. [link] shows the relationship between a function f(x) and its
inverse f -1 (x). Look at the point (a, f -1 (a)) on the graph of f -1(x) having a
tangent line with a slope of (f ) -1 (a) = q .  p This point corresponds to a point
(f -1 (a), a) on the graph of f(x) having a tangent line with a slope of
f (  f -1 (a)) = p . q Thus, if f -1(x) is differentiable at a, then it must be the
case that
Equation:

         -1               1

(f ) (a) =                                  .
              f  (f -1 (a))
  The tangent lines of a function and its inverse are
related; so, too, are the derivatives of these functions.

We may also derive the formula for the derivative of the inverse by first
recalling that x = f (f -1 (x)). Then by differentiating both sides of this

equation (using the chain rule on the right), we obtain
Equation:

                                            -1  -1 

                                1 = f (f (x)) (f ) (x)).

Solving  for  (f  -1      (x),  we  obtain

                       )

Equation:

                                         -1                 1

                                (f ) (x) =                                    .
                                                f  (f -1 (x))

We summarize this result in the following theorem.
Note:
Inverse Function Theorem
Let f(x) be a function that is both invertible and differentiable. Let
y = f -1 (x) be the inverse of f(x). For all x satisfying f (  f -1 (x))  0,

Equation:

           dy                           d                    -1                              1
                    =                                                                                         .
                                                         -1
                                        (f (x)) = (f ) (x) =

Alternatively, if y = g (x) is the inverse of f (x), then
Equation:

                                        g (x) =                       1

                                                             f  (g (x))

From the previous example, we see that we can use the inverse function
theorem to extend the power rule to exponents of the form n , 1 where n is a

Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions

We now turn our attention to finding derivatives of inverse trigonometric
functions. These derivatives will prove invaluable in the study of integration
later in this text. The derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions are quite
surprising in that their derivatives are actually algebraic functions. Previously,
derivatives of algebraic functions have proven to be algebraic functions and
derivatives of trigonometric functions have been shown to be trigonometric
functions. Here, for the first time, we see that the derivative of a function need
not be of the same type as the original function.

To   see  that  cos                -1  =  1  -  x2,         consider  the   following   argument.   Set

                     (sin x)

sin-1x = . In this case, sin  = x where - 2    2 .   We begin by

considering the case where 0 <  <                           .  Since    is  an  acute   angle,  we  may
                                                2

construct a right triangle having acute angle , a hypotenuse of length 1 and the

side opposite angle  having length x. From the Pythagorean theorem, the side

adjacent to angle  has length 1 - x2. This triangle is shown in [link]. Using

the  triangle,  we     see  that  cos                   -1  =  cos    =  1      -  x2.

                                          (sin x)

    Using a right triangle having acute
    angle , a hypotenuse of length 1,

       and the side opposite angle 
     having length x, we can see that

    cos (sin-1x) = cos  = 1 - x2.
In  the  case   where  -             <  < 0, we make the observation that 0 < - <                                             
                                 2                                                                                            2

and hence

Equation:

                   cos (sin-1x) = cos  = cos (-) = 1 - x2.

Now if  = 2  or  = - 2 , x = 1  or x = -1, and since in either case
cos  = 0 and 1 - x2 = 0, we have
Equation:

                                                   cos (sin-1x) = cos  = 1 - x2.

Consequently,      in  all       cases,   cos                  -1  =   1   -                       x2.

Implicit Differentiation

      Find the derivative of a complicated function by using implicit differentiation.
      Use implicit differentiation to determine the equation of a tangent line.

We have already studied how to find equations of tangent lines to functions and the rate of change of a function at
a specific point. In all these cases we had the explicit equation for the function and differentiated these functions
explicitly. Suppose instead that we want to determine the equation of a tangent line to an arbitrary curve or the rate
of change of an arbitrary curve at a point. In this section, we solve these problems by finding the derivatives of
functions that define y implicitly in terms of x.

Implicit Differentiation

In most discussions of math, if the dependent variable y is a function of the independent variable x, we express y

in terms of x. If this is the case, we say that y is an explicit function of x. For example, when we write the

equation y = x2 + 1, we are defining y explicitly in terms of x. On the other hand, if the relationship between the

function y and the variable x is expressed by an equation where y is not expressed entirely in terms of x, we say

that  the  equation  defines  y  implicitly  in  terms  of  x.  For     example,  the  equation  y  -      2  =  1  defines  the  function

                                                                                                       x

y = x2 + 1 implicitly.

Implicit differentiation allows us to find slopes of tangents to curves that are clearly not functions (they fail the
vertical line test). We are using the idea that portions of y are functions that satisfy the given equation, but that y is
not actually a function of x.

In general, an equation defines a function implicitly if the function satisfies that equation. An equation may define
many different functions implicitly. For example, the functions

y = 25 - x2 and y = {            25 - x2 if - 25  x < 0              , which are illustrated in [link], are just three of the many

                                 -25 - x2 if 0  x  25

functions  defined   implicitly  by  the  equation      2  +      2  =  25.

                                                    x         y
                  The equation x2 + y2 = 25 defines many functions implicitly.

If  we  want  to  find  the  slope  of  the  line  tangent  to  the  graph  of      2  +      2  =  25  at  the  point  (3,  4),  we  could  evaluate

                                                                                x         y

the derivative of the function y = 25 - x2 at x = 3. On the other hand, if we want the slope of the tangent line

at the point (3, -4), we could use the derivative of y = -25 - x2. However, it is not always easy to solve for a

function defined implicitly by an equation. Fortunately, the technique of implicit differentiation allows us to find
the derivative of an implicitly defined function without ever solving for the function explicitly. The process of

                            dy

finding dx using implicit differentiation is described in the following problem-solving strategy.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Implicit Differentiation
To perform implicit differentiation on an equation that defines a function y implicitly in terms of a variable x, use
the following steps:
1. Take the derivative of both sides of the equation. Keep in mind that y is a function of x. Consequently,

whereas d (sin x) = cos x, d (sin y) = cos y dy because we must use the chain rule to differentiate sin y
           dx                                       dx                 dx

with respect to x.

                                                                         dy                                                  dy
2. Rewrite the equation so that all terms containing dx are on the left and all terms that do not contain dx are

on the right.

                                              dy

3. Factor out dx on the left.

                                          dy

4. Solve for dx by dividing both sides of the equation by an appropriate algebraic expression.

Analysis

                                                                                                                              dy

Note that the resulting expression for dx is in terms of both the independent variable x and the dependent

                                                                                                                                                                                                                         dy

Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

      Find the derivative of exponential functions.
      Find the derivative of logarithmic functions.
      Use logarithmic differentiation to determine the derivative of a function.

So far, we have learned how to differentiate a variety of functions, including trigonometric, inverse, and implicit
functions. In this section, we explore derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions. As we discussed in
Introduction to Functions and Graphs, exponential functions play an important role in modeling population growth
and the decay of radioactive materials. Logarithmic functions can help rescale large quantities and are particularly
helpful for rewriting complicated expressions.

Derivative of the Exponential Function

Just as when we found the derivatives of other functions, we can find the derivatives of exponential and
logarithmic functions using formulas. As we develop these formulas, we need to make certain basic assumptions.
The proofs that these assumptions hold are beyond the scope of this course.

First  of  all,  we  begin    with   the    assumption         that  the  function  B      (x)        =      x  b  >  0,  is  defined  for  every     real  number

                                                                                                          b,

and is continuous. In previous courses, the values of exponential functions for all rational numbers were defined--

Later,  we  defined        0            -n       1     for  a  positive   integer          and           s/t       t  s    for  positive   integers      and      These

                              b,                                          b         lim b

Approximating a Value of 4
We  also     assume       that  for  B       (x)  =     x   b  >        0,  the  value          (0)  of  the  derivative   exists.  In  this  section,      we  show    that

                                                     b,                                 B

by making this one additional assumption, it is possible to prove that the function B (x) is differentiable

everywhere.

We make one final assumption: that there is a unique value of b > 0 for which B (0) = 1. We define e to be this

unique value, as we did in Introduction to Functions and Graphs. [link] provides graphs of the functions

y  =      x  y  =      x  y  =            x  and  y  =               x  A   visual  estimate    of   the    slopes  of  the   tangent   lines  to  these    functions   at   0

      2,           3,           2.7 ,                      2.8 .

provides     evidence        that  the       value   of  e  lies        somewhere   between          2.7    and  2.8.  The    function  E  (x)     =     x  is  called  the

                                                                                                                                                      e

natural exponential function. Its inverse, L (x) = logex = ln x is called the natural logarithmic function.

                          The graph of E (x) = ex is between y = 2x and y = 3x.

For a better estimate of e, we may construct a table of estimates of B (0) for functions of the form B (x) = bx.
Before doing this, recall that
Equation:

                                                                                 x      0                x              x
                                                                                 b -b                    b -1          b -1
                                                         

                                                     B (0) = lim                           = lim                 

                                                                        x0 x - 0                x0          x              x

estimate

Estimating a Value of e

The evidence from the table suggests that 2.7182 < e < 2.7183.

The  graph  of  E  (x)  =       x  together  with         the  line  y  =  x   +   1  are  shown  in  [link].              This  line  is  tangent  to  the    graph  of

                             e

E (x) = ex at x = 0.

     The  tangent  line  to  E     (x)  =       x  at  x  =    0  has   slope  1.

                                             e

Now that we have laid out our basic assumptions, we begin our investigation by exploring the derivative of
B (x) = bx, b > 0. Recall that we have assumed that B (0) exists. By applying the limit definition to the
derivative we conclude that

everywhere, but its derivative is

For E (x) = ex, E (0) = 1. Thus, we have E (x) = ex. (The value of B (0) for an arbitrary function of the form

Derivative of the Logarithmic Function

Now that we have the derivative of the natural exponential function, we can use implicit differentiation to find the
derivative of its inverse, the natural logarithmic function.

If x > 0 and y = ln x, then
Equation:

                                                                                  dy        1

                                                                                        =      .

                                                                                  dx        x

More generally, let g (x) be a differentiable function. For all values of x for which g (x) > 0, the derivative of
h (x) = ln (g (x)) is given by
Equation:

                                                                                          1

                                                                                                   g (x).

Proof

If  x  >   0  and  y  =  ln x,                then     y  =  x.  Differentiating  both  sides  of     this     equation  results  in  the  equation

                                                    e

Equation:

                                                                                        dy  = 1.

                                                                                     y

                                                                                  e
                                                                                        dx

                                         dy

Solving for dx yields
Equation:

                                                dy       1

                                                      =     .

                                                dx ey

Finally, we substitute x = ey to obtain
Equation:

                                                dy       1

                                                      =     .

                                                dx       x

We may also derive this result by applying the inverse function theorem, as follows. Since y = g(x) = ln x is the
inverse of f (x) = ex, by applying the inverse function theorem we have
Equation:

                                         dy     1              1               1

                                             =           =        =               .

                                         dx f  (g (x)) eln x x

Using this result and applying the chain rule to h (x) = ln (g (x)) yields
Equation:

                                                          1

                                             h (x) =                         

                                                                   g (x).

                                                                     dy              x
                                                                     dx
                                                                         = b ln b.

         More generally, if h (x) = bg(x), then
         Equation:

                                                                         g(x)

                                                             h (x) = b            g (x) ln b.

Proof

If y = logbx, then by = x. It follows that ln (by) = ln x. Thus y ln b = ln x. Solving for y, we have y = lnb lnx .
Differentiating and keeping in mind that ln b is a constant, we see that
Equation:

                                                                 dy            1

                                                                     =               .

                                                                 dx      x ln b

The derivative in [link] now follows from the chain rule.

If  y  =     x  then     ln  y  =  x ln b.  Using  implicit  differentiation,  again    keeping             in  mind  that  ln b  is  constant,  it  follows

          b,

that y dx 1 = ln b. dy Solving for dx dy and substituting y = bx, we see that

Equation:

                                                             dy                                          x

The more general derivative ([link]) follows from the chain rule.

Logarithmic Differentiation

At this point, we can take derivatives of functions of the form y = (g (x))n for certain values of n, as well as

functions  of  the  form  y  =  bg(x) ,  where               b  >   0  and  b    1.  Unfortunately,  we  still  do  not  know  the  derivatives  of

functions such as y = xx or y = x. These functions require a technique called logarithmic differentiation,

which allows us to differentiate any function of the form h (x) = g(x) . f(x) It can also be used to convert a very

complex differentiation problem into a simpler one, such as finding the derivative of y =                                x2x+1
                                                                                                                          x 3 . We outline this

technique in the following problem-solving strategy.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Using Logarithmic Differentiation

1. To differentiate y = h (x) using logarithmic differentiation, take the natural logarithm of both sides of the

equation to obtain ln y = ln (h (x)).

2. Use properties of logarithms to expand ln (h (x)) as much as possible.

3. Differentiate both sides of the equation. On the left we will have y dx . 1 dy

4. Multiply both sides of the equation by y to solve for                              dy

Key Concepts

  On the basis of the assumption that the exponential function y = bx, b > 0 is continuous everywhere and

  differentiable at 0, this function is differentiable everywhere and there is a formula for its derivative.

  We can use a formula to find the derivative of y = ln x, and the relationship logbx =  ln x  allows us to extend
                                                                                         ln b

  our differentiation formulas to include logarithms with arbitrary bases.

  Logarithmic differentiation allows us to differentiate functions of the form y = g(x)f(x) or very complex

  functions by taking the natural logarithm of both sides and exploiting the properties of logarithms before

  differentiating.

A rocket is being launched from the ground and cameras are recording the
event. A video camera is located on the ground a certain distance from the
launch pad. At what rate should the angle of inclination (the angle the
camera makes with the ground) change to allow the camera to record the
flight of the rocket as it heads upward? (See [link].)

A rocket launch involves two related quantities that change over time.
Being able to solve this type of problem is just one application of
derivatives introduced in this chapter. We also look at how derivatives are
used to find maximum and minimum values of functions. As a result, we
will be able to solve applied optimization problems, such as maximizing
revenue and minimizing surface area. In addition, we examine how
derivatives are used to evaluate complicated limits, to approximate roots of
functions, and to provide accurate graphs of functions.
Related Rates

      Express changing quantities in terms of derivatives.
      Find relationships among the derivatives in a given problem.
      Use the chain rule to find the rate of change of one quantity that
      depends on the rate of change of other quantities.

We have seen that for quantities that are changing over time, the rates at
which these quantities change are given by derivatives. If two related
quantities are changing over time, the rates at which the quantities change
are related. For example, if a balloon is being filled with air, both the radius
of the balloon and the volume of the balloon are increasing. In this section,
we consider several problems in which two or more related quantities are
changing and we study how to determine the relationship between the rates
of change of these quantities.

Setting up Related-Rates Problems

In many real-world applications, related quantities are changing with

respect to time. For example, if we consider the balloon example again, we

can say that the rate of change in the volume, V , is related to the rate of

change in the radius, r. In this case, we say that     dV   and    dr  are related
                                                        dt         dt

rates because V is related to r. Here we study several examples of related

quantities that are changing with respect to time and we look at how to

calculate one rate of change given another rate of change.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Inflating a Balloon

A spherical balloon is being filled with air at the constant rate of

2            3  ([link]).  How  fast  is  the  radius  increasing  when  the  radius

   cm /sec

is 3 cm?
As the balloon is being filled with air, both the radius and the
          volume are increasing with respect to time.

Solution:

The volume of a sphere of radius r centimeters is
Equation:

                                                                             433
                                                              V = r cm .

                                                                             3

Since the balloon is being filled with air, both the volume and the
radius are functions of time. Therefore, t seconds after beginning to
fill the balloon with air, the volume of air in the balloon is
Equation:

         4  3  3

V (t) =     [r(t)] cm .

         3

Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time and
applying the chain rule, we see that the rate of change in the volume is
related to the rate of change in the radius by the equation
Equation:

                                                                                                                                      2

                                                     V (t) = 4[r (t)] r (t).
The balloon is being filled with air at the constant rate of 2 cm3/sec,
so V (t) = 2 cm3/sec. Therefore,
Equation:

               3           2  2

           2cm /sec = (4[r(t)] cm )  (r(t)cm/s),

which implies
Equation:

                  r(t) =            1

                                                   cm/sec.

                                                       2

                           2[r (t)]

When the radius r = 3 cm,
Equation:

                  r(t) =      1
                                      cm/sec.

Hint

Before looking at other examples, let's outline the problem-solving strategy
we will be using to solve related-rates problems.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving a Related-Rates Problem

   1. Assign symbols to all variables involved in the problem. Draw a
      figure if applicable.

   2. State, in terms of the variables, the information that is given and the
      rate to be determined.

   3. Find an equation relating the variables introduced in step 1.
   4. Using the chain rule, differentiate both sides of the equation found in

      step 3 with respect to the independent variable. This new equation
      will relate the derivatives.
   5. Substitute all known values into the equation from step 4, then solve
      for the unknown rate of change.

Note that when solving a related-rates problem, it is crucial not to substitute
known values too soon. For example, if the value for a changing quantity is
substituted into an equation before both sides of the equation are
differentiated, then that quantity will behave as a constant and its derivative
will not appear in the new equation found in step 4. We examine this
potential error in the following example.

Examples of the Process

Let's now implement the strategy just described to solve several related-
rates problems. The first example involves a plane flying overhead. The
relationship we are studying is between the speed of the plane and the rate
at which the distance between the plane and a person on the ground is
changing.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   An Airplane Flying at a Constant Elevation
   An airplane is flying overhead at a constant elevation of 4000 ft. A
   man is viewing the plane from a position 3000 ft from the base of a
   radio tower. The airplane is flying horizontally away from the man. If
   the plane is flying at the rate of 600 ft/sec, at what rate is the
   distance between the man and the plane increasing when the plane
   passes over the radio tower?
   Solution:
   Step 1. Draw a picture, introducing variables to represent the different
   quantities involved.

      An airplane is flying at a constant height of 4000 ft. The distance
between the person and the airplane and the person and the place
   on the ground directly below the airplane are changing. We

denote those quantities with the variables s and x, respectively.

As shown, x denotes the distance between the man and the position
on the ground directly below the airplane. The variable s denotes the
distance between the man and the plane. Note that both x and s are
functions of time. We do not introduce a variable for the height of the
plane because it remains at a constant elevation of 4000 ft. Since an
object's height above the ground is measured as the shortest distance
between the object and the ground, the line segment of length 4000 ft
is perpendicular to the line segment of length x feet, creating a right
triangle.

Step 2. Since x denotes the horizontal distance between the man and

the point on the ground below the plane, dx/dt represents the speed

of the plane. We are told the speed of the plane is 600 ft/sec.

Therefore,  dx  = 600 ft/sec. Since we are asked to find the rate of
            dt

change in the distance between the man and the plane when the plane

is directly above the radio tower, we need to find ds/dt when

x = 3000 f t.

Step 3. From the figure, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to write
an equation relating x and s:
Equation:

                2        2          2

                [x (t)] + 4000 = [s (t)] .

Step 4. Differentiating this equation with respect to time and using the
fact that the derivative of a constant is zero, we arrive at the equation
Equation:

                    dx       ds
                x
                         =s      .
                     dt
                             dt
Step 5. Find the rate at which the distance between the man and the

plane is increasing when the plane is directly over the radio tower.

That is, find dt ds when x = 3000 ft. Since the speed of the plane is

600 ft/sec, we know that dt = 600 ft/sec. dx We are not given an

explicit value for s; however, since we are trying to find  ds  when
                                                            dt

x = 3000 ft, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the

distance s when x = 3000 and the height is 4000 ft. Solving the

equation

Equation:

                      2          2  2

                   3000 + 4000 = s

for s, we have s = 5000 ft at the time of interest. Using these values,
we conclude that ds/dt is a solution of the equation
Equation:

            (3000)(600) = (5000)       ds
                                              .

                                       dt

Therefore,
Equation:

            ds     3000  600

                =                = 360 f t/sec.

            dt     5000

Note: When solving related-rates problems, it is important not to
substitute values for the variables too soon. For example, in step 3, we
related the variable quantities x (t) and s (t) by the equation
Equation:

                   2          2        2

                [x (t)] + 4000 = [s (t)] .

Since the plane remains at a constant height, it is not necessary to
introduce a variable for the height, and we are allowed to use the
constant 4000 to denote that quantity. However, the other two
quantities are changing. If we mistakenly substituted x(t) = 3000
into the equation before differentiating, our equation would have been
Equation:

2  2                 2

3000 + 4000 = [s (t)] .

After differentiating, our equation would become
Equation:

              ds

   0 = s (t)      .

              dt

As a result, we would incorrectly conclude that  ds  = 0.

We now return to the problem involving the rocket launch from the
beginning of the chapter.

   Problem:
   Chapter Opener: A Rocket Launch

        (credit: modification of work by
          Steve Jurvetson, Wikimedia
                    Commons)

   A rocket is launched so that it rises vertically. A camera is positioned
   5000 ft from the launch pad. When the rocket is 1000 ft above the
   launch pad, its velocity is 600 ft/sec. Find the necessary rate of
   change of the camera's angle as a function of time so that it stays
   focused on the rocket.
   Solution:
   Step 1. Draw a picture introducing the variables.
A camera is positioned 5000 ft from the launch pad of the rocket.
     The height of the rocket and the angle of the camera are

 changing with respect to time. We denote those quantities with
                  the variables h and , respectively.

Let h denote the height of the rocket above the launch pad and  be
the angle between the camera lens and the ground.

Step 2. We are trying to find the rate of change in the angle of the

camera with respect to time when the rocket is 1000 ft off the ground.

That is, we need to find  d   when h = 1000 ft. At that time, we know
                          dt

the velocity of the rocket is dt dh = 600 ft/sec.

Step 3. Now we need to find an equation relating the two quantities
that are changing with respect to time: h and . How can we create
such an equation? Using the fact that we have drawn a right triangle,
it is natural to think about trigonometric functions. Recall that tan  is
the ratio of the length of the opposite side of the triangle to the length
of the adjacent side. Thus, we have
Equation:

                 tan  =      h
                                      .

                         5000

This gives us the equation
Equation:

                                                               h = 5000 tan .

Step 4. Differentiating this equation with respect to time t, we obtain
Equation:

             dh          2    d
             dt
                 = 5000 sec                                                    .

                              dt

Step 5. We want to find dt d when h = 1000 ft. At this time, we know
that dt dh = 600 ft/sec. We need to determine sec2. Recall that sec 
is the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the
adjacent side. We know the length of the adjacent side is 5000 ft. To
determine the length of the hypotenuse, we use the Pythagorean
theorem, where the length of one leg is 5000 ft, the length of the
other leg is h = 1000 ft, and the length of the hypotenuse is c feet as
shown in the following figure.

We see that
Equation:
                          2        2                                          2
                      1000 + 5000 = c

and we conclude that the hypotenuse is
Equation:

                                                             c = 100026 f t.

Therefore, when h = 1000, we have
Equation:

                                       2

                   2       100026                                                      26
                                                                                              .
               sec  = (               )=
                                                                                       25
                             5000

Recall from step 4 that the equation relating                                 d        to our known values
                                                                              dt

is

Equation:

                      dh           2 d
                      dt
                          = 5000 sec                                             .

                                       dt

When h = 1000 f t, we know that dh = 600 f t/sec and sec2 = 26 .
                             dt                                                                  25

Substituting these values into the previous equation, we arrive at the

equation

Equation:

                                   26 d

                   600 = 5000 (       )                                             .

                                   25 dt

Therefore, d = 3 rad/sec.

        water are changing over time. We denote these
      quantities with the variables h and r, respectively.
Let h denote the height of the water in the funnel, r denote the radius
of the water at its surface, and V denote the volume of the water.
Step 2: We need to determine dt dh when h = 2 ft. 1 We know that

 dV

         = -0.03 f t/sec.

  dt

Step 3: The volume of water in the cone is
Equation:
                                                   12
                                     V = r h.

                                                   3

From the figure, we see that we have similar triangles. Therefore, the

ratio of the sides in the two triangles is the same. Therefore,                  r  =  1
                                                                                 h     2

or r =  h  .  Using  this  fact,  the  equation        for    volume    can  be  simplified

to

Equation:

                                             2

                                  1    h                      3
                                                                    h.
                     V = ( ) h =

                                  3    2                      12

Step 4: Applying the chain rule while differentiating both sides of this
equation with respect to time t, we obtain
Equation:

                                  dV       2 dh
                                   dt
                                       =     h                .

                                          4            dt

Step 5: We want to find    dh     when h =             1   ft. Since water is leaving at
                           dt                          2

the rate of 0.03 ft /sec, 3 we know that               dV                    3

                                                       dt     = -0.03 f t /sec.

Therefore,
Equation:

                                                           2

                                          1                   dh

                           -0.03 =        ()                        ,

                                          42                  dt

which implies
Equation:

                                                          dh
                           -0.03 =                               .

                                                   16     dt
It follows that
Equation:

                 dh              0.48  = -0.153 f t/sec.
                 dt  =-

      Write the linearization of a given function.
      Draw a graph that illustrates the use of differentials to approximate the change in a quantity.
      Calculate the relative error and percentage error in using a differential approximation.

We have just seen how derivatives allow us to compare related quantities that are changing over time. In this
section, we examine another application of derivatives: the ability to approximate functions locally by linear
functions. Linear functions are the easiest functions with which to work, so they provide a useful tool for
approximating function values. In addition, the ideas presented in this section are generalized later in the text when
we study how to approximate functions by higher-degree polynomials Introduction to Power Series and Functions.

Linear Approximation of a Function at a Point

Consider a function f that is differentiable at a point x = a. Recall that the tangent line to the graph of f at a is
given by the equation
Equation:

                                                                                                      y = f (a) + f (a)(x - a).

For example, consider the function f(x) =         1     at    a  =   2.  Since  f   is  differentiable   at  x  =   2  and  f (x)  =  -  1     ,  we
                                                  x
                                                                                                                                            2
                                                                                                                                         x

see  that  f (2)  =  -  1  .  Therefore,  the  tangent  line  to  the  graph    of  f   at  a  =  2  is  given  by  the  equation
                        4

Equation:

                                                                  1      1

[link](a) shows a graph of f(x) =         1    along with the tangent line to f at x = 2. Note that for x near 2, the graph of
                                          x

the tangent line is close to the graph of f. As a result, we can use the equation of the tangent line to approximate

f(x) for x near 2. For example, if x = 2.1, the y value of the corresponding point on the tangent line is

Equation:

                                                        1         1

                                               y=           - (2.1 - 2) = 0.475.

                                                        2         4

The actual value of f(2.1) is given by
Equation:

                                                  f (2.1) =            1     0.47619.
                                                                     2.1

Therefore, the tangent line gives us a fairly good approximation of f(2.1) ([link](b)). However, note that for
values of x far from 2, the equation of the tangent line does not give us a good approximation. For example, if
x = 10, the y-value of the corresponding point on the tangent line is
Equation:

                                               1        1                       1

                                          y=      - (10 - 2) =                      - 2 = -1.5,

                                               2        4                       2

whereas the value of the function at x = 10 is f(10) = 0.1.
(a) The tangent line to f(x) = 1/x at x = 2 provides a good approximation to f for x near 2. (b) At
  x = 2.1, the value of y on the tangent line to f(x) = 1/x is 0.475. The actual value of f(2.1) is
                                    1/2.1, which is approximately 0.47619.

In general, for a differentiable function f, the equation of the tangent line to f at x = a can be used to
approximate f(x) for x near a. Therefore, we can write
Equation:

                                                                                   f (x)  f (a) + f (a)(x - a) f or x near a.

We call the linear function
Equation:

                             L(x) = f (a) + f (a)(x - a)

the linear approximation, or tangent line approximation, of f at x = a. This function L is also known as the
linearization of f at x = a.

To show how useful the linear approximation can be, we look at how to find the linear approximation for
f (x) = x at x = 9.

   Problem:
   Linear Approximation of x

   Find the linear approximation of f(x) = x at x = 9 and use the approximation to estimate 9.1.

   Solution:
Since we are looking for the linear approximation at x = 9, using [link] we know the linear approximation is
given by
Equation:

                                                                                           L(x) = f (9) + f (9)(x - 9).

We need to find f(9) and f(9).
Equation:

                                f (x) = x                f (9) = 9 = 3
                                                
                                f (x) =      1           f (9) =  1   =  1
                                         2x
                                                                  29     6

Therefore, the linear approximation is given by [link].
Equation:

                                L(x) = 3 +               1
                                                             (x - 9)

                                                         6

Using the linear approximation, we can estimate 9.1 by writing
Equation:

9.1 = f (9.1)  L(9.1) = 3 +                              1
                                                             (9.1 - 9)  3.0167.

                                                         6

      The local linear approximation to f(x) = x at x = 9
            provides an approximation to f for x near 9.

Analysis

Using a calculator, the value of 9.1 to four decimal places is 3.0166. The value given by the linear
approximation, 3.0167, is very close to the value obtained with a calculator, so it appears that using this linear
approximation is a good way to estimate x, at least for x near 9. At the same time, it may seem odd to use a
linear approximation when we can just push a few buttons on a calculator to evaluate 9.1. However, how does
the calculator evaluate 9.1? The calculator uses an approximation! In fact, calculators and computers use
approximations all the time to evaluate mathematical expressions; they just use higher-degree approximations.

To estimate sin(62°) using L, we must first convert 62° to radians. We have 62° =                                         62    radians, so the

f (x) = 4(1 + x)

Differentials

We have seen that linear approximations can be used to estimate function values. They can also be used to estimate
the amount a function value changes as a result of a small change in the input. To discuss this more formally, we
define a related concept: differentials. Differentials provide us with a way of estimating the amount a function
changes as a result of a small change in input values.

When we first looked at derivatives, we used the Leibniz notation dy/dx to represent the derivative of y with
respect to x. Although we used the expressions dy and dx in this notation, they did not have meaning on their own.
Here we see a meaning to the expressions dy and dx. Suppose y = f(x) is a differentiable function. Let dx be an
independent variable that can be assigned any nonzero real number, and define the dependent variable dy by
Equation:

                                                                                                                    dy = f (x)dx.

It is important to notice that dy is a function of both x and dx. The expressions dy and dx are called differentials.
We can divide both sides of [link] by dx, which yields

   Computing differentials

   For each of the following functions, find dy and evaluate when x = 3 and dx = 0.1.

      a. y = x2 + 2x
      b. y = cos x

Solution:
The key step is calculating the derivative. When we have that, we can obtain dy directly.

   a. Since f(x) = x2 + 2x, we know f(x) = 2x + 2, and therefore
      Equation:

                                                                                                               dy = (2x + 2)dx.

When x = 3 and dx = 0.1,
Equation:

                                                               dy = (2  3 + 2)(0.1) = 0.8.
b. Since f(x) = cos x, f(x) = -sin(x). This gives us
  Equation:

                                                                                                           dy = -sin x dx.

When x = 3 and dx = 0.1,
Equation:

                                                                  dy = -sin(3)(0.1) = -0.1 sin(3).

     dy = 2xex dx

Hint

dy = f (x)dx

We now connect differentials to linear approximations. Differentials can be used to estimate the change in the
value of a function resulting from a small change in input values. Consider a function f that is differentiable at
point a. Suppose the input x changes by a small amount. We are interested in how much the output y changes. If x
changes from a to a + dx, then the change in x is dx (also denoted x), and the change in y is given by
Equation:

                                                                                                       y = f (a + dx) - f (a).

Instead of calculating the exact change in y, however, it is often easier to approximate the change in y by using a
linear approximation. For x near a, f(x) can be approximated by the linear approximation
Equation:

                                                                                                  L(x) = f (a) + f (a)(x - a).

Therefore, if dx is small,
Equation:

                            f (a + dx)  L(a + dx) = f (a) + f (a)(a + dx - a).

That is,
Equation:

                            f (a + dx) - f (a)  L(a + dx) - f (a) = f (a)dx.
In other words, the actual change in the function f if x increases from a to a + dx is approximately the difference
between L(a + dx) and f(a), where L(x) is the linear approximation of f at a. By definition of L(x), this
difference is equal to f(a)dx. In summary,
Equation:

                                                        y = f (a + dx) - f (a)  L(a + dx) - f (a) = f (a)dx = dy.

Therefore, we can use the differential dy = f(a)dx to approximate the change in y if x increases from x = a to
x = a + dx. We can see this in the following graph.

The differential dy = f(a)dx is used to approximate the actual change in
                        y if x increases from a to a + dx.

We now take a look at how to use differentials to approximate the change in the value of the function that results
from a small change in the value of the input. Note the calculation with differentials is much simpler than
calculating actual values of functions and the result is very close to what we would obtain with the more exact
calculation.

   Problem:
   Approximating Change with Differentials

Let y = x2 + 2x. Compute y and dy at x = 3 if dx = 0.1.

Solution:

The actual change in y if x changes from x = 3 to x = 3.1 is given by
Equation:

                                            2            2

           y = f (3.1) - f (3) = [(3.1) + 2(3.1)] - [3 + 2(3)] = 0.81.

The approximate change in y is given by dy = f(3)dx. Since f(x) = 2x + 2, we have
Equation:
                                                                                     dy = f (3)dx = (2(3) + 2)(0.1) = 0.8.

Note:

Calculating the Amount of Error

Any type of measurement is prone to a certain amount of error. In many applications, certain quantities are
calculated based on measurements. For example, the area of a circle is calculated by measuring the radius of the
circle. An error in the measurement of the radius leads to an error in the computed value of the area. Here we
examine this type of error and study how differentials can be used to estimate the error.
Consider a function f with an input that is a measured quantity. Suppose the exact value of the measured quantity
is a, but the measured value is a + dx. We say the measurement error is dx (or x). As a result, an error occurs in
the calculated quantity f(x). This type of error is known as a propagated error and is given by
Equation:

                                                                                                       y = f (a + dx) - f (a).

Since all measurements are prone to some degree of error, we do not know the exact value of a measured quantity,
so we cannot calculate the propagated error exactly. However, given an estimate of the accuracy of a measurement,
we can use differentials to approximate the propagated error y. Specifically, if f is a differentiable function at a,
the propagated error is
Equation:

                                                                                                            y  dy = f (a)dx.

Unfortunately, we do not know the exact value a. However, we can use the measured value a + dx, and estimate
Equation:

                                                                                                     y  dy  f (a + dx)dx.

In the next example, we look at how differentials can be used to estimate the error in calculating the volume of a
box if we assume the measurement of the side length is made with a certain amount of accuracy.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
Volume of a Cube

Suppose the side length of a cube is measured to be 5 cm with an accuracy of 0.1 cm.

   a. Use differentials to estimate the error in the computed volume of the cube.
   b. Compute the volume of the cube if the side length is (i) 4.9 cm and (ii) 5.1 cm to compare the estimated

      error with the actual potential error.

Solution:

   a. The measurement of the side length is accurate to within ±0.1 cm. Therefore,
      Equation:

                                                                                                               -0.1  dx  0.1.

The volume of a cube is given by V = x3, which leads to
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                    2

                                                                                                         dV = 3x dx.

Using the measured side length of 5 cm, we can estimate that
Equation:

                                          2                                                                                                                                            2

                                -3(5) (0.1)  dV  3(5) (0.1).

Therefore,
Equation:

                                                                                                        -7.5  dV  7.5.

b. If the side length is actually 4.9 cm, then the volume of the cube is
  Equation:

                                                         3                                                                                                                                   3

                                V (4.9) = (4.9) = 117.649 cm .

If the side length is actually 5.1 cm, then the volume of the cube is
Equation:

                                                         3                                                                                                                                   3

                                V (5.1) = (5.1) = 132.651 cm .

Therefore, the actual volume of the cube is between 117.649 and 132.651. Since the side length is

measured   to  be  5  cm,  the  computed  volume  is  V  (5)  =      3  =                                                                                                              125.  Therefore,  the  error  in  the  computed

                                                                 5

volume is

Equation:

                                117.649 - 125  V  132.651 - 125.

That is,
Equation:

                                          -7.351  V  7.651.
We see the estimated error dV is relatively close to the actual potential error in the computed volume.

Hint

                               2

dV = 3x dx

The measurement error dx (=x) and the propagated error y are absolute errors. We are typically interested in

the size of an error relative to the size of the quantity being measured or calculated. Given an absolute error q for

                                                                                                                                                                                q

a particular quantity, we define the relative error as q , where q is the actual value of the quantity. The

percentage error is the relative error expressed as a percentage. For example, if we measure the height of a ladder

to be 63 in. when the actual height is 62 in., the absolute error is 1 in. but the relative error is              1  = 0.016, or
                                                                                                                 62

1.6%. By comparison, if we measure the width of a piece of cardboard to be 8.25 in. when the actual width is 8 in.,

our absolute error is  1  in., whereas the relative error is  0.25  =   1         ,  or  3.1%.  Therefore,  the  percentage  error                                                 in  the
                       4                                         8     32

measurement of the cardboard is larger, even though 0.25 in. is less than 1 in.

   Relative and Percentage Error

   An astronaut using a camera measures the radius of Earth as 4000 mi with an error of ±80 mi. Let's use
   differentials to estimate the relative and percentage error of using this radius measurement to calculate the
   volume of Earth, assuming the planet is a perfect sphere.

   Solution:

   If the measurement of the radius is accurate to within ±80, we have
   Equation:

                                                                                                                 -80  dr  80.

Since the volume of a sphere is given by V  = ( ) 4 r3, we have
                                                          3

Equation:

                                            dV = 4r dr.
Using the measured radius of 4000 mi, we can estimate

                     -4(4000) (80)  dV  4(4000) (80).

To estimate the relative error, consider  dV  . Since we do not know the exact value of the volume V , use the

measured radius r = 4000 mi to estimate V . We obtain V  ( 3 ) 4 (4000) . 3 Therefore the relative error

satisfies

Key Concepts

      A differentiable function y = f(x) can be approximated at a by the linear function
      Equation:

                                                                                                        L(x) = f (a) + f (a)(x - a).

      For a function y = f(x), if x changes from a to a + dx, then
      Equation:

                                                                                                                           dy = f (x)dx

      is an approximation for the change in y. The actual change in y is
      Equation:
                                                                                                             y = f (a + dx) - f (a).

      A measurement error dx can lead to an error in a calculated quantity f(x). The error in the calculated
      quantity is known as the propagated error. The propagated error can be estimated by

      Explain how to find the critical points of a function over a closed
      interval.
      Describe how to use critical points to locate absolute extrema over a
      closed interval.

Given a particular function, we are often interested in determining the
largest and smallest values of the function. This information is important in
creating accurate graphs. Finding the maximum and minimum values of a
function also has practical significance because we can use this method to
solve optimization problems, such as maximizing profit, minimizing the
amount of material used in manufacturing an aluminum can, or finding the
maximum height a rocket can reach. In this section, we look at how to use
derivatives to find the largest and smallest values for a function.

Absolute Extrema

Consider the function f(x) = x2 + 1 over the interval (-, ). As

x  ±, f(x)  . Therefore, the function does not have a largest

value.  However,     since         2  +  1    1  for  all  real  numbers  x  and      2  +  1  =  1

                               x                                                  x

when x = 0, the function has a smallest value, 1, when x = 0. We say that

1 is the absolute minimum of f(x) = x2 + 1 and it occurs at x = 0. We

say  that  f (x)  =      2  +  1  does   not  have    an   absolute  maximum      (see   the

                     x

following figure).
     The given function has an absolute minimum of 1 at
        x = 0. The function does not have an absolute
                              maximum.

Note:
Definition
Let f be a function defined over an interval I and let c  I. We say f has
an absolute maximum on I at c if f(c)  f(x) for all x  I. We say f
has an absolute minimum on I at c if f(c)  f(x) for all x  I. If f has
an absolute maximum on I at c or an absolute minimum on I at c, we say
f has an absolute extremum on I at c.

Before proceeding, let's note two important issues regarding this definition.
First, the term absolute here does not refer to absolute value. An absolute
extremum may be positive, negative, or zero. Second, if a function f has an
absolute extremum over an interval I at c, the absolute extremum is f(c).
The real number c is a point in the domain at which the absolute extremum
occurs. For example, consider the function f(x) = 1/(x2 + 1) over the
interval (-, ). Since
Equation:

f (0) = 1         1  = f (x)
            x2 + 1

for all real numbers x, we say f has an absolute maximum over (-, )
at x = 0. The absolute maximum is f(0) = 1. It occurs at x = 0, as shown
in [link](b).

A function may have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum,
just one extremum, or neither. [link] shows several functions and some of
the different possibilities regarding absolute extrema. However, the
following theorem, called the Extreme Value Theorem, guarantees that a
continuous function f over a closed, bounded interval [a, b] has both an
absolute maximum and an absolute minimum.
   Graphs (a), (b), and (c) show several possibilities for absolute extrema
     for functions with a domain of (-, ). Graphs (d), (e), and (f)
     show several possibilities for absolute extrema for functions with a
                         domain that is a bounded interval.

Note:
Extreme Value Theorem
If f is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [a, b], then
there is a point in [a, b] at which f has an absolute maximum over [a, b]
and there is a point in [a, b] at which f has an absolute minimum over

[a, b].

The proof of the extreme value theorem is beyond the scope of this text.
Typically, it is proved in a course on real analysis. There are a couple of key
points to note about the statement of this theorem. For the extreme value
theorem to apply, the function must be continuous over a closed, bounded
interval. If the interval I is open or the function has even one point of
discontinuity, the function may not have an absolute maximum or absolute
minimum over I. For example, consider the functions shown in [link](d),
(e), and (f). All three of these functions are defined over bounded intervals.
However, the function in graph (e) is the only one that has both an absolute
maximum and an absolute minimum over its domain. The extreme value
theorem cannot be applied to the functions in graphs (d) and (f) because
neither of these functions is continuous over a closed, bounded interval.
Although the function in graph (d) is defined over the closed interval [0, 4],
the function is discontinuous at x = 2. The function has an absolute
maximum over [0, 4] but does not have an absolute minimum. The function
in graph (f) is continuous over the half-open interval [0, 2), but is not
defined at x = 2, and therefore is not continuous over a closed, bounded
interval. The function has an absolute minimum over [0, 2), but does not
have an absolute maximum over [0, 2). These two graphs illustrate why a
function over a bounded interval may fail to have an absolute maximum
and/or absolute minimum.

Before looking at how to find absolute extrema, let's examine the related
concept of local extrema. This idea is useful in determining where absolute
extrema occur.

Local Extrema and Critical Points
Consider the function f shown in [link]. The graph can be described as two
mountains with a valley in the middle. The absolute maximum value of the
function occurs at the higher peak, at x = 2. However, x = 0 is also a point
of interest. Although f (0) is not the largest value of f, the value f (0) is
larger than f (x) for all x near 0. We say f has a local maximum at x = 0.
Similarly, the function f does not have an absolute minimum, but it does
have a local minimum at x = 1 because f (1) is less than f (x) for x near
1.

        This function f has two local
   maxima and one local minimum. The
    local maximum at x = 2 is also the

             absolute maximum.
Note:
Definition
A function f has a local maximum at c if there exists an open interval I
containing c such that I is contained in the domain of f and f(c)  f(x)
for all x  I. A function f has a local minimum at c if there exists an
open interval I containing c such that I is contained in the domain of f and
f(c)  f(x) for all x  I. A function f has a local extremum at c if f
has a local maximum at c or f has a local minimum at c.

Note that if f has an absolute extremum at c and f is defined over an
interval containing c, then f(c) is also considered a local extremum. If an
absolute extremum for a function f occurs at an endpoint, we do not
consider that to be a local extremum, but instead refer to that as an endpoint
extremum.

Given the graph of a function f, it is sometimes easy to see where a local
maximum or local minimum occurs. However, it is not always easy to see,
since the interesting features on the graph of a function may not be visible
because they occur at a very small scale. Also, we may not have a graph of
the function. In these cases, how can we use a formula for a function to
determine where these extrema occur?

To answer this question, let's look at [link] again. The local extrema occur
at x = 0, x = 1, and x = 2. Notice that at x = 0 and x = 1, the derivative
f(x) = 0. At x = 2, the derivative f(x) does not exist, since the function
f has a corner there. In fact, if f has a local extremum at a point x = c, the
derivative f(c) must satisfy one of the following conditions: either
f(c) = 0 or f(c) is undefined. Such a value c is known as a critical point
and it is important in finding extreme values for functions.

Note:
Definition
Let c be an interior point in the domain of f. We say that c is a critical
point of f if f(c) = 0 or f(c) is undefined.

As mentioned earlier, if f has a local extremum at a point x = c, then c
must be a critical point of f. This fact is known as Fermat's theorem.

Note:
Fermat's Theorem
If f has a local extremum at c and f is differentiable at c, then f(c) = 0.

Proof

Suppose f has a local extremum at c and f is differentiable at c. We need to
show that f(c) = 0. To do this, we will show that f(c)  0 and
f(c)  0, and therefore f(c) = 0. Since f has a local extremum at c, f
has a local maximum or local minimum at c. Suppose f has a local
maximum at c. The case in which f has a local minimum at c can be
handled similarly. There then exists an open interval I such that
f (c)  f (x) for all x  I. Since f is differentiable at c, from the
definition of the derivative, we know that
Equation:

             f (x) - f (c)

f (c) = lim                 .

xc           x-c

Since this limit exists, both one-sided limits also exist and equal f(c).
Therefore,
Equation:

             f (x) - f (c)

f (c) = lim                 ,

xc+          x-c
and
Equation:

                        f (x) - f (c)

           f (c) = lim                 .

           xc-          x-c

Since f(c) is a local maximum, we see that f(x) - f(c)  0 for x near c.

                                                                                                                                                   f (x)-f (c)

Therefore, for x near c, but x > c, we have x-c  0. From [link] we
conclude that f(c)  0. Similarly, it can be shown that f(c)  0.
Therefore, f(c) = 0.



From Fermat's theorem, we conclude that if f has a local extremum at c,
then either f(c) = 0 or f(c) is undefined. In other words, local extrema
can only occur at critical points.

Note this theorem does not claim that a function f must have a local
extremum at a critical point. Rather, it states that critical points are
candidates for local extrema. For example, consider the function
f (x) = x3. We have f(x) = 3x2 = 0 when x = 0. Therefore, x = 0 is a
critical point. However, f(x) = x3 is increasing over (-, ), and thus f
does not have a local extremum at x = 0. In [link], we see several different
possibilities for critical points. In some of these cases, the functions have
local extrema at critical points, whereas in other cases the functions do not.
Note that these graphs do not show all possibilities for the behavior of a
function at a critical point.
      (a-e) A function f has a critical point at c if f(c) = 0 or f(c) is
      undefined. A function may or may not have a local extremum at a

                                      critical point.

Later in this chapter we look at analytical methods for determining whether
a function actually has a local extremum at a critical point. For now, let's
turn our attention to finding critical points. We will use graphical
observations to determine whether a critical point is associated with a local
extremum.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Locating Critical Points
For each of the following functions, find all critical points. Use a
graphing utility to determine whether the function has a local
extremum at each of the critical points.

a. f (x) = 1 x3 - 5 x2 + 4x
3                                          2

b. f (x) = (x2 - 1)3

c. f (x) = 2 4x
                                      1+x

Solution:

   a. The derivative f(x) = x2 - 5x + 4 is defined for all real
      numbers x. Therefore, we only need to find the values for x
      where f(x) = 0. Since
      f(x) = x2 - 5x + 4 = (x - 4) (x - 1), the critical points are
      x = 1 and x = 4. From the graph of f in [link], we see that f
      has a local maximum at x = 1 and a local minimum at x = 4.

      This function has a local maximum
              and a local minimum.

b. Using the chain rule, we see the derivative is
  Equation:
                                22                             22
                f (x) = 3(x - 1) (2x) = 6x(x - 1) .

Therefore, f has critical points when x = 0 and when

    2  -  1  =  0.       We  conclude  that  the  critical  points  are  x  =    0,  ±1.

From the graph of f in [link], we see that f has a local (and

absolute) minimum at x = 0, but does not have a local

extremum at x = 1 or x = -1.

       This function has three critical points: x = 0, x = 1,
       and x = -1. The function has a local (and absolute)
       minimum at x = 0, but does not have extrema at the

                        other two critical points.

c. By the chain rule, we see that the derivative is
  Equation:

                                                       2       4 - 4x2

                                (1 + x 4) - 4x (2x)

             f (x) =                                        =               .

                                (1 + x2 2 )                    (1 + x2 2 )

The derivative is defined everywhere. Therefore, we only need to

find values for x where f(x) = 0. Solving f(x) = 0, we see

that   4  -           2  =  0,  which  implies  x  =  ±1.   Therefore,      the  critical

             4x

points are x = ±1. From the graph of f in [link], we see that f
has an absolute maximum at x = 1 and an absolute minimum at
x = -1. Hence, f has a local maximum at x = 1 and a local
minimum at x = -1. (Note that if f has an absolute extremum
over an interval I at a point c that is not an endpoint of I, then f
has a local extremum at c. )

           This function has an absolute
            maximum and an absolute
                      minimum.

Locating Absolute Extrema

The extreme value theorem states that a continuous function over a closed,
bounded interval has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum. As
shown in [link], one or both of these absolute extrema could occur at an
endpoint. If an absolute extremum does not occur at an endpoint, however,
it must occur at an interior point, in which case the absolute extremum is a
local extremum. Therefore, by [link], the point c at which the local
extremum occurs must be a critical point. We summarize this result in the
following theorem.

Note:
Location of Absolute Extrema
Let f be a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval I. The
absolute maximum of f over I and the absolute minimum of f over I must
occur at endpoints of I or at critical points of f in I.

With this idea in mind, let's examine a procedure for locating absolute
extrema.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Locating Absolute Extrema over a Closed
Interval
Consider a continuous function f defined over the closed interval [a, b].

   1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x = a and x = b.
   2. Find all critical points of f that lie over the interval (a, b) and

      evaluate f at those critical points.
3. Compare all values found in (1) and (2). From [link], the absolute
  extrema must occur at endpoints or critical points. Therefore, the
  largest of these values is the absolute maximum of f. The smallest of
  these values is the absolute minimum of f.

Now let's look at how to use this strategy to find the absolute maximum and
absolute minimum values for continuous functions.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Locating Absolute Extrema

   For each of the following functions, find the absolute maximum and
   absolute minimum over the specified interval and state where those
   values occur.

      a. f(x) = -x2 + 3x - 2 over [1, 3].
      b. f (x) = x2 - 3x2/3 over [0, 2].

Solution:

   a. Step 1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x = 1 and x = 3.
      Equation:

                                                        f (1) = 0 and f (3) = -2

Step 2. Since f(x) = -2x + 3, f is defined for all real

numbers x. Therefore, there are no critical points where the

derivative is undefined. It remains to check where f(x) = 0.

Since f(x) = -2x + 3 = 0 at x = 3 and 3 is in the interval
2  2
[1,  3],  f  (  3  )  is  a  candidate      for  an  absolute                               extremum  of  f   over
                2

[1, 3]. We evaluate f ( 3 ) and find
                                                                            2

Equation:

                                                  3                               1
                                        f( ) =                                        .

                                                  2                               4

Step 3. We set up the following table to compare the values
found in steps 1 and 2.

     x                f (x)                 Conclusion

     0                0                     Absolute maximum
                                            Absolute minimum
     3                1

     2                4

     3                -2

From the table, we find that the absolute maximum of f over the

interval [1, 3] is           1  ,  and  it  occurs  at                         x  =      3  .  The  absolute
                             4                                                           2

minimum of f over the interval [1, 3] is -2, and it occurs at

x = 3 as shown in the following graph.
This function has both an absolute maximum and an
                    absolute minimum.

b. Step 1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x = 0 and x = 2.
  Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                       3

                               f (0) = 0 and f (2) = 4 - 34  -0.762

Step 2. The derivative of f is given by
Equation:

              2                          2x4/3  -2

f (x) = 2x -        =

              x1/3                           x1/3

for x  0. The derivative is zero when 2x4/3 - 2 = 0, which
implies x = ±1. The derivative is undefined at x = 0.
Therefore, the critical points of f are x = 0, 1, -1. The point
x = 0 is an endpoint, so we already evaluated f(0) in step 1.
The point x = -1 is not in the interval of interest, so we need
only evaluate f (1). We find that
Equation:
                                                             f (1) = -2.

Step 3. We compare the values found in steps 1 and 2, in the
following table.

x  f (x)   Conclusion
           Absolute maximum
0  0       Absolute minimum

1  -2

2  -0.762

We conclude that the absolute maximum of f over the interval
[0, 2] is zero, and it occurs at x = 0. The absolute minimum is
-2, and it occurs at x = 1 as shown in the following graph.
                 This function has an absolute
                maximum at an endpoint of the

                              interval.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of
   f(x) = x2 - 4x + 3 over the interval [1, 4].
   Solution:
   The absolute maximum is 3 and it occurs at x = 4. The absolute
   minimum is -1 and it occurs at x = 2.
Hint

Look for critical points. Evaluate f at all critical points and at the
endpoints.

At this point, we know how to locate absolute extrema for continuous
functions over closed intervals. We have also defined local extrema and
determined that if a function f has a local extremum at a point c, then c
must be a critical point of f. However, c being a critical point is not a
sufficient condition for f to have a local extremum at c. Later in this
chapter, we show how to determine whether a function actually has a local
extremum at a critical point. First, however, we need to introduce the Mean
Value Theorem, which will help as we analyze the behavior of the graph of
a function.

Key Concepts

      A function may have both an absolute maximum and an absolute
      minimum, have just one absolute extremum, or have no absolute
      maximum or absolute minimum.
      If a function has a local extremum, the point at which it occurs must be
      a critical point. However, a function need not have a local extremum at
      a critical point.
      A continuous function over a closed, bounded interval has an absolute
      maximum and an absolute minimum. Each extremum occurs at a
      critical point or an endpoint.

The Mean Value Theorem
      Explain the meaning of Rolle's theorem.
      Describe the significance of the Mean Value Theorem.
      State three important consequences of the Mean Value Theorem.

The Mean Value Theorem is one of the most important theorems in
calculus. We look at some of its implications at the end of this section. First,
let's start with a special case of the Mean Value Theorem, called Rolle's
theorem.

Rolle's Theorem

Informally, Rolle's theorem states that if the outputs of a differentiable
function f are equal at the endpoints of an interval, then there must be an
interior point c where f(c) = 0. [link] illustrates this theorem.

    If a differentiable function f satisfies f(a) = f(b), then its derivative
                 must be zero at some point(s) between a and b.

Note:
Rolle's Theorem
Let f be a continuous function over the closed interval [a, b] and
differentiable over the open interval (a, b) such that f (a) = f (b). There
then exists at least one c  (a, b) such that f(c) = 0.

Proof

Let k = f(a) = f(b). We consider three cases:

   1. f (x) = k for all x  (a, b).
   2. There exists x  (a, b) such that f (x) > k.
   3. There exists x  (a, b) such that f (x) < k.

Case 1: If f (x) = 0 for all x  (a, b), then f(x) = 0 for all x  (a, b).

Case 2: Since f is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval
[a, b], by the extreme value theorem, it has an absolute maximum. Also,
since there is a point x  (a, b) such that f (x) > k, the absolute maximum
is greater than k. Therefore, the absolute maximum does not occur at either
endpoint. As a result, the absolute maximum must occur at an interior point
c  (a, b). Because f has a maximum at an interior point c, and f is
differentiable at c, by Fermat's theorem, f(c) = 0.

Case 3: The case when there exists a point x  (a, b) such that f (x) < k is
analogous to case 2, with maximum replaced by minimum.



An important point about Rolle's theorem is that the differentiability of the
function f is critical. If f is not differentiable, even at a single point, the
result may not hold. For example, the function f (x) = |x| - 1 is
continuous over [-1, 1] and f (-1) = 0 = f (1), but f(c)  0 for any
c  (-1, 1) as shown in the following figure.
       Since f(x) = |x| - 1 is not
        differentiable at x = 0, the
    conditions of Rolle's theorem are
   not satisfied. In fact, the conclusion
      does not hold here; there is no
    c  (-1, 1) such that f(c) = 0.

Let's now consider functions that satisfy the conditions of Rolle's theorem
and calculate explicitly the points c where f(c) = 0.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Using Rolle's Theorem

   For each of the following functions, verify that the function satisfies
   the criteria stated in Rolle's theorem and find all values c in the given
   interval where f(c) = 0.

      a. f (x) = x2 + 2x over [-2, 0]
   b. f (x) = x3 - 4x over [-2, 2]

Solution:
   a. Since f is a polynomial, it is continuous and differentiable
      everywhere. In addition, f (-2) = 0 = f (0). Therefore, f
      satisfies the criteria of Rolle's theorem. We conclude that there
      exists at least one value c  (-2, 0) such that f(c) = 0. Since
      f(x) = 2x + 2 = 2 (x + 1), we see that f(c) = 2 (c + 1) = 0
      implies c = -1 as shown in the following graph.

            This function is continuous and differentiable over
                      [-2, 0], f (c) = 0 when c = -1.

   b. As in part a. f is a polynomial and therefore is continuous and
      differentiable everywhere. Also, f (-2) = 0 = f (2). That said,
      f satisfies the criteria of Rolle's theorem. Differentiating, we
      find that f(x) = 3x2 - 4. Therefore, f(c) = 0 when
      x = ± . 2 Both points are in the interval [-2, 2], and, therefore,

                                         3

      both points satisfy the conclusion of Rolle's theorem as shown in
      the following graph.
            For this polynomial over [-2, 2], f(c) = 0 at

                                                              x = ±2/3.

The Mean Value Theorem and Its Meaning

Rolle's theorem is a special case of the Mean Value Theorem. In Rolle's
theorem, we consider differentiable functions f defined on a closed interval
[a, b] with f(a) = f(b). The Mean Value Theorem generalizes Rolle's
theorem by considering functions that do not necessarily have equal value
at the endpoints. Consequently, we can view the Mean Value Theorem as a
slanted version of Rolle's theorem ([link]). The Mean Value Theorem states
that if f is continuous over the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable over
the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c  (a, b) such that the
tangent line to the graph of f at c is parallel to the secant line connecting
(a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)).
The Mean Value Theorem says that for a function
that meets its conditions, at some point the tangent
line has the same slope as the secant line between
the ends. For this function, there are two values c1
 and c2 such that the tangent line to f at c1 and c2

        has the same slope as the secant line.

Note:
Mean Value Theorem
Let f be continuous over the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable over
the open interval (a, b). Then, there exists at least one point c  (a, b) such
that
Equation:

f (c) =  f (b) - f (a)
                                         .

                 b-a
Proof

The proof follows from Rolle's theorem by introducing an appropriate
function that satisfies the criteria of Rolle's theorem. Consider the line
connecting (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)). Since the slope of that line is
Equation:

                                                                         f (b) - f (a)
                                                                                  b-a

and the line passes through the point (a, f (a)), the equation of that line can
be written as
Equation:

y=  f (b) - f (a)
                                    (x - a) + f (a).

            b-a

Let g (x) denote the vertical difference between the point (x, f (x)) and the
point (x, y) on that line. Therefore,
Equation:

                   f (b) - f (a)

g (x) = f (x) - [                 (x - a) + f (a)].

                   b-a
  The value g(x) is the vertical
  difference between the point
(x, f(x)) and the point (x, y) on

    the secant line connecting
     (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)).

Since the graph of f intersects the secant line when x = a and x = b, we
see that g (a) = 0 = g (b). Since f is a differentiable function over (a, b), g
is also a differentiable function over (a, b). Furthermore, since f is
continuous over [a, b], g is also continuous over [a, b]. Therefore, g satisfies
the criteria of Rolle's theorem. Consequently, there exists a point c  (a, b)
such that g(c) = 0. Since
Equation:

             g(x) = f (x) -        f (b) - f (a)
                                                                   ,

                                            b-a

we see that
Equation:
                        g(c) = f (c) -       f (b) - f (a)
                                                                             .

                                                      b-a

Since g(c) = 0, we conclude that
Equation:

                             f (c) =   f (b) - f (a)
                                                                       .

                                                b-a



In the next example, we show how the Mean Value Theorem can be applied
to the function f(x) = x over the interval [0, 9]. The method is the same
for other functions, although sometimes with more interesting
consequences.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Verifying that the Mean Value Theorem Applies

For f (x) = x over the interval [0, 9], show that f satisfies the

hypothesis of the Mean Value Theorem, and therefore there exists at

least  one  value  c    (0,  9)  such  that  f        is  equal           to    the  slope  of  the

                                                 (c)

line connecting (0, f (0)) and (9, f (9)). Find these values c

guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem.

Solution:

We know that f(x) = x is continuous over [0, 9] and differentiable
over (0, 9). Therefore, f satisfies the hypotheses of the Mean Value
Theorem, and there must exist at least one value c  (0, 9) such that
f  (c) is equal to the slope of the line connecting (0, f (0)) and
(9, f (9)) ([link]). To determine which value(s) of c are guaranteed,

first calculate the derivative of f. The derivative f  (x) = 1 . The

                                                                                                                                                                                                   (2x)

slope of the line connecting (0, f(0)) and (9, f(9)) is given by
Equation:

           f (9) - f (0)     9 - 0                  3         1

                          =                 =           =.

           9-0                  9-0                 9         3

We want to find c such that f (c) =  1  .  That  is,  we  want   to   find  c
                                     3

such that

Equation:

                             1          1

                                =.

                          2c            3

Solving this equation for c, we obtain c =  9    .  At  this  point,  the  slope
                                            4

of the tangent line equals the slope of the line joining the endpoints.

The slope of the tangent line at c = 9/4 is the same as the slope
         of the line segment connecting (0, 0) and (9, 3).
One application that helps illustrate the Mean Value Theorem involves
velocity. For example, suppose we drive a car for 1 h down a straight road
with an average velocity of 45 mph. Let s(t) and v (t) denote the position
and velocity of the car, respectively, for 0  t  1 h. Assuming that the
position function s (t) is differentiable, we can apply the Mean Value
Theorem to conclude that, at some time c  (0, 1), the speed of the car was
exactly
Equation:

                                 s (1) - s (0)  = 45 mph.

   Mean Value Theorem and Velocity

   If a rock is dropped from a height of 100 ft, its position t seconds after
   it is dropped until it hits the ground is given by the function

     s (t) = -16t2 + 100.

      a. Determine how long it takes before the rock hits the ground.
      b. Find the average velocity vavg of the rock for when the rock is

         released and the rock hits the ground.
      c. Find the time t guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem when the

         instantaneous velocity of the rock is vavg.

   Solution:
a. When the rock hits the ground, its position is s(t) = 0. Solving

the equation -16t2 + 100 = 0 for t, we find that t = ± 5 sec.
                                                                                                                                                                                            2

Since we are only considering t  0, the ball will hit the ground

5     sec after it is dropped.

b. The average velocity is given by

Equation:

                   s(5/2) - s(0)         1 - 100

           vavg =                     =           = -40 f t/sec.

                     5/2 - 0             5/2

c. The instantaneous velocity is given by the derivative of the
  position function. Therefore, we need to find a time t such that
  v(t) = s(t) = vavg = -40 ft/sec. Since s(t) is continuous
  over the interval [0, 5/2] and differentiable over the interval
  (0, 5/2), by the Mean Value Theorem, there is guaranteed to be a
  point c  (0, 5/2) such that
  Equation:

                              s (5/2) - s (0)   = -40.
                                      5/2 - 0
                     s (c) =

Taking the derivative of the position function s (t), we find that

      (t)  =  -32t.  Therefore,  the  equation  reduces  to

s

s (c) = -32c = -40. Solving this equation for c, we have

c=         5 . Therefore,  5  sec after the rock is dropped, the
                           4
           4

instantaneous velocity equals the average velocity of the rock

during its free fall: -40 ft/sec.
               At time t = 5/4 sec, the velocity of the rock is
               equal to its average velocity from the time it is

                        dropped until it hits the ground.

Corollaries of the Mean Value Theorem

Let's now look at three corollaries of the Mean Value Theorem. These
results have important consequences, which we use in upcoming sections.

At this point, we know the derivative of any constant function is zero. The
Mean Value Theorem allows us to conclude that the converse is also true. In
particular, if f  (x) = 0 for all x in some interval I, then f (x) is constant
over that interval. This result may seem intuitively obvious, but it has
important implications that are not obvious, and we discuss them shortly.

Note:
Corollary 1: Functions with a Derivative of Zero
Let f be differentiable over an interval I. If f  (x) = 0 for all x  I, then
f (x) = constant for all x  I.

Proof

Since f is differentiable over I, f must be continuous over I. Suppose
f (x) is not constant for all x in I. Then there exist a, b  I, where a  b
and f (a)  f (b). Choose the notation so that a < b. Therefore,
Equation:

f (b) - f (a)   0.
        b-a
Since f is a differentiable function, by the Mean Value Theorem, there
exists c  (a, b) such that
Equation:

                                                          f (b) - f (a)
                                                                                          .
                                    f (c) =
                                                                  b-a

Therefore, there exists c  I such that f  (c)  0, which contradicts the

assumption     that         (x)  =  0          for   all  x    I.

                     f



From [link], it follows that if two functions have the same derivative, they
differ by, at most, a constant.

Note:

Corollary 2: Constant Difference Theorem

If  f  and  g  are  differentiable             over  an      interval  I  and                       (x)  =        (x)  for  all

                                                                                             f              g

x  I, then f (x) = g (x) + C for some constant C.

Proof

Let h (x) = f (x) - g (x). Then, h (x) = f  (x) - g (x) = 0 for all
x  I. By Corollary 1, there is a constant C such that h(x) = C for all
x  I. Therefore, f(x) = g(x) + C for all x  I.



The third corollary of the Mean Value Theorem discusses when a function

is increasing and when it is decreasing. Recall that a function f is

increasing over I if f (x1) < f (x2) whenever x1 < x2, whereas f is

decreasing     over  I  if  f (x)              >  f  (x2)    whenever     x1  <              x2.    Using         the  Mean

                                            1

Value Theorem, we can show that if the derivative of a function is positive,
then the function is increasing; if the derivative is negative, then the
function is decreasing ([link]). We make use of this fact in the next section,
where we show how to use the derivative of a function to locate local
maximum and minimum values of the function, and how to determine the
shape of the graph.
This fact is important because it means that for a given function f, if there
exists a function F such that F  (x) = f (x); then, the only other functions
that have a derivative equal to f are F (x) + C for some constant C. We
discuss this result in more detail later in the chapter.

     If a function has a positive derivative over some interval I, then the
      function increases over that interval I; if the derivative is negative
    over some interval I, then the function decreases over that interval I.

Note:
Corollary 3: Increasing and Decreasing Functions
Let f be continuous over the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable over
the open interval (a, b).
i.  If         (x)  >  0  for  all  x    (a,  b),  then  f  is  an  increasing   function  over

        f

      [a, b].

ii. If f (x) < 0 for all x  (a, b), then f is a decreasing function over

    [a, b].

Proof

We will prove i.; the proof of ii. is similar. Suppose f is not an increasing
function on I. Then there exist a and b in I such that a < b, but
f (a)  f (b). Since f is a differentiable function over I, by the Mean
Value Theorem there exists c  (a, b) such that
Equation:

                                              f (b) - f (a)
                                                                              .
                                    f (c) =
                                                      b-a

Since f (a)  f (b), we know that f(b) - f(a)  0. Also, a < b tells us
that b - a > 0. We conclude that
Equation:

                                         f (b) - f (a)           0.
                                                 b-a
                               f (c) =

However, f  (x) > 0 for all x  I. This is a contradiction, and therefore f
must be an increasing function over I.



Key Concepts

      If f is continuous over [a, b] and differentiable over (a, b) and
      f (a) = 0 = f (b), then there exists a point c  (a, b) such that
f  (c) = 0. This is Rolle's theorem.
If f is continuous over [a, b] and differentiable over (a, b), then there
exists a point c  (a, b) such that
Equation:

                         f (c) =       f (b) - f (a)
                                                                       .

                                               b-a

This is the Mean Value Theorem.

If f(x) = 0 over an interval I, then f is constant over I.

If  two  differentiable  functions  f  and  g  satisfy                    =         over  I,

                                                        f (x)                g (x)

then f (x) = g (x) + C for some constant C.

If f  (x) > 0 over an interval I, then f is increasing over I. If

f (x) < 0 over I, then f is decreasing over I.

      Explain how the sign of the first derivative affects the shape of a function's
      graph.
      State the first derivative test for critical points.
      Use concavity and inflection points to explain how the sign of the second
      derivative affects the shape of a function's graph.
      Explain the concavity test for a function over an open interval.
      Explain the relationship between a function and its first and second
      derivatives.
      State the second derivative test for local extrema.

Earlier in this chapter we stated that if a function f has a local extremum at a point

c, then c must be a critical point of f. However, a function is not guaranteed to

have  a  local  extremum  at  a  critical  point.  For  example,  f (x)  =      3  has  a  critical

                                                                            x

point at x = 0 since f(x) = 3x2 is zero at x = 0, but f does not have a local

extremum at x = 0. Using the results from the previous section, we are now able

to determine whether a critical point of a function actually corresponds to a local

extreme value. In this section, we also see how the second derivative provides

information about the shape of a graph by describing whether the graph of a

function curves upward or curves downward.

The First Derivative Test

Corollary 3 of the Mean Value Theorem showed that if the derivative of a function
is positive over an interval I then the function is increasing over I. On the other
hand, if the derivative of the function is negative over an interval I, then the
function is decreasing over I as shown in the following figure.
Both functions are increasing over the interval (a, b).
   At each point x, the derivative f(x) > 0. Both

 functions are decreasing over the interval (a, b). At
        each point x, the derivative f(x) < 0.

A continuous function f has a local maximum at point c if and only if f switches

from increasing to decreasing at point c. Similarly, f has a local minimum at c if

and only if f switches from decreasing to increasing at c. If f is a continuous

function over an interval I containing c and differentiable over I, except possibly

at c, the only way f can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) at

point c is if f  changes sign as x increases through c. If f is differentiable at c, the

only  way  that  f      can  change  sign  as  x  increases  through  c  is  if  f    (c)  =  0.

                     .

Therefore, for a function f that is continuous over an interval I containing c and
differentiable over I, except possibly at c, the only way f can switch from

increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) is if f(c) = 0 or f  (c) is undefined.

Consequently, to locate local extrema for a function f, we look for points c in the

domain  of  f  such  that  f (c)  =  0  or         (c)  is  undefined.  Recall  that  such  points  are

                                            f

called critical points of f.

Note that f need not have a local extrema at a critical point. The critical points are
candidates for local extrema only. In [link], we show that if a continuous function
f has a local extremum, it must occur at a critical point, but a function may not
have a local extremum at a critical point. We show that if f has a local extremum
at a critical point, then the sign of f  switches as x increases through that point.

     The function f has four critical points: a, b, c, and d. The function f has
    local maxima at a and d, and a local minimum at b. The function f does not

       have a local extremum at c. The sign of f changes at all local extrema.

Using [link], we summarize the main results regarding local extrema.
      If a continuous function f has a local extremum, it must occur at a critical
      point c.
      The function has a local extremum at the critical point c if and only if the
      derivative f  switches sign as x increases through c.
      Therefore, to test whether a function has a local extremum at a critical point
      c, we must determine the sign of f  (x) to the left and right of c.

This result is known as the first derivative test.

Note:
First Derivative Test
Suppose that f is a continuous function over an interval I containing a critical
point c. If f is differentiable over I, except possibly at point c, then f (c) satisfies
one of the following descriptions:

    i. If f  changes sign from positive when x < c to negative when x > c, then
      f (c) is a local maximum of f.

   ii. If f  changes sign from negative when x < c to positive when x > c, then
      f (c) is a local minimum of f.

  iii. If f has the same sign for x < c and x > c, then f (c) is neither a local
      maximum nor a local minimum of f.

We can summarize the first derivative test as a strategy for locating local extrema.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Using the First Derivative Test
Consider a function f that is continuous over an interval I.

   1. Find all critical points of f and divide the interval I into smaller intervals
      using the critical points as endpoints.

   2. Analyze the sign of f in each of the subintervals. If f is continuous over a
      given subinterval (which is typically the case), then the sign of f in that
      subinterval does not change and, therefore, can be determined by choosing
      an arbitrary test point x in that subinterval and by evaluating the sign of f at
      that test point. Use the sign analysis to determine whether f is increasing or
      decreasing over that interval.
3. Use [link] and the results of step 2 to determine whether f has a local
  maximum, a local minimum, or neither at each of the critical points.

Now let's look at how to use this strategy to locate all local extrema for particular
functions.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Using the First Derivative Test to Find Local Extrema

Use the first derivative test to find the location of all local extrema for

f  (x)  =      3  -           2  -  9x  -  1.  Use  a  graphing  utility  to  confirm  your  results.

           x         3x

Solution:

Step 1. The derivative is f  (x) = 3x2 - 6x - 9. To find the critical points,
we need to find where f  (x) = 0. Factoring the polynomial, we conclude
that the critical points must satisfy
Equation:

                                 2

                     3(x - 2x - 3) = 3 (x - 3) (x + 1) = 0.

Therefore, the critical points are x = 3, -1. Now divide the interval
(-, ) into the smaller intervals (-, -1), (-1, 3) and (3, ).

Step 2. Since f is a continuous function, to determine the sign of f  (x) over
each subinterval, it suffices to choose a point over each of the intervals
(-, -1), (-1, 3) and (3, ) and determine the sign of f  at each of
these points. For example, let's choose x = -2, x = 0, and x = 4 as test
points.

                  (+) (-) (+) = -

                  (+) (+) (+) = +

Step 3. Since f  switches sign from positive to negative as x increases
through 1, f has a local maximum at x = -1. Since f  switches sign from
negative to positive as x increases through 3, f has a local minimum at
x = 3. These analytical results agree with the following graph.
The function f has a maximum at x = -1 and a
                 minimum at x = 3

           5x               x.

Solution:

Step 1. The derivative is
Equation:

             5     -2/3         5    2/3     5 5x2/3 5 - 5x4/3 5 (1 - x4/3)

f (x) = x                      -x         =            -            =              =                .

             3 3 3x2/3 3 3x2/3                                                               3x2/3

The derivative f  (x) = 0 when 1 - x4/3 = 0. Therefore, f  (x) = 0 at
x = ±1. The derivative f  (x) is undefined at x = 0. Therefore, we have
three critical points: x = 0, x = 1, and x = -1. Consequently, divide the
interval (-, ) into the smaller intervals (-, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1), and

(1, ).
Step 2: Since f  is continuous over each subinterval, it suffices to choose a
test point x in each of the intervals from step 1 and determine the sign of f 

at each of these points. The points x = -2, x = - 2 , x = 2 , and x = 2 1 1
are test points for these intervals.

Step 3: Since f is decreasing over the interval (-, -1) and increasing
over the interval (-1, 0), f has a local minimum at x = -1. Since f is
increasing over the interval (-1, 0) and the interval (0, 1), f does not have a
local extremum at x = 0. Since f is increasing over the interval (0, 1) and
decreasing over the interval (1, ), f has a local maximum at x = 1. The
analytical results agree with the following graph.
The function f has a local minimum at
   x = -1 and a local maximum at

                                    x = 1.

   Solution:
   f has no local extrema because f  does not change sign at x = 1.
Hint
The only critical point of f is x = 1.

Concavity and Points of Inflection
We now know how to determine where a function is increasing or decreasing.
However, there is another issue to consider regarding the shape of the graph of a
function. If the graph curves, does it curve upward or curve downward? This
notion is called the concavity of the function.

[link](a) shows a function f with a graph that curves upward. As x increases, the
slope of the tangent line increases. Thus, since the derivative increases as x
increases, f  is an increasing function. We say this function f is concave up. [link]
(b) shows a function f that curves downward. As x increases, the slope of the
tangent line decreases. Since the derivative decreases as x increases, f  is a
decreasing function. We say this function f is concave down.

Note:

Definition

Let f be a function that is differentiable over an open interval I. If f  is

increasing  over  I,  we  say  f  is  concave  up  over  I.  If         is  decreasing  over  I,  we

                                                                 f

say f is concave down over I.
(a), (c) Since f is increasing over the interval (a, b), we say f is concave
up over (a, b). (b), (d) Since f is decreasing over the interval (a, b), we

                       say f is concave down over (a, b).

In general, without having the graph of a function f, how can we determine its

concavity?  By  definition,  a  function  f  is  concave  up  if         is  increasing.  From

                                                                  f

Corollary 3, we know that if f  is a differentiable function, then f  is increasing if

its derivative f (x) > 0. Therefore, a function f that is twice differentiable is
concave  up  when  f   (x)  >  0.  Similarly,  a  function  f  is  concave  down  if         is

                                                                                      f

decreasing. We know that a differentiable function f  is decreasing if its derivative

f (x) < 0. Therefore, a twice-differentiable function f is concave down when

f (x) < 0. Applying this logic is known as the concavity test.

Note:
Test for Concavity
Let f be a function that is twice differentiable over an interval I.

   i. If f (x) > 0 for all x  I, then f is concave up over I.
  ii. If f (x) < 0 for all x  I, then f is concave down over I.

We conclude that we can determine the concavity of a function f by looking at the
second derivative of f. In addition, we observe that a function f can switch
concavity ([link]). However, a continuous function can switch concavity only at a
point x if f (x) = 0 or f (x) is undefined. Consequently, to determine the
intervals where a function f is concave up and concave down, we look for those
values of x where f (x) = 0 or f (x) is undefined. When we have determined
these points, we divide the domain of f into smaller intervals and determine the
sign of f over each of these smaller intervals. If f changes sign as we pass
through a point x, then f changes concavity. It is important to remember that a
function f may not change concavity at a point x even if f (x) = 0 or f (x) is
undefined. If, however, f does change concavity at a point a and f is continuous
at a, we say the point (a, f (a)) is an inflection point of f.

Note:
Definition
If f is continuous at a and f changes concavity at a, the point (a, f (a)) is an
inflection point of f.
    Since f (x) > 0 for x < a, the function f is concave up over the interval
   (-, a). Since f (x) < 0 for x > a, the function f is concave down over

         the interval (a, ). The point (a, f (a)) is an inflection point of f.

Example:

   Problem:
   Testing for Concavity

   For the function f (x) = x3 - 6x2 + 9x + 30, determine all intervals where
   f is concave up and all intervals where f is concave down. List all inflection
   points for f. Use a graphing utility to confirm your results.

   Solution:

   To determine concavity, we need to find the second derivative f (x). The
   first derivative is f(x) = 3x2 - 12x + 9, so the second derivative is
   f (x) = 6x - 12. If the function changes concavity, it occurs either when
   f (x) = 0 or f (x) is undefined. Since f is defined for all real numbers
x, we need only find where f (x) = 0. Solving the equation 6x - 12 = 0,
we see that x = 2 is the only place where f could change concavity. We now
test points over the intervals (-, 2) and (2, ) to determine the concavity
of f. The points x = 0 and x = 3 are test points for these intervals.

We conclude that f is concave down over the interval (-, 2) and concave
up over the interval (2, ). Since f changes concavity at x = 2, the point
(2, f (2)) = (2, 32) is an inflection point. [link] confirms the analytical
results.
        The given function has a point of

What Derivatives Tell Us about Graphs
     Consider a twice-differentiable function f over an open interval I. If
f(x) > 0 for all x  I, the function is increasing over I. If f(x) < 0 for all

   x  I, the function is decreasing over I. If f (x) > 0 for all x  I, the
 function is concave up. If f (x) < 0 for all x  I, the function is concave

                                        down on I.

The Second Derivative Test

The first derivative test provides an analytical tool for finding local extrema, but
the second derivative can also be used to locate extreme values. Using the second
derivative can sometimes be a simpler method than using the first derivative.

We know that if a continuous function has a local extrema, it must occur at a

critical point. However, a function need not have a local extrema at a critical point.

Here we examine how the second derivative test can be used to determine

whether a function has a local extremum at a critical point. Let f be a twice-

differentiable function such that f  (a) = 0 and f is continuous over an open

interval I containing a. Suppose f (a) < 0. Since f is continuous over I,

f   (x)  <  0  for  all  x    I  ([link]).  Then,  by  Corollary  3,         is  a  decreasing  function

                                                                      f

over I. Since f  (a) = 0, we conclude that for all x  I, f  (x) > 0 if x < a and

f  (x) < 0 if x > a. Therefore, by the first derivative test, f has a local maximum

at x = a. On the other hand, suppose there exists a point b such that f  (b) = 0 but
f (b) > 0. Since f is continuous over an open interval I containing b, then

f (x) > 0 for all x  I ([link]). Then, by Corollary 3, f  is an increasing

function over I. Since f  (b) = 0, we conclude that for all x  I, f  (x) < 0 if

x  <  b  and         (x)  >  0  if  x  >  b.  Therefore,  by  the  first  derivative  test,  f  has  a  local

              f

minimum at x = b.

   Consider a twice-differentiable function f such that f
   is continuous. Since f(a) = 0 and f (a) < 0, there
   is an interval I containing a such that for all x in I, f
   is increasing if x < a and f is decreasing if x > a. As

       a result, f has a local maximum at x = a. Since
       f(b) = 0 and f (b) > 0, there is an interval I
   containing b such that for all x in I, f is decreasing if
   x < b and f is increasing if x > b. As a result, f has a

                     local minimum at x = b.

Note:
Second Derivative Test
Suppose f  (c) = 0, f is continuous over an interval containing c.

   i. If f (c) > 0, then f has a local minimum at c.
   ii. If f (c) < 0, then f has a local maximum at c.
   iii. If f (c) = 0, then the test is inconclusive.

Note that for case iii. when f (c) = 0, then f may have a local maximum, local

minimum, or neither at c. For example, the functions f (x) = x3, f (x) = x4, and

f  (x)  =             4  all  have  critical  points           at  x  =  0.  In  each  case,  the  second   derivative

           -x

is zero at x = 0. However, the function f (x) = x4 has a local minimum at x = 0

whereas    the  function      f     (x)  =               4  has    a  local  maximum      at  x,  and  the  function

                                              -x

f (x) = x3 does not have a local extremum at x = 0.

Let's now look at how to use the second derivative test to determine whether f has
a local maximum or local minimum at a critical point c where f  (c) = 0.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Using the Second Derivative Test

   Use the second derivative to find the location of all local extrema for

     f (x) = x5 - 5x3.

   Solution:

   To apply the second derivative test, we first need to find critical points c
   where f  (c) = 0. The derivative is f  (x) = 5x4 - 15x2. Therefore,
   f  (x) = 5x4 - 15x2 = 5x2 (x2 - 3) = 0 when x = 0, ±3.

   To determine whether f has a local extrema at any of these points, we need
   to evaluate the sign of f at these points. The second derivative is
   Equation:

                                                            3                          2
                              f  (x) = 20x - 30x = 10x (2x - 3).
In the following table, we evaluate the second derivative at each of the
critical points and use the second derivative test to determine whether f has
a local maximum or local minimum at any of these points.

x                 f  (x)          Conclusion
-3                -303            Local maximum
0                 0               Second derivative test is inconclusive
3                 303             Local minimum

By the second derivative test, we conclude that f has a local maximum at

x = -3 and f has a local minimum at x = 3. The second derivative test
is inconclusive at x = 0. To determine whether f has a local extrema at
x = 0, we apply the first derivative test. To evaluate the sign of

f  (x) = 5x2 (x2 - 3) for x  (-3, 0) and x  (0, 3), let x = -1

and  x  =  1  be  the  two  test  points.  Since         (-1)  <  0  and         (1)  <  0,  we

                                                  f                       f

conclude that f is decreasing on both intervals and, therefore, f does not

have a local extrema at x = 0 as shown in the following graph.
The function f has a local maximum at x = -3 and a local minimum
                                     at x = 3

satisfy         (c)  =  0.  Use  the  second  derivative  test  to  determine  whether  f  has

         f

a local maximum or local minimum at those points.

   Solution:
   f has a local maximum at -2 and a local minimum at 3.
Hint

f  (x) = 6x - 3

We have now developed the tools we need to determine where a function is
increasing and decreasing, as well as acquired an understanding of the basic shape
of the graph. In the next section we discuss what happens to a function as
x  ±. At that point, we have enough tools to provide accurate graphs of a
large variety of functions.

Key Concepts

      If c is a critical point of f and f  (x) > 0 for x < c and f  (x) < 0 for x > c,
      then f has a local maximum at c.
      If c is a critical point of f and f  (x) < 0 for x < c and f  (x) > 0 for x > c,
      then f has a local minimum at c.
      If f (x) > 0 over an interval I, then f is concave up over I.
      If f (x) < 0 over an interval I, then f is concave down over I.
      If f  (c) = 0 and f (c) > 0, then f has a local minimum at c.
      If f  (c) = 0 and f (c) < 0, then f has a local maximum at c.
      If f  (c) = 0 and f (c) = 0, then evaluate f  (x) at a test point x to the left
      of c and a test point x to the right of c, to determine whether f has a local
      extremum at c.

Glossary

concave down
if  f  is  differentiable  over   an     interval  I  and         is  decreasing    over  I,  then  f  is

                                                           f

concave down over I

concave up
      if f is differentiable over an interval I and f  is increasing over I, then f is
      concave up over I

concavity
      the upward or downward curve of the graph of a function

concavity test
      suppose f is twice differentiable over an interval I; if f > 0 over I, then f
      is concave up over I; if f < 0 over I, then f is concave down over I

first derivative test

let f be a continuous function over an interval I containing a critical point c

such that f is differentiable over I except possibly at c; if f  changes sign

from positive to negative as x increases through c, then f has a local

maximum at c; if f  changes sign from negative to positive as x increases

through    c,  then    f  has  a  local  minimum      at  c;  if         does  not  change  sign  as   x

                                                                  f

increases through c, then f does not have a local extremum at c

inflection point
      if f is continuous at c and f changes concavity at c, the point (c, f (c)) is an
      inflection point of f

second derivative test
      suppose f  (c) = 0 and f is continuous over an interval containing c; if
      f (c) > 0, then f has a local minimum at c; if f (c) < 0, then f has a
      local maximum at c; if f (c) = 0, then the test is inconclusive
Limits at Infinity and Asymptotes

      Calculate the limit of a function as x increases or decreases without bound.
      Recognize a horizontal asymptote on the graph of a function.
      Estimate the end behavior of a function as x increases or decreases without bound.
      Recognize an oblique asymptote on the graph of a function.
      Analyze a function and its derivatives to draw its graph.

We have shown how to use the first and second derivatives of a function to describe the shape
of a graph. To graph a function f defined on an unbounded domain, we also need to know the
behavior of f as x  ±. In this section, we define limits at infinity and show how these
limits affect the graph of a function. At the end of this section, we outline a strategy for
graphing an arbitrary function f.

Limits at Infinity

We begin by examining what it means for a function to have a finite limit at infinity. Then we
study the idea of a function with an infinite limit at infinity. Back in Introduction to Functions
and Graphs, we looked at vertical asymptotes; in this section we deal with horizontal and
oblique asymptotes.

Limits at Infinity and Horizontal Asymptotes

Recall that limf (x) = L means f (x) becomes arbitrarily close to L as long as x is

                                     xa

sufficiently close to a. We can extend this idea to limits at infinity. For example, consider the

function f (x)  =  2+  1  .  As  can  be  seen  graphically  in  [link]  and  numerically  in  [link],  as  the
                       x

values of x get larger, the values of f (x) approach 2. We say the limit as x approaches  of

f (x) is 2 and write lim f (x) = 2. Similarly, for x < 0, as the values |x| get larger, the

                                                                  x

values of f (x) approaches 2. We say the limit as x approaches - of f(x) is 2 and write

lim f (x) = 2.

Values of a function f as x  ±

More generally, for any function f, we say the limit as x   of f (x) is L if f (x) becomes
arbitrarily close to L as long as x is sufficiently large. In that case, we write lim f (x) = L.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            x

Similarly, we say the limit as x  - of f (x) is L if f (x) becomes arbitrarily close to L
as long as x < 0 and |x| is sufficiently large. In that case, we write lim f (x) = L. We now

                                                                                                                                                                                                                               x-

(Informal) If the values of f (x) become arbitrarily close to L as x becomes sufficiently
large, we say the function f has a limit at infinity and write
Equation:

If the values of f (x) becomes arbitrarily close to L for x < 0 as |x| becomes sufficiently
large, we say that the function f has a limit at negative infinity and write
Equation:

                                                                                           lim f (x) = L.

If the values f (x) are getting arbitrarily close to some finite value L as x   or

x  -, the graph of f approaches the line y = L. In that case, the line y = L is a

horizontal asymptote of f ([link]). For example, for the function f (x) =  1 , since

                                                                           x

lim f (x) = 0, the line y = 0 is a horizontal asymptote of f (x) = x 1 .

    (a) As x  , the values of f are getting arbitrarily close to L. The line y = L is a

                        to M. The line y = M is a horizontal asymptote of f.

A function cannot cross a vertical asymptote because the graph must approach infinity (or
-) from at least one direction as x approaches the vertical asymptote. However, a function
may cross a horizontal asymptote. In fact, a function may cross a horizontal asymptote an

intersects the horizontal asymptote y = 1 an infinite number of times as it oscillates around
the asymptote with ever-decreasing amplitude.

The graph of f (x) = (cos x)/x + 1 crosses its horizontal
       asymptote y = 1 an infinite number of times.

The algebraic limit laws and squeeze theorem we introduced in Introduction to Limits also
apply to limits at infinity. We illustrate how to use these laws to compute several limits at
infinity.

   Problem:
   Computing Limits at Infinity

For each of the following functions f, evaluate lim f (x) and lim f (x). Determine

                                                        x  x-

the horizontal asymptote(s) for f.

a. f (x) = 5 - 2 2

                                          x

c. f (x) = tan-1 (x)

Solution:

a. Using the algebraic limit laws, we have

            2                                    1                  1

x                 x

Similarly,  lim  f (x) = 5. Therefore, f (x) = 5 -                         2                  has a horizontal asymptote
                                                                          x2

           This function approaches a horizontal asymptote as

                                             x               x         x

for all x  0. Also, since
Equation:

                                                         -1                                1
                                              lim            = 0 = lim ,
                                             x x
                                                                              x x

we can apply the squeeze theorem to conclude that
Equation:

                                              sin x     = 0.

                                  x x

Similarly,
Equation:

                                                 sin x  = 0.

Infinite Limits at Infinity

Sometimes the values of a function f become arbitrarily large as x   (or as x  -).

In this case, we write lim f (x) =  (or lim f (x) = ). On the other hand, if the values

                       x                                               x-

of f are negative but become arbitrarily large in magnitude as x   (or as x  -), we

write lim f (x) = - (or lim f (x) = -).

      x                                            x-

For  example,  consider  the                       function  f    (x)  =      3  As  seen  in  [link]  and  [link],  as  x                                           the

define infinite limits as x  -.

Formal Definitions
Earlier, we used the terms arbitrarily close, arbitrarily large, and sufficiently large to define
limits at infinity informally. Although these terms provide accurate descriptions of limits at
infinity, they are not precise mathematically. Here are more formal definitions of limits at
infinity. We then look at how to use these definitions to prove results involving limits at
infinity.

End Behavior

The behavior of a function as x  ± is called the function's end behavior. At each of the
function's ends, the function could exhibit one of the following types of behavior:

   1. The function f (x) approaches a horizontal asymptote y = L.
   2. The function f (x)   or f (x)  -.
   3. The function does not approach a finite limit, nor does it approach  or -. In this

      case, the function may have some oscillatory behavior.

Let's consider several classes of functions here and look at the different types of end
behaviors for these functions.

End Behavior for Polynomial Functions

Consider the power function f (x) = xn where n is a positive integer. From [link] and [link],
we see that
Equation:

                                                                                                                               n

                                                                            lim x = ; n = 1, 2, 3,...

                                                                                                           x

and
Equation:

               n  ; n = 2, 4, 6,...

           lim x = {                  .

           x-     -; n = 1, 3, 5,...
For power functions with an even power of n,

      n      n
   lim x =  = lim x .

For power functions with an odd power of n,

lim xn =  and lim xn = -.

Using these facts, it is not difficult to evaluate lim cxn and lim cxn, where c is any

                                                                x                  x-

constant  and  n   is  a  positive     integer.   If  c  >  0,  the  graph  of  y  =          n  is     a  vertical  stretch  or

                                                                                      cx

                          x,

                          lim cx = lim x and lim cx = lim x if c > 0.

If c < 0, the graph of y = cxn is a vertical stretch or compression combined with a reflection
about the x-axis, and therefore
Equation:

                                 n                    n                n                         n

If c = 0, y = cxn = 0, in which case lim cxn = 0 = lim cxn.

                                                      x                    x-

End Behavior for Algebraic Functions

The end behavior for rational functions and functions involving radicals is a little more
complicated than for polynomials. In [link], we show that the limits at infinity of a rational

                                                            p(x)

function f (x) = q(x) depend on the relationship between the degree of the numerator and
the degree of the denominator. To evaluate the limits at infinity for a rational function, we
divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of x appearing in the
denominator. This determines which term in the overall expression dominates the behavior of
the function at large values of x.

Example:

   Problem:
   Determining End Behavior for Rational Functions

For each of the following functions, determine the limits as x   and x  -.
Then, use this information to describe the end behavior of the function.

a. f (x) =  3x-1  (Note: The degree of the numerator and the denominator are the
            2x+5

same.)

b. f (x) = 4x3-5x+7 3x2+2x (Note: The degree of numerator is less than the degree of the

denominator.)

c. f (x) = x+2 3x2+4x (Note: The degree of numerator is greater than the degree of the

denominator.)

Solution:

a. The highest power of x in the denominator is x. Therefore, dividing the numerator
  and denominator by x and applying the algebraic limit laws, we see that

Since      lim  f (x) =  3  ,  we  know  that              y  =  3  is a horizontal asymptote for this
                         2                                       2

     The graph of this rational function
    approaches a horizontal asymptote as

                                                                            x,

    numerator and denominator by x3. After doing so and applying algebraic limit

    laws, we obtain

    Equation:

    lim                         = lim                      =                                    = 0.

    Therefore f has a horizontal asymptote of y = 0 as shown in the following graph.
The graph of this rational function approaches
the horizontal asymptote y = 0 as x  ±.

c. Dividing the numerator and denominator by x, we have
  Equation:

                                  2             3x + 4

                  3x + 4x            = lim               .
     lim
   x± x + 2                          x± 1 + 2/x

As x  ±, the denominator approaches 1. As x  , the numerator

approaches +. As x  -, the numerator approaches -. Therefore

lim f (x) = , whereas lim f (x) = - as shown in the following figure.

                                                                                                                                                                        (3x2+4x)

Before proceeding, consider the graph of f (x) = (x+2) shown in [link]. As x   and

x  -, the graph of f appears almost linear. Although f is certainly not a linear function,
we now investigate why the graph of f seems to be approaching a linear function. First, using
long division of polynomials, we can write
Equation:

f (x) =                       3x2 + 4x  = 3x - 2 +       4
                                  x+2                              .

                                                    x+2

Since 4  0 as x  ±, we conclude that
                      (x+2)

Equation:

                                                    4

lim (f (x) - (3x - 2)) = lim                           = 0.

x±                                      x± x + 2

Therefore, the graph of f approaches the line y = 3x - 2 as x  ±. This line is known as
an oblique asymptote for f ([link]).

   The graph of the rational
             function

f (x) = (3x2 + 4x)/ (x + 2)

    approaches the oblique
            asymptote

     y = 3x - 2 as x  ±.
We can summarize the results of [link] to make the following conclusion regarding end
behavior for rational functions. Consider a rational function
Equation:

         p (x)           n      n-1  + ... + a1x + a0
                   anx + an-1x

f (x) =         =                                          ,

         q (x)           m      m-1  + ... + b1x + b0
                   bmx + bm-1x

where an  0 and bm  0.

   1. If the degree of the numerator is the same as the degree of the denominator (n = m),
      then f has a horizontal asymptote of y = an/bm as x  ±.

   2. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator (n < m), then
      f has a horizontal asymptote of y = 0 as x  ±.

   3. If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator (n > m),
      then f does not have a horizontal asymptote. The limits at infinity are either positive or
      negative infinity, depending on the signs of the leading terms. In addition, using long
      division, the function can be rewritten as
      Equation:

                f (x) =  p (x)  = g (x) +  r (x)
                         q (x)                          ,

                                           q (x)

where the degree of r (x) is less than the degree of q (x). As a result,

 lim r (x)/q (x) = 0. Therefore, the values of [f (x) - g (x)] approach zero as

x±

x  ±. If the degree of p (x) is exactly one more than the degree of q (x)
(n = m + 1), the function g (x) is a linear function. In this case, we call g (x) an

oblique asymptote.
Now let's consider the end behavior for functions involving a radical.

   behavior of f.

   Solution:
Let's use the same strategy as we did for rational functions: divide the numerator and
denominator by a power of x. To determine the appropriate power of x, consider the
expression 4x2 + 5 in the denominator. Since
Equation:

                                                                     4x2 + 5  4x2 = 2 |x|

for large values of x in effect x appears just to the first power in the denominator.
Therefore, we divide the numerator and denominator by |x|. Then, using the fact that

|x| = x for x > 0, |x| = -x for x < 0, and |x| = x2 for all x, we calculate the
limits as follows:
Equation:

                                      3x-2  =                    (1/|x|)(3x-2)

                                            =                         (1/|x|)(3x-2)

                                                 lim

                                               x- (1/x2)(4x2+5)

                                                                                     4

Therefore, f (x) approaches the horizontal asymptote y =                              3  as x   and the
                                                                                      2

horizontal  asymptote  y  =  -  3  as x  - as shown in the following graph.

This function has two horizontal asymptotes and it crosses one of
                              the asymptotes.

Determining End Behavior for Transcendental Functions
The six basic trigonometric functions are periodic and do not approach a finite limit as
x  ±. For example, sin x oscillates between 1 and -1 ([link]). The tangent function x
has an infinite number of vertical asymptotes as x  ±; therefore, it does not approach a
finite limit nor does it approach ± as x  ± as shown in [link].

Guidelines for Drawing the Graph of a Function

We now have enough analytical tools to draw graphs of a wide variety of algebraic and
transcendental functions. Before showing how to graph specific functions, let's look at a
general strategy to use when graphing any function.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Drawing the Graph of a Function
Given a function f, use the following steps to sketch a graph of f:

1. Determine the domain of the function.

2. Locate the x- and y-intercepts.

3. Evaluate lim f (x) and lim f (x) to determine the end behavior. If either of these

           x        x-

      limits is a finite number L, then y = L is a horizontal asymptote. If either of these

      limits is  or -, determine whether f has an oblique asymptote. If f is a rational

                                                                                                  p(x)

      function such that f (x) = q(x) , where the degree of the numerator is greater than the

      degree of the denominator, then f can be written as

      Equation:
f (x) =  p (x)                                   = g (x) +  r (x)
         q (x)                                                           ,

                                                            q (x)

  where the degree of r (x) is less than the degree of q (x). The values of f (x) approach
  the values of g (x) as x  ±. If g (x) is a linear function, it is known as an oblique
  asymptote.
4. Determine whether f has any vertical asymptotes.
5. Calculate f . Find all critical points and determine the intervals where f is increasing
  and where f is decreasing. Determine whether f has any local extrema.
6. Calculate f. Determine the intervals where f is concave up and where f is concave
  down. Use this information to determine whether f has any inflection points. The
  second derivative can also be used as an alternate means to determine or verify that f
  has a local extremum at a critical point.

Now let's use this strategy to graph several different functions. We start by graphing a
polynomial function.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Sketching a Graph of a Polynomial

   Sketch a graph of f (x) = (x - 1) (x + 2). 2

Solution:
Step 1. Since f is a polynomial, the domain is the set of all real numbers.

Step 2. When x = 0, f (x) = 2. Therefore, the y-intercept is (0, 2). To find the x-
intercepts, we need to solve the equation (x - 1) (x + 2) = 0, 2 gives us the x-
intercepts (1, 0) and (-2, 0)

Step 3. We need to evaluate the end behavior of f. As x  , (x - 1)   2 and

(x + 2)  . Therefore, lim f (x) = . As x  -, (x - 1)   2 and

                                                                                         x

(x + 2)  -. Therefore, lim f (x) = -. To get even more information about

                                                                                               x-

the end behavior of f, we can multiply the factors of f. When doing so, we see that
Equation:

         2                                       3

f (x) = (x - 1) (x + 2) = x - 3x + 2.
Since the leading term of f is x3, we conclude that f behaves like y = x3 as x  ±.

Step 4. Since f is a polynomial function, it does not have any vertical asymptotes.

Step 5. The first derivative of f is
Equation:

                                        2
                                      f (x) = 3x - 3.

Therefore, f has two critical points: x = 1, -1. Divide the interval (-, ) into the
three smaller intervals: (-, -1), (-1, 1), and (1, ). Then, choose test points
x = -2, x = 0, and x = 2 from these intervals and evaluate the sign of f  (x) at each
of these test points, as shown in the following table.

Interval  Test    Sign of Derivative                        Conclusion
          Point

(-1, 1)   x = -2                                            increasing.

          x=0     (+) (-) (-) = +                           f is
                                                            decreasing.
          x=2     (+) (-) (+) = -
                                                            f is
                  (+) (+) (+) = +                           increasing.

From the table, we see that f has a local maximum at x = -1 and a local minimum at
x = 1. Evaluating f (x) at those two points, we find that the local maximum value is
f (-1) = 4 and the local minimum value is f (1) = 0.

Step 6. The second derivative of f is
Equation:

                                                                                       f  (x) = 6x.

The second derivative is zero at x = 0. Therefore, to determine the concavity of f,
divide the interval (-, ) into the smaller intervals (-, 0) and (0, ), and
choose test points x = -1 and x = 1 to determine the concavity of f on each of these
smaller intervals as shown in the following table.

Interval   Test Point  Sign of f (x) = 6x  Conclusion
                                           f is concave down.
(-, 0)     x = -1      -                   f is concave up.
(0, )      x=1         +

We note that the information in the preceding table confirms the fact, found in step 5,
that f has a local maximum at x = -1 and a local minimum at x = 1. In addition, the
information found in step 5--namely, f has a local maximum at x = -1 and a local
minimum at x = 1, and f  (x) = 0 at those points--combined with the fact that f
changes sign only at x = 0 confirms the results found in step 6 on the concavity of f.

Combining this information, we arrive at the graph of f (x) = (x - 1) (x + 2) 2 shown
in the following graph.

Hint
f is a fourth-degree polynomial.
Example:

   Problem:
   Sketching a Rational Function
Sketch the graph of f (x) = (1-x2) . x2

Solution:

Step 1. The function f is defined as long as the denominator is not zero. Therefore, the
domain is the set of all real numbers x except x = ±1.

Step 2. Find the intercepts. If x = 0, then f (x) = 0, so 0 is an intercept. If y = 0, then
(1-x2) x = 0, 2 which implies x = 0. Therefore, (0, 0) is the only intercept.

Step 3. Evaluate the limits at infinity. Since f is a rational function, divide the

numerator  and  denominator  by  the       highest     power        in  the  denominator:                    2   We  obtain

                                                                                                         x.

Equation:

                                                    2  = lim             1   = -1.

                                       x                        x±   1

                    lim                                               2 -1
                  x± 1 - x2
                                                                    x

Therefore, f has a horizontal asymptote of y = -1 as x   and x  -.

Step 4. To determine whether f has any vertical asymptotes, first check to see whether

the denominator has any zeroes. We find the denominator is zero when x = ±1. To

determine whether the lines x = 1 or x = -1 are vertical asymptotes of f, evaluate

limf (x) and lim f (x). By looking at each one-sided limit as x  1, we see that

x1         x-1

Equation:

                                   x2                                                     x2  = .

                   lim                     = - and lim

In addition, by looking at each one-sided limit as x  -1, we find that
Equation:

                                       x2                                               x2    = -.

                     lim                   =  and lim
                  x-1+ 1 - x2                                      x-1- 1 - x2

Step 5. Calculate the first derivative:
Equation:

                         (1 - x2) (2x) - x2 (-2x)                                             2x
                                                                                                              .
                
                f (x) =                                                      =

                                           (1 - x2 2 )                                      (1 - x2 2 )
Critical points occur at points x where f  (x) = 0 or f  (x) is undefined. We see that

f  (x) = 0 when x = 0. The derivative f  is not undefined at any point in the domain of

f. However, x = ±1 are not in the domain of f. Therefore, to determine where f is

increasing and where f is decreasing, divide the interval (-, ) into four smaller

intervals: (-, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, ), and choose a test point in each

interval to determine the sign of f  (x) in each of these intervals. The values x = -2,

                         1  1  ,  and  x  =  2  are  good  choices     for   test  points                                  as  shown  in  the  following

(-1, 0)                           x = -1/2              -/+ = -                                                                f is increasing.
(0, 1)                            x = 1/2               -/+ = -                                                                f is increasing.

                                                        +/+ = +

From this analysis, we conclude that f has a local minimum at x = 0 but no local
maximum.

Step 6. Calculate the second derivative:
Equation:

                                          f  (x)     =                     22 2

                                                        (1-x ) (2)-2x(2(1-x )(-2x))
                                                                                       (1-x2 4 )

                                                           2              2  2
                                                        (1-x )[2(1-x )+8x ]

                                                     =           (1-x2 4 )

                                                              2        2
                                                        2(1-x )+8x

                                                     =     (1-x2 3 )

                                                     =   6x2+2

                                                                 2 3.

                                                        (1-x )

To determine the intervals where f is concave up and where f is concave down, we first
need to find all points x where f (x) = 0 or f (x) is undefined. Since the numerator
6x2 + 2  0 for any x, f (x) is never zero. Furthermore, f is not undefined for any
x in the domain of f. However, as discussed earlier, x = ±1 are not in the domain of f.
Therefore, to determine the concavity of f, we divide the interval (-, ) into the
three smaller intervals (-, -1), (-1, -1), and (1, ), and choose a test point in
each of these intervals to evaluate the sign of f (x). in each of these intervals. The
values x = -2, x = 0, and x = 2 are possible test points as shown in the following
table.

           Point                           f is concave down.
(-, -1)            f  (x) =   6x +2        f is concave up.

           x=2     +/+ = +

                   +/- = -

Combining all this information, we arrive at the graph of f shown below. Note that,
although f changes concavity at x = -1 and x = 1, there are no inflection points at
either of these places because f is not continuous at x = -1 or x = 1.

Hint
A line y = L is a horizontal asymptote of f if the limit as x   or the limit as x  -

as x  a is  or -.

   Solution:
   Step 1. The domain of f is the set of all real numbers x except x = 1.
Step 2. Find the intercepts. We can see that when x = 0, f (x) = 0, so (0, 0) is the only
intercept.

Step 3. Evaluate the limits at infinity. Since the degree of the numerator is one more
than the degree of the denominator, f must have an oblique asymptote. To find the
oblique asymptote, use long division of polynomials to write
Equation:

                    f (x) =                                2  = x+1+            1
                                                                                          .
                                                     x
                                                 x-1                       x-1

Since 1/ (x - 1)  0 as x  ±, f (x) approaches the line y = x + 1 as x  ±.
The line y = x + 1 is an oblique asymptote for f.

Step 4. To check for vertical asymptotes, look at where the denominator is zero. Here
the denominator is zero at x = 1. Looking at both one-sided limits as x  1, we find
Equation:

                                              2                                                                 2  = -.

                                  x                                                       x
                   lim                           =  and lim
                  x1+ x - 1
                                                                         x1- x - 1

Therefore, x = 1 is a vertical asymptote, and we have determined the behavior of f as
x approaches 1 from the right and the left.

Step 5. Calculate the first derivative:
Equation:

                           (x - 1) (2x) - x2 (1)                                                                       2

                                                                                                                   x - 2x

                  f (x) =                                                  =                                                .

                                                                 2                                                       2

                                                 (x - 1)                                                           (x - 1)

We have f  (x) = 0 when x2 - 2x = x (x - 2) = 0. Therefore, x = 0 and x = 2 are

critical points. Since f is undefined at x = 1, we need to divide the interval (-, )

into the smaller intervals (-, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), and (2, ), and choose a test point

from each interval to evaluate the sign of f  (x) in each of these smaller intervals. For

example, let x = -1, x =  1                      3  ,  and    x  =  3  be  the                                     test  points  as  shown  in  the

                                                                                                      decreasing.

                                                                                                      f is

From this table, we see that f has a local maximum at x = 0 and a local minimum at
x = 2. The value of f at the local maximum is f (0) = 0 and the value of f at the local
minimum is f (2) = 4. Therefore, (0, 0) and (2, 4) are important points on the graph.

Step 6. Calculate the second derivative:
Equation:

                                          2                              2

                            (x-1) (2x-2)-(x -2x)(2(x-1))

                 f  (x)  =                                         4

                                             (x-1)

                         =  (x-1)[(x-1)(2x-2)-2(x2-2x)]

                                                                                                  4

                                                             (x-1)

                         =  (x-1)(2x-2)-2(x2-2x)

                                                                                   3

                                                   (x-1)

                         =  2x2-4x+2-(2x2-4x)

                                                                              3

                                               (x-1)

                         =         2

                                       3.

                            (x-1)

We see that f (x) is never zero or undefined for x in the domain of f. Since f is
undefined at x = 1, to check concavity we just divide the interval (-, ) into the
two smaller intervals (-, 1) and (1, ), and choose a test point from each interval to
evaluate the sign of f (x) in each of these intervals. The values x = 0 and x = 2 are
possible test points as shown in the following table.

                                                                                                                                                                                             f is concave down.

From the information gathered, we arrive at the following graph for f.

Hint
Use long division of polynomials.

Example:
Exercise:
Problem:
Sketching the Graph of a Function with a Cusp

Sketch a graph of f (x) = (x - 1) . 2/3

Solution:

Step 1. Since the cube-root function is defined for all real numbers x and

                          2

          2/3
(x - 1) = (x - 1) , the domain of f is all real numbers.3

Step 2: To find the y-intercept, evaluate f (0). Since f (0) = 1, the y-intercept is (0, 1).
To find the x-intercept, solve (x - 1) = 0. 2/3 The solution of this equation is x = 1, so
the x-intercept is (1, 0).

Step 3: Since lim (x - 1) = , 2/3 the function continues to grow without bound as

                                             x±

x   and x  -.

Step 4: The function has no vertical asymptotes.

Step  5:  To   determine  where  f  is  increasing  or  decreasing,  calculate                       We  find

                                                                                              f.

Equation:

                                        2 -1/3                         2

                          f (x) =          (x - 1)      =                               .

                                        3                                                1/3

                                                           3(x - 1)

This function is not zero anywhere, but it is undefined when x = 1. Therefore, the only
critical point is x = 1. Divide the interval (-, ) into the smaller intervals (-, 1)
and (1, ), and choose test points in each of these intervals to determine the sign of
f  (x) in each of these smaller intervals. Let x = 0 and x = 2 be the test points as
shown in the following table.

Interval          Test Point               Sign of f  (x) =  2                                Conclusion
                                                                                              f is decreasing.
(-, 1)            x=0                                                   1/3                   f is increasing.
(1, )             x=2
                                                             3(x-1)

                                           +/- = -
                                           +/+ = +
We conclude that f has a local minimum at x = 1. Evaluating f at x = 1, we find that
the value of f at the local minimum is zero. Note that f  (1) is undefined, so to
determine the behavior of the function at this critical point, we need to examine
limf  (x). Looking at the one-sided limits, we have

x1

Equation:

               2                                    2

          lim                      =  and lim                               = -.

          x1+         1/3                   x1-                        1/3

               3(x - 1)                          3(x - 1)

Therefore, f has a cusp at x = 1.

Step 6: To determine concavity, we calculate the second derivative of f:
Equation:

                                   2 -4/3                     -2

               f  (x) = - (x - 1)           =                                    .

                                   9                                              4/3

                                                    9(x - 1)

We find that f (x) is defined for all x, but is undefined when x = 1. Therefore, divide
the interval (-, ) into the smaller intervals (-, 1) and (1, ), and choose test
points to evaluate the sign of f (x) in each of these intervals. As we did earlier, let
x = 0 and x = 2 be test points as shown in the following table.

Interval  Test Point               Sign of f (x) =  -2                      Conclusion
                                                                            f is concave down.
(-, 1)    x=0                                                     4/3       f is concave down.
(1, )     x=2
                                                    9(x-1)

                                   -/+ = -

                                   -/+ = -

From this table, we conclude that f is concave down everywhere. Combining all of this
information, we arrive at the following graph for f.

                                            x.

is located. Determine the end behavior of f.

behavior, lim f (x) = -.

                                x±

Hint

A function f has a cusp at a point a if f (a) exists, f(a) is undefined, one of the one-sided
limits as x  a of f(x) is +, and the other one-sided limit is -.

Key Concepts

The limit of f (x) is L as x   (or as x  -) if the values f (x) become

arbitrarily close to L as x becomes sufficiently large.

The limit of f (x) is  as x   if f (x) becomes arbitrarily large as x becomes

sufficiently large. The limit of f (x) is - as x   if f (x) < 0 and |f (x)| becomes

arbitrarily large as x becomes sufficiently large. We can define the limit of f (x) as x

approaches - similarly.

For a polynomial function p (x) = anxn + an-1xn-1 + ... + a1x + a0, where an  0,

the   end    behavior  is  determined    by  the  leading  term               n  If  n     0,  p  (x)  approaches  

                                                                 anx .
or - at each end.

                                                                                                           p(x)

For a rational function f (x) = q(x) , the end behavior is determined by the relationship

between the degree of p and the degree of q. If the degree of p is less than the degree of

q, the line y = 0 is a horizontal asymptote for f. If the degree of p is equal to the degree

of q, then the line y =  an  is a horizontal asymptote, where an and bn are the leading
                         b
                         n

coefficients of p and q, respectively. If the degree of p is greater than the degree of q,

then f approaches  or - at each end.

Applied Optimization Problems

      Set up and solve optimization problems in several applied fields.

One common application of calculus is calculating the minimum or maximum
value of a function. For example, companies often want to minimize production
costs or maximize revenue. In manufacturing, it is often desirable to minimize
the amount of material used to package a product with a certain volume. In this
section, we show how to set up these types of minimization and maximization
problems and solve them by using the tools developed in this chapter.

Solving Optimization Problems over a Closed, Bounded Interval

The basic idea of the optimization problems that follow is the same. We have a
particular quantity that we are interested in maximizing or minimizing. However,
we also have some auxiliary condition that needs to be satisfied. For example, in
[link], we are interested in maximizing the area of a rectangular garden.
Certainly, if we keep making the side lengths of the garden larger, the area will
continue to become larger. However, what if we have some restriction on how
much fencing we can use for the perimeter? In this case, we cannot make the
garden as large as we like. Let's look at how we can maximize the area of a
rectangle subject to some constraint on the perimeter.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Maximizing the Area of a Garden

   A rectangular garden is to be constructed using a rock wall as one side of
   the garden and wire fencing for the other three sides ([link]). Given 100 ft
   of wire fencing, determine the dimensions that would create a garden of
   maximum area. What is the maximum area?
     We want to determine the measurements x and y
   that will create a garden with a maximum area using

                        100 ft of fencing.

Solution:

Let x denote the length of the side of the garden perpendicular to the rock
wall and y denote the length of the side parallel to the rock wall. Then the
area of the garden is
Equation:

                                                                            A = x  y.

We want to find the maximum possible area subject to the constraint that
the total fencing is 100 ft. From [link], the total amount of fencing used
will be 2x + y. Therefore, the constraint equation is
Equation:

                                                                      2x + y = 100.
Solving this equation for y, we have y = 100 - 2x. Thus, we can write the
area as
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                           2

                                        A (x) = x  (100 - 2x) = 100x - 2x .

Before  trying  to  maximize          the  area  function  A  (x)  =    100x     -           2  we  need

                                                                                    2x ,

to determine the domain under consideration. To construct a rectangular

garden, we certainly need the lengths of both sides to be positive.

Therefore, we need x > 0 and y > 0. Since y = 100 - 2x, if y > 0, then

x < 50. Therefore, we are trying to determine the maximum value of A (x)

for x over the open interval (0, 50). We do not know that a function

necessarily has a maximum value over an open interval. However, we do

know that a continuous function has an absolute maximum (and absolute

minimum) over a closed interval. Therefore, let's consider the function

A  (x)  =  100x  -           2  over  the  closed  interval  [0,  50].  If  the  maximum

                    2x

value occurs at an interior point, then we have found the value x in the

open interval (0, 50) that maximizes the area of the garden. Therefore, we

consider the following problem:

Maximize A (x) = 100x - 2x2 over the interval [0, 50].

As mentioned earlier, since A is a continuous function on a closed,
bounded interval, by the extreme value theorem, it has a maximum and a
minimum. These extreme values occur either at endpoints or critical points.
At the endpoints, A (x) = 0. Since the area is positive for all x in the open
interval (0, 50), the maximum must occur at a critical point. Differentiating
the function A (x), we obtain
Equation:

                                            

                                      A (x) = 100 - 4x.

Therefore, the only critical point is x = 25 ([link]). We conclude that the
maximum area must occur when x = 25. Then we have
y = 100 - 2x = 100 - 2 (25) = 50. To maximize the area of the garden,
let x = 25 ft and y = 50 ft. The area of this garden is 1250 ft . 2
    To maximize the area of the garden, we need to find the

           maximum  value     of  the  function  A  (x)  =  100x  -                 2

                                                                           2x .

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem:

Determine the maximum area if we want to make the same rectangular
garden as in [link], but we have 200 ft of fencing.

Solution:

   The maximum area is 5000 ft . 2
Hint

We  need   to  maximize  the  function  A  (x)   =  200x    -           2  over  the   interval

                                                               2x

[0, 100].
Now let's look at a general strategy for solving optimization problems similar to
[link].

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving Optimization Problems

   1. Introduce all variables. If applicable, draw a figure and label all variables.
   2. Determine which quantity is to be maximized or minimized, and for what

      range of values of the other variables (if this can be determined at this
      time).
   3. Write a formula for the quantity to be maximized or minimized in terms of
      the variables. This formula may involve more than one variable.
   4. Write any equations relating the independent variables in the formula from
      step 3. Use these equations to write the quantity to be maximized or
      minimized as a function of one variable.
   5. Identify the domain of consideration for the function in step 4 based on the
      physical problem to be solved.
   6. Locate the maximum or minimum value of the function from step 4. This
      step typically involves looking for critical points and evaluating a function
      at endpoints.

Now let's apply this strategy to maximize the volume of an open-top box given a
constraint on the amount of material to be used.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Maximizing the Volume of a Box

   An open-top box is to be made from a 24 in. by 36 in. piece of cardboard
   by removing a square from each corner of the box and folding up the flaps
   on each side. What size square should be cut out of each corner to get a box
   with the maximum volume?
Solution:

Step 1: Let x be the side length of the square to be removed from each
corner ([link]). Then, the remaining four flaps can be folded up to form an
open-top box. Let V be the volume of the resulting box.

A square with side length x inches is removed from each corner of
the piece of cardboard. The remaining flaps are folded to form an

                                open-top box.

Step 2: We are trying to maximize the volume of a box. Therefore, the
problem is to maximize V .

Step 3: As mentioned in step 2, are trying to maximize the volume of a box.
The volume of a box is V = L  W  H, where L, W , and H are the
length, width, and height, respectively.

Step 4: From [link], we see that the height of the box is x inches, the length
is 36 - 2x inches, and the width is 24 - 2x inches. Therefore, the volume
of the box is
Equation:

3  2
V (x) = (36 - 2x) (24 - 2x)x = 4x - 120x + 864x.
Step 5: To determine the domain of consideration, let's examine [link].
Certainly, we need x > 0. Furthermore, the side length of the square cannot
be greater than or equal to half the length of the shorter side, 24 in.;
otherwise, one of the flaps would be completely cut off. Therefore, we are
trying to determine whether there is a maximum volume of the box for x
over the open interval (0, 12). Since V is a continuous function over the
closed interval [0, 12], we know V will have an absolute maximum over
the closed interval. Therefore, we consider V over the closed interval
[0, 12] and check whether the absolute maximum occurs at an interior

point.

Step 6: Since V (x) is a continuous function over the closed, bounded
interval [0, 12], V must have an absolute maximum (and an absolute
minimum). Since V (x) = 0 at the endpoints and V (x) > 0 for
0 < x < 12, the maximum must occur at a critical point. The derivative is
Equation:

                                                    2
       V (x) = 12x - 240x + 864.

To find the critical points, we need to solve the equation
Equation:

                                                                                               2

                                                          12x - 240x + 864 = 0.

Dividing both sides of this equation by 12, the problem simplifies to
solving the equation
Equation:

                                                                                               2

                                                                x - 20x + 72 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, we find that the critical points are
Equation:

                                                 2     20±112     20±47

    20±(-20) - 4 (1) (72)

x=                                                  =          =                                     = 10±27.

    2                                                  2                                          2
Since 10 + 27 is not in the domain of consideration, the only critical
point we need to consider is 10 - 27. Therefore, the volume is
maximized if we let x = 10 - 27 in. The maximum volume is

V  (10  -  27)  =  640  +  4487                                3  as  shown  in  the  following

                                   1825 in.

graph.

         Maximizing the volume of the box leads to finding the maximum
                               value of a cubic polynomial.

   Solution:

   Problem:
   Minimizing Travel Time

   An island is 2 mi due north of its closest point along a straight shoreline. A
   visitor is staying at a cabin on the shore that is 6 mi west of that point. The
   visitor is planning to go from the cabin to the island. Suppose the visitor
   runs at a rate of 8 mph and swims at a rate of 3 mph. How far should the
   visitor run before swimming to minimize the time it takes to reach the
   island?

   Solution:

   Step 1: Let x be the distance running and let y be the distance swimming
   ([link]). Let T be the time it takes to get from the cabin to the island.
How can we choose x and y to minimize the travel time from the
                           cabin to the island?

Step 2: The problem is to minimize T .

Step 3: To find the time spent traveling from the cabin to the island, add the
time spent running and the time spent swimming. Since Distance = Rate
× Time (D = R × T ), the time spent running is
Equation:

                                Drunning         x

Trunning =                                    =     ,

                                Rrunning         8

and the time spent swimming is
Equation:

                                Dswimming           y

Tswimming =                                   =.

                                Rswimming           3

Therefore, the total time spent traveling is
Equation:

                                                    x                                  y

                                           T=                                          +.

                                                    8                                  3

Step 4: From [link], the line segment of y miles forms the hypotenuse of a
right triangle with legs of length 2 mi and 6 - x mi. Therefore, by the
Pythagorean theorem, 22 + (6 - x) = y , 2 2 and we obtain

y  =  (6  -            2  +  4.  Thus,  the  total  time                               spent  traveling   is  given  by  the

               x)

function

                                                                                                 2

                                           x (6 - x) + 4

                                 T (x) =      +                                                     .

                                           8                                              3

Step 5: From [link], we see that 0  x  6. Therefore, [0, 6] is the domain
of consideration.

Step 6: Since T (x) is a continuous function over a closed, bounded
interval, it has a maximum and a minimum. Let's begin by looking for any
critical points of T over the interval [0, 6]. The derivative is
Equation:

    11                                                                           -1/2                  1             (6 - x)
                                                           2

                             [(6 - x) + 4]

T (x) =        -                                                                        2 (6 - x) =       -                      .

            8     2                     3                                                              8                      2

                                                                                                              3(6 - x) + 4

If T  (x) = 0, then
Equation:

                                 1                  6-x

                                        =                                                     .

                                 8                                                        2

                                             3(6 - x) + 4

Therefore,
Equation:

               3 2 (6 - x) + 4 = 8(6 - x).

Squaring both sides of this equation, we see that if x satisfies this equation,
then x must satisfy
Equation:

               2                                      2

               9 [(6 - x) + 4] = 64(6 - x) ,

which implies
Equation:

                                                 2

               55(6 - x) = 36.

We conclude that if x is a critical point, then x satisfies
Equation:

                                         2  36
                                                   .
               (x - 6) =
                                            55

Therefore, the possibilities for critical points are
Equation:

                       6

               x = 6±                       .

                       55

Since x = 6 + 6/55 is not in the domain, it is not a possibility for a
critical point. On the other hand, x = 6 - 6/55 is in the domain. Since
we squared both sides of [link] to arrive at the possible critical points, it
remains to verify that x = 6 - 6/55 satisfies [link]. Since
x = 6 - 6/55 does satisfy that equation, we conclude that
x = 6 - 6/55 is a critical point, and it is the only one. To justify that the
time is minimized for this value of x, we just need to check the values of
T (x) at the endpoints x = 0 and x = 6, and compare them with the value
of T (x) at the critical point x = 6 - 6/55. We find that
T (0)  2.108 h and T (6)  1.417 h, whereas

T (6 - 6/55)  1.368 h. Therefore, we conclude that T has a local

minimum at x  5.19 mi.

In business, companies are interested in maximizing revenue. In the following
example, we consider a scenario in which a company has collected data on how
many cars it is able to lease, depending on the price it charges its customers to
rent a car. Let's use these data to determine the price the company should charge
to maximize the amount of money it brings in.

Example:
Exercise:
Problem:
Maximizing Revenue

Owners of a car rental company have determined that if they charge
customers p dollars per day to rent a car, where 50  p  200, the number
of cars n they rent per day can be modeled by the linear function
n (p) = 1000 - 5p. If they charge $50 per day or less, they will rent all
their cars. If they charge $200 per day or more, they will not rent any cars.
Assuming the owners plan to charge customers between $50 per day and
$200 per day to rent a car, how much should they charge to maximize their
revenue?

Solution:

Step 1: Let p be the price charged per car per day and let n be the number
of cars rented per day. Let R be the revenue per day.

Step 2: The problem is to maximize R.

Step 3: The revenue (per day) is equal to the number of cars rented per day
times the price charged per car per day--that is, R = n × p.

Step 4: Since the number of cars rented per day is modeled by the linear
function n (p) = 1000 - 5p, the revenue R can be represented by the
function
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                2

                          R (p) = n × p = (1000 - 5p)p = -5p + 1000p.

Step 5: Since the owners plan to charge between $50 per car per day and
$200 per car per day, the problem is to find the maximum revenue R (p)
for p in the closed interval [50, 200].

Step 6: Since R is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval
[50, 200], it has an absolute maximum (and an absolute minimum) in that
interval. To find the maximum value, look for critical points. The derivative
is R (p) = -10p + 1000. Therefore, the critical point is p = 100 When
p = 100, R (100) = $50,000. When p = 50, R (p) = $37,500. When
p = 200, R (p) = $0. Therefore, the absolute maximum occurs at
   p = $100. The car rental company should charge $100 per day per car to
   maximize revenue as shown in the following figure.

          To maximize revenue, a car rental company has to
       balance the price of a rental against the number of cars

                       people will rent at that price.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   A car rental company charges its customers p dollars per day, where
   60  p  150. It has found that the number of cars rented per day can be
   modeled by the linear function n (p) = 750 - 5p. How much should the
   company charge each customer to maximize revenue?
   Solution:
   The company should charge $75 per car per day.
Hint
R (p) = n × p, where n is the number of cars rented and p is the price charged
per car.

   Problem:
   Maximizing the Area of an Inscribed Rectangle
   A rectangle is to be inscribed in the ellipse
   Equation:

                                                                               x2

                                                                                                                                        2

                                                                                       + y = 1.
                                                                                4

   What should the dimensions of the rectangle be to maximize its area? What
   is the maximum area?
   Solution:
   Step 1: For a rectangle to be inscribed in the ellipse, the sides of the
   rectangle must be parallel to the axes. Let L be the length of the rectangle
   and W be its width. Let A be the area of the rectangle.

          We want to maximize the area of a rectangle inscribed in an
                                          ellipse.
Step 2: The problem is to maximize A.

Step 3: The area of the rectangle is A = LW .

Step 4: Let (x, y) be the corner of the rectangle that lies in the first
quadrant, as shown in [link]. We can write length L = 2x and width
W = 2y. Since 2 x2 and y > 0, we have y = 4  1-x . 2 Therefore, the

                                                       4+y =1

area is
Equation:

A = LW                                                     1 - x2   = 2x4 - x2.
        = (2x) (2y) = 4x

                                                                 4

Step 5: From [link], we see that to inscribe a rectangle in the ellipse, the x-
coordinate of the corner in the first quadrant must satisfy 0 < x < 2.
Therefore, the problem reduces to looking for the maximum value of A (x)
over the open interval (0, 2). Since A (x) will have an absolute maximum
(and absolute minimum) over the closed interval [0, 2], we consider

A (x) = 2x4 - x2 over the interval [0, 2]. If the absolute maximum
occurs at an interior point, then we have found an absolute maximum in the
open interval.

Step 6: As mentioned earlier, A (x) is a continuous function over the
closed, bounded interval [0, 2]. Therefore, it has an absolute maximum (and
absolute minimum). At the endpoints x = 0 and x = 2, A (x) = 0. For
0 < x < 2, A (x) > 0. Therefore, the maximum must occur at a critical
point. Taking the derivative of A (x), we obtain
Equation:

A(x)    = 24 - x2 + 2x               1

                                            (-2x)

                            24-x2

        = 24 - x2 -             2x2
                            4-x2

        =   8-4x2

                         .

           4-x2
To find critical points, we need to find where A(x) = 0. We can see that if
x is a solution of
Equation:

                                        8 - 4x2   = 0,
                                       4 - x2

then x must satisfy
Equation:

                                                              2

                                       8 - 4x = 0.

Therefore,      2  =  2.  Thus,  x  =  ±2    are  the  possible        solutions  of  [link].

            x

Since we are considering x over the interval [0, 2], x = 2 is a possibility

for a critical point, but x = -2 is not. Therefore, we check whether 2

is a solution of [link]. Since x = 2 is a solution of [link], we conclude

that 2 is the only critical point of A (x) in the interval [0, 2]. Therefore,

A (x) must have an absolute maximum at the critical point x = 2. To
determine the dimensions of the rectangle, we need to find the length L and

the width W . If x = 2 then
Equation:

                                          2

                                     (2)                         1     1
                          1-                                                  .
                      y=                     = 1 -                  =

                                       4                         2     2

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are L = 2x = 22 and
W = 2y = 2 = 2. The area of this rectangle is

                                          2

A = LW = (22) (2) = 4.

Hint

If (x, y) is the vertex of the square that lies in the first quadrant, then the area of

Solving Optimization Problems when the Interval Is Not Closed or
Is Unbounded

In the previous examples, we considered functions on closed, bounded domains.
Consequently, by the extreme value theorem, we were guaranteed that the
functions had absolute extrema. Let's now consider functions for which the
domain is neither closed nor bounded.

Many functions still have at least one absolute extrema, even if the domain is not

closed  or  the  domain  is  unbounded.  For  example,  the  function  f  (x)  =      2  +  4

                                                                                  x

over (-, ) has an absolute minimum of 4 at x = 0. Therefore, we can still

consider functions over unbounded domains or open intervals and determine

whether they have any absolute extrema. In the next example, we try to minimize

a function over an unbounded domain. We will see that, although the domain of

consideration is (0, ), the function has an absolute minimum.

In the following example, we look at constructing a box of least surface area with
a prescribed volume. It is not difficult to show that for a closed-top box, by
symmetry, among all boxes with a specified volume, a cube will have the
smallest surface area. Consequently, we consider the modified problem of
determining which open-topped box with a specified volume has the smallest
surface area.

   Problem:
   Minimizing Surface Area

   A rectangular box with a square base, an open top, and a volume of 216 in.3
   is to be constructed. What should the dimensions of the box be to minimize
   the surface area of the box? What is the minimum surface area?

   Solution:

   Step 1: Draw a rectangular box and introduce the variable x to represent the
   length of each side of the square base; let y represent the height of the box.
   Let S denote the surface area of the open-top box.

   We want to
  minimize the
surface area of a
square-based box
   with a given

     volume.

Step 2: We need to minimize the surface area. Therefore, we need to
minimize S.

Step 3: Since the box has an open top, we need only determine the area of

the four vertical sides and the base. The area of each of the four vertical

sides  is  x    y.  The  area  of  the  base  is      2  Therefore,  the  surface  area  of  the

                                                  x.

box is

Equation:
                                                                                          2

                                             S = 4xy + x .

Step 4: Since the volume of this box is x2y and the volume is given as

216           3  ,  the  constraint  equation                             is

     in.

Equation:

                                                                              2

                                                                          x y = 216.

Solving the constraint equation for y, we have y = x2 . 216 Therefore, we can
write the surface area as a function of x only:
Equation:

                                                                                       216           2

                                     S (x) = 4x (                                             )+x .

                                                                                       x2

Therefore, S (x) = 864 + x2.
                                                                       x

Step  5:  Since          we  are  requiring                               that      2  =   216,  we     cannot  have  x  =  0.

                                                                                xy

Therefore, we need x > 0. On the other hand, x is allowed to have any

positive value. Note that as x becomes large, the height of the box y

becomes             correspondingly  small                                so    that       2  =  216.   Similarly,  as  x  becomes

                                                                                       xy

small, the height of the box becomes correspondingly large. We conclude

that the domain is the open, unbounded interval (0, ). Note that, unlike

the previous examples, we cannot reduce our problem to looking for an

absolute maximum or absolute minimum over a closed, bounded interval.

However, in the next step, we discover why this function must have an

absolute minimum over the interval (0, ).

Step 6: Note that as x  0+, S (x)  . Also, as x  , S (x)  .
Since S is a continuous function that approaches infinity at the ends, it
must have an absolute minimum at some x  (0, ). This minimum must
occur at a critical point of S. The derivative is

       We can use a graph to determine the dimensions of a
        box of given the volume and the minimum surface

                                    area.

   material for the sides is 30¢/in.2 and we are trying to minimize the cost of
   this box. Write the cost as a function of the side lengths of the base. (Let x
   be the side length of the base and y be the height of the box.)

L'Hôpital's Rule

      Recognize when to apply L'Hôpital's rule.
      Identify indeterminate forms produced by quotients, products, subtractions, and powers,
      and apply L'Hôpital's rule in each case.
      Describe the relative growth rates of functions.

In this section, we examine a powerful tool for evaluating limits. This tool, known as
L'Hôpital's rule, uses derivatives to calculate limits. With this rule, we will be able to evaluate
many limits we have not yet been able to determine. Instead of relying on numerical evidence to
conjecture that a limit exists, we will be able to show definitively that a limit exists and to
determine its exact value.

Applying L'Hôpital's Rule

L'Hôpital's rule can be used to evaluate limits involving the quotient of two functions. Consider
Equation:

                                                                 f (x)

                                                      lim               .

                                                     xa g (x)

If limf (x) = L1 and limg (x) = L2  0, then

xa         xa

Equation:

                                                      f (x)             L1

                                                 lim             =          .

                                                 xa g (x)               L2

However, what happens if limf (x) = 0 and limg (x) = 0? We call this one of the

                                 xa                   xa

indeterminate forms, of type         0  .  This  is  considered         an  indeterminate  form  because  we  cannot
                                     0

                                                                                                            f (x)

determine the exact behavior of g(x) as x  a without further analysis. We have seen examples

of this earlier in the text. For example, consider

Equation:

                                                              2             sin x

                                                     x -4        and lim           .
                                           lim
                                           x2 x - 2              x0 x

For the first of these examples, we can evaluate the limit by factoring the numerator and writing
Equation:

                              2            (x + 2) (x - 2)

                     x -4        = lim                           = lim (x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4.
           lim
           x2 x - 2              x2              x-2                      x2
For lim  sin x  we were able to show, using a geometric argument, that
            x
x0

Equation:

                                                 sin x  = 1.
                                       lim
                                       x0 x

Here we use a different technique for evaluating limits such as these. Not only does this
technique provide an easier way to evaluate these limits, but also, and more important, it
provides us with a way to evaluate many other limits that we could not calculate previously.

The idea behind L'Hôpital's rule can be explained using local linear approximations. Consider

two differentiable functions f and g such that limf (x) = 0 = limg (x) and such that

                                       xa                     xa

g (a)  0 For x near a, we can write

Equation:

                                                                              

                f (x)  f (a) + f (a) (x - a)

and
Equation:

                                                                           

                g (x)  g (a) + g (a)(x - a).

Therefore,
Equation:

                f (x)                  f (a) + f  (a) (x - a)

                                                                                .

                g (x)                  g (a) + g (a) (x - a)
If limf (x) = limg (x), then the ratio f (x)/g (x) is approximately

       xa              xa

            equal to the ratio of their linear approximations near a.

Since f is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a, and therefore f (a) = limf (x) = 0.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  xa

Similarly,  g  (a)  =  lim g  (x)  =   0.      If  we    also  assume  that          and        are  continuous    at  x  =  a,  then

                                                                              f           g

                       xa

f  (a) = limf  (x) and g (a) = limg (x). Using these ideas, we conclude that

            xa                           xa

Equation:

                                        f (x)                  f  (x) (x - a)                 f  (x)
                              lim
                              xa g (x)         = lim                           = lim                   .
                                                     xa g (x) (x - a)
                                                                                        xa g (x)

Note  that  the  assumption   that  f    and             are  continuous  at  a  and          (a)      0  can  be  loosened.     We

                                                   g                                    g

state L'Hôpital's rule formally for the indeterminate form                       0   .  Also    note   that  the  notation   0   does
                                                                                 0                                           0

not mean we are actually dividing zero by zero. Rather, we are using the notation                                  0   to represent
                                                                                                                   0

b. As x  1, the numerator sin (x)  0 and the denominator ln (x)  0. Therefore,
  we can apply L'Hôpital's rule. We obtain

                                                    = (  1) (-1) = -.

c. As x  , the numerator e1/x - 1  0 and the denominator ( 1 )  0. Therefore,

  we can apply L'Hôpital's rule. We obtain
  Equation:

                         1/x                        e1/x -1
                                                       ( 2)
                        e     -1                          x                              1/x  0

                   lim            = lim                             = lim e                   = e = 1.

                                                             x

d. As x  0, both the numerator and denominator approach zero. Therefore, we can
  apply L'Hôpital's rule. We obtain
  Equation:

                                   sin x - x                        cos x - 1

                              lim                      = lim                             .

                              x0   x2                     x0                         2x

Since the numerator and denominator of this new quotient both approach zero as
        x  0, we apply L'Hôpital's rule again. In doing so, we see that
        Equation:

                                                                             cos x - 1           -sin x

                                                                        lim              = lim            = 0.

                                                                        x0   2x              x0  2

        Therefore, we conclude that
        Equation:

                                                                                  sin x - x

                                                                             lim                 = 0.

                                                                             x0          x2

We can also use L'Hôpital's rule to evaluate limits of quotients g(x) in which f (x)  ± and
g (x)  ±. Limits of this form are classified as indeterminate forms of type /. Again,
note that we are not actually dividing  by . Since  is not a real number, that is impossible;
rather, /. is used to represent a quotient of limits, each of which is  or -.

Note:

L'Hôpital's Rule (/ Case)

Suppose f and g are differentiable functions over an open interval containing a, except possibly

at a. Suppose limf (x) =  (or -) and limg (x) =  (or -). Then,

   Problem:
   Applying L'Hôpital's Rule (/ Case)

   Evaluate each of the following limits by applying L'Hôpital's rule.

      a. 3x+5

                  lim

                        x 2x+1

      b. ln x

                   lim

                        x0+ cot x

Solution:

a. Since 3x + 5 and 2x + 1 are first-degree polynomials with positive leading

coefficients, lim (3x + 5) =  and lim (2x + 1) = . Therefore, we apply

                x                      x

L'Hôpital's rule and obtain

Equation:

                                       3x + 5                      3      3

                             lim               = lim                  =.

                             x 2x + 1          x 2                        2

Note that this limit can also be calculated without invoking L'Hôpital's rule. Earlier in
the chapter we showed how to evaluate such a limit by dividing the numerator and
denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator. In doing so, we saw that
Equation:

                             3x + 5            3 + 5/x                       3

                   lim                 = lim                              =.

                   x 2x + 1            x 2x + 1/x                            2

L'Hôpital's rule provides us with an alternative means of evaluating this type of limit.

b. Here, lim ln x = - and lim cot x = . Therefore, we can apply L'Hôpital's rule

           x0+               x0+

and obtain

Equation:

                                 ln x                         1/x            1
                    lim
                   x0+ cot x           = lim                       = lim         .
                                             x0+ -csc2x
                                                                   x0+ -x csc2x
        Now as x  0+, csc2x  . Therefore, the first term in the denominator is
        approaching zero and the second term is getting really large. In such a case, anything
        can happen with the product. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusion yet. To
        evaluate the limit, we use the definition of csc x to write
        Equation:

                                                           1                          2

                                      lim                                   sin x
                                     x0+ -x csc2x
                                                                = lim                    .

                                                                      x0+ -x

        Now lim sin2x = 0 and lim x = 0, so we apply L'Hôpital's rule again. We find

               x0+                   x0+

        Equation:

                                               2                2 sin x cos x            0

                                     sin x

                            lim                   = lim                        =            = 0.

                           x0+       -x                    x0+  -1                -1

        We conclude that
        Equation:

                                                                ln x  = 0.

As mentioned, L'Hôpital's rule is an extremely useful tool for evaluating limits. It is important

                                                                                                                                                                                                                            f (x)

to remember, however, that to apply L'Hôpital's rule to a quotient g(x) , it is essential that the
limit of g(x) f(x) be of the form 0 0 or /. Consider the following example.

   Because the limits of the numerator and denominator are not both zero and are not both

                                                                                                  (x + 5) = 2x
                                                                                          dx

and

                           dx

At which point we would conclude erroneously that
Equation:

However, since lim (x2 + 5) = 6 and lim (3x + 4) = 7, we actually have

           x1              x1

Equation:

                           x1 3x + 4                     7

We can conclude that

Determine the limits of the numerator and denominator separately.

Other Indeterminate Forms

L'Hôpital's rule is very useful for evaluating limits involving the indeterminate forms                                                 0  and
                                                                                                                                        0

/. However, we can also use L'Hôpital's rule to help evaluate limits involving other

indeterminate         forms  that  arise  when  evaluating  limits.  The  expressions                                 0      ,     -  ,                   0

                                                                                                                                           1,     ,

and      0  are  all  considered   indeterminate  forms.  These  expressions   are                                    not  real  numbers.  Rather,

     0

they represent forms that arise when trying to evaluate certain limits. Next we realize why these

are indeterminate forms and then understand how to use L'Hôpital's rule in these cases. The key

idea is that we must rewrite the indeterminate forms in such a way that we arrive at the

indeterminate form           0  or /.
                             0

Indeterminate Form of Type 0  

Suppose we want to evaluate lim (f (x)  g (x)), where f (x)  0 and g (x)   (or -) as

                                                                                                 xa

x  a. Since one term in the product is approaching zero but the other term is becoming
arbitrarily large (in magnitude), anything can happen to the product. We use the notation 0  
to denote the form that arises in this situation. The expression 0   is considered indeterminate
because we cannot determine without further analysis the exact behavior of the product
f (x)g (x) as x  a. For example, let n be a positive integer and consider

Equation:

                                   f (x) =                 1                                                       2

involving the indeterminate form 0   and show how to rewrite the function as a quotient to

Solution:

First, rewrite the function x ln x as a quotient to apply L'Hôpital's rule. If we write
Equation:

                                            x ln x =  ln x
                                                                ,

                                                      1/x

we see that ln x  - as x  0+ and 1   as x  0+. Therefore, we can apply

Indeterminate Form of Type  - 
Another type of indeterminate form is  - . Consider the following example. Let n be a
positive integer and let f (x) = 3xn and g (x) = 3x2 + 5. As x  , f (x)   and
g (x)  . We are interested in lim (f (x) - g (x)). Depending on whether f (x) grows

                                                                                                               x

faster, g (x) grows faster, or they grow at the same rate, as we see next, anything can happen in
this limit. Since f (x)   and g (x)  , we write  -  to denote the form of this limit.
As with our other indeterminate forms,  -  has no meaning on its own and we must do
more analysis to determine the value of the limit. For example, suppose the exponent n in the
function f (x) = 3xn is n = 3, then
Equation:

                                                                3  2
                     lim (f (x) - g (x)) = lim (3x - 3x - 5) = .

                     x                             x

On the other hand, if n = 2, then
Equation:

                                                           2       2
                     lim (f (x) - g (x)) = lim (3x - 3x - 5) = -5.

                     x                             x

However, if n = 1, then
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                     2

                     lim (f (x) - g (x)) = lim (3x - 3x - 5) = -.

                     x                             x

Therefore, the limit cannot be determined by considering only  - . Next we see how to
rewrite an expression involving the indeterminate form  -  as a fraction to apply
L'Hôpital's rule.

   Indeterminate Form of Type  - 

Evaluate lim ( 2 1 - ) 1 .
         x0+ x           tan x

Solution:

By combining the fractions, we can write the function as a quotient. Since the least
common denominator is x2tan x, we have
Equation:

                                   1 1 (tan x) - x2

                                       -           =                                .

                                x2 tan x

As  x        +  the  numerator  tan x  -      2    0  and  the  denominator                2                                                              0.  Therefore,

         0,                               x                                            x tan x

we can apply L'Hôpital's rule. Taking the derivatives of the numerator and the

denominator, we have

Equation:
                                                                                  2                          2

                                          (tan x) - x                                          (sec x) - 2x

                                lim                                                  = lim                       .

                               x0+             x2tan x                               x0+ x2sec2x + 2x tan x

As x  0+, (sec2x) - 2x  1 and x2sec2x + 2x tan x  0. Since the denominator is

positive as x approaches zero from the right, we conclude that
Equation:

                                                                                         2      = .

                                                                  (sec x) - 2x

                                               x0+ x2sec2x + 2x tan x

Therefore,
Equation:

                                                           1                            1

                                               lim (                                 -         ) = .

                                               x0+         x2                           tan x

Rewrite the difference of fractions as a single fraction.

Another type of indeterminate form that arises when evaluating limits involves exponents. The

expressions      0          0  and        are  all  indeterminate                       forms.  On  their  own,  these  expressions  are

             0,     ,               1

meaningless because we cannot actually evaluate these expressions as we would evaluate an

expression involving real numbers. Rather, these expressions represent forms that arise when

finding limits. Now we examine how L'Hôpital's rule can be used to evaluate limits involving

these indeterminate forms.

Since L'Hôpital's rule applies to quotients, we use the natural logarithm function and its
properties to reduce a problem evaluating a limit involving exponents to a related problem

involving a limit of a quotient. For example, suppose we want to evaluate limf(x)g(x) and we

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    xa
arrive at the indeterminate form 0. (The indeterminate forms 00 and 1 can be handled
similarly.) We proceed as follows. Let
Equation:

                                      g(x)

                        y = f (x)      .

Then,
Equation:

                        g(x)

                ln y = ln (f (x)  ) = g (x)ln (f (x)).

Therefore,
Equation:

                lim [ln (y)] = lim [g (x)ln (f (x))].

                xa                xa

Since limf (x) = , we know that limln (f (x)) = . Therefore, limg (x)ln (f (x)) is of

xa                  xa                                                                                                                               xa

the indeterminate form 0  , and we can use the techniques discussed earlier to rewrite the

expression g (x)ln (f (x)) in a form so that we can apply L'Hôpital's rule. Suppose

limg (x)ln (f (x)) = L, where L may be  or -. Then

xa

Equation:

                        lim [ln (y)] = L.

                        xa

Since the natural logarithm function is continuous, we conclude that
Equation:

                                                                                             ln (lim y) = L,

which gives us
Equation:

                    lim y = lim f (x)       =e .

that

                                                                                       -1/ (x(ln x) )

Unfortunately, we not only have another expression involving the indeterminate form
0  , but the new limit is even more complicated to evaluate than the one with which we
started. Instead, we try the second option. By writing
Equation:

                                                                                  ln x              ln x

                                                                    sin x ln x =              =             ,

                                                                                  1/sin x         csc x

and applying L'Hôpital's rule, we obtain
Equation:

                                                                    ln x                               1/x                -1

     lim sin x ln x = lim                                                 = lim                             = lim                 .
                                                                                x0+ -csc x cot x

Using the fact that csc x =                    1                    and cot x =    cos x   ,  we    can     rewrite  the  expression  on  the
                                           sin x                                   sin x

right-hand side as

            -sin x                    = lim [                        (-tan x)] = ( lim                     )  ( lim (-tan x)) = 1  0 = 0.
                                            x0+ x
 lim                                                                                     x0+ x                 x0+
x0+ x cos x

We conclude that lim ln y = 0. Therefore, ln ( lim y) = 0 and we have

                                      x0+                                                x0+

Equation:

                                                                                  sin x          0

                                                                    lim y = lim x          = e = 1.

Hence,

                                                                                  sin x

Growth Rates of Functions

Suppose the functions f and g both approach infinity as x  . Although the values of both

functions become arbitrarily large as the values of x become sufficiently large, sometimes one

function  is  growing  more   quickly              than     the  other.  For  example,  f  (x)  =      2  and     g  (x)  =      3  both

                                                                                                   x                         x

approach infinity as x  . However, as shown in the following table, the values of x3 are

growing   much  faster  than  the  values               of      2

                                                            x.

Comparing the Growth Rates of x2 and x3

In fact,
Equation:

                          x3                                                            x2                     1
                                                                                            = lim
               lim            = lim x = . or, equivalently, lim                                                   = 0.
              x x2                                                                                x x

As a result, we say x3 is growing more rapidly than x2 as x  . On the other hand, for

f  (x)  =      2  and                    g  (x)  =           2  +  4x  +       1,   although            the  values  of  g  (x)  are               always       greater  than  the

           x                                        3x

values of f (x) for x > 0, each value of g (x) is roughly three times the corresponding value of

f (x) as x  , as shown in the following table. In fact,

Equation:

In  this  case,   we                     say  that      2  and              2  +  4x  +         1  are  growing  at  the    same                   rate  as  x    .

More generally, suppose f and g are two functions that approach infinity as x  . We say g
grows more rapidly than f as x   if
Equation:

                                                          g (x)                                                                             f (x)  = 0.
                                               lim                  = ; or, equivalently, lim
                                              x f (x)
                                                                                                                               x g (x)

On the other hand, if there exists a constant M  0 such that
Equation:

                                                                                                f (x)   = M,
                                                                                     lim
                                                                                    x g (x)

we say f and g grow at the same rate as x  .

Next we see how to use L'Hôpital's rule to compare the growth rates of power, exponential, and
logarithmic functions.

   Problem:
   Comparing the Growth Rates of ln (x), x2, and ex

For each of the following pairs of functions, use L'Hôpital's rule to evaluate          f (x)

                                                                                lim  (         ).

                                                                                x       g(x)

a. f (x) = x2 and g (x) = ex
b. f (x) = ln (x) and g (x) = x2

Solution:

a. Since lim x2 =  and lim ex = , we can use L'Hôpital's rule to evaluate

           x             x

lim [ x ]. x2 We obtain

x e

Equation:

                                              x2         2x

                                   lim            = lim            .
                                  x ex
                                                  x ex

Since lim 2x =  and lim ex = , we can apply L'Hôpital's rule again. Since

           x             x

Equation:

                                        2x                      2  = 0,

                             lim            = lim
                            x ex                  x ex

we conclude that
Equation:

                                              x2  = 0.

                                  x ex

Therefore, ex grows more rapidly than x2 as x   (See [link] and [link]).

b. Since  lim ln x =  and     lim          2  =  ,   we     can  use  L'Hôpital's        rule  to  evaluate

Equation:

                                    ln x                    1/x                       1

                              x     x2

Thus,         2  grows  more  rapidly  than   ln  x  as  x         (see  [link]          and   [link]).

Key Concepts

   L'Hôpital's rule can be used to evaluate the limit of a quotient when the indeterminate form

   0 or / arises.

   0

   L'Hôpital's rule can also be applied to other indeterminate forms if they can be rewritten in

   terms of a limit involving a quotient that has the indeterminate form                                                                      0      or /.
                                                                                                                                              0

   The  exponential  function     x  grows                                                                faster  than  any  power  function      p  p  >  0.

      Recognize when Newton's method does not work.
      Apply iterative processes to various situations.

In many areas of pure and applied mathematics, we are interested in finding
solutions to an equation of the form f (x) = 0. For most functions,
however, it is difficult--if not impossible--to calculate their zeroes
explicitly. In this section, we take a look at a technique that provides a very
efficient way of approximating the zeroes of functions. This technique
makes use of tangent line approximations and is behind the method used
often by calculators and computers to find zeroes.

Describing Newton's Method

Consider the task of finding the solutions of f (x) = 0. If f is the first-

degree polynomial f (x) = ax + b, then the solution of f (x) = 0 is given

by  the  formula  x  =  -  b  .  If  f  is  the  second-degree  polynomial
                           a

f (x) = ax2 + bx + c, the solutions of f (x) = 0 can be found by using

the quadratic formula. However, for polynomials of degree 3 or more,

finding roots of f becomes more complicated. Although formulas exist for

third- and fourth-degree polynomials, they are quite complicated. Also, if f

is a polynomial of degree 5 or greater, it is known that no such formulas

exist. For example, consider the function

Equation:

                                        5        4  3
                        f (x) = x + 8x + 4x - 2x - 7.

No formula exists that allows us to find the solutions of f (x) = 0. Similar
difficulties exist for nonpolynomial functions. For example, consider the
task of finding solutions of tan (x) - x = 0. No simple formula exists for
the solutions of this equation. In cases such as these, we can use Newton's
method to approximate the roots.
Newton's method makes use of the following idea to approximate the
solutions of f (x) = 0. By sketching a graph of f, we can estimate a root of
f (x) = 0. Let's call this estimate x0. We then draw the tangent line to f at
x0. If f  (x0)  0, this tangent line intersects the x-axis at some point
(x1, 0). Now let x1 be the next approximation to the actual root. Typically,
x1 is closer than x0 to an actual root. Next we draw the tangent line to f at
x1. If f  (x1)  0, this tangent line also intersects the x-axis, producing
another approximation, x2. We continue in this way, deriving a list of
approximations: x0, x1, x2,.... Typically, the numbers x0, x1, x2,... quickly
approach an actual root x*, as shown in the following figure.

     The approximations x0, x1, x2,... approach the actual root x*. The
   approximations are derived by looking at tangent lines to the graph of
                                     f.

Now let's look at how to calculate the approximations x0, x1, x2,.... If x0 is
our first approximation, the approximation x1 is defined by letting (x1, 0)
be the x-intercept of the tangent line to f at x0. The equation of this tangent
line is given by
Equation:

                                                                                                                              

                                                    y = f (x0) + f (x0) (x - x0).

Therefore, x1 must satisfy
Equation:

                                                                                                            

                                                   f (x0) + f (x0) (x1 - x0) = 0.

Solving this equation for x1, we conclude that
Equation:

x1 = x0 -                                f (x0)
                                                         .

                                         f (x0)

Similarly, the point (x2, 0) is the x-intercept of the tangent line to f at x1.
Therefore, x2 satisfies the equation
Equation:

x2 = x1 -                                f (x1)
                                                         .

                                         f (x1)

In general, for n > 0, xn satisfies
Equation:
                        xn = xn-1 -        f (xn-1)
                                                                 .

                                           f (xn-1)

Next we see how to make use of this technique to approximate the root of
the polynomial f (x) = x3 - 3x + 1.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Finding a Root of a Polynomial

Use  Newton's  method   to  approximate      a  root  of  f         (x)  =          3  -  3x  +   1

                                                                                x

in the interval [1, 2]. Let x0 = 2 and find x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5.

Solution:

From [link], we see that f has one root over the interval (1, 2).

Therefore x0 = 2 seems like a reasonable first approximation. To find

the  next  approximation,  we  use  [link].  Since    f  (x)        =        3  -      3x  +  1,

                                                                         x

the derivative is f  (x) = 3x2 - 3. Using [link] with n = 1 (and a

calculator that displays 10 digits), we obtain

Equation:

                f (x0)              f (2)                3

     x1 = x0 -             = 2-              = 2-                    1.666666667.

                f (x0)              f (2)                9

To find the next approximation, x2, we use [link] with n = 2 and the
value of x1 stored on the calculator. We find that
Equation:

                x2 = x1 =      f (x1)   1.548611111.
                               f (x1)
Continuing in this way, we obtain the following results:
Equation:

                                                          x1  1.666666667
                                                          x2  1.548611111
                                                          x3  1.532390162
                                                          x4  1.532088989
                                                          x5  1.532088886
                                                          x6  1.532088886.

We note that we obtained the same value for x5 and x6. Therefore,
any subsequent application of Newton's method will most likely give
the same value for xn.

   The function f (x) = x3 - 3x + 1 has one root
                  over the interval [1, 2].

Newton's method can also be used to approximate square roots. Here we
show how to approximate 2. This method can be modified to
approximate the square root of any positive number.

   Problem:
   Finding a Square Root

Use Newton's method to approximate 2 ([link]). Let
f (x) = x2 - 2, let x0 = 2, and calculate x1, x2, x3, x4, x5. (We note
that since f (x) = x2 - 2 has a zero at 2, the initial value x0 = 2 is
a reasonable choice to approximate 2. )

Solution:

For f (x) = x2 - 2, f  (x) = 2x. From [link], we know that
Equation:

                          (  )
                     xn  = xn-1 -      f (xn-1)
                                       f (xn-1)

                         = xn-1 -          2

                                       x n-1-2
                                          2xn-1

                         =    1             1
                                        xn-1
                              2 xn-1 +

                         =    1              2

                              2 (xn-1 +           ).

                                         xn-1

Therefore,
Equation:

x1 =        1         2       1        2

            2 (x0 +       )=     (2 +     ) = 1.5

                     x0       2        2

            1        2        1          2
x2 = 2 (x1 + x1 ) = 2 (1.5 + 1.5 )  1.416666667.

Continuing in this way, we find that
Equation:

                                                          x1 = 1.5
                                                          x2  1.416666667
                                                          x3  1.414215686
                                                          x4  1.414213562

Since we obtained the same value for x4 and x5, it is unlikely that the
value xn will change on any subsequent application of Newton's

method. We conclude that 2  1.414213562.
                  We can use Newton's method to find 2.

Hint

For f (x) = x2 - 3, [link] reduces to xn = + . xn-1 3
                        2  2xn-1

When using Newton's method, each approximation after the initial guess is
defined in terms of the previous approximation by using the same formula.

                                                                                                                                                                                  f (x)

In particular, by defining the function F (x) = x - [ f(x) ], we can rewrite
[link] as xn = F (xn-1). This type of process, where each xn is defined in
terms of xn-1 by repeating the same function, is an example of an iterative
process. Shortly, we examine other iterative processes. First, let's look at
the reasons why Newton's method could fail to find a root.

Failures of Newton's Method

Typically, Newton's method is used to find roots fairly quickly. However,
things can go wrong. Some reasons why Newton's method might fail
include the following:

   1. At one of the approximations xn, the derivative f  is zero at xn, but
      f (xn)  0. As a result, the tangent line of f at xn does not intersect
      the x-axis. Therefore, we cannot continue the iterative process.

   2. The approximations x0, x1, x2,... may approach a different root. If the
      function f has more than one root, it is possible that our
      approximations do not approach the one for which we are looking, but
      approach a different root (see [link]). This event most often occurs
      when we do not choose the approximation x0 close enough to the
      desired root.

   3. The approximations may fail to approach a root entirely. In [link], we
      provide an example of a function and an initial guess x0 such that the
      successive approximations never approach a root because the
     successive approximations continue to alternate back and forth
     between two values.

     If the initial guess x0 is too far from the root sought, it may lead to
                 approximations that approach a different root.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   When Newton's Method Fails
   Consider the function f (x) = x3 - 2x + 2. Let x0 = 0. Show that
   the sequence x1, x2,... fails to approach a root of f.
Solution:

For f (x) = x3 - 2x + 2, the derivative is f  (x) = 3x2 - 2.
Therefore,
Equation:

x1 = x0 -          f (x0)  = 0-  f (0)                 2  = 1.
                                 f  (0)  =-
                        
                                                     -2
                   f (x0)

In the next step,
Equation:

                   f (x1)        f (1)         1

x2 = x1 -                  = 1-          = 1-             = 0.

                   f (x1) f  (1) 1

Consequently, the numbers x0, x1, x2,... continue to bounce back and
forth between 0 and 1 and never get closer to the root of f which is
over the interval [-2, -1] (see [link]). Fortunately, if we choose an
initial approximation x0 closer to the actual root, we can avoid this
situation.
          The approximations continue to alternate
      between 0 and 1 and never approach the root of

                                                                  f.

Hint
Use [link].

From [link], we see that Newton's method does not always work. However,
when it does work, the sequence of approximations approaches the root
very quickly. Discussions of how quickly the sequence of approximations
approach a root found using Newton's method are included in texts on
numerical analysis.

Other Iterative Processes

As mentioned earlier, Newton's method is a type of iterative process. We
now look at an example of a different type of iterative process.
Consider a function F and an initial number x0. Define the subsequent
numbers xn by the formula xn = F (xn-1). This process is an iterative
process that creates a list of numbers x0, x1, x2,..., xn,.... This list of
numbers may approach a finite number x* as n gets larger, or it may not. In
[link], we see an example of a function F and an initial guess x0 such that
the resulting list of numbers approaches a finite value.

Example:
Exercise:

   about what happens to this list of numbers x1, x2, x3..., xn,... as
   n  . If the list of numbers x1, x2, x3,... approaches a finite
   number x*, then x* satisfies x*= F (x*), and x* is called a fixed

n  . Starting at the point (x0, x0), we draw a vertical line to the

point (x0, F (x0)). The next number in our list is x1 = F (x0). We

use x1 to calculate x2. Therefore, we draw a horizontal line

connecting (x0, x1) to the point (x1, x1) on the line y = x, and then

draw a vertical line connecting (x1, x1) to the point (x1, F (x1)). The

output F (x1) becomes x2. Continuing in this way, we could create an

infinite number of line segments. These line segments are trapped

between the lines F (x) =  x  + 4 and y = x. The line segments get
                           2

closer to the intersection point of these two lines, which occurs when

x = F (x). Solving the equation x =  x  + 4, we conclude they
                                     2

intersect at x = 8. Therefore, our graphical evidence agrees with our

numerical evidence that the list of numbers x0, x1, x2,... approaches

x*= 8 as n  .

This iterative process approaches the value
                      x*= 8.

Note:
Iterative Processes and Chaos
Iterative processes can yield some very interesting behavior. In this section,
we have seen several examples of iterative processes that converge to a
fixed point. We also saw in [link] that the iterative process bounced back
and forth between two values. We call this kind of behavior a 2-cycle.
Iterative processes can converge to cycles with various periodicities, such
as 2 - cycles, 4 - cycles (where the iterative process repeats a sequence
of four values), 8-cycles, and so on.
Some iterative processes yield what mathematicians call chaos. In this
case, the iterative process jumps from value to value in a seemingly
random fashion and never converges or settles into a cycle. Although a
complete exploration of chaos is beyond the scope of this text, in this
project we look at one of the key properties of a chaotic iterative process:
sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This property refers to the
concept that small changes in initial conditions can generate drastically
different behavior in the iterative process.
Probably the best-known example of chaos is the Mandelbrot set (see
[link]), named after Benoit Mandelbrot (1924-2010), who investigated its
properties and helped popularize the field of chaos theory. The Mandelbrot
set is usually generated by computer and shows fascinating details on
enlargement, including self-replication of the set. Several colorized
versions of the set have been shown in museums and can be found online
and in popular books on the subject.

       The Mandelbrot set is a well-known example of a set of points
      generated by the iterative chaotic behavior of a relatively simple

                                        function.
In this project we use the logistic map
Equation:

                              f (x) = rx (1 - x), where x  [0, 1] and r > 0

as the function in our iterative process. The logistic map is a deceptively
simple function; but, depending on the value of r, the resulting iterative
process displays some very interesting behavior. It can lead to fixed points,
cycles, and even chaos.
To visualize the long-term behavior of the iterative process associated with
the logistic map, we will use a tool called a cobweb diagram. As we did
with the iterative process we examined earlier in this section, we first draw
a vertical line from the point (x0, 0) to the point (x0, f (x0)) = (x0, x1).
We then draw a horizontal line from that point to the point (x1, x1), then
draw a vertical line to (x1, f (x1)) = (x1, x2), and continue the process
until the long-term behavior of the system becomes apparent. [link] shows
the long-term behavior of the logistic map when r = 3.55 and x0 = 0.2.
(The first 100 iterations are not plotted.) The long-term behavior of this
iterative process is an 8-cycle.
A cobweb diagram for f (x) = 3.55x (1 - x)
   is presented here. The sequence of values
               results in an 8-cycle.

1. Let r = 0.5 and choose x0 = 0.2. Either by hand or by using a
  computer, calculate the first 10 values in the sequence. Does the
  sequence appear to converge? If so, to what value? Does it result in a
  cycle? If so, what kind of cycle (for example,

     2 - cycle, 4 - cycle. )?

2. What happens when r = 2?
3. For r = 3.2 and r = 3.5, calculate the first 100 sequence values.

  Generate a cobweb diagram for each iterative process. (Several free
  applets are available online that generate cobweb diagrams for the
  logistic map.) What is the long-term behavior in each of these cases?
4. Now let r = 4. Calculate the first 100 sequence values and generate a
  cobweb diagram. What is the long-term behavior in this case?
5. Repeat the process for r = 4, but let x0 = 0.201. How does this
  behavior compare with the behavior for x0 = 0.2?

Key Concepts

      Newton's method approximates roots of f (x) = 0 by starting with an
      initial approximation x0, then uses tangent lines to the graph of f to
      create a sequence of approximations x1, x2, x3,....
      Typically, Newton's method is an efficient method for finding a
      particular root. In certain cases, Newton's method fails to work
      because the list of numbers x0, x1, x2,... does not approach a finite
      value or it approaches a value other than the root sought.
      Any process in which a list of numbers x0, x1, x2,... is generated by
      defining an initial number x0 and defining the subsequent numbers by
      the equation xn = F (xn-1) for some function F is an iterative
      process. Newton's method is an example of an iterative process, where

                                                                                                               f (x)

Antiderivatives

Find the general antiderivative of a given function.
Explain the terms and notation used for an indefinite integral.
State the power rule for integrals.
Use antidifferentiation to solve simple initial-value problems.

At this point, we have seen how to calculate derivatives of many functions and have been introduced
to a variety of their applications. We now ask a question that turns this process around: Given a
function f, how do we find a function with the derivative f and why would we be interested in such a
function?

We answer the first part of this question by defining antiderivatives. The antiderivative of a function f

is a function with a derivative f. Why are we interested in antiderivatives? The need for

antiderivatives arises in many situations, and we look at various examples throughout the remainder of

the text. Here we examine one specific example that involves rectilinear motion. In our examination in

Derivatives of rectilinear motion, we showed that given a position function s (t) of an object, then its

velocity  function  v  (t)  is  the  derivative     of  s  (t)--that     is,    v  (t)                                                                 =         (t).  Furthermore,  the  acceleration

                                                                                                                                                           s

a (t) is the derivative of the velocity v (t)--that is, a (t) = v (t) = s (t). Now suppose we are

given an acceleration function a, but not the velocity function v or the position function s. Since

a (t) = v (t), determining the velocity function requires us to find an antiderivative of the

acceleration  function.     Then,    since  v  (t)  =         (t),    determining                                                                      the  position   function  requires  us  to  find

                                                        s

an antiderivative of the velocity function. Rectilinear motion is just one case in which the need for

antiderivatives arises. We will see many more examples throughout the remainder of the text. For now,

let's look at the terminology and notation for antiderivatives, and determine the antiderivatives for

several types of functions. We examine various techniques for finding antiderivatives of more

complicated functions later in the text (Introduction to Techniques of Integration).

The Reverse of Differentiation

At this point, we know how to find derivatives of various functions. We now ask the opposite
question. Given a function f, how can we find a function with derivative f? If we can find a function
F derivative f, we call F an antiderivative of f.

Note:
Definition
A function F is an antiderivative of the function f if
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                     

                                                                                                    F (x) = f (x)

for all x in the domain of f.

Consider the function f (x) = 2x. Knowing the power rule of differentiation, we conclude that

F (x) = x2 is an antiderivative of f since F  (x) = 2x. Are there any other antiderivatives of f? Yes;

since  the  derivative  of  any  constant      C  is  zero,        2  +  C  is  also                                                                   an  antiderivative  of  2x.   Therefore,

                                                              x
x2 + 5 and x2 - 2 are also antiderivatives. Are there any others that are not of the form x2 + C for
some constant C? The answer is no. From Corollary 2 of the Mean Value Theorem, we know that if F
and G are differentiable functions such that F  (x) = G (x), then F (x) - G (x) = C for some
constant C. This fact leads to the following important theorem.

Note:
General Form of an Antiderivative
Let F be an antiderivative of f over an interval I. Then,

   i. for each constant C, the function F (x) + C is also an antiderivative of f over I;
  ii. if G is an antiderivative of f over I, there is a constant C for which G (x) = F (x) + C over I.

In other words, the most general form of the antiderivative of f over I is F (x) + C.

We use this fact and our knowledge of derivatives to find all the antiderivatives for several functions.

   Problem:
   Finding Antiderivatives

   For each of the following functions, find all antiderivatives.

      a. f (x) = 3x2
      b. f (x) = 1

                                                       x

      c. f (x) = cos x
      d. f (x) = ex

Solution:

   a. Because
      Equation:

                                             d    3          2

                                                  (x ) = 3x

                                             dx

then F (x) = x3 is an antiderivative of 3x2. Therefore, every antiderivative of 3x2 is of the

form       3  +  C  for  some  constant  C,  and  every  function  of  the  form       3  +  C  is  an

      x                                                                           x

antiderivative of 3x2.

b. Let f (x) = ln |x|. For x > 0, f (x) = ln (x) and

Equation:

                                             d
                                                   d                 1
                                                         (ln x) =        .

                                                  dx                 x

For x < 0, f (x) = ln (-x) and
Equation:

                                            d                        1         1

                                               (ln (-x)) = -                =      .

                                  dx                               -x          x

Therefore,
Equation:

                                                   d                 1
                                                         (ln |x|) =      .

                                                  dx                 x

Thus, F (x) = ln |x| is an antiderivative of x . 1 Therefore, every antiderivative of x 1 is of

the form ln |x| + C for some constant C and every function of the form ln |x| + C is an

antiderivative of         1

                             .

                          x

c. We have

Equation:

                                                   d
                                                         (sin x) = cos x,

                                                  dx

  so F (x) = sin x is an antiderivative of cos x. Therefore, every antiderivative of cos x is of
  the form sin x + C for some constant C and every function of the form sin x + C is an
  antiderivative of cos x.
d. Since
  Equation:

                                                                                                  dx x
                                                                                                        (e ) = e ,

                                                                                                dx

then  F  (x)    =      x  is  an  antiderivative  of      x  Therefore,     every  antiderivative     of      x  is  of  the

                   e                                  e.                                                  e

form      x  +  C  for    some    constant  C  and  every    function    of  the   form      x  +  C  is  an

      e                                                                                  e

antiderivative     of         x

                          e.

Indefinite Integrals

We now look at the formal notation used to represent antiderivatives and examine some of their
properties. These properties allow us to find antiderivatives of more complicated functions. Given a
function f, we use the notation f  (x) or dx df to denote the derivative of f. Here we introduce notation
for antiderivatives. If F is an antiderivative of f, we say that F (x) + C is the most general
antiderivative of f and write
Equation:

                                                                                          f (x)dx = F (x) + C.

The symbol  is called an integral sign, and  f (x)dx is called the indefinite integral of f.

Note:
Definition
Given a function f, the indefinite integral of f, denoted
Equation:

                                                                                                           f (x)dx,

is the most general antiderivative of f. If F is an antiderivative of f, then
Equation:

                                                                                          f (x)dx = F (x) + C.

The expression f (x) is called the integrand and the variable x is the variable of integration.

Given the terminology introduced in this definition, the act of finding the antiderivatives of a function
f is usually referred to as integrating f.
For a function f and an antiderivative F , the functions F (x) + C, where C is any real number, is
often referred to as the family of antiderivatives of f. For example, since x2 is an antiderivative of 2x
and any antiderivative of 2x is of the form x2 + C, we write
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                    2

                                                                                                2x dx = x + C.

The  collection  of  all  functions      of  the  form        2  +  C,  where     C  is                                                                                                any  real  number,  is  known  as  the

                                                         x

family of antiderivatives of 2x. [link] shows a graph of this family of antiderivatives.

     The family of antiderivatives of 2x consists of all functions of the form

                               2  +  C,  where    C  is  any     real  number.

For some functions, evaluating indefinite integrals follows directly from properties of derivatives. For
example, for n  -1,
Equation:

                                                                n            n+1

                                                   x dx =               x

                                                                                  + C,

                                                                        n+1
which comes directly from
Equation:

                           d xn+1                              xn                  n

                           (         ) = (n + 1)                     =x .

                           dx n + 1                            n+1

This fact is known as the power rule for integrals.

Integration Formulas

From the definition of indefinite integral of f, we know
Equation:

                                      f (x)dx = F (x) + C

if and only if F is an antiderivative of f. Therefore, when claiming that
Equation:

antiderivatives  of  x  and      x  respectively,         and  the  sum  of    the              antiderivatives  is  an

                             e,

antiderivative of the sum. We discuss this fact again later in this section.

b. Using the product rule, we see that

Equation:

                             d      x              x           x            x                   x  x

                                 (xe - e + C) = e + xe - e = xe .

                        dx

Therefore, the statement
Equation:

                                                       x       x         x

                                                 xe dx = xe - e + C

is correct.

Note that we are verifying an indefinite integral for a product. The antiderivative xex - ex

is not a product of the antiderivatives. Furthermore, the product of antiderivatives, x2ex/2

is  not  an  antiderivative  of           x  since

                                 xe

Equation:
                                              d x2ex                 x    x2ex                     x
                                                                              2
                                              (       ) = xe +                    xe .

                                          dx     2

         In general, the product of antiderivatives is not an antiderivative of a product.

Note:

   Solution:

                                   dx

In [link], we listed the indefinite integrals for many elementary functions. Let's now turn our attention
to evaluating indefinite integrals for more complicated functions. For example, consider finding an
antiderivative of a sum f + g. In [link]a. we showed that an antiderivative of the sum x + ex is given

by  the  sum  (  x2  )  +  ex--that  is,  an  antiderivative  of  a  sum  is  given  by  a  sum       of  antiderivatives.  This
                  2

result was not specific to this example. In general, if F and G are antiderivatives of any functions f
and g, respectively, then
Equation:

                            d 
                                  (F (x) + G (x)) = F (x) + G (x) = f (x) + g (x).

                           dx

Therefore, F (x) + G (x) is an antiderivative of f (x) + g (x) and we have
Equation:

                            (f (x) + g (x))dx = F (x) + G (x) + C.

Similarly,
Equation:

                            (f (x) - g (x))dx = F (x) - G (x) + C.
In addition, consider the task of finding an antiderivative of kf (x), where k is any real number. Since
Equation:

d                                        d   

    (kf (x)) = k                             F (x) = kF (x)

dx                                       dx

for any real number k, we conclude that
Equation:

     kf (x)dx = kF (x) + C.

These properties are summarized next.

Note:

                                                                      (f (x)±g (x))dx = F (x)±G (x) + C

Constant Multiples
Equation:

                                                                                      kf (x)dx = kF (x) + C

From this theorem, we can evaluate any integral involving a sum, difference, or constant multiple of
functions with antiderivatives that are known. Evaluating integrals involving products, quotients, or
compositions is more complicated (see [link]b. for an example involving an antiderivative of a
product.) We look at and address integrals involving these more complicated functions in Introduction
to Integration. In the next example, we examine how to use this theorem to calculate the indefinite
integrals of several functions.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:

d.  tan x cos x dx

Solution:

   a. Using [link], we can integrate each of the four terms in the integrand separately. We obtain
      Equation:

                          3         2                        3                    2
         (5x - 7x + 3x + 4)dx =  5x dx-  7x dx +  3x dx +  4dx.

From the second part of [link], each coefficient can be written in front of the integral sign,
which gives
Equation:

     3                        2                                          3                     2
 5x dx-  7x dx +  3x dx +  4dx = 5  x dx - 7  x dx + 3  x dx + 4  1dx.

Using the power rule for integrals, we conclude that
Equation:

                                 3     2                        5  4        7     3     3  2

               (5x - 7x + 3x + 4)dx = x - x + x + 4x + C.

                                                                4           3           2

b. Rewrite the integrand as
  Equation:

                                             2      3        x2                3
                                          x + 4x
                                                                      4x

                                                       =           +              = 0.

                                                 x           x           x

Then, to evaluate the integral, integrate each of these terms separately. Using the power
rule, we have
Equation:

                                          4                                          -2/3

                               (x +              )dx   =  x dx + 4  x                      dx

                                          x 2/3

                                                          12                1           (-2/3)+1

                                                       =     x     + 4 -2            x            +C

                                                          2           (     )+1

                                                                         3

                                                          12                1/3   + C.
                                                       = x + 12x
                                                          2

c. Using [link], write the integral as
      Equation:

                                        4               1

                                                                   dx.
                                                  1 + x2

      Then, use the fact that tan-1 (x) is an antiderivative of                1  to conclude that
                                                                        (1+x2 )

      Equation:

                                     4            -1

                                             dx = 4 tan (x) + C.

                                     1 + x2

      d. Rewrite the integrand as
        Equation:

                                   tan x cos x =  sin x
                                                                cos x = sin x.

                                                  cos x

      Therefore,
      Equation:

                                    tan x cos x =  sin x = -cos x + C.

Initial-Value Problems

We look at techniques for integrating a large variety of functions involving products, quotients, and
compositions later in the text. Here we turn to one common use for antiderivatives that arises often in
many applications: solving differential equations.
A differential equation is an equation that relates an unknown function and one or more of its
derivatives. The equation
Equation:

                               dy  = f (x)
                               dx

is a simple example of a differential equation. Solving this equation means finding a function y with a
derivative f. Therefore, the solutions of [link] are the antiderivatives of f. If F is one antiderivative of
f, every function of the form y = F (x) + C is a solution of that differential equation. For example,
the solutions of
Equation:

                               dy                    2
                               dx
                                   = 6x

are given by
Equation:

                               2                        3

                               y =  6x dx = 2x + C.

Sometimes we are interested in determining whether a particular solution curve passes through a
certain point (x0, y0)--that is, y (x0) = y0. The problem of finding a function y that satisfies a
differential equation
Equation:

                               dy  = f (x)
                               dx

with the additional condition
Equation:

                               y (x0 ) = y0

is an example of an initial-value problem. The condition y (x0) = y0 is known as an initial
condition. For example, looking for a function y that satisfies the differential equation
Equation:

                               dy                    2
                               dx
                                   = 6x

and the initial condition
Equation:

                               y (1) = 5
is an example of an initial-value problem. Since the solutions of the differential equation are
y = 2x3 + C, to find a function y that also satisfies the initial condition, we need to find C such that
y (1) = 2(1) + C = 5. 3 From this equation, we see that C = 3, and we conclude that y = 2x3 + 3 is
the solution of this initial-value problem as shown in the following graph.

Some of the solution curves of the differential equation dx = 6x dy 2 are

displayed.  The  function  y  =           3  +  3  satisfies  the  differential  equation  and

                                 2x

                 the initial condition y(1) = 5.

                                                dx
   Solution:

                                                                                                                                                                                 dy

   First we need to solve the differential equation. If dx = sin x, then
   Equation:

                                                                                y =  sin (x)dx = -cos x + C.

   Next we need to look for a solution y that satisfies the initial condition. The initial condition
   y (0) = 5 means we need a constant C such that -cos x + C = 5. Therefore,
   Equation:

                                                                                             C = 5 + cos (0) = 6.

   The solution of the initial-value problem is y = -cos x + 6.

Initial-value problems arise in many applications. Next we consider a problem in which a driver
applies the brakes in a car. We are interested in how long it takes for the car to stop. Recall that the
velocity function v (t) is the derivative of a position function s (t), and the acceleration a (t) is the
derivative of the velocity function. In earlier examples in the text, we could calculate the velocity from
the position and then compute the acceleration from the velocity. In the next example we work the
other way around. Given an acceleration function, we calculate the velocity function. We then use the
velocity function to determine the position function.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Decelerating Car
A car is traveling at the rate of 88 ft/sec (60 mph) when the brakes are applied. The car begins
decelerating at a constant rate of 15 ft/sec2.

   a. How many seconds elapse before the car stops?
   b. How far does the car travel during that time?

Solution:

   a. First we introduce variables for this problem. Let t be the time (in seconds) after the brakes
      are first applied. Let a (t) be the acceleration of the car (in feet per seconds squared) at time
      t. Let v (t) be the velocity of the car (in feet per second) at time t. Let s (t) be the car's
      position (in feet) beyond the point where the brakes are applied at time t.
      The car is traveling at a rate of 88 ft/sec. Therefore, the initial velocity is v (0) = 88
      ft/sec. Since the car is decelerating, the acceleration is
      Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                  2

                                                                                                a (t) = -15 f t/s .

The acceleration is the derivative of the velocity,
Equation:

                                                                                                                                    

                                                                                          v (t) = -15.

Therefore, we have an initial-value problem to solve:
Equation:

                                                                                                                

                                                                            v (t) = -15, v (0) = 88.

Integrating, we find that
Equation:

                             v (t) = -15t + C.

Since v (0) = 88, C = 88. Thus, the velocity function is
Equation:

                                                                                   v (t) = -15t + 88.

To find how long it takes for the car to stop, we need to find the time t such that the

velocity is zero. Solving -15t + 88 = 0, we obtain t =                                                                                88  sec.
                                                                                                                                      15

b. To find how far the car travels during this time, we need to find the position of the car after

88  sec. We know the velocity v (t) is the derivative of the position s (t). Consider the
15

initial position to be s (0) = 0. Therefore, we need to solve the initial-value problem

Equation:

                           
                          

                      s (t) = -15t + 88, s (0) = 0.

Integrating, we have
Equation:

                                 15 2

                      s (t) = -     t + 88t + C.

                                 2

Since s (0) = 0, the constant is C = 0. Therefore, the position function is
Equation:

                                    15 2

                      s (t) = -        t + 88t.

                                    2

After t = 15 88 sec, the position is s ( 15 ) 88  258.133 ft.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem:

   Suppose the car is traveling at the rate of 44 ft/sec. How long does it take for the car to stop?
   How far will the car travel?

   Solution:

Hint

v (t) = -15t + 44.

Key Concepts

If F is an antiderivative of f, then every antiderivative of f is of the form F (x) + C for some
constant C.
Solving the initial-value problem
Equation:

                      dy  = f (x), y (x0 ) = y0
                      dx

Iceboats are a common sight on the lakes of Wisconsin and Minnesota on
winter weekends. Iceboats are similar to sailboats, but they are fitted with
runners, or "skates," and are designed to run over the ice, rather than on
water. Iceboats can move very quickly, and many ice boating enthusiasts are
drawn to the sport because of the speed. Top iceboat racers can attain
speeds up to five times the wind speed. If we know how fast an iceboat is
moving, we can use integration to determine how far it travels. We revisit
this question later in the chapter (see [link]).

Determining distance from velocity is just one of many applications of
integration. In fact, integrals are used in a wide variety of mechanical and
physical applications. In this chapter, we first introduce the theory behind
integration and use integrals to calculate areas. From there, we develop the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which relates differentiation and
integration. We then study some basic integration techniques and briefly
examine some applications.
Approximating Areas

      Use sigma (summation) notation to calculate sums and powers of integers.
      Use the sum of rectangular areas to approximate the area under a curve.
      Use Riemann sums to approximate area.

Archimedes was fascinated with calculating the areas of various shapes--in other words, the amount of
space enclosed by the shape. He used a process that has come to be known as the method of exhaustion,
which used smaller and smaller shapes, the areas of which could be calculated exactly, to fill an irregular
region and thereby obtain closer and closer approximations to the total area. In this process, an area bounded
by curves is filled with rectangles, triangles, and shapes with exact area formulas. These areas are then
summed to approximate the area of the curved region.

In this section, we develop techniques to approximate the area between a curve, defined by a function f (x),
and the x-axis on a closed interval [a, b]. Like Archimedes, we first approximate the area under the curve
using shapes of known area (namely, rectangles). By using smaller and smaller rectangles, we get closer and
closer approximations to the area. Taking a limit allows us to calculate the exact area under the curve.

Let's start by introducing some notation to make the calculations easier. We then consider the case when
f (x) is continuous and nonnegative. Later in the chapter, we relax some of these restrictions and develop
techniques that apply in more general cases.

Sigma (Summation) Notation

As mentioned, we will use shapes of known area to approximate the area of an irregular region bounded by
curves. This process often requires adding up long strings of numbers. To make it easier to write down these
lengthy sums, we look at some new notation here, called sigma notation (also known as summation
notation). The Greek capital letter , sigma, is used to express long sums of values in a compact form. For
example, if we want to add all the integers from 1 to 20 without sigma notation, we have to write
Equation:

         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20.

We could probably skip writing a couple of terms and write
Equation:

                                                                                        1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +  + 19 + 20,

which is better, but still cumbersome. With sigma notation, we write this sum as
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                              20

                                                                                                                         i,

                                                                                                                                                                            i=1

which is much more compact.

Typically, sigma notation is presented in the form
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                              n

                                                                                                                         ai

                                                                                                                                                                           i=1
where ai describes the terms to be added, and the i is called the index. Each term is evaluated, then we sum
all the values, beginning with the value when i = 1 and ending with the value when i = n. For example, an

                                                        7

expression like  si is interpreted as s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6 + s7. Note that the index is used only to

                                                     i=2

keep track of the terms to be added; it does not factor into the calculation of the sum itself. The index is
therefore called a dummy variable. We can use any letter we like for the index. Typically, mathematicians use
i, j, k, m, and n for indices.

Let's try a couple of examples of using sigma notation.

Example:

b. Write the sum in sigma notation:

    Equation:

                                            1+                      +      +      +              .

                                                                 4     9      16         25

Solution:

                                                              i

                                            3

                                                                 = 363.

b. The denominator of each term is a perfect square. Using sigma notation, this sum can be written

                 5  1

    as                    .
                    i2
              i=1

A few more formulas for frequently found functions simplify the summation process further. These are
shown in the next rule, for sums and powers of integers, and we use them in the next set of examples.

Approximating Area

Now that we have the necessary notation, we return to the problem at hand: approximating the area under a
curve. Let f (x) be a continuous, nonnegative function defined on the closed interval [a, b]. We want to
approximate the area A bounded by f (x) above, the x-axis below, the line x = a on the left, and the line
x = b on the right ([link]).

  An area (shaded region) bounded by the curve
f (x) at top, the x-axis at bottom, the line x = a to

         the left, and the line x = b at right.

How do we approximate the area under this curve? The approach is a geometric one. By dividing a region

into many small shapes that have known area formulas, we can sum these areas and obtain a reasonable

estimate of the true area. We begin by dividing the interval [a, b] into n subintervals of equal width,  b-a . We
                                                                                                            n

do this by selecting equally spaced points x0, x1, x2,..., xn with x0 = a, xn = b, and

Equation:

                         xi - xi-1 =                   b-a
                                                           n

for i = 1, 2, 3,..., n.

We denote the width of each subinterval with the notation x, so x =  b-a   and
                                                                        n

Equation:

                         xi = x0 + ix
for i = 1, 2, 3,..., n. This notion of dividing an interval [a, b] into subintervals by selecting points from
within the interval is used quite often in approximating the area under a curve, so let's define some relevant
terminology.

Note:
Definition
A set of points P = {xi} for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n with a = x0 < x1 < x2 <  < xn = b, which divides the
interval [a, b] into subintervals of the form [x0, x1], [x1, x2],..., [xn-1, xn] is called a partition of [a, b]. If
the subintervals all have the same width, the set of points forms a regular partition of the interval [a, b].

We can use this regular partition as the basis of a method for estimating the area under the curve. We next
examine two methods: the left-endpoint approximation and the right-endpoint approximation.

Note:
Rule: Left-Endpoint Approximation
On each subinterval [xi-1, xi] (for i = 1, 2, 3,..., n), construct a rectangle with width x and height equal
to f (xi-1), which is the function value at the left endpoint of the subinterval. Then the area of this rectangle
is f (xi-1)x. Adding the areas of all these rectangles, we get an approximate value for A ([link]). We use
the notation Ln to denote that this is a left-endpoint approximation of A using n subintervals.
Equation:

                                                           A  Ln = f (x0 )x + f (x1 )x +  + f (xn-1 )x

                                                                                                                                    n

                                                                                   =  f (xi-1 )x

                                                                                                                                 i=1

      In the left-endpoint approximation of area under a
   curve, the height of each rectangle is determined by the

         function value at the left of each subinterval.
The second method for approximating area under a curve is the right-endpoint approximation. It is almost
the same as the left-endpoint approximation, but now the heights of the rectangles are determined by the
function values at the right of each subinterval.

Note:
Rule: Right-Endpoint Approximation
Construct a rectangle on each subinterval [xi-1, xi], only this time the height of the rectangle is determined
by the function value f (xi) at the right endpoint of the subinterval. Then, the area of each rectangle is
f (xi)x and the approximation for A is given by
Equation:

                                                             A  Rn = f (x1 )x + f (x2 )x +  + f (xn )x

                                                                                                                                       n

                                                                                      =  f (xi )x.

                                                                                                                                    i=1

The notation Rn indicates this is a right-endpoint approximation for A ([link]).

     In the right-endpoint approximation of area under a
   curve, the height of each rectangle is determined by the

     function value at the right of each subinterval. Note
    that the right-endpoint approximation differs from the

              left-endpoint approximation in [link].

The graphs in [link] represent the curve f (x) = 2 x . 2 In graph (a) we divide the region represented by the
interval [0, 3] into six subintervals, each of width 0.5. Thus, x = 0.5. We then form six rectangles by
drawing vertical lines perpendicular to xi-1, the left endpoint of each subinterval. We determine the height
of each rectangle by calculating f (xi-1) for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The intervals are
[0, 0.5], [0.5, 1], [1, 1.5], [1.5, 2], [2, 2.5], [2.5, 3]. We find the area of each rectangle by multiplying the
height by the width. Then, the sum of the rectangular areas approximates the area between f (x) and the x-
axis. When the left endpoints are used to calculate height, we have a left-endpoint approximation. Thus,
Equation:
A  L6               6

       =  f (xi-1 )x = f (x0 )x + f (x1 )x + f (x2 )x + f (x3 )x + f (x4 )x + f (x5 )x

                 i=1

       = f (0)0.5 + f (0.5)0.5 + f (1)0.5 + f (1.5)0.5 + f (2)0.5 + f (2.5)0.5

       = (0)0.5 + (0.125)0.5 + (0.5)0.5 + (1.125)0.5 + (2)0.5 + (3.125)0.5

       = 0 + 0.0625 + 0.25 + 0.5625 + 1 + 1.5625

       = 3.4375.

Methods of approximating the area under a curve by using (a) the left endpoints
                               and (b) the right endpoints.

In [link](b), we draw vertical lines perpendicular to xi such that xi is the right endpoint of each subinterval,
and calculate f (xi) for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We multiply each f (xi) by x to find the rectangular areas, and
then add them. This is a right-endpoint approximation of the area under f (x). Thus,
Equation:

A  R6               6

       =  f (xi )x = f (x1 )x + f (x2 )x + f (x3 )x + f (x4 )x + f (x5 )x + f (x6 )x

                 i=1

       = f (0.5)0.5 + f (1)0.5 + f (1.5)0.5 + f (2)0.5 + f (2.5)0.5 + f (3)0.5

       = (0.125)0.5 + (0.5)0.5 + (1.125)0.5 + (2)0.5 + (3.125)0.5 + (4.5)0.5

       = 0.0625 + 0.25 + 0.5625 + 1 + 1.5625 + 2.25

       = 5.6875.

   Approximating the Area Under a Curve
Use both left-endpoint and right-endpoint approximations to approximate the area under the curve of
f (x) = x2 on the interval [0, 2]; use n = 4.

Solution:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 (2-0)

First, divide the interval [0, 2] into n equal subintervals. Using n = 4, x = 4 = 0.5. This is the
width of each rectangle. The intervals [0, 0.5], [0.5, 1], [1, 1.5], [1.5, 2] are shown in [link]. Using a
left-endpoint approximation, the heights are f (0) = 0, f (0.5) = 0.25, f (1) = 1, f (1.5) = 2.25.

Then,
Equation:

                      L4        = f (x0 )x + f (x1 )x + f (x2 )x + f (x3 )x
                                = 0 (0.5) + 0.25 (0.5) + 1 (0.5) + 2.25 (0.5)

                                = 1.75.

The graph shows the left-endpoint approximation of

           the  area  under  f  (x)  =       2  from  0  to  2.

                                        x

The right-endpoint approximation is shown in [link]. The intervals are the same, x = 0.5, but now
use the right endpoint to calculate the height of the rectangles. We have
Equation:

                      R4        = f (x1 )x + f (x2 )x + f (x3 )x + f (x4 )x
                                = 0.25 (0.5) + 1 (0.5) + 2.25 (0.5) + 4 (0.5)

                                = 3.75.
       The graph shows the right-endpoint approximation of
                the area under f (x) = x2 from 0 to 2.

   The left-endpoint approximation is 1.75; the right-endpoint approximation is 3.75.

   The left-endpoint approximation is 0.7595. The right-endpoint approximation is 0.6345. See the below
   [link].

Hint
Follow the solving strategy in [link] step-by-step.

Looking at [link] and the graphs in [link], we can see that when we use a small number of intervals, neither
the left-endpoint approximation nor the right-endpoint approximation is a particularly accurate estimate of
the area under the curve. However, it seems logical that if we increase the number of points in our partition,
our estimate of A will improve. We will have more rectangles, but each rectangle will be thinner, so we will
be able to fit the rectangles to the curve more precisely.
We can demonstrate the improved approximation obtained through smaller intervals with an example. Let's
explore the idea of increasing n, first in a left-endpoint approximation with four rectangles, then eight
rectangles, and finally 32 rectangles. Then, let's do the same thing in a right-endpoint approximation, using
the same sets of intervals, of the same curved region. [link] shows the area of the region under the curve
f (x) = (x - 1) + 4 3 on the interval [0, 2] using a left-endpoint approximation where n = 4. The width of
each rectangle is
Equation:

The area is approximated by the summed areas of the rectangles, or
Equation:

    L4  = f (0) (0.5) + f (0.5) (0.5) + f (1) (0.5) + f (1.5)0.5
        = 7.5.

With a left-endpoint approximation and dividing the
region from a to b into four equal intervals, the area
under the curve is approximately equal to the sum of

               the areas of the rectangles.

[link] shows the same curve divided into eight subintervals. Comparing the graph with four rectangles in
[link] with this graph with eight rectangles, we can see there appears to be less white space under the curve
when n = 8. This white space is area under the curve we are unable to include using our approximation. The
area of the rectangles is
Equation:

L8  = f (0)(0.25) + f (0.25) (0.25) + f (0.5) (0.25) + f (0.75) (0.25)
     +f (1) (0.25) + f (1.25) (0.25) + f (1.5) (0.25) + f (1.75) (0.25)

    = 7.75.
 The region under the curve is divided into n = 8
rectangular areas of equal width for a left-endpoint

                     approximation.

The graph in [link] shows the same function with 32 rectangles inscribed under the curve. There appears to
be little white space left. The area occupied by the rectangles is
Equation:

L 32  = f (0) (0.0625) + f (0.0625) (0.0625) + f (0.125) (0.0625) +  + f (1.9375) (0.0625)
      = 7.9375.

Here, 32 rectangles are inscribed under the curve for a
               left-endpoint approximation.

We can carry out a similar process for the right-endpoint approximation method. A right-endpoint
approximation of the same curve, using four rectangles ([link]), yields an area
Equation:

      R4  = f (0.5) (0.5) + f (1) (0.5) + f (1.5) (0.5) + f (2) (0.5)
          = 8.5.
Now we divide the area under the curve into four equal
    subintervals for a right-endpoint approximation.

Dividing the region over the interval [0, 2] into eight rectangles results in x =  2-0   = 0.25. The graph is
                                                                                      8

shown in [link]. The area is

Equation:

           R8  = f (0.25) (0.25) + f (0.5) (0.25) + f (0.75) (0.25) + f (1) (0.25)
                +f (1.25) (0.25) + f (1.5) (0.25) + f (1.75) (0.25) + f (2) (0.25)

               = 8.25.

   Here we use right-endpoint approximation for a region
              divided into eight equal subintervals.

Last, the right-endpoint approximation with n = 32 is close to the actual area ([link]). The area is
approximately
Equation:
R 32    = f (0.0625) (0.0625) + f (0.125) (0.0625) + f (0.1875) (0.0625) +  + f (2) (0.0625)
        = 8.0625.

    The region is divided into 32 equal subintervals for a
                  right-endpoint approximation.

Based on these figures and calculations, it appears we are on the right track; the rectangles appear to
approximate the area under the curve better as n gets larger. Furthermore, as n increases, both the left-
endpoint and right-endpoint approximations appear to approach an area of 8 square units. [link] shows a
numerical comparison of the left- and right-endpoint methods. The idea that the approximations of the area
under the curve get better and better as n gets larger and larger is very important, and we now explore this
idea in more detail.

Converging Values of Left- and Right-Endpoint Approximations as n Increases

Forming Riemann Sums

So far we have been using rectangles to approximate the area under a curve. The heights of these rectangles
have been determined by evaluating the function at either the right or left endpoints of the subinterval
[xi-1, xi]. In reality, there is no reason to restrict evaluation of the function to one of these two points only.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *

We could evaluate the function at any point ci in the subinterval [xi-1, xi], and use f (xi ) as the height of
our rectangle. This gives us an estimate for the area of the form
Equation:

                                 n
                                                           *

           A   f (xi )x.

                              i=1

A sum of this form is called a Riemann sum, named for the 19th-century mathematician Bernhard Riemann,
who developed the idea.

for f (x) as

Recall that with the left- and right-endpoint approximations, the estimates seem to get better and better as n
get larger and larger. The same thing happens with Riemann sums. Riemann sums give better approximations
for larger values of n. We are now ready to define the area under a curve in terms of Riemann sums.

See a graphical demonstration of the construction of a Riemann sum.

Some subtleties here are worth discussing. First, note that taking the limit of a sum is a little different from
taking the limit of a function f (x) as x goes to infinity. Limits of sums are discussed in detail in the chapter
on Sequences and Series; however, for now we can assume that the computational techniques we used to
compute limits of functions can also be used to calculate limits of sums.
Second, we must consider what to do if the expression converges to different limits for different choices of

          *

{xi }. Fortunately, this does not happen. Although the proof is beyond the scope of this text, it can be shown

                                                                                                                                                                                                                           n

We look at some examples shortly. But, before we do, let's take a moment and talk about some specific

choices for {xi }. Although any choice for {xi } gives us an estimate of the area under the curve, we don't

necessarily know whether that estimate is too high (overestimate) or too low (underestimate). If it is

important     to  know    whether           our    estimate      is  high  or  low,        we         can  select  our  value                                                                           for     *            to  guarantee     one

                                                                                                                           *

way, then the Riemann sum  f (xi )x is called an upper sum. Similarly, if we want an underestimate,

                                              i=1

                          *                                                                *
we can choose {xi } so that for i = 1, 2, 3,..., n, f (xi ) is the minimum function value on the interval

[xi-1, xi]. In this case, the associated Riemann sum is called a lower sum. Note that if f (x) is either

increasing or decreasing throughout the interval [a, b], then the maximum and minimum values of the

function occur at the endpoints of the subintervals, so the upper and lower sums are just the same as the left-
and right-endpoint approximations.

Exercise:

   Problem:
   Finding Lower and Upper Sums

   Find a lower sum for f (x) = 10 - x2 on [1, 2]; let n = 4 subintervals.

   Solution:

   With n = 4 over the interval [1, 2], x =                            1   .  We           can    list  the  intervals  as
                                                                       4

   [1, 1.25], [1.25, 1.5], [1.5, 1.75], [1.75, 2]. Because the function is decreasing over the interval [1, 2],

   [link] shows that a lower sum is obtained by using the right endpoints.
The  graph  of  f  (x)  =                   10  -       2  is  set  up  for  a  right-

endpoint approximation of the area bounded by the

curve and the x-axis on [1, 2], and it shows a lower

                                            sum.

The Riemann sum is

                                            = 0.25 [10 - (1.25) + 10 - (1.5) + 10 - (1.75) + 10 - (2) ]

                                            = 0.25 [8.4375 + 7.75 + 6.9375 + 6]

                                            = 7.28.

The area of 7.28 is a lower sum and an underestimate.

Hint
f (x) is decreasing on [1, 2], so the maximum function values occur at the left endpoints of the subintervals.

   Find a lower sum for f (x) = sin x over the interval [a, b] = [0, 2 ]  ; let n = 6.
   Solution:
   Let's first look at the graph in [link] to get a better idea of the area of interest.

            The graph of y = sin x is divided into six regions: x = 6 = 12 . /2 

The intervals are [0, ]  , [  , ]  , [  , ]  , [  , ]  , [  , ] 5 , and [ 5 , ]  . Note that f (x) = sin x is

The use of sigma (summation) notation of the form  ai is useful for expressing long sums of values

                                                                 i=1

in compact form.

For a continuous function defined over an interval [a, b], the process of dividing the interval into n equal

parts, extending a rectangle to the graph of the function, calculating the areas of the series of rectangles,

and then summing the areas yields an approximation of the area of that region.

The width of each rectangle is x =            b-a

                                                      .

Riemann sums are expressions of the form  f (xi )x, and can be used to estimate the area under

                                                                                                                                                i=1

the curve y = f (x). Left- and right-endpoint approximations are special kinds of Riemann sums where

                                                      *

the values of {xi } are chosen to be the left or right endpoints of the subintervals, respectively.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   *

Riemann sums allow for much flexibility in choosing the set of points {xi } at which the function is
evaluated, often with an eye to obtaining a lower sum or an upper sum.

   Problem:

   Explain why, if f (a)  0 and f is increasing on [a, b], that the left endpoint estimate is a lower bound
   for the area below the graph of f on [a, b].

   Solution:

   If [c, d] is a subinterval of [a, b] under one of the left-endpoint sum rectangles, then the area of the
   rectangle contributing to the left-endpoint estimate is f (c) (d - c). But, f (c)  f (x) for c  x  d,
   so the area under the graph of f between c and d is f (c) (d - c) plus the area below the graph of f but
   above the horizontal line segment at height f (c), which is positive. As this is true for each left-endpoint
   sum interval, it follows that the left Riemann sum is less than or equal to the area below the graph of f
   on [a, b].

                                                                                                                                                                                                         *

                                                                                                A = lim  f (xi )x.

                                                                                                                                                         n
                                                                                                                                                                            i=1

However, this definition came with restrictions. We required f (x) to be continuous and nonnegative.
Unfortunately, real-world problems don't always meet these restrictions. In this section, we look at how to
apply the concept of the area under the curve to a broader set of functions through the use of the definite
integral.

Definition and Notation

The definite integral generalizes the concept of the area under a curve. We lift the requirements that f (x) be
continuous and nonnegative, and define the definite integral as follows.

Note:
Definition
If f (x) is a function defined on an interval [a, b], the definite integral of f from a to b is given by
Equation:

   b  n

           *

 f (x)dx = lim  f (xi )x,

                                                    n

a     i=1

provided the limit exists. If this limit exists, the function f (x) is said to be integrable on [a, b], or is an
integrable function.

The integral symbol in the previous definition should look familiar. We have seen similar notation in the
chapter on Applications of Derivatives, where we used the indefinite integral symbol (without the a and b
above and below) to represent an antiderivative. Although the notation for indefinite integrals may look
similar to the notation for a definite integral, they are not the same. A definite integral is a number. An
indefinite integral is a family of functions. Later in this chapter we examine how these concepts are related.
However, close attention should always be paid to notation so we know whether we're working with a
definite integral or an indefinite integral.

Integral notation goes back to the late seventeenth century and is one of the contributions of Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz, who is often considered to be the codiscoverer of calculus, along with Isaac Newton. The
integration symbol  is an elongated S, suggesting sigma or summation. On a definite integral, above and
below the summation symbol are the boundaries of the interval, [a, b]. The numbers a and b are x-values and
are called the limits of integration; specifically, a is the lower limit and b is the upper limit. To clarify, we
are using the word limit in two different ways in the context of the definite integral. First, we talk about the
limit of a sum as n  . Second, the boundaries of the region are called the limits of integration.

We call the function f (x) the integrand, and the dx indicates that f (x) is a function with respect to x,
called the variable of integration. Note that, like the index in a sum, the variable of integration is a dummy
variable, and has no impact on the computation of the integral. We could use any variable we like as the
variable of integration:
Equation:

                              b                    b                    b

                            f (x)dx =  f (t)dt =  f (u)du

                           a                    a                  a

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   *

Previously, we discussed the fact that if f (x) is continuous on [a, b], then the limit lim  f (xi )x
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      i=1

exists and is unique. This leads to the following theorem, which we state without proof.

Note:
Continuous Functions Are Integrable
If f (x) is continuous on [a, b], then f is integrable on [a, b].

Functions that are not continuous on [a, b] may still be integrable, depending on the nature of the
discontinuities. For example, functions with a finite number of jump discontinuities on a closed interval are
integrable.

It is also worth noting here that we have retained the use of a regular partition in the Riemann sums. This
restriction is not strictly necessary. Any partition can be used to form a Riemann sum. However, if a
nonregular partition is used to define the definite integral, it is not sufficient to take the limit as the number
of subintervals goes to infinity. Instead, we must take the limit as the width of the largest subinterval goes to
zero. This introduces a little more complex notation in our limits and makes the calculations more difficult
without really gaining much additional insight, so we stick with regular partitions for the Riemann sums.

Since we are using a right-endpoint approximation to generate Riemann sums, for each i, we need to
calculate the function value at the right endpoint of the interval [xi-1, xi]. The right endpoint of the
interval is xi, and since P is a regular partition,

Evaluating Definite Integrals

Evaluating definite integrals this way can be quite tedious because of the complexity of the calculations.
Later in this chapter we develop techniques for evaluating definite integrals without taking limits of Riemann
sums. However, for now, we can rely on the fact that definite integrals represent the area under the curve,
and we can evaluate definite integrals by using geometric formulas to calculate that area. We do this to
confirm that definite integrals do, indeed, represent areas, so we can then discuss what to do in the case of a
curve of a function dropping below the x-axis.

Area and the Definite Integral
When we defined the definite integral, we lifted the requirement that f (x) be nonnegative. But how do we
interpret "the area under the curve" when f (x) is negative?

Net Signed Area

Let  us  return  to  the  Riemann    sum.           Consider,   for  example,  the        function  f  (x)  =    2  -           2  (shown    in  [link])  on

                                                                                                                       2x

                                                                                                                                                    *

the interval [0, 2]. Use n = 8 and choose {xi } as the left endpoint of each interval. Construct a rectangle on

each  subinterval    of   height     *              and  width  x.   When      *             is  positive,  the  product              *      represents

                                  f  (x          )                         f  (x          )                               f  (x          )x

                                              i                                        i                                              i

                                                                *                                                                  *
the area of the rectangle, as before. When f (xi ) is negative, however, the product f (xi )x represents the

negative of the area of the rectangle. The Riemann sum then becomes

Equation:

    8
                              *

 f (x )x = (Area of rectangles above the x-axis) - (Area of rectangles below the x-axis)

                              i

 i=1

        For a function that is partly
    negative, the Riemann sum is the
   area of the rectangles above the x-
    axis less the area of the rectangles

              below the x-axis.

Taking the limit as n  , the Riemann sum approaches the area between the curve above the x-axis and
the x-axis, less the area between the curve below the x-axis and the x-axis, as shown in [link]. Then,
Equation:
                   2                                                   n

            f (x)dx                      = lim  f (ci )x

                0                                 n
                                                                    i=1

                                         = A1 - A2.

The quantity A1 - A2 is called the net signed area.

In the limit, the definite integral

equals area A1 less area A2, or the
          net signed area.

Notice that net signed area can be positive, negative, or zero. If the area above the x-axis is larger, the net
signed area is positive. If the area below the x-axis is larger, the net signed area is negative. If the areas
above and below the x-axis are equal, the net signed area is zero.

   Problem:
   Finding the Net Signed Area

   Find the net signed area between the curve of the function f (x) = 2x and the x-axis over the interval

     [-3, 3].

Solution:

The function produces a straight line that forms two triangles: one from x = -3 to x = 0 and the other

from x = 0 to x = 3 ([link]). Using the geometric formula for the area of a triangle, A =  bh, 1 the

                                                                                           2

area of triangle A1, above the axis, is
Equation:
A1 =  1
          3 (6) = 9,

      2

where 3 is the base and 2 (3) = 6 is the height. The area of triangle A2, below the axis, is
Equation:

A2 =  1
          (3) (6) = 9,

      2

where 3 is the base and 6 is the height. Thus, the net area is
Equation:

                                                                              2xdx = A1 - A2 = 9 - 9 = 0.

                                                                                                                  -3

         The area above the curve and
        below the x-axis equals the area
       below the curve and above the x-

                        axis.

   Analysis
   If A1 is the area above the x-axis and A2 is the area below the x-axis, then the net area is A1 - A2.
   Since the areas of the two triangles are equal, the net area is zero.

Total Area

One application of the definite integral is finding displacement when given a velocity function. If v (t)
represents the velocity of an object as a function of time, then the area under the curve tells us how far the
object is from its original position. This is a very important application of the definite integral, and we
examine it in more detail later in the chapter. For now, we're just going to look at some basics to get a feel
for how this works by studying constant velocities.

When velocity is a constant, the area under the curve is just velocity times time. This idea is already very
familiar. If a car travels away from its starting position in a straight line at a speed of 75 mph for 2 hours,
then it is 150 mi away from its original position ([link]). Using integral notation, we have
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                2

                                                                                                            75dt = 150.

                                                                                                                                                             0
The area under the curve v (t) = 75 tells us how far the car is
              from its starting point at a given time.

In the context of displacement, net signed area allows us to take direction into account. If a car travels
straight north at a speed of 60 mph for 2 hours, it is 120 mi north of its starting position. If the car then turns
around and travels south at a speed of 40 mph for 3 hours, it will be back at it starting position ([link]).
Again, using integral notation, we have
Equation:

                                        2     5

 60dt +  -40dt                                   = 120 - 120
                                                 = 0.
0                                          2

In this case the displacement is zero.
The area above the axis and the area below the axis are
           equal, so the net signed area is zero.

Suppose we want to know how far the car travels overall, regardless of direction. In this case, we want to
know the area between the curve and the x-axis, regardless of whether that area is above or below the axis.
This is called the total area.

Graphically, it is easiest to think of calculating total area by adding the areas above the axis and the areas
below the axis (rather than subtracting the areas below the axis, as we did with net signed area). To
accomplish this mathematically, we use the absolute value function. Thus, the total distance traveled by the
car is
Equation:

   2     5                                               2                                    5

 |60|dt +  |-40|dt  =                                       60dt +                               40dt

0     2                           0                                                        2

                    = 120 + 120

                    = 240.

Bringing these ideas together formally, we state the following definitions.

Note:
Definition
Let f (x) be an integrable function defined on an interval [a, b]. Let A1 represent the area between f (x) and
the x-axis that lies above the axis and let A2 represent the area between f (x) and the x-axis that lies below
the axis. Then, the net signed area between f (x) and the x-axis is given by
Equation:

                                               b

                                                  f (x)dx = A1 - A2 .

                                            a

The total area between f (x) and the x-axis is given by
Equation:

                                               b

                                                  |f (x)|dx = A1 + A2 .

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Finding the Total Area

   Find the total area between f (x) = x - 2 and the x-axis over the interval [0, 6].

   Solution:

   Calculate the x-intercept as (2, 0) (set y = 0, solve for x). To find the total area, take the area below the
   x-axis over the subinterval [0, 2] and add it to the area above the x-axis on the subinterval [2, 6] ([link]).

The total area between the line and
the x-axis over [0, 6] is A2 plus A1.

We have
Equation:

                   6

            |(x - 2)|dx = A2 + A1 .

                0

Then, using the formula for the area of a triangle, we obtain
Equation:
                                                 1        1

                                           A2 =     bh =     22 = 2

                                                 2        2

Equation:                                        1        1

The total area, then, is  A1 =                      bh =      4  4 = 8.
Equation:
                                                 2        2

                                           A1 + A2 = 8 + 2 = 10.

Properties of the Definite Integral

The properties of indefinite integrals apply to definite integrals as well. Definite integrals also have

Comparison Properties of Integrals

A picture can sometimes tell us more about a function than the results of computations. Comparing functions
by their graphs as well as by their algebraic expressions can often give new insight into the process of
integration. Intuitively, we might say that if a function f (x) is above another function g (x), then the area
between f (x) and the x-axis is greater than the area between g (x) and the x-axis. This is true depending on
the interval over which the comparison is made. The properties of definite integrals are valid whether
a < b, a = b, or a > b. The following properties, however, concern only the case a  b, and are used when
we want to compare the sizes of integrals.

   Problem:
   Comparing Two Functions over a Given Interval

   Compare f (x) = 1 + x2 and g (x) = 1 + x over the interval [0, 1].

   Solution:

   Graphing these functions is necessary to understand how they compare over the interval [0, 1]. Initially,
   when graphed on a graphing calculator, f (x) appears to be above g (x) everywhere. However, on the
   interval [0, 1], the graphs appear to be on top of each other. We need to zoom in to see that, on the
   interval [0, 1], g (x) is above f (x). The two functions intersect at x = 0 and x = 1 ([link]).

 (a) The function f (x) appears above the function g (x) except
over the interval [0, 1] (b) Viewing the same graph with a greater

                    zoom shows this more clearly.

We can see from the graph that over the interval [0, 1], g (x)  f (x). Comparing the integrals over the

        1            1

specified interval [0, 1], we also see that  g (x)dx   f (x)dx ([link]). The thin, red-shaded area

     0            0

shows just how much difference there is between these two integrals over the interval [0, 1].
       (a) The graph shows that over the interval [0, 1], g (x)  f (x),
        where equality holds only at the endpoints of the interval. (b)
        Viewing the same graph with a greater zoom shows this more

                                         clearly.

Average Value of a Function

We often need to find the average of a set of numbers, such as an average test grade. Suppose you received
the following test scores in your algebra class: 89, 90, 56, 78, 100, and 69. Your semester grade is your
average of test scores and you want to know what grade to expect. We can find the average by adding all the
scores and dividing by the number of scores. In this case, there are six test scores. Thus,
Equation:

                                  89 + 90 + 56 + 78 + 100 + 69                        482

                                                                            =                80.33.

                                                           6                          6

Therefore, your average test grade is approximately 80.33, which translates to a B- at most schools.

Suppose, however, that we have a function v (t) that gives us the speed of an object at any time t, and we
want to find the object's average speed. The function v (t) takes on an infinite number of values, so we can't
use the process just described. Fortunately, we can use a definite integral to find the average value of a
function such as this.

Let f (x) be continuous over the interval [a, b] and let [a, b] be divided into n subintervals of width

                                                           *                                                                           *

                                           i

the function may then be approximated as
Equation:

                                                        *             *               *

                                                                                                                                    ,

                                                                         n

which is basically the same expression used to calculate the average of discrete values.

dividing by a fraction. To divide by a fraction, invert the denominator and multiply. Thus, an approximate
value for the average value of the function is given by
Equation:

This is a Riemann sum. Then, to get the exact average value, take the limit as n goes to infinity. Thus, the
average value of a function is given by
Equation:

   Problem:
   Finding the Average Value of a Linear Function

   Find the average value of f (x) = x + 1 over the interval [0, 5].

   Solution:
First, graph the function on the stated interval, as shown in [link].

       The graph shows the area under the function
                 f (x) = x + 1 over [0, 5].

The region is a trapezoid lying on its side, so we can use the area formula for a trapezoid

A=  1  h  (a  +  b),  where  h  represents  height,        and  a  and  b  represent  the  two  parallel  sides.  Then,

                                 x + 1dx                        = h (a + b)

                                     0                                     2

                                                                   2

                                                                =  35   .

Thus the average value of the function is
Equation:

Key Concepts

      The definite integral can be used to calculate net signed area, which is the area above the x-axis less the
      area below the x-axis. Net signed area can be positive, negative, or zero.
      The component parts of the definite integral are the integrand, the variable of integration, and the limits
      of integration.
      Continuous functions on a closed interval are integrable. Functions that are not continuous may still be
      integrable, depending on the nature of the discontinuities.
      The properties of definite integrals can be used to evaluate integrals.
      The area under the curve of many functions can be calculated using geometric formulas.
      The average value of a function can be calculated using definite integrals.

Glossary

average value of a function
      (or fave) the average value of a function on an interval can be found by calculating the definite integral
      of the function and dividing that value by the length of the interval

definite integral
      a primary operation of calculus; the area between the curve and the x-axis over a given interval is a
      definite integral

integrable function
      a function is integrable if the limit defining the integral exists; in other words, if the limit of the
      Riemann sums as n goes to infinity exists
integrand
      the function to the right of the integration symbol; the integrand includes the function being integrated

limits of integration
      these values appear near the top and bottom of the integral sign and define the interval over which the
      function should be integrated

net signed area
      the area between a function and the x-axis such that the area below the x-axis is subtracted from the area
      above the x-axis; the result is the same as the definite integral of the function

total area
      total area between a function and the x-axis is calculated by adding the area above the x-axis and the
      area below the x-axis; the result is the same as the definite integral of the absolute value of the function

variable of integration
      indicates which variable you are integrating with respect to; if it is x, then the function in the integrand
      is followed by dx
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

      Describe the meaning of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals.
      State the meaning of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1.
      Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1, to evaluate derivatives of integrals.
      State the meaning of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2.
      Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, to evaluate definite integrals.
      Explain the relationship between differentiation and integration.

In the previous two sections, we looked at the definite integral and its relationship to the area
under the curve of a function. Unfortunately, so far, the only tools we have available to
calculate the value of a definite integral are geometric area formulas and limits of Riemann
sums, and both approaches are extremely cumbersome. In this section we look at some more
powerful and useful techniques for evaluating definite integrals.

These new techniques rely on the relationship between differentiation and integration. This
relationship was discovered and explored by both Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz (among others) during the late 1600s and early 1700s, and it is codified in what we
now call the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which has two parts that we examine in
this section. Its very name indicates how central this theorem is to the entire development of
calculus.

Note:
Isaac Newton's contributions to mathematics and physics changed the way we look at the
world. The relationships he discovered, codified as Newton's laws and the law of universal
gravitation, are still taught as foundational material in physics today, and his calculus has
spawned entire fields of mathematics. To learn more, read a brief biography of Newton with
multimedia clips.

Before we get to this crucial theorem, however, let's examine another important theorem, the
Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, which is needed to prove the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus.

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals states that a continuous function on a closed interval
takes on its average value at the same point in that interval. The theorem guarantees that if
f (x) is continuous, a point c exists in an interval [a, b] such that the value of the function at c
is equal to the average value of f (x) over [a, b]. We state this theorem mathematically with
the help of the formula for the average value of a function that we presented at the end of the
preceding section.
Note:
The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals
If f (x) is continuous over an interval [a, b], then there is at least one point c  [a, b] such
that
Equation:

                            f (c) =       1          b
                                     b-a
                                              f (x)dx.

                                                  a

This formula can also be stated as
Equation:

                                    b

                             f (x)dx = f (c) (b - a).

                                 a

Proof

Since f (x) is continuous on [a, b], by the extreme value theorem (see Maxima and Minima),
it assumes minimum and maximum values--m and M, respectively--on [a, b]. Then, for all x
in [a, b], we have m  f (x)  M. Therefore, by the comparison theorem (see The Definite
Integral), we have
Equation:

                                                                                                                                               b

                                                              m (b - a)   f (x)dx  M (b - a).

                                                                                                                                           a

Dividing by b - a gives us
Equation:

                            m            1          b
                                    b-a
                                             f (x)dx  M .

                                                 a

                                             b

Since b-a  f (x)dx 1 is a number between m and M, and since f (x) is continuous and

                                         a

assumes the values m and M over [a, b], by the Intermediate Value Theorem (see Continuity),
there is a number c over [a, b] such that

Equation:

                            f (c) =       1          b
                                     b-a
                                              f (x)dx,

                                                  a
and the proof is complete.

   Problem:
   Finding the Average Value of a Function

   Find the average value of the function f (x) = 8 - 2x over the interval [0, 4] and find c
   such that f (c) equals the average value of the function over [0, 4].

Solution:

The formula states the mean value of f (x) is given by
Equation:

                                 1          4
                            4-0
                                     (8 - 2x)dx.

                                         0

We can see in [link] that the function represents a straight line and forms a right triangle
bounded by the x- and y-axes. The area of the triangle is A = 2 (base) (height). 1 We
have
Equation:

                            A=      1
                                        (4) (8) = 16.

                                    2

The average value is found by multiplying the area by 1/ (4 - 0). Thus, the average
value of the function is
Equation:

                                                                                          1
                                                                                              (16) = 4.

                                                                                          4

Set the average value equal to f (c) and solve for c.
Equation:

                                                                                      8 - 2c = 4
                                                                                                    c=2
At c = 2, f (2) = 4.

By the Mean Value Theorem, the
continuous function f (x) takes on
its average value at c at least once

       over a closed interval.

         0

[0, 3].

Solution:

We are looking for the value of c such that
Equation:

                              f (c) =       1                 3             1
                                       3-0                               2      (9) = 3.

                                                       x dx =               3

                                                           0

Replacing f (c) with c2, we have
Equation:

                                             c     2  =3

                                             c        = ±3.

Since -3 is outside the interval, take only the positive value. Thus, c = 3 ([link]).
           Over the interval [0, 3], the
        function f (x) = x2 takes on its

            average value at c = 3.

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1: Integrals and Antiderivatives

As mentioned earlier, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is an extremely powerful
theorem that establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration, and gives us
a way to evaluate definite integrals without using Riemann sums or calculating areas. The
theorem is comprised of two parts, the first of which, the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, Part 1, is stated here. Part 1 establishes the relationship between differentiation and
integration.

Note:
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1
If f (x) is continuous over an interval [a, b], and the function F (x) is defined by
Equation:

                                                                       x

                                 F (x) =                                  f (t)dt,

                                                                    a

then F (x) = f (x) over [a, b].

Before we delve into the proof, a couple of subtleties are worth mentioning here. First, a
comment on the notation. Note that we have defined a function, F (x), as the definite integral
of another function, f (t), from the point a to the point x. At first glance, this is confusing,
because we have said several times that a definite integral is a number, and here it looks like
it's a function. The key here is to notice that for any particular value of x, the definite integral
is a number. So the function F (x) returns a number (the value of the definite integral) for
each value of x.

Second, it is worth commenting on some of the key implications of this theorem. There is a
reason it is called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Not only does it establish a
relationship between integration and differentiation, but also it guarantees that any integrable
function has an antiderivative. Specifically, it guarantees that any continuous function has an
antiderivative.

Proof

Applying the definition of the derivative, we have
Equation:
                               = lim        F (x+h)-F (x)
                                                             h
                      F (x)             h0

                                                              x+h                                           x

                               = lim        1                      f (t)dt -                                   f (t)dt]

                                        h0     [                                                         a

                                            h

                                                           a

                                                              x+h                                           a

                               = lim        1                      f (t)dt +                                   f (t)dt]

                                        h0     [                                                         x

                                            h

                                                           a

                                                        x+h

                                            1

                               = lim        h                    f (t)dt.

                                                                            x+h

Looking carefully at this last expression, we see                  1             f (t)dt is just the average value of
                                                                   h

                                                                         x

the function f (x) over the interval [x, x + h]. Therefore, by [link], there is some number c in

[x, x + h] such that

Equation:

                                                   x+h

                                   1

                                                        f (x)dx = f (c).

                                   hx

In addition, since c is between x and x + h, c approaches x as h approaches zero. Also, since

f (x) is continuous, we have limf (c) = limf (c) = f (x). Putting all these pieces together,

                               h0              cx

we have

Equation:

                                                                         x+h

                                            = lim             1               f (x)dx

                               F (x)                          h    

                                               h0                     x

                                            = lim f (c)

                                                     h0

                                            = f (x),

and the proof is complete.

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2: The Evaluation Theorem

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, is perhaps the most important theorem in
calculus. After tireless efforts by mathematicians for approximately 500 years, new techniques
emerged that provided scientists with the necessary tools to explain many phenomena. Using
calculus, astronomers could finally determine distances in space and map planetary orbits.
Everyday financial problems such as calculating marginal costs or predicting total profit could
now be handled with simplicity and accuracy. Engineers could calculate the bending strength
of materials or the three-dimensional motion of objects. Our view of the world was forever
changed with calculus.

After finding approximate areas by adding the areas of n rectangles, the application of this
theorem is straightforward by comparison. It almost seems too simple that the area of an entire
curved region can be calculated by just evaluating an antiderivative at the first and last
endpoints of an interval.

Note:
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2
If f is continuous over the interval [a, b] and F (x) is any antiderivative of f (x), then
Equation:

                                                                                                                 b

                                                                          f (x)dx = F (b) - F (a).

                                                                                                             a

We  often  see  the  notation     b                to  denote  the  expression                                 We  use  this  vertical

                               F  (x)|                                                     F  (b)  -  F  (a).

bar and associated limits a and b to indicate that we should evaluate the function F (x) at the
upper limit (in this case, b), and subtract the value of the function F (x) evaluated at the lower
limit (in this case, a).

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 (also known as the evaluation theorem)
states that if we can find an antiderivative for the integrand, then we can evaluate the definite
integral by evaluating the antiderivative at the endpoints of the interval and subtracting.

Proof

Let P = {xi}, i = 0, 1,..., n be a regular partition of [a, b]. Then, we can write
Equation:

F (b) - F (a) = F (xn ) - F (x0 )

  = [F (xn ) - F (xn-1 )] + [F (xn-1 ) - F (xn-2 )] + ... + [F (x1 ) - F (x0 )]

     n

  =       [F (xi ) - F (xi-1 )].

     i=1

Now, we know F is an antiderivative of f over [a, b], so by the Mean Value Theorem (see The
Mean Value Theorem) for i = 0, 1,..., n we can find ci in [xi-1, xi] such that
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                 

                                             F (xi ) - F (xi-1 ) = F (ci ) (xi - xi-1 ) = f (ci )x.

Then, substituting into the previous equation, we have
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                      n

                                                                        F (b) - F (a) =  f (ci )x.

                                                                                                                                                                   i=1

Taking the limit of both sides as n  , we obtain
Equation:

          F (b) - F (a)                                          n

                                   = lim  f (ci )x

                                            n
                                                              i=1

                                                     b

                                   =  f (x)dx.

Analysis

Notice that we did not include the "+ C" term when we wrote the antiderivative. The
reason is that, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, any
antiderivative works. So, for convenience, we chose the antiderivative with C = 0. If
we had chosen another antiderivative, the constant term would have canceled out. This
always happens when evaluating a definite integral.
The region of the area we just calculated is depicted in [link]. Note that the region
between the curve and the x-axis is all below the x-axis. Area is always positive, but a
definite integral can still produce a negative number (a net signed area). For example, if
this were a profit function, a negative number indicates the company is operating at a
loss over the given interval.

   The evaluation of a definite
 integral can produce a negative
value, even though area is always

               positive.

   Problem:
   A Roller-Skating Race

   James and Kathy are racing on roller skates. They race along a long, straight track, and
   whoever has gone the farthest after 5 sec wins a prize. If James can skate at a velocity of
   f (t) = 5 + 2t ft/sec and Kathy can skate at a velocity of g (t) = 10 + cos ( 2 t)  ft/sec,
   who is going to win the race?

   Solution:

   We need to integrate both functions over the interval [0, 5] and see which value is bigger.
   For James, we want to calculate
   Equation:

                                                                                                                                          5

                                                                                            (5 + 2t)dt.

                                                                                                                                      0

Using the power rule, we have
Equation:

                             5                                            25

                      (5 + 2t)dt        = (5t + t )

                          0                                                         0

                                        = (25 + 25) = 50.

Thus, James has skated 50 ft after 5 sec. Turning now to Kathy, we want to calculate
Equation:
                                              10 + cos ( t)dt.                          5
                                                                                                                      
                                                0                                                2

We know sin t is an antiderivative of cos t, so it is reasonable to expect that an

antiderivative of cos ( 2 t)  would involve sin ( 2 t).  However, when we differentiate

sin (  t), we get      cos     (     t)  as  a  result                                  of  the  chain  rule,  so  we  have       to  account  for  this
                 2  2             2

additional coefficient when we integrate. We obtain

                         0     10 + cos ( t)dt                                          = (10t + sin ( t))

                                                                    2                                          2          0

                                                                                                    2                  2

                                                                                        = (50 + ) - (0 - sin 0)
                                                                                                                       

                                                                                         50.6.

Kathy has skated approximately 50.6 ft after 5 sec. Kathy wins, but not by much!

Note:
A Parachutist in Free Fall
     Skydivers can adjust the velocity of their dive by changing the position of their body
                              during the free fall. (credit: Jeremy T. Lock)

Julie is an avid skydiver. She has more than 300 jumps under her belt and has mastered the
art of making adjustments to her body position in the air to control how fast she falls. If she
arches her back and points her belly toward the ground, she reaches a terminal velocity of
approximately 120 mph (176 ft/sec). If, instead, she orients her body with her head straight
down, she falls faster, reaching a terminal velocity of 150 mph (220 ft/sec).
Since Julie will be moving (falling) in a downward direction, we assume the downward
direction is positive to simplify our calculations. Julie executes her jumps from an altitude of
12,500 ft. After she exits the aircraft, she immediately starts falling at a velocity given by
v (t) = 32t. She continues to accelerate according to this velocity function until she reaches
terminal velocity. After she reaches terminal velocity, her speed remains constant until she
pulls her ripcord and slows down to land.
On her first jump of the day, Julie orients herself in the slower "belly down" position
(terminal velocity is 176 ft/sec). Using this information, answer the following questions.

   1. How long after she exits the aircraft does Julie reach terminal velocity?
   2. Based on your answer to question 1, set up an expression involving one or more

      integrals that represents the distance Julie falls after 30 sec.
   3. If Julie pulls her ripcord at an altitude of 3000 ft, how long does she spend in a free fall?
   4. Julie pulls her ripcord at 3000 ft. It takes 5 sec for her parachute to open completely and
      for her to slow down, during which time she falls another 400 ft. After her canopy is
      fully open, her speed is reduced to 16 ft/sec. Find the total time Julie spends in the air,
      from the time she leaves the airplane until the time her feet touch the ground.
      On Julie's second jump of the day, she decides she wants to fall a little faster and orients
      herself in the "head down" position. Her terminal velocity in this position is 220 ft/sec.
      Answer these questions based on this velocity:

   5. How long does it take Julie to reach terminal velocity in this case?
   6. Before pulling her ripcord, Julie reorients her body in the "belly down" position so she is

      not moving quite as fast when her parachute opens. If she begins this maneuver at an
      altitude of 4000 ft, how long does she spend in a free fall before beginning the
      reorientation?
      Some jumpers wear "wingsuits" (see [link]). These suits have fabric panels between the
      arms and legs and allow the wearer to glide around in a free fall, much like a flying
      squirrel. (Indeed, the suits are sometimes called "flying squirrel suits.") When wearing
      these suits, terminal velocity can be reduced to about 30 mph (44 ft/sec), allowing the
      wearers a much longer time in the air. Wingsuit flyers still use parachutes to land;
      although the vertical velocities are within the margin of safety, horizontal velocities can
      exceed 70 mph, much too fast to land safely.

   The fabric panels on the arms and legs of a wingsuit work to reduce the vertical velocity
                            of a skydiver's fall. (credit: Richard Schneider)

Answer the following question based on the velocity in a wingsuit.
   7. If Julie dons a wingsuit before her third jump of the day, and she pulls her ripcord at an
      altitude of 3000 ft, how long does she get to spend gliding around in the air?

Key Concepts

      The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals states that for a continuous function over a closed
      interval, there is a value c such that f (c) equals the average value of the function. See
      [link].
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1 shows the relationship between the
      derivative and the integral. See [link].
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 is a formula for evaluating a definite
      integral in terms of an antiderivative of its integrand. The total area under a curve can be
      found using this formula. See [link].

   Problem:

Suppose the rate of gasoline consumption in the United States can be modeled by a

sinusoidal function of the form (11.21 - cos ( t ))                       ×          9  gal/mo.

a. What is the average monthly consumption, and for which values of t is the rate at
  time t equal to the average rate?

b. What is the number of gallons of gasoline consumed in the United States in a year?
c. Write an integral that expresses the average monthly U.S. gas consumption during

  the part of the year between the beginning of April (t = 3) and the end of

t = 9. b. Total consumption is the average rate times duration:

Kepler's first law states that the planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one
focus. The closest point of a planetary orbit to the Sun is called the perihelion (for Earth,

Earth, it currently occurs around July 4). Kepler's second law states that planets sweep

      Apply the basic integration formulas.
      Explain the significance of the net change theorem.
      Use the net change theorem to solve applied problems.
      Apply the integrals of odd and even functions.

In this section, we use some basic integration formulas studied previously to solve some key applied problems. It
is important to note that these formulas are presented in terms of indefinite integrals. Although definite and
indefinite integrals are closely related, there are some key differences to keep in mind. A definite integral is either
a number (when the limits of integration are constants) or a single function (when one or both of the limits of
integration are variables). An indefinite integral represents a family of functions, all of which differ by a constant.
As you become more familiar with integration, you will get a feel for when to use definite integrals and when to
use indefinite integrals. You will naturally select the correct approach for a given problem without thinking too
much about it. However, until these concepts are cemented in your mind, think carefully about whether you need
a definite integral or an indefinite integral and make sure you are using the proper notation based on your choice.

Basic Integration Formulas

Recall the integration formulas given in the table in Antiderivatives and the rule on properties of definite
integrals. Let's look at a few examples of how to apply these rules.

The Net Change Theorem

The net change theorem considers the integral of a rate of change. It says that when a quantity changes, the new
value equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change of that quantity. The formula can be expressed
in two ways. The second is more familiar; it is simply the definite integral.

Note:
Net Change Theorem
The new value of a changing quantity equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change:
Equation:

                                                                   b

F (b) = F (a) +                                                       F (x)dx

                                                                a

   or

b

 F (x)dx = F (b) - F (a).

     a

Subtracting F (a) from both sides of the first equation yields the second equation. Since they are equivalent
formulas, which one we use depends on the application.

The significance of the net change theorem lies in the results. Net change can be applied to area, distance, and
volume, to name only a few applications. Net change accounts for negative quantities automatically without
having to write more than one integral. To illustrate, let's apply the net change theorem to a velocity function in
which the result is displacement.

We looked at a simple example of this in The Definite Integral. Suppose a car is moving due north (the positive
direction) at 40 mph between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., then the car moves south at 30 mph between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.
We can graph this motion as shown in [link].
The graph shows speed versus
time for the given motion of a

                car.

Just as we did before, we can use definite integrals to calculate the net displacement as well as the total distance
traveled. The net displacement is given by
Equation:

                                        5                              4                                    5

                                 v(t)dt               =                   40dt +                               -30dt

                                     2                              2                                    4

                                                      = 80 - 30

                                                      = 50.

Thus, at 5 p.m. the car is 50 mi north of its starting position. The total distance traveled is given by
Equation:

                                         5                                                                           5
                                                                          4

                                            |v(t)|dt  =                   40dt +                                        30dt

                                      2                             2                                      4

                                                      = 80 + 30

                                                      = 110.

Therefore, between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., the car traveled a total of 110 mi.

To summarize, net displacement may include both positive and negative values. In other words, the velocity
function accounts for both forward distance and backward distance. To find net displacement, integrate the
velocity function over the interval. Total distance traveled, on the other hand, is always positive. To find the total
distance traveled by an object, regardless of direction, we need to integrate the absolute value of the velocity
function.

Finding Net DisplacementGiven a velocity function v (t) = 3t - 5 (in meters per second) for a particle in motion from time t = 0 to

   Problem:
   Finding the Total Distance Traveled
Use [link] to find the total distance traveled by a particle according to the velocity function v (t) = 3t - 5
m/sec over a time interval [0, 3].

Solution:

The total distance traveled includes both the positive and the negative values. Therefore, we must integrate
the absolute value of the velocity function to find the total distance traveled.

To continue with the example, use two integrals to find the total distance. First, find the t-intercept of the
function, since that is where the division of the interval occurs. Set the equation equal to zero and solve for
t. Thus,
Equation:

                                                                          3t - 5 = 0

                                                                                     t=                       3

interval.  Over  [  5  ,  3],  the  function       is  positive,          so      |v(t)|  =                   v(t).  Thus,                 we  have

   Chapter Opener: Iceboats
(credit: modification of work by Carter Brown, Flickr)

As we saw at the beginning of the chapter, top iceboat racers ([link]) can attain speeds of up to five times
the wind speed. Andrew is an intermediate iceboater, though, so he attains speeds equal to only twice the
wind speed. Suppose Andrew takes his iceboat out one morning when a light 5-mph breeze has been
blowing all morning. As Andrew gets his iceboat set up, though, the wind begins to pick up. During his first
half hour of iceboating, the wind speed increases according to the function v (t) = 20t + 5. For the second
half hour of Andrew's outing, the wind remains steady at 15 mph. In other words, the wind speed is given
by
Equation:

                       20t + 5  f or                                                    1
v (t) = {                       f or
                                                        0t

                                                               t  1.

Recalling that Andrew's iceboat travels at twice the wind speed, and assuming he moves in a straight line
away from his starting point, how far is Andrew from his starting point after 1 hour?

Solution:

To figure out how far Andrew has traveled, we need to integrate his velocity, which is twice the wind speed.
Then

                                                1

Distance =  2v (t)dt.

Suppose that, instead of remaining steady during the second half hour of Andrew's outing, the wind starts to
die down according to the function v (t) = -10t + 15. In other words, the wind speed is given by
Equation:

                                    20t + 5            f or                                  1

   Under these conditions, how far from his starting point is Andrew after 1 hour?
   Solution:
   17.5 mi
Hint
Don't forget that Andrew's iceboat moves twice as fast as the wind.

Integrating Even and Odd Functions

We saw in Functions and Graphs that an even function is a function in which f (-x) = f (x) for all x in the
domain--that is, the graph of the curve is unchanged when x is replaced with -x. The graphs of even functions
are symmetric about the y-axis. An odd function is one in which f (-x) = -f (x) for all x in the domain, and the
graph of the function is symmetric about the origin.

Integrals of even functions, when the limits of integration are from -a to a, involve two equal areas, because they
are symmetric about the y-axis. Integrals of odd functions, when the limits of integration are similarly [-a, a],
evaluate to zero because the areas above and below the x-axis are equal.

axis. We have to zoom in to this graph by a huge amount to see the region. Graph (b) shows the region
above the curve and below the x-axis. The signed area of this region is negative. Both views illustrate the
symmetry about the y-axis of an even function. We have

Key Concepts

      The net change theorem states that when a quantity changes, the final value equals the initial value plus the
      integral of the rate of change. Net change can be a positive number, a negative number, or zero.
      The area under an even function over a symmetric interval can be calculated by doubling the area over the
      positive x-axis. For an odd function, the integral over a symmetric interval equals zero, because half the area
      is negative.

Problem:

For a given motor vehicle, the maximum achievable deceleration from braking is approximately 7 m/sec2 on
dry concrete. On wet asphalt, it is approximately 2.5 m/sec2. Given that 1 mph corresponds to 0.447 m/sec,

find the total distance that a car travels in meters on dry concrete after the brakes are applied until it comes to

a complete stop if the initial velocity is 67 mph (30 m/sec) or if the initial braking velocity is 56 mph (25

m/sec). Find the corresponding distances if the surface is slippery wet asphalt.

Solution:

   In dry conditions, with initial velocity v0 = 30 m/s, D = 64.3 and, if v0 = 25, D = 44.64. In wet
   conditions, if v0 = 30, and D = 180 and if v0 = 25, D = 125.

net change theorem
      if we know the rate of change of a quantity, the net change theorem says the future quantity is equal to the
      initial quantity plus the integral of the rate of change of the quantity
Substitution

    Use substitution to evaluate indefinite integrals.
    Use substitution to evaluate definite integrals.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gave us a method to evaluate integrals without
using Riemann sums. The drawback of this method, though, is that we must be able to
find an antiderivative, and this is not always easy. In this section we examine a
technique, called integration by substitution, to help us find antiderivatives.
Specifically, this method helps us find antiderivatives when the integrand is the result
of a chain-rule derivative.

At first, the approach to the substitution procedure may not appear very obvious.

However, it is primarily a visual task--that is, the integrand shows you what to do; it

is a matter of recognizing the form of the function. So, what are we supposed to see?

We  are  looking  for  an  integrand  of  the  form  f  [g                      For  example,  in  the

                                                            (x)]g (x)dx.

integral  (x2 - 3) 2xdx, 3 we have f(x) = x3, g(x) = x2 - 3, and g(x) = 2x.

Then,
Equation:

                                                            23

                           f [g (x)]g (x) = (x - 3) (2x),

and we see that our integrand is in the correct form.

The method is called substitution because we substitute part of the integrand with the
variable u and part of the integrand with du. It is also referred to as change of
variables because we are changing variables to obtain an expression that is easier to
work with for applying the integration rules.

Note:
Substitution with Indefinite Integrals
Let u = g (x), , where g(x) is continuous over an interval, let f (x) be continuous
over the corresponding range of g, and let F (x) be an antiderivative of f(x). Then,
Equation:
                                                

        f [g (x)]g (x)dx =  f (u)du

                                                         = F (u) + C
                                                         = F (g (x)) + C.

Proof

Let f, g, u, and F be as specified in the theorem. Then
Equation:

        d              = F  (g (x))g (x)
                       = f [g (x)]g (x).
             F (g(x))

       dx

Integrating both sides with respect to x, we see that
Equation:

                                                                                                                         

                                                         f [g (x)]g (x)dx = F (g (x)) + C.

If we now substitute u = g (x), and du = g(x)dx, we get
Equation:

                                                                                                                       

                                                       f [g (x)]g (x)dx =  f (u)du

                                                                                                         = F (u) + C
                                                                                                         = F (g (x)) + C.



Returning to the problem we looked at originally, we let u = x2 - 3 and then
du = 2xdx. Rewrite the integral in terms of u:
Equation:

             3

       2                                                 3
        (x - 3) (2xdx) =  u du.

          u            du
Using the power rule for integrals, we have
Equation:

                                          3    u4

                                       u du =       + C.

                                               4

Substitute the original expression for x back into the solution:
Equation:

                                   4  +C =            24  + C.

                              u              (x - 3)
                               4                       4

We can generalize the procedure in the following Problem-Solving Strategy.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Integration by Substitution

1. Look carefully at the integrand and select an expression g (x) within the

    integrand to set equal to u. Let's select g (x). such that g(x) is also part of the

    integrand.

2.  Substitute  u  =  g  (x)  and  du  =            into  the  integral.

                                          g (x)dx.

3. We should now be able to evaluate the integral with respect to u. If the integral

    can't be evaluated we need to go back and select a different expression to use as

    u.

4. Evaluate the integral in terms of u.

5. Write the result in terms of x and the expression g (x).

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Using Substitution to Find an Antiderivative

   Use substitution to find the antiderivative of  6x(3x2 + 4) dx. 4
Solution:

The first step is to choose an expression for u. We choose u = 3x2 + 4. because
then du = 6xdx. , and we already have du in the integrand. Write the integral in
terms of u:
Equation:

                                                                                                               24 4

                                                         6x(3x + 4) dx =  u du.

Remember that du is the derivative of the expression chosen for u, regardless of
what is inside the integrand. Now we can evaluate the integral with respect to u:
Equation:

                         4        u5

            u du               =      +C

                                  5

                               =               25  + C.

                                  (3x +4)
                                            5

Analysis

We can check our answer by taking the derivative of the result of integration. We
should obtain the integrand. Picking a value for C of 1, we let
y = ( 1 3x2 + 4) + 1. 5 We have

                 5

Equation:

           y=  12 5
                   (3x + 4) + 1,

               5

so
Equation:

                            1         24

           y = ( )5(3x + 4) 6x
                            5

                                            24

             = 6x(3x + 4) .

This is exactly the expression we started with inside the integrand.

                 3

Hint

Let u = x3 - 3.

Sometimes we need to adjust the constants in our integral if they don't match up
exactly with the expressions we are substituting.

   Problem:
   Using Substitution with Alteration

   Use substitution to find the antiderivative of  zz2 - 5dz.

Solution:

Rewrite the integral as  z(z - 5) dz. 2 1/2 Let u = z2 - 5 and du = 2z dz.

Now we have a problem because du = 2z dz and the original expression has

only z dz. We have to alter our expression for du or the integral in u will be

twice as large as it should be. If we multiply both sides of the du equation by   1

                                                                                     .

                                                                                  2

we can solve this problem. Thus,

Equation:
                                   u = z2 - 5

                                du  = 2z dz

                             1                 1

                                du  = (2z)dz = z dz.

                             2                 2

Write the integral in terms of u, but pull the  1     outside the integration symbol:
                                                2

We know the derivative of cos t is -sin t, so we set u = cos t. Then
du = -sin tdt. Substituting into the integral, we have

Hint

Use the process from [link] to solve the problem.

Sometimes we need to manipulate an integral in ways that are more complicated than
just multiplying or dividing by a constant. We need to eliminate all the expressions
within the integrand that are in terms of the original variable. When we are done, u
should be the only variable in the integrand. In some cases, this means solving for the
original variable in terms of u. This technique should become clear in the next
example.

   Finding an Antiderivative Using u-Substitution

                                                   x - 1

Solution:

If we let u = x - 1, then du = dx. But this does not account for the x in the
numerator of the integrand. We need to express x in terms of u. If u = x - 1,
then x = u + 1. Now we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:
Equation:

                                    dx =                 du

Substitution for Definite Integrals

Substitution can be used with definite integrals, too. However, using substitution to
evaluate a definite integral requires a change to the limits of integration. If we change
variables in the integrand, the limits of integration change as well.

Note:

Substitution with Definite Integrals

Let  u  =  g  (x)  and  let        be    continuous  over              an  interval   [a,  b],  and  let               f  be  continuous

                             g

over the range of u = g (x). Then,

Equation:

                                      b                                         g(b)

                                                                                      f (u)du.

                              f (g(x))g (x)dx = 

                                   a                                         g(a)

Although we will not formally prove this theorem, we justify it with some calculations
here. From the substitution rule for indefinite integrals, if F (x) is an antiderivative of
f (x), we have
Equation:

                                                                                                                          

                                                         f (g(x))g (x)dx = F (g(x)) + C.

Then

                         f [g (x)]g (x)dx
                                                                                                                  x=a

                                                                       = F (u)|

                                                   6

To adjust the limits of integration, note that when x = 0, u = 1 + 2 (0) = 1,

Hint

Use the process from [link] to solve the problem.

Substitution may be only one of the techniques needed to evaluate a definite integral.
All of the properties and rules of integration apply independently, and trigonometric
functions may need to be rewritten using a trigonometric identity before we can apply
substitution. Also, we have the option of replacing the original expression for u after
we find the antiderivative, which means that we do not have to change the limits of
integration. These two approaches are shown in [link].

                                                                                                      /2

Use substitution to evaluate  cos  d. 2

                                                                                                  0

Solution:

Let us first use a trigonometric identity to rewrite the integral. The trig identity

cos2 = 2 1+cos2 allows us to rewrite the integral as
Equation:

                            /2               /2

                                2                                                                         1 + cos 2
                                                                                                                                    d.
                                cos d = 
                                                                                                                    2
                         0                0
Then,
Equation:

                     /2     1 + cos 2                      /2        1     1

                         (             )d    =                   ( + cos 2)d

                  0              2              0                    2     2

                                                                 /2                            /2

                                             =  1                    d +                           cos 2d.

                                                                                            0

                                                2

                                                              0

We can evaluate the first integral as it is, but we need to make a substitution to

evaluate the second integral. Let u = 2. Then, du = 2d, or                                          1 du = d. Also,

                                                                                                    2

when  = 0, u = 0, and when  = /2, u = . Expressing the second integral

in terms of u, we have

Equation:

              /2            1    /2                              /2           11

Key Concepts

      Substitution is a technique that simplifies the integration of functions that are the
      result of a chain-rule derivative. The term `substitution' refers to changing
      variables or substituting the variable u and du for appropriate expressions in the
      integrand.
      When using substitution for a definite integral, we also have to change the limits
      of integration.

and logarithmic functions.

Integrals of Exponential Functions

The exponential function is perhaps the most efficient function in terms of

the  operations  of  calculus.  The  exponential    function,  y  =      x  is  its  own

                                                                     e,

Find the antiderivative of the exponential function e-x.

Solution:

Use substitution, setting u = -x, and then du = -1dx. Multiply the
du equation by -1, so you now have -du = dx. Then,
Equation:

                              -x                                  u

Hint

Let u equal the exponent on e.

A common mistake when dealing with exponential expressions is treating
the exponent on e the same way we treat exponents in polynomial
expressions. We cannot use the power rule for the exponent on e. This can
be especially confusing when we have both exponentials and polynomials
in the same expression, as in the previous checkpoint. In these cases, we
should always double-check to make sure we're using the right rules for the
functions we're integrating.

Using Substitution with an Exponential Function

Use substitution to evaluate the indefinite integral  3x2e2x dx. 3

Solution:

Here we choose to let u equal the expression in the exponent on e. Let

u = 2x3 and du = 6x2dx. . Again, du is off by a constant multiplier;
the original function contains a factor of 3x2, not 6x2. Multiply both

sides of the equation by  1  so that the integrand in u equals the
                          2

integrand in x. Thus,

Equation:

                             2 2x  3  1        u

                        3x e dx =         e du.

                                      2

Integrate the expression in u and then substitute the original
expression in x back into the u integral:

Hint

Let u = x4.

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, exponential functions are
used in many real-life applications. The number e is often associated with
compounded or accelerating growth, as we have seen in earlier sections
about the derivative. Although the derivative represents a rate of change or
a growth rate, the integral represents the total change or the total growth.
Let's look at an example in which integration of an exponential function
solves a common business application.

A price-demand function tells us the relationship between the quantity of a
product demanded and the price of the product. In general, price decreases
as quantity demanded increases. The marginal price-demand function is the
derivative of the price-demand function and it tells us how fast the price
changes at a given level of production. These functions are used in business
to determine the price-elasticity of demand, and to help companies
determine whether changing production levels would be profitable.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Finding a Price-Demand Equation

Find the price-demand equation for a particular brand of toothpaste at

a supermarket chain when the demand is 50 tubes per week at $2.35

per   tube,  given       that  the  marginal  price--demand  function,          for  x

                                                                        p (x),

number of tubes per week, is given as

Equation:
p(x) = -0.015e          -0.01x  .

If the supermarket chain sells 100 tubes per week, what price should it
set?

Solution:

To find the price-demand equation, integrate the marginal price-
demand function. First find the antiderivative, then look at the
particulars. Thus,
Equation:

                             -0.01x

p (x)            =  -0.015e          dx

                                -0.01x

                 = -0.015  e            dx.

Using substitution, let u = -0.01x and du = -0.01dx. Then, divide
both sides of the du equation by -0.01. This gives
Equation:

-0.015               u                                     u

                 e du   = 1.5  e du

 -0.01

                        = 1.5eu + C

                        = 1.5e  -0.01x  + C.

The next step is to solve for C. We know that when the price is $2.35
per tube, the demand is 50 tubes per week. This means
Equation:

                                                p (50) = 1.5e-0.01(50) + C
                                                                    = 2.35.
Now, just solve for C:
Equation:

                                                                                                                                             -0.5

                                                       C = 2.35 - 1.5e
                                                                = 2.35 - 0.91
                                                                = 1.44.

Thus,
Equation:

                                       -0.01x

               p (x) = 1.5e                    + 1.44.

If the supermarket sells 100 tubes of toothpaste per week, the price
would be
Equation:

               -0.01(100)                           -1
p(100) = 1.5e              + 1.44 = 1.5e + 1.44  1.99.

The supermarket should charge $1.99 per tube if it is selling 100 tubes
per week.

                                 1

Solution:
Again, substitution is the method to use. Let u = 1 - x, so
du = -1dx or -du = dx. Then  e1-xdx = -  eudu. Next,
change the limits of integration. Using the equation u = 1 - x, we
have
Equation:

                                                          u = 1 - (1) = 0

bacteria per hour. If a culture starts with 10,000 bacteria, find a

       = 100 + [100e                                                   0.02t 10

Evaluating a Definite Integral Using Substitution

                                                                             2     1/x

Evaluate the definite integral using substitution:                              e

                                                                                        dx.

                                                                                x  2

                                                                          1

Solution:

This problem requires some rewriting to simplify applying the
properties. First, rewrite the exponent on e as a power of x, then bring
the x2 in the denominator up to the numerator using a negative
exponent. We have
Equation:

                                 2      1/x          2
                                                              x-1 -2
                                    e

                              1              dx =  e x dx.

                                    x  2

                                                  1

Let  u  =       -1  the  exponent         on  e.  Then

           x,

Equation:

                                        du                            -2
                                    -du
                                                  = -x dx

                                                                -2

                                                  = x dx.

Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now
reads
Equation:

                                                                                                                       u

                                                                    -  e du.

Next, change the limits of integration:
Equation:
                                                 -1

                               u = (1)               =1

                                                 -1  1

                               u = (2)               =.

                                                                2

Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we
must multiply by -1 and interchange the limits. Thus,
Equation:

                               1/2                   1

                         -                    u  =                     u

                                      e du                         e du

                            1                        1/2

                                                 =e |

                                                                    1/2

                                                                            1/2

                                                 = e-e

                                                 = e - e.

Integrals Resulting in Inverse Trigonometric Functions

      Integrate functions resulting in inverse trigonometric functions

In this section we focus on integrals that result in inverse trigonometric
functions. We have worked with these functions before. Recall from
Functions and Graphs that trigonometric functions are not one-to-one unless
the domains are restricted. When working with inverses of trigonometric
functions, we always need to be careful to take these restrictions into
account. Also in Derivatives, we developed formulas for derivatives of
inverse trigonometric functions. The formulas developed there give rise
directly to integration formulas involving inverse trigonometric functions.

Integrals that Result in Inverse Sine Functions

Let us begin this last section of the chapter with the three formulas. Along
with these formulas, we use substitution to evaluate the integrals. We prove
the formula for the inverse sine integral.

Note:
Rule: Integration Formulas Resulting in Inverse Trigonometric Functions
The following integration formulas yield inverse trigonometric functions:

                                            uu2 - a2                        a                      a

Proof

Let  y       =            -1  x  .  Then    a sin y  =  x.  Now             let's           use   implicit  differentiation.

For - 2  y  2 , cos y  0.   Thus, applying the Pythagorean identity

          2  +  cos2 y        =     1,  we  have  cos y  =               1-            2           This  gives

                                                         =                        1

                                                                                         .

Integrals Resulting in Other Inverse Trigonometric Functions

There are six inverse trigonometric functions. However, only three
integration formulas are noted in the rule on integration formulas resulting
in inverse trigonometric functions because the remaining three are negative
versions of the ones we use. The only difference is whether the integrand is
positive or negative. Rather than memorizing three more formulas, if the
integrand is negative, simply factor out -1 and evaluate the integral using
one of the formulas already provided. To close this section, we examine one
more formula: the integral resulting in the inverse tangent function.

Exercise:

   Problem:
   Finding an Antiderivative Involving the Inverse Tangent Function

Find an antiderivative of   1
                                        dx.

                            1 + 4x2
Solution:

Comparing this problem with the formulas stated in the rule on
integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions, the
integrand looks similar to the formula for tan-1u + C. So we use
substitution, letting u = 2x, then du = 2dx and 1/2du = dx. Then,

we have
Equation:

      1            1                1                      1
           
                              du =                     -1                     -1
      2      1 + u2
                                        tan u + C =            tan (2x) + C.

Problem:

Use the substitution u = 2 cot x and the identity

1 + cot2x = csc2x to evaluate      dx

                                           . (Hint: Multiply the top
                                   1 + cos2 x

and bottom of the integrand by csc2x. )

Solution:

Using the hint, one has                             2                                    2

Set u = 2cot x. Then, du = -2csc2x and the integral is

   1           du      1  tan-1 u + C =   1 tan-1 (2cot x) + C.

If one uses the identity tan-1s + tan ( s ) -1 = 2 , 1  then this can also

be written 1 tan-1 ( ) tan x + C.

water levels in the lake vary considerably as a result of droughts and
varying water demands. Later in this chapter, we use definite integrals to
calculate the force exerted on the dam when the reservoir is full and we
examine how changing water levels affect that force (see [link]).

Hydrostatic force is only one of the many applications of definite integrals
we explore in this chapter. From geometric applications such as surface area
and volume, to physical applications such as mass and work, to growth and
decay models, definite integrals are a powerful tool to help us understand
and model the world around us.
Areas between Curves

      Find the area of a compound region.
      Determine the area of a region between two curves by integrating with respect to
      the dependent variable.

In Introduction to Integration, we developed the concept of the definite integral to
calculate the area below a curve on a given interval. In this section, we expand that idea
to calculate the area of more complex regions. We start by finding the area between two
curves that are functions of x, beginning with the simple case in which one function
value is always greater than the other. We then look at cases when the graphs of the
functions cross. Last, we consider how to calculate the area between two curves that are
functions of y.

Area of a Region between Two Curves

Let f(x) and g(x) be continuous functions over an interval [a, b] such that f(x)  g(x)
on [a, b]. We want to find the area between the graphs of the functions, as shown in the
following figure.

    The area between the
        graphs of two

     functions, f(x) and
    g(x), on the interval

                          [a, b].
As we did before, we are going to partition the interval on the x-axis and approximate

the area between the graphs of the functions with rectangles. So, for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n,

let P = {xi} be a regular partition of [a, b]. Then, for i = 1, 2,..., n, choose a point

*        [xi-1, xi], and on each interval [xi-1, xi] construct a rectangle that extends

x

vertically from g(xi ) to f(xi ). [link](a) shows the rectangles when xi is selected to be

the left endpoint of the interval and n = 10. [link](b) shows a representative rectangle in

detail.

        (a)We can approximate the area between the
        graphs of two functions, f(x) and g(x), with
        rectangles. (b) The area of a typical rectangle

               goes from one curve to the other.

                               *                            *
The height of each individual rectangle is f(xi ) - g(xi ) and the width of each rectangle

is x. Adding the areas of all the rectangles, we see that the area between the curves is

approximated by

Equation:

Areas of Compound Regions

So far, we have required f(x)  g(x) over the entire interval of interest, but what if we
want to look at regions bounded by the graphs of functions that cross one another? In
that case, we modify the process we just developed by using the absolute value function.

Note:
Finding the Area of a Region between Curves That Cross
Let f(x) and g(x) be continuous functions over an interval [a, b]. Let R denote the
region between the graphs of f(x) and g(x), and be bounded on the left and right by
the lines x = a and x = b, respectively. Then, the area of R is given by
Equation:

                                         b

           A =  |f (x) - g(x)|dx.

                                   a

In practice, applying this theorem requires us to break up the interval [a, b] and evaluate
several integrals, depending on which of the function values is greater over a given part
of the interval. We study this process in the following example.

Example:

   Problem:

   Finding the Area of a Complex Region
   Consider the region depicted in [link]. Find the area of R.

         Two integrals are
        required to calculate
      the area of this region.

   Solution:
   As with [link], we need to divide the interval into two pieces. The graphs of the
   functions intersect at x = 1 (set f(x) = g(x) and solve for x), so we evaluate two
   separate integrals: one over the interval [0, 1] and one over the interval [1, 2].
   Over the interval [0, 1], the region is bounded above by f(x) = x2 and below by
   the x-axis, so we have
   Equation:

Over the interval [1, 2], the region is bounded above by g(x) = 2 - x and below
by the x-axis, so we have
Equation:

                                          2

           A2 =                              (2 - x)dx = [2x -  x2        2      1

Adding these areas together, we obtain
Equation:

Regions Defined with Respect to y

In [link], we had to evaluate two separate integrals to calculate the area of the region.

However, there is another approach that requires only one integral. What if we treat the

curves as functions of y, instead of as functions of x? Review [link]. Note that the left

graph, shown in red, is represented by the function y = f(x) = x2. We could just as

easily solve this for x and represent the curve by the function x = v(y) = y. (Note

that  x  =  -y  is  also  a  valid  representation  of  the  function  y  =  f (x)  =       2  as  a  function

                                                                                       x

of y. However, based on the graph, it is clear we are interested in the positive square

root.) Similarly, the right graph is represented by the function y = g(x) = 2 - x, but

could just as easily be represented by the function x = u(y) = 2 - y. When the graphs

are represented as functions of y, we see the region is bounded on the left by the graph

of one function and on the right by the graph of the other function. Therefore, if we

integrate with respect to y, we need to evaluate one integral only. Let's develop a

formula for this type of integration.

Let u(y) and v(y) be continuous functions over an interval [c, d] such that u(y)  v(y)
for all y  [c, d]. We want to find the area between the graphs of the functions, as shown
in the following figure.

         We can find the area
between the graphs of two
functions, u(y) and v(y).

This time, we are going to partition the interval on the y-axis and use horizontal

rectangles to approximate the area between the functions. So, for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let

Finding the Area between Two Curves, Integrating along the y-axis
Let u(y) and v(y) be continuous functions such that u(y)  v(y) for all y  [c, d]. Let
R denote the region bounded on the right by the graph of u(y), on the left by the graph
of v(y), and above and below by the lines y = d and y = c, respectively. Then, the area
of R is given by
Equation:

   Problem:
   Integrating with Respect to y

   Let's revisit [link], only this time let's integrate with respect to y. Let R be the
   region depicted in [link]. Find the area of R by integrating with respect to y.
 The area of region R
can be calculated using
one integral only when
 the curves are treated

   as functions of y.

Solution:

We must first express the graphs as functions of y. As we saw at the beginning of
this section, the curve on the left can be represented by the function
x = v(y) = y, and the curve on the right can be represented by the function

x = u(y) = 2 - y.

Now we have to determine the limits of integration. The region is bounded below
by the x-axis, so the lower limit of integration is y = 0. The upper limit of
integration is determined by the point where the two graphs intersect, which is the
point (1, 1), so the upper limit of integration is y = 1. Thus, we have

[c, d] = [0, 1].

Calculating the area of the region, we get
Equation:

                             d

           A =  [u(y) - v(y)]dy

Key Concepts

      Just as definite integrals can be used to find the area under a curve, they can also be
      used to find the area between two curves.
      To find the area between two curves defined by functions, integrate the difference
      of the functions.
      If the graphs of the functions cross, or if the region is complex, use the absolute
      value of the difference of the functions. In this case, it may be necessary to evaluate
two or more integrals and add the results to find the area of the region.
Sometimes it can be easier to integrate with respect to y to find the area. The
principles are the same regardless of which variable is used as the variable of
integration.

Determining Volumes by Slicing

      Determine the volume of a solid by integrating a cross-section (the slicing method).
      Find the volume of a solid of revolution using the disk method.
      Find the volume of a solid of revolution with a cavity using the washer method.

In the preceding section, we used definite integrals to find the area between two curves. In this section,
we use definite integrals to find volumes of three-dimensional solids. We consider three approaches--
slicing, disks, and washers--for finding these volumes, depending on the characteristics of the solid.

Volume and the Slicing Method

Just as area is the numerical measure of a two-dimensional region, volume is the numerical measure of a

three-dimensional solid. Most of us have computed volumes of solids by using basic geometric formulas.

The volume of a rectangular solid, for example, can be computed by multiplying length, width, and

height: V = lwh. The formulas for the volume of a sphere (V = 4 r3), a cone (V = 1 r2h), and a
                                                                      3                    3

pyramid (V  =  1  Ah)  have  also  been  introduced.  Although  some  of  these  formulas  were  derived  using
               3

geometry alone, all these formulas can be obtained by using integration.

We can also calculate the volume of a cylinder. Although most of us think of a cylinder as having a
circular base, such as a soup can or a metal rod, in mathematics the word cylinder has a more general
meaning. To discuss cylinders in this more general context, we first need to define some vocabulary.

We define the cross-section of a solid to be the intersection of a plane with the solid. A cylinder is
defined as any solid that can be generated by translating a plane region along a line perpendicular to the
region, called the axis of the cylinder. Thus, all cross-sections perpendicular to the axis of a cylinder are
identical. The solid shown in [link] is an example of a cylinder with a noncircular base. To calculate the
volume of a cylinder, then, we simply multiply the area of the cross-section by the height of the cylinder:
V = A  h. In the case of a right circular cylinder (soup can), this becomes V = r2h.
                   Each cross-section of a particular cylinder is identical to the others.

If a solid does not have a constant cross-section (and it is not one of the other basic solids), we may not
have a formula for its volume. In this case, we can use a definite integral to calculate the volume of the
solid. We do this by slicing the solid into pieces, estimating the volume of each slice, and then adding
those estimated volumes together. The slices should all be parallel to one another, and when we put all
the slices together, we should get the whole solid. Consider, for example, the solid S shown in [link],
extending along the x-axis.

        A solid with a varying cross-section.

We want to divide S into slices perpendicular to the x-axis. As we see later in the chapter, there may be
times when we want to slice the solid in some other direction--say, with slices perpendicular to the y-
axis. The decision of which way to slice the solid is very important. If we make the wrong choice, the
computations can get quite messy. Later in the chapter, we examine some of these situations in detail and
look at how to decide which way to slice the solid. For the purposes of this section, however, we use
slices perpendicular to the x-axis.
Because the cross-sectional area is not constant, we let A (x) represent the area of the cross-section at
point x. Now let P = {x0, x1..., Xn} be a regular partition of [a, b], and for i = 1, 2,...n, let Si
represent the slice of S stretching from xi-1to xi. The following figure shows the sliced solid with

n = 3.
      The solid S has been divided into three
         slices perpendicular to the x-axis.

                                                                                                       *

Finally, for i = 1, 2,...n, let xi be an arbitrary point in [xi-1, xi]. Then the volume of slice Si can be

                                                                                               *

estimated by V (Si)  A (xi )x. Adding these approximations together, we see the volume of the
entire solid S can be approximated by

The technique we have just described is called the slicing method. To apply it, we use the following
strategy.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Finding Volumes by the Slicing Method

   1. Examine the solid and determine the shape of a cross-section of the solid. It is often helpful to draw
      a picture if one is not provided.

   2. Determine a formula for the area of the cross-section.
   3. Integrate the area formula over the appropriate interval to get the volume.
Recall that in this section, we assume the slices are perpendicular to the x-axis. Therefore, the area
formula is in terms of x and the limits of integration lie on the x-axis. However, the problem-solving
strategy shown here is valid regardless of how we choose to slice the solid.

   Problem:
   Deriving the Formula for the Volume of a Pyramid

We know from geometry that the formula for the volume of a pyramid is V = 3 Ah. 1 If the

pyramid has a square base, this becomes V  =  1      2  where    a  denotes  the  length  of  one  side  of  the
                                              3
                                                 a h,

base. We are going to use the slicing method to derive this formula.

Solution:

We want to apply the slicing method to a pyramid with a square base. To set up the integral,
consider the pyramid shown in [link], oriented along the x-axis.

(a) A pyramid with a square base is oriented along the x-axis. (b) A two-dimensional view of
                                   the pyramid is seen from the side.

We first want to determine the shape of a cross-section of the pyramid. We are know the base is a
square, so the cross-sections are squares as well (step 1). Now we want to determine a formula for
the area of one of these cross-sectional squares. Looking at [link](b), and using a proportion, since
these are similar triangles, we have
Equation:

           s                               x             ax

              =                                  or s =       .

           a                               h             h

Therefore, the area of one of the cross-sectional squares is
Equation:                                                      ax 2

                                                2

                                      A (x) = s = (      ) (step 2).

                                                      h

Then we find the volume of the pyramid by integrating from 0 to h (step 3):
Equation:

                                         h

                                                h                      2

Solids of Revolution

If a region in a plane is revolved around a line in that plane, the resulting solid is called a solid of
revolution, as shown in the following figure.
    (a) This is the region that is revolved around
   the x-axis. (b) As the region begins to revolve

       around the axis, it sweeps out a solid of
     revolution. (c) This is the solid that results

           when the revolution is complete.

Solids of revolution are common in mechanical applications, such as machine parts produced by a lathe.
We spend the rest of this section looking at solids of this type. The next example uses the slicing method
to calculate the volume of a solid of revolution.

   Problem:
   Using the Slicing Method to find the Volume of a Solid of Revolution
   Use the slicing method to find the volume of the solid of revolution bounded by the graphs of
   f (x) = x2 - 4x + 5, x = 1, and x = 4, and rotated about the x-axis.
   Solution:
   Using the problem-solving strategy, we first sketch the graph of the quadratic function over the
   interval [1, 4] as shown in the following figure.

      A region used to produce a solid
                 of revolution.

   Next, revolve the region around the x-axis, as shown in the following figure.
Two views, (a) and (b), of the solid of revolution produced by revolving the region in
                                     [link] about the x-axis.

Since the solid was formed by revolving the region around the x-axis, the cross-sections are circles
(step 1). The area of the cross-section, then, is the area of a circle, and the radius of the circle is
given by f (x). Use the formula for the area of the circle:
Equation:

                               2                      2        2                                                          2

      A (x) = r = [f (x)] = (x - 4x + 5) (step 2).

The volume, then, is (step 3)

The volume is 78/5.

   Solution:

           
           2

Hint
Use the problem-solving strategy presented earlier and follow [link] to help with step 2.

The Disk Method

When we use the slicing method with solids of revolution, it is often called the disk method because, for
solids of revolution, the slices used to over approximate the volume of the solid are disks. To see this,
consider the solid of revolution generated by revolving the region between the graph of the function
f (x) = (x - 1) + 1 2 and the x-axis over the interval [-1, 3] around the x-axis. The graph of the
function and a representative disk are shown in [link](a) and (b). The region of revolution and the
resulting solid are shown in [link](c) and (d).
(a) A thin rectangle for approximating the area under a curve. (b) A representative disk
formed by revolving the rectangle about the x-axis. (c) The region under the curve is

            revolved about the x-axis, resulting in (d) the solid of revolution.

We already used the formal Riemann sum development of the volume formula when we developed the
slicing method. We know that
Equation:

                          b

V =                          A (x)dx.

                       a
The only difference with the disk method is that we know the formula for the cross-sectional area ahead
of time; it is the area of a circle. This gives the following rule.

Note:
Rule: The Disk Method
Let f (x) be continuous and nonnegative. Define R as the region bounded above by the graph of f (x),
below by the x-axis, on the left by the line x = a, and on the right by the line x = b. Then, the volume
of the solid of revolution formed by revolving R around the x-axis is given by
Equation:

So far, our examples have all concerned regions revolved around the x-axis, but we can generate a solid
of revolution by revolving a plane region around any horizontal or vertical line. In the next example, we
look at a solid of revolution that has been generated by revolving a region around the y-axis. The
mechanics of the disk method are nearly the same as when the x-axis is the axis of revolution, but we
express the function in terms of y and we integrate with respect to y as well. This is summarized in the
following rule.

Note:
Rule: The Disk Method for Solids of Revolution around the y-axis
Let g (y) be continuous and nonnegative. Define Q as the region bounded on the right by the graph of
g (y), on the left by the y-axis, below by the line y = c, and above by the line y = d. Then, the volume
of the solid of revolution formed by revolving Q around the y-axis is given by
Equation:

The Washer Method

Some solids of revolution have cavities in the middle; they are not solid all the way to the axis of
revolution. Sometimes, this is just a result of the way the region of revolution is shaped with respect to
the axis of revolution. In other cases, cavities arise when the region of revolution is defined as the region
between the graphs of two functions. A third way this can happen is when an axis of revolution other
than the x-axis or y-axis is selected.

When the solid of revolution has a cavity in the middle, the slices used to approximate the volume are
not disks, but washers (disks with holes in the center). For example, consider the region bounded above
by the graph of the function f (x) = x and below by the graph of the function g (x) = 1 over the
interval [1, 4]. When this region is revolved around the x-axis, the result is a solid with a cavity in the
middle, and the slices are washers. The graph of the function and a representative washer are shown in
[link](a) and (b). The region of revolution and the resulting solid are shown in [link](c) and (d).

 disk formed by revolving the rectangle about the x-axis. (c) The region

                                      revolution.

The cross-sectional area, then, is the area of the outer circle less the area of the inner circle. In this case,

Note:

Rather than looking at an example of the washer method with the y-axis as the axis of revolution, we
now consider an example in which the axis of revolution is a line other than one of the two coordinate
axes. The same general method applies, but you may have to visualize just how to describe the cross-
sectional area of the volume.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   The Washer Method with a Different Axis of Revolution

   Find the volume of a solid of revolution formed by revolving the region bounded above by
   f (x) = 4 - x and below by the x-axis over the interval [0, 4] around the line y = -2.

   Solution:

   The graph of the region and the solid of revolution are shown in the following figure.
 (a) The region between the graph of the function f (x) = 4 - x and the x-axis over
the interval [0, 4]. (b) Revolving the region about the line y = -2 generates a solid of

                    revolution with a cylindrical hole through its middle.

We can't apply the volume formula to this problem directly because the axis of revolution is not
one of the coordinate axes. However, we still know that the area of the cross-section is the area of
the outer circle less the area of the inner circle. Looking at the graph of the function, we see the
radius of the outer circle is given by f (x) + 2, which simplifies to
Equation:

                                                                          f (x) + 2 = (4 - x) + 2 = 6 - x.

Key Concepts

      Definite integrals can be used to find the volumes of solids. Using the slicing method, we can find a
      volume by integrating the cross-sectional area.
      For solids of revolution, the volume slices are often disks and the cross-sections are circles. The
      method of disks involves applying the method of slicing in the particular case in which the cross-
      sections are circles, and using the formula for the area of a circle.
      If a solid of revolution has a cavity in the center, the volume slices are washers. With the method of
      washers, the area of the inner circle is subtracted from the area of the outer circle before integrating.

Volumes of Revolution: Cylindrical Shells

      Calculate the volume of a solid of revolution by using the method of
      cylindrical shells.
      Compare the different methods for calculating a volume of revolution.

In this section, we examine the method of cylindrical shells, the final
method for finding the volume of a solid of revolution. We can use this
method on the same kinds of solids as the disk method or the washer
method; however, with the disk and washer methods, we integrate along the
coordinate axis parallel to the axis of revolution. With the method of
cylindrical shells, we integrate along the coordinate axis perpendicular to
the axis of revolution. The ability to choose which variable of integration
we want to use can be a significant advantage with more complicated
functions. Also, the specific geometry of the solid sometimes makes the
method of using cylindrical shells more appealing than using the washer
method. In the last part of this section, we review all the methods for
finding volume that we have studied and lay out some guidelines to help
you determine which method to use in a given situation.

The Method of Cylindrical Shells

Again, we are working with a solid of revolution. As before, we define a
region R, bounded above by the graph of a function y = f(x), below by
the x-axis, and on the left and right by the lines x = a and x = b,
respectively, as shown in [link](a). We then revolve this region around the
y-axis, as shown in [link](b). Note that this is different from what we have
done before. Previously, regions defined in terms of functions of x were
revolved around the x-axis or a line parallel to it.
(a) A region bounded by the graph of a function of x. (b) The solid of
  revolution formed when the region is revolved around the y-axis.

As we have done many times before, partition the interval [a, b] using a

regular partition, P = {x0, x1,..., xn} and, for i = 1, 2,..., n, choose a

                        *

point xi  [xi-1, xi]. Then, construct a rectangle over the interval

              of  height  *                  and  width      A  representative  rectangle  is

[xi-1 ,  xi]              f (x            )              x.

                                       i

shown in [link](a). When that rectangle is revolved around the y-axis,

instead of a disk or a washer, we get a cylindrical shell, as shown in the

following figure.
      (a) A representative rectangle. (b) When this rectangle is revolved
   around the y-axis, the result is a cylindrical shell. (c) When we put all

      the shells together, we get an approximation of the original solid.

To calculate the volume of this shell, consider [link].
Calculating the volume of the
              shell.

The shell is a cylinder, so its volume is the cross-sectional area multiplied

by the height of the cylinder. The cross-sections are annuli (ring-shaped

regions--essentially, circles with a hole in the center), with outer radius xi

and  inner  radius  xi-1 .   Thus,  the  cross-sectional      area  is  x 2          -  x2 .           The

                                                                                  i               i-1

                                                                                             *

height of the cylinder is f(xi ). Then the volume of the shell is
Equation:

                    V shell                        *2 2

                             = f (xi )(xi - xi-1 )

                                                        *2 2

                             = f (xi ) (xi - xi-1 )

                                                        *

                             = f (xi ) (xi + xi-1 ) (xi - xi-1 )

                                         *  xi +xi-1

                             = 2f (xi ) ( 2 ) (xi - xi-1 ).
Note that xi - xi-1 = x, so we have
Equation:

*                                    xi + xi-1

Vshell = 2f (xi ) (                             )x.

                                        2

Furthermore, 2 xi+xi-1 is both the midpoint of the interval [xi-1, xi] and the

                                                                                                                                                                                                          *

average radius of the shell, and we can approximate this by xi . We then
have
Equation:

                                     *  *

Vshell  2f (xi )xi x.

Another way to think of this is to think of making a vertical cut in the shell
and then opening it up to form a flat plate ([link]).

(a) Make a vertical cut in a representative shell. (b) Open the shell up
                              to form a flat plate.
In reality, the outer radius of the shell is greater than the inner radius, and

hence the back edge of the plate would be slightly longer than the front

edge of the plate. However, we can approximate the flattened shell by a flat

           *           *
plate of height f(xi ), width 2xi , and thickness x ([link]). The volume

of the shell, then, is approximately the volume of the flat plate. Multiplying

the height, width, and depth of the plate, we get

Equation:

                          *               *

                 Vshell  f (xi ) (2xi )x,

which is the same formula we had before.

To calculate the volume of the entire solid, we then add the volumes of all
the shells and obtain
Equation:

                 n

                             *            *

              V   (2xi f (xi )x).

                 i=1

Here we have another Riemann sum, this time for the function 2xf(x).
Taking the limit as n   gives us
Equation:

              n

                                                                                                                                            b

                    *     *

       V = lim  (2xi f (xi )x) =                                                                                                               (2xf (x))dx.

                         n

                                                                                                                                         a
                                              i=1

This leads to the following rule for the method of cylindrical shells.

Note:
Rule: The Method of Cylindrical Shells

For the next example, we look at a solid of revolution for which the graph
of a function is revolved around a line other than one of the two coordinate
axes. To set this up, we need to revisit the development of the method of
cylindrical shells. Recall that we found the volume of one of the shells to be
given by
Equation:

         V shell                        *2 2

                  = f (xi )(xi - xi-1 )

                                             *2 2

                  = f (xi ) (xi - xi-1 )

                                             *

                  = f (xi ) (xi + xi-1 ) (xi - xi-1 )

                     *     xi +xi-1

                  = 2f (xi ) ( 2 ) (xi - xi-1 ).

This was based on a shell with an outer radius of xi and an inner radius of
xi-1. If, however, we rotate the region around a line other than the y-axis,
we have a different outer and inner radius. Suppose, for example, that we
rotate the region around the line x = -k, where k is some positive
constant. Then, the outer radius of the shell is xi + k and the inner radius of
the shell is xi-1 + k. Substituting these terms into the expression for
volume, we see that when a plane region is rotated around the line x = -k,
the volume of a shell is given by
Equation:

                  *  (xi +k)+(xi-1 +k)

V shell  = 2f (xi ) ( ) ((x 2 i + k) - (xi-1 + k))

                                        * xi +xi-2

         = 2f (xi ) (( 2 ) + k)x.

                                                                                      xi +xi-1

As before, we notice that 2 is the midpoint of the interval [xi-1, xi]

                                                                                                    *

and can be approximated by xi . Then, the approximate volume of the shell
is
Equation:

                        *                           *

         Vshell  2 (xi + k)f (xi )x.
The remainder of the development proceeds as before, and we see that
Equation:

                          b

V =                          (2 (x + k)f (x))dx.

                       a

We could also rotate the region around other horizontal or vertical lines,
such as a vertical line in the right half plane. In each case, the volume
formula must be adjusted accordingly. Specifically, the x-term in the
integral must be replaced with an expression representing the radius of a
shell. To see how this works, consider the following example.

Note that the radius of a shell is given by x + 1. Then the volume of

For our final example in this section, let's look at the volume of a solid of

two functions.

   Problem:
   A Region of Revolution Bounded by the Graphs of Two Functions

   Define R as the region bounded above by the graph of the function
   f(x) = x and below by the graph of the function g(x) = 1/x over
   the interval [1, 4]. Find the volume of the solid of revolution
   generated by revolving R around the y-axis.

   Solution:

   First, graph the region R and the associated solid of revolution, as
   shown in the following figure.
(a) The region R between the graph of f(x) and the graph of
   g(x) over the interval [1, 4]. (b) The solid of revolution
         generated by revolving R around the y-axis.

Note that the axis of revolution is the y-axis, so the radius of a shell is
given simply by x. We don't need to make any adjustments to the x-
term of our integrand. The height of a shell, though, is given by
f(x) - g(x), so in this case we need to adjust the f(x) term of the
integrand. Then the volume of the solid is given by

Which Method Should We Use?

We have studied several methods for finding the volume of a solid of
revolution, but how do we know which method to use? It often comes down
to a choice of which integral is easiest to evaluate. [link] describes the
different approaches for solids of revolution around the x-axis. It's up to
you to develop the analogous table for solids of revolution around the

y-axis.
Let's take a look at a couple of additional problems and decide on the best
approach to take for solving them.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Selecting the Best Method

   For each of the following problems, select the best method to find the
   volume of a solid of revolution generated by revolving the given
   region around the x-axis, and set up the integral to find the volume
   (do not evaluate the integral).
a. The region bounded by the graphs of y = x, y = 2 - x, and the

    x-axis.

b.  The  region  bounded    by  the  graphs  of    y  =  4x  -       2  and               the

                                                                x

    x-axis.

Solution:
   a. First, sketch the region and the solid of revolution as shown.

    (a) The region R bounded by two lines and the x-axis. (b)
    The solid of revolution generated by revolving R about the

                                                                x-axis.

    Looking at the region, if we want to integrate with respect to x,
    we would have to break the integral into two pieces, because we
    have different functions bounding the region over [0, 1] and
    [1, 2]. In this case, using the disk method, we would have
    Equation:

                         1                      2

                 V =                     2                                             2

                            (x )dx +               ((2 - x) )dx.

                      0                      1
If we used the shell method instead, we would use functions of y
to represent the curves, producing
Equation:

                 1

V =  (2y [(2 - y) - y])dy

                           0
                               1

=                   (2y [2 - 2y])dy.

              0

  Neither of these integrals is particularly onerous, but since the
  shell method requires only one integral, and the integrand
  requires less simplification, we should probably go with the shell
  method in this case.
b. First, sketch the region and the solid of revolution as shown.

(a) The region R between the curve and the x-axis. (b) The
   solid of revolution generated by revolving R about the
           x-axis.

Looking at the region, it would be problematic to define a
horizontal rectangle; the region is bounded on the left and right
by the same function. Therefore, we can dismiss the method of
shells. The solid has no cavity in the middle, so we can use the
method of disks. Then
Equation:

        4

V =                                         22

           (4x - x ) dx.

Key Concepts

      The method of cylindrical shells is another method for using a definite
      integral to calculate the volume of a solid of revolution. This method is
      sometimes preferable to either the method of disks or the method of
      washers because we integrate with respect to the other variable. In
      some cases, one integral is substantially more complicated than the
      other.
      The geometry of the functions and the difficulty of the integration are
      the main factors in deciding which integration method to use.

method of cylindrical shells

the methods of disks or washers in that we integrate with respect to the
opposite variable
Arc Length of a Curve and Surface Area

      Determine the length of a curve, y = f(x), between two points.
      Determine the length of a curve, x = g(y), between two points.
      Find the surface area of a solid of revolution.

In this section, we use definite integrals to find the arc length of a curve. We can think of arc
length as the distance you would travel if you were walking along the path of the curve. Many
real-world applications involve arc length. If a rocket is launched along a parabolic path, we
might want to know how far the rocket travels. Or, if a curve on a map represents a road, we
might want to know how far we have to drive to reach our destination.

We begin by calculating the arc length of curves defined as functions of x, then we examine the
same process for curves defined as functions of y. (The process is identical, with the roles of x
and y reversed.) The techniques we use to find arc length can be extended to find the surface area
of a surface of revolution, and we close the section with an examination of this concept.

Arc Length of the Curve y = f(x)

In previous applications of integration, we required the function f(x) to be integrable, or at most
continuous. However, for calculating arc length we have a more stringent requirement for f(x).
Here, we require f(x) to be differentiable, and furthermore we require its derivative, f (x), to be
continuous. Functions like this, which have continuous derivatives, are called smooth. (This
property comes up again in later chapters.)

Let f(x) be a smooth function defined over [a, b]. We want to calculate the length of the curve
from the point (a, f(a)) to the point (b, f(b)). We start by using line segments to approximate
the length of the curve. For i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of [a, b]. Then,
for i = 1, 2,..., n, construct a line segment from the point (xi-1, f(xi-1)) to the point
(xi, f(xi)). Although it might seem logical to use either horizontal or vertical line segments, we
want our line segments to approximate the curve as closely as possible. [link] depicts this
construct for n = 5.
   We can approximate the length of a curve by
                 adding line segments.

To help us find the length of each line segment, we look at the change in vertical distance as well
as the change in horizontal distance over each interval. Because we have used a regular partition,
the change in horizontal distance over each interval is given by x. The change in vertical
distance varies from interval to interval, though, so we use yi = f(xi) - f(xi-1) to represent
the change in vertical distance over the interval [xi-1, xi], as shown in [link]. Note that some (or
all) yi may be negative.

     A representative line segment
    approximates the curve over the

            interval [xi-1, xi].

By  the  Pythagorean  theorem,  the     length   of        the  line  segment   is                               2             +                       2  We  can  also

We summarize these findings in the following theorem.

Note:
Arc Length for y = f(x)
Let f(x) be a smooth function over the interval [a, b]. Then the arc length of the portion of the
graph of f(x) from the point (a, f(a)) to the point (b, f(b)) is given by
Equation:

                              Arc Length =            b

                                                         1 + [f  2 (x)] dx.

                                                 a

Note that we are integrating an expression involving f (x), so we need to be sure f (x) is
integrable. This is why we require f(x) to be smooth. The following example shows how to
apply the theorem.

Area of a Surface of Revolution

The concepts we used to find the arc length of a curve can be extended to find the surface area of
a surface of revolution. Surface area is the total area of the outer layer of an object. For objects
such as cubes or bricks, the surface area of the object is the sum of the areas of all of its faces.
For curved surfaces, the situation is a little more complex. Let f(x) be a nonnegative smooth
function over the interval [a, b]. We wish to find the surface area of the surface of revolution
created by revolving the graph of y = f(x) around the x-axis as shown in the following figure.
       (a) A curve representing the function f(x). (b) The surface of revolution
                formed by revolving the graph of f(x) around the x-axis.

As we have done many times before, we are going to partition the interval [a, b] and approximate
the surface area by calculating the surface area of simpler shapes. We start by using line
segments to approximate the curve, as we did earlier in this section. For i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let
P = {xi} be a regular partition of [a, b]. Then, for i = 1, 2,..., n, construct a line segment from
the point (xi-1, f(xi-1)) to the point (xi, f(xi)). Now, revolve these line segments around the
x-axis to generate an approximation of the surface of revolution as shown in the following
figure.
      (a) Approximating f(x) with line segments. (b) The surface of revolution
                formed by revolving the line segments around the x-axis.

Notice that when each line segment is revolved around the axis, it produces a band. These bands
are actually pieces of cones (think of an ice cream cone with the pointy end cut off). A piece of a
cone like this is called a frustum of a cone.
To find the surface area of the band, we need to find the lateral surface area, S, of the frustum
(the area of just the slanted outside surface of the frustum, not including the areas of the top or
bottom faces). Let r1 and r2 be the radii of the wide end and the narrow end of the frustum,
respectively, and let l be the slant height of the frustum as shown in the following figure.

    A frustum of a cone can approximate a small
                   part of surface area.

We know the lateral surface area of a cone is given by
Equation:

                                                                             Lateral Surf ace Area = rs,

where r is the radius of the base of the cone and s is the slant height (see the following figure).
    The lateral surface area of
     the cone is given by rs.
Since a frustum can be thought of as a piece of a cone, the lateral surface area of the frustum is
given by the lateral surface area of the whole cone less the lateral surface area of the smaller cone
(the pointy tip) that was cut off (see the following figure).

   Calculating the lateral surface
    area of a frustum of a cone.
The cross-sections of the small cone and the large cone are similar triangles, so we see that
Equation:
                                                     r2                s-l

                                                              =                         .

                                                     r1                s

Solving for s, we get
Equation:

                                                     r2                s-l

                                                     r1       =        s

                                                     r2 s = r1 (s - l)

                                                     r2s = r1s - r1l

                                                     r1l = r1s - r2s

                                                     r1 l = (r1 - r2 )s

                                                      r1l     = s.
                                                  r1 -r2

Then the lateral surface area (SA) of the frustum is
Equation:

S = (Lateral SA of large cone) - (Lateral SA of small cone)

= r1 s - r2 (s - l)

                                         r1l                  r1l
= r1 ( r1-r2 ) - r2 ( r1-r2                                            - l)

=                        r2 l         -  r1 r2 l  + r2 l
=                                        r1 -r2
=                                  1
=
                       r1 -r2

                         r2 l         -  r1 r2 l  +  r2 l(r1 -r2 )
                                         r1 -r2             r1 -r2

                                         r1 -r2      r1 -r2
                                   1                                    r2 l
                                                                       r1 -r2
                       r1 -r2

                       2              2
                       (r1 -r2 )l
                                              =  (r1 -r2 )(r1 +r2 )l   =  (r1 + r2 )l.
                       r1 -r2                                  r1 -r2

Let's now use this formula to calculate the surface area of each of the bands formed by revolving
the line segments around the x-axis. A representative band is shown in the following figure.
    A representative band used for
       determining surface area.

Note that the slant height of this frustum is just the length of the line segment used to generate it.
So, applying the surface area formula, we have
Equation:

           S =  (r1 + r2 )l
                   =  (f (xi-1 ) + f (xi ))x2 2 + (yi )

                                                         2

           =  (f (xi-1 ) + f (xi ))x1 + (    yi  ).

                                             x

Now, as we did in the development of the arc length formula, we apply the Mean Value Theorem

to select xi  [xi-1, xi] * such that f (xi ) = (yi)/x. * This gives us
Equation:

                                              *2
           S =  (f (xi-1 ) + f (xi ))x 1 + (f (xi )) .

Furthermore, since f(x) is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a point

**         **
xi  [xi-1, xi] such that f(xi ) = (1/2) [f(xi-1) + f(xi)], so we get

Equation:

                                    **    *  2

           S = 2f (x )x1 + (f  (x )) .
                                    i     i

Then the approximate surface area of the whole surface of revolution is given by
Equation:

                                     n

                                          **                 *  2

               Surf ace Area   2f (x )x1 + (f  (x )) .
                                          i                  i

                                     i=1

This almost looks like a Riemann sum, except we have functions evaluated at two different

*          **
points, xi and xi , over the interval [xi-1, xi]. Although we do not examine the details here, it

turns out that because f(x) is smooth, if we let n  , the limit works the same as a Riemann

                                                                                          *       **
sum even with the two different evaluation points. This makes sense intuitively. Both xi and xi

                                                          *                           **
are in the interval [xi-1, xi], so it makes sense that as n  , both xi and xi approach x.

Those of you who are interested in the details should consult an advanced calculus text.

Taking the limit as n  , we get
Equation:

               n

                                                       b

                                 **           *  2        (2f (x)1 + (f  2 (x)) )dx.

Surf ace Area = lim  2f (x )x1 + (f  (x )) = 
                                 i            i
           n

                                                    a

               i=1

As with arc length, we can conduct a similar development for functions of y to get a formula for
the surface area of surfaces of revolution about the y-axis. These findings are summarized in the
following theorem.

Note:

surface of revolution formed by revolving the graph of f(x) around the x-axis is given by

Key Concepts

      The arc length of a curve can be calculated using a definite integral.
      The arc length is first approximated using line segments, which generates a Riemann sum.
      Taking a limit then gives us the definite integral formula. The same process can be applied
      to functions of y.
      The concepts used to calculate the arc length can be generalized to find the surface area of a
      surface of revolution.
      The integrals generated by both the arc length and surface area formulas are often difficult
      to evaluate. It may be necessary to use a computer or calculator to approximate the values of
      the integrals.

      Find the hydrostatic force against a submerged vertical plate.

In this section, we examine some physical applications of integration. Let's begin with a look at
calculating mass from a density function. We then turn our attention to work, and close the section
with a study of hydrostatic force.

Mass and Density

We can use integration to develop a formula for calculating mass based on a density function. First we
consider a thin rod or wire. Orient the rod so it aligns with the x-axis, with the left end of the rod at
x = a and the right end of the rod at x = b ([link]). Note that although we depict the rod with some
thickness in the figures, for mathematical purposes we assume the rod is thin enough to be treated as a
one-dimensional object.

    We can calculate the mass of a thin
      rod oriented along the x-axis by
      integrating its density function.

If the rod has constant density , given in terms of mass per unit length, then the mass of the rod is
just the product of the density and the length of the rod: (b - a). If the density of the rod is not
constant, however, the problem becomes a little more challenging. When the density of the rod varies
from point to point, we use a linear density function, (x), to denote the density of the rod at any
point, x. Let (x) be an integrable linear density function. Now, for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n let P = {xi} be
a regular partition of the interval [a, b], and for i = 1, 2,..., n choose an arbitrary point

     *

xi  [xi-1, xi]. [link] shows a representative segment of the rod.
A representative segment of the rod.

The mass mi of the segment of the rod from xi-1 to xi is approximated by
Equation:

                                      *                                                                      *

mi  (xi ) (xi - xi-1 ) = (xi )x.

Adding the masses of all the segments gives us an approximation for the mass of the entire rod:
Equation:

                                      n                             n

                                                                         *

m =  mi   (xi )x.

                                      i=1                           i=1

This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as n  , we get an expression for the exact mass of the
rod:
Equation:

                                         n

                                                                                                          b

                                                                 *

m = lim  (xi )x =                                                                                            (x)dx.

                                        i=1

We state this result in the following theorem.

Note:
Mass-Density Formula of a One-Dimensional Object
Given a thin rod oriented along the x-axis over the interval [a, b], let (x) denote a linear density
function giving the density of the rod at a point x in the interval. Then the mass of the rod is given by
Equation:

                                                                 b

                                      m=                            (x)dx.

Consider a thin rod oriented on the x-axis over the interval [1, 3]. If the density of the rod is

given  by  (x)  =           2  +  3,  what  is  the  mass  of                                 the  rod?

                   2x

Solution:

     70/3

Hint
Use the process from the previous example.

We now extend this concept to find the mass of a two-dimensional disk of radius r. As with the rod
we looked at in the one-dimensional case, here we assume the disk is thin enough that, for
mathematical purposes, we can treat it as a two-dimensional object. We assume the density is given in
terms of mass per unit area (called area density), and further assume the density varies only along the
disk's radius (called radial density). We orient the disk in the xy-plane, with the center at the origin.
Then, the density of the disk can be treated as a function of x, denoted (x). We assume (x) is

integrable. Because density is a function of x, we partition the interval from [0, r] along the x-axis.
For i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of the interval [0, r], and for i = 1, 2,..., n,
                                                                                         *

choose an arbitrary point xi  [xi-1, xi]. Now, use the partition to break up the disk into thin (two-
dimensional) washers. A disk and a representative washer are depicted in the following figure.

(a) A thin disk in the xy-plane. (b) A representative washer.

We now approximate the density and area of the washer to calculate an approximate mass, mi. Note
that the area of the washer is given by
Equation:

       2               2

Ai  = (xi ) - (xi-1 )

    2        2
    =  [x - x ]
    i        i-1

    =  (xi + xi-1 ) (xi - xi-1 )

    = (xi + xi-1 )x.

You may recall that we had an expression similar to this when we were computing volumes by shells.

                                                                                      *

As we did there, we use xi  (xi + xi-1)/2 to approximate the average radius of the washer. We
obtain
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    *

                                                                            Ai = (xi + xi-1 )x  2xi x.

                                  *

Using (xi ) to approximate the density of the washer, we approximate the mass of the washer by
Equation:

          *       *

    mi  2xi (xi )x.
Adding up the masses of the washers, we see the mass m of the entire disk is approximated by
Equation:

                                  n                            n

                                                                    *                                                                  *

           m =  mi   2xi (xi )x.

                               i=1                             i=1

We again recognize this as a Riemann sum, and take the limit as n  . This gives us
Equation:

                               n

                                                                                                                                       r

                                         *                     *

           m = lim  2xi (xi )x =                                                                                                          2x(x)dx.

                             n

                                                                                                                                    0
                                                   i=1

We summarize these findings in the following theorem.

Use the process from the previous example.

Work Done by a Force

We now consider work. In physics, work is related to force, which is often intuitively defined as a
push or pull on an object. When a force moves an object, we say the force does work on the object. In
other words, work can be thought of as the amount of energy it takes to move an object. According to
physics, when we have a constant force, work can be expressed as the product of force and distance.

In the English system, the unit of force is the pound and the unit of distance is the foot, so work is
given in foot-pounds. In the metric system, kilograms and meters are used. One newton is the force
needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 m/sec2. Thus, the most common unit of work
is the newton-meter. This same unit is also called the joule. Both are defined as kilograms times

meters squared over seconds squared (kg  m2/s2).

When we have a constant force, things are pretty easy. It is rare, however, for a force to be constant.
The work done to compress (or elongate) a spring, for example, varies depending on how far the
spring has already been compressed (or stretched). We look at springs in more detail later in this
section.

Suppose we have a variable force F (x) that moves an object in a positive direction along the x-axis
from point a to point b. To calculate the work done, we partition the interval [a, b] and estimate the
work done over each subinterval. So, for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        *

interval [a, b], and for i = 1, 2,..., n, choose an arbitrary point xi  [xi-1, xi]. To calculate the work
done to move an object from point xi-1 to point xi, we assume the force is roughly constant over the

                                                                       *

interval, and use F (xi ) to approximate the force. The work done over the interval [xi-1, xi], then, is
given by
Equation:

                      *  *

                      Wi  F (xi ) (xi - xi-1 ) = F (xi )x.
Therefore, the work done over the interval [a, b] is approximately
Equation:

   W                                               n               n
                                                                                           *
                                      =  Wi
                                                        F (x )x.

                                                                                           i

                                      i=1                            i=1

Taking the limit of this expression as n   gives us the exact value for work:
Equation:

                                      n                                        b

                                                      *

W  = lim  F (xi )x =                                                              F (x)dx.

            n
                              i=1 a

Thus, we can define work as follows.

Note:
Definition
If a variable force F (x) moves an object in a positive direction along the x-axis from point a to point
b, then the work done on the object is
Equation:

                                                                  b

                                      W =                            F (x)dx.

                                                               a

Note that if F is constant, the integral evaluates to F  (b - a) = F  d, which is the formula we stated
at the beginning of this section.

Now let's look at the specific example of the work done to compress or elongate a spring. Consider a
block attached to a horizontal spring. The block moves back and forth as the spring stretches and
compresses. Although in the real world we would have to account for the force of friction between the
block and the surface on which it is resting, we ignore friction here and assume the block is resting on
a frictionless surface. When the spring is at its natural length (at rest), the system is said to be at
equilibrium. In this state, the spring is neither elongated nor compressed, and in this equilibrium
position the block does not move until some force is introduced. We orient the system such that x = 0
corresponds to the equilibrium position (see the following figure).
        A block attached to a horizontal spring at
        equilibrium, compressed, and elongated.

According to Hooke's law, the force required to compress or stretch a spring from an equilibrium
position is given by F (x) = kx, for some constant k. The value of k depends on the physical
characteristics of the spring. The constant k is called the spring constant and is always positive. We
can use this information to calculate the work done to compress or elongate a spring, as shown in the
following example.

Example:

   Problem:
   The Work Required to Stretch or Compress a Spring

   Suppose it takes a force of 10 N (in the negative direction) to compress a spring 0.2 m from the
   equilibrium position. How much work is done to stretch the spring 0.5 m from the equilibrium
   position?

   Solution:

   First find the spring constant, k. When x = -0.2, we know F (x) = -10, so
   Equation:
and F (x) = 50x. Then, to calculate work, we integrate the force function, obtaining                       F(x)=kx
Equation:                                                                                                   -10 = k(-0.2)

The work done to stretch the spring is 6.25 J.

Hint

Use the process from the previous example. Be careful with units.

Work Done in Pumping

Consider the work done to pump water (or some other liquid) out of a tank. Pumping problems are a
little more complicated than spring problems because many of the calculations depend on the shape
and size of the tank. In addition, instead of being concerned about the work done to move a single
mass, we are looking at the work done to move a volume of water, and it takes more work to move the
water from the bottom of the tank than it does to move the water from the top of the tank.

We examine the process in the context of a cylindrical tank, then look at a couple of examples using
tanks of different shapes. Assume a cylindrical tank of radius 4 m and height 10 m is filled to a depth
of 8 m. How much work does it take to pump all the water over the top edge of the tank?

The first thing we need to do is define a frame of reference. We let x represent the vertical distance
below the top of the tank. That is, we orient the x-axis vertically, with the origin at the top of the tank
and the downward direction being positive (see the following figure).
     How much work is needed to empty a tank partially
                         filled with water?

Using this coordinate system, the water extends from x = 2 to x = 10. Therefore, we partition the
interval [2, 10] and look at the work required to lift each individual "layer" of water. So, for
i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of the interval [2, 10], and for i = 1, 2,..., n,

                                                                                         *

choose an arbitrary point xi  [xi-1, xi]. [link] shows a representative layer.

                A representative layer of water.

In pumping problems, the force required to lift the water to the top of the tank is the force required to
overcome gravity, so it is equal to the weight of the water. Given that the weight-density of water is
9800 N/m3, or 62.4 lb/ft3, calculating the volume of each layer gives us the weight. In this case, we
have
Equation:

                                                   2

                 V = (4) x = 16x.

Then, the force needed to lift each layer is
Equation:

                                                                           F = 9800  16x = 156,800x.

Note that this step becomes a little more difficult if we have a noncylindrical tank. We look at a
noncylindrical tank in the next example.

We also need to know the distance the water must be lifted. Based on our choice of coordinate

                                                                         *

systems, we can use xi as an approximation of the distance the layer must be lifted. Then the work to
lift the ith layer of water Wi is approximately
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                              *

                                                                                            Wi  156,800xi x.

Adding the work for each layer, we see the approximate work to empty the tank is given by
Equation:

The work required to empty the tank is approximately 23,650,000 J.

For pumping problems, the calculations vary depending on the shape of the tank or container. The
following problem-solving strategy lays out a step-by-step process for solving pumping problems.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving Pumping Problems
   1. Sketch a picture of the tank and select an appropriate frame of reference.
   2. Calculate the volume of a representative layer of water.
   3. Multiply the volume by the weight-density of water to get the force.
   4. Calculate the distance the layer of water must be lifted.
   5. Multiply the force and distance to get an estimate of the work needed to lift the layer of water.
   6. Sum the work required to lift all the layers. This expression is an estimate of the work required

      to pump out the desired amount of water, and it is in the form of a Riemann sum.
   7. Take the limit as n   and evaluate the resulting integral to get the exact work required to

      pump out the desired amount of water.

We now apply this problem-solving strategy in an example with a noncylindrical tank.

Example:

   Problem:
   A Pumping Problem with a Noncylindrical Tank

   Assume a tank in the shape of an inverted cone, with height 12 ft and base radius 4 ft. The tank
   is full to start with, and water is pumped over the upper edge of the tank until the height of the
   water remaining in the tank is 4 ft. How much work is required to pump out that amount of
   water?

   Solution:

   The tank is depicted in [link]. As we did in the example with the cylindrical tank, we orient the
   x-axis vertically, with the origin at the top of the tank and the downward direction being
   positive (step 1).
    A water tank in the shape of
           an inverted cone.

The tank starts out full and ends with 4 ft of water left, so, based on our chosen frame of
reference, we need to partition the interval [0, 8]. Then, for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a
regular partition of the interval [0, 8], and for i = 1, 2,..., n, choose an arbitrary point

triangles to find the radius of the disk (see the following figure).
Using similar triangles to express the radius of a disk of water.

Then the volume of the disk is
Equation:

                                Vi = (4 -                   *         2               (step  2).

The weight-density of water is 62.4 lb/ft3, so the force needed to lift each layer is approximately

Based on the diagram, the distance the water must be lifted is approximately xi feet (step 4), so
the approximate work needed to lift the layer is
Equation:

                                                                                          *              *         2               (step         5).

Summing the work required to lift all the layers, we get an approximate value of the total work:

Hydrostatic Force and Pressure

In this last section, we look at the force and pressure exerted on an object submerged in a liquid. In the
English system, force is measured in pounds. In the metric system, it is measured in newtons. Pressure
is force per unit area, so in the English system we have pounds per square foot (or, perhaps more
commonly, pounds per square inch, denoted psi). In the metric system we have newtons per square
meter, also called pascals.
Let's begin with the simple case of a plate of area A submerged horizontally in water at a depth s
([link]). Then, the force exerted on the plate is simply the weight of the water above it, which is given
by F = As, where  is the weight density of water (weight per unit volume). To find the
hydrostatic pressure--that is, the pressure exerted by water on a submerged object--we divide the
force by the area. So the pressure is p = F /A = s.

            A plate submerged horizontally in water.

By Pascal's principle, the pressure at a given depth is the same in all directions, so it does not matter if
the plate is submerged horizontally or vertically. So, as long as we know the depth, we know the
pressure. We can apply Pascal's principle to find the force exerted on surfaces, such as dams, that are
oriented vertically. We cannot apply the formula F = As directly, because the depth varies from
point to point on a vertically oriented surface. So, as we have done many times before, we form a
partition, a Riemann sum, and, ultimately, a definite integral to calculate the force.

Suppose a thin plate is submerged in water. We choose our frame of reference such that the x-axis is
oriented vertically, with the downward direction being positive, and point x = 0 corresponding to a
logical reference point. Let s(x) denote the depth at point x. Note we often let x = 0 correspond to
the surface of the water. In this case, depth at any point is simply given by s(x) = x. However, in
some cases we may want to select a different reference point for x = 0, so we proceed with the
development in the more general case. Last, let w(x) denote the width of the plate at the point x.

Assume the top edge of the plate is at point x = a and the bottom edge of the plate is at point x = b.
Then, for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of the interval [a, b], and for

                                                                                                                                              *

i = 1, 2,..., n, choose an arbitrary point xi  [xi-1, xi]. The partition divides the plate into several
thin, rectangular strips (see the following figure).

A thin plate submerged vertically in water.

Let's now estimate the force on a representative strip. If the strip is thin enough, we can treat it as if it

                                                                                     *

is at a constant depth, s(xi ). We then have
Equation:

*                                                                  *

Fi = As =  [w(xi )x]s(xi ).

Adding the forces, we get an estimate for the force on the plate:
Equation:

F   Fi =   [w(xi )x]s(xi ).

   i=1     i=1

This is a Riemann sum, so taking the limit gives us the exact force. We obtain

                                       i=1

Evaluating this integral gives us the force on the plate. We summarize this in the following problem-
solving strategy.

      reference other than the one used earlier, we may have to adjust [link] accordingly.)

   2. Determine the depth and width functions, s(x) and w(x).
   3. Determine the weight-density of whatever liquid with which you are working. The weight-

      density of water is 62.4 lb/ft3, or 9800 N/m3.
   4. Use the equation to calculate the total force.

   Finding Hydrostatic Force

   A water trough 15 ft long has ends shaped like inverted isosceles triangles, with base 8 ft and
   height 3 ft. Find the force on one end of the trough if the trough is full of water.

   Solution:

   [link] shows the trough and a more detailed view of one end.
(a) A water trough with a triangular cross-section. (b) Dimensions
                     of one end of the water trough.

Select a frame of reference with the x-axis oriented vertically and the downward direction being
positive. Select the top of the trough as the point corresponding to x = 0 (step 1). The depth
function, then, is s(x) = x. Using similar triangles, we see that w(x) = 8 - (8/3)x (step 2).
Now, the weight density of water is 62.4 lb/ft3 (step 3), so applying [link], we obtain
Equation:

F =  w(x)s(x)dx

                                                                                              3

                        0

The water exerts a force of 748.8 lb on the end of the trough (step 4).

   Problem:
   Chapter Opener: Finding Hydrostatic Force
   We now return our attention to the Hoover Dam, mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. The
   actual dam is arched, rather than flat, but we are going to make some simplifying assumptions to
   help us with the calculations. Assume the face of the Hoover Dam is shaped like an isosceles
   trapezoid with lower base 750 ft, upper base 1250 ft, and height 750 ft (see the following
   figure).

   When the reservoir is full, Lake Mead's maximum depth is about 530 ft, and the surface of the
   lake is about 10 ft below the top of the dam (see the following figure).
       A simplified model of the Hoover Dam with
                     assumed dimensions.

   a. Find the force on the face of the dam when the reservoir is full.
   b. The southwest United States has been experiencing a drought, and the surface of Lake

      Mead is about 125 ft below where it would be if the reservoir were full. What is the force
      on the face of the dam under these circumstances?

Solution:
   a. We begin by establishing a frame of reference. As usual, we choose to orient the x-axis
      vertically, with the downward direction being positive. This time, however, we are going to
      let x = 0 represent the top of the dam, rather than the surface of the water. When the
      reservoir is full, the surface of the water is 10 ft below the top of the dam, so
      s(x) = x - 10 (see the following figure).

                    We first choose a frame of reference.

      To find the width function, we again turn to similar triangles as shown in the figure below.
We use similar triangles to determine a function
     for the width of the dam. (a) Assumed

  dimensions of the dam; (b) highlighting the
                  similar triangles.

From the figure, we see that w(x) = 750 + 2r. Using properties of similar triangles, we
get r = 250 - (1/3)x. Thus,
Equation:

   w(x) = 1250 -  2
                      x (step 2).

                  3

Using a weight-density of 62.4 lb/ft3 (step 3) and applying [link], we get
Equation:

Note the change from pounds to tons (2000 lb = 1 ton) (step 4). This changes our depth
function, s(x), and our limits of integration. We have s(x) = x - 135. The lower limit of

Key Concepts

      Several physical applications of the definite integral are common in engineering and physics.
      Definite integrals can be used to determine the mass of an object if its density function is known.
      Work can also be calculated from integrating a force function, or when counteracting the force of
      gravity, as in a pumping problem.
      Definite integrals can also be used to calculate the force exerted on an object submerged in a
      liquid.

Moments and Centers of Mass
      Find the center of mass of objects distributed along a line.
      Locate the center of mass of a thin plate.
      Use symmetry to help locate the centroid of a thin plate.
      Apply the theorem of Pappus for volume.

In this section, we consider centers of mass (also called centroids, under certain conditions) and
moments. The basic idea of the center of mass is the notion of a balancing point. Many of us have
seen performers who spin plates on the ends of sticks. The performers try to keep several of them
spinning without allowing any of them to drop. If we look at a single plate (without spinning it),
there is a sweet spot on the plate where it balances perfectly on the stick. If we put the stick
anywhere other than that sweet spot, the plate does not balance and it falls to the ground. (That is
why performers spin the plates; the spin helps keep the plates from falling even if the stick is not
exactly in the right place.) Mathematically, that sweet spot is called the center of mass of the plate.
In this section, we first examine these concepts in a one-dimensional context, then expand our
development to consider centers of mass of two-dimensional regions and symmetry. Last, we use
centroids to find the volume of certain solids by applying the theorem of Pappus.

Center of Mass and Moments

Let's begin by looking at the center of mass in a one-dimensional context. Consider a long, thin
wire or rod of negligible mass resting on a fulcrum, as shown in [link](a). Now suppose we place
objects having masses m1 and m2 at distances d1 and d2 from the fulcrum, respectively, as shown
in [link](b).

    (a) A thin rod rests on a fulcrum. (b) Masses are
                       placed on the rod.
The most common real-life example of a system like this is a playground seesaw, or teeter-totter,
with children of different weights sitting at different distances from the center. On a seesaw, if one
child sits at each end, the heavier child sinks down and the lighter child is lifted into the air. If the
heavier child slides in toward the center, though, the seesaw balances. Applying this concept to the
masses on the rod, we note that the masses balance each other if and only if m1d1 = m2d2.

In the seesaw example, we balanced the system by moving the masses (children) with respect to
the fulcrum. However, we are really interested in systems in which the masses are not allowed to
move, and instead we balance the system by moving the fulcrum. Suppose we have two point
masses, m1 and m2, located on a number line at points x1 and x2, respectively ([link]). The
center of mass, x, - is the point where the fulcrum should be placed to make the system balance.

The center of mass x- is the balance point of
                   the system.

Thus, we have
Equation:

                     -                         -

               m1 |x1 - x| = m2 |x2 - x|

                  -                            -

               m1 (x - x1 ) = m2 (x2 - x)

               -                                                          -

               m1x - m1x1 = m2x2 - m2x

               -

               x (m1 + m2 ) = m1 x1 + m2 x2

                     -                         m1 x1 +m2 x2

                     x=                                                .

                                                    m1 +m2

The expression in the numerator, m1x1 + m2x2, is called the first moment of the system with
respect to the origin. If the context is clear, we often drop the word first and just refer to this
expression as the moment of the system. The expression in the denominator, m1 + m2, is the
total mass of the system. Thus, the center of mass of the system is the point at which the total
mass of the system could be concentrated without changing the moment.

This idea is not limited just to two point masses. In general, if n masses, m1, m2,..., mn, are
placed on a number line at points x1, x2,..., xn, respectively, then the center of mass of the
system is given by
Equation:

   Problem:
   Finding the Center of Mass of Objects along a Line

   Suppose four point masses are placed on a number line as follows:
   Equation:

m1 = 30 kg, placed at x1 = -2 m                      m2 = 5 kg, placed at x2 = 3 m
m3 = 10 kg, placed at x3 = 6 m                       m4 = 15 kg, placed at x4 = -3 m.

Find the moment of the system with respect to the origin and find the center of mass of the
system.
Solution:

First, we need to calculate the moment of the system:
Equation:

                    M               4

                       =  mixi

                                 i=1

                       = -60 + 15 + 60 - 45 = -30.

Now, to find the center of mass, we need the total mass of the system:
Equation:

                    m               4

                       =  mi

                                 i=1

                       = 30 + 5 + 10 + 15 = 60 kg.

Then we have
Equation:

                       -   M           -30             1

                       x=     =             =- .

                           m           60              2

The center of mass is located 1/2 m to the left of the origin.

Hint
Use the process from the previous example.

We can generalize this concept to find the center of mass of a system of point masses in a plane.
Let m1 be a point mass located at point (x1, y1) in the plane. Then the moment Mx of the mass
with respect to the x-axis is given by Mx = m1y1. Similarly, the moment My with respect to the
y-axis is given by My = m1x1. Notice that the x-coordinate of the point is used to calculate the
moment with respect to the y-axis, and vice versa. The reason is that the x-coordinate gives the
distance from the point mass to the y-axis, and the y-coordinate gives the distance to the x-axis
(see the following figure).

Point mass m1 is located at
point (x1, y1) in the plane.

If we have several point masses in the xy-plane, we can use the moments with respect to the x- and
y-axes to calculate the x- and y-coordinates of the center of mass of the system.

respectively, are given by
Equation:

Mx =  miyi                       and  My =  mixi.

Center of Mass of Thin Plates

So far we have looked at systems of point masses on a line and in a plane. Now, instead of having
the mass of a system concentrated at discrete points, we want to look at systems in which the mass
of the system is distributed continuously across a thin sheet of material. For our purposes, we
assume the sheet is thin enough that it can be treated as if it is two-dimensional. Such a sheet is
called a lamina. Next we develop techniques to find the center of mass of a lamina. In this
section, we also assume the density of the lamina is constant.

Laminas are often represented by a two-dimensional region in a plane. The geometric center of
such a region is called its centroid. Since we have assumed the density of the lamina is constant,
the center of mass of the lamina depends only on the shape of the corresponding region in the
plane; it does not depend on the density. In this case, the center of mass of the lamina corresponds
to the centroid of the delineated region in the plane. As with systems of point masses, we need to
find the total mass of the lamina, as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the x- and
y-axes.

We first consider a lamina in the shape of a rectangle. Recall that the center of mass of a lamina is
the point where the lamina balances. For a rectangle, that point is both the horizontal and vertical
center of the rectangle. Based on this understanding, it is clear that the center of mass of a
rectangular lamina is the point where the diagonals intersect, which is a result of the symmetry
principle, and it is stated here without proof.

Note:
The Symmetry Principle
If a region R is symmetric about a line l, then the centroid of R lies on l.

Let's turn to more general laminas. Suppose we have a lamina bounded above by the graph of a
continuous function f(x), below by the x-axis, and on the left and right by the lines x = a and
x = b, respectively, as shown in the following figure.

A region in the plane
representing a lamina.

As with systems of point masses, to find the center of mass of the lamina, we need to find the total
mass of the lamina, as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the x- and y-axes. As we
have done many times before, we approximate these quantities by partitioning the interval [a, b]
and constructing rectangles.

For i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of [a, b]. Recall that we can choose any

                                                *                                 *
point within the interval [xi-1, xi] as our xi . In this case, we want xi to be the x-coordinate of the

centroid of our rectangles. Thus, for i                     we  select  *                       such  that  *       is the

                                         =  1,  2,...,  n,              x         [xi-1 ,  xi]              x

                                                                             i                                   i

midpoint of the interval. That is, xi = (xi-1 + xi)/2. Now, for i = 1, 2,..., n, construct a

*                                                        *                                *
rectangle of height f (xi ) on [xi-1, xi]. The center of mass of this rectangle is (xi , (f(xi ))/2),

as shown in the following figure.

A representative rectangle
       of the lamina.

Next, we need to find the total mass of the rectangle. Let  represent the density of the lamina
(note that  is a constant). In this case,  is expressed in terms of mass per unit area. Thus, to find
the total mass of the rectangle, we multiply the area of the rectangle by . Then, the mass of the

rectangle is given by f(xi )x.

To get the approximate mass of the lamina, we add the masses of all the rectangles to get
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                      n
                                                                                                                                                                                 *

                                                                                                                                                   i=1

This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as n   gives the exact mass of the lamina:
Equation:

                                            b

Next, we calculate the moment of the lamina with respect to the x-axis. Returning to the

representative rectangle, recall its center of mass is (xi , (f(xi ))/2). Recall also that treating the

rectangle as if it is a point mass located at the center of mass does not change the moment. Thus,

the moment of the rectangle with respect to the x-axis is given by the mass of the rectangle,
*                                                                                                                                                                                                    *
f(xi )x, multiplied by the distance from the center of mass to the x-axis: (f(xi ))/2.

Therefore,  the  moment  with  respect  to                        the  x-axis   of  the  rectangle                                                            is         *                        2  /2)x. Adding

                                                                                                                                                                      ([f (x                  )]

                                                                                                                                                                                           i

                 Mx = lim                                                          x =                                                                                          dx.
                                                                                                                                                                     2

We derive the moment with respect to the y-axis similarly, noting that the distance from the center

                                                                                                                                       *

We find the coordinates of the center of mass by dividing the moments by the total mass to give
x = My/m and y = Mx/m. - - If we look closely at the expressions for Mx, My, and m, we
notice that the constant  cancels out when x- and y- are calculated.

We summarize these findings in the following theorem.

Note:
Center of Mass of a Thin Plate in the xy-Plane
Let R denote a region bounded above by the graph of a continuous function f(x), below by the x-
axis, and on the left and right by the lines x = a and x = b, respectively. Let  denote the density
of the associated lamina. Then we can make the following statements:

i. The mass of the lamina is

                                                                                    b

                                                                     m =   f (x)dx.

iii. The coordinates of the center of mass (x, y) - - are
    Equation:

-   My                  -                                  Mx
     m                                                               .
x=      and y =
                                                            m

In the next example, we use this theorem to find the center of mass of a lamina.

   Solution:
   The region is depicted in the following figure.

    Finding the center of mass
            of a lamina.

Since we are only asked for the centroid of the region, rather than the mass or moments of
the associated lamina, we know the density constant  cancels out of the calculations
eventually. Therefore, for the sake of convenience, let's assume  = 1.

First, we need to calculate the total mass:

Let  R  be  the  region  bounded  above  by    the               graph  of  the                                     function          f (x)  =       2  and  below  by  the

x-axis over the interval [0, 2]. Find the centroid of the region.

Solution:
   The centroid of the region is (3/2, 6/5).
Hint
Use the process from the previous example.
We can adapt this approach to find centroids of more complex regions as well. Suppose our region
is bounded above by the graph of a continuous function f(x), as before, but now, instead of
having the lower bound for the region be the x-axis, suppose the region is bounded below by the
graph of a second continuous function, g(x), as shown in the following figure.

   A region between two
           functions.

Again, we partition the interval [a, b] and construct rectangles. A representative rectangle is shown
in the following figure.

Note that the centroid of this rectangle is (xi , (f(xi ) + g(xi ))/2). We won't go through all the

details of the Riemann sum development, but let's look at some of the key steps. In the

development of the formulas for the mass of the lamina and the moment with respect to the y-axis,

the  height  of  each  rectangle                             is  given  by                     *                     *              which  leads    to                                                   the  expression

                                                                                           f (x            )  -  g(x            ),

Center of Mass of a Lamina Bounded by Two Functions
Let R denote a region bounded above by the graph of a continuous function f(x), below by the
graph of the continuous function g(x), and on the left and right by the lines x = a and x = b,
respectively. Let  denote the density of the associated lamina. Then we can make the following

       = 1.

   First, we calculate the total mass:

Next, we calculate the moments. We only need Mx:

Then we have

Note:
The Grand Canyon Skywalk
The Grand Canyon Skywalk opened to the public on March 28, 2007. This engineering marvel is
a horseshoe-shaped observation platform suspended 4000 ft above the Colorado River on the
West Rim of the Grand Canyon. Its crystal-clear glass floor allows stunning views of the canyon
below (see the following figure).

     The Grand Canyon Skywalk offers magnificent views of the canyon. (credit: 10da_ralta,
                                             Wikimedia Commons)

The Skywalk is a cantilever design, meaning that the observation platform extends over the rim
of the canyon, with no visible means of support below it. Despite the lack of visible support posts
or struts, cantilever structures are engineered to be very stable and the Skywalk is no exception.
The observation platform is attached firmly to support posts that extend 46 ft down into bedrock.
The structure was built to withstand 100-mph winds and an 8.0-magnitude earthquake within 50
mi, and is capable of supporting more than 70,000,000 lb.
One factor affecting the stability of the Skywalk is the center of gravity of the structure. We are
going to calculate the center of gravity of the Skywalk, and examine how the center of gravity
changes when tourists walk out onto the observation platform.
The observation platform is U-shaped. The legs of the U are 10 ft wide and begin on land, under
the visitors' center, 48 ft from the edge of the canyon. The platform extends 70 ft over the edge of
the canyon.
To calculate the center of mass of the structure, we treat it as a lamina and use a two-dimensional
region in the xy-plane to represent the platform. We begin by dividing the region into three
subregions so we can consider each subregion separately. The first region, denoted R1, consists
of the curved part of the U. We model R1 as a semicircular annulus, with inner radius 25 ft and
outer radius 35 ft, centered at the origin (see the following figure).

                           We model the Skywalk with three sub-regions.
The legs of the platform, extending 35 ft between R1 and the canyon wall, comprise the second
sub-region, R2. Last, the ends of the legs, which extend 48 ft under the visitor center, comprise
the third sub-region, R3. Assume the density of the lamina is constant and assume the total
weight of the platform is 1,200,000 lb (not including the weight of the visitor center; we will
consider that later). Use g = 32 ft/sec . 2
1. Compute the area of each of the three sub-regions. Note that the areas of regions R2 and R3
  should include the areas of the legs only, not the open space between them. Round answers
  to the nearest square foot.

2. Determine the mass associated with each of the three sub-regions.
3. Calculate the center of mass of each of the three sub-regions.
4. Now, treat each of the three sub-regions as a point mass located at the center of mass of the

  corresponding sub-region. Using this representation, calculate the center of mass of the
  entire platform.
5. Assume the visitor center weighs 2,200,000 lb, with a center of mass corresponding to the
  center of mass of R3. Treating the visitor center as a point mass, recalculate the center of
  mass of the system. How does the center of mass change?
6. Although the Skywalk was built to limit the number of people on the observation platform to
  120, the platform is capable of supporting up to 800 people weighing 200 lb each. If all 800
  people were allowed on the platform, and all of them went to the farthest end of the
  platform, how would the center of gravity of the system be affected? (Include the visitor
  center in the calculations and represent the people by a point mass located at the farthest
  edge of the platform, 70 ft from the canyon wall.)

Theorem of Pappus

This section ends with a discussion of the theorem of Pappus for volume, which allows us to
find the volume of particular kinds of solids by using the centroid. (There is also a theorem of
Pappus for surface area, but it is much less useful than the theorem for volume.)

Note:
Theorem of Pappus for Volume
Let R be a region in the plane and let l be a line in the plane that does not intersect R. Then the
volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving R around l is equal to the area of R
multiplied by the distance d traveled by the centroid of R.

Proof

We can prove the case when the region is bounded above by the graph of a function f(x) and
below by the graph of a function g(x) over an interval [a, b], and for which the axis of revolution

                                                                                                                                                                                                  b

is the y-axis. In this case, the area of the region is A =  [f(x) - g(x)]dx. Since the axis of

                                               a

rotation is the y-axis, the distance traveled by the centroid of the region depends only on the x-

coordinate  of  the  centroid,  -   which  is

                                x,

           m =                               [f (x) - g(x)]dx and My =                                                                                              x [f (x) - g(x)]dx.

Then,
Equation:

                                                                                     b

                                                                                            x [f (x) - g(x)]dx

                                                                                  a         b

                                                         a

and thus
Equation:

                                                                                            b

                                             d  A = 2                                          x [f (x) - g(x)]dx.

                                                                                         a

However, using the method of cylindrical shells, we have
Equation:

                                                                                 b

                                             V = 2                                   x [f (x) - g(x)]dx.

                                                                              a

So,
Equation:

                                             V = dA

and the proof is complete.

The region R is a circle of radius 2, so the area of R is A = 4 units2. By the symmetry

principle, the centroid of R is the center of the circle. The centroid travels around the y-axis

Key Concepts

Mathematically, the center of mass of a system is the point at which the total mass of the

system could be concentrated without changing the moment. Loosely speaking, the center of

mass can be thought of as the balancing point of the system.

For point masses distributed along a number line, the moment of the system with respect to

                                                                               n

the origin is M =  mixi. For point masses distributed in a plane, the moments of the

                                                    i=1
                                                                                                                                                                                                            n

system with respect to the x- and y-axes, respectively, are Mx =  miyi and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    i=1

My =  mixi, respectively.

For a lamina bounded above by a function f(x), the moments of the system with respect to

                                                             b              2                                                                                                                                                               b

the x- and y-axes, respectively, are Mx =                       [f (x)]        dx and My =   xf (x)dx.

The x- and y-coordinates of the center of mass can be found by dividing the moments around

the y-axis and around the x-axis, respectively, by the total mass. The symmetry principle says

that if a region is symmetric with respect to a line, then the centroid of the region lies on the

line.

The theorem of Pappus for volume says that if a region is revolved around an external axis,

the volume of the resulting solid is equal to the area of the region multiplied by the distance

traveled by the centroid of the region.

      Write the definition of the natural logarithm as an integral.
      Recognize the derivative of the natural logarithm.
      Integrate functions involving the natural logarithmic function.
      Define the number e through an integral.
      Recognize the derivative and integral of the exponential function.
      Prove properties of logarithms and exponential functions using integrals.
      Express general logarithmic and exponential functions in terms of natural logarithms and
      exponentials.

We already examined exponential functions and logarithms in earlier chapters. However, we glossed over
some key details in the previous discussions. For example, we did not study how to treat exponential
functions with exponents that are irrational. The definition of the number e is another area where the
previous development was somewhat incomplete. We now have the tools to deal with these concepts in a
more mathematically rigorous way, and we do so in this section.

For purposes of this section, assume we have not yet defined the natural logarithm, the number e, or any
of the integration and differentiation formulas associated with these functions. By the end of the section,
we will have studied these concepts in a mathematically rigorous way (and we will see they are consistent
with the concepts we learned earlier).

We begin the section by defining the natural logarithm in terms of an integral. This definition forms the
foundation for the section. From this definition, we derive differentiation formulas, define the number e,
and expand these concepts to logarithms and exponential functions of any base.

The Natural Logarithm as an Integral

Recall the power rule for integrals:
Equation:

                                                    n  x n+1

                                       x dx =                 + C, n  -1.

                                                       n+1

Clearly, this does not work when n = -1, as it would force us to divide by zero. So, what do we do with

1                                                                                   x  1

 dx? Recall from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that  dt is an antiderivative of 1/x.

x                                                                                   1t

Therefore, we can make the following definition.

Note:
Definition
For x > 0, define the natural logarithm function by
Equation:

                                                                        x  1
                                                                               dt.
                                      ln x = 
                                                                           t
                                                                    1
For x > 1, this is just the area under the curve y = 1/t from 1 to x. For x < 1, we have

x     1

   1                1
 dt = -  dt, so in this case it is the negative of the area under the curve from x to 1 (see the

1t    xt

following figure).

(a) When x > 1, the natural logarithm is the area under the curve
y = 1/t from 1 to x. (b) When x < 1, the natural logarithm is the

          negative of the area under the curve from x to 1.

Notice that ln 1 = 0. Furthermore, the function y = 1/t > 0 for x > 0. Therefore, by the properties of
integrals, it is clear that ln x is increasing for x > 0.

Properties of the Natural Logarithm

Because of the way we defined the natural logarithm, the following differentiation formula falls out
immediately as a result of to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

Note:
Derivative of the Natural Logarithm
For x > 0, the derivative of the natural logarithm is given by
Equation:

                        d             1
                              ln x =      .

                       dx             x

Note:
Corollary to the Derivative of the Natural Logarithm
The function ln x is differentiable; therefore, it is continuous.
A graph of ln x is shown in [link]. Notice that it is continuous throughout its domain of (0, ).

The graph of f (x) = ln x
     shows that it is a

   continuous function.

          dx

Hint
Apply the differentiation formula just provided and use the chain rule as necessary.

Note that if we use the absolute value function and create a new function ln |x|, we can extend the
domain of the natural logarithm to include x < 0. Then (d/ (dx))ln |x| = 1/x. This gives rise to the
familiar integration formula.

Note:
Integral of (1/u) du
The natural logarithm is the antiderivative of the function f (u) = 1/u:
Equation:

                                                                    1

                                                                    u

Apply the integration formula provided earlier and use u-substitution as necessary.

Although we have called our function a "logarithm," we have not actually proved that any of the
properties of logarithms hold for this function. We do so here.

Properties of the Natural Logarithm
If a, b > 0 and r is a rational number, then

   i. ln 1 = 0
  ii. ln (ab) = ln a + ln b
  iii. ln ( ) a = ln a - ln b

                               b

  iv. ln (ar) = r ln a

Proof

                               1  1

i. By definition, ln 1 =             dt = 0.

                            1t

ii. We have

  Equation:

                                                                             ab                                    a                                   ab  1

  Use u-substitution on the last integral in this expression. Let u = t/a. Then du = (1/a)dt.
Furthermore, when t = a, u = 1, and when t = ab, u = b. So we get
Equation:

                a                ab              a                ab                                                  a            b

ln (ab) =              dt +               dt =          dt +          dt =                                                   dt+          du = ln a + ln b.

iii. Note that
    Equation:

                                                 d rxr-1 r
                                                        r
                                                 ln (x ) =           =                                             .

                                          dx                      xr x

Furthermore,
Equation:

                                                  d                  r
                                                        (r ln x) =       .

                                                 dx                  x

Since the derivatives of these two functions are the same, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
they must differ by a constant. So we have
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                    r

                                                                                            ln (x ) = r ln x + C

for some constant C. Taking x = 1, we get
Equation:

                                                                                       ln (1r ) = r ln (1) + C
                                                                                                    0 = r (0) + C

                                                                                                   C = 0.

      Thus ln (xr) = r ln x and the proof is complete. Note that we can extend this property to irrational
      values of r later in this section.
      Part iii. follows from parts ii. and iv. and the proof is left to you.

Hint
Apply the properties of logarithms.

Defining the Number e

Now that we have the natural logarithm defined, we can use that function to define the number e.

Note:
Definition
The number e is defined to be the real number such that
Equation:

                                                                                                                ln e = 1.

To put it another way, the area under the curve y = 1/t between t = 1 and t = e is 1 ([link]). The proof
that such a number exists and is unique is left to you. (Hint: Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to prove
existence and the fact that ln x is increasing to prove uniqueness.)

The area under the curve from 1
       to e is equal to one.

The number e can be shown to be irrational, although we won't do so here (see the Student Project in
Taylor and Maclaurin Series). Its approximate value is given by
Equation:

                                                                                                  e  2.71828182846.

The Exponential Function

We  now  turn  our  attention  to  the  function      x  Note  that  the  natural  logarithm  is  one-to-one  and  therefore

                                                  e.

has an inverse function. For now, we denote this inverse function by exp x. Then,

Equation:

                    exp (ln x) = x f or x > 0 and ln (exp x) = x f or all x.

The following figure shows the graphs of exp x and ln x.
             The graphs of ln x and exp x.

We hypothesize that exp x = ex. For rational values of x, this is easy to show. If x is rational, then we
have ln (ex) = x ln e = x. Thus, when x is rational, ex = exp x. For irrational values of x, we simply
define ex as the inverse function of ln x.

Note:
Definition
For any real number x, define y = ex to be the number for which
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                      x

                                                                                                    ln y = ln (e ) = x.

Then    we  have      x  =  exp  (x)  for  all  x,  and  thus

                  e

Equation:

                                                ln x                             x
                                           e          = x f or x > 0 and ln (e ) = x

for all x.

Properties of the Exponential Function

Since the exponential function was defined in terms of an inverse function, and not in terms of a power of

e,  we  must  verify     that  the  usual  laws  of   exponents  hold  for  the  function      x

                                                                                           e.
Note:
Properties of the Exponential Function
If p and q are any real numbers and r is a rational number, then

   i. epeq = ep+q
  ii. q e = e p p-q

                  e

  iii. (ep) = e r pr

Proof

Note that if p and q are rational, the properties hold. However, if p or q are irrational, we must apply the
inverse function definition of ex and verify the properties. Only the first property is verified here; the
other two are left to you. We have
Equation:

                                    pq              p        q             p+q

                            ln (e e ) = ln (e ) + ln (e ) = p + q = ln (e       ).

Since ln x is one-to-one, then
Equation:

                                                       pq         p+q  .
                                                       e e =e



As with part iv. of the logarithm properties, we can extend property iii. to irrational values of r, and we do
so by the end of the section.

We also want to verify the differentiation formula for the function y = ex. To do this, we need to use

implicit  differentiation.  Let  y  =      x  Then

                                       e.

Equation:

                                                       ln y = x

                                                     d             d

                                                          ln y =        x

                                                    dx            dx

                                                       1 dy  =1
                                                       y dx

                                                       dy

                                                                 = y.

                                                       dx

Thus, we see
Equation:

                                                        dx x
                                                              e =e

                                                       dx

as desired, which leads immediately to the integration formula
Equation:

General Logarithmic and Exponential Functions

We close this section by looking at exponential functions and logarithms with bases other than e.

Exponential    functions  are  functions       of  the  form  f  (x)   =           x  Note  that  unless   a  =  e,  we  still  do  not  have

                                                                               a.

a mathematically rigorous definition of these functions for irrational exponents. Let's rectify that here by

defining  the  function  f  (x)  =      x  in  terms    of  the  exponential          function      x  We  then  examine  logarithms

                                    a                                                           e.

with bases other than e as inverse functions of exponential functions.

Note:
Definition
For any a > 0, and for any real number x, define y = ax as follows:
Equation:

                                                                    x     x ln a

                                                        y=a =e                        .
Now ax is defined rigorously for all values of x. This definition also allows us to generalize property iv.
of logarithms and property iii. of exponential functions to apply to both rational and irrational values of r.
It is straightforward to show that properties of exponents hold for general exponential functions defined
in this way.

Let's now apply this definition to calculate a differentiation formula for ax. We have
Equation:

            dx        d x ln a x ln a x
                  a=
                          e  =e     ln a = a ln a.
           dx
                      dx

The corresponding integration formula follows immediately.

Note:
Derivatives and Integrals Involving General Exponential Functions
Let a > 0. Then,
Equation:

                           dx x
                                 a = a ln a

                          dx

and
Equation:

                         x          1

            a dx =                                 x

                                           a + C.

                             ln a

If a  1, then the function ax is one-to-one and has a well-defined inverse. Its inverse is denoted by
logax. Then,
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 y

                                                                                   y = loga x if and only if x = a .

Note that general logarithm functions can be written in terms of the natural logarithm. Let y = logax.
Then, x = ay. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of this second equation, we get
Equation:

                                                                            y

                          ln x = ln (a )

                          ln x = y ln a

                                y=  ln x

                                a   ln a

                      log x =       ln x

                                            .

                                    ln a
Thus, we see that all logarithmic functions are constant multiples of one another. Next, we use this
formula to find a differentiation formula for a logarithm with base a. Again, let y = logax. Then,
Equation:

                                      dy       d

                                      dx dx = (loga x)

                                            =  d        ln x

                                                     (             )

                                               dx       ln a

                                            =(     1            d  (ln x)

                                                        )

                                                ln a         dx

                                            =   1            1

                                               ln a          x

                                            =     1       .

Key Concepts

   The earlier treatment of logarithms and exponential functions did not define the functions precisely

   and formally. This section develops the concepts in a mathematically rigorous way.

   The cornerstone of the development is the definition of the natural logarithm in terms of an integral.

   The  function      x                   is    then  defined   as   the  inverse  of  the  natural  logarithm.

                  e

   General     exponential                      functions       are  defined  in  terms  of      x  and  the  corresponding  inverse  functions

                                                                                             e,

   are general logarithms.

   Familiar properties of logarithms and exponents still hold in this more rigorous context.

Exponential Growth and Decay

      Use the exponential growth model in applications, including population growth and
      compound interest.
      Explain the concept of doubling time.
      Use the exponential decay model in applications, including radioactive decay and
      Newton's law of cooling.
      Explain the concept of half-life.

One of the most prevalent applications of exponential functions involves growth and decay
models. Exponential growth and decay show up in a host of natural applications. From
population growth and continuously compounded interest to radioactive decay and Newton's
law of cooling, exponential functions are ubiquitous in nature. In this section, we examine
exponential growth and decay in the context of some of these applications.

Exponential Growth Model

Many systems exhibit exponential growth. These systems follow a model of the form

y  =             kt  where  y0  represents  the  initial  state  of  the  system  and  k  is  a  positive  constant,  called

      y0e ,

the growth constant. Notice that in an exponential growth model, we have

Equation:

                                                                 kt

                                                 y = ky0e = ky.

That is, the rate of growth is proportional to the current function value. This is a key feature of
exponential growth. [link] involves derivatives and is called a differential equation. We learn
more about differential equations in Introduction to Differential Equations.

Note:
Rule: Exponential Growth Model
Systems that exhibit exponential growth increase according to the mathematical model
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                      kt

                                                                                                  y = y0e ,

where y0 represents the initial state of the system and k > 0 is a constant, called the growth
constant.

Population growth is a common example of exponential growth. Consider a population of
bacteria, for instance. It seems plausible that the rate of population growth would be
proportional to the size of the population. After all, the more bacteria there are to reproduce,
the faster the population grows. [link] and [link] represent the growth of a population of
bacteria with an initial population of 200 bacteria and a growth constant of 0.02. Notice that
after only 2 hours (120 minutes), the population is 10 times its original size!

Exponential Growth of a Bacterial Population

Note that we are using a continuous function to model what is inherently discrete behavior. At
any given time, the real-world population contains a whole number of bacteria, although the
model takes on noninteger values. When using exponential growth models, we must always be
careful to interpret the function values in the context of the phenomenon we are modeling.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Population Growth

Consider the population of bacteria described earlier. This population grows according to
the function f(t) = 200e0.02t, where t is measured in minutes. How many bacteria are
present in the population after 5 hours (300 minutes)? When does the population reach
100,000 bacteria?

Solution:

We have f(t) = 200e0.02t. Then
Equation:

                                0.02(300)

                      f (300) = 200e        80,686.

There are 80,686 bacteria in the population after 5 hours.

To find when the population reaches 100,000 bacteria, we solve the equation
Equation:
                             100,000 = 200e0.02t
                                       500 = e0.02t

                             ln 500 = 0.02t

                                       t=    ln 500   310.73.
                                               0.02

The population reaches 100,000 bacteria after 310.73 minutes.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem:

Consider  a  population  of  bacteria  that  grows  according  to  the  function  f (t)  =  500e0.05t,

where t is measured in minutes. How many bacteria are present in the population after 4

hours? When does the population reach 100 million bacteria?

Solution:

   There are 81,377,396 bacteria in the population after 4 hours. The population reaches
   100 million bacteria after 244.12 minutes.

Hint

Use the process from the previous example.

Let's now turn our attention to a financial application: compound interest. Interest that is not
compounded is called simple interest. Simple interest is paid once, at the end of the specified
time period (usually 1 year). So, if we put $1000 in a savings account earning 2% simple
interest per year, then at the end of the year we have
Equation:

                                                                               1000 (1 + 0.02) = $1020.

Compound interest is paid multiple times per year, depending on the compounding period.
Therefore, if the bank compounds the interest every 6 months, it credits half of the year's
interest to the account after 6 months. During the second half of the year, the account earns
interest not only on the initial $1000, but also on the interest earned during the first half of the
year. Mathematically speaking, at the end of the year, we have
Equation:
                                               1000(1 +                         2

                                                         0.02
                                                                     ) = $1020.10.

                                                            2

Similarly, if the interest is compounded every 4 months, we have
Equation:

                                               1000(1 +                         3

                                                         0.02
                                                                     ) = $1020.13,

                                                            3

and if the interest is compounded daily (365 times per year), we have $1020.20. If we extend
this concept, so that the interest is compounded continuously, after t years we have
Equation:

                                               1000 lim (1 +                              nt

                                                                n  0.02
                                                                               ).

                                                                      n

Now let's manipulate this expression so that we have an exponential growth function. Recall
that the number e can be expressed as a limit:
Equation:

                                               e = lim (1 +                       m

                                                              m     1
                                                                         ).

                                                                   m

Based on this, we want the expression inside the parentheses to have the form (1 + 1/m). Let
n = 0.02m. Note that as n  , m   as well. Then we get
Equation:

                                           nt                      0.02mt                                           m 0.02t

                    0.02                                 0.02                                                    1
                                                                                                                m
1000 lim (1 +          ) = 1000 lim (1 +                           )                          = 1000[ lim (1 +      )]                                                                  .

                 n  n                          m         0.02m                                m

We recognize the limit inside the brackets as the number e. So, the balance in our bank account
after t years is given by 1000e0.02t. Generalizing this concept, we see that if a bank account
with an initial balance of $P earns interest at a rate of r%, compounded continuously, then the
balance of the account after t years is
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                    rt

                                                                                           Balance = P e .

Example:
Exercise:
   Problem:
   Compound Interest
   A 25-year-old student is offered an opportunity to invest some money in a retirement
   account that pays 5% annual interest compounded continuously. How much does the
   student need to invest today to have $1 million when she retires at age 65? What if she
   could earn 6% annual interest compounded continuously instead?

   Solution:
   We have
   Equation:

                                                                            1,000,000 = P e0.05(40)
                                                                                                P = 135,335.28.

   She must invest $135,335.28 at 5% interest.
   If, instead, she is able to earn 6%, then the equation becomes
   Equation:

                                                                              1,000,000 = P e0.06(40)
                                                                                                  P = 90,717.95.

   In this case, she needs to invest only $90,717.95. This is roughly two-thirds the amount
   she needs to invest at 5%. The fact that the interest is compounded continuously greatly
   magnifies the effect of the 1% increase in interest rate.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem:

   Suppose instead of investing at age 25b2 - 4ac, the student waits until age 35. How
   much would she have to invest at 5%? At 6%?

   Solution:
   At 5% interest, she must invest $223,130.16. At 6% interest, she must invest

     $165,298.89.

Hint
Use the process from the previous example.

If a quantity grows exponentially, the time it takes for the quantity to double remains constant.
In other words, it takes the same amount of time for a population of bacteria to grow from 100
to 200 bacteria as it does to grow from 10,000 to 20,000 bacteria. This time is called the
doubling time. To calculate the doubling time, we want to know when the quantity reaches
twice its original size. So we have
Equation:

                                           kt

2y0 = y0e
     2 = ekt

ln 2 = kt

If a quantity grows exponentially, the doubling time is the amount of time it takes the quantity

   Problem:
   Using the Doubling Time

   Assume a population of fish grows exponentially. A pond is stocked initially with 500
   fish. After 6 months, there are 1000 fish in the pond. The owner will allow his friends
   and neighbors to fish on his pond after the fish population reaches 10,000. When will the
   owner's friends be allowed to fish?

   Solution:

   We know it takes the population of fish 6 months to double in size. So, if t represents
   time in months, by the doubling-time formula, we have 6 = (ln 2)/k. Then,
    k = (ln 2)/6. Thus, the population is given by y = 500e((ln 2)/6)t. To figure out when the
    population reaches 10,000 fish, we must solve the following equation:
    Equation:

                                                                                             (ln 2/6)t

                                10,000 = 500e

                                                                            (ln 2/6)t

                                           20 = e

                                           ln 20 = (   ln 2  )t

                                                       6

                                             t=        6(ln 20)    25.93.
                                                            ln 2

    The owner's friends have to wait 25.93 months (a little more than 2 years) to fish in the
    pond.

Note:

Hint

Use the process from the previous example.

Exponential Decay Model

Exponential functions can also be used to model populations that shrink (from disease, for

example), or chemical compounds that break down over time. We say that such systems exhibit

exponential decay, rather than exponential growth. The model is nearly the same, except there

is  a  negative  sign  in  the  exponent.  Thus,  for  some  positive                                   constant  k,  we  have  y  =  y0e-kt.

As with exponential growth, there is a differential equation associated with exponential decay.
We have
Equation:

                                                       -kt
                                           y = -ky0e         = -ky.
Note:
Rule: Exponential Decay Model
Systems that exhibit exponential decay behave according to the model
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                     -kt

                                                                                                  y = y0e ,

where y0 represents the initial state of the system and k > 0 is a constant, called the decay
constant.

The following figure shows a graph of a representative exponential decay function.

     An example of exponential
                  decay.

Let's look at a physical application of exponential decay. Newton's law of cooling says that an
object cools at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and
the temperature of the surroundings. In other words, if T represents the temperature of the
object and Ta represents the ambient temperature in a room, then
Equation:

                                                                                                                                   

                                                                                        T = -k (T - Ta).
Note that this is not quite the right model for exponential decay. We want the derivative to be
proportional to the function, and this expression has the additional Ta term. Fortunately, we can
make a change of variables that resolves this issue. Let y(t) = T (t) - Ta. Then
y(t) = T (t) - 0 = T (t), and our equation becomes
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                

                                                                                                   y = -ky.

From our previous work, we know this relationship between y and its derivative leads to
exponential decay. Thus,
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                     -kt

                                                                                                 y = y0e ,

and we see that
Equation:

                                                                                                   -kt

                 T - Ta = (T0 - Ta)e

                 T = (T0 - Ta)e-kt                                                                      + Ta

where T0 represents the initial temperature. Let's apply this formula in the following example.

   Problem:
   Newton's Law of Cooling

   According to experienced baristas, the optimal temperature to serve coffee is between
   155°F and 175°F. Suppose coffee is poured at a temperature of 200°F, and after 2
   minutes in a 70°F room it has cooled to 180°F. When is the coffee first cool enough to
   serve? When is the coffee too cold to serve? Round answers to the nearest half minute.

   Solution:

   We have
   Equation:
                               T = (T0 - Ta)e                                         -kt  + Ta

                               180 = (200 - 70)e                                      -k(2)        + 70

                                                                                 -2k

                               110 = 130e

                              11                    -2k
                              13
                              11   =e
                                   = -2k
                    ln

                              13

                    ln 11 - ln 13 = -2k

                               k=     ln 13-ln 11

                                                            .

                                                   2

Then, the model is
Equation:

                                   (ln 11-ln 13/2)t

                    T = 130e                                                          + 70.

The coffee reaches 175°F when
Equation:

                               175 = 130e                (ln 11-ln 13/2)t                          + 70

                                                                                 (ln 11-ln 13/2)t

                               105 = 130e

                               21      (ln 11-ln 13/2)t

                               26  =e

                              21   =  ln 11-ln 13

                    ln                                      t

                              26                   2

                    ln 21 - ln 26 =   ln 11-ln 13

                                                            t

                                                   2

                               t=     2(ln 21-ln 26)                                   2.56.
                                         ln 11-ln 13

The coffee can be served about 2.5 minutes after it is poured. The coffee reaches 155°F
at
Equation:

                               155 = 130e                (ln 11-ln 13/2)t                          + 70

                                                                            (ln 11-ln 13)t

                               85 = 130e

                               17      (ln 11-ln 13)t

                               26  =e

                                       ln 11-ln 13

                    ln 17 - ln 26 = (                    2                            )t

                               t=     2(ln 17-ln 26)                                   5.09.
                                         ln 11-ln 13

The coffee is too cold to be served about 5 minutes after it is poured.
Note:

   185°F. When is the coffee first cool enough to serve? When is the coffee be too cold to

   Solution:

   The coffee is first cool enough to serve about 3.5 minutes after it is poured. The coffee is
   too cold to serve about 7 minutes after it is poured.
Hint

Use the process from the previous example.

Just as systems exhibiting exponential growth have a constant doubling time, systems
exhibiting exponential decay have a constant half-life. To calculate the half-life, we want to
know when the quantity reaches half its original size. Therefore, we have
Equation:

          y0             -kt
          2 = y0e

          1   =e         -kt

          2

          -ln 2 = -kt

          t=             ln 2

                                .

                           k

Note: This is the same expression we came up with for doubling time.

Note:
Definition
If a quantity decays exponentially, the half-life is the amount of time it takes the quantity to be
reduced by half. It is given by
Equation:

   Problem:
   Radiocarbon Dating

One of the most common applications of an exponential decay model is carbon dating.
Carbon-14 decays (emits a radioactive particle) at a regular and consistent exponential
rate. Therefore, if we know how much carbon was originally present in an object and how
much carbon remains, we can determine the age of the object. The half-life of carbon-14
is approximately 5730 years--meaning, after that many years, half the material has
converted from the original carbon-14 to the new nonradioactive nitrogen-14. If we
have 100 g carbon-14 today, how much is left in 50 years? If an artifact that originally
contained 100 g of carbon now contains 10 g of carbon, how old is it? Round the answer
to the nearest hundred years.

Solution:

We have
Equation:

                           5730 =      ln 2
                                   k=
                                         k

                                        ln 2

                                                 .

                                       5730

So, the model says
Equation:

                               -(ln 2/5730)t

                       y = 100e                        .

In 50 years, we have
Equation:

                                                                -(ln 2/5730)(50)

                       y = 100e
                               99.40.

Therefore, in 50 years, 99.40 g of carbon-14 remains.

To determine the age of the artifact, we must solve
Equation:

                                                                    -(ln 2/5730)t

                       10 = 100e

                       1     -(ln 2/5730)t

                       10  =e

                          t  19035.
The artifact is about 19,000 years old.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem:

   If we have 100 g of carbon-14, how much is left after. years? If an artifact that originally
   contained 100 g of carbon now contains 20g of carbon, how old is it? Round the answer
   to the nearest hundred years.

   Solution:

   A total of 94.13 g of carbon remains. The artifact is approximately 13,300 years old.

Key Concepts

Exponential growth and exponential decay are two of the most common applications of

exponential functions.

Systems  that  exhibit  exponential  growth  follow    a  model    of  the  form  y  =             kt

                                                                                        y0e .

In exponential growth, the rate of growth is proportional to the quantity present. In other

words, y = ky.

Systems that exhibit exponential growth have a constant doubling time, which is given by

(ln 2)/k.

Systems  that  exhibit  exponential  decay  follow  a  model       of  the  form  y  =  y0e-kt.

Systems that exhibit exponential decay have a constant half-life, which is given by

(ln 2)/k.

We were introduced to hyperbolic functions in Introduction to Functions and Graphs, along with
some of their basic properties. In this section, we look at differentiation and integration formulas for
the hyperbolic functions and their inverses.

Derivatives and Integrals of the Hyperbolic Functions

Recall that the hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine are defined as
Equation:

          x     -x                                     x                 -x
          e -e                    e +e

sinh x =            and cosh x =                                             .

             2                                                        2

The other hyperbolic functions are then defined in terms of sinh x and cosh x. The graphs of the
hyperbolic functions are shown in the following figure.
Graphs of the hyperbolic functions.

It is easy to develop differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions. For example, looking at
sinh x we have
Equation:

 d                 d ex -e-x

      (sinh x)  =  dx  (   2     )

dx

                   1   d      x     d   -x
                =[         (e ) -       (e )]

                   2   dx           dx

                   1   x      -x
                = [e + e ] = cosh x.
                   2

Similarly, (d/dx)cosh x = sinh x. We summarize the differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic
functions in the following table.

Derivatives of the Hyperbolic Functions

Let's take a moment to compare the derivatives of the hyperbolic functions with the derivatives of
the standard trigonometric functions. There are a lot of similarities, but differences as well. For
example, the derivatives of the sine functions match: (d/dx)sin x = cos x and
(d/dx)sinh x = cosh x. The derivatives of the cosine functions, however, differ in sign:
(d/dx)cos x = -sin x, but (d/dx)cosh x = sinh x. As we continue our examination of the
hyperbolic functions, we must be mindful of their similarities and differences to the standard
trigonometric functions.

These differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions lead directly to the following integral
formulas.
Equation:

         sinh u du = cosh u + C                                   2

                                          csch u du = -coth u + C

          cosh u du = sinh u + C          sech u tanh u du = -sech u + C
                                          csch u coth u du = -csch u + C
                                 2

         sech u du = tanh u + C

Using the formulas in [link] and the chain rule, we get

Calculus of Inverse Hyperbolic Functions

Looking at the graphs of the hyperbolic functions, we see that with appropriate range restrictions,
they all have inverses. Most of the necessary range restrictions can be discerned by close
examination of the graphs. The domains and ranges of the inverse hyperbolic functions are
summarized in the following table.

Applications

One physical application of hyperbolic functions involves hanging cables. If a cable of uniform
density is suspended between two supports without any load other than its own weight, the cable
forms a curve called a catenary. High-voltage power lines, chains hanging between two posts, and
strands of a spider's web all form catenaries. The following figure shows chains hanging from a row
of posts.

       Chains between these posts take the shape of a catenary. (credit: modification of work by
                                           OKFoundryCompany, Flickr)

Hyperbolic functions can be used to model catenaries. Specifically, functions of the form
y = a cosh (x/a) are catenaries. [link] shows the graph of y = 2 cosh (x/2).
A hyperbolic cosine function forms
       the shape of a catenary.

   Problem:
   Using a Catenary to Find the Length of a Cable

Assume a hanging cable has the shape 10 cosh (x/10) for -15  x  15, where x is
measured in feet. Determine the length of the cable (in feet).

Solution:

Recall from Section 6.4 that the formula for arc length is
Equation:

           Arc Length =                       b

                                                 1 + [f  2 (x)] dx.

                                          a

We have f(x) = 10 cosh (x/10), so f (x) = sinh (x/10). Then
Equation:

           Arc Length               =     b

                                             1 + [f  2 (x)] dx

Key Concepts

      Hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions.
      Term-by-term differentiation yields differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions. These
      differentiation formulas give rise, in turn, to integration formulas.
      With appropriate range restrictions, the hyperbolic functions all have inverses.
      Implicit differentiation yields differentiation formulas for the inverse hyperbolic functions,
      which in turn give rise to integration formulas.
      The most common physical applications of hyperbolic functions are calculations involving
      catenaries.
