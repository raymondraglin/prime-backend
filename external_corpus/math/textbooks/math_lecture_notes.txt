          1.1: Logic in Everyday Language

Watch the videos on Logic and take notes on these pages.

A Proposition is a statement that makes a __________________. It must be a complete sentence.

          Which of the following are propositions?
              a. Anka is sitting on the table.

          b. Where are you going after class?

             A proposition has two possible truth values: ________________or __________________.

A negation of a proposition makes the ___________________ claim.
             Write a negation of the following statements:
                  a. Anka is sitting on the table.

          b. The dog is not in the back yard.

A double negation is when a negated proposition is itself negated.
             Turn each statement into a double negation:
                  a. I will not wash my hands

          b. It is unlikely that there is an association.

Logical Connectors

Using AND, OR, or IF...THEN to connect two or more separate propositions into a single
statement.

Examples:
    · Ramesh has a cat AND Ramesh has a dog
    · Ramesh has a cat OR a dog
    · IF Ramesh has a cat, THEN Ramesh will get a dog

"AND" Statements - Conjunctions

An "AND" statement is true only when _____________ of the statements connected by the "and"
are _____________. If either or both are false, the "and" statement is false.

             Determine whether each AND statement is true or false:
                  a. Rabbits are fish and rattlesnakes have 4 legs
                  b. Math 105 is a PCC class and Portland Community College is located in
                      Oregon
                  c. Oprah Winfrey and Bill Clinton were U.S. Presidents

"OR" Statements - Disjunctions

In everyday life, "or" statements can be interpreted as inclusive (meaning either or both) or
exclusive (meaning either but not both).

    Determine whether each OR statement is inclusive or exclusive:
         a. Will you have the vegan or meat option at dinner?
         b. We want to hire someone who knows spreadsheets or QuickBooks.

In logic and mathematics, the "or" is always inclusive unless specified otherwise.

An "OR" statement is true when _____________ or _____________ of the statements connected by
the "or" are true. If both statements are false, the "or" statement is false.

          Determine whether each OR statement is true or false:
              a. Rabbits are fish or rattlesnakes have 4 legs.
              b. Math 105 is a PCC class or Portland Community College is located in Oregon
              c. Oprah Winfrey or Bill Clinton were U.S. Presidents

IF...THEN Statements - Conditional Statements
         Example: if the animal is a bird, then the animal has a beak.
         The "if" proposition is called the ____________________.
         The "then" proposition is called the ____________________________.

          Determine the hypothesis and conclusion in the example below:

          You'll be paid overtime if you work more than 10 hours today.
              a. Hypothesis:

              b. Conclusion:

Cara Lee                                                                     Page 2
MTH 105  Name:______________________________________

When is an "IF...THEN" Statement True or False?

An If...then is false when the hypothesis is ______________ and the conclusion is ________________.

An If...then is true for all other situations, including when both the hypothesis and the
conclusion are false.

Example: You make this statement. "If I get elected, I will reduce college tuition."

If the hypothesis is true - you get elected, there are two possibilities
    · If you reduce college tuition, the statement is ________________.
    · If you don't reduce college tuition, the statement is ________________.

Say the hypothesis is false - You don't get elected
    · The entire statement is not false because you didn't say anything about what
         you would do if you weren't elected, so it's ________________.

         Summarize If...Then rules

             · If TRUE, then TRUE  TRUE
             · If TRUE, then FALSE  FALSE
             · If FALSE, then TRUE  TRUE
             · If FALSE, then FALSE  TRUE

Does it work to reverse an If...Then statement?

Original Conditional Statement: If A, then B
Converse: If B, then A
Inverse: If not A, then not B
Contrapositive: If not B, then not A

             Which of these 4 statements are equivalent to each other?

                  a. Original: If you are not late, then you get coffee.

         b. Converse: If you get coffee, then you are not late.

         c. Inverse: If you are late, then you don't get coffee.

         d. Contrapositive: If you don't get coffee, then you are late.

Logical Equivalence                                                       Page 3
The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.

A Venn Diagram with Three Sets and Data
130 people were surveyed about the news sources that they
used on a regular basis.
The results are given in the Venn diagram:

  T represents television, I represents the Internet, and
  N represents newspapers

          a) Write a description for each of
          the eight areas.

          b) How many people used the
          Internet?

Another Venn Diagram Example: How do you know when to subtract?

A survey was given asking whether people like espresso and/or chocolate. People could
check one or both boxes. Use the results to draw a Venn diagram and determine how many
people did not like either chocolate or espresso.

    · 150 people were surveyed
    · 132 people liked chocolate
    · 96 people liked espresso
    · 78 people checked both boxes

Rounding - May be Review

Step 1. Determine the place to which the number is to be rounded. Circle or underline it.

Step 2. If the digit to the right of the number to be rounded is less than 5, replace it and all the digits
to the right of it by zeros. If the digit to the right of the underlined number is 5 or higher, increase the
underlined number by 1 and replace all numbers to the right by zeros. If the zeros are decimal digits,
you may eliminate them.

Percent means per 100, so depending on which way we are converting, we move the decimal 2 places
to the left or to the right.

Percent to decimal

50% means 50/100. When we divide this we get 0.50 or 0.5. Notice how the decimal is now 2 places
to the left.

Decimal to percent

0.25 is read as 25 hundredths, which can be written as 25/100. This is 25%. Notice how the decimal
place is now 2 places to the right.

A Problem Solving Process
    1. Identify the question(s) you're trying to answer. Do any research needed to understand
         the context.
    2. Identify the information you have and any information you may need. Look up or
         estimate any missing information. Estimate the range of reasonable answers.
    3. Brainstorm and try out different mathematical tools to see what might be helpful. Use
         manipulatives, visuals or tables whenever possible. All ideas are useful, even if they
         don't work out.
    4. Choose one method to continue and get a potential solution.
    5. Check whether your solution makes sense. Is it reasonable? Can you get there a
         different way to confirm your answer? Return to Steps 1-5 as needed. When finished,
         explain your conclusion.

                        5.1: Apportionment

Apportionment is the problem of dividing up a fixed number of people or items among
groups of different sizes. For example, we use apportionment to determine the number of
representatives for each state in the US House of Representatives, or to divide school busses
among districts.

Rules of Apportionment

1. The people/items can only be divided into                                                   .

2. We must use the                            of people/items being divided.

3. Each group must get                        of the people/items being divided up.

4. The number of people/items assigned to each group should be                             to

the size of the group. (Exact is rarely possible so get as close as possible).

Apportionment Methods and Steps

1. Divide the total population by the number of items to find the divisor: The number of
people each person should represent (decimal).

2. Divide the population of each group by the divisor to get the standard quota.

Hamilton's Method (vetoed in 1792, used from 1850-1900): Cut off decimal to find
the initial number. Then give any extra seats in order of the highest decimal remainders.

Jefferson's Method (used from 1792-1830): Cut off the decimal to find the initial
number. Lower the divisor if needed so that there are no leftover seats. Uses trial and
error.

Webster's Method (used in 1840): Instead of cutting off the decimal, round it to find the
initial number. Then raise or lower the divisor if needed so there are no leftover seats.

Hill-Huntington Method (used 1941-present): Instead of rounding using 0.5 or higher,

use the geometric mean ( + 1) to round the initial number. Then raise or lower the
divisor if needed so there are no leftover seats.

It is important to acknowledge slavery in the U. S. when these methods were formed. In the
textbook I encourage you to read about the 3/5 Compromise and Hamilton, Jefferson and
Webster's relationship to slavery. In the 3/5 compromise, only 3/5 of the slave population was
counted for representation. When the slaves were freed in 1863, they were counted as whole
people. Black men were given the right to vote in 1869 and all women in 1920, however,
there are still voter suppression measures for black people and other minoritized groups.

Proportionality and Fairness

There is nothing in our constitution or laws that says representation must be proportional,
but that seems like a basic measure of fairness.

a. If a state with 10 districts is 3 Democrats and 2 Republicans, how many seats would
                               5              5
each party get if the representation was proportional?

b. If a state with 9 districts is 42.3% Democrats and 57.7% Republicans, how many seats
    would each party get if the representation was proportional? It usually doesn't come
    out exactly so you can say what is closest to fair.

How to Measure Gerrymandering: The Efficiency Gap

Example 1. The votes are shown for five districts in a hypothetical state. Determine the
number of seats won and calculate the efficiency gap.

Election Results:    District     D Votes     R Votes    D Wasted Votes  R Wasted Votes
                         1                75         25
Democrats win            2                60         40
              seats      3                43         57
                         4                48         52
Republicans win          5                49         51
              seats

Efficiency Gap = Party A Wasted Votes - Party B Wasted Votes =

Basic Types of Statistical Studies

Observational Studies
Example: Researchers examined health records of thousands of males to determine whether
there was a relationship between family history and heart attack.

Experiment
Example: Researchers want to investigate whether taking aspirin regularly reduces the risk of
heart attack. Four hundred people who identify as men are divided randomly into two
groups: one group will take aspirin, and the other group will take a sugar pill. At the end of
the study, researchers count the number of men in each group who have had a heart attack.

Treatment group:                               Control group:

Random Selection:

Placebo:                                       Placebo effect:

Single-blind:                                  Double-blind:

Observational Case-Controlled
Example: A group of disabled women aged 65 and older was tracked for several years, ending
in 2010. Those who had a vitamin B12 deficiency were found to be twice as likely to suffer
severe depression as those who did not.

         Subjects were separated into two categories:

Caution:

Margin of Error and Confidence Intervals
Example: According to a gallup.com poll in 2017, 29% of hourly workers and 41% of salaried
workers are completely satisfied with the amount of money they earn. The survey had a
margin of error of ±5%. Source: http://www.gallup.com/poll/216746/hourly-workers-unhappier-
salaried-job-aspects.aspx?g_source=WWWV7HP&g_medium=topic&g_campaign=tiles

Write the confidence interval for each group:

Hourly Workers:                                Salaried Workers:

Types of Bias in Statistical Studies
What is bias in general?

What is bias in a statistical study?

   Sources of bias
   Sampling bias - when the sample is not representative of the population

         Voluntary response bias - the sampling bias that often occurs when the sample is
         volunteers
   Self-interest study - bias that can occur when the researchers have an interest in the
         outcome
   Response bias - when the responder gives inaccurate responses for any reason
         Perceived lack of anonymity - when the responder fears giving an honest answer
         might negatively affect them
         Loaded questions - when the question wording influences the responses
   Non-response bias - when people refusing to participate in the study can influence the
         validity of the outcome

In each situation, identify a potential source of bias

   a. A survey asks how many sexual partners a person has had in the last year

b. A radio station asks readers to phone in their choice in a daily poll.

c. A substitute teacher wants to know how students in the class did on their last test. The
    teacher asks the 10 students sitting in the front row to state their latest test score.

d. High school students are asked if they have consumed alcohol in the last two weeks.

e. The Beef Council releases a study stating that consuming red meat poses little
    cardiovascular risk.

f. A poll asks, "Do you support a new transportation tax, or would you prefer to see our
   public transportation system fall apart?"

Description

Example

Types of Graphs

Graphing Qualitative Data
Example 1. A movie review website lists eight 5-star films, nineteen 4-star films, twelve 3-star
films, seven 2-star films, and four 1-star films.

a. Make a frequency table for the data.

Movie     Frequency  Relative Frequency      Cumulative Frequency
Rating          8
5-star         19
4-star         12
3-star          7
2-star          4
1-star
 Total

b. Create the table in a spreadsheet, and then make a frequency bar graph and relative
    frequency bar graph. Label the axes and give the graph a meaningful title.

c. Make a frequency and relative frequency pie chart using a spreadsheet. Label the axes and
    give the graph a meaningful title.

Please print your graphs from the spreadsheet as a pdf or insert them into word docs
and upload them with your notes.

                                4.2: Fundamentals of Probability

Three Types of Probabilities, Theoretical, Empirical, Subjective

Theoretical Probability- Based on counting equally likely outcomes

Example 1. You have a
quarter, a dime, and a nickel.
You toss them in the air, and
record whether they land on
heads or tails.

a. Draw a tree to see the
    possible outcomes.

b. Can you think of a way to
    multiply to find the
    number of outcomes?
    (Multiplication Principle)

c. What is the probability of getting 3  d. exactly 1 head?
    heads?

Theoretical Probability Model: We are interested in the number of heads, so we will list the
possible outcomes for the number of heads, along with the probability of getting each.
Number
of Heads

Probability

e. What is the probability of getting 1  f. What is the probability of getting
    or2 heads?                               fewer than 2 heads?

g. What is the probability of not        h. What is the probability of getting at
    getting 2 heads (Complement)?            least one head? (Complement of
                                             none)

Empirical Probability (Relative Frequency) - Based on observations or an experiment
15% of the parts sampled were found to be defective, so there is a 15% chance that a
randomly selected part will be defective.

Subjective Probability - Based on intuition, experience or feeling
What's the chance you will go to the party on Friday?

Relationship between Odds and Probability

Example 2. A team is given odds of winning of 4:7. What is the chance they will win? Lose?

Gambling Odds: "odds on" means "odds against"

Example 3. At a horse race, the odds on My Little Pony are given as 8 to 1. What is the
probability of My Little Pony winning and losing? The 8 to 1 odds mean that for every $1 you
bet on My Little Pony, you get $8 if you win. If you bet $10 and My Little Pony wins, how
much do you win?

                            Combining Probabilities

Example 4. You have 10 prizes in a bag and people are going to draw them at random. Two

are yellow erasers, one is a yellow calculator, three are green calculators and four are red

erasers. First, let's find the individual probabilities:

P(YE)=          P(YC)=      P(GC)=                        P(RE)=

P(Calculator)=  P(Eraser)=  P(Red)=                       P(Yellow)=  P(Green)=

"Or" Events (Single Draw)                                 "And" Events (Multiple Draws)

              Add          Add                   Multiply                    Multiply
( or ) = () + ()   Be careful not to  ( and ) = ()  ()                     Change the
                   double count the                                   probability for each

                      intersection                                             draw

"Or" Events
a. What is the probability of drawing a yellow or green item?

b. What is the probability of drawing a red item or an eraser?

"And" Events
c. If we put the items back in each time, (draw with replacement), what is the probability of

    drawing three red erasers in a row?

d. If we do not put the marbles back in each time, (draw without replacement), what is the
    probability of drawing three red erasers in a row?

             4.3: The Law of Large Numbers and Expected Value

The Law of Large Numbers:
In an experiment with independent trials, as you increase the number of trials the relative
frequency gets closer to the theoretical probability.

Example 1. Theo rolled a standard 6-sided die 1,000 times and recorded that the number 2
came up 100 times. He suspects that the die is not fair. Is he correct?

Gambler's Fallacy:
The mistaken belief that a streak or run of bad luck will make the opposite outcome more
likely.

Expected Value:
The long run average or mean value for many repeated samples.

The expected value is an        that is weighted by the                                      .

Example 2. A lottery ticket has five possible prize amounts and the chances of winning each
are shown in the probability model.

Prize                     $1 $10 $50 $1000                            0

Probability               1  1  1                            1  1539=0.7695

                          5  50 100 2000                        2000

a. Find the expected value for this lottery ticket.

         b. If the cost of the ticket is $2, what are your expected winnings?

Example 3. Primo Insurance sells an annual car insurance policy for $1,350. Based on past
data collected, an average of 1 in 50 policyholders will file a $6,000 claim, an average of 1 in
100 policyholders will file a $15,000 claim, and an average of 1 in 300 policyholders will file a
$33,000 claim.

         Insurance Payout
         Probability

         a. Find the expected value for the amount that Primo will pay per policy.

         b. What is the expected profit or loss per policy?              Page 4
