NUMBERS, OPERATIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS

      Numbers are wonderful. We need them every day in our lives.
      Welcome to the wonderful world of numbers, figures and symbols. We
      hope to travel with you on the journey of exploration in the world of
      numbers, so let's start.

1. COUNTING IN THE EVERYDAY WORLD

      In the Foundation Phase you learnt to count to at least 1 000. See how
      well you can complete the following exercise:
      Each day airlines need to work with many numbers. Imagine you are a
      member of a ground crew and you are counting paper coffee mugs for
      the passengers on an aircraft.

1.1 You are counting them in 2s and have reached 592. Write down the next
five numbers:

1.2 Now you decide it is quicker to count them in 5s. You reach 980. Write
down the next five numbers:

1.3 You are still counting paper cups for the aircraft but now you decide to
count them in tens. You have reached 660. Write down the next five
numbers:

1.4 Now you are in a hurry! You count them in 25s. You reach 725. Write
down the next five numbers:

1.5 You have enough paper cups for a month! Count them in 50s from 800
to one thousand and fifty and write down these numbers:

1.6 The plane is about to take off! Now you are really in a hurry! Count
them in hundreds from 0 to 1 100 and write down the last five numbers:

1.7 The distance from Cape Town to Johannesburg is one thousand, four
hundred and two kilometres. Write this distance in numbers:

2. MAKING YOUR CALCULATOR COUNT

      Now we know you can count to 1 000. Can you make your calculator
      count in 2s without pressing  2 each time?

HOW TO MAKE YOUR CALCULATOR COUNT:

2.1 Clear your calculator.

Press 2  = = = =

Some calculators need the command: 2   = = = = or

2  K = = = =
Get to know your calculator.

2.2 Make your calculator start at 1 004 and count on in 2s

Clear your calculator. Now press 1 004 + 2 = = = =

Some calculators need: 2 + + 1 004 = = = =

2.3 How will you make your calculator "count backwards"?

Clear your calculator. Begin with 7 190 and count backwards in 2s.

Some calculators need: 2 - - 7 910

Always remember to clear your calculator before you begin. Now you are
ready to begin the "Group Work".

You should do the next few exercises for five minutes each day for the rest
of the first term at least, until you find them really easy. Numbers may be
changed.

3. COUNTING FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS (Oral group work):

Now that you have learnt how to make your calculator count backwards
and forwards in intervals, check that you can still do so too, aloud. You may
work in groups. Only one learner in each group will be using a calculator.
Your educator will explain how to play this game, so listen carefully.

3.1 Count on in 2's from 186 to 204. Count backwards in 2s from 208 to
194.

3.2 Count on in 3's from 0 to 36. Count backwards in 3s from 36 to 0.

3.3 Count on in 5's from 375 to 425. Count backwards in 5s from 545 to
485.

3.4 Count on in 10's from 950 to 1 020. Count backwards in 10s from 950
to 840.
3.5 Count on in 25's from 625 to 1 000. Count backwards in 25s from 975
to 675.

3.6 Count on in 50's from 550 to 1 050. Count backwards in 50s from 750
to 350.

3.7 Count in hundreds from 400 to 1 100. Count backwards in 100s from 1
000 to 0.

4. COUNTING FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS (Individually):

      Now your educator may ask you to count individually. See if you can
      count forwards and backwards on your own. Your educator may ask
      you to start with larger numbers. Maybe you would like to practise this
      with a friend first. Use your calculator to experiment with, and start
      with larger numbers.

5. COUNTING WITH LARGER NUMBERS (Oral individual work):

      Remember to use your calculator as an investigative (learning) tool if
      necessary:

5.1 Count on in 2s from 9 980 to 10 000. Count backwards in 2s from 5 010
to 4 990.

5.2 Count on in 3s from 8 982 to 9 000. Count backwards in 3s from 1 836
to 1 800.

5.3 Count on in 5s from 4 870 to 5 015. Count backwards in 5s from 9 125
to 8 980.

5.4 Count on in 10s from 8 960 to 9 020. Count backwards in 10s from 5
100 to 4 980.

5.5 Count on in 25s from 7 625 to 7 750. Count backwards in 25s from 10
000 to 9 875.

5.6 Count on in 50s from 8 250 to 8 500. Count backwards in 50s from 9
750 to 9 500.
5.7 Count on in hundreds from 5 400 to 6 000. Count backwards in 100s
from 7 000 to 6 000
WRITTEN WORK.
Now use your calculator as an investigative tool and complete the written
work:
6. FLOW DIAGRAMS:

      Complete this "flow diagram" by following the arrows:

      Complete this flow diagram:
7. A DIFFERENT FLOW DIAGRAM:
      Fill in the missing operator, the input and output numbers:

8. MORE LARGE NUMBERS
Try to programme your calculator it to "count on" or to "count back" as
necessary: Complete the following sequences. Remember, you may use
your calculator if you wish.
8.1 10 000; 9 998; 9 996; , , ,
8.2 1 950; 1 960; 1970; , , ,

9. LARGER NUMBERS IN A FLOW DIAGRAM:

      Write down the missing input numbers, operator and output numbers:

10. COUNTING IN INTERVALS OF FOUR
      Now encircle all the numbers that you would use when you count in 4s
      up to 10 000.
Check with a friend, and, if necessary, a calculator.

WHOLE NUMBERS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS

Module 2

THE PLACE VALUE OF DIGITS IN WHOLE NUMBERS

Activity:
Recognise the place value of digits in whole numbers [LO 1.4]
Recognise and represent whole numbers in order to describe and compare
them [LU 1.3]
OUR MODERN NUMBER SYSTEM: THE DECIMAL SYSTEM

      Now that we have done oral counting exercises and mental
      calculations, we think about the meaning of our wonderful number
      system.
      See what Johnny says about Susie. This sounds strange doesn't it?
      1+ 1 is not eleven! But look at Roman numerals: I + I = II. Then it
      would be correct, because II is the way the Romans wrote 2. In
      Activity 5 we shall learn more about Roman numerals.
1. Now let's look at a bigger number. Just what does the number 1 111
mean, and why? Try to write down what it means:
One might say this is what it means:

2. What number do you think this diagram represents?
Our decimal system works in groups of loose ones (units), tens,
hundreds, thousands and ten thousands. We can have up to nine loose
blocks. If we get one more, we say we have ten blocks/ 10 that is, one
group of ten and nothing left loose. The "0" fills the empty place to say
there is nothing left. With blocks, it would look like this:

Because we cannot always draw blocks, we use the POSITION of the
digits to tell us the size of the group. So we have place value:

THOUSANDS  HUNDREDS  TENS  UNITS
1 000      100       10    1
10 x 10 x 10  10 x 10  10  1

Recap: Our Decimal Number System

In our number system we have nine symbols and "0". We use these
symbols, 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9 and 0 to make any and all the numbers we
need. We use the position of the digit in the number to indicate its value. So
in the number 2 768 the 7 means 700 because of where it is in the number.

If there are no thousands (or digits in the other columns) we use 0 as a place
holder.

Note: the 0 cannot be left out. If we left out the 0 the value of the whole
number would change (e.g. 10 291 would become 1 291) so the 0 is very
important.

   1. Now write each of the numbers below in EXPANDED NOTATION.
      The one at the top of the page looks like this: 2 768 = 2 000  700  60
       8

Now complete the ones below:
   2 768 = 2 000  700  60  8

   7 834 =

   2 056 =

   8 503 =

   1 940 =

   16 473 =

   25 809 =

Note also:
When we write big numbers we leave a space between the thousands and
the hundreds. This makes it easier to read the number. Key 10 403 into your
calculator. Unfortunately the calculator does not leave this space. Do you
see it is not so easy to read this number on the calculator when there is no
space between the thousands and the hundreds? Remember to leave the
space in the correct place when you are writing big numbers.
MAKING NUMBERS AND ARRANGING THEM IN ORDER

      We have seen how each digit in a number has a value, for example:
3 967 = 3 000  900  60  7.
It can be written in columns like this:

THOUSANDS1  HUNDREDS100 TENS10 UNITS1
000
3  9  6  7

Because there are:

3 × 1 000  9 × 100  6 × 10  7

4. Now create the largest and the smallest numbers with the digits: 2; 8; 4;
1. Write them and two other numbers, still using only the digits 2; 8; 4; 1 in
columns:

Which of your numbers above is the largest number?

      Now write your numbers. Begin with the largest, then the next largest,
      then the next largest, until you reach the smallest. This is called
      DESCENDING ORDER. (Moses DESCENDED from the mountain)

Descending order is when you start with the largest number and go Down

Example: 10; 9; 8; 7; 6; 5; 4; 3; 2; 1

4.2 Ascending order is when you start with the smallest and go up! Now
write your numbers in ascending order. Remember to begin with the
smallest:

4.3 Write these numbers from the smallest to the largest:

6 095; 9 065; 6 059; 9 506; 5 069

4.4 Write these numbers from the largest to the smallest:

8 315; 3 851; 5 318; 1 853; 8 513

5. EVEN AND ODD NUMBERS

5.1 Study the number line below:
All the numbers that have been written there are even numbers. They can be
shared equally between two friends.
5.2 Between the even numbers are odd numbers. They cannot be kept
whole and shared equally between two people. Fill in the names of the odd
numbers on the number line below:

TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE of odd and even numbers
a. List the even numbers between 2 800 and 2 812
b. Which odd number is just before 10 000?
c. What is the first even number after 2 998?
6. LARGER AND SMALLER
LARGER THAN / SMALLER THAN
In Mathematics, this sign > means: LARGER THAN or GREATER THAN:
This sign < means: SMALLER THAN or LESS THAN
(Remember, the crocodile always opens his mouth towards the largest
number because he is so hungry!)
500 > 400
or 500 is greater than 400
< 500
or 400 is less than 500
TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE SIGNS:

      Fill in the correct sign from : <; =; >
a) 0  4 * 11  3
b) 13  6 * 0  7
c) 2  7 * 14  8
d) 13  5 * 7  4
6.2 Write down the missing number when you count in tens:
1 470 < ...... .............. < 1 490.
7. CALCULATOR GAME
Now you may play another calculator game. Try to puzzle out what the
learners are doing this time. Then play the game with your friend.
Paul keyed in 187. He keyed in one operator and pressed = and the number
1 870 appeared on the screen. What operator did he key in? Yes, it was: X
10 because 187 X 10 = 1 870.

What operator did Reyhana key in? Yes, it was also X 10 because 1 870 X
10 = 18 700.

8. Now see if you can complete this table without a calculator. Then check
your answers with a friend. (If you get stuck you may use a calculator.)

Hello! I am called Six Thousand. I am part of a very large number, which
is: Sixteen thousand three hundred and twenty-nine.
9. Now write down the value of the digit that has been printed in bold type:
3 421
8 035
926
14 051
Now let us look at the number 2 848.
The 8 on the left means 800. The 8 on the right means 8.
What is the difference betweenthe values of the two 8s?
800  8 = 792
10. Now calculate the difference between the values of the numbers that
have been made bold and underlined:
7 374
6 995
3 023
5 519
10 010
11. Now you may play a "place value" game with a friend and a calculator.
This will strengthen your understanding of "place value". It is important to
play this game.
See if you can learn this game by reading what the two learners said:

The game continues until all the digits have been replaced by 0.
12. Now that you have played the "place value" game, try to do this
exercise. Replace the digit that has been made bold (dark) with 0. (The first
two have been done for you.)
Number,      My           Calculator   What

correct: 1 356  4 = 1 360 so we have replaced the 6 with a 0!

FINDING APPROXIMATE ANSWERS AND CHECKING ANSWERS

Now that you have studied "Place Value", we are going to look at
"Rounding Off" numbers so that we can use this to:

      calculate approximate answers quickly and also
      check our answers quickly.

1. APPROXIMATING, BY ROUNDING OFF

Consider the following:
1.1 You are riding your bike from your home to the home of a friend who
lives 10km away. Your tyre bursts when you have gone 4km. Will you
decide to walk home to fix it or go on to your friend?

Yes, you'll walk home because it's nearer. 4 is nearer to 0 than to 10

1.2 Now the tyre bursts when you have ridden 6km. Will you decide to
walk to your friend's home or back to your own home?

Yes, you'll go on to your friend's home because it is nearer.

6 is nearer to 10 than to 0.

1.3 Now the tyre bursts when you have ridden 5km exactly. Should you
decide to walk to your friend's home or back to your own home?

In Mathematics, always round off upwards if the last digit is 5.

      Now use the diagrams that we have just seen to help you to complete
      the table:

Number  Rounded off to the nearest 10
54
1 345
278
978
245
   1 133

   684

1.5 Now we are going to use "rounding off" to calculate, quickly, an
approximate answer for the following sums, and then we shall calculate the
exact answer, and compare the difference between the two answers. Fill in
what is missing in each column:

                                             the 2
            to the                           answers

1.6 Look at the sums that you have just completed. In which sums was the
approximate answer and the exact answer not very close, and why?

ROUNDING OFF TO THE NEAREST 100:

1.7 Complete the table below. .

1.9 Use rounding off to estimate the approximate answer of the following
sums. Then calculate the exact answer:

SUM with the   Sum with numbers rounded off to the nearest
exact answer.  10 and the estimated answer:

873 + 46

934  87

2. WORD SUMS

      Now see how well you can solve word sums without a calculator.
      Check that your answers are reasonable by rounding off the numbers,
      but remember that your final answer must be the exact answer. The
      numbers are not very big and the sums are straightforward, but you
      will have to read carefully. Write down all you need to write down, and
      remember to write words with your answer. When you have finished
      the sums, compare your findings with those of a friend. Enjoy this
      task.

2.1 In a General Knowledge Competition the Girls' Team scored 642 points
by tea-time. The Boys' Team scored 493 points. By how many points was
the Boys' Team behind the Girls' Team?

2.2 By lunch-time the Girls' Team had 734 points and the Boys' Team had
655 points.

   a. Was the Boys' Team catching up?
   b. Why do you say this? Answer carefully.
   c. By how many points was the Boys' Team behind the Girls' Team at

      lunch-time?

2.3 After lunch, the boys made a determined effort. During the afternoon
they scored another 619 points. The girls scored 519 points in the afternoon.
When all the points were added up, which team eventually won the
competition, and by how much?

3. CALCULATOR GAME: two players, one calculator
      Continue in this manner. If one of the players makes a mistake, correct
      it and then the other player gets an extra turn to ask a question. Keep
      the numbers not more than 4-digit numbers at the most. It's valuable to
      become very good at 2-digit numbers first.
      Complete:

a. 100 - 7 =

b. 1 000 - 7 =

c. 500 - 7 =

d. 500 - 17 =

e. 500 - 27 =

f. 700 - 70 =

g. 1 000 - 70 =

h. 2 100 - 70 =

4. SOME TECHNIQUES to perform written and mental calculations.

      How can one add 8 + 7 easily?
4.2 Discuss: which learner was right? What method must you use?

      You must use the method that you understand best, the one that you
      feel comfortable with, and you must also try to listen to others when
      they explain their methods. But be sure to use the method that you
      really understand well enough to explain to others what you did.4.3
      Try to see a link between these sums as you write down the answers

a. 8 + 7 =

b. 18 + 7 =

c. 8 + 17 =
d. 18 + 17 =

e. 8 - 7 =

f. 18 - 7 =

g. 28 - 7 =

h. 28 - 17 =

5. Now use your method and try some written sums. Write down all the
steps you needed to reach the answer. You may not use a calculator.

      87  54

      84  57
      Now discuss these two sums and their answers with a friend.
      Explain what you noticed.

6. Now calculate, without a calculator and using the method that you feel
you understand most. Write down all the steps of your calculation:

      1 345 + 278

      978 - 245
      1 278 + 1 133
      845 - 672
      684 - 659

      4 092 + 3 214

      Check the last sum by rounding off the numbers to the nearest 10 or
      nearest 100 and then calculating an approximate answer. Then discuss
      how you reached your answers with a friend. If necessary, check your
      answers on a calculator.

Module 4

FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND DRAWING UP A SIMPLE BUDGET

Activity:
To solve problems in context including economic and environmental issues such as: financial problems and
drawing up a simple budget [LU 1.6]
1. MONEY MATTERS
In the Foundation Phase you discovered how many cents, 2-cents, 5-cents etc. there are in R1. Now see how
clever you are!

   Question                                        Answer
   1.1 How many cents are there in R5?             cent
   1.2 How many cents are there in R50?            cent
   1.3 How many 5-cent pieces are there in R1?     five-cent pieces
   1.4 How many 5-cent pieces are there in R10?    five-cent pieces
   1.5 How many 5-cent pieces are there in R100?   five-cent pieces
   1.6 How many 10-cent pieces are there in R1?    ten-cent coins
   1.7 How many 10-cent pieces are there in R100?  ten-cent coins
   1.8 How many 50-cent pieces are there in R1?    fifty-cent pieces
   1.9 How many 50-cent pieces are there in R10?   fifty-cent pieces
   1.10 How many 50-cent pieces are there in R20?  fifty-cent pieces

Many shops do not use 1c pieces any longer.
2. SHOPPING FOR STATIONERY

Before school started at the beginning of the year, you had to do some shopping at the hypermarket. The
prices of the different items are shown in the next frame.

Sharpener                   R5   Felt pens (colour)  R10
Glue stick
Exercise book               R4   Geometry set        R20
Pencil crayons (small box)
Pen (roller-ball)           R3   "Flip file"         R10
Calculator
Diary                       R14  2 pencils           R8
Eraser
                            R15  Writing pad         R6

                            R49  Pair of scissors    R7

                            R15  Ruler               R5

                            R6

2.1 How much in total would each child have had to pay the cashier if he/she had bought the following items:

   a. Jane bought a diary and a ruler.
   b. Andrew bought a calculator, a writing pad and 2 pencils.
   c. Hetty bought a set of pencil crayons and a glue stick.
   d. Mandy bought a pen, a ruler, an eraser and a pencil sharpener.
   e. Brian bought an exercise book, a diary, a writing pad and a pen.

2.2 How much did all the above children spend on stationary altogether?

3. MONEY IN SHOPS

3.1 In the large shops, the prices of items include cents. Cashiers, however, do not worry with one-cent and
two-cent pieces. Cashiers always take your change up to the next 5c. Thus, if you should receive 17c change,
you will be given 20c. Change is always "taken upwards"; this is not rounding off. Why do you think shops
do this? Do shops lose much money because of this? Discuss this with your friends and then write down your
answer.

3.2 Now pretend that you are working behind a till in a shop. The till tells you how much change you must
give to each customer, but you must decide which notes and coins to give. You have to give the fewest notes
and coins possible.

Now complete the table (the first one has been done for you):
Notes and  Amounts of change to be givenR78,76 * R 30,45 * R 43,62 * R 21,94 * R120,13 *
Coins      R0,55
R100
R50        1
R20        1
R10
R5         1
R2         1
R1         1
50c        1
20c        1
10c        1
5c

3.3 Remember that it is the change is rounded off upwards, not the amount that the customer owes. If the
change should be R78,76, what is the customer actually given?

4. AT SCHOOL: BELONGINGS: GROUP DISCUSSION AND PROBLEM SOLVING

The "Lost Property" box was full of equipment! The educator was tired of picking up the belongings that had
been left on the floor and desks. She told the learners that, if nobody had claimed these belongings by the end
of the week, she would give the most well-mannered learners a chance to choose 2 different items from the
box and these would then be their property. For example, one combination might be a pencil and a ruler or a
pencil and a sharpener or a glue stick and a pencil There was much excitement as the learners tried to decide
which two items they would choose.

a. How many different combinations of 2 different items could they make if there were pencils, rulers,
erasers, sharpeners, glue sticks and pairs of scissors in the box? Try to write down a systematic way of
working out the answer. Then compare your method with that of a friend.

5. BUDGETS:

Should Grade 4 learners worry about a simple budget? Yes, they should become aware that it is necessary to
plan concerning one's money.

What is a budget? It's a plan to show what money will come in, and what will be spent.

5.1 GROUP WORK: AN INVESTIGATION

How do I go about drawing up a budget? See the budget lay-out below. Discuss it and then fill in likely
amounts.

BUDGET FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR PEOPLE FOR ONE MONTH
                                                                  Budgeted   Actual

EXPENDITURE (Spent)

What has to be spent each month:

      Rent
      Electricity and water
      Telephone
      Insurance
      Medical aid
      School fees
      Transport
      Food/ household
      Medical expenses
      Clothing
      Total:

Take the "Total Spent" away from the "Total Income". What's left for a holiday or entertainment?
(Now are you going to beg for another video and expensive "takkies"?)

      Now we shall do some practical research to complete a project.

PROJECT: BUDGETS: USE YOUR KNOWLEDGE

All the items mentioned in this project must be worked to the nearest whole rand. (So if Coke costs R15,99
you will call it R16.)

You and some friends are going to prepare the evening meal for Mother's Day. There will be twelve people
altogether at this meal. Your older sister says she will help you with the stove, and your father says that if you
have a braai, he will see to the fire. You earn money to buy food for the meal. Altogether you have R150.
Now you are going to draw up a budget or plan to show how you think you will spend the money.

a. First you need to decide whether you want to cook inside or have a braai. Look at the money! At the time
of writing, twelve lamb chops and some sausage could easily cost R100. On the other hand, if you made
savory mince or cottage pie or bobotie or spaghetti bolognaise, one and a half kg of mince would probably
cost about R25. Now make a list of all the things you want to buy.

   a. Now decide how much of each item you need. Write the amount next to the item in your list.

c. Now look at the advertisements of a local chain store in the paper, or visit a store and work out how much
each item will cost. Also decide which is cheaper e.g. tins of Coke or bottles, and which size you want.
Remember, you cannot spend more than your Income. Decide which items you simply must have.
Make a new list with the most important items first. Write down the amount and the cost of each item.
(Maybe you would like to consult an older person.)

Item  Amount needed  Price per unit                                            Total Price

d. Now draw up your budget by filling in the table below. First write R150 under " Actual Income". That is
all you have to spend! Now write down all the things that you want to buy under the heading, "Expenditure".
Start with the most important item. Write the total price of each item under the heading, "Cost in R"

BUDGET FOR A GRADE 4 BRAAI

INCOME               ACTUAL INCOME
Money earned         Cost in R

EXPENDITURE

   FINAL TOTAL
Now remember to take the amount spent away from the "Income". Is there enough
money for paper plates and cups?

TEST YOUR PROGRESS
Let's have another look at how you're coping.

You may use your calculator to find the answers in this section.

5. Read this sum carefully and answer the questions. Write down some proof to show how you reached each
answer.

A professional gardener, Mr Gouws, prunes 765 rose-bushes in July. Mr Greg prunes 648 rose-bushes in the
same month. In the first week of the next month Mr Gouws prunes another 165 bushes, while Mr Greg prunes
another 261 bushes. Then in the second week of August Mr Greg prunes 87 more bushes while Mr Gouws
prunes 184 bushes.

      In July how many more bushes did Mr Gouws prune than Mr Greg ?
      At the end of the first week in August was Mr Greg catching up to Mr Gouws? Give reasons to support
      your answer.
      Altogether, who pruned the most rose-bushes?
      How many bushes did both men prune altogether?

WAYS OF COUNTING IN LOCAL LANGUAGES AND DIFFERENT
CULTURES

Activity:
To describe and illustrate various ways of counting in local languages and different
cultures throughout history [LO 1.2]
Now you are going to explore the world of number names and symbols to see how our
number system developed.
1. NUMBER NAMES
1.1 You have been using numbers and counting on and counting backwards. See if you can
remember the names for the numbers in some of our South African languages. In the table
below write the name of a local language most commonly used in your area. Now write in
the words in that language for numbers 1 to 10.

1.2 GROUP WORK

When children learn to count, they chant the numbers and move rhythmically to the music.
Get together with some friends and make up a rap song to count from 11 to 20 in any
South African language. Present this song to the rest of the learners.

1.3 Now write number names of another local language most used in your area. Also write
the name of the language in the space provided in the second column.

Numbers  Other local language  Numbers  Other local language

   1.1 I have written in number names for 1 to 10 in a local language
   that is used most in my area.

   1.2 I have made up a rap song to count from 11 to 20 with my
   friends. We performed it for the rest of the learners.

   1.3 I have written in number names for 11 to 20 in a local language
   that is used most in my area.

   1.4 I have found out and written in the names for 100; 1 000 and
   10 000.

ASSIGNMENT

You may do this in your own time, at school and/or at home, as your educator decides.

NUMBER SYMBOLS: READING and RESEARCH

(Research is when you need to look up information and use it to answer questions. Ask
your educator to take you to the library to do the research in this section or use the
computer to look up information on the Internet.)

READ: The following information tells you about counting systems. Now test your skills
by answering the questions that follow.

2. Pre-history: People in ancient times
Thousands of years ago, before people could write, they had no knowledge of numbers
and figures and they had to find ways of indicating how many animals or possessions they
had. They put a small pebble in a bag for every animal they possessed, or carved notches
on a stick.

      Why did people start to need numbers?
      Draw a stick with notches carved on it to show that the owner possessed 5 sheep.

2.3 Besides carving notches on a stick, what else did they use to show how many animals
they possessed?

Ancient civilizations

3. The Babylonians

Many years later, people used signs or symbols to represent numbers. The Babylonians
who lived in Mesopotamia made wedge-shaped notches in wood or pressed such marks
into damp clay tablets.

RESEARCH: Ask your librarian to help you to find books with pictures and information
about the Babylonians and their wedge-shaped writing.

3.1 Now see if you can draw a clay tablet with the following numbers in wedged-shaped
writing: 1; 5; 10; 100; 1 000. Beneath each Babylonian number, write our number. (Use
your researched information to do this.)

3.2 What was this wedge-shaped writing of the Babylonians called? Ask the librarian to
help you to find the name in one of the books in the library.

4. The Romans

The Romans used a system that reminds one of the habit of counting on one's fingers. One
finger, for instance, represented number one. The V formed between the thumb and
fingers of an open hand represented 5. To write their numbers, they used letters.

4.1 See if you can fill in the missing explanations of some Roman numbers:

Roman    Explanation  Our
numbers               numbers

X              Crossed hands or arms                                    10

The Romans made great use of "more than" and "less than".
4.2 See if you can complete the following by using the previous table:

   (Note: In measurement 100 cm = 1metre)
4.4 What number did the Roman "M" represent?

   (Note: In measurement 1 000 mm = 1 metre)

5. The Ancient Egyptians
The Egyptians used a system of picture writing or pictography. The Egyptians' picture
numbers looked like this:
5.1 Study it carefully. The Romans used V and X a great deal. What number did the
Egyptians use to write many of their numbers?

      How did the Egyptians write 88? (Use the pictures above.)
      Now try to write 10 257 as the Egyptians would write it. (Maybe our number system
      is not so bad after all!)

Our numbers do not look at all like those of the Babylonians or the Romans or the Ancient
Egyptians, so from whom did we get our numbers?

6. The Hindu-Arabic symbols

At one stage they looked like this:

We obtained our 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9 from the Arabs. Our "0" came from the Hindu
people in India, via the Arabs, who adopted it. How would we cope without the "0"!
Imagine trying to write two thousand and ten in numbers without any "0s".

NUMERIC PATTERNS

Activity 1:

   To recognise and represent multiples in order to be able to describe, compare and represent
   them [LO 1.3]

   To investigate numeric patterns [LO 2.1]

   To describe numeric patterns in your own words [LO 2.2]

   To find output numbers [LO 2.3]

1. When we count in 6's we are saying the multiples of 6.

1.1 Work with a friend. One of you must count in 6's from 0 to 102. The other one must use a
calculator to check you and stop you if you make a mistake. If that happens the one with the
calculator must just say, "Stop!" and show the calculator. The counting goes on from there. Then
swap over.

1.2 Now fill in the missing multiples of 6 in the table below:

12  3  4  5        6 7 8 9 10 11 12

× 6 6 12 18 24 30  60 66
1.3 Now count backwards in 6's from 102 to 0. Let a friend check you. Then swap over. Do you
notice anything? Yes, multiples of 6 are all even numbers.
1.4 What patterns do you notice? Yes, the last digits seem to be 6;..2; ..8; ..4; ..0. They are
repeated and so form a pattern.
Now that you are aware of this, you can count in 6's for ever (if you concentrate)!
1.5 Count in 6's and complete the flow diagram:

1.6 How do we programme the calculator to count in 6's?
Press clear and
1.7 Write down the multiples of 6 from 102 to 0:
1.8 How do we programme the calculator to count backwards in 6's from 102?
Press clear and
Now you can really count in 6's easily, so let's move on to 7's.
2. Multiples of 7
2.1 Now use your calculator (if necessary) to count in 7's and complete the flow diagram:
Can you spot any patterns? Two are written below. Try to spot some more and discuss with a
friend.

      They are both odd and even numbers.
      They seem to be: odd, even, odd, even.

2.2 Now fill in the missing multiples of 7:

12  3        4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

× 7 7 14 21     70 77

There seems to be some sort of repetition after the first 9 multiples. Does it continue?

Are there any other patterns? Write down what you have noticed.

      Count backwards in 7's from 105 to 0. Use your calculator to do this if necessary.
      Write the missing multiples of 6 in the table below and then the multiples of 7 in the next
      row. Do you notice anything?

12  3        4  5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

× 6 6 12 18 24

× 7 7 14 21 28
2.5 Now compare the two rows (across) of answers. A very interesting pattern appears to be
emerging.
Look: 1 × 7 = 1× 6 + 1
5 × 7 = 5 × 6 + ......
9 × 7 = 9 × 6 + ......
2 × 7 = 2 × 6 + .......
6 × 7 = 6 × 6 + ......
10 × 7 = 10 × 6 + .....

   1. × 7 = 3 × 6 + ......
   2. 7 × 7 = 7 × 6 + ......
   3. 11 × 7 = 11 × 6 +......
4 × 7 = 4 × 6 + ......
8 × 7 = 8 × 6 + ......
12 × 7 = 12 × 6 +......
3. Multiples of 8
3.1 The numbers jump in 8 wholes. Use the calculator to count in 8's and write down the missing
multiples of 8.
0, 8, 16, 24, 32,......., ......., ............, ........., .............,............,.........., ............, .......,
........, ............, ......... .
3.2 Another way of saying: 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 is 4 × 8.
Now complete the flow diagram:
3.3 Spot a pattern. Write down the missing multiples of 8 in the table below and look at the last
digit of each one.

12        3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

× 8 8 16  80 88

Look carefully:
8; 16; 24; 32; 40; 48; 56; 64; 72; 80; 88; 96
If you are aware of the pattern in which 8; ..6; ..4; ..2; ..0; is repeated, and concentrate, you should
be able to count in 8's forever, without mistakes.

      Now, work with a friend. Count in 8's from 0 to 104 while your friend checks you on a
      calculator. Then swap over.
3.5 Now count backwards in 8's from 104 to 0 while your friend checks you on a calculator.
Then swap over.
4. Multiples of 9

4.1 Do what Sue suggested. Write down the missing multiples of 9 in the flow diagram and look
at the last digit of each one. Spot the pattern.
4.2 Counting in 9's is the easiest of all! Now complete the table below.

12             3  4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

× 9 9 18 27                                                               90 99

4.3 Now count backwards in 9's while a friend checks you on the calculator. Begin with 108.

Now you should feel comfortable when you count in 6's; 7's; 8's and 9's and you already know
how to count in tens. Practise this with a friend, forwards and backwards.

2. Ways of solving 7 x 8.

Example of solving 7 x 8.

      7 x 4 + 7 x 4 OR double (7 x 4)
      8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8
      Counting in 8's till you reach 7 x 8
      7 x 5 + 7 x 3 i.e. breaking up the 8 as we did previously
      2 x 8 + 5 x 8 i.e. breaking up the 7 to make it easier; I know 2 x 8 and 5 x 8
      Double 3 x 8 + 8
      7 x 10 - 2 x 7Be sure that you know what you are doing!

3. Now take each one that bothers you, and find a way of reaching the answer without a
calculator and write your solution in the table below.

My way of solving each problem:

e.g. 8 × 8  Double 4 × 8 =32 + 32 = 64
3 × 6       6 × 3 (I know my 3 times table) = 18

(c) 50 × 3 =  (h) 50 × 80 =
(d) 9 × 70 =  (j) 60 × 7 =
(e) 8 × 30 =  (k) 90 × 50 =

Activity 3:
To estimate and calculate by selecting and using a range of techniques [LO 1.1, 1.8]
1. You have found ways of calculating answers of tables that you have not memorized. Now
estimate the answer by rounding off. Estimations should be quick and easy, but they only give
approximate answers. Then find ways of reaching the exact answer of the following sums and
write down all your steps:
1.1 7 x 18

      24 x 6
Discuss your methods with other friends in your group.
1.3 36 x 54
Examples of methods:

      7 × 18
Estimation: 7 × 20 = 140; the answer is about 140
7 × 10 + 7 × 8 i.e. 7 times all of 18
Other ways of finding the exact answer:
or: 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 +18 + 18
or: 7 × 20  14
There are other methods. Try to think of them.
      64 × 35

i.e. all of 64 × all of 35
Estimation: 60 × 40 =2 400
60 × 30 = 1 800
60 × 5 = 300 i.e. add all answers
4 × 30 = 120
4 × 5 = 20
2 240
When you are really comfortable with this method, you can proceed to the old traditional vertical
method. Don't try to get there too quickly; more haste, less speed.
2. Word sums.
2.1 Share 54 Smarties equally amongst 9 friends. What does each one receive?
2.2 54 learners have to be transported to an Athletics Meeting. The coach wants to hire vehicles
that may take 8 passengers. How many vehicles will be needed?
2.3 A shopkeeper has 106 apples. He puts them on little trays to sell them in his shop. There are 6
apples on each tray. How many trays can he fill?
Some methods:

      9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 (How many 9's in 54?)
or: 54  9
9 × ? = 54
There are other methods

      54  8
6 × 8 = 48; 6 rem. 6, but they are people who have to get to the athletics meeting.
7 × 8 = 56
7 vehicles will be needed and there will be 2 empty seats on one of them.

      106  6
10 × 6 = 60
5 × 6 = 30
2 × 6 = 12
102
17 trays rem. 4 apples (The key word here is "fill".)
There are other ways. Discuss them with your friends and find the way that you understand best.
3. Calculate the answer. Write down the steps of your calculations, explaining (in numbers) how
you reached your solution. Then write down the steps which you used to check that your answer
is reasonable.
3.1 The mass of a van after it has been loaded is 2 500 kg. If the mass of the load is 500 kg, what
is the mass of the van when it is empty?
3.2 The mass of one bag of cement is 25 kg. How many bags of cement will there be if the mass
of the whole load is 500 kg?
3.3 The petrol tank of the van can hold 55 litres of petrol when it is full. The van needs one litre
of petrol to travel 13 km. The driver fills his tank with petrol. How far can he travel before he
needs to fill his tank again?
3.4 When the van is used for short trips around the town, it only travels 11 km per litre of petrol.
The driver fills his petrol tank, which holds 55 litres of petrol. How many kilometres can it travel
in the town?
3.5 Your school soccer team has to travel from Cape Town to Grahamstown to take part in a
soccer tournament. Your team can go by bus along the coast, a distance of 899 km, or you can go
by train via De Aar. The distance between Cape Town and De Aar is 762 km. From De Aar to
Grahamstown is 444 km.

How much further will you travel if you go by train?
3.6 A special tour to the Kruger National Park is arranged for 134 tourists from overseas. At the
rest camp 8 people can sleep in a rondavel. How many rondavels are needed for the tourists?
3.7 There is a tourist shop at the rest camp in the Kruger Park. In this shop special torches called
Bush Baby Lanterns are sold. Seven tourists buy a torch each and together they pay R273 for
them. How much does one Bush Baby Lantern cost?
3.8 On one side of the car park at the rest camp there is a straight fence consisting of wooden
poles. The upright poles for this fence are 3 m apart. There are 18 upright poles. How long is the
fence? (To understand the story, draw a fence with 6 poles - technique: substituting smaller
numbers in order to understand the story.)

SHAPES TO CUT OUT
Activity 2:
To recognise and describe reciprocal relationship, equivalence of division
and fractions, and the properties of whole numbers [LO 1.12]

What are fractions?

We have said fractions are equal parts of a whole. Fractions are numbers.
Twenty-five is a number; half is also a number.

   25 is not a 2 and a 5! 25 is twenty and five. Similarly we must think of

   a half as a number. It does not consist of a 1 and a 2; it is a half, a

   number.

   All the bits of   1  form a number.
                     2

   We learnt that twenty-five could be written in words or with digits: 25.

   Fractions can also be written in words or with digits: half or  1.

                                                                   2

What is a half? We take a whole and divide it into two equal parts. We
could take an apple and divide it equally between two girls: 12 =half

1  The line in the middle could mean  so 1  2
2

Half or  1  means 1  2
         2

   When we write fractions as numbers, the digit below tells us into how
   many parts the whole has been divided. The top digit tells us how
   many of those parts we are using.

Equation:

                        1
                        2

How many of those parts are being used (Numerator)
How many parts the whole is divided into (Denominator)
1. Each of the following bars represents one whole.
1.1 This bar has been divided into fifths.
a) Draw coloured lines on it to show tenths:

   a. Shade 10 3 of it.
1.2 This bar shows twelfths.
a) Draw coloured lines on it to show quarters.

b) Shade  3  of it.
          4

1.3 This bar shows fourteenths.

a) Draw coloured lines on it to show sevenths.
b) Shade  4  of it.
          7

Activity 3:

   To solve problems involving equal sharing with remainders [LO 1.8]

   To recognise and use equivalent forms of common fractions [LO 1.5]

   To recognise and represent common fractions in order to describe and
   compare them in writing and diagram form [LO 1.3

GROUP WORK

1. Read the following little story, then complete the questions and
instructions about it. You may work in a group or with a friend if your
educator agrees.

When the bell rang for break, Khanyi and Reyhana ran to their favourite
sunny corner of the playground. They sat down and opened their lunch
boxes.

"Oh my!" said Khanyi, "I've got six Marie biscuits today! I can't eat six
biscuits! I tell you what, Reyhana, let's share our lunches equally."

"That's a good idea," said Reyhana "I've got those bits of dried fruit. You
know, they mash up the dried fruit, roll it in sugar and cut it into bite size.
My mother has given me nine pieces!"

Just then two of their friends ran up and asked if they might join them. "Of
course!" said Reyhana. "We're going to share our lunches equally. This will
be fun. What have you got?"

Jill sat down and opened her box. "I've got two of those cheeses that come
in a round box," she said. "You know, they are triangles of cheese done up
in silver paper."

Themba said, "I think my mother was in a hurry today! She cut up an apple
into eight pieces and gave them to me for my lunch."

"That's good," said Khanyi, "There are four of us, so each of us can have
two pieces of your apple. Now let's share my six biscuits."

Questions and instructions concerning the story.

      There were four girls. Colour in how much biscuit ONE girl received.
1.2 How much biscuit did each girl receive?

1.3 Khanyi said each girl could have two pieces of apple. Discuss with a
friend or group: how much of the whole apple did each girl receive? Now
write your answer.
1.4 There were nine pieces of sugared fruit. How many whole pieces did
each girl receive?
1.5 How many pieces of dried fruit were left? Make a drawing to show how
the girls would share this equally.
1.6 Altogether, how much dried fruit did each girl receive?
1.7 There were two triangular cheeses and four girls. Discuss with a friend
or group how the girls would share these equally and draw in dotted lines
on the diagrams below to show how they did it.

1.8 What fraction of one cheese did each girl receive?
1.9 What fraction of all the cheese (two cheeses) did each girl receive?
Just then the bell rang for the end of break. When they were settled in the
classroom, their educator said, "Today we are going to consider `Equal
Sharing' and you may draw how to share things equally." Of course, our
four friends found the lesson very easy and their educator was pleased with
them. She wondered how they were able to do the work so quickly and
correctly. Only after the lesson did they explain how they had spent their
break-time!

Activity 2:
To count forwards and backwards in fractions [LO 1.3]
1. Group Discussion
Read the following and discuss who was correct:
The educator said, "Count in halves from 0 to 10."

Who was correct?

Actually both ways of counting were correct. Let's look at the way Peter did it.

1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 ; 5 What do you notice?
2  2  2  2  2

Yes, after the first two, the top part of the fraction is bigger than the bottom part.

What does this mean? Discuss.

Yes, it means that there is at least one whole hidden in there.

2  = one whole;  3  = 11            What do four halves mean? What do five halves mean?
2                2               2
When the top part of the fraction is larger than the bottom part, we call it an IMPROPER FRACTION.

5  is an IMPROPER FRACTION; the top bit is larger than the bottom bit.
2

Sometimes it is necessary to make improper fractions in calculations. However, most educators like the final
answer to a calculation to be a mixed number.

2. ORAL WORK: Now do these counting exercises. You may use either improper fractions or mixed numbers.
Ask a friend to check your answers.

2.1 (a) Count in halves from 0 to 10.

(b) Count backwards in halves from 100 to 90

2.2 (a) Count in thirds from 6 to 10.

(b) Count backwards in thirds from 30 to 25.

2.3 (a) Count in quarters from 12 to 16.

Activity 3:

To recognise equivalent fractions [LO 1.5, 2.1]

Two boys study a measuring beaker half full:
Who is correct? Yes, they both are. There is only one beaker and one quantity of Coke, but it can be called     1  and
                                                                                                                2

  500  ; thus, different names for the same quantity.
1 000

We say 21 and 1 000 500 are EQUIVALENT FRACTIONS.

The thousandths are smaller pieces, but there are 500 of them; enough to make a half.

1. Now see if you can work out the equivalent fractions here (Use the bars in the diagram if necessary):

       Half a sausage roll is equivalent to ............. quarters of an identical sausage roll.

Equivalence occurs when the whole may have been cut into a different number of parts, but there are enough of

them to make the same quantity as there is in the other fraction. We write it in words or with digits, thus  1  =  2
                                                                                                             2     4

and we use the = sign.

1.2 Half a sausage roll is equivalent to sixths of an identical sausage roll.

       Half a sausage roll is equivalent to eighths of an identical

sausage roll. Now make up one of your own:

       Half a sausage roll is equivalent to of an identical sausage roll.

2. Halves.

RECOGNISE AND REPRESENT FRACTIONS

Activity 1:
To recognise and represent decimal fractions [LO 1.3]
RECOGNIZING DECIMALS
1. What are decimals?
1.2 Think back to Place Value: Thousands; Hundreds; Tens and Units.
Complete the following:

   1 000  10 = 100
   100  10 =
   10  10 =
   110 = ?

1.3 Now check your answers on the calculator.

The calculator says that 1 10 = 0,1. What does 0,1 then mean? Discuss
with a friend.

1.4 Draw lines on the bar below to show tenths. One has been divided by
10. We say that 0,1 is one tenth. It is the only way in which calculators can
write one tenth, because of the way that they have been programmed. Now
label each section on the bar below 0,1.

What is the meaning of 0,1? We have found that 1  10 = 0,1.

Think back to Fractions: we said: 1  2 =  1
                                          2

So 1  10 =    1
             10

1  10 =   1  = 0,1
         10

0,1 is just another way of writing   1
                                    10

Study the diagram:

Thousands1          Hundreds100 Tens10 Units1 Tenths

Thousands1  Hundreds100  Tens10                          Units1  Tenths

            0            6                               9          1
7                                                                 10

5                                                                6

                                                                 1

How do we show the end of the whole number when there are no headings?

We use a DECIMAL COMMA.

What are the numbers that have been written in the columns?

7 193, 6 = 7 × 1 000 + 1 × 100 + 9 × 10 + 3 × 1 + six tenths

5 069,1 = 5 × 1 000 + 0 + 6 × 10 + 9 × 1 +   1
                                            10

Our calculators cannot write common fractions as we can; they are only
machines that have been programmed to use place value, so they can only
write decimal fractions.

Remember: We use a DECIMAL COMMA

to show the END OF THE WHOLE NUMBER

and the BEGINNING OF THE DECIMAL FRACTION

2. Now write the following decimal numbers in their expanded form under
the correct heading in the columns below:

2.1 (a) 1 456,3 (b) 4 601,9 (c) 8,5 (d) 31, 7 (e) 456,2
     X 1 000  × 100  × 10  × 1  × 0,1(tenths)

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

The FIRST digit after the decimal comma is always TENTHS.
2.2 Now write them again in their expanded form:
(a) 1 456,3 = 1 × 1 000 + 4 × 100 + 5 × 10 + 6 × 1 + 3 × 0,1
Activity 2:

2. Encircle the largest number:
43,7; 41,9; 43,1; 49,1; 41,5

Activity 3:
To convert from fractions to decimal fractions and vice versa [LO 1.5]
Group discussion.
1. Read the following conversation between John and Sarah.
     Was Sarah's answer correct? It did not seem to help John completely.
     Where did the ,5 come from? Discuss. Try to explain why half = 0,5
     on a calculator.
     Which of you were wide awake? All of you? Did you all know?
     Wonderful! Yes, it's because the calculator counts in tenths and five-
     tenths = one-half. The poor calculator has to use equivalent fractions to
     make tenths from things like halves and quarters and any fractions that
     are not tenths (hundredths and thousandths, but they come later).

With a calculator:

2. Make decimal fractions from the following:

2.1  3  = 3  4 = 0, ____
     4

2.2     2  = 25 =
        5

2.3 53 =

2.4 54 =

2.5 55 =

2.6 41 =

We can convert any ordinary fraction to decimals in that way.

3. Make one-third into a decimal:  1  = 1  3 =_____
                                   3

Can you think of a reason why the answer is the way it is?
Without a calculator:

4. Write down equivalent fractions for each of the following and then write
them as decimal fractions:

Fraction        Fraction as tenths  Decimal fraction
half            Can't
one third

Fraction        Fraction as tenths  Decimal fraction
two-thirds      Can't
one-quarter
three-quarters
one-fifth
two-fifths
three-fifths
four-fifths
one-sixth                 Can't
one-eighth

(Some of the above have more than one decimal place but it is good to
know about them.)

5. What about the thirds and sixths and others that cannot be made into
tenths? Use division.

one-third = 1  3 =
two-thirds = 2  3 =

Use your own method for the division or use a calculator.  1  = 1  3
                                                           3

Or one way: ? x 3 = 1

0 x 3 = 0,0

0,3 x3 = 0,9

0,03 x 3 = 0,09

0,99 (which is nearly 1)

so: (0 x 3) + (0,3 x 3) + (0,03 x 3)

0 + 0,3 + 0,03

= 0,333

(and the calculator will go on dividing: 0,333)

We say: 0,3 recurring or 0,3(The dot means recurring.)

learn to read, tell and write the time from analogue clocks

Activity 1:

      To learn to read, tell and write the time from analogue clocks
      [LO 4.1]

      To use time measuring instruments, including watches and
      clocks [LO 4.3]

TIME

We    know  that  there  are  365  1  days in one year. For your calculations
                                   4

in this module you may use 365 days in a normal year and 366 days in

a Leap Year. A Leap Year occurs every 4 years (four quarter days = 1

whole day). A Leap Year may be identified by dividing the last two
      digits of the year by 4. If there is no remainder, the year is a Leap Year.
      The year 2004 was a Leap Year. The extra day is always put in
      February.
There are 24 hours in one day. There are 7 days in a week
There are 60 minutes in an hour. There are 12 months in a year
There are 60 seconds in a minute.
SHORT FORMS:
year = a
day = d
hour = h
minutes = min. (remember: m = metres!)
seconds = s
month = mo
week = wk
In this module we shall also come across tenths and hundredths of a second!
Analogue clocks and watches show twelve hours only. They do not
indicate whether it's morning or afternoon.
Every hour the long hand goes right round the circle once. It counts the
minutes.
The long hand tells us the minutes.
The short hand tells us the hour.
The short hand takes twelve hours to go round the circle once. It tells us the
hour.

   1. Write down the time on each of the clocks:
Hands on: practical work

On the next page you will find two circles. Cut out the first one. Fold it in
half. Open it and shade one half. Write PAST in the half on the right and TO
in the half on the left. Now paste your cut-out on the circle below.

TO  PAST

When we read the minutes, the first half of the circle shows minutes past
the hour. When the long minute hand has gone halfway round the circle, we
say it is half past the hour. The second half shows minutes to the next hour.

Now cut out the second circle on the "cutting page" page. Fold it in half and
in half again. Open the circle and draw dotted lines on the folds. We have
divided the hour into 4 quarters. So we get a quarter past the hour and a
quarter to the next hour. Write A QUARTER PAST on the right side and A
QUARTER TO on the left side and paste your cut-out on the circle below.

   A QUARTER     A QUARTER
   TO            PAST

for cutting out
Read the instructions very carefully; be sure you understand before you do
each step.
Now we are going to write in the hours on the clock face. On the next page
there are two more circles for you to cut out. Cut out the first one. Fold it in
half. Fold it in half again. Do not open it. Now, fold the quarter in three
(like an ice-cream cone). Can you predict how many parts there should be
when you open it?

Yes, there should be 12 marks. Start with the top mark and label it inside the
circle: 12. Then work clockwise and number each fold in the circle. (Your
spaces between each number should be accurate because you made folds.)
You have now written in the hours. Mark each fold at the edge of the circle
and write in the number of the hour. (The first one has been indicated.)
Paste it on the first circle on this page.

Now (on the cutting page) cut out the second circle. Mark in the hours as
you did in the previous circle. Now you are going to mark in the minutes.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so how many minutes will there be
between the numbers? Yes, 5, i.e. 5 spaces. Put little marks to show them
and paste the circle on top of circle number 4. You have made an analogue
clock face.
For cutting out
TEST YOUR SKILLS: ANALOGUE CLOCKS
   1. Below each of the following clocks, write the time:
1. On the following clock faces, draw in the long and the short hands
  carefully to show the time that has been written below:

  22 minutes past 2
2.2 17 minutes to 10
(Did you remember that the hour hand is also moving, very slowly?)

2.3 a quarter to four

2.4 twelve o'clock
Analogue clocks cannot tell us whether it is morning or afternoon. We have
to say it is 9 o'clock in the morning, or 4 o'clock in the afternoon. We use
the following short forms:
a.m. = in the morning
p.m. = in the afternoon
Example:

A short way of writing 42 minutes past 10 o'clock in the morning is: 10.42
a.m. A short way of writing 36 minutes past 6 o'clock in the evening is:
6.36 p.m.

Activity 2:

      To learn to read, tell and write the time from digital and 24-hour clocks
      and stop watches [LO 4.1]
      To use time measuring instruments, including watches and clocks [LO
      4.3]

      Digital clocks tell how many hours and minutes have passed since
      midnight. They work from midnight to midnight; 24 hours. This is
      useful because as soon as we see more than 12 hours, we know the
      time is past noon, e.g.
      08:35The first two digits, the 08, tell us the hour if the hour is less than
      10.The last two digits tell us the minutes past the hour

This clock says 35 minutes past 8 o'clock in the morning (the 08 is less than
12).

Midnight would be 24:00.

One minute past midnight may be written as 00:01 or 24:01.

Noon or midday would be 12:00.

One minute past noon would be 12:01.

1. Write as digital time:

      ten past five in the morning:
      twenty past four in the afternoon:
      a quarter to ten in the evening:
      three minutes to one in the morning:
      8 p.m.
      one minute to ten a.m.
Study this example of a digital clock:
16:15
It shows the time, 4.15 p.m.
2.Now read the time on the analogue watch and write it correctly on the
digital watch (in the frame on the right):
2.1

(in the morning)
2.2
(afternoon)
3. Draw hands on the analogue clock face to show the same time as is
shown on the digital clock. Then write the time below the analogue clock to
indicate if it is morning or afternoon. (Use the short form.)

A twenty-four hour clock/ international clock

An international clock is based on the same idea as the digital clock.
This clock also works from midnight to midnight.
The half of the clock face on the right shows time before noon (midday).
The left half shows time from noon to midnight.

4.By looking at this clock, how would you know that the time shown on it
is in the morning?
A Stop-watch.
We use this at swimming galas and athletics and other sports events because
we have to measure decimal fractions of a second!
5. Write the time that is shown in the frame:
5.1 Swimming: freestyle relay: 4 x 25m:

   1:17,53
5.2 Athletics: 1500m:
   5:56,01

Activity 3:
To solve problems involving calculation and conversion between the
appropriate units of time [LO 4.2]
1. The annual Athletics meeting was held at school. The girls' times in the
100 sprint were as follows:
Joy 14,9 seconds
Doreen 15,2 seconds
Petra 14,7 seconds
Kathleen 14,6 seconds
Marie 14,8 seconds
Barbara 15,5 seconds
1.1 Who won the race?
1.2 Explain why you give this answer.
1.3 What was the difference between Kathleen and Barbara's times?
2. Mother puts a chicken into the oven to roast at 11:50. It takes an hour and
ten minutes to roast. When will she take it out of the oven?
Remember: there are 24 hours in a day.
There are 60 minutes in an hour.
There are 60 seconds in a minute.
3. Flight 502 leaves East London at 13:10 and arrives at Johannesburg at
15:30. Flight 504 leaves East London at 19:35 and arrives at Johannesburg
at 21:50.

3.1 Did the planes arrive in the morning, afternoon or evening?

Flight 502 ___________ Flight 504___________.

3.2 Which flight was the faster, and how much faster than the other one was
it? Write down your calculations clearly, step by step.

. 4. The workers in a car factory start work at 8 a.m. They work until 5 p.m.
with a lunch break of one hour and two tea breaks of ten minutes each. For
how long do they work each day?

Months of the year - old rhyme:

Thirty days have September, April, June and November;

All the rest have thirty-one,

Excepting February alone, which has twenty-eight days clear,

And twenty-nine in each Leap Year!

5. When we write dates the short way, we write the year, the month and
then the day, e.g. 2003: 01: 24 (24 January 2003)

The school year was as follows:

School Term  Term Starts  Term Ends
1            2003:01:22   2003:03:28
2           2003:04:08        2003:06:27

4           2003:10:06        2003:12:05

5.1 Write the date of the first day of the second term in full (the long way).

5.2 Write the date of the last day of the fourth term in full (the long way).

5.3 How long was the holiday between the first and second terms? Give
your answer in weeks and days.

5.4 How long was the holiday between the second and third terms? Write
down statements to show how you calculated this and give your answer in
weeks and days.

5.5 How long was the holiday between the third and fourth terms? Give
your answer in weeks and days.

      Study the morning high tides. Describe the pattern. Is it always like
      that?
      Do the afternoon high tides have a similar pattern? Write yes or no. .

6.3 High tide at Knysna is 43 min. later. When is the morning high tide at
Knysna on 30 June?

6.4 How much time goes by between the morning high tide and the
afternoon high tide on 28 June?

When we add or subtract time, remember that we are working with hours,
minutes and seconds.

60 seconds = 1 minute

60 minutes = 1 hour

Example: 1h 45min.+ 2h 36min. You will think of your own way to do this.

One way might be:

1h 45min. +2h 36min. = 3h 81min. (Notice: there is 1h hidden in those
minutes.)

= 4h 21min.

7. Calculate the answers and write down your calculations:
7.1 53 min. and 48 sec. + 14 min. and 34 sec

7.2 14 h 25 min.  7 h 36 min.

Activity 4:

To describe and illustrate ways of measuring and representing time in
different cultures throughout history [LO 4.4]

ASSIGNMENT (RESEARCH-BASED)

Your educator will help you to find reference books or take you to the
library when you need information in this Assignment.

1. Read the following information.

People in the Ancient World did not have clocks and watches as we know
them, but they did try to measure time. Some of their instruments for
measuring time included: a sun dial; a water clock; a candle clock; burning
oil and an hour-glass. Some of them were not very accurate.

2. Look up information in reference books or on the computer to find out
what these instruments looked like and how they worked. Also try to find
out which people used them and where they lived.

3. Choose four of the instruments named in number 1. Draw them and label
each drawing clearly.

4. Explain how any two of them worked.

5. Make either a water clock or a candle clock (or one of the others) and
show it to the class. Explain to the class how it works.

6. In the table below write down which people used each of the clocks you
have drawn and where they lived:
Name of clock  People who used it  Where they lived

Activity 1:
To recognise, visualise and name 3-dimensional objects in the environment [LO 3.1]
To describe, sort and compare them [LO 3.2]
Prisms, rectangular prisms, spheres, cylinders, pyramids, and other objects are found
all round us.
1. Study the following three-dimensional objects in order to learn their names and be
able to recognize and name similar objects in the world around us:

2. Objects in the world around us: now try to draw and name the 3-D objects:
Item                  Drawing  Geometrical name of the object

Cube of sugar (lump)
Tin of dog-food

   Ice-cream cone

   Box of matches

   Packet of cornflakes

   Triangular box of sweets

3. More shapes and objects.

3.1 Write each of the following solid objects under the correct geometrical heading:
The sun; a string of spaghetti; a block of ice; an ordinary candle; the handle of a
garden rake; a book; an orange; a brick; a block of margarine. Think of others and
write them in the columns too, especially the columns that seem to be rather empty.

3.2 Compare your lists with those of your friends. If they have an item that you have
not thought of, you may add it to your list.

Sphere  Cylinder      Cube  Cuboid        Pyramid Cone
                            (rectangular

      a block of flats
      the walls of a rondavel
      a wigwam/tepee
      the roof of a rondavel
      the stones at Stonehenge

5. Look at the objects again. How many surfaces are there? Are the surfaces flat or
curved? What shape are the surfaces? Fill in the missing words to describe the
objects:

      dimensional. In each shape below, fill in the road signs that you have seen in the
      world around you and on the way to school.
3.1 The Circle
3.2 The Triangle
3.3 The Square
3.4 The Rectangle
3.5 The Octogon

4. Cut out the TANGRAM on the next page. Cut out all the shapes in it.
4.1 Turn what's left of the sheet of paper over. Put the tangram together again to form
the original square without looking at the second tangram. Now turn the paper over
again and see if you did it correctly.
4.2 Now use the shapes to make:

   a. a boat,
   b. a human figure,
   c. a dog,
   d. other things.
4.3 Show your friends what you have made and discuss what you and they have
made.

DECIMAL FRACTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF
MEASUREMENT

Activity 1:

      To recognise and use decimal fractions in the context of measurement
      [LO 1.5]
      To estimate, measure, record, compare and order two-dimensional
      shapes and three-dimensional objects using S.I. units [LO 4.5]
      To estimate, measure, record, compare and order two-dimensional
      shapes and three-dimensional objects using S.I. units [LO 4.7]

1. Measuring Mass: grams and kilograms: 1 000 g = 1 kg

Hands on: practical work

You may work in pairs or groups for this work. You will need to look at a
new box of 100 tea bags and you will need a kitchen scale, one tea bag to
work with, a box of cornflakes, a packet of margarine and a brick. You will
also need a bathroom scale and a weight-watcher's scale if possible (so
work in a group and each one can bring two items of the above).

1.1 Estimate the mass of the box of tea bags. Pass it around the group. Did
some clever person look at the outside of the box? Yes, they have to write
the MASS on the outside.
1.2 Now pass the box of cornflakes around.

   a. What is its mass? .
   b. Which is larger: a box of tea bags or a box of cornflakes? .
   c. Which is heavier: a box of tea bags or a box of cornflakes? .
   d. Yes, it depends on the size of the box of cornflakes. One can get a box

      of cornflakes that has the same mass as 100 tea bags.

What would that mass be? .

1.3 Carefully take out one tea bag. Handle it carefully, as it can break easily.
Pass it around the group.

a) Estimate the mass of one tea bag. What do you think is its mass, when
you

hold it in your hand? .

b) Now discuss in your group: How can you calculate the mass of one tea
bag, using the information that you have at present? An adult is not to tell
you, please!

Hint: Look at the writing on the box. There's something there that can help
you.

c) Now use the weight watcher's scale to measure the mass of one tea bag.
What is it? (It's a small mass, and not so easy to read. Maybe your educator

can help you to read it.)

d) Use the kitchen scale to measure the mass of the box of tea bags and the
box of cornflakes. Is the writing on the outside of the boxes accurate?

1.4 Now, carefully, pass the brick around. Estimate the mass of the brick.
Complete the table, USING "GRAMS" OR "KILOGRAMS" as necessary.
Write in "g" or "kg":
Object     My estimation  Actual measured mass
1 Tea bag
Margarine
Brick
ME!

2. Measuring Length and Distance.

Hands on: practical work

You will need a tape measure, a ruler and any other measuring instruments
that you can bring (e.g. tape for measuring "Long Jump". You may work in
groups. In each of the following tasks, ESTIMATE the length and write
down your estimation BEFORE you actually measure. You may ask a
friend to help with the accurate measurement. Write your findings in the
table on the next page.

Recordings:

Item                    ESTIMATION  Actual
Round my head                       Measurement
Round my friend's head
My foot (length)
   My height (height)
   A very tall person:
   My eye-lash (length)
   My thumb-nail (width)
   My longest finger
   (length)

You probably used millimetres(mm) and centimetres (cm) quite often.
Know this!
10 mm = 1 cm
100 cm = 1 metre
1 000 mm = 1 m
1 000 m = 1 km
2.8 Estimate and then measure each thing listed below, and complete the
table below:

Item             ESTIMATION  Actual
Height of door               Measurement
Width of window
   Length of corridor/passage

   Distance to headmaster's
   office

   Length of rugby field

   Width of soccer field

3. Measuring Capacity (best done outside on the sports field).

Hands on: practical work

You will need: a measuring jug (ask Mum); a syringe, but NO needle (ask
the vet!); water and red colouring matter that you put in food (ask Mum); an
empty cooldrink tin; an empty milk packet; an empty bucket; a teaspoon;
your mug/cup; a baby's bath and other empty containers of liquid that you
find interesting. You may work in groups. Use the above containers to find
out how much liquid each item can hold. ESTIMATE first, write down your
estimation and then measure the actual amount.

3.1 Write all your answers in the table below.

Item                ESTIMATION(How  Measurement(How
                    much liquid)    much liquid)
The bucket

   Teaspoons in a litre
   packet

   A baby's bath

   A school
   swimming pool
   needs

You probably worked with millilitres and litres here.

Know this!

1 000 ml = 1 litre

3.2 Now put two and a half m of (edible) red colouring matter into a glass
of water. (Use the teaspoon or syringe). Stir, and admire the result. Taste it.
Does it taste like cooldrink? Discuss. (Some Foundation Phase learners
cannot understand this!)

4. Big pieces, small pieces.

Think carefully and put in the correct sign from >; <; =.

4.1 500 g ___________ half a kg.

4.2 62 mm ___________62 cm.

4.3 1 850 mm _____________ 2 m.
4.4 1 k ____________ 900 litres.

4.5 125 m_____________________ 125 litres.

Discuss your answers with a friend or other members of your group. Then
try to make up some similar questions to put to the class.

5. Converting units of measurement.

(Think back to Module 2: fractions and decimal fractions).

Length.

Remember: 100 cm = 1 m

1 000 mm = 1 m

1 000 m = 1 km

Look at the tape measure. Find 25 cm. It looks like quite a long piece
(nearly as long as a ruler). But it's only a part of a metre. We need 100 cm
to make 1 metre.

So 25 cm =   25  m or (25 ÷ 100) m. Now use a calculator:
            100

25 ÷ 100 =

25 cm =

25 cm are a part (fraction) of a metre.

Capacity.

Remember: 1 000 m = 1 litre

1 000 litres = 1 k

Look at 750 m of water in a measuring jug. It looks quite a lot, yet it's
only a fraction of a litre. We need 100 m to make a litre.
750 m =       750  litres. Use a calculator if necessary:
             1000

750 ÷ 1 000 =

750 m = 0, litres.

Mass.

Remember: 1 000 mg = 1 g

1 000 g = 1 kg

Hold a kg packet of sugar in your hand.

500 g = 0,____________kg. Use a calculator if necessary.

Now write down the missing quantities. Then compare your answers
with a friend and if necessary, check on a calculator (using division).

a) 125 mm = 0, _________mm

b) 843 m = 0, _________km

c) 65 litres = 0, __________k

d) 650 litres = 0, __________k

e) 450 mg = _____________g

f) 3 845 g = _________kg

5.5 Make up similar questions to put to the class.

Activity 2:

To solve problems using S.I. units [LO 4.6]

1. The following table shows the rainfall at the Helderberg Nature Reserve
in 2003. The records in this table are genuine records that are to be found at
a real place.

      Study the table and calculate and fill in the total amounts of rain for
      each month.

Month     Amounts of rain in ml in  Total amount of rain in
          that month                that month
January   17,4

July      17,4; 10,5; 16,0; 14,0;
          2,5

Check your totals with a friend. Do you agree?
Can 2,5 ml be fitted into a teaspoon?
How much liquid does a full teaspoon hold?
How full is a teaspoon with 2,5 ml of rain in it?
During which months was there no rain?
      In which rainfall area is this nature reserve: summer rainfall; winter
      rainfall; all year rainfall? Explain.

      How much rain fell in the Helderberg Nature Reserve during the first
      six months of 2003?

Write down calculations and answers for the following:

approximately 1 442 km; from Cape Town to Windhoek, which is 1 508 km
and from Windhoek to Maputo, which is 2409 km and then back to
Johannesburg, another 599 km. What was the total distance that he travelled
altogether?
4. At the end of a trip the odometer of a car of Easy Hire Car Hire Company

5. In Mother's shopping bag were:

500 g margarine; 1,2 kg mince; one 450 g tin of jam; 10 g yeast and 5 kg
flour. What was the total mass of all the shopping that she had to carry
home?

Activity 3:

To investigate and approximate perimeter [LO 4.8.1]

A ssignment:

You may do this in a group under the guidance of your educator. You will
need a ball of string, four sticks, measuring tapes and a trundle wheel.

1. Go outside onto a playing field if possible, and peg out a suitable hen-run
for your five chickens which your grandfather is going to give you. Discuss
the size of the run, its shape and position. Write down the measurements
that you decide upon.

Length of run: ________ Width of run: ________________ .

2. Then put a stick in the ground at each corner. Tie the end of the string
round one stick and unwind the string along the edge of your hen-run, going
round each stick until you get back to where you started. Cut the string and
tie it to the stick. Your string marks where you want to put a fence.

3. Measure how much string you used and write it down.

4. Return to your classroom. Draw a diagram of this hen-run on a clean
page. Give your diagram a heading and write down the length and the width
on your diagram.

5. Calculate how much wire-netting you will need to go right round the
hen-run. (You do not need a gate; you can step over.)
6. Challenge: Make a model of your hen-run. You may even make it to
scale. Ask your educator to help you. (Use a simple scale, e.g. 1 cm =1 m).

TEST YOUR PROGRESS

1. Complete the following:

      6 578 g = ____________kg
      5,703 km = ______________ m
      6 712 ml = ______________litres

investigate and compare two-dimensional shapes

Activity:

      To investigate and compare two-dimensional shapes by making them and
      drawing them on a grid [LO 3.3]
      To make two-dimensional shapes with a focus on tessellation [LO 3.5]

HANDS ON: PRACTICAL WORK.

You may work in pairs or in small groups. Use an old cornflake box (or other
box) to make strips of cardboard. They must be wide enough for you to be able
to punch a hole at both ends. Punch a hole at each end of each strip. Keep all
your strips in an old envelope and bring them to the lesson. Also bring a packet
of split pins to the lesson.

MAKING 2-DIMENSIONAL SHAPES: revision of properties and to test
rigidity.

1. Each group/pair of learners must complete the following and record their
findings on the dotted lines provided.

1.1 Triangles.

a) Make a three-sided figure by joining the ends of three strips of equal length
by using split pins. Place your triangle on a table or on the floor and hold the
corners. Is it possible to change the shape of the figure by pulling the corners
(gently)?
b) Make another 3-sided shape with two strips of equal length and one strip of a
different length. Pin it with the split pins. Again, place it on the table, hold the
corners and try to change the shape by pulling one or more corners. Can the
shape be changed?

c) Now make a 3-sided shape with three strips of different lengths. Pin it and
place it on the table. Gently try to change its shape by pulling the corners. Can
the shape be changed?

d) Pin two short strips of different lengths and make a square corner with them.
Use them and one more strip to make a 3-sided shape with one square corner.
(If you need to cut the third side to do this, do so.) Once you have pinned it, can
the shape be changed?

1.2 Your group should now have four triangles, all of different shapes, but all
with three sides. Use them to decorate the walls of your classroom. Make a
neat, large label: TRIANGLES.

      How many sides does any triangle have?
      Are the sides straight or curved?
      Is a triangle rigid, or can its shape be changed by pulling the corners?

      A shape that cannot be changed is said to be rigid. This is why triangles
      are used in the construction of the frame on which the roof of a house is
      built. A triangle is strong. Triangles may also be seen in the steel
      framework of bridges.

Any triangle has three straight sides and is rigid.

2. Quadrilaterals.

2.1 Use four strips of equal length to pin a 4-sided shape. Can it be moved to
have square corners and be a square?

2.2 Can the corners be pulled so that they are not square corners, but the shape
is still a 4-sided shape with all the sides equal in length?

2.3 Use two long strips and two short strips and see what different
quadrilaterals you can make. See if each shape can be changed by gently
pulling the corners. Your shapes should include the following shapes:
a) the _______________________

b) a parallelogram

c) the trapezium

d) the ____________________
Try to make other shapes with four sides. All the sides may be of different
length if you wish.
2.4 Can the 4-sided shapes be changed if you pull the corners gently?
2.5 How could you prevent this change from being possible?
Quadrilaterals have four straight sides and are not rigid.

3. Individual work. Use the shapes on the next page, your pencil and ruler, and
a pair of scissors to do the following:

3.1 Turn each triangle into a 6-sided shape (hexagon) by cutting off the corners.
Cut out your hexagons and paste them in the frame below. (They need not be
regular hexagons; the sides may differ in length, but there must be six sides.)

3.2 Turn each quadrilateral into an 8-sided shape (octagon) by cutting off the
corners. (They need not be regular octagons; the sides may differ in length, but
there must be eight sides.) Cut out your octagons and paste them in the frame
below.

Shapes for cutting out
Not for cutting out
The convex pentagon - (the points are all "outwards").

The convex pentagon - (the points are all "outwards").
Concave shapes look like this:
The concave pentagon - there are still five sides but one point "goes inwards".

4. Individual work: Use the grid paper on the rest of this page to make one of
each of the following shapes and colour it in:

      triangle
      quadrilateral
      pentagon
      hexagon - 6 sides
      heptagon - 7 sides
      octagon

(They do not have to be regular; the sides may be of different lengths.)
5. On the dotted paper below:
      Draw a triangle by joining six dots.
      Imagine that your triangle is a floor tile. Try to cover the paper inside the
      frame with identical triangles to the one you have drawn. No spaces must
      be left and there must be no overlapping. You may, however, flip your
      triangle over.

Example:

Here a space has been left to show you a flip. Remember that when you do it,
no spaces may be left.
My tessellation with triangles:
5.3 Tessellate with a different triangle:
5.4 Imagine that your rectangle is a floor tile. Try to cover the paper inside the
frame with identical rectangles to the one you have drawn. No spaces must be
left and there must be no overlapping. You may, however, flip your rectangle
over.
My tessellation with rectangles:

5.5 Tessellate with squares:
5.6 Tessellate with other quadrilaterals, e.g. kites or parallelograms:

5.7 Use the grid paper on the next page to see what other polygons can be used
to cover the floor without leaving spaces and without overlapping, e.g. regular
pentagons; regular hexagons; regular octagons.

INVESTIGATE AND APPROXIMATE THE AREA OF
POLYGONS

Activity 1:

To investigate and approximate the area of polygons (using square grids and
tiling) in order to develop an understanding of square units [LO 4.8]

      You know that when we tessellate, a flat space is completely covered
      without any overlapping and without spaces being left.

1. Square blocks covered by your hand.

1.1 On the grid paper below, carefully place your hand with the fingers spread
out. Trace around your hand with your pencil, stopping at the wrist. Lift your
hand. You will see a beautiful outline of your hand. We want to find out how
many square blocks your hand covers.

1.2 Put a dot in each full block as you count it, and write down the total number
of full blocks covered by your hand in the table on the next page. Now look for
places where half a block is covered. Two half blocks will make a whole block,
so put a dot in each and count them as one whole block. Write down the total.
Now combine those less than a half with those more than a half to make more
wholes. Write down that total. Now add the totals. That should give you an
approximate idea of how many blocks are covered by your hand.
Square blocks covered by my hand.

Whole   Half blocks                Other bits    Total number of
Blocks  made into                  made into     blocks covered by
        whole blocks               whole blocks  my hand.

1.3 Now colour in the shape of your hand on the paper.

2. Count the square blocks covered by the following shape in the same way.
First count the whole blocks. Then combine bits to make whole blocks. (Put
dots in the blocks as you count them, if it helps.)
   Total number of blocks covered: ...................... square blocks.
3. Count the blocks covered by the following polygons:

3. 1 _________ square blocks
3.2 _______________square blocks
Measure the square blocks with your ruler. They are 1 cm long and 1 cm wide,
so instead of calling them "square blocks", we can call them SQUARE
CENTIMETRES.
4. Now find the number of square centimetres covered by each of the following
polygons:

4.1_____________ square cm
4.2_______________ square cm
5. Let's pretend that you have made a doll's house for a younger cousin. You
have covered the floor of the bathroom with paper on which you have drawn 1
cm square blocks. There is a bath mat on the floor as shown below. How many
of the tiles are covered by the bath mat?

      Explain to a friend how you calculated your answer.
      Write down how you calculated your answer. Also write down your
      answer. Remember to write "square cm" with your answer. 6. In the family
      room there is a mat that is 4 m long and 3 m wide.
6.1 Draw a diagram to show what the mat looks like and label the length and the
width.
6.2 Calculate how many square metres of floor are covered by the mat. Write
down your calculation and the answer. Remember to write "square metres" with
the answer.
6.3 Now draw blocks on your diagram so that it is four blocks long and three
blocks wide. Check your answer for 6.2.
7. Dad uses 36 square tiles to tile the floor of a square braai area. He starts to tile
the floor by placing 6 tiles next to each other along the edge of this floor.
7.1 How many rows of six tiles each will he have when he has finished?
7.2 Draw a diagram to show what it looks like.
8.

      Can one make a square tiled area with 25 square tiles?
8.2 Make a diagram to show what it would look like.
9. Dad uses 736 tiles to tile a rectangular stoep. There are 23 tiles across the
width of the stoep. How many tiles are there down the length of this stoep?
Write down your calculation and answer.
10. Little 1 cm square tiles that look like Tiger's eye semi-precious stones are
used to cover a work surface in the kitchen. There are 75 of these tiles along the
length of this surface, and 54 tiles across its width. How many tiles are there
altogether?

1. Look at the following shapes (which can be made with cuisenaire rods or
toothpicks) and write down your answers:
There is a very obvious pattern. Predict what 1.4 will be.
That pattern is so easy because each time the pattern changes in the same way.
Spotting a pattern can save us time and energy when we calculate answers.
2. Now look at the multiples of 9 again. We have already noticed one pattern.
Maybe you noticed another? 9; 18; 27; 36; .....
Add the digits that make each multiple: 0 + 9 =____; 1 + 8 =____; 2 + 7 =____;
3 + 6 = ____

Is this true of all the multiples of 9? Try a few more. It can be useful if you are
not sure of a multiple. Some learners are not sure if 54 or 56 is a multiple of 9.
Which is it? ____

John knows seventy something is a multiple of 9. Help him: seventy-___ All
John has to do is to say: 7 + ___ = 9; the multiple is 72.

3. Complete the table by discovering and using the pattern:

3.1

Input  12  3  4    5 6 7 10 13

Output 7 14 21 28

3.2 This information could also be given in a flow diagram. Please complete the
flow diagram by looking at 4.1 again:
3.3 Write in words what was done: The input number was____________
4.
4.1 Complete the table and then describe to your friends what was done:

12  3  4    7 8 9 10 20 50

7 12 17 22

4.2 Put the same information from 5.1 in a flow diagram:

4.3 Write down in words what was done: The input number was ______
5.
5.1 Now find the "recipe" and complete this table:
1   2  3  4  5      6  9  11  12  20

3   5  7  9  11

      Write down in words what was done: The input number was ________
5.3 Now find the "recipe" to complete this table:

In     123       4     5 6 7 10 14

Out 3 7 11 15

      Write down in words what was done: The input number was _______

5.5 Why cannot this table in 6.3 be written in a flow diagram? Discuss this with
your friends and then write down your answer.

6. Other patterns involving numbers:

6.1 Add: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10

One can just add them in that order, or one can look for patterns. Just as we
paired the numbers on opposite sides of the dice, so let us pair opposite numbers
here: the first and the last and so on. It becomes:

1 + 10 and 2 + 9 and 3 + 8 and 4 + 7 and 5 + 6. What do you notice about the
totals?

_______ This can be shortened to: 5 × 11. Explain this to a friend. Where does 5
× 11 come from?

6.2 Add all the numbers from 1 to 20 inclusive. Look for a pattern and a short
way. Write down what you did and your answer on the dotted line below. Then
check your answer the long way. You may use a calculator to do so.
7. Another interesting pattern can be seen in the answers if you add:

      1 to 10 inclusive = _____
      11 to 20 inclusive = _____
      21 to 30 inclusive = _____
      31 to 40 inclusive = _____
      41 to 50 inclusive, and so on to 100. Write down the answers, study them
      and try to explain why this pattern occurs.

8. More patterns with shapes. The following pattern may be made with
toothpicks, one for each straight line.

Pattern: Each time we add one triangle, we need ______more toothpicks.
We could put our information into a table. Please complete it.

Number of   1 2 3 4 5 6 17 25
triangles

Number of
toothpicks

      How are the last two answers calculated? There are at least two different
      ways (without a calculator) and it is important that you should discuss these
      with your friends.

Hint: Maybe you could look at the toothpicks needed for six triangles and use
them to calculate how many toothpicks are needed for 17 triangles, or you could
think that you know the general pattern and just apply it to find out how many
toothpicks are needed for 17 triangles. Your discussion is important, so the
answers are not being given to you.The same applies to the 25 triangles.

8.4 Write down how you calculated the answers for

   a. 17 triangles
   b. 25 triangles

9. Complete the table:

In  12  3  4  5    6 10 20 50

THREE-DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS FROM THE
ENVIRONMENT

Activity 1:
To investigate and compare three-dimensional objects from the environment
according to geometrical properties by making three-dimensional models
using cut-out polygons
[LO 2.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 4.8]
1. Investigating nets: boxes.
You need a cornflake box, a box that contained tea and other boxes.
Carefully open the boxes where they were glued so that they can be laid flat
on the table. Examine the plan or net of the box.
2. Before you cut out the net below, fill in the dots for a dice on each face.
Then cut out the net, fold it into a cube and stick it with sticky tape. Look at
a real dice to see if your numbers are correct.
3. Cut out the shape below the table and fold it into a tetrahedron (a
pyramid) with three sides and a triangular base.

4. Now use the net of the cornflake box (rectangular prism), the cube that
you have cut out and the tetrahedron to complete the table:

Object       Number    Flat or   Number      Number
             of        curved    of corners  of
Rectangular  surfaces  surfaces  (vertices)  edges
prism                  (faces)
Cube
Tetrahedron
Activity 2:

To recognise and describe lines of symmetry in two-dimensional shapes
including those in nature and its cultural art forms

[LO 3.4]

1. PROJECT.

      Collect as many different leaves as possible. See if they could be
      folded in half. If they can, the fold is called a LINE OF SYMMETRY.
      Of course, the two halves must be identical. Paste your leaves on a
      piece of cardboard, label the line of symmetry and decorate the
      classroom with them.
      Collect wild flowers and do the same with them.

2. Shapes.

2.1 Cut out the shapes below. See if each of them can be folded in half. The
fold is called a LINE OF SYMMETRY. Use a ruler to make a dotted line on
the fold. Some shapes have more than one line of symmetry. Remember
that both halves must be identical. Draw in all the lines of symmetry and
paste the shapes on top of the shapes on this page. Label your lines of
symmetry.

2.2 Make other shapes, e.g. a circle, and fold them to find lines of
symmetry. Paste them on the clean sheet as well. Label the lines of
symmetry.
Activity 3:

To describe changes in the view of an object held in different positions

[LO 3.7]

If we see a large building from the front, we know that it will not look the
same if we see it from the back or from the side or if we are standing in
front of a corner of the building.

1.

1.1 Go outside and look at the school from the front.

1.2 Walk round to the back of the school and look at it again.

      Now walk to one side of it and look again.
      Finally, stand at a corner of the building and look at it again.
When seen from each of the above positions, the school looks amazingly
different.
2. Make the objects below with sugar cubes and look at them from various
angles.
3. Make some more objects with sugar cubes and examine them from the
front, the back, the sides and the corners.
4. Draw the following objects as they would look if you saw them from:
4.1 behind:

Front
4.2 from the left side:

Front
4.3 from the right corner:
Front

Activity 4:

To investigate and approximate volume of three-dimensional objects [LO
4.8]

      You may work in groups. Each group will need: various small boxes,
      e.g. a matchbox; a rectangular container for margarine; a shoebox, etc.
      (try to have five of them); sugar cubes (or 1 cm wooden cubes from
      the Foundation Phase).

1. Pack sugar cubes into the matchbox and fill it with the cubes. How many
do you need?

2. Now do the same with the other boxes and complete the table below:

Object (box)  Number of sugar cubes needed to fill the box
Matchbox

3. Measure the cube of sugar and record your findings:

      Length of cube:
      Width of cube:
      Height of cube:
4. The matchbox can contain ............. cubes; we say its volume is about
........... cubic centimetres.
5. When we measure what can go into the space in a container, we are
measuring VOLUME and we need three measurements: length, width and
height.
6. Instead of counting each little cube of sugar, what would be a quicker
way of calculating the volume of a box? Discuss this with a friend and then
write down your answer on the dotted line.
7. How many sugar cubes will you need to fill a box that is 20cm long,
15cm wide and 7cm high (a 2 litre ice-cream container)? Write down your
calculations and then compare them with those of a friend.
