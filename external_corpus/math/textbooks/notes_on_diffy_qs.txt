0.1 Notes about these notes

Note: A section for the instructor.

    This book originated from my class notes for Math 286 at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in Fall 2008 and Spring 2009. It is a first course on differential
equations for engineers. Using this book, I also taught Math 285 at UIUC, Math 20D
at University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and Math 2233 and 4233 at Oklahoma
State University (OSU). Normally these courses are taught with Edwards and Penney,
Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems: Computing and Modeling [EP], or Boyce
and DiPrima's Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems [BD], and this
book aims to be more or less a drop-in replacement. Other books I used as sources of
information and inspiration are E.L. Ince's classic (and inexpensive) Ordinary Differential
Equations [I], Stanley Farlow's Differential Equations and Their Applications [F], now available
from Dover, Berg and McGregor's Elementary Partial Differential Equations [BM], and William
Trench's free book Elementary Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems [T]. See
the Further Reading chapter at the end of the book.

0.1.1 Organization

The organization of this book requires, to some degree, that the chapters be covered in
order. Later chapters can be dropped. The dependence of the material covered is roughly:

              Introduction

Appendix A    Chapter 1

              Chapter 2

Chapter 3                   Chapter 7

Chapter 8     Chapter 4

              Chapter 5     Chapter 6
8  INTRODUCTION

    There are a few references in chapters 4 and 5 to chapter 3 (some linear algebra), but
these references are not essential and can be skimmed over, so chapter 3 can safely be
dropped, while still covering chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 6 does not depend on chapter 4
except that the PDEs section 6.5 makes a few references to chapter 4, although it could, in
theory, be covered separately. The more in-depth appendix A on linear algebra can replace
the short review § 3.2 for a course that combines linear algebra and ODEs.

0.1.2 Typical types of courses

Several typical courses can be run with the book. There are the two original one-semester
courses at UIUC, both cover ODEs as well as some PDEs. First course runs at 4 hours a
week (Math 286):

Introduction (0.2), chapter 1 (1.1-1.7), chapter 2, chapter 3, chapter 4 (4.1-4.9), chapter 5 (or
6 or 7 or 8).

    The second course at UIUC runs 3 hours a week (Math 285):

Introduction (0.2), chapter 1 (1.1-1.7), chapter 2, chapter 4 (4.1-4.9), (and maybe chapter 5,
6, or 7).

    A semester-long course at 3 hours a week that does not cover either systems or PDEs
will cover, beyond the introduction, chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 6, and chapter 7, (with
sections skipped as above). On the other hand, a typical course that covers systems will
probably need to skip Laplace and power series and cover chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3,
and chapter 8.

    If sections need to be skipped in the beginning, a good core of the sections on single
ODEs is: 0.2, 1.1-1.4, 1.6, 2.1, 2.2, 2.4-2.6.

    The complete book can be covered at a reasonably fast pace at approximately 76
lectures (without appendix A) or 86 lectures (with appendix A replacing § 3.2). This is
not accounting for exams, review, or time spent in a computer lab. A two-quarter or a
two-semester course can be easily run with the material. For example (with some sections
perhaps strategically skipped):

Semester 1: Introduction, chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 6, chapter 7.
Semester 2: Chapter 3, chapter 8, chapter 4, chapter 5.

    A combined course on ODEs with linear algebra can run as:

Introduction, chapter 1 (1.1-1.7), chapter 2, appendix A, chapter 3 (w/o § 3.2), (possibly
chapter 8).

    The chapter on the Laplace transform (chapter 6), the chapter on Sturm-Liouville
(chapter 5), the chapter on power series (chapter 7), and the chapter on nonlinear systems
(chapter 8), are more or less interchangeable and can be treated as "topics". If chapter 8
is covered, it may be best to place it right after chapter 3, and chapter 5 is best covered
right after chapter 4. If time is short, the first two sections of chapter 7 make a reasonable
self-contained unit.

0.2 Introduction to differential equations

Note: more than 1 lecture, §1.1 in [EP], chapter 1 in [BD]

0.2.1 Differential equations

The laws of physics are generally written down as differential equations. Therefore,
all of science and engineering uses differential equations to some degree. Differential
equations are essential to understanding almost anything you will study in your science
and engineering classes. You can think of mathematics as the language of science, and
differential equations are one of the most important parts of this language as far as science
and engineering are concerned. As an analogy, suppose all your classes from now on were
given in Swahili. It would be important to first learn Swahili, or you would have a very
tough time getting a good grade in your classes.

    A differential equation is simply an equation that involves not only an unknown variable,
but also its derivatives. You have seen and even solved many differential equations already
in calculus perhaps without knowing about it. Here is an example you may not have seen:

                                                 +  = 2 cos . (1)
                                                 

The unknown, , is the dependent variable and  is the independent variable. That is,  is a
function of . Equation (1) is an example of a first-order differential equation, since it involves
only the first derivative of the dependent variable. This equation arises from Newton's law
of cooling where the ambient temperature oscillates with time.

0.2.2 Solutions of differential equations

Solving the differential equation (1) means finding  in terms of . That is, we want to find
                                                                                    
a  function  of  ,  which  we    call  ,  such  that  when  we  plug     ,  ,  and    into  (1),  the  equation

holds; that is, the left-hand side equals the right-hand side. It is the same idea as it would

be for a normal (algebraic) equation of just  and . We claim that

                                           = () = cos  + sin 

is a solution. How do we check? We simply plug  into equation (1)! First we need to
          .                      
compute          We  find  that    =   - sin    +  cos .  Now   let  us  compute    the  left-hand  side  of  (1).

                      +  = (- sin  + cos ) + (cos  + sin ) = 2 cos .
                     

                                                                

                                          

Yay! We got precisely the right-hand side. But there is more! We claim  = cos  + sin  + -
is also a solution. Let us try,

                                            = - sin  + cos  - - .
0.2. INTRODUCTION TO DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS                                                                  11

We plug into the left-hand side of (1)

              +  = (- sin  + cos  - -) + (cos  + sin  + -) = 2 cos .

                                                                

                              

And it works yet again!

So there can be many different solutions. For this equation, all solutions can be written

in the form

                               = cos  + sin  + - ,

for some constant . Different constants  will give different solutions, so there are really
infinitely many possible solutions. See Figure 1 for the graph of a few of these solutions.
We will see how we find these solutions in a later section.

quite hard. There is no general method 3                                                                     3

that solves every differential equation. We

will generally focus on how to get exact for- 2                                                              2

mulas for solutions of certain differential

equations, but we will also spend a little 1                                                                 1

bit of time on getting approximate solu-

tions. And we will spend some time on 0                                                                      0

ing them.                                       -1                                                           -1

Most of this book is dedicated to ordinary

differential equations or ODEs, that is, equa-      0       1           2          3          4           5

where derivatives are only with respect to          Figure  1:  A  few  solutions  of    +    =  2 cos .
                                                                                       

this one variable. If there are several inde-

pendent variables, we get partial differential equations or PDEs.

Even for ODEs, which are very well understood, it is not a simple question of turning

a crank to get solutions. When you can find exact solutions, they are usually preferable

to approximate solutions. It is important to understand how such solutions are found.

Although in real applications you will leave much of the actual calculations to computers,

you need to understand what they are doing. It is often necessary to simplify or transform

your equations into something that a computer can understand and solve. You may even

need to make certain assumptions and changes in your model to achieve this.

To be a successful engineer or scientist, you will be required to solve problems in your

job that you have never seen before. It is important to learn problem solving techniques, so

that you may apply those techniques to new problems. A common mistake is to expect to

learn some prescription for solving all the problems you will encounter in your later career.

This course is no exception.

real-world problem we wish to understand. We abstract                          interpret

make some simplifying assumptions and cre-                        solve      Mathematical
ate a mathematical model. That is, we translate Mathematical                    solution
the real-world situation into a differential equa- model

tion (or equations). Then we use mathematics

to get some sort of a mathematical solution. There is still something left to do. We must

interpret the results. We have to figure out what the mathematical solution says about the

real-world problem we started with.

    Formulating the mathematical model and interpreting the results is what you do in

your physics and engineering classes. In this course, we focus mostly on the mathematical

analysis. Sometimes we will work with simple real-world examples to have some intuition

and motivation about what we are doing. Let us look at an example of the entire process.

Example 0.2.1: One of the most basic differential equations is the exponential growth model.
Let  denote the population of some bacteria on a Petri dish. We assume that there is

enough food and enough space. Then the rate of growth of the bacteria is proportional to
the population--a larger population grows faster. Let  denote time (say in seconds) and 

the population. Our model is          = ,
                                     

for some positive constant  > 0.

    Suppose there are 100 bacteria at time 0 and 200 bacteria 10 seconds later. How many

bacteria will there be 1 minute from time 0 (in 60 seconds)?

    First we need to solve the equation. We         0  10     20  30     40  50  60

claim that a solution is given by

                                              6000                                   6000

    () =   ,                                  5000                                   5000

where  is a constant. Let us try:             4000                                   4000

                 =  = .                       3000                                   3000
                 
                                              2000                                   2000
And it really is a solution.
    OK, now what? We do not know , and        1000                                   1000

we do not know . But we know something.       0                                      0
We know (0) = 100, and we know (10) =
200. We plug these conditions in and see            0  10     20  30     40  50  60
what happens:
                                              Figure 2: Bacteria growth in the first 60 seconds.

    100 = (0) =  0 = , so  = 100,
    200 = (10) =  10 = 100  10.
0.2. INTRODUCTION TO DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS                                                             13

Therefore,  2  =   10   or    =  ln 2    0.069.  So
                                 10

                                       () = 100 (ln 2)/10  100 0.069 .

At one minute,  = 60, the population is (60) = 6400. See Figure 2 on the preceding page.

Let us interpret the results. Does our solution mean that there must be exactly 6400

bacteria on the plate at 60s? No! We made assumptions that might not be true exactly, just

approximately. If our assumptions are reasonable, then there will be approximately 6400
bacteria. Also, in real life  is a discrete quantity, that is, a whole number. However, our
model has no problem saying that for example at 61 seconds, (61)  6859.35.

Normally,        the    in    =        is  given,  and  we  want  to  solve  the  equation  for  some   initial
                            
                                                                                  
condition.  For  example,     the  problem  could    be:  Solve  the  equation      =    (so     =  1)  subject

to (0) = 1000 (the initial condition). Then the solution is (exercise)

                                                 () = 1000  .

We call () =  the general solution, as every solution of the equation can be written
in this form for some constant . We need an initial condition to find out what  is, in
order to find the particular solution we are looking for, in this case, () = 1000 . Generally,

when we say "particular solution," we just mean some solution.
    In real life, parameters such as  must often first be somehow computed or estimated.

The example above shows how finding an analytic solution to the differential equation is

useful in finding these parameters.

0.2.4 Four fundamental equations

A few equations appear often and it is useful to just memorize what their solutions are. Let
us call them the four fundamental equations. Their solutions are reasonably easy to guess
by recalling properties of exponentials, sines, and cosines. They are also simple to check,
which is something that you should always do. No need to wonder if you remembered the
solution correctly.

The first such equation is                         
                                                    = ,

for some constant  > 0. Here  is the dependent and  the independent variable. The

general solution for this equation is

                                                 () = .

We saw above that this function is a solution, although we used different variable names.

Next, we have                                      
                                                    = -,

for some constant  > 0. The general solution for this equation is

                                                 () = -.
14                                                                                          INTRODUCTION

Exercise 0.2.1: Check that the  given is really a solution to the equation above.

    Next, take the second-order differential equation

                                                   2 = -2,
                                                   2
for some constant  > 0. The general solution for this equation is

                                     () = 1 cos() + 2 sin().

Since the equation is a second-order differential equation, we have two constants in our
general solution.
Exercise 0.2.2: Check that the  given is really a solution to the equation above.

    Finally, consider the second-order differential equation

                                                    2
                                                          = 2,

                                                    2
for some constant  > 0. The general solution for this equation is

                                            () = 1 + 2-,

or
                                     () = 1 cosh() + 2 sinh().

    For those who do not know, cosh and sinh are defined by

                              cosh  =   + -                              - -
                                                   ,    sinh  =                    .
                                             2                               2

They are called the hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine. These functions are sometimes

easier to work with than exponentials. They have some nice familiar properties such as
                                                                                            
cosh 0  =  1,  sinh 0  =  0,  and    cosh    =  sinh    (no,  that  is  not  a  typo)  and    sinh    =  cosh  .

Exercise 0.2.3: Check that both forms of the  given are really solutions to the equation above.

Example 0.2.2: In equations of higher order, you get more constants you must solve for to

                                                                                                                                                     2 

get a particular solution and hence you need more initial conditions. The equation 2 = 0
has the general solution  = 1 + 2; simply integrate twice and don't forget about the
constant of integration. Consider the initial conditions (0) = 2 and (0) = 3. We plug in
our general solution and solve for the constants:

                            2 = (0) = 1 · 0 + 2 = 2, 3 = (0) = 1.

In other words,  = 3 + 2 is the particular solution we seek.

    An interesting note about cosh: The graph of cosh is the exact shape of a hanging chain.
This shape is called a catenary. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a parabola. If you
invert the graph of cosh, it is also the ideal arch for supporting its weight--a parabola
would not work. For example, per the National Park Service, the exact formula used by the
architects of the Gateway Arch in Saint Louis is (a so-called weighted catenary)

         =  cosh   - 1 , where  = 68.7672,  = 3.0022,  = 299.2239.

0.3 Classification of differential equations

Note: less than 1 lecture or left as reading, §1.3 in [BD]

    There are many types of differential equations, and we classify them into different
categories based on their properties. Let us quickly go over the most basic classification.
We already saw the distinction between ordinary and partial differential equations:

· Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are equations where the derivatives are taken
   with respect to only one variable. That is, there is only one independent variable.

· Partial differential equations (PDE) are equations that depend on partial derivatives of
   several variables. That is, there are several independent variables.

Let us see some examples of ordinary differential equations:

                                        (Exponential growth)
 = ,                                    (Newton's law of cooling)
                                        (Mechanical vibrations)
 = ( - ),

  2 
 2 +  +  =  ().

    

And of partial differential equations:  (Transport equation)
                                        (Heat equation)
                  +   = 0  ,            (Wave equation in 2 dimensions)
                   = 2 2 ,
                 2  = 2 + 2 2 2 2 .

If there are several equations working together, we have a so-called system of differential

equations. For example,

                          = ,  = 

is a system of ordinary differential equations. Maxwell's equations for electromagnetics,

 · ì = ,                                 · ì = 0,
 × ì = -  ,ì                             × ì = ì +  , ì

                                                         

are a system of partial differential equations. The divergence operator · and the curl
operator × can be written out in partial derivatives of the functions involved in the , ,
and  variables.

    The next bit of information is the order of the equation (or system). The order is the
order of the largest derivative that appears. If the highest derivative that appears is the first
18                         INTRODUCTION

derivative, the equation is of first order. If the highest derivative that appears is the second
derivative, then the equation is of second order. For example, Newton's law of cooling
above is a first-order equation, while the mechanical vibrations equation is a second-order
equation. The equation governing transversal vibrations in a beam,

                                               4 4 + 2 = 0,
                                                   4 2

is a fourth-order partial differential equation. It is of fourth order as at least one derivative
is the fourth derivative. It does not matter that the derivative in  is only of second order.

    In the first chapter, we will start attacking first-order ordinary differential equations,
that is, equations of the form   =  (, ). In general, lower-order equations are easier to
work with and have simpler behavior, which is why we start with them.

    We also distinguish how the dependent variables appear in the equation (or system). In
particular, an equation is linear if the dependent variable (or variables) and their derivatives
appear linearly, that is, only as first powers, they are not multiplied together, and no other
functions of the dependent variables appear. The equation is a sum of terms, where each
term is a function of the independent variables or a function of the independent variables
multiplied by a dependent variable or one of its derivatives. An ordinary differential
equation is linear if it can be put into the form

         -1          
    ()  + -1() -1 + · · · + 1()  + 0() = (). (2)

The functions 0, 1, . . . ,  are called the coefficients. The equation is allowed to depend
arbitrarily on the independent variable. So

        2      2 1
        2 + sin() +   =    (3)
                         

is a linear equation as  and its derivatives only appear linearly.
    All the equations and systems given as examples above are linear. Linearity may not be

immediately obvious for Maxwell's equations unless you write out the divergence and curl
in terms of partial derivatives. If an equation is not linear, we say it is nonlinear. Let us see
some example nonlinear equations. Burger's equation,

           2      ,
           +  =
                 2

is a nonlinear second-order partial differential equation. It is nonlinear because  and  
are multiplied together. The equation

            = 2 (4)
0.3. CLASSIFICATION OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS                                              19

is a nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equation as there is a second power of the
dependent variable . Another nonlinear ODE is the pendulum equation

                   + sin() = 0,                                                            (5)

which is nonlinear as the dependent variable  appears inside a sin function. Nonlinear

equations are notoriously difficult to solve and their solutions may behave in strange and

unexpected ways. Perhaps you have heard of chaos theory and butterflies in the Amazon

causing hurricanes in the Atlantic, all due to nonlinear equations. So sometimes we study
related linear equations, such as  +  = 0 for the pendulum, instead. The solutions to
 + sin() = 0 and  +  = 0 are different, but they are close for some short time, and

the linear equation is far simpler to solve and analyze.

A linear equation is further called homogeneous if all terms depend on the dependent

variable. That is, if no term is a function of the independent variables alone. Otherwise,

the equation is called nonhomogeneous or inhomogeneous. For example, the exponential

growth equation, the wave equation, or the transport equation above are homogeneous.
The mechanical vibrations equation above is nonhomogeneous as long as  () is not the
zero function. Similarly, if the ambient temperature  is nonzero, Newton's law of cooling

is nonhomogeneous. A homogeneous linear ODE can be put into the form

                  -1                                  
               ()  + -1() -1 + · · · + 1()  + 0() = 0.

Compare with (2) and notice there is no function ().

If the coefficients of a linear equation are actually constant functions, then the equation

is said to have constant coefficients. The coefficients are the functions multiplying the
dependent variable(s) or one of its derivatives, not the function () standing alone. A

constant-coefficient nonhomogeneous ODE is an equation of the form

                  -1       
                 + -1 -1 + · · · + 1  + 0 = (),

where 0, 1, . . . ,  are all constants, but  may depend on the independent variable . The

mechanical vibrations equation is a constant-coefficient nonhomogeneous second-order

ODE. The same nomenclature applies to PDEs, so the transport equation, heat equation

and wave equation are all examples of constant-coefficient linear PDEs. A linear equation

whose coefficients are not constants is sometimes called a variable-coefficient equation.

Finally, an equation (or system) is called autonomous if the equation does not depend on

the independent variable. For autonomous ordinary differential equations, the independent

variable is then thought of as time. An autonomous equation means an equation that

does not change with time. For example, Newton's law of cooling is autonomous, so are
the equations (4) and (5). On the other hand, mechanical vibrations (as long as  () is

First-order equations

1.1 Integrals as solutions

Note: 1 lecture (or less), §1.2 in [EP], covered in §1.2 and §2.1 in [BD]

A first-order ODE is an equation of the form

            
             =  (, ),

or just

             =  (, ).

In general, there is no simple formula or procedure one can follow to find solutions. In the

next few lectures, we will look at cases where solutions are not difficult to obtain. In this
section, we consider the case when  is a function of  alone, that is, the equation is

                             =  ().                                                (1.1)

We can integrate (antidifferentiate) both sides of the equation with respect to :

                            

            ()  =  ()  + ,

that is,            
            () =  ()  + .

This () is actually the general solution. So to solve (1.1), we find some antiderivative of
 () and then we add an arbitrary constant to get the general solution.

Example 1.1.1: Find the general solution of  = 32.
    Elementary calculus tells us that the general solution must be  = 3 + . Let us check

by differentiating:  = 32. We got precisely our equation back.

    Now is a good time to discuss a point about calculus notation and terminology.
Calculus textbooks muddy the waters by talking about the integral as primarily the
22                      CHAPTER 1. FIRST-ORDER EQUATIONS

so-called indefinite integral. The indefinite integral is really the antiderivative (in fact the
whole one-parameter family of antiderivatives). There really exists only one integral and
that is the definite integral. The only reason for the indefinite integral notation is that
we can always write an antiderivative as a definite integral. That is, by the fundamental
theorem of calculus, we can always write  ()  +  as

                                              
                                                        ()  + .

                                                                     0

Hence the terminology to integrate when we may really mean to antidifferentiate. Integration

is just one way to compute the antiderivative (and it is a way that always works, see the

following examples). Integration is defined as the area under the graph--it only happens to

also compute antiderivatives. For the sake of consistency, we will keep using the indefinite

integral notation when we want an antiderivative, and you should always think of the

definite integral as a way to write it.

    Normally, we also have an initial condition such as (0) = 0 for some two numbers 0
and 0 (0 is often 0, but not always). We can then write the solution as a definite integral
in a nice way. Suppose our problem is  =  (), (0) = 0. Then the solution is

                      

                      () =  ()  + 0.                                         (1.2)

                                     0

Let us check! We compute  =  () via the fundamental theorem of calculus, and by Jupiter,

                                                                                                                                  0

 is a solution. Is it the one satisfying the initial condition? Well, (0) =   () +0 = 0.

                                                                                                                                                                             0

It is!
    Do note that the definite integral and the indefinite integral (antidifferentiation) are

completely different beasts. The definite integral always evaluates to a number. Therefore,
(1.2) is a formula we can plug into the calculator or a computer, and it will be happy to
calculate specific values for us. We will easily be able to plot the solution and work with it
just like with any other function. It is not so crucial to always find a closed form for the
antiderivative.

Example 1.1.2: Solve

                       = -2 , (0) = 1.

    By the preceding discussion, the solution must be

                                                   
                                            () = -2  + 1.

                                                                          0

Here is a good way to make fun of your friends taking second-semester calculus. Tell them
to find the closed form solution. Ha ha ha (bad math joke). It is not possible (in closed
form). There is absolutely nothing wrong with writing the solution as a definite integral.
This particular integral is in fact very important in statistics.
1.1. INTEGRALS AS SOLUTIONS                                            23

Using this method, we can also solve equations of the form
                                                 =  ().

We write the equation in Leibniz notation:

                                                    
                                                     =  ().

We use the inverse function theorem from calculus to switch the roles of  and , that is,
we treat  as a function of  and find

                                                     = 1 .
                                                      ()

What we are doing seems like algebra with  and . It is tempting to just do algebra with
 and  as if they were numbers. And in this case it does work. Be careful, however, as

this sort of hand-waving calculation can lead to trouble, especially when more than one
independent variable is involved. At this point, we integrate with respect to ,

                                                  
                                            () = 1  + .

                                                           ()

That is not quite the form we wanted the solution in, so we next try to solve for .
Example 1.1.3: Previously, we guessed  =   (for some  > 0) has the solution  =  .
We could have found the solution by integrating. First we note that  = 0 is a solution.
Henceforth, we assume   0. We write

                                                      = 1 .
                                                      

We integrate in  to obtain

                            () =  = 1 ln || + ,

where  is an arbitrary constant. Now we solve for  (actually for ||).

                            || = - = -.

If we replace - with an arbitrary constant , we can get rid of the absolute value bars
(which we can do as  was arbitrary). In this way, we also incorporate the solution  = 0.
We get the same general solution as we guessed before,  =  .

Example 1.1.4: Find the general solution of  = 2.
    First we note that  = 0 is a solution. We can now assume that   0. Write

                                                       = 21 .
24                                                              CHAPTER 1. FIRST-ORDER EQUATIONS

We integrate to get

                                                    = -1 + .
                                                         

We   solve  for    =    1   So   the  general  solution         is

                      - .

                                 = 1               together with                    = 0.
                                      -

Note the singularities of the solution. If, for example,  = 1, then the solution "blows up"
as we approach  = 1. See Figure 1.1. Generally, it is hard to tell from just looking at the
equation itself how the solution is going to behave. The equation  = 2 is very nice and
defined everywhere, but the solution is only defined on the interval (-, ) or (, ).

Usually when this happens, we only consider the solution on one of these intervals and not

both.  For  example,    if  we   impose    an  initial   condition        (0)   =  1,  then   the  solution  is    =     1

                                                                                                                        1- ,
and we consider this solution only for  on the interval (-, 1), because our initial  (that

is, 0) is in this interval. In the figure, it is the left side of the graph.

    Classical problems leading to differential equations solvable by integration are problems
dealing with velocity, acceleration, and distance. You have surely seen these problems
before in your calculus class.

Example 1.1.5: Suppose a car drives at a speed of /2 meters per second, where  is time
in seconds. How far did the car get in 2 seconds (starting at  = 0)? How far in 10 seconds?

    Let  denote the distance the car traveled. The equation is

                                                    = /2.
1.1. INTEGRALS AS SOLUTIONS                                                     25

We just integrate this equation to get that

                             () = 2/2 + .

We still need to figure out . We know that when  = 0, then  = 0. That is, (0) = 0. So

                      0 = (0) = 20/2 +  = 2 + .

Thus  = -2 and               () = 2/2 - 2.

Now we just plug in to get where the car is at 2 and at 10 seconds. We obtain

(2) = 22/2 - 2  3.44 meters, (10) = 210/2 - 2  294 meters.

Example 1.1.6: Suppose that the car accelerates at 2 m/s2. At time  = 0 the car is at the 1
meter mark and is traveling at 10 m/s. Where is the car at time  = 10?

    Well, this is actually a second-order problem. If  is the distance traveled, then  is the
velocity, and  is the acceleration. The equation with initial conditions is

                    = 2, (0) = 1, (0) = 10.

We can add a new dependent variable  and declare that  = . Then we solve

                       = 2, (0) = 10.

Once we find , we solve  = , (0) = 1 to find . We leave the integration to the reader.

1.2 Slope fields

Note: 1 lecture, §1.3 in [EP], §1.1 in [BD]
    As we said, the general first-order equation we are studying looks like
                                                    =  (, ).

Frequently, we cannot simply solve these kinds of equations explicitly. It would be nice if
we could at least figure out the shape and behavior of the solutions, or find approximate
solutions.

1.2.1 Slope fields

The equation  =  (, ) gives you a slope at each point in the (, )-plane. And this is
the slope a solution () would have at  if its value was . In other words,  (, ) is the
slope of a solution whose graph runs through the point (, ). At a point (, ), we draw
a short line with the slope  (, ). For example, if  (, ) = , then at point (2, 1.5) we
draw a short line of slope  = 2 × 1.5 = 3. If () is a solution and (2) = 1.5, then the

                           Figure 1.2: The slope  =   at (2, 1.5).

    To get an idea of how solutions behave, we draw such lines at lots of points in the plane,
not just the point (2, 1.5). We would ideally want to see the slope at every point, but that is

just not possible. Usually we pick a grid of points fine enough so that it shows the behavior,

but not too fine so that we can still recognize the individual lines. We call this picture

the slope field of the equation. See Figure 1.3 on the following page for the slope field of
the equation  =  . In practice, one does not do this by hand; a computer can do the

drawing.

    Suppose we are given a specific initial condition (0) = 0. A solution, that is, the
graph of the solution, would be a curve that follows the slopes we drew. For a few sample
solutions, see Figure 1.4. It is easy to roughly sketch (or at least imagine) possible solutions
in the slope field, just from looking at the slope field itself. You simply sketch a line that
roughly fits the little line segments and goes through your initial condition.

                                                    (0) = -0.2.

    By looking at the slope field, we get a lot of information about the behavior of solutions
without having to solve the equation. For example, in Figure 1.4 we see what the solutions
do when the initial conditions are (0) > 0, (0) = 0, and (0) < 0. A small change in the
initial condition causes quite different behavior. We see this behavior just from the slope
field and imagining what solutions ought to do.

    We see a different behavior for the equation  = -. The slope field and a few solutions
is in see Figure 1.5 on the next page. If we think of moving from left to right (perhaps  is
time and time is usually increasing), then we see that no matter what (0) is, all solutions
tend to zero as  tends to infinity. Again that behavior is clear from simply looking at the
slope field itself.

1.2.2 Existence and uniqueness

It seems that if we want a solution starting at some point, we could just follow the slope
field. With that in mind, we wish to ask two fundamental questions about the problem

                                          =  (, ), (0) = 0.

   (i) Does a solution exist?

  (ii) Is the solution unique (if it exists)?

Figure 1.5: Slope field of  = - with a graph of a few solutions.

    What do you think is the answer? The answer to both questions seems to be yes, does it
not? Well, it really is yes most of the time. But there are cases when the answer to either
question can be no.

    Since the equations we encounter in applications come from real life situations, it seems
logical that a solution always exists. It also has to be unique if we believe our universe is
deterministic. If the solution does not exist, or if it is not unique, we have probably not
devised the correct model. Hence, it is good to know when things go wrong and why.

Example 1.2.1: Attempt to solve:

                                    = 1 ,     (0) = 0.
                                         

    Integrate to find the general solution  = ln || + . The solution does not exist at  = 0.

See Figure 1.6 on the following page. You may say one can see the division by zero a mile
away, but the equation may have been written as the seemingly harmless   = 1.

Example 1.2.2: Solve:

                                    = 2 ||, (0) = 0.

    See Figure 1.7 on the next page. Note that  = 0 is a solution. But another solution is
the function

                                           () = -2 2 if   0, if  < 0.

    It is hard to tell by staring at the slope field that the solution is not unique. Is there any
hope? Of course there is. We have the following theorem, known as Picard's theorem.

Theorem 1.2.1 (Picard's theorem on existence and uniqueness). If  (, ) is continuous (as a
function of two variables) and    exists and is continuous near some (0, 0), then a solution to

                                         =  (, ), (0) = 0,

exists (at least for  in some small interval) and is unique.

    Note that the problems  = 1/, (0) = 0 and  = 2 ||, (0) = 0 do not satisfy the
hypothesis of the theorem. Even if we can use the theorem, we ought to be careful about
this existence business. It is quite possible that the solution only exists for a short while.

Example 1.2.3: For some constant , solve:

                                               = 2, (0) = .

       We know how to solve this equation. First assume that   0, so  is not equal to zero at

least      for  some    near  0.     So    =  1/2,  so    =  -1/ + ,        so      =    1  If  (0)  =  ,  then     =  1/    so

                                                                                       - .

                                                        = 1 .
                                                             1/ - 

If  = 0, then  = 0 is a solution.
    For instance, when  = 1 the solution "blows up" at  = 1. Hence, the solution does

not exist for all  even if the equation itself is nice everywhere--it only exists in the interval
(-, 1). The equation  = 2 certainly looks nice.

    For most of this course, we will be interested in equations where existence and
uniqueness hold, and in fact hold "globally" unlike for the equation  = 2.

1.3 Separable equations

Note: 1 lecture, §1.4 in [EP], §2.2 in [BD]
                                                                                               

    When a differential equation is of the form  =  (), we integrate:  =  ()  + .
Unfortunately, simply integrating no longer works for the general form of the equation
 =  (, ). Integrating both sides yields the rather unhelpful expression

                                               
                                             =  (, )  + .

Notice the dependence on  in the integral.

1.3.1 Separable equations

We say a differential equation is separable if we can write it as
                                                   =  ()(),

for some functions  () and (). Let us write the equation in the Leibniz notation
                                                 
                                                  =  ()().

We rewrite the equation as         
                                  () =  () .

Both sides look like something we can integrate. We obtain
                                         
                                              () =  ()  + .

If we can find closed form expressions for these two integrals, we can, perhaps, solve for .

Example 1.3.1: Take the equation

                                   = .

Note that  = 0 is a solution. We will remember that fact and assume   0 from now on,
so that we can divide by . Write the equation as   =   or  =  . Then

                                            
                                                   =   + .

We compute the antiderivatives to get
                                                 ln || = 2 + ,
                                                            2

or
                                        || =  2 = 2 +  22   =   22 ,

where  > 0 is some constant. Because  = 0 is also a solution and because of the absolute

value, we can write:                             2

                                 =  2 ,

for any number  (including zero or negative).

    We check:            =  2 = 2   22

                                                    = .

Yay!
    You may be worried that we integrated in two different variables. We seemingly did a

different operation to each side. Perhaps we should be a little bit more careful and work
through this method more rigorously. Consider

                                                 
                                                  =  ()().

We rewrite the equation as follows. Note that  = () is a function of  and so is   !

                                                   1 =   ().
                                                 () 

We integrate both sides with respect to :       ()  + .
                                     1    =
                                          () 

We use the change of variables formula (substitution) on the left-hand side:

                                
                            1  =  ()  + .
                            ()

And we are done.

1.3.2 Implicit solutions

We sometimes get stuck even if we can do the integration. Consider the separable equation
                                                    = 2 + .1

We separate variables,

                        2 + 1  =  + 1  =  .
                                  
1.3. SEPARABLE EQUATIONS                                  35

We integrate to get

                          2  2
                          2 + ln || = 2 + ,

or perhaps the less intimidating expression (where  = 2)

                          2 + 2 ln || = 2 + .

It is not easy to find the solution explicitly--it is hard to solve for . We, therefore, leave the

solution in this form and call it an implicit solution. It is still easy to check that an implicit
solution satisfies the differential equation. In this case, we differentiate with respect to ,
and remember that  is a function of , to get

                     2  + 2 1  =  2 + 2 = 2.

That is usually called "implicit differentiation" in calculus, but it is just the chain rule.
Anyway, now multiply both sides by  and divide by 2(2 + 1) and you will get exactly the
differential equation. We leave this computation to the reader.

    If you have an implicit solution, and you want to compute values for , you might
have to be tricky. You might get multiple solutions  for each , so you have to pick one.
Sometimes you can graph  as a function of , and then turn your paper to see a graph.
Sometimes you have to do more.

    Computers are also good at some of these tricks. More advanced mathematical software
usually has some way of plotting solutions to implicit equations. For example, for  = 0, if
you plot all the points (, ) that are solutions to 2 + 2 ln || = 2, you find the two curves
in Figure 1.8 on the following page. This is not quite a graph of a function. For each  there
are two choices of . To find a function, you have to pick one of these two curves. You
pick the one that satisfies your initial condition if you have one. For instance, the top curve
satisfies the condition (1) = 1. So for each , we really got two solutions. As you can see,
computing values from an implicit solution can be somewhat tricky. But sometimes, an
implicit solution is the best we can do.

    The equation above also has the solution  = 0. So the general solution is

                                 2 + 2 ln || = 2 +  and  = 0.

Sometimes these extra solutions that came up due to division by zero such as  = 0 are
called singular solutions.

    We still solve for the constants using initial conditions in implicit solutions as usual.
For example, consider the initial condition (0) = 1. We can discount the solution  = 0.
In the implicit solution let us plug in  = 0 and  = 1 to get 12 + 2 ln |1| = 02 + , in other
words,  = 1. So the solution for this initial condition is 2 + 2 ln || = 2 + 1, but only the
part of this implicit solution that is positive as that is what our initial condition requires.

1.3.3 More examples of separable equations

Example 1.3.2: Solve 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 - 22, (1) = 0.
    Factor the right-hand side

                                            2 = (1 - 2)(1 + 2).

Separate variables, integrate, and solve for :

                                    1 - 2
                                               ,
                                 =
                       1 + 2               2

                                 = 2 - 1,1

                       1 + 2 

                  arctan() = -1 -  + ,

                                  = tan -1 -  +  .

Solve for the initial condition, 0 = tan(-2 + ) to get  = 2 (or  = 2 + , or  = 2 + 2,
etc.). The particular solution we seek is, therefore,

                        = tan -1 -  + 2 .

Example 1.3.3: Bob made a cup of coffee, and Bob likes to drink coffee only once it reaches
60 degrees Celsius and will not burn him. Initially, right after it was poured in the cup,
Bob measured the temperature and the coffee was 89 degrees Celsius. One minute later,
Bob measured the coffee again and it had 85 degrees. The temperature of the room (the
ambient temperature) is 22 degrees. When should Bob start drinking?
1.3. SEPARABLE EQUATIONS                                                                                    37

    Let  be the temperature of the coffee in degrees Celsius, let  be the ambient (room)
temperature, also in degrees Celsius, and let  denote the time in minutes, with  = 0
denoting the time when Bob made the coffee. Newton's law of cooling states that the rate
at which the temperature of the coffee is changing is proportional to the difference between
the ambient temperature and the temperature of the coffee. That is,

                                                  = ( - ),
                                                 

for some positive constant . For our setup  = 22, (0) = 89, (1) = 85. Let  and 
denote arbitrary constants, and notice that  -  > 0 since the coffee is clearly warmer than
the room. We separate variables and integrate.

                                               1  = -,
                                             -  
                                            ln( - ) = - + ,

                                                  -  = -,
                                                       =  + -.

That is,  = 22 + -. We plug in the first condition: 89 = (0) = 22 + , and hence
 = 67. So  = 22 + 67-. The second condition says 85 = (1) = 22 + 67-. Solving

for  ,  we  get    =  - ln  85-22    0.0616.  We  solve  for  the  time    that  gives  a  temperature  of  60
                              67

degrees. Namely, we solve

                                     60 = 22 + 67-0.0616 

                      ln 60-22 67

to get  = - 0.0616  9.21 minutes. So Bob can begin to drink the coffee at just over 9
minutes from the time Bob made it. That is probably about the amount of time it took us

to calculate how long it would take. See Figure 1.9 on the next page.

Example 1.3.4: Find the general solution to  = 3 -2 (including any singular solutions).
    First, note that  = 0 is a solution (a singular solution). Next, assume   0 and separate:

                                     2 -3  = ,

                                         3 =  + 2 ,
                                         2
                                          = 2 3 = 2 6 .

                                                 /2 +   + 2

The general solution is

                                      = 2 6+ 2 and  = 0.

1.4 Linear equations and the integrating factor

Note: 1 lecture, §1.5 in [EP], §2.1 in [BD]

    One of the most important types of equations we will learn to solve are the so-called

linear equations. In fact, the majority of the course is about linear equations. In this section

we focus on the first-order linear equation. A first-order equation is linear if we can put it

into the form:

                             + () =  ().                         (1.3)

The word "linear" means linear in  and ; no higher powers or functions of  or  appear.
The dependence on  can be more complicated.

    Solutions of linear equations have nice properties. For example, the solution exists
wherever () and  () are continuous, and it has essentially the same regularity (read:

it is just as nice). Most importantly for us right now, there is a method for solving linear

first-order equations.
    The trick is to rewrite the left-hand side of (1.3) as a derivative of a product of  with

another function. To this end, we wish to find a function () such that

                  () + ()() =  () .
                                              

This is the left-hand side of (1.3) multiplied by (). If we multiply (1.3) by (), we obtain
                                              () = ()  ().
                                             

We can now integrate both sides, which we can do as the right-hand side does not depend
on  and the left-hand side is written as a derivative of a function. After the integration,
we solve for  by dividing by (). The function () is called the integrating factor and the

method is called the integrating factor method.
    We are looking for a function (), such that if we differentiate it, we get the same

function back multiplied by (). That seems like a job for the exponential function! Let

                                                                             

                                                 () =  () ,

        
where ()  is any antiderivative of (). We compute:

                   + () =  (),
                                             
     ()   +  ()  () =  ()   (),

                  ()   =  ()   (),
                
                                             
                          
                   ()   =  ()   ()  + ,

                                                 
                             = - ()               ()   ()  +  .
1.4. LINEAR EQUATIONS AND THE INTEGRATING FACTOR                                                   41

    Of course, to get a closed form formula for , we need to be able to find a closed form
formula for the integrals appearing above.

Example 1.4.1: Solve

                               + 2  = -2 , (0) = -1.

First  note   that  ()  =  2  and    ()  =   -2 .  The  integrating  factor  is  ()  =     ()   =  2.

                                                                                        

We multiply both sides of the equation by () to get

                                   2  + 22  = 2 -2 ,
                                          2  = .
                                         

We integrate

                                     2  =  + ,
                                         = -2 + -2.

Next, we solve for the initial condition -1 = (0) = 1 + , so  = -2. The solution is

                                                = -2 - 2-2.

                                                                                                                                     

    Note that we do not care which antiderivative we take when computing  (). You
can always add a constant of integration, but those constants will not matter in the end.

Exercise 1.4.1: Try it! Add a constant of integration to the integral in the integrating factor and
show that the solution you get in the end is the same as what we got above.

    Advice: Do not try to remember the formula for  itself; that is way too hard. It is easier
to remember the process and repeat it.

    Since we cannot always evaluate the integrals in closed form, it is useful to know how
to write the solution in definite integral form. A definite integral is something that you can
plug into a computer or a calculator. Suppose we are given

                               + () =  (), (0) = 0.

Look at the solution and write the integrals as definite integrals.

                                              
                        () =  0 -  ()               0 ()   ()  + 0 .
                                                                                                (1.4)
                                            0

You should be careful to properly use dummy variables here. If you now plug such a
formula into a computer or a calculator, it will be happy to give you numerical answers.

Exercise 1.4.2: Check that (0) = 0 in formula (1.4).
42                                      CHAPTER 1. FIRST-ORDER EQUATIONS

Exercise 1.4.3: Write the solution of the following problem as a definite integral, but try to simplify
as far as you can. You will not be able to find the solution in closed form.

                                         +  = 2- , (0) = 10.

Remark 1.4.1: Before we move on, we should note some interesting properties of linear
equations. First, for the linear initial value problem  + () =  (), (0) = 0, there

is an explicit formula (1.4) for the solution. Second, it follows from the formula (1.4) that
if () and  () are continuous on some interval (, ), then the solution () exists and
is differentiable on (, ). Compare with the simple nonlinear example we have seen
previously,  = 2, and compare to Theorem 1.2.1.

Example 1.4.2: We get to a common simple application of linear equations. Real-life

applications of this type of problem include computing the concentration of chemicals in

bodies of water (rivers and lakes).

    A 100 liter tank contains 10 kilograms of salt dissolved in 60          5 L/min, 0.1 kg/L

liters of water. Solution of water and salt (brine) with concentration

of 0.1 kilograms per liter is flowing in at the rate of 5 liters a minute.

The solution in the tank is well stirred and flows out at a rate of 3

liters a minute. How much salt is in the tank when the tank is full?

    To solve this problem, we need to find the differential equation           60 L
for this setup. Let  denote the kilograms of salt in the tank, let          10 kg salt
 denote the time in minutes. For a small change  in time, the
change in  (denoted ) is approximately                                                  3 L/min

      (rate in × concentration in) - (rate out × concentration out).

Dividing through by  and taking the limit   0, we see that

     = (rate in × concentration in) - (rate out × concentration out).
    

In our example,

                 rate in = 5,

    concentration in = 0.1,

                 rate out = 3,

                 volume = initial volume + (rate in - rate out) = 60 + (5 - 3),

    concentration out =              =  .

                              volume 60 + (5 - 3)

Our differential equation is

                               = (5 × 0.1) - 3  .
                                        60 + 2
1.4. LINEAR EQUATIONS AND THE INTEGRATING FACTOR                                     43

In the form (1.3), it is   + 3 60 + 2  = 0.5.

Let us solve. The integrating factor is

                                                             = (60 + 2)3/2.
() = exp 3 60 + 2  = exp 32 ln(60 + 2)

We multiply both sides of the equation by () to get

(60 + 2)3/2  + (60 + 2)3/2 3 60 + 2  = 0.5(60 + 2)3/2,
                           (60 + 2)3/2 = 0.5(60 + 2)3/2,
                                         

                          (60 + 2)3/2 = 0.5(60 + 2)3/2 + ,

                                                          (60 + 2)3  + (60 + 2)-3/2 /2 ,
                           = (60 + 2)-3/2                       2

                           = (60 + 2)-3/2 1 (60 + 2)5/2 + (60 + 2)-3/2,
                                               10

                           = 60 + 2 + (60 + 2)-3/2.
                                  10

To find , note that at  = 0, we have                  0   5      10          15  20

 = 10. That is,

10 = (0) = 60 + (60)-3/2 = 6 + (60)-3/2, 11.5 11.5
                10

or
              = 4(603/2)  1859.03. 11.0 11.0

    We know 5 liters per minute are flowing     10.5                                 10.5

in and 3 liters per minute are flowing out, so  10.0                                 10.0
                                                       0
the volume is increasing by 2 liters a minute.            5      10          15  20
So the tank is full when 60 + 2 = 100, or
when  = 20. We are interested in the value      Figure 1.10: Graph of the solution  kilograms of
of  when the tank is full, that is, we want     salt in the tank at time .
to compute (20):

                          (20) = 60 + 40 + (60 + 40)-3/2
                                        10

                                  10 + 1859.03(100)-3/2  11.86.

There are 11.86 kg of salt in the tank when it is full. See Figure 1.10 for the graph of  over .
    The concentration when the tank is full is approximately 11.86/100 = 0.1186 kg/liter, and

we started with 1/6 or approximately 0.1667 kg/liter.

1.5 Substitution

Note: 1 lecture, can safely be skipped, §1.6 in [EP], not in [BD]
    Just as when solving integrals, one method to try is to change variables to end up with

a simpler equation to solve.

1.5.1 Substitution

The equation

                                = ( -  + 1)2

is neither separable nor linear. What can we do? How about trying to change variables, so
that in the new variables the equation is simpler. We use another variable , which we
treat as a function of . We try

                                                   =  -  + 1.

We need to figure out  in terms of ,  and . We differentiate (in ) to obtain  = 1 - .
So  = 1 - . We plug this into the equation to get

                               1 -  = 2.

In other words,  = 1 - 2. Such an equation we know how to solve by separating variables:

                               1 - 2 1  = .

So  12 ln  + 1  - 1 =  + , or   + 1  - 1 = 2+2 , or  + 1  - 1 = 2 ,

for some constant . Note that  = 1 and  = -1 are also solutions.
    Now we need to "unsubstitute" to obtain

                               =  -  + 2 2 ,
                                 -

and also the two solutions  -  + 1 = 1 or  = , and  -  + 1 = -1 or  =  + 2. We solve

the first equation for :   -  + 2 = ( - )2,

                           -  + 2 = 2 - 2,

                          - + 2 = 2 -  - 2,

                           (-1 + 2) = 2 -  - 2,

                               =  2 -  - 2    .

                                   - 1    2

Note that  = 0 gives  =  + 2, but no value of  gives the solution  = .
1.5. SUBSTITUTION                                                                                       47

    Substitution in differential equations is applied in much the same way that it is applied
in calculus. You guess. Several different substitutions might work. There are some general
patterns to look for. We summarize a few of these in a table.

                                When you see        Try substituting

                                                     = 2
                                2                    = 3
                                (cos )               = sin 
                                (sin )               = cos 
                                                     = 

    Usually, you try to substitute in the "most complicated" part of the equation, with the
hopes of simplifying it. The table above is just a rule of thumb. You might have to modify
your guesses. If a substitution does not work (it does not make the equation any simpler),
try a different one.

1.5.2 Bernoulli equations

There are some forms of equations where there is a general rule for substitution that always
works. One such example is the so-called Bernoulli equation:

                                         + () = ().

This equation looks a lot like a linear equation except for the . If  = 0 or  = 1, then the
equation is linear and we can solve it. Otherwise, the substitution  = 1- transforms the
Bernoulli equation into a linear equation. Note that  need not be an integer.

Example 1.5.1: Solve

                                  + ( + 1) +  5 = 0, (1) = 1.

Divide     the  equation  by    and  rearrange  to  see  it  is  a  Bernoulli  equation,    +  +1    =  -5,
                                                                                                
                   +1
that  is,  ()   =      and  ()  =  -1.  We  substitute

                                 = 1-5 = -4,  = -4-5 .

In other words, (-1/4) 5 = . So

                                               + ( + 1) +  5 = 0,
                                        - 5  + ( + 1) +  5 = 0,

                                           4

     There are several things called Bernoulli equations; this is just one of them. The Bernoullis were
a prominent Swiss family of mathematicians. These particular equations are named for Jacob Bernoulli
(1654-1705).
48                                               CHAPTER 1. FIRST-ORDER EQUATIONS

                                       -  + -4( + 1) +  = 0,
                                        4-  + ( + 1) +  = 0,

                                          4

and finally                             - 4( + 1)   = 4.

The equation is now linear. We can use the integrating factor method. In particular, we
use formula (1.4). We assume that  > 0 so || = . This assumption is OK, as our initial
condition is at  = 1 > 0. Let us compute the integrating factor. Here () from formula
(1.4) is  -4(+1) .

      1 ()    = exp -4( + 1)                  = -4-4 ln()+4 = -4+4-4 = -4+4 ,
                                                                                       4
                         1
             
    - 1 ()  = 4+4 ln()-4 = 4-44.

We now plug in to (1.4)

                                                
                         () = - 1 ()               1 () 4  + 1

                                         - 4-4 4  4+4 1   + 1 .
                                       =      4
                                                      4
                                           1

The integral in this expression is not possible to find in closed form. As we said before, it is

perfectly fine to have a definite integral in our solution. Now "unsubstitute"

                         -4 = 4-44   4 -4+4  + 1 ,
                                                1 4

                            =               - +1            .

                                           -4+4          1/4
                                        4 1 4  + 1

1.5.3 Homogeneous equations

Another type of equations we can solve by substitution are the so-called homogeneous
equations. Suppose that we can write the differential equation as

                                                    =   .
                                                              

Here we try the substitutions          and therefore      =  + .

We note that the equation is transformed into

 +  = () or  = () -  or                                             = 1 .
                                                                   () -  

Hence an implicit solution is
                                       
                                             1 () -   = ln || + .

Clearly this solution does not work when  = 0 (we would, after all, divide by zero in /).
So we will either assume  > 0 or  < 0 depending on the initial condition.

Example 1.5.2: Solve

                      2 = 2 +  , (1) = 1.

    We put the equation into the form  = (/)2 + /, that is, () = 2 + . As the initial
condition is for a positive  value, we will assume  > 0. We substitute  = / to get the

separable equation

                       = 2 +  -  = 2,

which has a solution  
                          21  = ln || + ,

                      -1 = ln  + ,

                       = -1 .
                           ln  + 

We unsubstitute        =  -1 ln  +  , or  = - ln  +  .

We want (1) = 1, so

                      1 = (1) = -1 ln 1 +  = -1 .

Thus  = -1 and the solution we are looking for is

                       = - .
                           ln  - 1

1.6 Autonomous equations

Note: 1 lecture, §2.2 in [EP], §2.5 in [BD]

     Consider problems of the form            =  (),
                                             

where the derivative of solutions depends only on  (the dependent variable). Such
equations are called autonomous equations. If we think of  as time, the naming comes from

the fact that the equation is independent of time.

     We return to the cooling coffee problem (Example 1.3.3). Newton's law of cooling says

                                     = ( - ),
                                    

where  is the temperature,  is time,  is some positive constant, and  is the ambient
temperature. See Figure 1.11 for an example with  = 0.3 and  = 5.

    Note the solution  =  (in the figure  = 5). We call these constant solutions the
equilibrium solutions. The points on the -axis where  () = 0 are called critical points or
equilibria. The point  =  is a critical point. In fact, each critical point corresponds to an
equilibrium solution. Note also, by looking at the graph, that the solution  =  is "stable"
in that small perturbations in  do not lead to substantially different solutions as  grows.
If we change the initial condition a little bit, then as   , we still get ()  . We call
such a critical point stable. In this simple example, all solutions in fact go to  as   . If

a critical point is not stable, we say it is unstable.

 = 0.3 (5 - ).                                         = 0.1  (5 - ).

     Consider now the logistic equation
                                                  = ( - ),
                                                 
52              CHAPTER 1. FIRST-ORDER EQUATIONS

for some positive  and . This equation is commonly used to model population if we
know the limiting population , that is, the maximum sustainable population. The logistic
equation leads to less catastrophic predictions on world population than  = . In the

real world, there is no such thing as negative population, but we will still consider negative
 for the purposes of the math.

    See Figure 1.12 on the preceding page for an example,  = 0.1(5 - ). There are two
critical points,  = 0 and  = 5. The critical point at  = 5 is stable, while the critical point
at  = 0 is unstable. It is not necessary to find the exact solutions to understand their long

term behavior, that is, behavior as time goes to infinity. From the slope field above of
 = 0.1(5 - ), we see that

      5             if (0) > 0,
                    if (0) = 0,
    lim () = 0      if (0) < 0.
      
      DNE or -

Here DNE means "does not exist." From just looking at the slope field, we cannot quite
decide what happens if (0) < 0. It could be that the solution does not exist for  all the
way to . Think of the equation  = 2; we have seen that solutions only exist for some

finite period of time. Same can happen here. In our example equation above it turns out

that the solution does not exist for all time, but to see that we would have to solve the

equation. In any case, the solution does go to -, but it may get there rather quickly.

    If we are interested only in the long term behavior of the solution, we would be doing

unnecessary work if we solved the equation exactly. We could draw the slope field, but it

is easier to just look at the phase diagram or phase portrait, which is a simple way to visualize
the behavior of autonomous equations. In this case there is one dependent variable, the .
We draw the -axis, we mark all the critical points, and then we draw arrows in between.
Since  is the dependent variable, we draw the axis vertically, as it appears in the slope
field diagrams above. If  () > 0, we draw an up arrow. If  () < 0, we draw a down
arrow. To figure this out, we could just plug in some  between the critical points,  ()
will have the same sign at all  between two critical points as long  () is continuous. For
example,  (6) = -0.6 < 0, so  () < 0 for  > 5, and the arrow above  = 5 is a down arrow.
Next,  (1) = 0.4 > 0, so  () > 0 whenever 0 <  < 5, and the arrow points up. Finally,
 (-1) = -0.6 < 0, so  () < 0 when  < 0, and the arrow points down.

                =5
                =0
1.6. AUTONOMOUS EQUATIONS                                             53

    Armed with the phase diagram, it is easy to sketch the solutions approximately: As
time  moves from left to right, the graph of a solution goes up if the arrow is up, and it
goes down if the arrow is down.

Exercise 1.6.1: Try sketching a few solutions simply from looking at the phase diagram. Check with
the preceding graphs if you are getting the same type of curves.

    Once we draw the phase diagram, we classify critical points as stable or unstable.
Since any mathematical model we cook up will only be an approximation to the real world,
unstable points are generally bad news.

                           unstable                stable

    We remark that you can figure out the arrows by plotting the graph  =  (). However,
in that case note that  is then the dependent variable and will be on the horizontal axis.

Let us think about the logistic equation with harvesting. Suppose an alien race really

likes to eat humans. They keep a planet with humans and harvest the humans at a rate
of  million humans per year. Suppose  is the number of humans in millions on the
planet and  is time in years. Let  be the limiting population when no harvesting is done.
The number  > 0 is a constant depending on how fast humans multiply. Our equation

becomes             = ( - ) - .
                   

We expand the right-hand side and set it to zero.

         ( - ) -  = -2 +  -  = 0.

Solving for the critical points, let us call them  and , we get

                +  ()2 - 4                   -     ()2 - 4 
         =                         ,  =                            .

                    2                               2

Exercise 1.6.2: Sketch a phase diagram for different possibilities. Note that these possibilities are
 > , or  = , or  and  both complex (i.e. no real solutions). Hint: Fix some simple  and 
and then vary .

    For example, let  = 8 and  = 0.1. When  = 1, then  and  are distinct and positive.

See Figure 1.13 on the next page for the slope field. As long as the population starts above
, which is approximately 1.55 million, then the population will not die out, it will tend
towards   6.45 million. If ever a catastrophe happens and the population drops below
, humans will die out, and the fast food restaurant serving them will go out of business.

Unstable points with one of the arrows pointing towards the critical point are sometimes called semistable.

    When  = 1.6, then  =  = 4. There is only one critical point and it is unstable.
When the population starts above 4 million, it will tend towards 4 million. However, if it
ever drops below 4 million, perhaps a worse than normal hurricane season one year, then
humans will die out on the planet. This scenario is not one that we (as the human fast food
proprietor) want to be in. A small perturbation of the equilibrium state and we are out of
business. There is no room for error. See Figure 1.14.

    Finally, if we are harvesting at 2 million humans per year, there are no critical points.
The population will always plummet towards zero, no matter how well stocked the planet
starts. See Figure 1.15.

Note: 1 lecture, can safely be skipped, §2.4 in [EP], §8.1 in [BD]
    Unless  (, ) is of a special form, it is generally very hard if not impossible to get a

nice formula for the solution of the problem

                                         =  (, ), (0) = 0.

    If the equation can be solved in closed form, we should do that. But what if we have

an equation that cannot be solved in closed form? What if we want to find the value
of the solution at some particular ? Or perhaps we want to produce a graph of the

solution to inspect the behavior. In this section we will learn about the basics of numerical

approximation of solutions.
    The simplest method for approximating a solution is Euler's method. It works as follows:

Take 0 and 0 and compute the slope  =  (0, 0). The slope is the change in  per unit
change in . Follow the line for an interval of length  on the -axis. We call  the step
size. Hence if  = 0 at 0, then we say that 1, the approximate value of  at 1 = 0 + ,
is 1 = 0 +  . Rinse, repeat! Let  =  (1, 1), and then compute 2 = 1 +  and
2 = 1 +  . Now compute 3 and 3 using 2 and 2, etc. Consider the equation  = 2/3,
(0) = 1, and  = 1. Then 0 = 0 and 0 = 1. We compute

1 = 0 +  = 0 + 1 = 1, 1 = 0 +   (0, 0) = 1 + 1 · 1/3 = 4/3  1.333,

2 = 1 +  = 1 + 1 = 2,  2 = 1 +   (1, 1) = 4/3 + 1 ·  (4/3)2  = 52/27  1.926.

                                                     3

We draw an approximate graph of the solution by connecting the points (0, 0), (1, 1),
(2, 2),. . . . See Figure 1.16 on the following page for the first two steps of the method.

    We can continue along, for any  = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . ., we compute

+1 =  + , +1 =  +   ( , ).

The line segments we get are an approximate graph of the solution. In particular,  is the
approximation of (). Generally it is not exactly the solution. See Figure 1.17 on the next

page for the plot of the real solution and the approximation.
    We continue with the example  = 2/3, (0) = 1. We have approximated (2) with

Euler's method with step size 1. We conclude that (2) is approximately 2, that is,
(2)  1.926. The real answer is 3. We are off by roughly 1.074. The difference between the

actual solution and the approximate solution is called the error. We usually talk about the

size of the error and we do not care much about its sign.

Error = Actual  - Approximate  .

We usually do not know the error exactly. If we knew the error exactly, we would know
the actual solution . . . so what is the point of doing the approximation?

     Named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Paul Euler (1707-1783). The correct pronunciation of
the name sounds more like "oiler."

Exercise 1.7.1: Solve the problem  = 2/3, (0) = 1 exactly and show that (2) = 3.

    Let us now halve the step size to  = 0.5 to, hopefully, improve the approximation. With
half the step size, we do twice as many steps. Here, to find (2), we do 4 steps with  = 0.5
as then 2 = 4. Computing 4, we find (2)  2.209. An error of about 0.791. Table 1.1 on
the facing page gives the values computed, for a few more halvings.

    Note that except for the first few times, each time we halve the , the error approximately
halves. Halving of the error is a general feature of Euler's method as it is a first-order method.

A simple improvement of the Euler method, see the exercises, produces a second-order

method. A second-order method reduces the error to approximately one quarter every time
we halve the step size. The order being "second" means the squaring in 1/4 = 1/2×1/2 = (1/2)2.

Table 1.1: Euler's method approximation of (2) where of  = 2/3, (0) = 1.

    To get the error to be less than 0.1, we did 64 steps. To get it below 0.01, we would have
to halve another three or four times, doing 512 or 1024 steps. The improved Euler method
from the exercises should quarter the error every time we halve the step size, so we would
have to do (approximately) half as many "halvings" to get the same error. This reduction
can be a big deal. With 10 halvings (starting at  = 1) we have 1024 steps, whereas with 5
halvings we only have to do 32 steps, assuming that the error was comparable to start with.
A computer may not care about this difference for a problem this simple, but suppose each
step would take a second to compute (the function may be substantially more difficult to
compute than 2/3). Then the difference is 32 seconds versus about 17 minutes. We are not
being altogether fair; a second-order method would probably double the time to do each
step. Even so, it is 1 minute versus 17 minutes. Next, suppose that we have to repeat such
a calculation for different parameters a thousand times. You get the idea.

    In practice, we do not know how large the error is! How do we know what is the right
step size? One possibility is that we keep halving the step size, and if we are lucky, we
can estimate the error from a few of these calculations and the assumption that the error
halves each time (if we are using standard Euler).

Exercise 1.7.2: In the table above, suppose you do not know the error. Take the approximate values
of the function in the last two lines, assume that the error halves. Can you estimate the error in the
last line from this information? Does it (approximately) agree with the table? Now do it for the first
two rows. Does this agree with the table? Feel free to assume that the real value of (2) is bigger
than any of the approximate values, but you are not allowed to know the real value.

    Let us talk a little bit more about the example  = 2/3, (0) = 1. Suppose that instead
of (2), we wish to find (3). Table 1.2 on the next page lists the results of this effort for
successive halvings of . What is going on here? Well, you should solve the equation
exactly and you will notice that the solution does not exist at  = 3. In fact, the solution
goes to infinity when you approach  = 3.

    Another case where things go bad is if the solution oscillates wildly near some point.
The solution may exist at all points, but even a much better numerical method than
Euler would need an insanely small step size to approximate the solution with reasonable
precision. And computers might not be able to easily handle such a small step size.

    In real applications, we would not use a simple method such as Euler's. The simplest
method one would probably use in a real application is the standard Runge-Kutta method
(see exercises). That is a fourth-order method, meaning that if we halve the step size, the
error gets multiplied by 1/16 (it is fourth-order as 1/16 = 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2).

    Choosing the right method to use and the right step size can be very tricky. There are
several competing factors to consider.

    · Computational time: Each step takes computer time. Even if the function  is simple
       to compute, we do it many times over. Large step size (fewer steps) means faster
       computation, but perhaps not the right precision.

    · Roundoff errors: Computers only compute with a certain number of significant digits.
       Errors introduced by rounding numbers during computations become noticeable
       when the step size becomes too small relative to the quantities we are working with.
       So reducing step size too much may make errors worse. There is a certain optimum
       step size where the precision increases as we approach it, but then starts getting
       worse as we make our step size smaller still. The trouble is that this optimum may be
       hard to find.

    · Stability: Certain equations may be numerically unstable. What may happen is that
       the numbers never seem to stabilize no matter how many times we halve the step
       size. We may need a ridiculously small step size, which may not be practical due to
       roundoff errors or computational time considerations. Such problems are sometimes
       called stiff . In the worst case, the numerical computations might be giving us bogus
1.7. NUMERICAL METHODS: EULER'S METHOD               61

       numbers that look like a correct answer. Just because the numbers seem to have
       stabilized after successive halving, does not mean that we must have the right answer.

    We have seen just the beginnings of the challenges that appear in real applications.
Numerical approximation of solutions to differential equations is an active research area
for engineers and mathematicians. For example, the general purpose method used for the
ODE solver in Matlab and Octave (as of this writing) is a method that appeared in the
literature only in the 1980s.

1.7.1 Exercises

Exercise 1.7.3: Consider  = (2 - )2, (0) = 2. Use Euler's method with step size  = 0.5 to
approximate (1).
Exercise 1.7.4: Consider  =  - , (0) = 1.

                                

a) Use Euler's method with step sizes  = 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 to approximate (1).

b) Solve the equation exactly.
c) Describe what happens to the errors for each  you used. That is, find the factor by which the

   error changed each time you halved the step size.

Exercise 1.7.5: Approximate the value of  by looking at the initial value problem  =  with
(0) = 1 and approximating (1) using Euler's method with a step size of 0.2.

Exercise 1.7.6: Example of numerical instability: Take  = -5, (0) = 1. We know that the
solution should decay to zero as  grows. Using Euler's method, start with  = 1 and compute
1, 2, 3, 4 to try to approximate (4). What happened? Now halve the step size. Keep halving
the step size and approximating (4) until the numbers you are getting start to stabilize (that is,

until they start going towards zero). Note: You might want to use a calculator.

    The simplest method used in practice is the Runge-Kutta method. Consider   =  (, ),
(0) = 0, and a step size . Everything is the same as in Euler's method, except the
computation of +1 and +1. That is, in each step we compute slopes 1, 2, 3, and 4,
and then we compute the next +1 and +1:

1 =  (, ),              +1 =  + ,
2 =   + /2,  + 1(/2) ,  +1 =  + 1 + 22 + 23 + 4 ,

3 =   + /2,  + 2(/2) ,                            6

   a) Approximate (4) using Euler's method with step sizes 4, 2, and 1.
   b) Guess an exact solution based on part a) and compute the errors.

    There is a simple way to improve Euler's method to make it a second-order method
by doing just one extra step. Consider   =  (, ), (0) = 0, and a step size . What
we do is to pretend we compute the next step as in Euler, that is, we start with ( , ),

we compute a slope 1 =  ( , ), and then look at the point ( + ,  + 1 ). Instead of
letting our new point be ( + ,  + 1 ), we compute the slope at that point, call it 2,
and then take the average of 1 and 2, hoping that the average is going to be closer to
the actual slope on the interval from  to  + . And we are correct, if we halve the step,
the error should get multiplied by (1/2)2 = 1/4. To summarize, the setup is the same as for

regular Euler, except the computation of +1 and +1. At each step, we compute the new
slopes 1 and 2 and then the next +1 and +1:

                    1 =  (, ),               +1 =  + ,
                    2 =  ( + ,  + 1),        +1 =  + 1 + 2 .

                                                               2

1.8 Exact equations

Note: 1-2 lectures, can safely be skipped, §1.6 in [EP], §2.6 in [BD]

    A type of equation that comes up quite often in physics and engineering is an exact
equation. Suppose (, ) is a function of two variables, which we call the potential function.
The naming should suggest potential energy, or electric potential. Exact equations and
potential functions appear when there is a conservation law at play, such as conservation
of energy. Let us make up a simple example. Consider

                                               (, ) = 2 + 2.

    We are interested in the lines of constant
potential; curves given by (, ) = , for 10 -10 -5 0 5 10 10

some constant . In our example, the curves

2 + 2 =  are circles. See Figure 1.18.         5                                 5

  We take the total derivative of :

        =   +  . 0 0
                         

For convenience, we will use the notation -5                                     -5

  =    and    =      In  our  example,
     
                  .

        = 2  + 2 .                             -10                               -10

                                                    -10  -5            0  5  10

If we apply the total derivative to the equa-  Figure 1.18: Solutions to (, ) = 2 + 2 = 
tion (, ) = , we find the differential         for various .
equation  = 0. This differential equation

has the form                                                         
                       +   = 0, or  +   = 0.

An equation of this form is called exact if it was obtained as  = 0 for some potential
function . In our simple example, we obtain the equation

                                                                       
                     2  + 2  = 0, or 2 + 2  = 0.

Since we obtained this equation by differentiating 2 + 2 = , the equation is exact. We
often wish to solve for  in terms of . In our example,

                                                         
                                                  = ±  - 2.

    In terms of multivariable calculus, at each point (, ) in the plane, ì = (, ) is a
vector, that is, a direction and a magnitude. As  and  are functions of (, ), we have a

     Accordingly, these curves are sometimes called equipotential curves.

vector field. A vector field ì that comes from an exact equation is a so-called conservative
vector field, that is, a vector field that comes with a potential function (, ), such that

                         ì =  ,  .
                                 

Let  be a path in the plane starting at (1, 1) and ending at (2, 2). If we think of ì as

force, then the work required to move along  is the path integral
                       

                       ì(ì) · ì =   +   = (2, 2) - (1, 1).
                       

In other words, the work done depends only on the endpoints--where we start and where
we end. For example, suppose  is gravitational potential (physicists use the convention
that - is the potential, but idea is the same). The derivative of  given by ì is the

gravitational force. What we are saying is that the work required to move a heavy box

from the ground floor to the roof only depends on the change in potential energy. The

work done is the same no matter what path we took; if we took the stairs or the elevator.

Although if we took the elevator, the elevator did the work for us. Movement along the
curves (, ) =  requires no work done, such as the heavy box sliding along without

accelerating or braking on a perfectly flat roof on a cart with incredibly well-oiled wheels.

    An exact equation is a conservative vector field, and the implicit solution of this equation

is the potential function.

1.8.1 Solving exact equations

Now you, the reader, should ask: Where did we solve a differential equation? Well, in
applications we generally know  and , but we do not know . That is, we may have
just started with 2 + 2   = 0, or perhaps even

                                      
                                +   = 0.

It is up to us to find some potential  that works. Many different  will work; adding
a constant to  does not change the equation. Once we have a potential function , the
equation  , () =  gives an implicit solution of the ODE.

Example 1.8.1: Let us find the general solution to 2 + 2   = 0. Forget we know .

    If we know that this is an exact equation, we start looking for a potential function .

We have  = 2 and  = 2. If  exists, it must be such that (, ) = 2. Integrate in

the  variable to find

                         (, ) = 2 + (),                                           (1.5)

for some function (). The function  is the "constant of integration," though it is only
constant as far as  is concerned, and may still depend on . Now differentiate (1.5) in 
and set it equal to , which is what  is supposed to be:

                         2 = (, ) = ().
1.8. EXACT EQUATIONS                                                                                  65

Integrating, we find () = 2. We could add a constant of integration if we wanted to,
but there is no need. We found (, ) = 2 + 2. Next for a constant , we solve

                                                  , () = 

                                                               
for  in terms of . In this case, we obtain  = ±  - 2 as we did before.

Exercise 1.8.1: Why did we not need to add a constant of integration when integrating () = 2?
Add a constant of integration, say 3, and see what  you get. What is the difference from what we
got above, and why does it not matter?

    The procedure, once we know that the equation is exact, is:

   (i) Integrate  =  in  resulting in (, ) = something + ().

  (ii) Differentiate this  in  and set that equal to . Then find () by integration.

The procedure can also be done by first integrating in  and then differentiating in . Pretty
easy huh? Let's try this again.
Example 1.8.2: Consider now 2 +  +     = 0.

    OK, so  = 2 +  and  = . We try to proceed as before. Suppose  exists. Then
(, ) = 2 + . We integrate:

                                      (, ) = 2 +  + ()

for some function (). Differentiate in  and set equal to :

                                =  = (, ) =  + ().

But there is no way to satisfy this requirement! The function  cannot be written as 
plus a function of . The equation is not exact; no potential function  exists.

    Is there an easier way to check for exactness, other than failing in trying to find ? Yes
there is. Suppose  =  and  = . As long as the second derivatives are continuous,

                                =  = = 2 2  .
                                  

If   , the equation is not exact. For example, in Example 1.8.2, where  = 2 + 
and  =  , the equation is not exact. Indeed,  = 1 and  =  are not equal.

    What is interesting is that this idea works in reverse too. If  = , then a potential
exists, at least near an initial point. This result is called the Poincaré Lemma.

Theorem 1.8.1 (Poincaré Lemma). If  and  are continuously differentiable functions of (, ),
                                                                                                  
and    =      then  near  any  point  there  is  a  function  (,  )  such  that    =    and    =
           ,                                                                                       .

Named for the French polymath Jules Henri Poincaré (1854-1912).
66                                            CHAPTER 1. FIRST-ORDER EQUATIONS

Example 1.8.3: Solve      =  -2 -  ,          (0) = 1.
Write the equation as       - 1

                                                 
                          (2 + ) + ( - 1)  = 0,

so  = 2 + ,  =  - 1, and

                           = 1 = .

Poincaré Lemma applies, so let us look for . Integrating  in , we find

                          (, ) = 2 +  + ().

Differentiating in  and setting to , we find

                           - 1 =  + ().

So () = -1, and () = - will work. We obtain (, ) = 2 +   - , so the implicit
solution is 2 +   -  = . First we find . As (0) = 1, we have (0, 1) = . Therefore,
02 + 0 × 1 - 1 = , so  = -1. Now we solve 2 +   -  = -1 for  to get

                           = -2 - 1.
                                 -1

Example 1.8.4: Solve

                       -  
                       2 + 2  + 2 + 2  = 0,   (1) = 2.

We leave to the reader to check that  = , so the Poincaré Lemma applies.
    This vector field (, ) is not conservative (the equation is not exact) if considered as a

vector field of the entire plane minus the origin. The problem is that if the curve  is a
circle around the origin, say starting at (1, 0) and ending at (1, 0) going counterclockwise,
then if  existed, we would expect

                                       - 
            0 = (1, 0) - (1, 0) =   +   = 2 + 2  + 2 + 2  = 2.

That is nonsense! We leave the computation of the path integral to the interested reader, or
you can consult your multivariable calculus textbook. So there is no potential function 
defined everywhere outside the origin (0, 0).

    The Poincaré Lemma does not guarantee such an  anyway. It only guarantees a
potential function  locally--only in some region containing the initial point. As (1) = 2,
we start at the point (1, 2). Considering  > 0 and integrating  in  or  in , we find

                          (, ) = arctan / .

Figure 1.19: Solution to 2+2 -  + 2+2   = 0, (1) = 2, with initial point marked.

This  is defined on the region  > 0 and so the equation is exact on that region. The
implicit solution is arctan / = . Solving,  = tan(). That is, the solution is a straight
line. Solving (1) = 2 gives us that tan() = 2, and so  = 2 is the desired solution. See
Figure 1.19, and note again that the solution only exists for  > 0.

    If the region where  and  are defined and where  =  has "no holes," such as,
for instance, the entire -plane, then the equation is exact and an  defined on that region
can be found. For example, in Example 1.8.3,  = 2 +  and  =  - 1 are defined in the
entire plane and  = 1 = , so there a global  exists. Similarly, in Example 1.8.4 the
half-plane where  > 0 also has "no holes" and a potential function exists on that region.
So in such cases, checking  =  is good enough to check for being exact.

Example 1.8.5: Solve

                                  2 + 2 + 2( + 1)  = 0  .

    The reader should check that this equation is exact. Let  = 2 + 2 and  = 2( + 1).
We follow the procedure for exact equations

                                  (, ) = 1 3 + 2 + (),
                                              3

and
                                           2( + 1) = 2  + ().

Therefore  ()  =  2  or  ()    =  2  and   (,  )    =  1 3  + 2  +  2.  We        try  to  solve  (,  )  =  .

                                                       3
We easily solve for 2 and then just take the square root:

                     2 =  - (1/3)3  + 1 , so  = ±  - (1/3)3  + 1 .
68                                                    CHAPTER 1. FIRST-ORDER EQUATIONS

When  = -1, the term in front of   is zero, and our explicit solution is not valid. The given

equation has no solution (for ()) near  = -1, but the equation (2+2) +2(+1)  = 0

does have a solution  = -1. In fact, one could solve for  in terms of  for any initial

condition.  The  solution  is  messy,  so  we  leave  it  as  1 3  +  2  +  2  =  .

                                                              3

1.8.2 Integrating factors

Sometimes an equation   +  = 0 is not exact, but it can be made exact by multiplying
with a function (, ). That is, perhaps for some nonzero function (, ),

                           (, )(, )  + (, )(, )  = 0

is exact. Any solution to this new equation is also a solution to   +   = 0.
    In fact, a linear equation

                                                          () -  ()  +  = 0,
                  + () =  (), or

                                                                        

is always such an equation. Let () =  ()  be the integrating factor for the linear
equation. Multiply the equation by () and write it in the form of  +    = 0.

                                                                   
                               ()() - ()  () + ()  = 0.

Then  = ()() - ()  (), so  = ()(), while  = (), so  = () = ()().

In other words, we have an exact equation. Integrating factors for linear functions are just

a special case of integrating factors for exact equations.
    But how do we find the integrating factor ? Well, for   +   = 0 to be exact,

the function  should satisfy

                   =   +  =   =  + .
                                                      

Therefore,

                               ( - ) =   -  .

At first it may seem we replaced one differential equation by another. Even worse, the new

equation is a PDE. True, but all hope is not lost.
    A strategy that often works is to look for a  that is a function of  alone, or a function

of  alone. After all, that is what worked for linear equations. If  is a function of  alone,
that is, (), then we write () instead of , and  is just zero. Then

                                            -   = .
                                               
1.8. EXACT EQUATIONS                                                                  69

In particular,  - ought to be a function of  alone (not depend on ). If so, then we

have a linear equation   -  -   = 0.
                                  

Letting () =  - , we solve the linear equation to find () =  . The constant  () 
in the solution is not relevant, we need any nonzero solution, so we take  = 1. Then
() =  ()  is the integrating factor making the equation exact.

Similarly, we could try a function of the form (). Then

                         -   = -.
                            

In particular,  - ought to be a function of  alone. If so, we have a linear equation

                                               +  -   = 0.
                                                        

Letting () =  - , we find () = - . We take  ()   = 1. So () = - is  () 
the integrating factor.

Example 1.8.6: Solve

                        2 + 2  
                         + 1 + 2  = 0.

                2+2

Let  = +1 and  = 2. Compute

                         -  = 2  + 1 - 0 = 2  + 1 .

As this is not zero, the equation is not exact. We notice

                        () = = =  -  2 1 1
                                + 1 2  + 1

is a function of  alone. We compute the integrating factor

                                                        

                                           ()  = ln(+1) =  + 1.

We multiply our given equation by ( + 1) to obtain
                                          2 + 2 + 2( + 1)  = 0  ,

which is an exact equation that we solved in Example 1.8.5. The solution was

                        =±      - (1/3)3 .
                                  +1
70                                      CHAPTER 1. FIRST-ORDER EQUATIONS

Example 1.8.7: Solve   2 + (  + 1)  = 0  .
    First compute      -  = 2 -  = .

As this is not zero, the equation is not exact. We observe

                      () =  = 2 =  -   1

is a function of  alone. We compute the integrating factor
                                           -  ()  = - ln  = 1 .
                                                                       

Therefore, we look at the exact equation
                                                +   = 0  + 1  .

The reader should double check that this equation is exact. We follow the procedure for

exact equations
                                              (, ) =  + (),

and                    + 1           1

                       =  +  =  +  (). (1.6)                     

Consequently, () = 1/ or () = ln ||. Thus (, ) =   + ln ||. It is not possible
to solve (, ) =  for  in terms of elementary functions, so let us be content with the

implicit solution:
                                                  + ln || = .

We are looking for the general solution and we divided by  above. We should check what
happens when  = 0, as the equation itself makes perfect sense in that case. We plug in
 = 0 to find the equation is satisfied. So  = 0 is also a solution.

1.9 First-order linear PDEs

Note: 1 lecture, can safely be skipped
    We have only considered ODEs so far, so let us solve a linear first-order PDE. Consider

(, )  + (, )  + (, )  = (, ), (, 0) =  (), - <  < ,  > 0,

where  (, )     is  a  function  of    and  .  We  again  use  the  notation      =     and          =     for
                                                                                                         
convenience. The initial condition (, 0) =  () is now a function of  rather than just a

number. In these problems, it is useful to think of  as position and  as time. The equation

describes the evolution of a function of  as time goes on. Below, the coefficients , , ,

and the function  are mostly going to be constant or zero. The method we describe works

with nonconstant coefficients, although the computations may get difficult quickly.

    This method we use is the method of characteristics. The idea is to find lines along

which the equation is an ODE that we then solve. We will see this technique again for

second-order PDEs when we encounter the wave equation in § 4.8.

Example 1.9.1: Consider

                                  +  = 0, (, 0) =  (),

where  is a constant. This particular equation,  +  = 0, is called the transport equation.

    The data will propagate along curves called characteristics. The idea is to change
to the so-called characteristic coordinates, which we will call (, ). If we change to these

coordinates, the equation simplifies. The change of variables for this equation is

                                        =  - ,  = .

Let us see what the equation becomes. Remember the chain rule in several variables.

                                        =  +   = ,
                                        =  +   = - +  .

The equation in the coordinates  and  becomes

                                        () + (- + ) = 0,

                                                   

or in other words,

                                                   = 0.

Treating    as  simply  a  parameter,  we   have   obtained  the  ODE    =    0.  That  is  trivial  to  solve.
                                                                       

    The solution is a function that does not depend on  (but it does depend on ). That is,

there is some function  such that

                                        = () = ( - ).
1.9. FIRST-ORDER LINEAR PDES                                                                                             73

The initial condition says that

                                        () = (, 0) = ( - 0) = (),

so  =  . In other words,

                                                 (, ) =  ( - ).

Everything is simply moving to the right with velocity  as  increases. The curves given
by the equation

                                                   = constant

are called the characteristic curves. See Figure 1.20. In this case, the solution does not change
                                     
along     the  characteristic    as       =  0.

In the (, ) coordinates, the characteristic

curves    satisfy    =   1 (     - ),  and   are     in  fact      lines.         =0 =1 =2

                                                 1,

The   slope    of  characteristic    lines   is      and  for      each

different , we get a different characteristic line.

We see why  +  = 0 is called the transport

equation: Everything travels at some constant

speed. This behavior is called convection. An

example application is material being moved by                                                

a river where the material does not diffuse and                                  Figure 1.20: Characteristic curves.

position along the river,  is the time, and (, )

the concentration the material at position  and time . See Figure 1.21 for an example.

That is assuming  > 0. If  < 0, then we are moving to the left.

    We use a similar idea in the more general case:

                         +  +  = , (, 0) =  ().

We change coordinates to the characteristic coordinates, which we call (, ). These are

coordinates where  +  becomes differentiation in the  variable.

    Along the characteristic curves (where  is constant), we get a new ODE in the  variable.
                                                     
In  the  transport  equation,  we  got  the  simple    =  0.  In  general,  we  get  the  linear  equation

                                              +  = . (1.7)
                                             

We think of everything as a function of  and , although we are thinking of  as a parameter

rather than an independent variable. So the equation is an ODE. It is a linear ODE that we

can solve using the integrating factor.
    To find the characteristics, think of a curve given parametrically (), () . We try to

have the curve satisfy                   = ,            = .
                                                       

Why? Because when we think of  and  as functions of , we find, using the chain rule,

                                         
                        +  =  +  + =  +  +  = .
                                         

                                                                                       
                                                                                       

So we get the ODE (1.7), which then describes the value of the solution  of the PDE along
this characteristic curve. It is convenient to make sure that  = 0 corresponds to  = 0, that
is, (0) = 0. It will also be convenient for (0) = . See Figure 1.22.

                                     = constant
                                                       (), ()

                                        =              =0

Example 1.9.2: Consider                                (, 0) = -2 .
                                     +  +  = ,
1.9. FIRST-ORDER LINEAR PDES                                                                       75

We find the characteristics, that is, the curves given by

                                      = 1,         = 1.
                                                  

So
                                           =  + 1,  =  + 2,

for some 1 and 2. At  = 0, we want  =  and  = 0. So we let 1 =  and 2 = 0:

                                   =  + ,  = .

The  ODE  is    +    =  ,  and    =    +  .  So,  the  ODE  to  solve  along  the  characteristic  is
              

                                                  +  =  + .
                                                 

The general solution of this equation, treating  as a parameter, is  = - +  +  - 1, for
some , which can depend on . At  = 0, our initial condition is that  is -2, since at
 = 0, we have  = . Given this initial condition, we find  = -2 -  + 1. So,

                            = -2 -  + 1 - +  +  - 1
                             = -2- + (1 - )- +  +  - 1.

Substitute  =  -  and  =  to find  in terms of  and :

                         = -2- + (1 - )- +  +  - 1
                          = -(-)2- + (1 -  + )- +  - 1.

See Figure 1.23 on the next page for a plot of (, ) as a function of two variables.

    When the coefficients are not constants, the characteristic curves are not going to be
straight lines anymore.

Example 1.9.3: Consider the following variable-coefficient equation:

                         +  + 2 = 0, (, 0) = cos().

We find the characteristics, that is, the curves given by

                                   = ,             = 1.
                                                  

So
                                            = 1,  =  + 2.

At  = 0, we wish to get  =  and  = 0 as before. So

                                      = ,  = .

    Figure 1.23: Plot of the solution (, ) to  +  +  = , (, 0) = -2.

    OK, the ODE we need to solve is

                                                     + 2 = 0.
                                                    

This is for a fixed . We find  = -2. At  = 0, we want  to be cos(), so that is our
initial condition for the ODE. Hence,  = cos(). We solve for  and  to find  = - and

 = . Consequently,                    = -2 cos() = -2 cos(-).

    We make a few closing remarks. One thing to keep in mind is that we would get into
trouble if the coefficient in front of , that is, the , is ever zero. Let us consider a quick

example of what can go wrong:

                                      +  = 0, (, 0) = sin().

This problem has no solution. If we had a solution, it would imply that (, 0) = cos(),
but (, 0) + (, 0) = cos() + sin()  0. The problem is that the characteristic curve is
now the line  = 0, and the solution is already provided on that line! As  ought to then be
nonzero, it is convenient to ensure that  is positive by multiplying the equation by -1 if
necessary, so that a positive  means a positive .

    Another remark is that if  or  in the equation are not constants, the computations can

quickly get out of hand, as the expressions for the characteristic coordinates become messy
1.9. FIRST-ORDER LINEAR PDES                                               77

and then solving the ODE becomes even messier. In the examples above,  was always 1,
meaning we got  =  in the characteristic coordinates. If  is not constant, your expression
for  will be more complicated.

    Finding the characteristic coordinates is really a system of ODEs in general if  depends
on  or if  depends on . In that case, we would need techniques of systems of ODEs to
solve, see chapter 3 or chapter 8. In general, if  and  are not linear functions or constants,

finding closed form expressions for the characteristic coordinates may be impossible.

    Finally, the method of characteristics applies to nonlinear first-order PDEs as well. In

the nonlinear case, the characteristics depend not only on the differential equation, but

also on the initial data. This leads to not only more difficult computations, but also the

formation of singularities where the solution breaks down at a certain point in time. An

example application where first-order nonlinear PDEs come up is traffic flow theory, and

you have probably experienced the formation of singularities: traffic jams. But we digress.

Higher-order linear ODEs

2.1 Second-order linear ODEs

Note: 1 lecture, reduction of order optional, first part of §3.1 in [EP], parts of §3.1 and §3.2 in [BD]
    Consider the general second-order linear differential equation
                                     () + () + () = ().

We often divide through by () to get

            + () + () =  (),                                          (2.1)

where () = ()/(), () = ()/(), and  () = ()/(). The word linear means that the
equation contains no powers or functions of , , and .

    In the special case when  () = 0, we have a so-called homogeneous equation

            + () + () = 0.                                            (2.2)

We have already seen some second-order linear homogeneous equations.

 + 2  = 0  Two solutions are:         1 = cos(), 2 = sin().
 - 2  = 0  Two solutions are:         1 =   , 2 = -.

    If we know two solutions of a linear homogeneous equation, we know many more of
them.

Theorem 2.1.1 (Superposition). Suppose 1 and 2 are two solutions of the homogeneous equation
(2.2). Then

                                          () = 11() + 22(),

also solves (2.2) for arbitrary constants 1 and 2.
80                                          CHAPTER 2. HIGHER-ORDER LINEAR ODES

    That is, we can add solutions together and multiply them by constants to obtain new
and different solutions. We call the expression 11 + 22 a linear combination of 1 and
2. Let us prove this theorem; the proof is very enlightening and illustrates how linear

equations work.

    Proof: Let  = 11 + 22. Then

        +   +   = (1 1 + 2 2) + (1 1 + 2 2) + (1 1 + 2 2)

       = 1 1 + 2 2 + 1 1 + 2 2 + 1 1 + 2 2

       =       1(1  +                    +   1)  +  2(2  +         +   2)

                           1                                    2

       = 1 · 0 + 2 · 0 = 0. 

    The proof becomes even simpler to state if we use the operator notation. An operator is
an object that eats functions and spits out functions (kind of like what a function is, but a
function eats numbers and spits out numbers). Define the operator  by

                                               =  +   +  .

The differential equation now becomes  = 0. The operator (and the equation)  being
linear means that (11 + 22) = 11 + 22. It is almost as if we were "multiplying"
by . The proof above becomes

                     = (11 + 22) = 11 + 22 = 1 · 0 + 2 · 0 = 0.

    Two different solutions to the second equation  - 2 = 0 are 1 = cosh() and

2 = sinh(). Recalling the definition of sinh and cosh, we note that these are solutions by

superposition as they are linear combinations of the two exponential solutions: cosh() =
  + -                                         - -
       1  1 -                                       1  -1 -
    2 = ( /2) + ( /2) and sinh() = 2 = ( /2) + ( /2) .

    The functions sinh and cosh are sometimes more convenient to use than the exponential.

Let us review some of their properties:

       cosh 0 = 1,                                  sinh 0 = 0,
        cosh  = sinh ,                               sinh  = cosh ,
                                                    
       cosh2  - sinh2  = 1.

Exercise 2.1.1: Derive these properties using the definitions of sinh and cosh in terms of exponen-
tials.

    Linear equations have nice and simple answers to the existence and uniqueness question.

Theorem 2.1.2 (Existence and uniqueness). Suppose , ,  are continuous functions on some
interval ,  is a number in , and 0, 1 are constants. Then the equation

                                          + () + () =  (),

has exactly one solution () defined on the interval  satisfying the initial conditions
                                          () = 0, () = 1.
2.1. SECOND-ORDER LINEAR ODES  81

    For example, the equation  + 2 = 0 with (0) = 0 and (0) = 1 has the solution

                                       () = 0 cos() + 1 sin().

The equation  - 2 = 0 with (0) = 0 and (0) = 1 has the solution

                                     () = 0 cosh() + 1 sinh().

Using cosh and sinh in this solution allows us to solve for the initial conditions in a cleaner
way than if we had used the exponentials.

    The initial conditions for a second-order ODE consist of two equations. Common sense
tells us that if we have two arbitrary constants and two equations, then we should be able
to solve for the constants and find a solution to the differential equation satisfying the
initial conditions.

    Question: Suppose we find two different solutions 1 and 2 to the homogeneous
equation (2.2). Can every solution be written (using superposition) in the form  =
11 + 22?

    The answer is affirmative! Provided that 1 and 2 are different enough in the following
sense. We say 1 and 2 are linearly independent if one is not a constant multiple of the other.

Theorem 2.1.3. Let ,  be continuous functions. Let 1 and 2 be two linearly independent
solutions to the homogeneous equation (2.2). Then every other solution is of the form

                                                 = 11 + 22.

That is,  = 11 + 22 is the general solution.

    For example, we found the solutions 1 = cos  and 2 = sin  for the equation +  = 0.
It is not hard to see that sine and cosine are not constant multiples of each other. Indeed,
if sin  =  cos  for some constant , plugging in  = 0 would imply  = 0. But then
sin  = 0 for all , which is preposterous. So 1 and 2 are linearly independent. Hence,

                                             = 1 cos  + 2 sin 

is the general solution to  +  = 0.
    For two functions, checking linear independence is rather simple. Here is another

example. Consider  - 2-2 = 0. Then 1 = 2 and 2 = 1/ are solutions. To see that
they are linearly independent, suppose one is a multiple of the other: 1 = 2, we just
have to show that  cannot be a constant. In this case, we have  = 1/2 = 3, which is
most decidedly not a constant. So  = 12 + 21/ is the general solution.

    If you have one nonzero solution to a second-order linear homogeneous equation, then
you can find another one. This is the reduction of order method. The idea is that if we
82                                           CHAPTER 2. HIGHER-ORDER LINEAR ODES

somehow found 1 as a solution of  + () + () = 0, then we try a second solution
of the form 2() = 1()(). We just need to find . We plug 2 into the equation:

     0     =  2  +  ()2   +  ()2  =       +  21   +  1  +()  (1   +  1)    +()   1

                                       1

                                                                                      2
                                             2                    2

                                                                                              : 0
                                  = 1 + (21 + ()1) + 1 +()1 +()1 .

                                                                             

In other words, 1 + (21 + ()1) = 0. Using  = , we have the first-order linear
equation 1 + (21 + ()1) = 0. After solving this equation for  (integrating factor),
we find  by antidifferentiating . We then form 2 by computing 1. For example,
suppose we somehow know 1 =  is a solution to  + -1 - -2 = 0. The equation
for  is then  + 3 = 0. We find a solution,  = -3, and we find an antiderivative
     -                          -
  =        Hence    2  =  1  =       Any     works and so    =   -2 makes  2  =  1/.  Thus, the
     22 .                       2 .
general solution is  = 1 + 21/.

    Since we have a formula for the solution to the first-order linear equation, we can write

a formula for 2:                                      
                                2() = 1()
                                                  - () 
                                                               

                                                    1() 2

However, it is much easier to remember that we just need to try 2() = 1()() and find
() as we did above. The technique works for higher-order equations too: You get to

reduce the order by one for each solution you find. So it is better to remember how to do it

rather than a specific formula.

    We will study the solution of nonhomogeneous equations in § 2.5. We will first focus
on finding general solutions to homogeneous equations.

2.2 Constant-coefficient second-order linear ODEs

Note: more than 1 lecture, second part of §3.1 in [EP], §3.1 in [BD]

2.2.1 Solving constant-coefficient equations         (0) = 6.

Consider the problem
                             - 6 + 8 = 0, (0) = -2,

This is a second-order linear homogeneous equation with constant coefficients. Constant
coefficients means that the functions in front of , , and  are constants; they do not
depend on .

    To guess a solution, think of a function that stays essentially the same when we

differentiate it, so that we can take the function and its derivatives, add some multiples of

these together, and end up with zero. Yes, we are talking about the exponential.
    We try a solution of the form  = . Then  =  and  = 2. Plug in to get

                  - 6 + 8 = 0,
    2 -6  +8  = 0,

        

         2 - 6 + 8 = 0          (divide through by ),
      ( - 2)( - 4) = 0.

Hence, if  = 2 or  = 4, then  is a solution. So let 1 = 2 and 2 = 4.

Exercise 2.2.1: Check that 1 and 2 are solutions.

    The functions 2 and 4 are linearly independent. If they were not linearly independent,
we could write 4 = 2 for some constant , implying that 2 =  for all , which is
clearly not possible. Hence, we can write the general solution as

         = 12 + 24.

We need to solve for 1 and 2. To apply the initial conditions, we first find  =
212 + 424. We plug  = 0 into  and  and solve.

        -2 = (0) = 1 + 2,
          6 = (0) = 21 + 42.

     Making an educated guess with some parameters to solve for is such a central technique in differential
equations that people sometimes use a fancy name for such a guess: ansatz, German for "initial placement of
a tool at a work piece." Yes, the Germans have a word for that.
2.2. CONSTANT-COEFFICIENT SECOND-ORDER LINEAR ODES                               85

Either apply some matrix algebra, or just solve these by high school math. For example,
divide the second equation by 2 to obtain 3 = 1 + 22, then subtract the two equations to
get 5 = 2. Then 1 = -7 as -2 = 1 + 5. Hence, the solution we are looking for is

                                                 = -72 + 54 .

We generalize this example into a method. Suppose that we have an equation

                        +   +   = 0,                                             (2.3)

where , ,  are constants. Try the solution  =  to obtain

                      2 +  +  = 0.

Divide by  to obtain the so-called characteristic equation of the ODE:

                      2 +  +  = 0.

Solve for the  by using the quadratic formula:
                                                             

                                           1, 2 = - ± 2 - 4 2 .

Suppose that 2 - 4  0 for now so that 1 and 2 are real. So 1 and 2 are solutions.
There is still a difficulty if 1 = 2, but it is not hard to overcome.

Theorem 2.2.1. Suppose that 1 and 2 are the roots of the characteristic equation.

   (i) If 1 and 2 are distinct and real (when 2 - 4 > 0), then (2.3) has the general solution

                       = 11 + 22 .

(ii) If 1 = 2 (happens when 2 - 4 = 0), then (2.3) has the general solution
                                                 = (1 + 2) 1.

Example 2.2.1: Solve

                       - 2 = 0.

The characteristic equation is 2 - 2 = 0 or ( - )( + ) = 0. Consequently, - and  

are the two linearly independent solutions, and the general solution is

                       = 1 + 2-.

Since cosh  = 2 +- and sinh  = 2 -- , we can also write the general solution as

                       = 1 cosh() + 2 sinh().

Example 2.2.2: Find the general solution of

                                               - 8 + 16 = 0.

    The characteristic equation is 2 - 8 + 16 = ( - 4)2 = 0. The equation has a double root
1 = 2 = 4. The general solution is, therefore,

                                    = (1 + 2) 4 = 14 + 24.
Exercise 2.2.2: Check that 4 and 4 are linearly independent.

    It is good to check your work. That 4 solves the equation is clear. Let us check that
4 solves the equation. Compute  = 4 + 44 and  = 84 + 164. Plug in,

                    - 8 + 16 = 84 + 164 - 8(4 + 44) + 164 = 0.

    In some sense, a double root rarely happens. If coefficients are picked randomly, a
double root is unlikely. There are, however, some real-world problems where a double
root does happen naturally (e.g. critically damped mass-spring system, as we will see).

    Here is a short argument for why the solution  works for a double root. A double
root is a limit case of two distinct but very close roots. Note that 2-1 2-1 is a solution when
the roots are distinct. When we take the limit as 1 goes to 2, we are really taking the
derivative of  using  as the variable. Therefore, the limit is , and hence this is a
solution in the double root case. We remark that in some numerical computations, two
very close roots may lead to numerical instability while a double root will not.

2.2.2 Complex numbers and Euler's formula

A polynomial may have complex roots. The equation 2 + 1 = 0 has no real roots, but it
does have two complex roots. Here we review some properties of complex numbers.

    Complex numbers may seem a strange concept, perhaps due to the terminology. There
is nothing imaginary or complicated about complex numbers. A complex number is simply
a pair of real numbers, (, ), that is, it is a point in the plane. We add complex numbers in
the straightforward way: (, ) + (, ) = ( + ,  + ). We define multiplication by

                                                                          def

                                    (, ) × (, ) = ( - ,  + ).

It turns out that with this multiplication rule, all the standard properties of arithmetic hold.
Further, and most importantly (0, 1) × (0, 1) = (-1, 0).

    Generally we write (, ) as  + , and we treat  as if it were an unknown. When  is
zero, then (, 0) is just the number . We do arithmetic with complex numbers just as we
would with polynomials. The property we just mentioned becomes 2 = -1. So whenever
we see 2, we replace it by -1. For example,

            (2 + 3)(4) - 5 = (2 × 4) + (3 × 4)2 - 5 = 8 + 12(-1) - 5 = -12 + 3.

    The numbers  and - are the two roots of 2 + 1 = 0. Some engineers use the letter 
instead of  for the square root of -1. We follow the mathematicians' convention and use .
2.2. CONSTANT-COEFFICIENT SECOND-ORDER LINEAR ODES                                         87

Exercise 2.2.3: Make sure you understand (that you can justify) the following identities:

a) 2 = -1, 3 = -, 4 = 1,                b)  1  = -,
                                            

c) (3 - 7)(-2 - 9) = · · · = -69 - 13,  d) (3-2)(3+2) = 32 -(2)2 = 32 +22 = 13,

e) 1 = 1 3+2 = 3+2 = 3 + 2 .
3-2 3-2 3+2  13           13 13

    We also define the exponential  + of a complex number by writing down the Taylor
series and plugging in the complex number. Most properties of the exponential follow
from its Taylor series, and so these properties hold for the complex exponential too. For
example, we have the property: + =   . In particular,  + =   . Hence, if we can
compute , we can compute  +. For , we use the so-called Euler's formula.

Theorem 2.2.2 (Euler's formula).

 = cos  +  sin  and - = cos  -  sin .

In other words,  + =   cos() +  sin() =   cos() +   sin().

Exercise 2.2.4: Using Euler's formula, check the identities:

                           + -                                 - -
             cos  = 2                   and sin  = 2 .

Exercise 2.2.5 (Double angle identities): Start with (2) =  2. Use Euler on each side to

deduce:
                   cos(2) = cos2  - sin2  and sin(2) = 2 sin  cos .

    For a complex number  + , we call  the real part and  the imaginary part of the
number. Often the following notation is used:

             Re( + ) =  and Im( + ) = .

2.2.3 Complex roots

Suppose the differential equation   +   +   = 0 has the characteristic equation
2 +  +  = 0 that has complex roots. By the quadratic formula, the roots are -± 22-4 .
These roots are complex if 2 - 4 < 0. In this case, we write the roots as

                                                             
                                          1, 2 = - 2 ±  4 - 2 2 .

As you can see, we get a pair of roots of the form  ± . We could still write the solution as

                                          = 1(+) + 2(-).
88                       CHAPTER 2. HIGHER-ORDER LINEAR ODES

However, the exponential is now complex-valued. We need to allow 1 and 2 to be
complex numbers to obtain a real-valued solution (which is what we are after). While
there is nothing particularly wrong with this approach, it can make calculations harder
and it is generally preferred to find two real-valued solutions.

    Euler's formula comes to the rescue. Let

                                  1 = (+) and 2 = (-) .

Then                     1 =  cos() +  sin(),
                         2 =  cos() -  sin().

Linear combinations of solutions are also solutions. Hence,
                                         3 = = 1 + 2  cos(),
                                                    2
                                                1 - 2 
                                         4 = 2 =  sin(),

are also solutions. It is not hard to see that 3 and 4 are linearly independent (not multiples
of each other). So the general solution can be written in terms of 3 and 4. And as they

are real-valued, no complex numbers need to be used for the arbitrary constants in the

general solution. We summarize what we found as a theorem.

Theorem 2.2.3. Take the equation
                                                +   +   = 0.

If the characteristic equation has the roots  ±  (when 2 - 4 < 0), then the general solution is

                          = 1 cos() + 2 sin().

Example 2.2.3: Find the general solution of  + 2 = 0, for a constant  > 0.
    The characteristic equation is 2 + 2 = 0, and the roots are  = ± . By the theorem,

the general solution is

                          = 1 cos() + 2 sin().

Example 2.2.4: Find the solution of  - 6 + 13 = 0, (0) = 0, (0) = 10.

    The characteristic equation is 2 - 6 + 13 = 0. Completing the square, we get
( - 3)2 + 22 = 0 and hence the roots are  = 3 ± 2. Per the theorem, the general solution is

                          = 13 cos(2) + 23 sin(2).

To find the solution satisfying the initial conditions, we first plug in zero to get

                         0 = (0) = 10 cos 0 + 20 sin 0 = 1.

Hence, 1 = 0 and  = 23 sin(2). We differentiate,
                                    = 323 sin(2) + 223 cos(2).

We again plug in the initial condition and obtain 10 = (0) = 22, or 2 = 5. The solution

we are seeking is         = 53 sin(2).

2.3 Higher-order linear ODEs

Note: somewhat more than 1 lecture, §3.2 and §3.3 in [EP], §4.1 and §4.2 in [BD]

    We briefly study higher-order equations. Equations appearing in applications tend to
be second-order. Higher-order equations do appear from time to time, but generally the
world around us is "second-order."

    The basic results about linear ODEs of higher order are essentially the same as for second-
order equations, with 2 replaced by . The important concept of linear independence is
somewhat more complicated when more than two functions are involved. For higher-order
constant-coefficient ODEs, the methods developed are also somewhat harder to apply, but
we will not dwell on these complications. It is also possible to use the methods for systems
of linear equations from chapter 3 to solve higher-order constant-coefficient equations.

    Consider a general homogeneous linear equation

          () + -1()(-1) + · · · + 1() + 0() = 0.                                             (2.4)

Theorem 2.3.1 (Superposition). If 1, 2, . . . ,  are solutions of the homogeneous equation
(2.4), then

                                () = 11() + 22() + · · · +  ()

also solves (2.4) for arbitrary constants 1, 2, . . . , .

    That is, a linear combination of solutions to (2.4) is a solution to (2.4). There is also the
existence and uniqueness theorem for linear equations, including nonhomogeneous ones.

Theorem 2.3.2 (Existence and uniqueness). Suppose 0, 1, . . . , -1, and  are continuous
functions on some interval ,  is a number in , and 0, 1, . . . , -1 are constants. Then the

equation  () + -1()(-1) + · · · + 1() + 0() =  ()

has exactly one solution () defined on the same interval  satisfying the initial conditions

          () = 0, () = 1, . . . , (-1)() = -1.

2.3.1 Linear independence

When we had two functions 1 and 2, we said they were linearly independent if one was
not a multiple of the other. Same idea holds for  functions, although in this case it is
easier to state as follows. The functions 1, 2, . . . ,  are linearly independent if the equation

                                         11 + 22 + · · · +   = 0

has only the trivial solution 1 = 2 = · · · =  = 0, where the equation must hold for all .
If we can solve the equation with some constants 1, 2, . . . , , where for example 1  0,
then we can solve for 1 as a linear combination of the others. If the functions are not
linearly independent, they are linearly dependent.
2.3. HIGHER-ORDER LINEAR ODES                                                91

Example 2.3.1: Verify that  , 2 , 3 are linearly independent.

Let us give several ways to show this fact. Many textbooks (including [EP] and [F])

introduce Wronskians, but it is difficult to see why they work and they are not really

necessary here.

Consider

                      1 + 22 + 33 = 0.

We use rules of exponentials and write  = . Hence 2 = 2 and 3 = 3. Then we have

                      1 + 22 + 33 = 0.

The left-hand side is a third degree polynomial in . It is either identically zero, or it has
at most 3 zeros. Therefore, it is identically zero, 1 = 2 = 3 = 0, and the functions are
linearly independent.

    Let us try another way. As before we write

                      1 + 22 + 33 = 0.

This equation has to hold for all . We divide through by 3 to get

                      1-2 + 2- + 3 = 0.

As the equation is true for all , let   . After taking the limit we see that 3 = 0. Hence

our equation becomes

                      1 + 22 = 0.

Rinse, repeat!
    How about yet another way. We again write

                      1 + 22 + 33 = 0.

We can evaluate the equation and its derivatives at different values of  to obtain equations
for 1, 2, and 3. Let us first divide by  for simplicity.

                      1 + 2 + 32 = 0.

We set  = 0 to get the equation 1 + 2 + 3 = 0. Now differentiate both sides

                      2 + 232 = 0.

We set  = 0 to get 2 + 23 = 0. We divide by  again and differentiate to get 23 = 0.
It is clear that 3 is zero. Then 2 must be zero as 2 = -23, and 1 must be zero because
1 + 2 + 3 = 0.

    There is no one best way to do it. All of these methods are perfectly valid. The important

thing is to understand why the functions are linearly independent.
92                                                     CHAPTER 2. HIGHER-ORDER LINEAR ODES

Example 2.3.2: On the other hand, the functions , -, and cosh  are linearly dependent.
Simply apply definition of the hyperbolic cosine:

                         cosh  =  + - or 2 cosh  -  - - = 0.
                                         2

    Once we have enough linearly independent solutions, we have the general solution to
the homogeneous equation, just as we did for second-order equations.

Theorem 2.3.3. If 1, 2, . . . ,  are linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous equation
(2.4), then the general solution to (2.4) can be written as

                                () = 11() + 22() + · · · +  ().

2.3.2 Constant-coefficient higher-order ODEs

When we have a higher-order constant-coefficient homogeneous linear equation, the song

and dance is exactly the same as it was for second order. We just need to find more
solutions. If the equation is th-order, we need to find  linearly independent solutions. It

is best seen by example.

Example 2.3.3: Find the general solution to                                             (2.5)
                                            - 3 -  + 3 = 0.

    Try:  = . We plug in and get
                                    3 -3 2 -   +3  = 0.

                                                                         

We divide through by . Then

                                                     3 - 32 -  + 3 = 0.

The trick now is to find the roots. There is a formula for the roots of degree 3 and 4

polynomials, but it is very complicated. There is no formula for higher degree polynomials.
That does not mean that the roots do not exist. There are always  roots for an th degree

polynomial. They may be repeated and they may be complex. Computers are pretty good

at finding roots approximately for reasonable size polynomials.

    A good place to start is to plot the polynomial and check where it is zero. We can also
simply try plugging in. We just start plugging in numbers  = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, . . . and see if

we get a hit (we can also try complex numbers). Even if we do not get a hit, we may get
an indication of where the root is. For example, we plug  = -2 into our polynomial and
get -15; we plug in  = 0 and get 3. That means there is a root between  = -2 and  = 0,
because the sign changed. If we find one root, say 1, then we know ( - 1) is a factor of

our polynomial. Polynomial long division can then be used.
    A good strategy is to begin with  = 0, 1, or -1. These are easy to compute. Our

polynomial has two such roots, 1 = -1 and 2 = 1. There should be 3 roots and the last
root is reasonably easy to find. The constant term in a monic polynomial such as this is the

    The word monic means that the coefficient of the top degree , in our case 3, is 1.
2.3. HIGHER-ORDER LINEAR ODES                                                  93

product of the negations of all the roots because 3 - 32 -  + 3 = ( - 1)( - 2)( - 3). So

                                 3 = (-1)(-2)(-3) = (1)(-1)(-3) = 3.
You should check that 3 = 3 really is a root. Hence -,  and 3 are solutions to (2.5).
They are linearly independent as can easily be checked, and there are 3 of them, which
happens to be exactly the number we need. So the general solution is

                                           = 1- + 2 + 33.

    Suppose we were given some initial conditions (0) = 1, (0) = 2, and (0) = 3. Then

                                          1 = (0) = 1 + 2 + 3,
                                         2 = (0) = -1 + 2 + 33,
                                        3 = (0) = 1 + 2 + 93.

It is possible to find the solution by high school algebra, but it would be a pain. The

sensible way to solve a system of equations such as this is to use matrix algebra, see § 3.2
or appendix A. For now we note that the solution is 1 = -1/4, 2 = 1, and 3 = 1/4. The
specific solution to the ODE is

                       = -1 - +   + 1 3 .
                      4                      4

    Next, suppose that we have real roots, but they are repeated. Let us say we have a root
 repeated  times. In the spirit of the second-order solution, and for the same reasons, we

have the solutions     ,  , 2 , . . . , -1 .

We take a linear combination of these solutions to find the general solution.

Example 2.3.4: Solve

                      (4) - 3 + 3 -  = 0.

We note that the characteristic equation is

                      4 - 33 + 32 -  = 0.

By inspection, we note that 4 - 33 + 32 -  = ( - 1)3. Hence the roots given with
multiplicity are  = 0, 1, 1, 1. Thus the general solution is

                       = (1 + 2 + 32)  + 4 .

                      terms coming from =1 from =0

    The case of complex roots is similar to second-order equations. Complex roots always
come in pairs  =  ± . Suppose we have two such complex roots, each repeated  times.
The corresponding solution is

     (0 + 1 + · · · + -1-1)  cos() + (0 + 1 + · · · + -1-1)  sin(),

Example 2.3.5: Solve

                      (4) - 4 + 8 - 8 + 4 = 0.

    The characteristic equation is

                      4 - 43 + 82 - 8 + 4 = 0,
                                 (2 - 2 + 2)2 = 0,
                                 ( - 1)2 + 1 2 = 0.

Hence the roots are 1 ± , both with multiplicity 2. Hence the general solution to the ODE is
                               = (1 + 2)  cos  + (3 + 4)  sin .

The way we solved the characteristic equation above is really by guessing or by inspection.
It is not so easy in general. We could also have asked a computer or an advanced calculator
for the roots.

2.4 Mechanical vibrations

Note: 2 lectures, §3.4 in [EP], §3.7 in [BD]
    Let us look at some applications of linear second-order constant-coefficient equations.

2.4.1 Some examples

Our first example is a mass on a spring. Suppose we have                      ()

a mass  > 0 (in kilograms) connected by a spring with                       

spring constant  > 0 (in newtons per meter) to a fixed wall.                          

There may be some external force () (in newtons) acting on    damping 
the mass. Here,  is time in seconds. Finally, there is some

friction measured by   0 (in newton-seconds per meter) as the mass slides along the

floor (or perhaps a damper is connected).

    Let  be the displacement of the mass in meters ( = 0 is the rest position), with 

growing to the right (away from the wall). The force exerted by the spring is proportional to
the compression of the spring by Hooke's law. Therefore, it is  in the negative direction.

Similarly, the force exerted by friction is proportional to the velocity of the mass. Newton's
second law says that force equals mass times acceleration. Hence,  = () -  -  or

                      +  +  = ().

The equation is a linear second-order constant-coefficient ODE. We say the motion is
   (i) forced if  0 (if  is not identically zero),
  (ii) unforced or free if   0 (if  is identically zero),

 (iii) damped if  > 0, and
 (iv) undamped if  = 0.

    This system appears in lots of applications even if it does not at first seem like it. Many
real-world scenarios can be simplified to a mass on a spring. For example, a bungee
jump setup is essentially a mass and spring system (you are the mass). It would be good
if someone did the math before you jump off the bridge, right? Let us give two other
examples.

    Here is an example for electrical engineers. Consider the pictured

RLC circuit. There is a resistor with a resistance of  ohms, an inductor E  C
with an inductance of  henries, and a capacitor with a capacitance                  L
of  farads. There is also an electric source (such as a battery) with
                                                                            R

voltage of () volts at time  (measured in seconds). Let () be the

charge (in coulombs) on the capacitor and () be the current (in amperes) in the circuit.
2.4. MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS                                                              97

The relation between the two is  = . By elementary principles, we find  +  + / = .

We differentiate to get

                             () + () + 1 () = ().
                                                   

This is a nonhomogeneous second-order constant-coefficient linear equation. As , , and
 are all positive, this circuit behaves just like the mass and spring system. Position of

the mass is replaced by current. Mass is replaced by inductance, damping is replaced by

resistance, and the spring constant is replaced by one over the capacitance. The change in

voltage becomes the forcing function--for constant voltage this is an unforced motion.

    Our next example behaves like a mass and spring system                       
only approximately. Suppose a mass  hangs on a pendulum
of length . We seek an equation for the angle () (in radians).                 
Let  be the acceleration due to gravity. Elementary physics                      

mandates that the equation is                                           sin       

                               +  sin   = 0.

    Let us derive this equation using Newton's second law: force
equals mass times acceleration. The acceleration is  and
mass is . So  has to be equal to the tangential component of the force given by
the gravity, which is   sin  in the opposite direction. So  = -  sin . The 

curiously cancels from the equation.
    Now we make our approximation. For small  we have that approximately sin   .

This can be seen by looking at the graph. In Figure 2.1, we can see that for approximately

-0.5 <  < 0.5 (in radians) the graphs of sin  and  are almost the same.

Therefore, when the swings are small,          -1.0  -0.5       0.0      0.5      1.0

is small, and we can model the behavior by 1.0                                         1.0

the simpler linear equation

 +  0.5 0.5  = 0.
       

The errors from this approximation build 0.0                                           0.0

up. After a long time, the state of the real-

world system might be substantially differ- -0.5                                       -0.5

ent from our solution. Also, we will see that

in a mass-spring system, the amplitude is -1.0                                         -1.0

independent of the period. This is not true -1.0     -0.5       0.0      0.5      1.0

for a pendulum. Nevertheless, for reason- Figure 2.1: The graphs of sin  and  (in radians).

ably short periods of time and small swings

(that is, only small angles ), the approximation is reasonably good.

In real-world problems it is often necessary to make these types of simplifications.

We must understand both the mathematics and the physics of the situation to see if the

simplification is valid in the context of the questions we are trying to answer.

2.4.2 Free undamped motion

In this section we only consider free or unforced motion, as we do not know yet how to
solve nonhomogeneous equations. We start with undamped motion where  = 0. The

equation is

                                               +  = 0.

We divide by  and let 0 = / to rewrite the equation as

                                               + 20  = 0.

The general solution to this equation is

                                    () =  cos(0) +  sin(0).

By a trigonometric identity

                                cos(0) +  sin(0) =  cos(0 - ),

for two different constants  and . One finds that  =  cos  and  =  sin , and
therefore it is not hard to compute that  = 2 + 2 and tan  = /. Therefore, we let 

and  be our arbitrary constants and write () =  cos(0 - ).

Exercise 2.4.1: Justify the identity  cos(0) +  sin(0) =  cos(0 - ) and verify the
equations  = 2 + 2 and tan  =  . Hint: Start with cos( - ) = cos() cos() +
sin() sin() and multiply by . Then what should  and  be?

    While it is easier to use the first form with  and  to solve for the initial conditions,
the second form is more natural. The constants  and  have nice physical interpretation.

Write the solution as

                                          () =  cos(0 - ).

This is a pure-frequency oscillation (a sine wave). The amplitude is , 0 is the (angular)

frequency, and  is the so-called phase shift. The phase shift just shifts the graph left or right.

We call 0 the natural (angular) frequency. This entire setup is called simple harmonic motion.

    Let us pause to explain the word angular before the word frequency. The units of 0

are radians per unit time, not cycles per unit time as is the usual measure of frequency.
                                                                               0
Because  one   cycle    is  2  radians,  the  usual  frequency  is  given  by       It  is  simply  a  matter  of
                                                                               2 .
where we put the constant 2, and that is a matter of taste.

    The period of the motion is one over the frequency (in cycles per unit time) and hence it

is  2    That  is  the  amount  of  time  it  takes  to  complete  one  full  cycle.

    0 .

Example 2.4.1: Suppose that  = 2 kg and  = 8 N/m. The whole mass and spring setup

is sitting on a truck that was traveling at 1 m/s. The truck crashes and hence stops. The

mass was held in place 0.5 meters forward from the rest position. During the crash

the mass gets loose. That is, the mass is now moving forward at 1 m/s, while the other

end of the spring is held in place. The mass therefore starts oscillating. What is the
2.4. MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS                                                                             99

frequency of the resulting oscillation? What is the amplitude? The units are the mks units

(meters-kilograms-seconds).

The setup means that the mass was at half a meter in the positive direction during the

crash and relative to the wall the spring is mounted to, the mass was moving forward (in

the positive direction) at 1 m/s. This gives the initial conditions. So the equation with initial

conditions is

                 2 + 8 = 0,           (0) = 0.5,       (0) = 1.
                    

We compute 0 = / = 4 = 2. Hence the angular frequency is 2. The usual frequency

in Hertz (cycles per second) is 2/2 = 1/  0.318.

The general solution is

                               () =  cos(2) +  sin(2).

Letting (0) = 0.5 means  = 0.5. Then () = -2(0.5) sin(2)+2 cos(2). Letting (0) = 1,
                                                                      
we get  = 0.5. Therefore, the amplitude is  = 2 + 2 = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5  0.707.

The solution is

                               () = 0.5 cos(2) + 0.5 sin(2).

A plot of () is shown in Figure 2.2.

    In general, for free undamped motion, a 0.0 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0
solution of the form 1.0 1.0

() =  cos(0) +  sin(0),

                                             0.5                                                 0.5

corresponds to the initial conditions (0) =

 and (0) = 0. It is easy to find  and        0.0                                                 0.0

from the initial conditions. The amplitude

and the phase shift are computed from 

and . In the example, we found the ampli- -0.5                                                   -0.5

tude . How about the phase shift . We

know tan  = / = 1. The arctangent of -1.0                                                        -1.0

1 is /4 or approximately 0.785. We must           0.0  2.5       5.0  7.5                        10.0

the angle from the positive -axis is in the

same quadrant as the point (, )--if not, we add . That is because  =  cos  and

 =  sin . Both  and  are positive, so  must be in the first quadrant. As /4 radians is

in the first quadrant,  = /4.

    Note: Many calculators and computer software have not only the atan function for
arctangent, but also what is sometimes called atan2. This function takes two arguments, 
and , and returns a  in the correct quadrant for you.

2.4.3 Free damped motion

Let us now focus on damped motion. We rewrite the equation
                                               +  +  = 0,
100                                  CHAPTER 2. HIGHER-ORDER LINEAR ODES

as
                                              + 2 + 20  = 0,

where

                                0 =        ,         =  .
                                                          2
                                     

The characteristic equation is

                                2 + 2 + 02 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, we get that the roots are

                                               = - ± 2 - 20.

The form of the solution depends on whether we get complex or real roots. We get real
roots if and only if the following number is nonnegative:

                                    2 - 02 =  2 2 -  = 42 2 - 4 .
The sign of 2 - 20 is the same as the sign of 2 - 4. Thus we get real roots if and only if
2 - 4 is nonnegative, or in other words if 2  4.

Overdamping

When 2-4 > 0, the system is overdamped.              0        25  50  75  100

In this case, there are two distinct real roots 1.5                       1.5

1 and 2. As 2 - 20 is always less than ,

the expression for the roots - ± 2 - 20 1.0                               1.0

is negative either way. So both roots are

negative.                                       0.5                       0.5

The solution is

           () = 1 1 + 2 2 . 0.0 0.0

Since 1, 2 are negative, ()  0 as   . 0                       25  50  75  100

Thus the mass will tend towards the rest        Figure 2.3: Overdamped motion for several differ-
position as time goes to infinity. For a few    ent initial conditions.
sample plots for different initial conditions,

see Figure 2.3.
    No oscillation happens. In fact, the graph crosses the -axis at most once. To see why,

we try to solve 0 = 11 + 22. Therefore, 11 = -22 and using laws of exponents

we obtain                       -1 = (2-1) .
                                 2
2.4. MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS                                                         101

This equation has at most one solution   0; the graph of (2-1) is either always increasing
or always decreasing. For some initial conditions the graph never crosses the -axis, as is

evident from the sample graphs.

Example 2.4.2: Suppose the mass is released from rest. That is, (0) = 0 and (0) = 0.

Then          () = 0   1 - 2 12 - 21 .

It is not hard to see that this satisfies the initial conditions.

Critical damping

When 2 - 4 = 0, the system is critically damped. In this case, there is one root of
multiplicity 2 and this root is -. Our solution is

                                           () = 1- + 2- .

The behavior of a critically damped system is very similar to an overdamped system. After
all, a critically damped system is, in some sense, a limit of overdamped systems. Since
these equations are really only an approximation to the real world, in reality, we are never
critically damped; it is a place we can only reach in theory. We are always a little bit
underdamped or a little bit overdamped. It is better not to dwell on critical damping.

Underdamping

When 2 - 4 < 0, the system is under-        0  5                   10  15  20  25  30

damped. In this case, the roots are complex. 1.0 1.0

or                                    Figure 2.4: Underdamped motion with the envelope
           () = - cos(1 - ).          curves shown.

An example plot is given in Figure 2.4. Note that we still have that ()  0 as   .
    The figure also shows the envelope curves - and --. The solution is the oscillating

line between the two envelope curves. The envelope curves give the maximum amplitude
of the oscillation at any given point in time. For example, if you are bungee jumping, you
are really interested in computing the envelope curve so as not to hit the concrete with
102  CHAPTER 2. HIGHER-ORDER LINEAR ODES

your head. The phase shift  shifts the oscillation left or right, but within the envelope

curves (the envelope curves do not change if  changes).
    Notice that the angular pseudo-frequency 1 becomes smaller when the damping  (and

hence ) becomes larger. This makes sense. First, when we change the damping just a little

bit, we do not expect the behavior of the solution to change dramatically. Second, if we
keep making  larger, then at some point the solution should start looking like the solution
for critical damping or overdamping, where no oscillation happens. As  gets larger and 2
approaches 4, we find that 1 approaches 0. On the other hand, when  gets smaller,
1 approaches 0 (1 is always smaller than 0), and the solution looks more and more

like the steady periodic motion of the undamped case. The envelope curves become flatter
and flatter as  (and hence ) goes to 0.

2.5 Nonhomogeneous equations

Note: 2 lectures, §3.5 in [EP], §3.5 and §3.6 in [BD]

2.5.1 Solving nonhomogeneous equations

We have solved linear constant-coefficient homogeneous equations. What about nonhomo-
geneous linear ODEs? For example, the equations for forced mechanical vibrations. That
is, consider an equation such as

                                     + 5 + 6 = 2 + 1.                                                  (2.6)

We will write  = 2 + 1 when the exact form of the operator is not important. We
solve (2.6) in the following manner. First, we find the general solution  to the associated

homogeneous equation

                                        + 5 + 6 = 0.                                                   (2.7)

We call  the complementary solution. Next, we find a single particular solution  to (2.6) in

some way. Then

                                        =  + 

is the general solution to (2.6). We have  = 0 and  = 2 + 1. As  is a linear operator,
we verify that  is a solution:  = ( + ) =  +  = 0 + (2 + 1).

    Let us see why we obtain the general solution. Let  and ~ be two different particular
solutions to (2.6). Write the difference as  =  - ~. Then plug  into the left-hand side

of the equation to get

       +  5  +  6     =  (    +  5  +  6)  -  (~  +  5~  +  6 ~  )  =  (2  +  1)  -  (2  +  1)  =  0.

                            

With the operator notation, the calculation becomes even clearer. As  is a linear operator,

                 = ( - ~) =  - ~ = (2 + 1) - (2 + 1) = 0.

So  =  - ~ is a solution to (2.7), that is,  = 0. Any two solutions of (2.6) differ by a
solution to the homogeneous equation (2.7). The solution  =  +  includes all solutions
to (2.6), since  is the general solution to the associated homogeneous equation.

Theorem 2.5.1. Let  =  () be a linear ODE (not necessarily constant-coefficient). Let  be
the complementary solution (the general solution to the associated homogeneous equation  = 0)
and let  be any particular solution to  =  (). Then the general solution to  =  () is

                                        =  + .

    The moral of the story is that we can find the particular solution in any old way. If we
find a different particular solution (by a different method or by simply guessing), then we
still get the same general solution. The formula may look different, and the constants we
have to choose to satisfy the initial conditions may be different, but it is the same solution.
2.5. NONHOMOGENEOUS EQUATIONS                                                                        105

2.5.2 Undetermined coefficients

The trick is to somehow, in a smart way, guess one particular solution to (2.6). Note that
2 + 1 is a polynomial, and the left-hand side of the equation will be a polynomial if we let
 be a polynomial of the same degree. Let us try

                                         =  + .

We plug  into the left-hand side to obtain

                  +  5  +  6  =  (      +    )  +    5(     +  )  +   6(    +  )

              

                              = 0 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 6 + (5 + 6).

So  6 +(5 +6)  =  2 +1.    Therefore,        =  1/3  and    =  -1/9.  That  means     =  1  -  1  =  9 3-1 .
                                                                                         3     9

Solving the complementary problem (exercise!), we get

                                  = 1-2 + 2-3 .

Hence the general solution to (2.6) is

                                        = 1-2 + 2-3 + 3 - 1 .
                                                                         9

Now suppose we are further given some initial conditions. For example, (0) = 0 and
(0) = 1/3. First find  = -21-2 - 32-3 + 1/3. Then

              0 = (0) = 1 + 2 - 1 ,             1 = (0) = -21 - 32 + 1 .
                                          9     3                                  3

We solve to get 1 = 1/3 and 2 = -2/9. The particular solution we want is

                = 1 -2 - 2 -3 + 3 - 1 = 3-2 - 2-3 + 3 - 1 .
                     3     9                 9                        9

Exercise 2.5.1: Check that  really solves the equation (2.6) and the given initial conditions.

    Note: A common mistake is to solve for constants using the initial conditions with 
and only add the particular solution  after that. That will not work. You need to first
compute  =  +  and only then solve for the constants using the initial conditions.

    Another important remark is that you should not forget the lower degree terms, even if
they do not appear on the right-hand side. If the equation is  = 3 + 1, you must try
 = 3 + 2 +  + , even though there is no 2 nor  on the right-hand side of the

equation. It is a general polynomial of degree 3 that must be tried.

    A right-hand side consisting of exponentials, sines, and cosines can be handled similarly.

For example,

                               + 2 + 2 = cos(2).
106                                    CHAPTER 2. HIGHER-ORDER LINEAR ODES

Let us find some . We start by guessing the solution includes some multiple of cos(2).
We may have to also add a multiple of sin(2) to our guess since derivatives of cosine are

sines. We try

                                 =  cos(2) +  sin(2).

We plug  into the equation and we get

-4 cos(2) - 4 sin(2) +2 -2 sin(2) + 2 cos(2)

                                       

                 

                                             + 2  cos(2) +  sin(2) = cos(2),

                                                                                                                     

or
                  (-4 + 4 + 2) cos(2) + (-4 - 4 + 2) sin(2) = cos(2).

The left-hand side must equal the right-hand side. Namely, -4 + 4 + 2 = 1 and
-4 - 4 + 2 = 0. So -2 + 4 = 1 and 2 +  = 0 and hence  = -1/10 and  = 1/5. So

                           =  cos(2) +  sin(2) = - cos(2) + 2 sin(2) .
                                                                            10

    Similarly, if the right-hand side contains exponentials, we try exponentials. If

                                                      = 3,

we try  = 3 as our guess and try to solve for .

    When the right-hand side is a multiple of sines, cosines, exponentials, and polynomials,
we can use the product rule for differentiation to come up with a guess. We need to guess
a form for  such that  is of the same form, and has all the terms needed for the
right-hand side. For example,

                                          = (1 + 32) - cos().

For this equation, we guess

                = ( +  + 2) - cos() + ( +  + 2) - sin().

We plug in and then hopefully get equations that we can solve for , , , , , and . As
you can see this can make for a very long and tedious calculation very quickly. C'est la vie!

    There is one hiccup in all this. It could be that our guess actually solves the associated
homogeneous equation. That is, consider

                                       - 9 = 3 .

We would love to guess  = 3, but if we plug this into the left-hand side of the equation,

we get                                93     93            3 .

                             -  9  =      -       =  0  

                   
2.5. NONHOMOGENEOUS EQUATIONS                                                             107

There is no way to choose  to make the left-hand side 3. The trick is to multiply our

guess by  to get rid of duplication with the complementary solution. First, we find 

(solution to  = 0),                     = 1-3 + 23 .

We note that the 3 term is a duplicate with our desired guess. We modify our guess to
       3                                                                         3  + 33
    =      so  that  there  is  no  duplication  anymore.  Let  us  try:      =           and

                                                                            

    =  63  +  93,    so

  

                            -  9    =  63  +  93  -  93         =   6 3 .

                     

Thus 63 is supposed to equal 3. Hence, 6 = 1 and so  = 1/6. We can now write the

general solution as

                             =  +  = 1-3 + 23 + 1 3 .
                                                                     6

    It is possible that multiplying by  does not get rid of all duplication. Consider,

                                        - 6 + 9 = 3 .

The complementary solution is  = 13 + 23. Guessing  = 3 does not get us
anywhere. We want to guess  = 23. Basically, we multiply our guess by  until all
duplication is gone. But no more! Multiplying too many times will not work.

    Also make sure to look for duplication in the entire expression you try. For the equation
 -  = , where  = 1 + 2-, it is not enough that  does not appear in .
Trying  =  +  will not work as  appears in , you must try  =  + 2.

    Finally, what if the right-hand side has several terms, such as
                                                = 2 + cos .

In this case, we find  that solves  = 2 and  that solves  = cos  (that is, do each
term separately). If we set  =  + , then we find our desired particular solution. That is
because  is linear; we have  = ( + ) =  +  = 2 + cos .

2.5.3 Variation of parameters

The method of undetermined coefficients works for many basic problems that crop up.
But it does not work all the time. It only works when the right-hand side of the equation
 =  () has finitely many linearly independent derivatives, so that we can write a guess
that consists of them all. Some equations are a bit tougher. Consider

                                                  +  = tan .

Each new derivative of tan  looks completely different and cannot be written as a linear
combination of the previous derivatives. If we start differentiating tan , we get:

   sec2 , 2 sec2  tan , 4 sec2  tan2  + 2 sec4 ,
      8 sec2  tan3  + 16 sec4  tan , 16 sec2  tan4  + 88 sec4  tan2  + 16 sec6 , . . .
108                                                    CHAPTER 2. HIGHER-ORDER LINEAR ODES

    This equation calls for a different method. We present the method of variation of
parameters, which handles any equation of the form  =  (), provided we can solve

certain integrals. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to second-order constant-coefficient

equations, but the method works for higher-order equations just as well (the computations

become more tedious). The method also works for equations with nonconstant coefficients,

provided we can solve the associated homogeneous equation.
    The details below will work for any equation of the form  + () + () =  (),

but perhaps it is best to explain the method with a specific example. Consider the equation

                                            =  +  = tan .

First we find the complementary solution (solution to  = 0). We get  = 11 + 22,
where 1 = cos  and 2 = sin . To find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous

equation, the trick to this method is to try

                                            =  = 1 1 + 2 2,

where 1 and 2 are functions and not constants. We are trying to satisfy  = tan . That
gives us one condition on the functions 1 and 2. Compute (note the product rule!)

                                   = (1 1 + 2 2) + (1 1 + 2 2 ).

We can still impose one more condition at our discretion to simplify computations (we

have two unknown functions, so we should be allowed two conditions). We require that
11 + 22 = 0 (the first term above). This makes computing the second derivative easier:

                                   = 1 1 + 2 2 ,
                                   = (1 1 + 2 2) + (1 1 + 2 2 ).

Since  1   and  2   are  solutions  to     +    =  0,  we  find        =  -1  and       =  -2.  (If  the  equation

                                                                    1                2
where the more general  + () + () = 0, we would have  = -() - ().) So

                                        =  (      +   )    -   (1 1    +  2 2).

                                              11       22

We have 11 + 22 =  and so

                                            = (1 1 + 2 2) - ,

and hence

                                         +  =  = 1 1 + 2 2.

For    to  satisfy       =   (),  we  must    have    ()   =           + 2 2.

                                                                 11
What we need to solve are the two equations (conditions) we imposed on 1 and 2:

                                            1 1 + 2 2 = 0,

                                            1 1      +         =   ().

                                                           22
2.5. NONHOMOGENEOUS EQUATIONS                                                                                             109

We get these same equations for any  =  (), where  =  + () + (). We solve

for       and       in   terms     of   (),   1,   and     2.    There   is  a  general      formula  for  the  solution  we

       1         2

could just plug into, but instead of memorizing that, it is easier to simply solve it as we do

below. In our case, 1 = cos , 2 = sin , and  () = tan , so the two equations are

                                               1 cos  + 2 sin  = 0,

                                              -       sin     +  2  cos    =    tan  .

                                                   1

Multiply the first equation by sin  and the second by cos :

                                   1 cos  sin  + 2 sin2  = 0,

                              -        sin    cos     +    2  cos2    =  tan      cos     =  sin  .

                                   1

Add the two equations to eliminate 1, solve for 2, and then solve for 1:

                                              2 sin2  + cos2  = sin ,
                                              2 = sin ,

                                              1 = - sin cos  = cos 2   - sec .

We   integrate           and       to  get  1  and    2.

                      1         2

                                            

                    1 = 1  = (cos  - sec )  = sin  - ln |sec  + tan | ,
                                            

                    2 = 2  = sin   = - cos .

We are looking for a particular solution, so we forget about the constants of integration. So
our particular solution is

   = 11 + 22 = cos  sin  - cos  ln|sec  + tan | - cos  sin 
                                                                                 = - cos  ln|sec  + tan |.

The general solution to  +  = tan  is, therefore,

                             = 1 cos  + 2 sin  - cos  ln|sec  + tan |.

     So the general idea for any  +   +   =  () is to first find solutions 1, 2 to
 +   +   = 0.                                                                                            2,
                              Then     solve   the       two     boxed   equations        for       and       that  is,  solve
                                                                                                 1
1 1 + 2 2      =    0 and       +              =       ().    Integrate           and        to find  1  and  2,  and plug

                                11 22                                          1          2
those into  = 11 + 22 to find the particular solution. We remark that if  has some
coefficient that is not 1, that is, if the equation is   +   +   =  (), you must first divide

the equation (and hence  ) by .

2.6 Forced oscillations and resonance

Note: 2 lectures, §3.6 in [EP], §3.8 in [BD]                              ()

    Let us return back to the example of a mass on a spring.            
We examine the case of forced oscillations, which we did not
yet handle. That is, we consider the equation                                            

                          +  +  = (),                         damping 

for some nonzero (). The setup is again:  is position,  is mass,  is friction,  is the
spring constant, and () is an external force acting on the mass.

    We are interested in periodic forcing, such as noncentered rotating parts, or perhaps

loud sounds, or other sources of periodic force. Using Fourier series, see chapter 4, we note
that we can understand all periodic functions by considering () = 0 cos() (or sine
instead of cosine, the calculations are essentially the same), so we focus on this simple case.

2.6.1 Undamped forced motion and resonance

First, let us consider undamped ( = 0) motion. We have the equation
                                             +  = 0 cos().

This equation has the complementary solution (solution to the associated homogeneous

equation)

                          = 1 cos(0) + 2 sin(0),

where 0 = / is the natural frequency (angular). It is the frequency at which the system

"wants to oscillate" without external interference.

    Suppose that 0  . We solve using the method of undetermined coefficients. We try
the solution  =  cos() and solve for . We do not need a sine in our trial solution as

after plugging in we only have cosines. If you include a sine, it is fine; you will find that its

coefficient is zero (I could not find a second rhyme). We plug into the equation and solve

for  to find              = 20 cos().
                                (0 - 2)

We leave it as an exercise to do the algebra required.

The general solution is

               = 1 cos(0) + 2 sin(0) + 20 cos().
                                                        (0 - 2)

Written another way
                                =  cos(0 - ) + 20 cos().
                                                            (0 - 2)

The solution is a superposition of two (shifted) cosine waves at different frequencies.
112                                              CHAPTER 2. HIGHER-ORDER LINEAR ODES

Example 2.6.1: Take

                       0.5 + 8 = 10 cos(), (0) = 0, (0) = 0.

    Let us compute. First we read off the parameters:  = , 0 = 8/0.5 = 4, 0 = 10,
 = 0.5. The general solution is

                              = 1 cos(4) + 2 sin(4) + 16 - 2 20 cos().
    Solve for 1 and 2 using the initial
conditions: 1 = 16-2 -20 and 2 = 0. Hence 10 0 5 10 15 20 10

         = 16 - 2 20 cos() - cos(4) . 5 5

The function  is a high-frequency wave modulated by a low-frequency wave.

    Now suppose 0 = . We notice that cos() solves the associated homogeneous
equation. Hence, we cannot try the solution  cos() with the method of undetermined

coefficients. Therefore, we try  =  cos() +  sin(). This time we do need the sine

term, since the second derivative of  cos() contains sines. We write the equation

                                         + 2 = 0  cos().

Plugging  into the left-hand side, we get

                             2 cos() - 2 sin() = 0  cos().

Hence     =  0  and    =   0    Our  particular  solution          is   0      sin()    and   the  general  solution
                                                                       2

is  =   1 cos() + 2 sin() + 0  sin().

The important term is the last one (the particular solution we found). This term grows
                                                                        0               -0

By forcing the system at just the right fre-        0       5        10            15      20

when as a kid you could start swinging by     0.0                                              0.0

ings collapse while others may be relatively

undamaged. This is due to different buildings having different resonance frequencies. So

figuring out the resonance frequency can be very important.

A common (but wrong) example of the destructive force of resonance is the Tacoma

Narrows bridge failure. It turns out there was a different phenomenon at play.

2.6.2 Damped forced motion and practical resonance

In real life, things are not as simple as they were above. There is, of course, some damping.

Our equation becomes

                       +  +  = 0 cos(),                                                    (2.8)

for some  > 0. We solved the homogeneous problem before. We let

                      =  ,                    0 =        .
                           2
                                                       

We replace equation (2.8) with
                                        + 2 + 02 = 0  cos().

The roots of the characteristic equation of the associated homogeneous problem are

1, 2 = - ± 2 - 20. The form of the general solution of the associated homogeneous

equation depends on the sign of 2 - 20, or equivalently on the sign of 2 - 4, as before:

      11 + 22                                                  if 2 > 4,
                                                               if 2 = 4,

where 1 = 20 - 2. In any case, we see that ()  0 as   .

    Let us find a particular solution. There can be no conflicts when trying to solve for the
undetermined coefficients by trying  =  cos() +  sin(). We plug in and solve for
 and . We get (the tedious details are left to reader)

         (02 - 2) - 2 sin() + (02 - 2) + 2 cos() = 0  cos().

    We solve for  and  as usual:

             =              (20 - 2)0        ,         = 2 2 2 20 .
                                                           (2) + (0 - 2)
                     (2) + (0 - 2)2    2    2

Thus our particular solution is

          =             (20 - 2)0 2 cos() +                  2  0    2 sin().

             (2)2 + (20 - 2)                          (2)2 + (20 - 2)

                        

The amplitude  = 2 + 2 of this solution is

                                   =                 0 .
                                            (2)2 + (20 - 2)2

Let us write the solution in the alternative form  =  cos( - ) for amplitude  and
phase shift  where (if   0)

                                       tan  =  = 20 - 2 2 .

Hence,

                               =                0 cos( - ).
                                       (2)2 + (20 - 2)2

If    =  0,  then    =  0,    =    =     0  and    =  /2.

                                       2 ,

    For reasons we will explain in a moment, we call  the transient solution and denote it
by . We call  the steady periodic solution and denote it by . The general solution is

                                        =  +  =  + .

    The transient solution  =  goes to zero as   , as all the terms involve an
exponential with a negative exponent. So for large , the effect of  is negligible and we
see essentially only . Hence the name transient. Notice that  involves no arbitrary
constants, and the initial conditions only affect . Thus, the effect of the initial conditions

is negligible after some period of time. We might as well focus on the steady periodic

solution and ignore the transient solution. See Figure 2.7 on the next page for a graph

given several different initial conditions.

How fast  goes to zero depends on                           0       5              10  15  20

furthest the mass goes either way from the

rest position. We plot  as a function of  (fix all other parameters) and we find its

maximum. The  that gives this maximum is the practical resonance frequency. The maximal
amplitude () is the practical resonance amplitude. Thus when damping is present we talk

of practical resonance rather than pure resonance. Figure 2.8 shows a sample plot for three
different values of . Notice that the practical resonance amplitude grows as damping gets

smaller, and practical resonance can disappear altogether when damping is large.

This is zero either when  = 0 or when 22 + 2 - 20 = 0. In other words, () = 0 when

      = 20 - 22 or  = 0.

If 20 - 22 is positive, then 20 - 22 is the practical resonance frequency (the point where
() is maximal). This conclusion follows by the first derivative test, for example, as then
() > 0 for small  in this case. If on the other hand 20 - 22 is not positive, then ()
achieves its maximum at  = 0, and there is no practical resonance since we assume  > 0

in our system. In this case, the amplitude gets larger as the forcing frequency gets smaller.
    If practical resonance occurs, the frequency is smaller than 0. As the damping  (and

hence ) becomes smaller, the practical resonance frequency goes to 0. So when damping
is very small, 0 is a good estimate of the practical resonance frequency. This behavior
agrees with the observation that when  = 0, then 0 is the resonance frequency.

    Another interesting observation to make is that when   , then   0. This means

that if the forcing frequency gets too high it does not manage to get the mass moving in

the mass-spring system. This is quite reasonable intuitively. If we wiggle back and forth

really fast while sitting on a swing, we will not get it moving at all, no matter how forceful.

Fast vibrations just cancel each other out before the mass has any chance of responding by

moving one way or the other.

    The behavior is more complicated if the forcing function is not an exact cosine wave,

but for example a square wave. A general periodic function will be the sum (superposition)

of many cosine waves of different frequencies. The reader is encouraged to come back to

this section once we have learned about the Fourier series.

Exercise 2.6.5: A water tower in an earthquake acts as a mass-spring system. Assume that the
container on top is full and the water does not move around. The container then acts as the mass
and the support acts as the spring, where the induced vibrations are horizontal. The container with
water has a mass of  = 10, 000 kg. It takes a force of 1000 newtons to displace the container 1
meter. For simplicity, assume no friction. When the earthquake hits, the water tower is at rest (it is
not moving). The earthquake induces an external force () = 2 cos() newtons.

3.1 Introduction to systems of ODEs

Note: 1 to 1.5 lectures, §4.1 in [EP], §7.1 in [BD]

3.1.1 Systems

Often we do not have just one dependent variable and one equation. We will see that we

may end up with a system of several equations and several dependent variables even if we

start with a single equation.

Given several dependent variables, suppose 1, 2, . . . , , we can have a differential

equation involving all of them and their derivatives with respect to one independent

variable  .  For  example,       =    (     ,       ,  1  ,  2  ,  ).  Usually,  when  we  have  two  dependent

                              1          1       2

variables, we have two equations such as

                                           1 = 1(1 , 2 , 1, 2, ),
                                           2 = 2(1 , 2 , 1, 2, ),

for some known functions 1 and 2. We call the above a system of differential equations. More
precisely, the above is a second-order system of ODEs as second-order derivatives appear.
The system

                                              1 = 1(1, 2, 3, ),
                                              2 = 2(1, 2, 3, ),
                                              3 = 3(1, 2, 3, ),

is a first-order system, where 1, 2, 3 are the dependent variables, and  is the independent
variable.

    The terminology for systems is essentially the same as for single equations. For the
120                                                                 CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

system above, a solution is a set of three functions 1(), 2(), 3(), such that

                                       1 () = 1 1(), 2(), 3(),  ,
                                       2 () = 2 1(), 2(), 3(),  ,
                                       3 () = 3 1(), 2(), 3(),  .
    We may also have an initial condition. As for single equations, we specify 1, 2, and 3
for some fixed . For example, 1(0) = 1, 2(0) = 2, 3(0) = 3, where 1, 2, and 3 are
some constants. For a second-order system, we must also specify the first derivatives at

the initial point. If we find a solution with arbitrary constants in it, where solving for the

constants gives a solution for any initial condition, we call this solution the general solution.

Best to look at a simple example.

Example 3.1.1: Sometimes a system is easy to solve by solving for one variable and then
for the second variable. Take the first-order system

                                                   1 = 1,
                                                   2 = 1 - 2,

with 1, 2 as the dependent variables and  as the independent variable. Consider initial

conditions 1(0) = 1, 2(0) = 2.
     We note that 1 = 1 is the general solution of the first equation. We then plug this 1
                                                                    1  
into  the  second   equation  and     get  the  equation         =       -  2,  which  is  a  linear  first-order
                                                              2
equation that is easily solved for 2. By the integrating factor method, we get

                                             2 = 1 2 + 2,
                                                      2

or 2 = 21  + 2-. The general solution to the system is, therefore,

                                      1 = 1 ,            2 = 1  + 2-.
                                                                2

We solve for 1 and 2 given the initial conditions. We substitute  = 0 to find 1 = 1(0) = 1
and 2 = 2(0) = 1/2 + 2, or in other words, 1 = 1 and 2 = 3/2. Thus the solution is
1 =  , and 2 = (1/2)  + (3/2)-.

     Generally, we will not be so lucky to be able to solve for each variable separately as in

the example--we will need to solve for all variables at once. While we cannot always solve

one variable at a time, we will try to salvage as much as possible from this technique. In a

certain sense, to solve systems, we will still (try to) solve a bunch of single equations and

put their solutions together. Let us not worry right now about how to solve systems yet.

     We will mostly consider linear systems. Example 3.1.1 is a linear first-order system. It is

linear as none of the dependent variables or their derivatives appear in nonlinear functions

or with powers higher than one (1, 2, 1, 2, constants, and functions of  can appear,
           1 2      ( )2       31 ).
but  not        or        or          Another,  more     complicated,  example  of  a  linear  (second-order)
                       2

system is                             1 =   1 + 2 1 + 52 + sin(),

                                      2  =         -  2  +  21   +  cos().

3.1.2 Applications

We consider some simple applications of systems and how to set up the equations.

Example 3.1.2: First, we consider salt and brine tanks, but this time water flows from one
to the other and back. Imagine we have two tanks, each containing volume  liters of salt
brine. The amount of salt in the first tank is 1 grams, and the amount of salt in the second
tank is 2 grams. Let  denote time--the independent variable. The liquid in each tank is
being constantly and perfectly mixed and flows or is pumped at a rate of  liters per second
out of each tank into the other. See Figure 3.1.

                                            1                                 2
                                        Vol. =                        Vol. = 

                                     Figure 3.1: A closed system of two brine tanks.

    The rate of change of 1, that is, 1, is the rate of salt entering minus the rate leaving.
The density of the salt in tank 2 is 2/, so the rate of salt entering tank 1 is 2/ times . The
density of the salt in tank 1 is 1/, so the rate of salt leaving tank 1 is 1/ times . In other

words,                           1 = 2   - 1   =  2 -  1 =  (2 - 1).

Similarly, to find the rate 2, the roles of 1 and 2 are reversed. All in all, the system of

ODEs for this problem is                             1 =  (2 - 1),
                                                     2 =  (1 - 2).

                                                           

In this system, we cannot solve for 1 or 2 separately. We must solve for both 1 and 2 at

once, which is intuitively clear--the amount of salt in one tank affects the amount in the
other. We cannot know 1 before we know 2, and vice versa.

     We do not yet know how to find all the solutions, but intuitively we can at least find

some solutions. Suppose we know that initially the tanks have the same amount of salt.
That is, we have an initial condition such as 1(0) = 2(0) = . Then clearly the amount

of salt entering and leaving each tank is the same, so the amounts are not changing. In

other     words,    1    =       and    2   =     (the  constant  functions)     is  a  solution:       =       =  0,  and

  (       -  1)  =    (       -  2)  =                                                               1       2
                    
       2                   1            0,  so  the  equations  are  satisfied.
122                                                                     CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

    Let us think about the setup a little bit more without solving it. Suppose the initial

conditions are 1(0) =  and 2(0) = , for two different constants  and . Since no salt is
coming in or out of this closed system, the total amount of salt is constant. That is, 1 + 2
is constant, and so it equals  + . Intuitively, if  > , more salt will flow out of tank one

than into it. After a long time, we then expect the amount of salt in each tank to equalize.
                                                                                          +
In  other  words,  the  solutions  of  both  1  and  2    should        tend     towards    2  as    goes  to  .

Once you know how to solve systems, you can check that this really is so.

Example 3.1.3: Let us look at a second-order example. We return to the mass and spring

setup, but this time we consider two masses.

    Consider one spring with constant  and two masses 1                                        

and 2. Think of the masses as carts on a straight track with 1                                       2
no friction. Let 1 be the displacement of the first cart and

2 be the displacement of the second cart. That is, we put 1 2
the two carts somewhere with no tension on the spring, we

mark the position of the first and second cart, and we call those the zero positions. Then
1 measures how far the first cart is from its zero position, and 2 measures how far the

second cart is from its zero position. The force exerted by the spring on the first cart is
(2 - 1) as 2 - 1 is how far the spring is stretched (or compressed) from the rest position.

The force exerted on the second cart is the opposite, thus the same thing with a negative

sign. Newton's second law states that force equals mass times acceleration, that is,

                                              11 = (2 - 1),
                                              22 = -(2 - 1).

    Again, we cannot solve for the 1 or 2 variables one at a time. Where the first cart goes
depends on exactly where the second cart goes and vice versa.

3.1.3 Changing to first-order systems

To some degree, we need only be able to solve first-order systems. Consider an th-order

differential equation              () = ((-1), . . . , , , ).

We define new variables 1, 2, . . . ,  and write the system

                                   1 = 2,
                                   2 = 3,

                                       ..
                                       .

                        -1  =  ,

                                       =  ( ,    -1 ,  .  .  .  ,  2 ,  1 ,  ).

                                   

We solve this system for 1, 2, . . . , . Once we have solved for the , we can discard 2
through  and let  = 1. This  solves the original equation.
3.1. INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEMS OF ODES                                                                123

Example 3.1.4: Take  = 2 + 8 +  + . Letting 1 = , 2 = , 3 = , we find the

system:

                           1 = 2, 2 = 3, 3 = 23 + 82 + 1 + .

Note why  = 1 solves the original equation: The first two equations of the system give
                              .                        ,                 ,             
that       =       =       =     If  we  plug       =     1  =  ,  2  =     and  3  =    into  the  third
        3       2       1                        3

equation of the system, we recover the third-order equation we started with.

    The same idea works for a system of higher-order differential equations. A system of 
differential equations in  unknowns, all of order , can be transformed into a first-order
system of  ×  equations and  ×  unknowns.

Example 3.1.5: Consider the system from the example with carts, Example 3.1.3:

                              11 = (2 - 1), 22 = -(2 - 1).
Let 1 = 1, 2 = 1, 3 = 2, 4 = 2. The second-order system becomes the first-order
system

              1 = 2, 12 = (3 - 1), 3 = 4, 24 = -(3 - 1).

Example 3.1.6: The idea works in reverse as well. Suppose we want to solve the system

                                          = 2 - ,  = ,

for the initial conditions (0) = 1, (0) = 0. Let the independent variable be .
    If we differentiate the second equation, we get  = . We know what  is in terms of

 and , and we know that  = . So,

                                          =  = 2 -  = 2 - .

We now have the equation  +  - 2 = 0. We know how to solve this equation and we
find that  = 1-2 + 2. Once we have , we use the equation  =  to get .

                                           =  = -21-2 + 2 .

We solve for the initial conditions 1 = (0) = -21 + 2 and 0 = (0) = 1 + 2. Hence,
1 = -2 and 1 = 32. So 1 = -1/3 and 2 = 1/3. Our solution is

                                  = 2-2 +  ,              =     --2 +    .
                                            3
                                                                   3

Exercise 3.1.1: Plug in and check that this really is the solution.

    It is useful to go back and forth between systems and higher-order equations for other
reasons. For example, software for solving ODEs numerically (approximation) is generally
for first-order systems. To use it, you take whatever ODE you want to solve and convert
it to a first-order system. It is not very hard to adapt computer code for the Euler or
Runge-Kutta method for first-order equations to handle first-order systems. We simply
treat the dependent variable not as a number but as a vector. In many mathematical
computer languages there is almost no distinction in syntax.

3.1.4 Autonomous systems and vector fields

A system where the equations do not depend on the independent variable is called an
autonomous system. For example, the system  = 2 - ,  =  is autonomous as the
independent variable, say , does not appear in the equations.

    For autonomous systems, we can draw the so-called direction field or vector field, a plot

similar to a slope field, but instead of giving a slope at each point, we give a direction (and
a magnitude). The previous example,  = 2 - ,  = , says that at the point (, ) the

direction in which we should travel to satisfy the equations should be the direction of the
vector (2 - , ) with the speed equal to the magnitude of this vector. So we draw the
vector (2 - , ) at the point (, ) and we do this for many points on the -plane. For
example, at the point (1, 2), we draw the vector 2(2) - 1, 1 = (3, 1), a vector pointing to
the right and a little bit up, while at the point (2, 1) we draw the vector 2(1) - 2, 2 = (0, 2)

a vector that points straight up. When drawing the vectors, we will scale down their

size to fit many of them on the same direction field. If we drew the arrows at the actual

size, the diagram would be a jumbled mess once we draw more than a couple of arrows.

So we scale them all so that not even the longest one interferes with the others. We are

mostly interested in their direction and relative size. See Figure 3.2 on the facing page. The

diagrams we drew in § 1.6 for autonomous equations in one dimension are similar, but

note how much more complicated things become when we allow just one extra dimension.

    We can draw a path of the solution in the plane. Suppose the solution is given by
 =  (),  = (). We pick an interval of  (say 0    2 for our example) and plot all
the points  (), () for  in the selected range. The resulting picture is called the phase

portrait (or phase plane portrait). The particular curve obtained is called the trajectory or

solution curve. See an example plot in Figure 3.3 on the next page. In the figure the solution
starts at (1, 0) and travels along the vector field for a distance of 2 units of . We solved this
system precisely, so we compute (2) and (2) to find (2)  2.475 and (2)  2.457. This

point corresponds to the top right end of the plotted solution curve in the figure.
    We can draw phase portraits and trajectories in the -plane even if the system is not

autonomous. In this case, however, we cannot draw the direction field, since the field
changes as  changes. For each  we would get a different direction field.

3.1.5 Picard's theorem

Before going further, we mention that Picard's theorem on existence and uniqueness also

holds for systems of ODEs. Let us restate this theorem in this setting. A general first-order

system is of the form

                        1 = 1(1, 2, . . . ,  , ),            (3.1)
                        2 = 2(1, 2, . . . ,  , ),

                          ..
                          .

                            =   (1 ,  2,  .  .  .  ,  ,  ).

Theorem 3.1.1 (Picard's theorem on existence and uniqueness for systems). If for every

continuous  near     some                                        0),  then   a  solution      to  (3.1)       subject  to  the  initial  condition

unique.

    That is, a unique solution exists for any initial condition given that the system is
reasonable (each  and its partial derivatives in the  variables are continuous). As for
single equations, we may not have a solution for all time , but it is guaranteed at least for

some short period of time.
    As we can change any th-order ODE into a first-order system, this theorem also

provides the existence and uniqueness of solutions for higher-order equations.

3.2 Matrices and linear systems

Note: 1.5 lectures, first part of §5.1 in [EP], §7.2 and §7.3 in [BD], see also appendix A

3.2.1 Matrices and vectors

Before we start talking about linear systems of ODEs, we need to talk about matrices, so let
us review these briefly. A matrix is an  ×  array of numbers ( rows and  columns).
For example, we denote a 3 × 5 matrix as follows

                                           11 12 13 14 15
                                      = 21 22 23 24 25 .

                                           31 32 33 34 35
The numbers  are called elements or entries. We say a matrix is square if it has  = , that

is, it has the same number of rows and columns.
    In the setting of matrices, by a vector, we usually mean a column vector, that is, an  × 1

matrix. If we mean a row vector, we will explicitly say so (a row vector is a 1 ×  matrix).

We usually denote matrices by upper case letters and vectors by lower case letters with an
arrow such as ì or ì. We write 0ì for a vector of all zeros.

    We define some operations on matrices. We want 1 × 1 matrices to really act like

numbers, so our operations have to be compatible with this viewpoint. First, we can

multiply a matrix by a scalar (a number). We simply multiply each entry in the matrix by

the scalar. For example,

                                         21 2 3 = 2 4 6 .
                                             4 5 6 8 10 12

Matrix addition is also simple. We add matrices element by element. For example,

1 2 3 + 1 1 -1 = 2 3 2 .
456 02 4                          4 7 10

If the sizes do not match, then addition is not defined. If we denote by 0 the matrix with all
zero entries, by ,  scalars, and by , ,  matrices, we have the following familiar rules:

         + 0 =  = 0 + ,
        +  =  + ,
( + ) +  =  + ( + ),
    ( + ) =  + ,
    ( + ) =  + .

    Another useful operation for matrices is the so-called transpose. This operation just
swaps rows and columns of a matrix. The transpose of  is denoted by . Example:

                            1 2 3   = 1 4 2 5
                            456   
                                  3 6
128                                           CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

3.2.2 Matrix multiplication

Matrix multiplication is a bit more complicated. First we define the so-called dot product (or

inner product) of two vectors. Usually this will be a row vector multiplied with a column

vector of the same size. For the dot product, we multiply each pair of entries from the first

and the second vector, and we sum these products. The result is a single number. For

example,                                  1
                                          
                          1 2 3 · 2 = 11 + 22 + 33.
                                          3

Similarly for larger (or smaller) vectors.
    Armed with the dot product, we define the product of matrices. We denote by row()

the th row of  and by column() the th column of . For an  ×  matrix  and an
 ×  matrix , we can define the product . We let  be an  ×  matrix whose th

entry is the dot product

                          row() · column().

Do note how the sizes match up:  ×  multiplied by  ×  is  × . Example:

1 2 3 1 0 -1 1 1 1  =     1·0+2·1+3·0  1 · (-1) + 2 · 1 + 3 · 0 = 6 2 1
4 5 6   1 0 0             4·0+5·1+6·0  4 · (-1) + 5 · 1 + 6 · 0 15 5 1

      = 1·1+2·1+3·1
           4·1+5·1+6·1

For multiplication, we want an analogue of a 1. This analogue is the so-called identity

matrix. The identity matrix is a square matrix with 1s on the diagonal and zeros everywhere

else. It is usually denoted by . For each size, we have a different identity matrix. So

sometimes we may denote the size as a subscript. For example, 3 would be the 3 × 3

identity matrix                        1 0 0
                              = 3 = 0 1 0 .

                                       0 0 1

We have the following rules for matrix multiplication. Suppose that , ,  are matrices

of the correct sizes so that the following make sense. Let  denote a scalar (number). Then,

                             () = (),
                          ( + ) =  + ,
                          ( + ) =  + ,

                             () = () = (),
                                   =  = .
3.2. MATRICES AND LINEAR SYSTEMS                                                 129

A few warnings are in order.

(i)    in general (it may be true by fluke sometimes). That is, matrices do not

commute. For example, take  =      11  and  =  10 .
                                   11
                                               02

(ii)  =  does not necessarily imply  = , even if  is not 0.

(iii)  = 0 does not necessarily mean that  = 0 or  = 0. Try, for example,  =  =  01 .

                                                                                 00

    For the last two items to hold, we would need to "divide" by a matrix. This is where
the matrix inverse comes in. Suppose that  and  are  ×  matrices such that

                                    =  = .

Then we call  the inverse of  and we denote  by -1. If the inverse of  exists, then we

call  invertible. If  is not invertible, we sometimes say  is singular.

    If  is invertible, then  =  does imply that  =  (in particular, the inverse of
 is unique). We just multiply both sides by -1 (on the left) to get -1 = -1 or
 =  or  = . It is also not hard to see that (-1)-1 = .

3.2.3 The determinant

For square matrices we define a useful quantity called the determinant. We define the
determinant of a 1 × 1 matrix as the value of its only entry. For a 2 × 2 matrix, we define

                                     def
                              det      =  - .
                                   

    Before trying to define the determinant for larger matrices, let us note the meaning of
the determinant. Consider an  ×  matrix as a mapping of the -dimensional euclidean
space  to itself, where ì gets sent to ì. In particular, a 2 × 2 matrix  is a mapping
of the plane to itself. The determinant of  is the factor by which the area of objects
changes. If we take the unit square (square of side 1) in the plane, then  takes the square
to a parallelogram of area |det()|. The sign of det() denotes changing of orientation

(negative if the axes get flipped). For example, let

                                                  = 1 1 .
                                                         -1 1

Then det() = 1 + 1 = 2. Let us see where the (unit) square with vertices (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1),
and (1, 1) gets sent. Clearly (0, 0) gets sent to (0, 0).

 1 1 1= 1 ,                         1 1 0=1,          1 1 1=2.
-1 1 0 -1                          -1 1 1 1          -1 1 1 0

The image of the square is anothersquare with vertices (0, 0), (1, -1), (1, 1), and (2, 0). The
image square has a side of length 2 and is therefore of area 2.
130                                       CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

    If you think back to high school geometry, you may have seen a formula for computing
the area of a parallelogram with vertices (0, 0), (, ), (, ) and ( + ,  + ). And it is

precisely
                                                  det   .
                                                          

The vertical lines above mean absolute value. The matrix    carries the unit square to
                                                          

the given parallelogram.

    Let us look at the determinant for larger matrices. We define  as the matrix  with
the th row and the th column deleted. To compute the determinant of a matrix, pick one
row, say the th row and compute:

                                             

                           det() = (-1)+  det().

                                            =1

For the first row, we get

det() = 11 det(11) - 12 det(12) + 13 det(13) - · · ·      +1 det(1)  if  is odd,
                                                          -1 det(1)  if  even.

We alternately add and subtract the determinants of the submatrices  multiplied by
 for a fixed  and all . For a 3 × 3 matrix, picking the first row, we get det() =
11 det(11) - 12 det(12) + 13 det(13). For example,

     1 2 3 5 6 4 6 4 5
     det 4 5 6 = 1 · det   89  - 2 · det  79              + 3 · det  78
          
     7 8 9

                           = 1(5 · 9 - 6 · 8) - 2(4 · 9 - 6 · 7) + 3(4 · 8 - 5 · 7) = 0.

    The numbers (-1)+ det() are called cofactors of the matrix and this way of computing
the determinant is called the cofactor expansion. No matter which row you pick, you always
get the same number. It is also possible to compute the determinant by expanding along
columns (picking a column instead of a row above). It is true that det() = det().

    A common notation for the determinant is a pair of vertical lines:

                             = det   .
                               

I personally find this notation confusing as vertical lines usually mean a positive quantity,
while determinants can be negative. Also think about how to write the absolute value of a
determinant. I will not use this notation in this book.
3.2. MATRICES AND LINEAR SYSTEMS                                                                    131

    Think of the determinants telling you the scaling of a mapping. If  doubles the sizes
of geometric objects and  triples them, then  (which applies  to an object and then )
should make size go up by a factor of 6 = 3 · 2. This is true in general:

                                          det() = det() det().

This property is one of the most useful, and it can be employed to actually compute

determinants. A particularly interesting consequence is to note what it means for existence
of inverses. Take  and  to be inverses of each other, that is,  = . Then

                              det() det() = det() = det() = 1.

Neither det() nor det() can be zero. Conversely, if det() is not zero, then  is invertible.
We state this observation as a theorem as it is very important in the context of this course.

Theorem 3.2.1. An  ×  matrix  is invertible if and only if det()  0.

    In fact, det(-1) det() = 1 says that det(-1) = det(1) . So we even know what the
determinant of -1 is before we know how to compute -1.

    There is a simple formula for the inverse of a 2 × 2 matrix

                                     -1 1                         - .
                                             =
                                                   -  - 

Notice  the  determinant  of  the  matrix  [      ]  in  the  denominator  of  the  fraction.  The  formula
                                                

only works if the determinant is nonzero, otherwise we are dividing by zero.

3.2.4 Solving linear systems

One application of matrices we will need is to solve systems of linear equations. This is
best shown by example. Suppose that we have the following system of linear equations

                                   21 + 22 + 23 = 2,
                                    1 + 2 + 33 = 5,
                                    1 + 42 + 3 = 10.

    Without changing the solution, we could swap equations in this system, we could
multiply any of the equations by a nonzero number, and we could add a multiple of one
equation to another equation. It turns out these operations always suffice to find a solution.

    It is easier to write the system as a matrix equation. The system above can be written as

                                   2 2 2 1                       2
                                   1       1      3  2                  .
                                                              =    5  

                                   1 4 1 3 10
132                                                      CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

To solve the system, we put the coefficient matrix (the matrix on the left-hand side of the

equation) together with the vector on the right-hand side and get the so-called augmented

matrix:                                             
                                                    
                      2    2              2      2  
                                                    
                      1    1              3      5    .

                      1    4              1  10     
                                                    

We apply a sequence of the following three elementary row operations.

(i) Swap two rows.

(ii) Multiply a row by a nonzero number.

(iii) Add a multiple of one row to another row.

We keep doing these operations until we get into a state where it is easy to read off the
answer, or until we get into a contradiction indicating no solution, for example if we come
up with an equation such as 0 = 1.

    Let us work through the example. First multiply the first row by 1/2 to obtain

                      1    1              1      1  
                                                    
                      1    1              3      5    .

                      1    4              1  10     
                                                    

Now subtract the first row from the second and third row:

                        1  1              1      1  
                                                    
                        0  0              2      4
                                                    
                        0  3              0      9  

Multiply the last row by 1/3 and the second row by 1/2:

                        1  1              1      1  
                                                    
                        0  0              1      2
                                                    
                        0  1              0      3  

Swap rows 2 and 3:                                  
                                                    
                        1  1              1      1  
                                                    
                        0  1              0      3  
                                                    
                        0  0              1      2

Subtract the last row from the first, then subtract the second row from the first:

                        1  0              0  -4     
                                                    
                        0  1              0      3
                                                    
                        0  0              1      2  

Finally, we think about what equations this augmented matrix represents: 1 = -4, 2 = 3,
and 3 = 2. We try this solution in the original system and, voilà, it works!
3.2. MATRICES AND LINEAR SYSTEMS                                                  133

Exercise 3.2.1: Check that the solution above really solves the given equations.

We write this equation in matrix notation as

                                         ì = ì,

                  222 ì 2
where  is the matrix 1 1 3 and  is the vector 5 . The solution can also be computed
                  141                               10
via the inverse,
                                  ì = -1ì = -1ì.

    It is possible that the solution is not unique, or that no solution exists. It is easy to tell if
a solution does not exist. If during the row reduction you come up with a row where all the
entries except the last one are zero (the last entry in a row corresponds to the right-hand
side of the equation), then the system is inconsistent and has no solution. For example, for
a system of 3 equations and 3 unknowns, if you find a row such as [ 0 0 0 | 1 ] in the
augmented matrix, you know the system is inconsistent. That row corresponds to 0 = 1.

    You generally try to use row operations until the following conditions are satisfied. The
first (from the left) nonzero entry in each row is called the leading entry.

(i) The leading entry in any row is strictly to the right of the leading entry of the row
    above.

(ii) Any zero rows are below all the nonzero rows.

(iii) All leading entries are 1.

(iv) All the entries above and below a leading entry are zero.

Such a matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form. The variables corresponding to
columns with no leading entries are said to be free variables. Free variables mean that we can
pick those variables to be anything we want and then solve for the rest of the unknowns.

Example 3.2.1: The following augmented matrix is in reduced row echelon form.

                                      1  2  0    3  
                                                    
                                      0  0  1    1
                                                    
                                      0  0  0    0  

Suppose the variables are 1, 2, and 3. Then 2 is the free variable, 1 = 3 - 22, and
3 = 1.

On the other hand, if during the row reduction process you come up with the matrix

                                    1    2  13   3  
                                                    
                                    0    0  1    1      ,

                                    0    0  0    3  
                                                    

there is no need to go further. The last row corresponds to the equation 01 + 02 + 03 = 3,

which is preposterous. Hence, no solution exists.

3.2.5 Computing the inverse

If the matrix  is square and there exists a unique solution ì to ì = ì for any ì (there are
no free variables), then  is invertible. Multiplying both sides by -1, you can see that
ì = -1ì. So it is useful to compute the inverse if you want to solve the equation for many
different right-hand sides ì.

    We have a formula for the 2 × 2 inverse, but it is also not hard to compute inverses of

larger matrices. While we will not have too much occasion to compute inverses for larger
matrices than 2 × 2 by hand, let us touch on how to do it. Finding the inverse of  is
actually just solving a bunch of linear equations. If we can solve ì = ì where ì is the
vector with all zeros except a 1 at the th position, then the inverse is the matrix with the
columns ì for  = 1, 2, . . . ,  (exercise: why?). Therefore, to find the inverse we write a
larger  × 2 augmented matrix [  |  ], where  is the identity matrix. We then perform
row reduction. The reduced row echelon form of [  |  ] will be of the form [  | -1 ] if
and only if  is invertible. We then just read off the inverse -1.

3.3 Linear systems of ODEs

Note: less than 1 lecture, second part of §5.1 in [EP], §7.4 in [BD]

    A matrix- or vector-valued function is simply a matrix or a vector whose entries depend
on some variable. If  is the independent variable, we write a vector-valued function ì() as

                                                  1()
                                                  
                                                  2()
                                          ì()  =     ..    .
                                                  .      

                                                    ( )

Similarly a matrix-valued function () is

                                     11() 12() · · · 1()             

                           ()        21() 22() · · · 2()..             .
                               =                   .. . .        ..  
                                     .            .        . .

                                     1() 2() · · · ()

The  derivative  ()  or    is  just  the  matrix-valued    function  whose   th  entry  is     ( ).
                         

    Rules of differentiation of matrix-valued functions are similar to rules for normal
functions. Let () and () be matrix-valued functions. Let  be a scalar and  a constant

matrix. Then               () + ()  = () + (),

                               ()()  = ()() + ()(),

                                     ()  = (),

                               ()  = (),

                               ()   = () .

Note the order of the multiplication in the last two expressions.
    A first-order linear system of ODEs is a system that can be written as the vector equation

                                     ì() = ()ì() + ì(),

where () is a matrix-valued function, and ì() and ì() are vector-valued functions. We
will often suppress the dependence on  and only write ì = ì + ì. A solution of the
system is a vector-valued function ì satisfying the vector equation.

    For example, the equations

                                             1 = 21 +  2 + 2,
                                             2 = 1 - 2 +  ,

can be written as                     2                       2

                                     ì = 1    / -1   ì +  .   
3.3. LINEAR SYSTEMS OF ODES                                                           137

    We will mostly concentrate on equations that are not just linear, but are in fact constant-
coefficient equations. That is, the matrix  will be constant; it will not depend on .

    When ì = 0ì (the zero vector), we say the system is homogeneous. For homogeneous
linear systems, we have the principle of superposition, just like for single homogeneous
linear equations.

Theorem 3.3.1 (Superposition). Let ì = ì be a linear homogeneous system of ODEs. Suppose
that ì1, ì2, . . . , ì are  solutions of the equation and 1, 2, . . . ,  are any constants, then

                               ì = 1ì1 + 2ì2 + · · · +  ì ,                           (3.2)

is also a solution. Furthermore, if this is a system of  equations ( is  × ), and ì1, ì2, . . . , ì
are linearly independent, then every solution ì can be written as (3.2).

    Linear independence for vector-valued functions is the same idea as for normal functions.
The vector-valued functions ì1, ì2, . . . , ì are linearly independent when

                               1ì1 + 2ì2 + · · · +  ì = 0ì

has only the solution 1 = 2 = · · · =  = 0, where the equation must hold for all .

Example 3.3.1: ì1 =  2 , ì2 =   0  , ì3 =  -2  are linearly dependent because ì1 + ì3 =
                               1+           1
                     

ì2, and this holds for all . So 1 = 1, 2 = -1, and 3 = 1 above will work.

On the other hand, if we change the example slightly to ì1 =  2 , ì2 =     0  , ì3 =  -2 1 ,
                                                                           
                                                              

then the functions are linearly independent. First write 1ì1 + 2ì2 + 3ì3 = 0ì and note
that it has to hold for all . We get that

                     1ì1 + 2ì2 + 3ì3 = 1  = 2 - 32 0 . 1 + 2 + 3 0

In other words 12 - 32 = 0 and 1 + 2 + 3 = 0. If we set  = 0, then the second
equation becomes 3 = 0. But then the first equation becomes 12 = 0 for all  and so
1 = 0. Thus the second equation is just 2 = 0, which means 2 = 0. So 1 = 2 = 3 = 0 is
the only solution and ì1, ì2, and ì3 are linearly independent.

    The linear combination 1ì1 + 2ì2 + · · · +  ì could always be written as

                                   () ì,

where () is the matrix with columns ì1, ì2, . . . , ì, and ì is the column vector with entries
1, 2, . . . , . Assuming that ì1, ì2, . . . , ì are linearly independent, the matrix-valued
function () is called a fundamental matrix, or a fundamental matrix solution. Note that the
fundamental matrix is not unique; if you take any constant invertible  ×  matrix , then
() is another fundamental matrix.

    To solve nonhomogeneous first-order linear systems, we use the same technique as we

applied to solve single linear nonhomogeneous equations.
138                                                      CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

Theorem 3.3.2. Let ì = ì + ì be a linear system of ODEs. Suppose ì is one particular solution.
Then every solution can be written as

                                     ì = ì + ì ,

where ì is a solution to the associated homogeneous equation (ì = ì).

    The procedure for systems is the same as for single equations. We find a particular
solution to the nonhomogeneous equation, then we find the general solution to the
associated homogeneous equation, and finally we add the two together.

    Alright, suppose you have found the general solution of ì = ì + ì. Next suppose
you are given an initial condition of the form

                                         ì(0) = ì

for some fixed 0 and a constant vector ì. Let () be a fundamental matrix solution of
the associated homogeneous equation (i.e. columns of () are solutions). The general

solution can be written as

                            ì() = () ì + ì().

We are seeking a vector ì such that

                                         ì = ì(0) = (0) ì + ì(0).
In other words, we are solving for ì the nonhomogeneous system of linear equations

                            (0) ì = ì - ì(0).

Example 3.3.2: In Example 3.1.1 on page 120, we solved the system

                                     1 = 1,
                                     2 = 1 - 2,

with initial conditions 1(0) = 1, 2(0) = 2. Let us consider this problem in the language of
this section. The system is homogeneous, so ì() = 0ì. We write the system and the initial

conditions as

                            ì = 1 0 ì,             ì(0) = 1 .
                                   1 -1                      2

Ignoring the initial condition for a moment, the general solution is 1 = 1 and

2 = 21  + 2-. Letting 1 = 1 and 2 = 0, we obtain the solution ì() =       

                                                                       (1/2) . Letting

1 = 0 and 2 = 1, we obtain ì() =      0  . These two solutions are linearly independent,
                                      -
as can be seen by setting  = 0, and noting that the resulting constant vectors are linearly

independent. In matrix notation, a fundamental matrix solution is, therefore,

                                                   -0 .
                                     () = 1

To solve the initial value problem, we solve for ì in the equation

                                                       (0) ì = ì,

or in other words,

                                                   11 0 ì = 1      2       .

A single elementary row operation shows ì =                         1
                                                                   3/2

This new solution agrees with our previous solution from § 3.1.

3.4 Eigenvalue method

Note: 2 lectures, §5.2 in [EP], part of §7.3, §7.5, and §7.6 in [BD]

    In this section, we will learn how to solve linear homogeneous constant-coefficient
systems of ODEs by the eigenvalue method. Suppose we have such a system

                                  ì = ì,

where  is a constant square matrix. We wish to adapt the method for the single constant-
coefficient equation by trying the function  for an unknown constant . However, ì is a
vector. So we try ì = ì, where ì is an unknown constant vector. We plug this ì into the

equation to get                ì = ì .

                               ì   ì

We divide by  and notice that we are looking for a scalar  and a vector ì that satisfy the

equation

                               ì = ì.

   To solve this equation, we need a little bit more linear algebra, which we now review.

3.4.1 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix

Let  be a constant square matrix. Suppose  is a scalar and ì is a nonzero vector such that

                               ì = ì.

We call such a  an eigenvalue of , and we call ì a corresponding eigenvector.

Example 3.4.1: The matrix  21  has an eigenvalue  = 2 with a corresponding eigenvector
                           01

1    , because
0

                               2 1 1 = 2 =2 1 .
                               01 0 0         0

   Let us compute eigenvalues for any matrix. Rewrite the equation for an eigenvalue as

ì - ì = 0ì and thus as         ( - )ì = 0ì.

This equation has a nonzero solution ì if and only if  -  is not invertible. Were
 -  invertible, we could write ( - )-1( - )ì = ( - )-10ì, which implies ì = 0ì.
Therefore,  has the eigenvalue  if and only if  solves the equation

                               det( - ) = 0.

Consequently, we can find an eigenvalue of  without finding a corresponding eigenvector
at the same time. An eigenvector will have to be found later, once  is known.

    We write

     2 1 1 1 0 0                           2 -  1                                            1

                                             = (2 - ) (2 - )2 - 1 = -( - 1)( - 2)( - 3).

Setting this to zero, we find that the eigenvalues are  = 1,  = 2, and  = 3.

    For an  ×  matrix, the polynomial we get by computing det( - ) is of degree , and
hence in general, we have  eigenvalues. Some may be repeated, some may be complex.

    To find an eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue , we write

                                        ( - )ì = 0ì,

and solve for a nontrivial (nonzero) vector ì. If  is an eigenvalue, there will be at least one
free variable, and so for each distinct eigenvalue , we can always find an eigenvector.

                                                                        211

Example 3.4.3: Find an eigenvector of 1 2 0 corresponding to the eigenvalue  = 3.

                                                                        002

    We write

        ( - )ì =            2                1                                            =     1    -1  0       =  0ì.

To solve this system of linear equations, we write down the augmented matrix

                                     -1      1                                1     0  
                                                                                       
                                        1    -1                               0     0     ,

                                        0    0   -1                                 0  
                                                                                       

and we perform row operations (exercise: which ones?) until we get:

                                        1    -1  0                               0  
                                                                                    
                                        0    0   1                               0     .

The entries of ì have to satisfy the equations 1 - 2 = 0, 3 = 0, and 2 is a free variable.

We pick 2 to be arbitrary (but nonzero), we let 1 = 2, and of course 3 = 0. For example,

if we pick 2 = 1, then ì =  1
to  = 3:
                            1 . Let us verify that ì really is an eigenvector corresponding

                            0

                               2 1 1 1 3 1

                               0 0 2 0 0 0
                                                

Yay! It worked.

Exercise 3.4.1 (easy): Are eigenvectors unique? Can you find a different eigenvector for  = 3 in
the example above? How are the two eigenvectors related?

Exercise 3.4.2: When the matrix is 2 × 2 you do not need to do row operations when computing an

eigenvector, you can read it off from  -  (if you have computed the eigenvalues correctly). Can

you see why? Explain. Try it for the matrix    21 .

3.4.2 The eigenvalue method with distinct real eigenvalues

OK, back to homogeneous constant-coefficient systems of ODEs. We have the system
                                                     ì = ì.

We find the eigenvalues 1, 2, . . . ,  of the matrix , and corresponding eigenvectors ì1,
ì2, . . . , ì. The functions ì11, ì22, . . . , ì  are solutions of the system of equations
and hence ì = 1ì11 + 2ì22 + · · · + ì  is a solution.

Theorem 3.4.1. Take ì = ì. If  is an  ×  constant matrix that has  distinct real eigenvalues
1, 2, . . . , , then there exist  linearly independent corresponding eigenvectors ì1, ì2, . . . , ì,
and the general solution to ì = ì can be written as

        ì = 1ì11 + 2ì22 + · · · +  ì  .

The corresponding fundamental matrix solution is

        () = ì11 ì22 · · · ì  .

That is, () is the matrix whose th column is ì .

Example 3.4.4: Consider the system

                                            2 1 1
                                      ì = 1 2 0 ì.

Earlier, we found the eigenvalues are 1, 2, 3. We found the eigenvector 1 for the1

                                                                       0

eigenvalue 3. Similarly we find the eigenvector -1 for the eigenvalue 1 and 1 for the
                                                     0                 -1
eigenvalue 2 (exercise: check). The general solution is

     1                            0              1        1 + 33 
                                                                     
     ì = 1 -1  + 2  1  2 + 3 1 3 = -1 + 22 + 33 .

Exercise 3.4.3: Check that this ì really solves the system.
    Note: If we write a single homogeneous linear constant-coefficient th-order equation

as a first-order system (as we did in § 3.1), then the eigenvalue equation

                                                 det( - ) = 0

is essentially the same as the characteristic equation we got in § 2.2 and § 2.3.

3.4.3 Complex eigenvalues

A matrix may very well have complex eigenvalues even if all the entries are real. Take, for
example,

                                                 ì = 1 1 ì.
                                                         -1 1

Let us compute the eigenvalues of the matrix  =  11 .

                                                 -1 1

det( - ) = det                    1- 1      = (1 - )2 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 2 = 0.
                                   -1 1 - 

Thus  = 1 ± . Corresponding eigenvectors are also complex. Start with  = 1 - .

                                      - (1 - ) ì = 0ì,
                                      1 -1  ì = 0ì.

The equations 1 + 2 = 0 and -1 + 2 = 0 are multiples of each other. So we only need
to consider one of them. After picking 2 = 1, for example, we have an eigenvector ì = 1 .
                                  -  is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 + .
In similar fashion, we find that  1

We could write the solution as

ì =   ( 1  1-) +  - ( 2  1+) = 1(1-) - 2(1+) (1-) (1+) .
1                                    1           1 + 2

We would then need to look for complex values 1 and 2 to solve any initial conditions. It
is perhaps not completely clear that we get a real solution. After solving for 1 and 2, we

could use Euler's formula and do the whole song and dance we did before, but we will not.

We will apply the formula in a smarter way first to find independent real solutions.

We claim that we did not have to look for a second eigenvector (nor for the second

eigenvalue). All complex eigenvalues come in pairs (because the matrix  is real).  +¯

First a small detour.  The real part of a complex number   can be computed as       2,

where the bar above  means  +  =  - . The bar of  is called the complex conjugate of

. If  is a real number, then ¯ = . Similarly we bar whole vectors or matrices by taking
144                                                               CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

the complex conjugate of every entry. Suppose a matrix  is real. Then  = , and so
ì =  ì = ì. Also the complex conjugate of 0 is still 0, therefore,

                                     0ì = 0ì = ( - )ì = ( - ¯ )ì.

In other words, if  =  +  is an eigenvalue, then so is ¯ =  - . And if ì is an
eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue , then ì is an eigenvector corresponding to
the eigenvalue ¯ .

    Suppose  +  is a complex eigenvalue of , and ì is a corresponding eigenvector. Then

                                                  ì1 = ì(+)

is a solution (complex-valued) of ì = ì. Euler's formula shows that  + =  -, and so

                                              ì2 = ì1 = ì(-)

is also a solution. As ì1 and ì2 are solutions, the function

             ì3 = Re ì1 = Re ì(+) = ì1 + ì1 = ì1 + ì2 = 1 ì1 + 1 ì2
                                                     2              2      22

is  also  a  solution.  And  ì3  is  real-valued!  Similarly  as  Im   =   -¯  is  the  imaginary  part,  we
                                                                            2

find that

                                     ì4 = Im ì1 = ì1 - ì1 2 = ì1 - ì2 2 .

is also a real-valued solution. It turns out that ì3 and ì4 are linearly independent. We will

use Euler's formula to separate out the real and imaginary part.

    Returning to our problem,

ì1 =  (1-) =                                        cos  +  sin   sin                       cos           .
                              cos  -  sin  =                               =               + 
          1             1                           cos  -  sin   cos                      - sin 

Then                                    sin                                 cos 
                           Re ì1 =                 and Im ì1 = 

                                        cos                                - sin 

are the two real-valued linearly independent solutions we seek.

Exercise 3.4.4: Check that these really are solutions.

    The general solution is

                              sin              cos            1 sin  + 2 cos 
             ì = 1                   + 2                =                               .
                              cos             - sin  1 cos  - 2 sin 

This solution is real-valued for real 1 and 2. At this point, we would solve for any initial
conditions we may have to find 1 and 2.

    We summarize the discussion as a theorem.
3.4. EIGENVALUE METHOD                                                                                        145

Theorem 3.4.2. Let  be a real-valued constant matrix. If  has a complex eigenvalue  +  and
a corresponding eigenvector ì, then  also has a complex eigenvalue  -  with a corresponding
eigenvector ì. Furthermore, ì = ì has two linearly independent real-valued solutions

                             ì1 = Re ì(+) and ì2 = Im ì(+) .

    For each pair of complex eigenvalues  +  and  - , we get two real-valued linearly
independent solutions. We then go on to the next eigenvalue, which is either a real
eigenvalue or another complex eigenvalue pair. If we have  distinct eigenvalues (real
or complex), then we end up with  linearly independent solutions. If we had only two
equations ( = 2) as in the example above, then once we found two solutions we are
finished, and our general solution is

                         ì = 1ì1 + 2ì2 = 1 Re ì(+) + 2 Im ì(+) .

    We can now find a real-valued general solution to any homogeneous system where the
matrix has distinct eigenvalues. When we have repeated eigenvalues, matters get a bit
more complicated and we will look at that situation in § 3.7.

3.5 Two-dimensional systems and their vector fields

Note: 1 lecture, part of §6.2 in [EP], parts of §7.5 and §7.6 in [BD]

We take a moment to discuss constant-coefficient linear homogeneous systems in the

plane. Much intuition can be obtained by studying this simple case. We use coordinates
                                                    
(, ) for the plane as usual, and suppose  =             is a 2 × 2 matrix. Consider the system

                                                           
                           =   or  =    . (3.3)

The system is autonomous (compare this section to § 1.6), and so we draw a vector field (see

the end of § 3.1). We will be able to visually understand this vectorfield and the solutions
of the ODE in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix . For this section,
we assume that  has two distinct eigenvalues and two corresponding eigenvectors. We
will also assume that  is nonsingular, that is, neither eigenvalue is zero.

Case 1. Suppose that the eigenvalues of  are real and positive. We find two corre-

sponding eigenvectors and plot them in the plane. For example, take the matrix            11  . The
                                                                                          02

eigenvalues are 1 and 2 and corresponding eigenvectors are             1  and  1  . See Figure 3.4.
                                                                       0       1
Let (, ) be a point on the line deter-
                                                    -3  -2  -1            0       1    2      3
mined by an eigenvector ì for an eigenvalue 3
                                                                                                 3

. That is,     = ì for some scalar . Then        2                                               2

 =   = (ì) = (ì) = ì.

                                                 0                                               0

The derivative is a multiple of ì and hence -1                                                   -1
points along the line determined by ì. As

 > 0, the derivative points in the direction -2                                                  -2

of ì when  is positive and in the opposite

direction when  is negative. We draw the         -3     -2  -1            0       1    2         -3
                                                    -3                                        3

lines determined by the eigenvectors and                Figure 3.4: Eigenvectors of .
arrows on the lines to indicate the directions.

See Figure 3.5 on the following page.

We fill in the rest of the arrows for the vector field, and we draw a few solutions. See

Figure 3.6 on the next page. The picture looks like a source with arrows coming out from

the origin. Hence we call this type of picture a source or sometimes an unstable node.

Case 2. Suppose both eigenvalues are negative. For example, take the negation of the

matrix from case 1,  -1 -1     . The eigenvalues are -1 and -2 and corresponding eigenvectors
                      0 -2

are the same,  1     and    1  .  The calculation and the picture are almost the same.        The
               0            1

difference is that the eigenvalues are negative and arrows are reversed. We get the picture

in Figure 3.7 on the following page. We call this type of picture a sink or a stable node.

    Case 3. Suppose one eigenvalue is positive and one is negative. For example, consider

=       11        .  The eigenvalues are 1 and -2 and corresponding eigenvectors are      1  and
        0 -2                                                                              0

 1      . We reverse the arrows on the line corresponding to the negative eigenvalue and we
-3

obtain the picture in Figure 3.8. We call this picture a saddle point.

    For the next three cases, we will assume the eigenvalues are complex. In this case the
eigenvectors are also complex and we cannot just plot them in the plane.

    Case 4. Suppose the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, that is, ±. For example, let

=        01       . The eigenvalues are ±2 and corresponding eigenvectors are       1  and    1.

                                                                                             -2

                                                                   2

are
                     Re 12 2 = cos(2) -2 sin(2) , Im 12 2 = sin(2) 2 cos(2) .

We can take any linear combination of them to get other solutions, which one we take
depends on the initial conditions. Now note that the real part is a parametric equation for
an ellipse. Same with the imaginary part and in fact any linear combination of the two.
This is what happens in general when the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So when the
eigenvalues are purely imaginary, we get ellipses for the solutions. This type of picture is
sometimes called a center. See Figure 3.9.

    Case 5. Now suppose the complex eigenvalues have a positive real part. That is, suppose

the eigenvalues are  ±  for some  > 0. For example, let  =                11     . The eigenvalues
                                                                         -4 1
turn out to be 1 ± 2 and eigenvectors are                            . We take 1 + 2 and its eigenvector
                                                     1   and      1
                                                     2           -2
        and find the real and imaginary parts of ì(1+2) are

            Re 12 (1+2) =  cos(2) -2 sin(2) , Im 12 (1+2) =  sin(2) 2 cos(2) .

Note the  in front of the solutions. The solutions grow in magnitude while spinning
around the origin. Hence we get a spiral source. See Figure 3.10.

    Case 6. Finally suppose the complex eigenvalues have a negative real part. That is,

suppose the eigenvalues are - ±  for some  > 0. For example, let  =                 -1 -1 . The

eigenvalues turn out to be -1 ± 2 and eigenvectors are                               4 -1
                                                                                 . We take -1 - 2
                                                                      1  and  1
                                                                     -2       2
                           and find the real and imaginary parts of ì(-1-2) are

                     2

    We summarize the behavior of linear homogeneous two-dimensional systems given
by a nonsingular matrix in Table 3.1. Systems where one of the eigenvalues is zero (the
matrix is singular) come up in practice from time to time, see Example 3.1.2 on page 121,
and the pictures are somewhat different (simpler in a way). See the exercises. When the
eigenvalues are real and repeated, the analysis is a little bit more difficult and we have
not yet covered how to solve such systems, but the idea is roughly the same--a repeated
positive eigenvalue means a source and a repeated negative eigenvalue means a sink.

     Eigenvalues                      Behavior

     real and both positive           source / unstable node
     real and both negative           sink / stable node
     real and opposite signs          saddle

3.6.1 Undamped mass-spring systems

While we did say that we can usually only study first-order systems, it is sometimes more
convenient to analyze the system in the way it arises naturally. For example, consider 3
masses connected by springs between two walls. We could pick any higher number, and
the math would be essentially the same, but for simplicity, we pick 3 right now. We also
assume no friction, that is, the system is undamped. The masses are 1, 2, and 3 and
the spring constants are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let 1 be the displacement from rest position of
the first mass, and 2 and 3 the displacement of the second and third mass. We make, as
usual, positive values go right (as 1 grows, the first mass is moving right). See Figure 3.12.

               1             1       2    2       3    3               4

                           Figure 3.12: System of masses and springs.

    This simple system turns up in unexpected places. For example, our world really
consists of many small particles of matter interacting together. When we try the system
above with many more masses, we obtain a good approximation to how an elastic material
behaves. By somehow taking a limit of the number of masses going to infinity, we obtain
the continuous one-dimensional wave equation (that we study in § 4.7). But we digress.

    Let us set up the equations for the three mass system. By Hooke's law, the force acting
on the mass equals the spring compression times the spring constant. By Newton's second
law, force is mass times acceleration. So if we sum the forces acting on each mass, put the
right sign in front of each term, depending on the direction in which it is acting, and set
this equal to mass times the acceleration, we end up with the desired system of equations.

          11 = -11 + 2(2 - 1)                  = -(1 + 2)1 + 22,
          22 = -2(2 - 1) + 3(3 - 2)            = 21 - (2 + 3)2 + 33,
                                               = 32 - (3 + 4)3.
          33 = -3(3 - 2) - 43

We define the matrices

          1 0           0                    -(1 + 2)     2               0       
                                                                                  
       =    0  2        0       and       =    2       -(2 + 3)           3         .

3.6. SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS       153

We write the equation simply as

                                 ì = ì.

At this point we could introduce 3 new variables and write out a system of 6 first-order

equations. We claim this simple setup is easier to handle as a second-order system. We call
ì the displacement vector,  the mass matrix, and  the stiffness matrix.

Exercise 3.6.1: Repeat this setup for 4 masses (find the matrices  and ). Do it for 5 masses.
Can you find a prescription to do it for  masses?

    As with a single equation, we want to "divide by ." This means computing the
inverse of . The masses are all nonzero and  is a diagonal matrix, so computing the

inverse is easy:

                                 1 0 0
                                  1      
                                 -1 =  0 1 0  .
                                  2 
                                 0 0 1
                                         3 

This fact follows readily by how we multiply diagonal matrices. As an exercise, you should
verify that  -1 = -1 = .

Let  = -1. We look at the system ì = -1ì, or

                                 ì = ì.

Many real world systems can be modeled by this equation. For simplicity, we will only talk
about the given masses-and-springs problem. We try a solution of the form

                                                     ì = ì .

We compute that for this guess, ì = 2ì. We plug our guess into the equation and get

                                                2ì  = ì  .

We divide by  to arrive at 2ì = ì. Hence if 2 is an eigenvalue of  and ì is a
corresponding eigenvector, we have found a solution.

    In our example, and in other common applications,  has only real negative eigenvalues
(and possibly a zero eigenvalue). So we study only this case. When an eigenvalue  is
negative, it means that 2 =  is negative. Hence there is some real number  such that
-2 = . Then  = ±. For  = , the solution we guessed is ì = ì or

                                         ì = ì cos() +  sin() .

By taking the real and imaginary parts (note that ì is real), we find that ì cos() and
ì sin() are linearly independent solutions.

    If an eigenvalue is zero, it turns out that both ì and ì are solutions, where ì is an
eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.
154                                                            CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

Exercise 3.6.2: Show that if  has a zero eigenvalue and ì is a corresponding eigenvector, then
ì = ì( + ) is a solution of ì = ì for arbitrary constants  and .

Theorem 3.6.1. Let  be a real  ×  matrix with  distinct real negative (or zero) eigenvalues we
denote by -21 > -22 > · · · > -2 , and corresponding eigenvectors by ì1, ì2, . . . , ì. If  is
invertible (that is, if 1 > 0), then

                                                             

                                  ì() = ì  cos() +  sin()

                                                            =1

is the general solution of

                                        ì = ì,

for some arbitrary constants  and . If  has a zero eigenvalue, that is, 1 = 0, and all other
eigenvalues are distinct and negative, then the general solution can be written as

                                            

     ì() = ì1(1 + 1) + ì  cos() +  sin() .

                                          =2

    We use this solution and the setup from the introduction of this section even when
some of the masses and springs are missing. For example, when there are only 2 masses
and only 2 springs, simply take only the equations for the two masses and set all the spring
constants for the springs that are missing to zero.

3.6.2 Examples

Example 3.6.1: Consider the setup in Figure 3.13, with 1 = 2 kg, 2 = 1 kg, 1 = 4 N/m,
and 2 = 2 N/m.

                            1           2

                            01          2 -2

or
                                                ì = -3 1 ì.

    We find the eigenvalues of  to be  = -1, -4 (exercise). We find corresponding

eigenvectors to be  1       and   1       respectively (exercise). We check the theorem and note
                    2            -1
that 1 = 1 and 2 = 2. Hence the general solution is

                 ì = 12 1 cos() + 1 sin() + 1-1 2 cos(2) + 2 sin(2) .

    The two terms in the solution represent the two so-called natural or normal modes of
oscillation. And the two (angular) frequencies are the natural frequencies. The first natural
frequency is 1, and the second is 2. The two modes are plotted in Figure 3.14.

Figure 3.14: The two modes of the mass-spring system. In the left plot the masses are moving in unison
and in the right plot are masses moving in the opposite direction.

    Let us write the solution as
                             ì = 12 1 cos( - 1) + 1-1 2 cos(2 - 2).

The first term,                  12 1 cos( - 1) = 1 cos( - 1) 2 , 1 cos( - 1)

corresponds to the mode where the masses move synchronously in the same direction.
    The second term,

                            1-1 2 cos(2 - 2) = 2 cos(2 - 2) - , 2 cos(2 - 2)

corresponds to the mode where the masses move synchronously but in opposite directions.

    The general solution is a combination of the two modes. That is, the initial conditions

determine the amplitude and phase shift of each mode. As an example, suppose we have

initial conditions

                                 ì(0) = 1-1 ,         ì(0) = 0 .
                                                                 6
156                                      CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

We use the  ,  constants to solve for initial conditions. First

                               1-1 = ì(0) = 12 1 + 1-1 2 = 1 + 2 2 . 1 - 2
We solve (exercise) to find 1 = 0, 2 = 1. To find the 1 and 2, we differentiate first:

     ì = 12 -1 sin() + 1 cos() + 1-1 -22 sin(2) + 22 cos(2) .

Now we solve:  06 = ì(0) = 12 1 + 1-1 22 = 1 + 22 2 . 1 - 22

Again solve (exercise) to find 1 = 2, 2 = -1. So our solution is

     ì = 12 2 sin() + 1-1 cos(2) - sin(2) = 2 sin() + cos(2) - sin(2) 4 sin() - cos(2) + sin(2) .

The graphs of the two displacements, 1 and 2 of the two carts is in Figure 3.15.

Example 3.6.2: We have two toy rail cars. Car 1 of mass 2 kg is traveling at 3 m/s towards

the second rail car of mass 1 kg. There is a bumper on the second rail car that engages at

the moment the cars hit (it connects to two cars) and does not let go. The bumper acts
like a spring of spring constant  = 2 N/m. The second car is 10 meters from a wall. See

Figure 3.16 on the next page.

    We want to ask several questions. At what time after the cars link does impact with the

wall happen? What is the speed of car 2 when it hits the wall?
    OK, let us first set the system up. Let  = 0 be the time when the two cars link up. Let 1

be the displacement of the first car from the position at  = 0, and let 2 be the displacement

of the second car from its original location. Then the time when 2() = 10 is exactly the
time when impact with the wall occurs. For this , 2 () is the speed at impact. This system
acts just like the system of the previous example but without 1. Hence the equation is

               2 0 ì = -2 2 ì,
               01                             2 -2

or
                                                ì = -1 1 ì.
                                                         2 -2

    We compute the eigenvalues of . It is not hard to see that the eigenvalues are 0 and

-3 (exercise). Furthermore, eigenvectors are  1  and               1  respectively (exercise). Then
                                              1                   -2

1 = 0, 2 = 3, and by the second part of the theorem the general solution is

      ì = 1 (1 + 1) + 1                                               

         1         -2      2 cos( 3 ) + 2 sin( 3 )

                                                               
      = 1 + 1 + 2 cos(3 ) + 2 sin( 3 ) .
         1 + 1 - 22 cos( 3 ) - 22 sin( 3 )

    We now apply the initial conditions. First the cars start at position 0 so 1(0) = 0 and
2(0) = 0. The first car is traveling at 3 m/s, so 1 (0) = 3 and the second car starts at rest, so
2 (0) = 0. The first conditions says

               0 = ì(0) =ì                    1 + 2            .

                                              1 - 22

It is not hard to see that 1 = 2 = 0. We set 1 = 0 and 2 = 0 in ì() and differentiate to get

                                                   
            ì() = 1 + 3 2 cos( 3 ) .
                  1 - 2 3 2 cos( 3 )

So                                               

            3 = ì(0) = 1 + 3 2 .

Solving these two equations, we find 1 = 2 and 2 = 13 . Hence the position of our cars is
(until the impact with the wall)

                                                         

                                                  1
                                          2 +  sin( 3 )
                                 ì =              3 .

                                                  2
                                          2 -  sin( 3 )
                                                  3

Note how the presence of the zero eigenvalue resulted in a term containing . This means

that the cars will be traveling in the positive direction as time grows, which is what we

expect.

    What we are really interested in is the second expression, the one for 2. We have
2() = 2 - 23 sin( 3 ). See Figure 3.17 for the plot of 2 versus time.

    Just from the graph we can see that the time of impact will be a little more than 5 seconds
from time zero. For this we have to solve the equation 10 = 2() = 2 - 23 sin( 3 ). Using
a computer (or even a graphing calculator) we find that impact  5.22 seconds.

The      speed  of  the  second  car  is       =
           
                                            2             0  1  2  3  4  5  6

2 - 2 cos( 3 ). At the time of impact (5.22 12.5                               12.5

seconds from  = 0) we get 2 (impact)  3.85.

The maximum speed is the maximum of 10.0                                       10.0

2 - 2 cos( 3 ), which is 4. We are traveling

at almost the maximum speed when we hit 7.5 7.5

the wall.                                            5.0                       5.0

Suppose that Bob is a tiny person sitting            2.5                       2.5

on car 2. Bob has a Martini in his hand and

would like not to spill it. Let us suppose 0.0                                 0.0

Bob would not spill his Martini when the                  0  1  2  3  4  5  6

the wall at any speed greater than zero, Bob (ignoring the wall).

will spill his drink. Suppose Bob can move

car 2 a few meters towards or away from

the wall (he cannot go all the way to the wall, nor can he get out of the way of the first car).

Is there a "safe" distance for him to be at? A distance such that the impact with the wall is

at zero speed?
    The answer is yes. On Figure 3.17, note the "plateau" between  = 3 and  = 4.There is

a point where the speed is zero. To find it we solve 2 () = 0. This is when cos( 3 ) = 1
or in other words when  = 2 , 4 , . . . and so on. We plug in the first value to obtain

                                                        33

2 2 = 4  7.26. So a "safe" distance is about 7 and a quarter meters from the wall.
     3       3

Alternatively Bob could move away from the wall towards the incoming car 2, where

another safe distance is 2 4 = 8  14.51 and so on. We can use all the different  such
                             3        3
that 2 () = 0. Of course  = 0 is also a solution, corresponding to 2 = 0, but that means

standing right at the wall.

3.6.3 Forced oscillations

Finally we move to forced oscillations. Suppose that now our system is

                                      ì = ì + ì cos().                  (3.4)

That is, we are adding periodic forcing to the system in the direction of the vector ì.
    As before, this system just requires us to find one particular solution ì, add it to the

general solution of the associated homogeneous system ì, and we will have the general
solution to (3.4). Let us suppose that  is not one of the natural frequencies of ì = ì,

then we can guess

                                          ì = ì cos(),

where ì is an unknown constant vector. Note that we do not need to use sine since there
are only second derivatives. We solve for ì to find ì. This is really just the method of
undetermined coefficients for systems. Let us differentiate ì twice to get

                                          ì   =  -2 ì  cos().

                                            

Plug  ì  and  ì   into  equation  (3.4):

                

                                  ì                 ì

                                    

                        -2ì cos() = ì cos() +ì cos().

We cancel out the cosine and rearrange the equation to obtain

                                          ( + 2)ì = -ì.

So                                                    2 -1 ì
                                                     ) (-).
                                      ì   =   (  +

Of course this is possible only if ( + 2) =  - (-2) is invertible. That matrix is
invertible if and only if -2 is not an eigenvalue of . That is true if and only if  is not a
natural frequency of the system.

    We simplified things a little bit. If we wish to have the forcing term to be in the units of
force, say Newtons, then we must write

                                           ì = ì + ì cos().
If we then write things in terms of  = -1, we have

                  ì = -1ì + -1ì cos() or ì = ì + ì cos(),

where ì = -1ì.

Example 3.6.3: Let us take the example in Figure 3.13 on page 154 with the same parameters
as before: 1 = 2, 2 = 1, 1 = 4, and 2 = 2. Now suppose that there is a force 2 cos(3)
acting on the second cart.
160                                                     CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

The equation is

     2 0 0 1 ì = -(4 + 2) 2 2 -2 ì + 02 cos(3) or ì = -3 1 2 -2 ì + 02 cos(3).

We solved the associated homogeneous equation before and found the complementary
solution to be

                   ì = 12 1 cos() + 1 sin() + 1-1 2 cos(2) + 2 sin(2) .

    The natural frequencies are 1 and 2. As 3 is not a natural frequency, we try ì cos(3).
We invert ( + 32):

                      -3 1       -1  6 1 -1                 7 -1
                            2                               40 40
                            +3  =                       = -1 3 .
                      2 -2           27
                                                            20 20

Hence,                               7 -1               0 120
                                     40 40
                            -1 ì
                      ì = ( + 2) (-) = -1 3                 = -3 .
                                                        -2
                                     20 20                           10

    Combining with the general solution of the associated homogeneous problem, we get
that the general solution to ì = ì + ì cos() is

ì = ì + ì = 1         1 cos() + 1 sin() + 1                                     1
                   2                                -1
                                                        2 cos(2) + 2 sin(2)  +  20  cos(3).
                                                                                -3

                                                                                10

We would then solve for the constants 1, 2, 1, and 2 using any given initial conditions.

    Note that given force ì, we write the equation as ì = ì + ì to get the units right.
Then we write ì = -1ì + -1 ì. The term ì = -1 ì in ì = ì + ì is in units of force

per unit mass.
    If  is a natural frequency of the system, resonance may occur, because we will have to

try a particular solution of the form

                      ì = ì  sin() + ì cos().

That is assuming that the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix are distinct. Next, note that
the amplitude of this solution grows without bound as  grows.

3.6.4 Exercises

Exercise 3.6.3: Find a particular solution to

Exercise 3.6.4 (challenging): Consider the example in Figure 3.13 on page 154 with the same
parameters as before: 1 = 2, 1 = 4, and 2 = 2, except for 2, which is unknown. Suppose
that there is a force cos(5) acting on the first mass. Find an 2 such that there exists a particular
solution where the first mass does not move.

    Note: This idea is called dynamic damping. In practice there will be a small amount of

damping and so any transient solution will disappear and after long enough time, the first mass will

always come to a stop.

Exercise 3.6.5: Let us take the Example 3.6.2 on page 156, but that at time of impact, car 2 is
moving to the left with speed 3 m/s.

a) Find the behavior of the system after linkup.
b) Will the second car hit the wall, or will it be moving away from the wall as time goes on?
c) At what speed would the first car have to be traveling for the system to essentially stay in

   place after linkup?

Exercise 3.6.6: Let us take the example in Figure 3.13 on page 154 with parameters 1 = 2 = 1,
1 = 2 = 1. Does there exist a set of initial conditions for which the first cart moves but the second

cart does not? If so, find those conditions. If not, argue why not.

Exercise 3.6.102: Suppose there are three carts of equal mass  and connected by two springs of
constant  (and no connections to walls). Set up the system and find its general solution.

Exercise 3.6.103: Suppose a cart of mass 2 kg is attached by a spring of constant  = 1 to a cart of
mass 3 kg, which is attached to the wall by a spring also of constant  = 1. Suppose that the initial
position of the first cart is 1 meter in the positive direction from the rest position, and the second cart
starts at the rest position. The carts are not moving and are let go. Find the position of the second
cart as a function of time.

3.7 Repeated eigenvalues

Note: 1 or 1.5 lectures, §5.5 in [EP], §7.8 in [BD]

    It may happen that a matrix  has some "repeated" eigenvalues. That is, the character-
istic equation det( - ) = 0 may have repeated roots. This is actually unlikely to happen
for a random matrix. If we take a small perturbation of  (we change the entries of 
slightly), we get a matrix with distinct eigenvalues. As any system we want to solve in
practice is an approximation to reality anyway, it is not absolutely indispensable to know
how to solve these corner cases. On the other hand, these cases do come up in applications
from time to time. Furthermore, if we have distinct but very close eigenvalues, the behavior
is similar to that of repeated eigenvalues, and so understanding that case will give us
insight into what is going on.

3.7.1 Geometric multiplicity

Take the diagonal matrix

                                   = 3 0 .
                                          03

 has an eigenvalue 3 of multiplicity 2. We call the multiplicity of the eigenvalue in the

characteristic equation the algebraic multiplicity. In this case, there also exist 2 linearly

independent eigenvectors,  1  and  0  corresponding to the eigenvalue 3. This means
                           0       1

that the so-called geometric multiplicity of this eigenvalue is also 2.

In all the theorems where we required a matrix to have  distinct eigenvalues, we only

really needed to have  linearly independent eigenvectors. For example, ì = ì has the

general solution

                              ì = 1 10 3 + 2 01 3 .

We restate the theorem about real eigenvalues. In the theorem, we will repeat eigenvalues
according to (algebraic) multiplicity. So for the matrix  above, we would say that it has

eigenvalues 3 and 3.

Theorem 3.7.1. Suppose the  ×  matrix  has  real eigenvalues (not necessarily distinct), 1,
2, . . . , , and there are  linearly independent corresponding eigenvectors ì1, ì2, . . . , ì. Then
the general solution to ì = ì can be written as

                          ì = 1ì11 + 2ì22 + · · · +  ì  .

    The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is equal to the number of corresponding
linearly independent eigenvectors. The geometric multiplicity is always less than or equal
to the algebraic multiplicity. The theorem handles the case when these two multiplicities
are equal for all eigenvalues. If for an eigenvalue the geometric multiplicity is equal to the
algebraic multiplicity, then we say the eigenvalue is complete.
3.7. REPEATED EIGENVALUES                                                                163

    In other words, the hypothesis of the theorem could be stated as saying that if all the
eigenvalues of  are complete, then there are  linearly independent eigenvectors and thus

we have the given general solution.

If the geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is 2 or greater, then the set of linearly

independent eigenvectors is not unique up to multiples as it was before. For example, for

the diagonal matrix  =  30       we could also pick eigenvectors  1  and   1    , or in fact any
                        03                                        1       -1

pair of two linearly independent vectors. The number of linearly independent eigenvectors

corresponding to  is the number of free variables we obtain when solving ì = ì. We

pick specific values for those free variables to obtain eigenvectors. If you pick different

values, you may get different eigenvectors.

3.7.2 Defective eigenvalues

If an  ×  matrix has less than  linearly independent eigenvectors, it is said to be deficient.
Then there is at least one eigenvalue with its geometric multiplicity that is less than its
algebraic multiplicity. We call this eigenvalue defective and the difference between the two
multiplicities we call the defect. In other words, the defect is the number of eigenvectors we
are "missing."

Example 3.7.1: The matrix
                                                        31
                                                        03

has an eigenvalue 3 of algebraic multiplicity 2. As  -  =            31  -3 10        =  0 1 , to
                                                                     03
                                                                                  01     00

compute the eigenvectors, we must solve

                                 0 1 1 ì
                                               = 0.

                                 0 0 2

So 2 = 0. All eigenvectors are of the form                  1  .  Any two such vectors are linearly
                                                            0

dependent, and hence the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue is 1. Therefore, the

defect is 1, and we can no longer apply the eigenvalue method directly to a system of ODEs

with such a coefficient matrix.

    To solve such an ODE, we need a new idea. Roughly, the key observation we will use is
that if  is an eigenvalue of  of algebraic multiplicity , then it is possible to find certain
 linearly independent vectors solving ( - )ì = 0ì for various powers . We will call

these generalized eigenvectors.

We continue with the example equation ì = ì where  =                     31  .  We found an
                                                                         03
eigenvalue  = 3 of (algebraic) multiplicity 2 and defect 1. We found one eigenvector

ì =  1  . We have one solution
     0

                                 ì1 = ì3 = 10 3 .
164                                                                         CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

We are now stuck, we get no other solutions from standard eigenvectors. But we need two

linearly independent solutions to find the general solution of the equation.

     In the spirit of repeated roots of the characteristic equation for a single equation, we try

another solution of the form                    ì2 = (ì2 + ì1) 3 .

We differentiate to get

                        ì    =  ì1  3  +  3(ì2  +  ì1)   3   =  (3ì2   +    ì1)   3  +  3ì13 .

                          2

As   we  are  assuming    that  ì2    is  a  solution,  ì    must  equal    ì2.      So  we  compute  ì2:

                                                          2

                                ì2 = (ì2 + ì1) 3 = ì23 + ì13 .

By looking at the coefficients of 3 and 3, we see 3ì2 + ì1 = ì2 and 3ì1 = ì1. This

means that

                             ( - 3)ì2 = ì1, and ( - 3)ì1 = 0ì.

Therefore, ì2 is a solution if these two equations are satisfied. The second equation is

satisfied if ì1 is an eigenvector, and we found the eigenvector above, so let ì1 =                    1    . So, if
                                                                                                      0
we can find a ì2 that solves ( - 3)ì2 = ì1, then we are done. This is just a bunch of linear

equations to solve and we are by now very good at that. Let us solve ( - 3)ì2 = ì1. Write

                                                0 1  0 0  = 10 .

By inspection, we see that letting  = 0 ( could be anything in fact) and  = 1 does the job.

Hence we can take ì2 =             0  . Our general solution to ì = ì is
                                   1

                        ì = 1 10 3 + 2             01              3 13 + 23                    .
                                                        +  =                            3
                                                   10                                2

Let  us  check  that  we  really   do  have  the   solution.    First       =  1 3 3    + 23  + 323   =  31 + 2.

Good.    Now         =  32  3   =  32.    Good.                          1

                  2

     In the example, if we plug ( - 3)ì2 = ì1 into ( - 3)ì1 = 0ì we find

                          ( - 3)( - 3)ì2 = 0ì, or ( - 3)2ì2 = 0ì.

If ( - 3)ì  0ì and ( - 3)2ì = 0ì, then ( - 3)ì is an eigenvector, a multiple of ì1. In this
2 × 2 case, ( - 3)2 is just the zero matrix (exercise). So any vector ì solves ( - 3)2ì = 0ì
and we just need a ì such that ( - 3)ì  0ì. Then we could use ì for ì2 and ( - 3)ì
for ì1.

    Note this example system ì = ì has a simpler solution since  is a so-called upper

triangular matrix, that is, every entry below the diagonal is zero. In particular, the equation
for 2 does not depend on 1. Mind you, not every defective matrix is triangular.

Exercise 3.7.1: Solve ì =  31     ì by first solving for 2 and then for 1 independently. Check that
                           03

you got the same solution as we did above.

    Let us describe the general algorithm. Suppose that  is an eigenvalue of multiplicity 2,
defect 1. First find an eigenvector ì1 of . That is, ì1 solves ( - )ì1 = 0ì. Then, find a
vector ì2 such that

                                                ( - )ì2 = ì1.

This gives us two linearly independent solutions

                                               ì1 = ì1 ,
                                               ì2 = ì2 + ì1  .

Example 3.7.2: Consider the system

                                                 2       -5 0
                                                          2 0 ì.
                                        ì  =     0

                                               -1 4 1

Compute the eigenvalues,

                                        2 -             -5       0  
                                                       2-           
    0 = det( - ) = det                        0                  0       = (2 - )2(1 - ).
                                                         4     1 - 
                                           -1

The eigenvalues are 1 and 2, where 2 has multiplicity 2. We leave it to the reader to find

           0

that 0 is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue  = 1.

           1

    We focus on  = 2. We compute eigenvectors:

                                                       0  -5     0    1
                                                                      2
                           0ì  =  (  -  2)ì      =     0    0    0       .

                                                    -1 4 -1 3

The first equation says that 2 = 0, so the last equation is -1 - 3 = 0. Let 3 be the free

                                                                                                                                      1

variable to find that 1 = -3. Perhaps let 3 = -1 to find an eigenvector 0 . Problem is

                                                                                                                                     -1

that setting 3 to anything else just gets multiples of this vector and so we have a defect
of 1. Let ì1 be the eigenvector and we look for a generalized eigenvector ì2:

                                           ( - 2)ì2 = ì1,

or                                         -5       0          1
                                                               
                                     0                              
                                                                    
                                     0     0        0       =    0    ,

                                  -1       4     -1            -1
                                                          

where we used , ,  as components of ì2 for simplicity. The first equation says -5 = 1
so  = -1/5. The second equation says nothing. The last equation is - + 4 -  = -1, or
166                                      CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

 + 4/5 +  = 1, or  +  = 1/5. We let  be the free variable, and we choose  = 0. We find

ì2 =  1/5

      -1/5 .

       0

The general solution is therefore,

              0                     1     1/5   1 
                                           
                                      2  -1    2
              ì = 1 0  + 2  0   + 3  /5 +  0    .
              1                     -1    0  -1
                                           

    This machinery can also be generalized to higher multiplicities and higher defects. We
will not go over this method in detail, but we sketch the idea. Suppose that  has an
eigenvalue  of multiplicity . We find vectors such that

                             ( - )ì = 0ì, but ( - )-1ì  0ì.

Such vectors are called generalized eigenvectors (then ì1 = ( - )-1ì is an eigenvector).
For the eigenvector ì1 there is a chain of generalized eigenvectors ì2 through ì such that:

                   ( - )ì1 = 0ì,
                   ( - )ì2 = ì1,

                                  ...

                   ( - )ì = ì-1.

Really once you find the ì such that ( - )ì = 0ì but ( - )-1ì  0ì, you find the
entire chain since you can compute the rest, ì-1 = ( - )ì, ì-2 = ( - )ì-1, etc. We

form the linearly independent solutions

              ì1 = ì1 ,
              ì2 = (ì2 + ì1)  ,

                  ...

              ì = ì + ì-1 + ì-2 2 + · · · + 2 ì2  ( - + 2)! ì1 ( - 1)!  -2  -1  .

Recall that ! = 1 · 2 · 3 · · · ( - 1) ·  is the factorial. If you have an eigenvalue of geometric
multiplicity  , you will have to find  such chains (some of them might be short: just the
single eigenvector equation). We go until we form  linearly independent solutions where
 is the algebraic multiplicity. We do not quite know which specific eigenvectors go with
which chain, so start by finding ì first for the longest possible chain and go from there.

    For example, if  is an eigenvalue of  of algebraic multiplicity 3 and defect 2, then

solve
                     ( - )ì1 = 0ì, ( - )ì2 = ì1, ( - )ì3 = ì2.
3.7. REPEATED EIGENVALUES                                                        167

That is, find ì3 such that ( - )3ì3 = 0ì, but ( - )2ì3  0ì. Then you are done as
ì2 = ( - )ì3 and ì1 = ( - )ì2. The 3 linearly independent solutions are

ì1 = ì1 ,               ì2 = (ì2 + ì1)  ,            ì3 = ì3 + ì2 + ì1 2  .
                                                                              2

    If, on the other hand,  has an eigenvalue  of algebraic multiplicity 3 and defect 1,

then solve
                      ( - )ì1 = 0ì, ( - )ì2 = 0ì, ( - )ì3 = ì2.

Here ì1 and ì2 are actual honest eigenvectors, and ì3 is a generalized eigenvector. So
there are two chains. To solve, first find a ì3 such that ( - )2ì3 = 0ì, but ( - )ì3  0ì.
Then ì2 = ( - )ì3 is going to be an eigenvector. Then solve for an eigenvector ì1 that is
linearly independent from ì2. You get 3 linearly independent solutions

                 ì1 = ì1 , ì2 = ì2 , ì3 = (ì3 + ì2)  .

3.8.1 Definition

There is another way of finding a fundamental matrix solution of a system. Consider the

constant-coefficient equation

                                        ì = ì.

If this would be just one equation (when  is a number or a 1 × 1 matrix), then the solution

would be                                ì =  .

That does not (yet) make sense if  is a larger matrix, but essentially the same computation
that led to the above works for matrices when we define  properly. First we write the

Recall ! = 1 · 2 · 3 · · ·  is the factorial, and 0! = 1. We differentiate this series term by term

   = 0 +  + 2 + 32 + 43 + · · · =  1 +  + ()2 + ()3 + · · · =   .
                               2     6                          2         6

Maybe we can try the same trick with matrices. For an  ×  matrix  we define the matrix
exponential as

                   def               12 13                   1
                   =  ++  +  +···+  +···
                                     26                      !

We will not worry about convergence--the series really does always converge. We usually
write  as  by convention when  is a matrix. With this small change and by the exact

same calculation as above, we have that

                                       = .
                                     

Now  and hence  is an  ×  matrix. What we are looking for is a vector. In the 1 × 1

case we would at this point multiply by an arbitrary constant to get the general solution. In
the matrix case we multiply by a column vector ì.

Theorem 3.8.1. Let  be an  ×  matrix. Then the general solution to ì = ì is

                                        ì =  ì,

where ì is an arbitrary constant vector. In fact, ì(0) = ì.

Check:                      ì =   ì =  ì = ì.
                            

Hence  is a fundamental matrix solution of the homogeneous system. If we can

compute the matrix exponential, we have another method of solving constant-coefficient
homogeneous systems. It also makes it easy to solve for initial conditions. To solve ì = ì,

ì(0) = ì, we take the solution
                                                     ì = ì.

This equation follows because 0 = , so ì(0) = 0ì = ì.

    We mention a drawback of matrix exponentials. In general +  . The trouble is
that matrices do not commute, that is, in general   . If you would try to rewrite
 as + using the Taylor series, you will see why the lack of commutativity becomes a
problem. It is true that if  = , that is, if  and  commute, then + = . We will

find this fact useful. We restate this as a theorem to make a point.

Theorem 3.8.2. If  = , then + = . Otherwise, +   in general.

3.8.2 Simple cases

In some instances it may work to just plug into the series definition. Suppose the matrix is
                           0
diagonal. For example,  =  0  . Then

                                   0
                                 =         ,
                                       0

and

            =  +  + 12 + 13 + · · ·
                      2       6
                                                                       0
                      1 0  0 1 2 0 1 3 0                                 .
                =     +       +        2+              3 +··· =
                      01 0 2 0  6 0                                   0

In particular,                               0

                       =  0 0         and  =           0      .

This makes exponentials of certain other matrices easy to compute. For example, the

matrix  =        54   can be written as 3 +  where  =   24    . Notice that 2 =  0 0 . So
                -1 1                                   -1 -2
                                                                                 00
 = 0 for all   2. Therefore,  =  + . Suppose we actually want to compute . The
matrices 3 and  commute (exercise: check this) and  =  + , since ()2 = 22 = 0.

We write

 = 3+ = 3  = 3 30 ( + ) =
                                  0

                              3 0      1 + 2 4                (1 + 2) 3 43
                           =        3  - 1 - 2 = -3 (1 - 2) 3 .
                                 0
3.8. MATRIX EXPONENTIALS                                   171

We found a fundamental matrix solution for the system ì = ì. Note that this matrix has
a repeated eigenvalue with a defect; there is only one eigenvector for the eigenvalue 3. So
we found a perhaps easier way to handle this case. In fact, if a matrix  is 2 × 2 and has an
eigenvalue  of multiplicity 2, then either  = , or  =  +  where 2 = 0. This is a
good exercise.

Exercise 3.8.1: Suppose that  is 2 × 2 and  is the only eigenvalue. Show that ( - )2 = 0,
and therefore that we can write  =  + , where 2 = 0 (and possibly  = 0). Hint: First write
down what does it mean for the eigenvalue to be of multiplicity 2. You will get an equation for the
entries. Now compute the square of .

    Matrices  such that  = 0 for some  are called nilpotent. Computation of the matrix
exponential for nilpotent matrices is easy by just writing down the first  terms of the
Taylor series.

3.8.3 General matrices

In general, the exponential is not as easy to compute as above. We usually cannot write a

matrix as a sum of commuting matrices where the exponential is simple for each one. But

fear not, it is still not too difficult provided we can find enough eigenvectors. First we need

the following interesting result about matrix exponentials. For two square matrices  and

, with  invertible, we have   -1 =  -1.

This can be seen by writing down the Taylor series. First

(-1)2 = -1-1 = -1 = 2-1.

And by the same reasoning (-1) =  -1. Now write the Taylor series for -1:

-1 =  + -1 + 1 (-1)2 + 1 (-1)3 + · · ·
                             2           6

= -1 + -1 + 1 2-1 + 1 3-1 + · · ·
                                2           6

=   +  + 1 2 + 1 3 + · · · -1
                26

= -1.

    Given a square matrix , we can usually write  = -1, where  is diagonal and
 invertible. This procedure is called diagonalization. If we can do that, the computation
of the exponential becomes easy as  is just taking the exponential of the entries on the
diagonal. Adding  into the mix, we can then compute the exponential

                                                  = -1.
172                                      CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

    To diagonalize  we need  linearly independent eigenvectors of . Otherwise, this

method of computing the exponential does not work and we need to be trickier, but
we will not get into such details. Let  be the matrix with the eigenvectors as columns.
Let 1, 2, . . . ,  be the eigenvalues and let ì1, ì2, . . . , ì be the eigenvectors, then
 = [ ì1 ì2 · · · ì ]. Make a diagonal matrix  with the eigenvalues on the diagonal:

                 1 0 · · · 0             

                  0 2 · · · 0 ..             .
              =          .. . .      ..  
                 . . . .
                         0 · · · 
                   0

We compute

             = [ ì1 ì2 · · · ì ]
                 = [ ì1 ì2 · · · ì ]
                 = [ 1ì1 2ì2 · · · ì ]
                 = [ ì1 ì2 · · · ì ]
                 = .

The columns of  are linearly independent as these are linearly independent eigenvectors
of . Hence  is invertible. Since  = , we multiply on the right by -1 and we get

                    = -1.

This means that  = -1. Multiplying the matrix by , we obtain

                       1 0 · · · 0 
                             2 · · ·               
                       0                        0
             = -1 =   . . .                       .  -1.                              (3.5)
                         ..      ..      ..     ..  
                                                    
                                                   
                         0   0       ···            

The formula (3.5), therefore, gives the formula for computing a fundamental matrix solution
 for the system ì = ì, in the case where we have  linearly independent eigenvectors.

    This computation still works when the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are complex,
though then you have to compute with complex numbers. It is clear from the definition
that if  is real, then  is real. So you will only need complex numbers in the computation
and not for the result. You may need to apply Euler's formula to simplify the result. If
simplified properly, the final matrix will not have any complex numbers in it.

Example 3.8.1: Compute a fundamental matrix solution using the matrix exponential for

the system     1 2 
               =2 1 .

Then compute the particular solution for the initial conditions (0) = 4 and (0) = 2.

Let  be the coefficient matrix         12  . We first compute (exercise) that the eigenvalues
                                       21

are 3 and -1 and corresponding eigenvectors are   1  and   1  . Hence the diagonalization
                                                  1       -1

The initial conditions are (0) = 4 and (0) = 2. Hence, by the property that 0 = , we

find that the particular solution we are looking for is ì where ì is  4  . The particular

3.8.4 Fundamental matrix solutions

If you can compute a fundamental matrix solution in a different way, you can use this to
find the matrix exponential . A fundamental matrix solution of a system of ODEs is not
unique. The exponential is the fundamental matrix solution with the property that for
 = 0 we get the identity matrix. So we must find the right fundamental matrix solution.
Let  be any fundamental matrix solution to ì = ì. We claim

                                               = () [(0)]-1 .

If we plug  = 0 into () [(0)]-1, we get the identity as needed. We can multiply a
fundamental matrix solution on the right by any constant invertible matrix and we still
get a fundamental matrix solution. All we are doing is changing what are the arbitrary
constants in the general solution ì() = () ì.

3.8.5 Approximations

If you think about it, the computation of any fundamental matrix solution  using the
eigenvalue method is just as difficult as the computation of . So perhaps we did not

gain much by this new tool. However, the Taylor series expansion actually gives us a way

to approximate solutions, which the eigenvalue method did not.

The simplest thing we can do is to just compute the series up to a certain number of

terms. There are better ways to approximate the exponential. In many cases, however,

few terms of the Taylor series give a reasonable approximation for the exponential and

may suffice for the application. For example, let us compute the first 4 terms of the series

for the matrix  =  12 .

                   21

   +  + 2 2 + 3 3 =  +  1 2 + 2 2 + 3 6 3 = 5 2 13 7
     2             6     21  2 52                            7 13
                                                             36

                             = 1 +  + 52 2 + 136 3 2  + 2 2 + 73 3 .
                                   2  + 2 2 + 73 3 1 +  + 52 2 + 136 3

Just like the scalar version of the Taylor series approximation, the approximation will be
better for small  and worse for larger . For larger , we will have to compute more terms.
Let us see how we stack up against the real solution with  = 0.1. The approximate solution

is approximately (rounded to 8 decimal places)

                0.1    + 0.1  + 0.12 2 2 + 0.13 6 3 = 1.12716667 0.22233333 0.22233333 1.12716667 .
Plugging  = 0.1 into the real solution (rounded to 8 decimal places), we get

                         0.1  = 1.12734811 0.22251069 0.22251069 1.12734811 .

Not bad at all! Although if we take the same approximation for  = 1, we get

                    +  + 12 2 + 16 3 = 6.66666667 6.33333333 6.33333333 6.66666667 ,

while the real value is (again rounded to 8 decimal places)

                          = 10.22670818 9.85882874 9.85882874 10.22670818 .

So the approximation is not very good once we get up to  = 1. To get a good approximation
at  = 1 (say up to 2 decimal places), we would need to go up to the 11th power (exercise).

3.9 Nonhomogeneous systems

Note: 3 lectures (may have to skip a little), somewhat different from §5.7 in [EP], §7.9 in [BD]

3.9.1 First-order constant-coefficient

Integrating factor

We first focus on the nonhomogeneous first-order equation

                    ì() = ì() + ì(),

where  is a constant matrix. The first method we look at is the integrating factor method.
For simplicity, we rewrite the equation as

                    ì() + ì() = ì(),

where  = -. We multiply both sides of the equation by  (being mindful that we are
dealing with matrices that may not commute) to obtain

                     ì() + ì() =  ì().

We notice that  = . This fact follows by writing down the series definition of :

         =   +  + 1 ()2 + · · · =  + 2 + 1 23 + · · · =
                    2                                      2

                    =  +  + 1 ()2 + · · ·  = .
                                   2

So   =  = . The product rule says

                      ì() =  ì() + ì(),
                    

and so                ì() =  ì().
                    

We can now integrate. That is, we integrate each component of the vector separately

                                                   
                                          ì() =  ì()  + ì.

Recall from Exercise 3.8.7 that ()-1 = -. Therefore, we obtain
                                                  

                                      ì() = -  ì()  + - ì.
178                                             CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

    Perhaps it is better understood as a definite integral. In this case it will be easy to also
solve for the initial conditions. Consider the equation with initial conditions

                                     ì() + ì() = ì(), ì(0) = ì.

The solution can then be written as

                                                                               (3.6)
                        ì() = -  ì()  + -ì.

                                              0

Again, the integration means that each component of the vector  ì() is integrated
separately. It is not hard to see that (3.6) really does satisfy the initial condition ì(0) = ì.

                                           0
                              ì(0) = -0  ì()  + -0ì = ì = ì.

                                                                 0

Example 3.9.1: Suppose that we have the system

                              1 + 51 - 32 =  ,
                               2 + 31 - 2 = 0,

with initial conditions 1(0) = 1, 2(0) = 0.
    Let us write the system as

                        ì + 5 -3 ì =  ,         ì(0) = 1 .
                           3 -1              0            0

The matrix  =  5 -3     has a doubled eigenvalue 2 with defect 1, and we leave it as an
               3 -1
exercise to double-check we computed  correctly. Once we have , we find -, simply

by negating .

      (1 + 3) 2         -3  2                    - (1 - 3) -2 3 -2
     =               2          2 ,              = -3-2 (1 + 3) -2 .
               3        (1 - 3) 

Instead of computing the whole formula at once, let us do it in stages. First

                          (1 + 3) 2             -3  2          
            ì                                                       
                 ()  =                  2                   2
                                     3          (1 - 3)        0

                             0 (1 + 3)  
                        =   3

           =  1
           - 3 + 3 - 2 

Phew!
    Let us check that this really works.

           1 + 51 - 32 = (4-2 - 4-2) + 5(1 - 2) -2 +  - (1 - 6) -2 =  .

Similarly  (exercise)       +  31  -  2  =  0.  The  initial  conditions  are  also  satisfied  (exercise).

                         2

For systems, the integrating factor method only works if  does not depend on , that

is,  is constant. The problem is that in general

                                        ()   ()  ()  ,
                                      

because matrix multiplication is not commutative.

Eigenvector decomposition

For the next method, note that eigenvectors of a matrix give the directions in which the

matrix acts like a scalar. If we solve the system along these directions, the computations

are simpler as we treat the matrix as a scalar. We then put those solutions together to get

the general solution for the system.

Take the equation

                                            ì() = ì() + ì().                                       (3.7)

Assume  has  linearly independent eigenvectors ì1, ì2, . . . , ì. Write

                               ì() = ì1 1() + ì2 2() + · · · + ì ().                               (3.8)

That is, we wish to write our solution as a linear combination of eigenvectors of . If we
solve for the scalar functions 1 through , we have our solution ì. Let us decompose ì in

terms of the eigenvectors as well. We wish to write

                               ì() = ì1 1() + ì2 2() + · · · + ì ().                               (3.9)

That is, we wish to find 1 through  that satisfy (3.9). Since all the eigenvectors are
independent, the matrix  = [ ì1 ì2 · · · ì ] is invertible. Write the equation (3.9) as
180                                                            CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

ì =  ì, where the components of ì are the functions 1 through . Then ì = -1 ì.
Hence it is always possible to find ì when there are  linearly independent eigenvectors.

    We plug (3.8) into (3.7), and note that ì = ì:

     ì                                               ì            ì

ì11 + ì22 + · · · + ì =  ì11 + ì22 + · · · + ì + ì1 1 + ì2 2 + · · · + ì 
                                = ì11 + ì22 + · · · + ì + ì1 1 + ì2 2 + · · · + ì 

                                = ì111 + ì222 + · · · + ì + ì1 1 + ì2 2 + · · · + ì 

                                = ì1(11 + 1) + ì2(22 + 2) + · · · + ì( + ).

If we identify the coefficients of the vectors ì1 through ì, we get the equations

        1 = 11 + 1,
        2 = 22 + 2,

            ..
            .

                                                  =     +   .

        

Each one of these equations is independent of the others. They are all linear first-order

equations and can easily be solved by the standard integrating factor method for single
equations. That is, for the th equation we write

        () - () = ().

We use the integrating factor - to find that

         () - = - ().

We integrate and solve for  to get                   - ()  +   .

                                                
                                   () = 

If we are looking for just any particular solution, we can set  to be zero. If we leave these
constants in, we get the general solution. Write ì() = ì11() + ì22() + · · · + ì(), and
we are done.

    As always, it is perhaps better to write these integrals as definite integrals. Suppose that
we have an initial condition ì(0) = ì. Take ì = -1ì to find ì = ì11 + ì22 + · · · + ì ,
just like before. Then if we write

                                               
                                  () =  -  ()  +   ,

                                                                      0
3.9. NONHOMOGENEOUS SYSTEMS                                                             181

we get the particular solution ì() = ì11() + ì22() + · · · + ì() satisfying ì(0) = ì,
because (0) = .

    We remark that the technique we just outlined is the eigenvalue method applied to
nonhomogeneous systems. If a system is homogeneous, that is, if ì = 0ì, then the equations
we get are  = , and so  =   are the solutions and that is precisely what we
got in § 3.4.

Example 3.9.2: Let  =    13     . Solve ì = ì + ì where ì() =  2   for ì(0) =      -5/16 3/16 .
                         31                                    2

The eigenvalues of  are -2 and 4 and corresponding eigenvectors are             1  and           1
                                                                               -1                1
respectively. This calculation is left as an exercise. We write down the matrix  of the

eigenvectors and compute its inverse (using the inverse formula for 2 × 2 matrices)

                           = 1 1 ,        -1 = 1 1 -1 .
                                  -1 1            21 1

We are looking for a solution of the form ì =     1  1 +    1  2. We first need to write ì
                                                 -1         1
in terms of the eigenvectors. That is we wish to write ì =  2
                                                            2  =    1  1 +     1   2. Thus
                                                                   -1          1

                      1 = -1 2 = 1 1 -1              2 =  -   .
                      2              2 2 1 1         2          +

So 1 =  -  and 2 =  + .
    We further need to write ì(0) in terms of the eigenvectors. That is, we wish to write

ì(0) =   3/16  =   1  1 +    1  2. Hence
        -5/16     -1         1

                                = 1 -1 = 3/16 1/4 .
                                2         -5/16      -1/16

So 1 = 1/4 and 2 = -1/16. We plug our ì into the equation and get

                  ì                  ì                      ì

        1-1 1 + 11 2 =  1-1 1 +  11 2 + 1-1 1 + 11 2
                            = 1-1 (-21) + 11 42 + 1-1 ( - ) + 11 ( + ).

We get the two equations                         where 1(0) = 1 = 1 ,
                                                                           4
                     1 = -21 +  - ,
                     2 = 42 +  + ,               where 2(0) = 2 = -1 .
                                                                           16

exercise to the student. You will need integration by parts.

where 1 is the constant of integration. As 1(0) = 1/4, then 1/4 = 1/3 + 1/4 + 1 and 1 = -1/3.

Similarly,         2 = 4 -4 ( + )  + 24  = -  -  - 1 + 24 .
                                                                     3 4 16

As 2(0) = -1/16, we have -1/16 = -1/3 - 1/16 + 2 and hence 2 = 1/3. The solution is

     ì() = 1        - -2 + 1 - 2 + 1  4 -  4 + 1                   3 4 --2 + 16 3-12
               -1                                 -           = -2 +4 -2 4-5 .
                   3            4  1  3                 16
                                                                   3         + 16

                       1                          2

That is, 1 = 3 4--2 + 16 3-12 and 2 = 3 -2+4-2 + 16 4-5 .

Exercise 3.9.1: Check that 1 and 2 solve the problem. Check both that they satisfy the differential
equation and that they satisfy the initial conditions.

Undetermined coefficients

The method of undetermined coefficients also works for systems. The only difference is that
we use unknown vectors rather than just numbers. Same caveats apply to undetermined
coefficients for systems as for single equations. This method does not always work.
Furthermore, if the right-hand side is complicated, we have to solve for lots of variables.
Each element of an unknown vector is an unknown number. In a system of 3 equations
with say 4 unknown vectors (this would not be uncommon), we already have 12 unknown
numbers to solve for. The method can turn into a lot of tedious work if done by hand. As
the method is essentially the same as for single equations, let us just do an example.

Example 3.9.3: Let  =  -1 0     . Find a particular solution of ì = ì + ì where ì() =  
                       -2 1
                                                                                       .

One can solve this system in an easier way (can you see how?), but for the purposes of the

example, we use the eigenvalue method and undetermined coefficients. The eigenvalues

of  are -1 and 1. Corresponding eigenvectors are     1  and   0  respectively. Hence, our
                                                     1        1

complementary solution is

                                ì = 1 11 - + 2 01  ,

for some arbitrary constants 1 and 2.
    We would next want to guess a particular solution of the form

                                   ì = ì + ì + ì.
3.9. NONHOMOGENEOUS SYSTEMS                                                            183

However, something of the form ì appears in the complementary solution. Because we

do not yet know if the vector ì is a multiple of  0  , we do not know if a conflict arises. It is
                                                  1
possible that there is no conflict, but to be safe we also try ì. Here we find the crux of

the difference between a single equation and systems. We try both terms ì and ì in the

solution, not just the term ì. Therefore, we try

                                   ì = ì + ì + ì + ì.

We have 8 unknowns as ì =  1       , ì =  12 , ì =   1  , and ì =  1  . We plug ì into the
                           2                         2             
                                                                   2

equation. First let us compute ì.

         ì  ì                                 1 + 1  1  1
ì = ì +   +  + ì =                                       +  + .
                                              2 + 2         2         2

Now ì must equal ì + ì, which is

ì + ì = ì + ì + ì + ì + ì

= -1  + -1  + -1  + -1 + 1  + 0 
-21 + 2                    -21 + 2                -21 + 2      -21 + 2 0            1

= -1 + 1  + -1  + -1  + -1 .
-21 + 2                    -21 + 2                -21 + 2 + 1      -21 + 2

We identify the coefficients of , ,  and any constant vectors in ì and in ì + ì to find
the equations:

1 + 1 = -1 + 1,                                          0 = -1,
2 + 2 = -21 + 2,                                         0 = -21 + 2 + 1,
                                                        1 = -1,
      1 = -1,                                           2 = -21 + 2.
      2 = -21 + 2,

We could write the 8 × 9 augmented matrix and do row reduction, but it is easier to solve

these in an ad hoc manner. Immediately, we see 1 = 0, 1 = 0, 1 = 0. Plugging these back
in, we get 2 = -1 and 2 = -1. The remaining equations that tell us something are

                                            1 = -1 + 1,
                                      2 + 2 = -21 + 2.

So 1 = 1/2 and 2 = -1. Finally, 2 can be arbitrary and still satisfy the equations. We are
looking for just a single solution, so presumably the simplest one is when 2 = 0. Therefore,

 ì       ì 1/2  0  0                                        +  0             1 
ì = ì +  + ì +  =                     +            +               =             .
                                                                             2
                                          -1            -1     -1 - -  - 1
                                   0
184                                                            CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

That  is,  1  =  1  ,  2  =  -    -    -  1.  We  add  this  particular  solution  to  the  complementary
                 2

solution to get the general solution of the problem:

                     1 = 1  + 1- and 2 = - -  - 1 + 1- + 2 .
                            2

Notice that both ì and ì really were needed.

Exercise 3.9.2: Check that 1 and 2 solve the problem. Then set 2 = 1 and check this solution as
well. What is the difference between the two solutions (one with 2 = 0 and one with 2 = 1)?

    As you can see, other than the handling of conflicts, undetermined coefficients works
exactly the same as it did for single equations. However, the computations can get out of
hand pretty quickly for systems. The equation we considered was pretty simple.

3.9.2 First-order variable-coefficient

Variation of parameters

Just as for a single equation, there is the method of variation of parameters. For constant-

coefficient systems, it is essentially the same thing as the integrating factor method we

discussed earlier. However, this method works for any linear system, even if it is not

constant-coefficient, provided we somehow solve the associated homogeneous problem.

Consider the equation

                                              ì = () ì + ì().                               (3.10)

Suppose we somehow solved the associated homogeneous equation ì = () ì and found
a fundamental matrix solution (). The general solution to the associated homogeneous
equation is ()ì for a constant vector ì. As in variation of parameters for a single equation,

we try the solution to the nonhomogeneous equation of the form

                                              ì = () ì(),

where ì() is a vector-valued function instead of a constant. We substitute ì into (3.10):
                              () ì() + () ì() = () () ì() + ì().

                                       ì ()                  ( )ì ( )

As () is a fundamental matrix solution to the homogeneous problem, that is, () =

()(), we find                () ì() + () ì() = () ì() + ì().

Hence, () ì() = ì(). We compute [()]-1, and then ì() = [()]-1 ì(). We integrate
to obtain ì, and we have the particular solution ì = () ì(). Hence, we have the formula

                                                   
                                       ì = () [()]-1 ì() .
3.9. NONHOMOGENEOUS SYSTEMS                                                       185

    If  is a constant matrix and () = , then [()]-1 = -. We obtain a solution
ì =  - ì() , which is precisely what we got using the integrating factor method.
Example 3.9.4: Find a particular solution to

                              ì = 2 1  -1 + ì +  (2 + 1 1  1 1).                  (3.11)

Here,      =       1   -1  is most definitely not constant. Perhaps by a lucky guess, we find
                 2+1  1
         1 -     solves () = ()(). Once we know the complementary solution, we
that  =  1

can find a solution to (3.11). First, we compute

                                     [()]-1 = 2 1 1  + . 1 - 1

Next, we know a particular solution to (3.11) is
                                        

                             ì = () [()]-1 ì() 

                                  1 -  1 1                   (2 + 1) 
                           = 1                              1
                               1 -            2 + 1 - 1
                           =
                                  1                 22 
                                              - + 1

                           = 1 -  1            2
                                           -1 3 + 

                                              3

                                  1 4      .
                           =         3
                                  23
                                  3 +

Adding the complementary solution, we find the general solution to (3.11):

                      ì = 1 -  1  1           1 4           2 3 1 - 2 + 13 4 .
                                        +        3  =
                                              23
                                  2 3  +  2 + (1 + 1)  + 3 

Exercise 3.9.3:  Check that 1  =  1  4  and   2  =  2 3 +   really solve (3.11).
                                  3
                                                    3

    In the variation of parameters, as in the integrating factor method, we can obtain the
general solution by adding in constants of integration. Doing so would add ()ì for a
vector ì of arbitrary constants. But that is precisely the complementary solution.

3.9.3 Second-order constant-coefficients

Undetermined coefficients
We have already seen a simple example of the method of undetermined coefficients for
second-order systems in § 3.6. This method is essentially the same as undetermined
186                                        CHAPTER 3. SYSTEMS OF ODES

coefficients for first-order systems. There are some simplifications that we can make, as we
did in § 3.6. Consider the equation

                                                 ì = ì + ì(),

where  is a constant matrix. If ì() is of the form ì0 cos(), then as two derivatives of
cosine is again cosine, we do not need to introduce sines, and we try a solution of the form

                                                 ì = ì cos().

    If ì is a sum of cosines, recall the superposition principle. If ì() = ì0 cos(0) +
ì1 cos(1), then we would try ì cos(0) for the problem ì = ì + ì0 cos(0), and we
would try ì cos(1) for the problem ì = ì + ì1 cos(1). Then we sum the solutions.

    If there is duplication with the complementary solution, or the equation is of the form
ì = ì + ì + ì(), then we need to do the same thing as we do for first-order systems.

    You can never go wrong by putting in more terms than needed into your guess. Those
extra coefficients will turn out to be zero. But it is useful to save some time and effort.

Eigenvector decomposition

If we have the system

                           ì = ì + ì(),

we can do eigenvector decomposition, just like for first-order systems.

    Let 1, 2, . . . ,  be the eigenvalues and ì1, ì2, . . . , ì be eigenvectors. Again form the
matrix  = [ ì1 ì2 · · · ì ]. Write

                       ì() = ì1 1() + ì2 2() + · · · + ì ().

Decompose ì in terms of the eigenvectors

                       ì() = ì1 1() + ì2 2() + · · · + ì (),

where, again, ì = -1 ì.
    We plug in and as before we obtain

     ì                                  ì                     ì

ì11 + ì22 + · · · + ì =  ì11 + ì22 + · · · + ì + ì1 1 + ì2 2 + · · · + ì 
                                 = ì11 + ì22 + · · · + ì + ì1 1 + ì2 2 + · · · + ì 

                                 = ì111 + ì222 + · · · + ì + ì1 1 + ì2 2 + · · · + ì 

                                 = ì1(11 + 1) + ì2(22 + 2) + · · · + ì( + ).
3.9. NONHOMOGENEOUS SYSTEMS                                                          187

We identify the coefficients of the eigenvectors to get the equations

                                   1 = 11 + 1,
                                   2 = 22 + 2,

                                       ..
                                       .

                                       =     +     .

                                   

Each one of these equations is independent of the others. We solve each equation
using the methods of chapter 2. We write ì() = ì11() + ì22() + · · · + ì() to
find a particular solution. If we find the general solutions for 1 through , then
ì() = ì11() + ì2 2() + · · · + ì() is the general solution as well.

Example 3.9.5: Let us do the example from § 3.6 using this method. The equation is

                             ì = -3 1 2 -2 ì + 02 cos(3).

The eigenvalues are -1 and -4, with eigenvectors  1   and   1  . Therefore  =  11    and
                                                  2        -1                  2 -1
-1 = 13
         11    . Therefore,
         2 -1

               1             -1 ì  11 1           0        2   cos(3)
                        =   () =                        = -23          .

               2                   3 2 -1  2 cos(3)         3 cos(3)

So after the whole song and dance of plugging in, the equations we get are

                           1 = -1 + 23 cos(3), 2 = -4 2 - 23 cos(3).

For each equation we use the method of undetermined coefficients. We try 1 cos(3) for
the first equation and 2 cos(3) for the second equation. We plug in to get

                                 -91 cos(3) = -1 cos(3) + 2 cos(3),
                                                                        3

                                 -92 cos(3) = -42 cos(3) - 2 cos(3).
                                                                         3

We solve each of these equations separately. We get -91 = -1 + 2/3 and -92 = -42 - 2/3.
And hence 1 = -1/12 and 2 = 2/15. So our particular solution is

               ì = 1    -1 cos(3) + 1      215 cos(3) = -31/20 /10 cos(3).

Note: 2 lectures, similar to §3.8 in [EP], §10.1 and §11.1 in [BD]

4.1.1 Boundary value problems

Before we tackle the Fourier series, we study the so-called boundary value problems (or
endpoint problems). Consider

                                     +  = 0, () = 0, () = 0,
for some constant , where () is defined for  in the interval [, ]. Previously we specified
the value of the solution and its derivative at a single point. Now we specify the value of
the solution at two different points. As  = 0 is a solution, existence of solutions is not a
problem. Uniqueness of solutions is another issue. The general solution to  +  = 0 has
two arbitrary constants. It is, therefore, natural (but wrong) to believe that requiring two
conditions guarantees a unique solution.
Example 4.1.1: Take  = 1,  = 0,  = . That is,

                                     +  = 0, (0) = 0, () = 0.
Then  = sin  is another solution (besides  = 0) satisfying both boundary conditions.
There are more. Write down the general solution of the differential equation, which is
 =  cos  +  sin . The condition (0) = 0 forces  = 0. Letting () = 0 does not give us
any more information as  =  sin  already satisfies both boundary conditions. Hence,
there are infinitely many solutions of the form  =  sin , where  is an arbitrary constant.
Example 4.1.2: On the other hand, consider  = 2. That is,

                                     + 2 = 0, (0) = 0, () = 0.

     See subsection 0.2.4 on page 13 or Example 2.2.1 on page 85 and Example 2.2.3 on page 88.
190                          CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

                             
Then the general solution is  =  cos 2  +  sin 2  . Letting (0) = 0 still forces
                                                                      
 = 0. We apply the second condition to find 0 = () =  sin 2  . As sin 2   0 we

obtain  = 0. Therefore  = 0 is the unique solution to this problem.

    What is going on? We will be interested in finding which constants  allow a nonzero
solution, and we will be interested in finding those solutions. This problem is an analogue
of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices.

4.1.2 Eigenvalue problems

For basic Fourier series theory, we will need the following three eigenvalue problems:

      +  = 0, () = 0, () = 0,                                           (4.1)

      +  = 0, () = 0, () = 0,                                           (4.2)

and

      +  = 0, () = (), () = ().                                         (4.3)

A number  is called an eigenvalue of (4.1) (resp. (4.2) or (4.3)) if and only if there exists a
nonzero (not identically zero) solution to (4.1) (resp. (4.2) or (4.3)) given that specific . A

nonzero solution is called a corresponding eigenfunction. We will consider more general

equations and boundary conditions, but we will postpone this until chapter 5.

    Note the similarity to eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices. The similarity is not

just coincidental. If we think of the equations as differential operators, then we are doing
the same exact thing. Think of a function () as a vector with infinitely many components
(one for each ). Let  = - 2 2 be the linear operator. Then the eigenvalue/eigenfunction
pair should be  and nonzero  such that  = . In other words, we are looking for
nonzero functions  satisfying certain endpoint conditions that solve ( - ) = 0. A lot of

the formalism from linear algebra still applies here, though we will not pursue this line of

reasoning too far.

Example 4.1.3: Find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of

      +  = 0, (0) = 0, () = 0.

    We have to handle the cases  > 0,  = 0, and  < 0 separately. First suppose that  > 0.
Then the general solution to  +  = 0 is

                             

      =  cos   +  sin   .

The condition (0) = 0 implies immediately  = 0. Next

                                                                  
                                           0 = () =  sin   .

If  is zero, then  is not a nonzero solution. So to get a nonzero solution, we must
have that sin   = 0. Hence,   must be an integer multiple of . In other words,
4.1. BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS                                                                                  191


   =  for a positive integer . Hence, the positive eigenvalues are 2 for all integers

  1. Corresponding eigenfunctions can be taken as  = sin(). Just like for eigenvectors,

constant multiples of an eigenfunction are also eigenfunctions, so we only need to pick one.
    Now suppose that  = 0. In this case the equation is  = 0, and its general solution

is  =  + . The condition (0) = 0 implies that  = 0, and () = 0 implies that  = 0.

This means that  = 0 is not an eigenvalue.
    Finally, suppose that  < 0. In this case we have the general solution

                                                                       

                                 =  cosh -  +  sinh -  .

Letting (0) =0 implies that  = 0 (recall cosh 0 = 1 and sinh 0 = 0). So our solution must
be  =  sinh -  and satisfy () = 0. This is only possible if  is zero. Why? Because

sinh  is only zero when  = 0. You should plot sinh to see this fact. We can also see this

from the definition of sinh.    We get 0     =       sinh    =    - -      Hence          =    -, which implies

                                                                  2.
 = - and that is only true if  = 0. So there are no negative eigenvalues.

In summary, the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions are

      = 2 with an eigenfunction  = sin() for all integers   1.

Example 4.1.4: Compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
                                    +  = 0, (0) = 0, () = 0.

    Again we have to handle the cases  > 0,  = 0,  <0 separately. First suppose that
 > 0. The general solution to  +  = 0 is  =  cos   +  sin   . So

                                                                           
                              = -  sin   +   cos   .

The condition (0) = 0 implies immediately  = 0. Next

                                                                   
                                  0 = () = -  sin   .

                                                                                                            
Again  cannot be zero if  is to be an eigenvalue, and sin   is only zero if  = 

for a positive integer . Hence, the positive eigenvalues are again 2 for all integers   1.

And the corresponding eigenfunctions can be taken as  = cos().

Now suppose that  = 0. In this case, the equation is  = 0 and the general solution is

 =  +  so  = . The condition (0) = 0 implies that  = 0. The condition () = 0

also implies  = 0. Hence  could be anything (let us take it to be 1). So  = 0 is an

eigenvalue and  = 1 is a corresponding eigenfunction.                                                       

Finally, let  < 0. In this case, the general solution is  =  cosh -  +  sinh - 

and                                                                          

                         =  - sinh -  +  - cosh -  .

Recall  that  cosh   =  1 (  +   - )  and  sinh   =  1 (  -  - ).  As  an  exercise  try  the  computation  with  the
                                           
                        2                            2
general solution written as  =  -  + - -  (for different  and  of course).
192                               CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

We have already seen (with roles of  and  switched) that for this expression to be zero at
 = 0 and  = , we must have  =  = 0. Hence, there are no negative eigenvalues.

    In summary, the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions are

         = 2 with an eigenfunction  = cos() for all integers   1,

and there is another eigenvalue                                0 = 1.
                             0 = 0 with an eigenfunction

    The following problem is the one that leads to the general Fourier series.
Example 4.1.5: Compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of

                             +  = 0, (-) = (), (-) = ().

We have not specified the values or the derivatives at the endpoints, but rather that they

are the same at the beginning and at the end of the interval.

We skip  < 0. The computations are the same as before, and again we find that there

are no negative eigenvalues.

For  = 0, the general solution is  =  + . The condition (-) = () implies

that  = 0 ( +  = - +  implies  = 0). The second condition (-) = () says

nothing about  and hence  = 0 is an eigenvalue with a corresponding eigenfunction

 = 1.                             

For  > 0 we get that  =  cos   +  sin   . Now

                                                                       

        cos -   +  sin -   =  cos   +  sin   .

         (-)                                              ()

We remember that cos(-) = cos() and sin(-) = - sin(). Therefore,

                                                                 

        cos   -  sin   =  cos   +  sin   .

         
Hence either  = 0 or sin   = 0. Similarly (exercise) if we differentiate  and plug in
                                  
the second condition we find that  = 0 or sin   = 0. Therefore, unless we want 
                                                                                
and  to both be zero (which we do not) we must have sin   = 0. Hence,  is an

integer and the eigenvalues are yet again  = 2 for an integer   1. In this case, however,

 =  cos() +  sin() is an eigenfunction for any  and any . So we have two linearly

independent eigenfunctions sin() and cos(). Remember that for a matrix, we can also

have two eigenvectors corresponding to a single eigenvalue if the eigenvalue is repeated.

In summary, the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions are

 = 2   with eigenfunctions      cos() and sin()                  for all integers   1,
0 = 0  with an eigenfunction    0 = 1.

4.1.3 Orthogonality of eigenfunctions

Something that will be very useful in the next section is the orthogonality property of the
eigenfunctions. This is an analogue of the following fact about eigenvectors of a matrix. A
matrix is called symmetric if  =  (it is equal to its transpose). Eigenvectors for two distinct
eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are orthogonal. The differential operators we are dealing
with act much like a symmetric matrix. We, therefore, get the following theorem.

Theorem 4.1.1. Suppose that 1() and 2() are two eigenfunctions of the problem (4.1), (4.2), or
(4.3) for two different eigenvalues 1 and 2. Then they are orthogonal in the sense that

                                           
                                                   1()2()  = 0.

                                                                

    The terminology comes from the fact that the integral is a type of inner product. We will
expand on this in the next section. The theorem has a very short, elegant, and illuminating
proof so we give it here. First, we have the following two equations.

                                1 + 11 = 0 and 2 + 22 = 0.
Multiply the first by 2 and the second by 1 and subtract to get

                                        (1 - 2)12 = 21 - 21 .

Integrate both sides of the equation:

                                       

(1 - 2) 1()2()  =                        2()1() - 2()1() 
                                       
                                       
                                       =  2 ()1() - 2()1 () 
                                        

                                                                                     

                                       = 2 ()1() - 2()1 ()  = = 0.

The last equality holds because of the boundary conditions. For example, if we consider
(4.1) we have 1() = 1() = 2() = 2() = 0 and so 21 - 21 is zero at both  and .
As 1  2, the theorem follows.

Exercise 4.1.1 (easy): Finish the proof of the theorem (check the last equality in the proof) for the
cases (4.2) and (4.3).

    The function sin() is an eigenfunction for the problem  +  = 0, (0) = 0, () = 0.
Hence for positive integers  and , we have the integrals

                                          when   .
     sin() sin()  = 0,

  0
194                               CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

Similarly, still assuming that  and  are positive integers,    
                                                                    cos()  = 0.
               cos() cos()  = 0, when   , and
                                                                 0
               0

Finally, we also get                                           

                                  when   ,    and                   sin()  = 0,
               sin() sin()  = 0,  when   ,
                                                                 -

               -                                               -

and  

                            cos() sin()  = 0  (even if  = ).

4.1.4 Fredholm alternative

We now touch on a very useful theorem in the theory of differential equations. The theorem
holds in a more general setting than we are going to state it, but for our purposes the
following statement is sufficient. We will give a slightly more general version in chapter 5.

Theorem 4.1.2 (Fredholm alternative). Exactly one of the following statements holds. Either

                             +  = 0, () = 0, () = 0                              (4.4)

has a nonzero solution, or

                             +  =  (), () = 0, () = 0                            (4.5)

has a unique solution for every function  continuous on [, ].

    The theorem is also true for the other types of boundary conditions we considered. The
theorem means that if  is not an eigenvalue, the nonhomogeneous equation (4.5) has a
unique solution for every right-hand side. On the other hand if  is an eigenvalue, then
(4.5) need not have a solution for every  , and furthermore, even if it happens to have a
solution, the solution is not unique.

    We also want to reinforce the idea here that linear differential operators have much
in common with matrices. So it is no surprise that there is a finite-dimensional version
of Fredholm alternative for matrices as well. Let  be an  ×  matrix. The Fredholm
alternative then states that either ( - )ì = 0ì has a nontrivial solution, or ( - )ì = ì
has a unique solution for every ì.

    A lot of intuition from linear algebra can be applied to linear differential operators, but
one must be careful of course. For example, one difference we have already seen is that in
general a differential operator will have infinitely many eigenvalues, while a matrix has
only finitely many.

4.1.5 Application

Let us consider a physical application of an endpoint problem. Suppose we have a tightly
stretched quickly spinning elastic string or rope of uniform linear density , for example in
kg/m. Let us put this problem into the  -plane and both  and  are in meters. The -axis
represents the position on the string. The string rotates at angular velocity , in radians/s.
Imagine that the whole -plane rotates at angular velocity . This way, the string stays in
this  -plane and  measures its deflection from the equilibrium position,  = 0, on the
-axis. Hence the graph of  gives the shape of the string. We consider an ideal string with
no volume, just a mathematical curve. We suppose the tension on the string is a constant 
in Newtons. Assuming that the deflection is small, we can use Newton's second law (let us
skip the derivation) to get the equation

                                                  + 2 = 0.

To check the units notice that the units of  are m/m2, as the derivative is in terms of .
    Let  be the length of the string (in meters) and the string is fixed at the beginning and

end points. Hence, (0) = 0 and () = 0. See Figure 4.1.

    

                              

    0                                       

       Figure 4.1: Whirling string.

    We rewrite the equation as  +  2  = 0. The setup is similar to Example 4.1.3

on page 190, except for the interval length being  instead of . We are looking for

eigenvalues of  +  = 0, (0) = 0, () = 0 where  =  2 . As before there are

no nonpositive eigenvalues. With  > 0, the general solution to the equation is  =
 cos   +  sin   . The condition (0) = 0 implies that  = 0 as before. The
                                          
condition () = 0 implies that sin   = 0 and hence   =  for some integer  > 0,

so     2

                                  22
                              ==       .
                                  
                                    2

    What does this say about the shape of the string? It says that for all parameters , , 
not satisfying the equation above, the string is in the equilibrium position,  = 0. When

2 22

  = 2 , then the string will "pop out" some distance . We cannot compute  with the

information we have.

Let us assume that  and  are fixed and we are changing . For most values of , the
                                                                                                 ,
string  is  in  the  equilibrium  state.  When  the  angular  velocity    hits  a  value    =       then
                                                                                               
the string pops out and has the shape of a sin wave crossing the -axis  - 1 times between

the end points. For example, at  = 1, the string does not cross the -axis and the shape

looks like in Figure 4.1 on the previous page. On the other hand, when  = 3 the string

crosses the -axis 2 times, see Figure 4.2. When  changes again, the string returns to the

equilibrium position. The higher the angular velocity, the more times it crosses the -axis

when it is popped out.

                     

                     0                                                    

                     Figure 4.2: Whirling string at the third eigenvalue ( = 3).

    For another example, if you have a spinning jump rope (then  = 1 as it is completely
"popped out") and you pull on the ends to increase the tension, then the velocity also
increases for the rope to stay "popped out".

4.2 The trigonometric series

Note: 2 lectures, §9.1 in [EP], §10.2 in [BD]

4.2.1 Periodic functions and motivation

As motivation for studying Fourier series, consider the problem

      + 20 =  (),                                                           (4.6)

for some periodic function  (). In § 2.6, we found the general solution to

      + 20 = 0 cos().                                                       (4.7)

One way to solve (4.6) is to decompose  () as a sum of cosines (and sines) and then solve

many problems of the form (4.7). We then use the principle of superposition, to sum up all

the solutions we got to get a solution to (4.6).

    Before we proceed, let us talk a little bit more in detail about periodic functions. A
function is said to be periodic with period  if  () =  ( + ) for all . For brevity we say
 () is -periodic. Note that a -periodic function is also 2-periodic, 3-periodic and
so on. For example, cos() and sin() are 2-periodic. So are cos() and sin() for all
integers . The constant functions are an extreme example. They are periodic for any

period (exercise).
    Normally we start with a function  () defined on some interval [-, ], and we want to

extend  () periodically to make it a 2-periodic function. We do this extension by defining
a new function () such that for  in [-, ], () =  (). For  in [, 3], we define
() =  ( - 2), for  in [-3, -], () =  ( + 2), and so on. To make that work we
needed  (-) =  (). We could have also started with  defined only on the half-open
interval (-, ] and then define  (-) =  ().

Example 4.2.1: Define  () = 1 - 2 on [-1, 1]. Extend  () periodically to a 2-periodic
function. For 1    3, we get  () = 1 - ( - 2)2. For -3    1, we get  () = 1 - ( + 2)2.
For 3    5, we get  () = 1 - ( - 4)2. And so on. See Figure 4.3 on the next page.

    You should be careful to distinguish between  () and its extension. A common mistake
is to assume that a formula for  () holds for its extension. It can be confusing when the
formula for  () is periodic, but with perhaps a different period.

Exercise 4.2.1: Define  () = cos  on [-/2, /2]. Take the -periodic extension and sketch its
graph. How does it compare to the graph of cos ?

4.2.2 Inner product and eigenvector decomposition

Suppose  is a symmetric matrix, that is,  = . As we remarked before, eigenvectors of 
are then orthogonal. Here the word orthogonal means that if ì and ì are two eigenvectors

of  for distinct eigenvalues, then ì, ì  = 0. In this case, the inner product ì, ì  is the
dot product, which can be computed as ìì .

    To decompose a vector ì in terms of mutually orthogonal vectors ì1 and ì2, we write

                                     ì = 1ì1 + 2ì2.

Let us find the formula for 1 and 2. We compute,

            ì, ì1 = 1ì1 + 2ì2, ì1 = 1ì1, ì1 + 2 ì2, ì1 = 1ì1, ì1.

                                                          =0

Therefore,                           1 = ì, ì1 .
                                           ì1, ì1

Similarly,

                                     2 = ì, ì2 .
                                           ì2, ì2

You probably remember this formula from vector calculus.

Example 4.2.2: Write ì =      2  as a linear combination of ì1 =      1    and ì2 =  1.
                              3                                      -1
Note that ì1 and ì2 are orthogonal as ì1, ì2 = 1(1) + (-1)1 = 0. Then                1

                          1 = ì, ì1 = 2(1) + 3(-1) = -1 ,
                                ì1, ì1 1(1) + (-1)(-1) 2

                          2 = ì, ì2 = 2 + 3 = 5 .
                                ì2, ì2 1 + 1 2

Hence,

                                     2 = -1 1 + 5 1 .

4.2.3 The trigonometric series

Instead of decomposing a vector in terms of eigenvectors of a matrix, we decompose
a function in terms of eigenfunctions of a certain eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalue
problem we use for the Fourier series is

                             +  = 0, (-) = (), (-) = ().

We computed that eigenfunctions are 1, cos(), sin(). That is, we want to find a
representation of a 2-periodic function  () as

                                     

                       0
                () = +  cos() +  sin()

                        2 =1
                    = 0 + 1 cos() + 1 sin() + 2 cos(2) + 2 sin(2) + · · ·

                        2

This series is called the Fourier series or the trigonometric series for  (). The term

 cos() +  sin() is sometimes called the th harmonic. We write the coefficient of the
                      0
eigenfunction  1  as  2  for  convenience.  We  could  also  think  of  1  =  cos(0),  so  that  we  only

need to look at cos() and sin().

As for matrices, we want to find a projection of  () onto the subspaces given by the

eigenfunctions. So we want to define an inner product of functions. For example, to find ,

we want to compute   () , cos() . We define the inner product as

                                            def  

                                () , ()  =              () () .

                                                 -

With this inner product, we saw in the previous section that the eigenfunctions cos()
(including the constant eigenfunction), and sin() are orthogonal, that is,

                          cos() , cos()  = 0           for   ,
                          sin() , sin()  = 0           for   ,
                          sin() , cos()  = 0           for all  and .

For  = 1, 2, 3, . . ., we have
                                                     

                            cos() , cos()  = cos() cos()  = ,

                                                                              -

                                                     
                             sin() , sin()  = sin() sin()  = ,

                                                                              -

by elementary calculus. For the constant, we get
                                                   

                                          1 , 1  = 1 · 1  = 2.

                                                                            -

     Named after the French mathematician Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830).

The coefficients are given by

                    () ,  = cos()  = 1    () cos() ,
                        cos() , cos()           -

                        sin() , sin()   -

Compare these expressions with the finite-dimensional example. For 0, we get a similar

formula                                 () , 1  1  

                               0 = 2       =            () .
                                       1 , 1   -

Let us check the formulas via the orthogonality properties. Suppose for a moment that

                                             

                               0
                        () = +  cos() +  sin().

                                2 =1

Then for   1, we have

  () , cos()  =                

                     0
                        +  cos() +  sin() , cos()

                     2 =1

                                               

            0
         =  1 , cos()  +  cos() , cos()  +  sin() , cos() 

            2 =1

         =  cos() , cos() .

Hence,  =  cos() , cos()    () , cos()  .
Exercise 4.2.2: Carry out the calculation for 0 and .

Example 4.2.3: Take the function

                                            () = 

for  in (-, ]. Extend  () periodically and write it as a Fourier series. This function is

called the sawtooth, and it finds many applications, for example, in electronic music.

The plot of the extended periodic function is given in Figure 4.4 on the following page.

Let us compute the coefficients. We start with 0,

                                      0 =  1     = 0.

                                            -

We will often use the result from calculus that says that the integral of an odd function
over a symmetric interval is zero. Recall that an odd function is a function () such that
(-) = -(). For example the functions , sin , or (importantly for us)  cos() are all

odd functions. Thus             = 1    cos()  = 0.

We move to . Another useful fact from calculus is that the integral of an even function

over a symmetric interval is twice the integral of the same function over half the interval.

An even function is a function () such that (-) = (). For example,  sin() is even.
                    = 1    sin() 
                                -
                                 
                               = 2   sin() 
                               0
                                                    
                               = 2 - cos() + 1 cos() 
                                             =0  0

                               = 2 - cos()   + 0

                               = -2 cos() = 2 (-1)+1 .
                                                  

We have used that

                               cos() = (-1) = 1 if  even,
                                                         -1 if  odd.

The series, therefore, is               2 (-1)+1 sin().
                                                

                                       =1

More explicitly, the first 3 harmonics of the series for  () are

                                     2 sin() - sin(2) + 2 sin(3) + · · ·

Extend  () periodically and write it as a Fourier series. This function or its variants appear
often in applications and the function is called the square wave. It is a signal generated by
simply periodically flipping a switch on or off.

    We have so far skirted the issue of convergence. For example, if  () is the square wave
function, the equation

                              2
 () = +                            2 - 1 sin (2 - 1)  .
        2                      =1

is only an equality for such  where  () is continuous. We do not get an equality for
 = -, 0,  and all the other discontinuities of  (). It is not hard to see that when  is an
integer multiple of  (which gives all the discontinuities), then sin (2 - 1)  = 0 and so

 2 
2 + 2 - 1 sin (2 - 1)  = 2 .

        =1

We redefine  () on [-, ] as

        0                      if - <  < 0,
                               if 0 <  < ,
 () =                          if  = -,  = 0, or  = ,
        
         /2

and extend periodically. The series equals this new extended  () everywhere, including
the discontinuities. We will generally not worry about changing the function values at
several (finitely many) points.

    We will say more about convergence in the next section. Roughly speaking, if  () is a
nice enough function then the series converges to  () wherever  () is continuous. Let us,
however, briefly mention an effect of the discontinuity. Zoom in near the discontinuity in
the square wave. Further, plot the first 100 harmonics, see Figure 4.8 on the following page.
While the series is a very good approximation away from the discontinuities, the error (the
overshoot) near the discontinuity at  =  does not seem to be getting any smaller as we
take more and more harmonics. This behavior is known as the Gibbs phenomenon. The
region where the error is large does get smaller, however, the more terms in the series we
take.

    We can think of a periodic function as a "signal" that is a superposition of many signals
of pure frequency. For example, we could think of the square wave as a tone of certain base
frequency coming through the speaker of your computer. This base frequency is called the
fundamental frequency and that is the "musical note" that you identify this sound as. But the
square wave will also be a superposition of many different pure tones of frequencies that
are multiples of the fundamental frequency. In music, the higher frequencies are called
the overtones. All the frequencies that appear are called the spectrum of the signal. On the
other hand, if the signal were a simple sine wave instead of the square wave, then it is only
the pure tone of fundamental frequency (no overtones). The simplest way to make sound
using a computer is the square wave, and the sound is very different from a pure tone. If
you ever played video games from the 1980s or so, then you heard what square waves
sound like.

    There is another form of the Fourier series using complex exponentials  for  =

to work with sometimes. It is certainly more compact to write, and there is only one
formula for the coefficients. On the downside, the coefficients are complex numbers.

4.3 More on the Fourier series

Note: 2 lectures, §9.2-§9.3 in [EP], §10.3 in [BD]

4.3.1 2-periodic functions

We computed the Fourier series for a 2-periodic function, but what about functions of

different periods. Well, fear not, the computation is a simple case of change of variables.

We just rescale the independent axis. Consider a 2-periodic function  (). The  is called

the  half  period.  Let    =  .   Then    the  function

                              

                                                  () =   
                                                               

is 2-periodic and we know what to do with it. We must also rescale all our sines and
                                       
cosines.   In  the  series,   we  use     as  the  variable.  That  is,  we  want  to  write
                                       

                                       0                                     

                               () = +      =1      cos   +  sin   .
                                       2

If we change variables to , we see that

                                                        

                                           0
                                  () = +  cos() +  sin().

                                           2 =1

We compute  and  as before. After we write down the integrals, we change variables

from    back   to   ,  noting  also  that      =     .

    The two most common half periods that show up in examples are  and 1 because of

the simplicity of the formulas. We should stress that we have done no new mathematics,
we have only changed variables. If you understand the Fourier series for 2-periodic
functions, you understand it for 2-periodic functions. You can think of it as just using

different units for time. All that we are doing is moving some constants around, but all the

mathematics is the same.

First, we recognize that  is 2-periodic and so  = 1. We want to write  () =
20 +  
      =1     cos()  +         sin().  We  start  with    for       1.  We       note  that  ||  cos()  is

even and for 0    1,  () = || = . Hence,

              =  () cos()

             = 2 sin() - 2                0 
                    
                                  =0

Next we find 0:                             1

                                                 -1

You should be able to find this integral by thinking about the integral as the area under the
graph without doing any computation at all. Finally, we find . Notice that || sin() is

odd, and so                             1

The plot of these few terms and also a plot up to the 20th harmonic is given in Figure 4.10.
You should notice how close the graph is to the real function. You should also notice that
there is no "Gibbs phenomenon" present as there are no discontinuities.

4.3.2 Convergence

We will need the one sided limits of functions. We will use the following notation

                       (-) = lim  (), and  (+) = lim  ().
                                                        

If you are unfamiliar with this notation, lim  () means we are taking a limit of  () as 
approaches  from below (i.e.  < ) and lim  () means we are taking a limit of  () as 
approaches  from above (i.e.  > ). For example, for the square wave function

                          () = 0 if (4.8) - <   0,
                                    if 0 <   ,

we have  (0-) = 0 and  (0+) = .
4.3. MORE ON THE FOURIER SERIES                                                                      211

    Let  () be a function defined on an interval [, ]. Suppose that we find finitely many
points  = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,  =  in the interval, such that  () is continuous on the intervals
(0, 1), (1, 2), . . . , (-1, ). Also suppose that all the one sided limits exist, that is, all of
 (0+),  (1-),  (1+),  (2-),  (2+), . . . ,  (-) exist and are finite. Then we say  () is

piecewise continuous.
    If moreover,  () is differentiable at all but finitely many points, and  () is piecewise

continuous, then  () is said to be piecewise smooth.

Example 4.3.2: The square wave function, (4.8) extended periodically, is piecewise smooth
on [-, ] or any other finite interval, so we just say that  () is piecewise smooth without

mentioning an interval.

Example 4.3.3: The function  () = || is piecewise smooth.

Example 4.3.4:  The   function      ()  =  1  is  not  piecewise  smooth      on  [-1, 1]  (or  any  other
                                           

interval containing zero). In fact, it is not even piecewise continuous.
Example 4.3.5: The function  () = 3  is not piecewise smooth on [-1, 1] (or any other

interval  containing  zero).  The  function    ()  is  continuous,  but  its  derivative    ()  =    1     is

unbounded near zero and hence not piecewise continuous.                                            32/3 ,

    Piecewise smooth functions have an easy answer on the convergence of the Fourier
series.

Theorem 4.3.1. Suppose  () is a 2-periodic piecewise smooth function. Let

                              0                                     

                              2 +  cos   +  sin  
                                    =1

be the Fourier series for  (). Then the series converges for all . If  () is continuous at , then

                                 0                                  

                       () = +           =1   cos   +  sin   .
                               2

Otherwise,       (-) +  (+) = 0  +    cos   +    sin   .
                       2 2 =1  

                                                                   (-)+  (+)

    If we happen to have that  () = 2 at all the discontinuities, the Fourier series
converges to  () everywhere. We can always just redefine  () by changing the value at
each discontinuity appropriately. Then we can write an equals sign between  () and the
series without any worry. We mentioned this fact briefly at the end last section.

    The theorem does not say how fast the series converges. Think back to the discussion
of the Gibbs phenomenon in the last section. The closer you get to the discontinuity, the
more terms you need to take to get an accurate approximation to the function.

4.3.3 Differentiation and integration of Fourier series

Not only does Fourier series converge nicely, but it is easy to differentiate and integrate the
series. We can do this just by differentiating or integrating term by term.

Theorem 4.3.2. Suppose

                               0                                           

                           () = +      =1   cos   +  sin  
                                   2

is a piecewise smooth continuous function and the derivative  () is piecewise smooth. Then the

derivative can be obtained by differentiating term by term,

                                   -                                       

                   () =                 sin   +  cos   .

                               =1

    It is important that the function is continuous. It can have corners, but no jumps.
Otherwise, the differentiated series will fail to converge. For an exercise, take the series
obtained for the square wave and try to differentiate the series. Similarly to differentiation,
integration of Fourier series is also done term by term.

Theorem 4.3.3. Suppose

                               0                                           

                           () = +      =1   cos   +  sin  
                                   2

is a piecewise smooth function. Then the antiderivative is obtained by antidifferentiating term by

term and so               0                            -                       

                  () = +  +            =1   sin   +  cos   ,
                            2

where () =  () and  is an arbitrary constant.

Note  that   the  series  for  ()  is  no  longer  a  Fourier  series  as  it  contains  the  0   term.  The
                                                                                               2

antiderivative of a periodic function need no longer be periodic and so we should not

expect a Fourier series. Unless, of course, 0 = 0.

4.3.4 Rates of convergence and smoothness

We consider an example of a periodic function differentiable once but not twice.
Example 4.3.6: Take the function

                                       () = ( + 1)  if -1 <   0,
                                                 (1 - )  if 0 <   1,

and extend to a 2-periodic function. The derivative  () exists for all , but  () does not
exist if  is an integer. In particular,  () = 2 + 1 if -1    0 and  () = 1 - 2 if 0    1,
so  () has a "corner" at 0. See Figure 4.11 on the next page for the plot of  () and  ().

Exercise 4.3.1: Compute  (0+) and  (0-).

Let us compute the Fourier-series coefficients. The actual computation involves several

integrations by parts and is left to the reader.

         1                0                       1

     0 =  ()  = ( + 1)   + (1 - )   = 0,

         -1               -1              0       0                  1
         1

      =  () cos()  = ( + 1)  cos()  + (1 - )  cos()  = 0,

         -1                               -1                         1    0
         1                                0

      =  () sin()  = ( + 1)  sin()  + (1 - )  sin() 

         -1                               -1                         0

                                8         if  is odd,
         4(1 - (-1) ) 33                  if  is even.
         = 33 = 0

That is, the series is                          

                                                    33 8 sin().

                                               =1
                                               odd

This series converges very fast. If we plot up to the third harmonic, that is,

                                          3 8 sin() + 273 8 sin(3),

the plot is almost indistinguishable from the plot of  () in Figure 4.11. In fact, the coefficient

  8  is  already  just  0.0096  (approximately).        The  reason  for  this        behavior  is  the  3  term  in
273
the denominator. The coefficients  in this case go to zero as fast as 1/3 goes to zero.

    For functions constructed piecewise from polynomials as above, it is generally true that
if you have one derivative but not two derivatives, the Fourier coefficients will go to zero

approximately like 1/3. If you have only a continuous function that is not differentiable,
then the Fourier coefficients will go to zero as 1/2. If you have discontinuities, then the
Fourier coefficients will go to zero approximately as 1/. For more general functions the
story is somewhat more complicated but the same idea holds, the more derivatives you
have, the faster the coefficients go to zero. Similar reasoning works in reverse. If the
coefficients go to zero like 1/2 (or faster), you always obtain a continuous function. If they
go to zero like 1/3 (or faster), you obtain an everywhere differentiable function.

    To justify this behavior, take for example the function defined by the Fourier series

                                                                           

                                              () = 31 sin().

                                                                          =1

When we differentiate term by term, we notice

                                                                            

                                              () = 21 cos().

                                                                          =1

Therefore, the coefficients now go down like 1/2, which means that we have a continuous
function. The derivative of  () is defined at most points, but there are points where  ()
is not differentiable. It has corners, but no jumps. If we differentiate again (where we can),
we find that the function  (), now fails to be continuous (has jumps)

                                                         -1
                                              () =  sin().

                                                                           =1

This function is similar to the sawtooth. If we tried to differentiate the series again, we
would obtain 

                                                       - cos(),

                                                                     =1

which does not converge!

Exercise 4.3.2: Use a computer to plot the series we obtained for  (),  () and  (). That is,
plot say the first 5 harmonics of the functions. At what points does  () have the discontinuities?

4.4 Sine and cosine series

Note: 2 lectures, §9.3 in [EP], §10.4 in [BD]

4.4.1 Odd and even periodic functions

You may have noticed by now that an odd function has no cosine terms in the Fourier
series and an even function has no sine terms in the Fourier series. This observation is not
a coincidence. Let us look at even and odd periodic functions in more detail.

    Recall that a function  () is odd if  (-) = -  (). A function  () is even if  (-) =  ().
For example, cos() is even and sin() is odd. Similarly the function  is even if  is even
and odd if  is odd.

Exercise 4.4.1: Take two functions  () and () and define their product () =  ()().

   a) Suppose both  () and () are odd. Is () odd or even?

   b) Suppose one is even and one is odd. Is () odd or even?

   c) Suppose both are even. Is () odd or even?

    If  () and () are both odd, then  () + () is odd. Similarly for even functions. On
the other hand, if  () is odd and () even, then we cannot say anything about the sum
 () + (). In fact, the Fourier series of any function is a sum of an odd (the sine terms)
and an even (the cosine terms) function.

    In this section, we consider odd and even periodic functions. We have previously
defined the 2-periodic extension of a function defined on the interval [-, ]. Sometimes
we are only interested in the function on the range [0, ], and it would be convenient to have
an odd (resp. even) function. If the function is odd (resp. even), all the cosine (resp. sine)
terms disappear. What we will do is take the odd (resp. even) extension of the function to
[-, ] and then extend periodically to a 2-periodic function.

    Take a function  () defined on [0, ]. On (-, ] define the functions

                   def   () if 0    ,
                        -  (-) if - <  < 0,
     odd() =
                         () if 0    ,
                   def   (-) if - <  < 0.

     even() =

Extend odd() and even() to be 2-periodic. Then odd() is called the odd periodic extension
of  (), and even() is called the even periodic extension of  (). For the odd extension, we
generally assume that  (0) =  () = 0.

Exercise 4.4.2: Check that odd() is odd and even() is even. For odd, assume  (0) =  () = 0.

Example 4.4.1: Take the function  () =  (1 - ) defined on [0, 1]. Figure 4.12 on the next
page shows the plots of the odd and even periodic extensions of  ().

4.4.2 Sine and cosine series

Let  () be an odd 2-periodic function. We write the Fourier series for  (). First, we
compute the coefficients  (including  = 0) and get

                        = 1    () cos    = 0.
                              -                              

That is, the Fourier series of an odd function has no cosine terms. The integral is zero as

 () cos () is an odd function (product of an odd and an even function is odd) and the
                                                                                      
integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. The function  () sin
                                                                                      

is even as it is the product of two odd functions. The integral of an even function over a
symmetric interval [-, ] is twice the integral of the function over the interval [0, ]. So

               = 1    () sin    = 2    () sin   .
               -                                             0       

The Fourier series of an odd  () is then

                               
                                   sin   .

                              =1

      Similarly, if  () is an even 2-periodic function. For the same exact reasons as above,

we find that  = 0 and   = 2    () cos   .

                             0                                 

The formula still works for  = 0, in which case it becomes

                                     
                             0 = 2  () .

                                   0
220                                        CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

The Fourier series of an even  () is then

                              0                  

                              2 +  cos   .
                                 =1

    An interesting consequence is that the coefficients of the Fourier series of an odd (or
even) function can be computed by just integrating over the half interval [0, ]. Therefore,

we can compute the Fourier series of the odd (or even) extension of a function by computing

certain integrals over the interval where the original function is defined.

Theorem 4.4.1. Let  () be a piecewise smooth function defined on [0, ]. Then the odd periodic
extension of  () has the Fourier series

                                  
                    odd() =  sin   ,

                                    =1

where                = 2    () sin   .

                              0                  

The even periodic extension of  () has the Fourier series

                                 0                           

                    even() = 2 +  cos   ,
                                           =1

where                = 2    () cos   .

                              0                            

We call the series  =1   sin     the       sine  series      of   ()  and  we  call  the  series  0  +
                                                                                                  2
=1   cos                       

             the cosine series of  (). We often do not actually care what happens

outside of [0, ]. We simply pick whichever series fits our problem better.

    It is not necessary to start with the full Fourier series to obtain the sine and cosine series.

The sine series is really the eigenfunction expansion of  () using eigenfunctions of the
eigenvalue problem  +  = 0, (0) = 0, () = 0. The cosine series is the eigenfunction
expansion of  () using eigenfunctions of the eigenvalue problem  +  = 0, (0) = 0,
() = 0. We would, therefore, get the same formulas by defining the inner product

                                     
                      (), () =  ()() ,

                                           0

and following the procedure of § 4.2. This point of view is useful, as we commonly use
a specific series that arose because our underlying question led to a certain eigenvalue

problem. If the eigenvalue problem is not one of the three we covered so far, you can still
do an eigenfunction expansion, generalizing the results of this chapter. We will deal with
such a generalization in chapter 5.

where                                 2 0 = 2    = 22 ,

and

             = 2 2   cos()  = 2 2 1  sin() - 4    sin() 
                 0                                            0  0
                                                 
                 = 24  cos()  + 24                                            
                                                   cos()  = 2 4(-1) .

Note  that  we  "detected"    the  continuity  of  the  extension  since  the   coefficients  decay  as  1

                                                                                                         2 .

That is, the even periodic extension of 2 has no jump discontinuities. It does have corners,

since the derivative, which is an odd function and a sine series, has jumps; it has a Fourier

series  whose   coefficients  decay  only  as  1.

                                               

Explicitly, the first few terms of the series for  () are

                               - 4 cos( 2 ) + cos(2) - 4 cos(3) + · · ·

Exercise 4.4.3:

a) Compute the derivative of the even periodic extension of  () above and verify it has jump
   discontinuities. Use the actual definition of  (), not its cosine series!

b) Why is it that the derivative of the even periodic extension of  () is the odd periodic extension
   of  ()?

4.4.3 Application

Fourier series ties in to the boundary value problems that we studied earlier. Consider the
boundary value problem

                                     () +  () =  (), 0 <  < ,

with the Dirichlet boundary conditions (0) = 0, () = 0. The Fredholm alternative
(Theorem 4.1.2 on page 194) says that as long as  is not an eigenvalue of the underlying
222                                    CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

homogeneous problem, there exists a unique solution. Eigenfunctions of this eigenvalue
                                .
problem are the functions sin      To find the solution, we first find the Fourier sine
                                

series for  (). We write () also as a sine series, but with unknown coefficients. We

substitute the series for () into the equation and solve for the unknown coefficients. If we

have the Neumann boundary conditions (0) = 0, () = 0, we do the same procedure using

the cosine series. Let us see how this method works on examples.

Example 4.4.3: Take the boundary value problem

                      () + 2() =  (), 0 <  < 1,

where  () =  on 0 <  < 1, and satisfying the Dirichlet boundary conditions (0) = 0,
(1) = 0. We write  () as a sine series

                                            

                                () =  sin().

                                          =1

Compute                1  = 2  sin()  = 2 (-1)+1 .
We write () as                                       
We plug in to obtain           0

                                            

                               () =  sin().

                                           =1

                                                         

            () + 2() = - 22 sin() + 2  sin()

                               =1                        =1

                                                             

                               

                      = (2 - 22) sin()

                          =1

                       =  () = 2 (-1)+1 sin().
                                 =1 

Therefore,                     (2 - 22) = 2 (-1)+1
or                                                     

                                  =  2 (-1)+1 .

                                                 22
                                     (2 -   )

That 2 - 22 is not zero for any , and that we can solve for , is precisely because 2 is
not an eigenvalue of the problem. We have thus obtained a Fourier series for the solution

                                        2 (-1)+1
                                                 2 2 sin().
                         () =
                                =1  (2 -   )

See Figure 4.13 for a graph of the solution. Notice that because the eigenfunctions satisfy
the boundary conditions, and  is written in terms of the boundary conditions, then 

satisfies the boundary conditions.

Example 4.4.4: We handle the Neumann conditions with cosine series. Take the boundary

value problem

                         () + 2() =  (), 0 <  < 1,

where again  () =  on 0 <  < 1, but now satisfying the Neumann boundary conditions
(0) = 0, (1) = 0. We write  () as a cosine series

                                         2 =1

where                                  1

                                         0
                                () = +  cos().

                                      odd

Therefore, 0 = 12 ,  = 0 for  even (  2), and for  odd, we have

                                             (2 - 22) = 22 -4 ,
or

                                              = 22(2 - 22 -4 ) .

                      () = +           22(2 - 22) cos().
                              4  =1

4.5.1 Periodically forced oscillation

We return to the forced oscillations. Consider a mass-spring                ()

system as before, where we have a mass  on a spring with                  

spring constant , with damping , and a force () applied                     

to the mass. Suppose the forcing function () is 2-periodic      damping 
for some  > 0. We saw this problem in chapter 2 with

() = 0 cos(). The equation that governs this particular setup is

                          () + () + () = ().                                (4.9)

    The general solution of (4.9) consists of the complementary solution , which solves
the associated homogeneous equation  +  +  = 0, and a particular solution of (4.9)
we call . For  > 0, the complementary solution  will decay as time goes by. Therefore,
we are mostly interested in a particular solution  that does not decay and is periodic with
the same period as (). We call this particular solution the steady periodic solution and we
write it as  as before. What is new in this section is that we consider an arbitrary forcing
function () instead of a simple cosine.

    For simplicity, suppose  = 0. The problem with  > 0 is very similar. The equation

                                  +  = 0

has the general solution

                          () =  cos(0) +  sin(0),

where 0 =  . Any solution to () + () = () is of the form  cos(0) +
 sin(0) + . The steady periodic solution  has the same period as ().

    In the spirit of the last section and the idea of undetermined coefficients we first write

                          0                                   

     () = +                  =1   cos   +  sin   .
              2

Then we write a proposed steady periodic solution  as

                          0                                   

     () = +                  =1   cos   +  sin   ,
              2

where  and  are unknowns. We plug  into the differential equation and solve for 
and  in terms of  and . This process is perhaps best understood by example.
4.5. APPLICATIONS OF FOURIER SERIES                                  227

Example 4.5.1: Suppose that  = 2 and  = 1. The units are again the mks units (meters-

kilograms-seconds). There is a jetpack strapped to the mass, which fires with a force of 1

newton for 1 second and then is off for 1 second, and so on. We want to find the steady

periodic solution.

The equation is, therefore,

                                     + 2 = (),

where () is the step function

                               () = 0 if -1 <  < 0,
                                         1 if 0 <  < 1,

extended periodically. We write

                                                

                                   0
                          () = +  cos() +  sin().

                                   2 =1

We compute

                    1                      1

             = () cos()  = cos()  = 0                      for   1,

                    -1                     0
                    1            1

            0 = ()  =  = 1,

                    -1           0
                    1

             = () sin() 

                      -1

                    1

            = sin() 

                    0

                - cos() 1
            =  =0

            = 1 - (-1) = 2          if  odd,
                                 0  if  even.

So 
                               () = 1 +          2 sin().
                                        2  =1

                                            odd

We want to try                                  

                                   0
                          () = +  cos() +  sin().

                                   2 =1

Once we plug  into the differential equation  + 2 = (), it is clear that  = 0 for   1
as there are no corresponding terms in the series for (). Similarly,  = 0 for even .
228                                        CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

Hence we try                                    

                                  0
                         () = +  sin().

                                  2 =1

                                               odd

We plug into the differential equation and obtain

                                                     

               + 2  =    - 22 sin() + 0 + 2                 sin()

                        =1                            =1
                        odd                           odd

                                 

                    = 0 + (2 - 22) sin()

                          =1
                          odd

                    = () = 1 +           2 sin().
                                2
                                   =1
                                    odd

So 0 = 12 ,  = 0 for even , and for odd , we get

                                    = (2 - 22 2 ) .

The steady periodic solution has the Fourier series

                       () = 1 +            (2 - 22 2 ) sin().
                                  4
                                     =1
                                      odd

We know this is the steady periodic solution as it contains no terms of the complementary
solution and it is periodic with the same period as () itself. See Figure 4.14 on the facing

page for the plot of this solution.

4.5.2 Resonance

Just as when the forcing function was a simple cosine, we may encounter resonance. We
assume  = 0 and so we discuss only pure resonance. Let () be 2-periodic and consider

                                             () + () = ().

When we expand () and find that some of its terms coincide with the complementary
solution to  +  = 0, we cannot use those terms in the guess. Just like before, they
disappear when we plug them into the left-hand side, and we get a contradictory equation
(such as 0 = 1). That is, suppose

                                         =  cos(0) +  sin(0),

where  0   =     for  some  positive  integer  .  We   have    to   modify        our  guess   and  try
               

() = 02 +   cos    +  sin                                         
                                                            +  cos   +  sin   .

In other words, we multiply the offending term by . From then on, we proceed as before.

The solution is not a Fourier series (it is not even periodic) since it contains these terms
                                                               
multiplied by . The terms         cos            +  sin                eventually dominate and lead
                                                                

to wild oscillations. As before, this behavior is called pure resonance or just resonance.

Note that we may hit the resonance frequency with infinitely many terms (overtones) of

the forcing function . That is, suppose we use the same "shape" for , and we change the

base frequency (we change the ). Then different terms from the Fourier series of  may
                                                            
interfere  with  the  complementary   solution,  that  is,     =    0  for  some       ,  and  possibly  cause

resonance. Theoretically, infinitely many base frequencies could cause resonance, however,

we should note that since everything is an approximation to any real life application, only
the first few terms of , and hence only a few such frequencies, would matter in real life.

Example 4.5.2: We want to solve the equation

                                      2 + 182 = (),                                                      (4.10)

where

                                 () = -1 if -1 <  < 0,
                                           1 if 0 <  < 1,

extended periodically. We note that

                                               

                                 () = 4 sin().

Exercise 4.5.1: Compute the Fourier series of  to verify the equation above.

As        =     182   =  3,  the  solution  to  (4.10)  is
                  2

                             () = 1 cos(3) + 2 sin(3) + ()

for some particular solution .
    If we just try an  given as a Fourier series with sin() as usual, the complementary

equation, 2 + 182 = 0, eats our 3rd harmonic. That is, the term with sin(3) is already
in our complementary solution. Therefore, we pull that term out and multiply it by . We

also add a cosine term to get everything right. That is, we try

                                                                                      

                   () = 3 cos(3) + 3 sin(3) +  sin().

                                                                                     =1

We compute the second derivative.

We now plug into the left-hand side of the differential equation.

    When  > 0, you do not have to worry about pure resonance. There are never any
conflicts, and you do not need to multiply any terms by . There is a corresponding concept

of practical resonance, and it is very similar to the ideas we already explored in chapter 2.

Basically, what happens in practical resonance is that one of the coefficients in the series
for  can get very big. Let us not go into details here.

4.6 PDEs, separation of variables, and the heat equation

Note: 2 lectures, §9.5 in [EP], §10.5 in [BD]

    Recall that a partial differential equation or PDE is an equation containing the partial
derivatives with respect to several independent variables. Solving PDEs will be our main
application of Fourier series.

    A PDE is said to be linear if the dependent variable and its derivatives appear at most to
the first power and in no functions. We will only talk about linear PDEs. Together with a
PDE, we usually specify some boundary conditions, where the value of the solution or its
derivatives is given along the boundary of a region, and/or some initial conditions where
the value of the solution or its derivatives is given for some initial time. Sometimes such
conditions are mixed together and we will refer to them simply as side conditions.

    We will study three specific partial differential equations, each one representing a
general class of equations. First, we will study the heat equation, which is an example of a
parabolic PDE. Next, we will study the wave equation, which is an example of a hyperbolic
PDE. Finally, we will study the Laplace equation, which is an example of an elliptic PDE.
Each of our examples will illustrate behavior that is typical for the whole class.

4.6.1 Heat on an insulated wire

We start with the heat equation. Consider a wire (or a thin metal rod) of length  insulated
along its length except at the endpoints. Let  denote the position along the wire and let 
denote time. See Figure 4.15.

     temperature

                            insulation

     Figure 4.15: Insulated wire.

    Let (, ) denote the temperature at point  at time . The equation governing this
setup is the so-called one-dimensional heat equation:

                                                     =  2 2 ,

where  > 0 is a constant (the thermal conductivity of the material). That is, the change in
heat with respect to time at some point is proportional to the second derivative of the heat
4.6. PDES, SEPARATION OF VARIABLES, AND THE HEAT EQUATION                                         233

in the  direction--along the wire. This makes sense; if at a fixed  the graph of the heat
distribution has a maximum (the graph is concave down and the second  derivative is
negative), then heat should flow away from the maximum and so the  derivative should

also be negative. Similarly at a minimum, heat wants to flow in.

    We generally use a more convenient notation for partial derivatives. We write  instead

of      and  we  write    instead  of  2 2 .  With  this  notation  the  heat  equation  becomes

     ,

                                               = .

    The region in which we will solve the heat equation is given by

                                   0 <  <  and  > 0.

We must also have some side conditions on the boundaries                       

of that region. We assume that the ends of the wire are

either exposed and touching some body of constant heat,              =0           =        =0
or the ends are insulated. If the ends of the wire are kept              or        =  ()   or
at temperature 0, then the conditions are                                                   = 0
                                                                     = 0
          (0, ) = 0 and (, ) = 0 for  > 0.                                                

If, on the other hand, the ends are insulated, the conditions 0

are
                               (0, ) = 0 and (, ) = 0 for  > 0.

Let us see why that is so. If  is positive at some point 0, then at a particular time,  is
smaller to the left of 0 and higher to the right of 0. Heat is flowing from high heat to
low heat, that is, to the left. On the other hand, if  is negative, then heat is again flowing

from high heat to low heat, that is, to the right. So when  is zero, we are at a point where

heat is not flowing in either direction. In other words, (0, ) = 0 means no heat is flowing

in or out of the wire at the point  = 0.

    We have two conditions along the -axis as there are two derivatives in the  direction.

These side conditions are said to be homogeneous (i.e.  or a derivative of  is set to zero).

    We also need an initial condition--the temperature distribution at time  = 0. That is,

                                       (, 0) =  () for 0 <  < ,
for some known function  (). This initial condition is not a homogeneous side condition.

4.6.2 Separation of variables

The heat equation is linear as  and its derivatives do not appear to any powers or in any
functions, and it is homogeneous--there is no term independent of . Thus the principle
of superposition still applies for the heat equation (without side conditions): If 1 and 2
are solutions and 1, 2 are constants, then  = 11 + 22 is also a solution.
234                CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

Exercise 4.6.1: Verify the principle of superposition for the heat equation.

    Superposition preserves some side conditions. If 1 and 2 are solutions that satisfy
(0, ) = 0 and (, ) = 0, and 1, 2 are constants, then  = 11 + 22 is still a solution
that satisfies (0, ) = 0 and (, ) = 0. Similarly for the side conditions (0, ) = 0 and
(, ) = 0. In general, superposition preserves all homogeneous side conditions.

    The method of separation of variables is to try to find solutions that are products of
functions of one variable. For the heat equation, we try to find solutions of the form

                                               (, ) = ()().

That the desired particular solution we are looking for is of this form is too much to hope for.
What is perfectly reasonable to ask, however, is to find enough "building-block" solutions
of the form (, ) = ()() using this procedure so that the desired solution to the PDE
is somehow constructed from these building blocks by the use of superposition.

    Let us try to solve the heat equation problem

            =  , with (0, ) = 0, (, ) = 0, and (, 0) =  ().

We guess (, ) = ()(). We will try to make this guess satisfy the differential equation,
 = , and the homogeneous side conditions, (0, ) = 0 and (, ) = 0. Then, as
superposition preserves the differential equation and the homogeneous side conditions,
we will try to build up a solution from these building blocks to solve the nonhomogeneous
initial condition (, 0) =  ().

    First, we plug (, ) = ()() into the heat equation to obtain

                                           ()() = ()().

We rewrite as  () ()
               () = () .

This equation must hold for all  and all . But the left-hand side does not depend on 
and the right-hand side does not depend on . Hence, each side must be a constant. Let us

call this constant - (the minus sign is for convenience later). We obtain the two equations

               ()   ( )
               () = - = () .

In other words,

                                              () + () = 0,
                                               () + () = 0.

The boundary condition (0, ) = 0 implies (0)() = 0. We are looking for a nontrivial
solution, and so we can assume that () is not identically zero. Hence (0) = 0. Similarly,
(, ) = 0 implies () = 0. We are looking for nontrivial solutions  of the eigenvalue
4.6. PDES, SEPARATION OF VARIABLES, AND THE HEAT EQUATION                      235

problem  +  = 0, (0) = 0, () = 0. We have previously found that the only

               22                                                      
eigenvalues are  = 2 , for integers   1, where eigenfunctions are sin   . Hence,

let us pick the solutions      () = sin   .

The corresponding  must satisfy the equation

                                  22
                               () + 2 () = 0.

                                          

This is one of our fundamental equations, and the solution is an exponential:

                                                   -22 

                                   () =  2 ,

where we picked the particular solution where conveniently (0) = 1. Our building-block

solutions are                                              -22 

               (, ) = ()() = sin   2 .
                                                         

We note that (, 0) = sin        .  We write   () as the sine series

                              

                                          
                                () =  sin   .

                                           =1

That is, we find the Fourier series of the odd periodic extension of  (). We used the
sine series as it corresponds to the eigenvalue problem for () above. Finally, we use

superposition to write the solution as

                                                                 -22
                                                            
               (, ) = (, ) =  sin                                  2 

                                                               .

                           =1      =1

    Why does this solution work? First note that it is a solution to the heat equation by
superposition. It satisfies (0, ) = 0 and (, ) = 0, because  = 0 or  =  makes all the
sines vanish. Finally, plugging in  = 0, we notice that (0) = 1, and so

                                                            
                                                            
               (, 0) = (, 0) =  sin                           =  ().

                           =1      =1

Example 4.6.1: Consider an insulated wire of length 1 whose ends are embedded in ice
(temperature 0). Let  = 0.003 and let the initial heat distribution be (, 0) = 50  (1 - ).

See Figure 4.16 on the following page. Suppose we want to find the temperature function
(, ). In particular, suppose we want to find when (at what time ) does the maximum

temperature in the wire drop to one half of the initial maximum of 12.5.

              Figure 4.16: Initial distribution of temperature in the wire.

We are solving the following PDE problem:

               = 0.003                         for 0 <  < 1 and  > 0,
              (0, ) = (1, ) = 0                for  > 0,
              (, 0) = 50  (1 - )               for 0 <  < 1.

Write  () = 50  (1 - ) for 0 <  < 1 as a sine series  () =              sin(),  where
                                                             =1

      = 2   1 200 200 (-1) 0                                                 if  even,
              50  (1 - ) sin()  =                   -        3 3 = 400       if  odd.
                                                       
                                               33
           0                                                        3  3

We plug in these coefficients into the series for (, ) to obtain the solution

                                         400 33 sin() -22 0.003  .

                        (, ) =

                                   =1
                                    odd

We plot the solution in Figure 4.17 on the next page for 0    100.

    Finally, we answer the question about the maximum temperature. It is relatively easy
to see that the maximum temperature at any fixed time is always at  = 0.5, in the middle
of the wire. The plot of (, ) confirms this intuition. If we plug in  = 0.5, we get

                                         400 33 sin( 0.5) -22 0.003  .

                        (0.5, ) =

                                   =1
                                    odd

For  = 3 and higher (remember  is only odd), the terms of the series are insignificant

compared to the first term. The first term in the series is already a very good approximation

of the function. Hence        (0.5, )  3 400 -2 0.003  .

Figure 4.17: Plot of the temperature (, ) of the wire at position  at time  for 0    100. Notice the
side conditions (0, ) = (1, ) = 0 and how the exponential makes the temperature decay with time.

The approximation gets better and better as  gets larger as the other terms decay much
faster. We plot the function (0.5, ), the temperature at the midpoint of the wire at time ,

and its approximation by the first term in Figure 4.18 on the following page.
    After  = 5 or so, it would be hard to tell the difference between the first term of the

series for (, ) and the real solution (, ). This behavior is a general feature of solving
the heat equation. If you are interested in behavior for large enough , only the first one or

two terms may be necessary.

    We get back to the question of when is the maximum temperature one half of the initial
maximum temperature. That is, when is the temperature at the midpoint 12.5/2 = 6.25. The

graph suggests that the approximation by the first term will be close enough. We solve

                                                6.25 = 400 -2 0.003  .
                                                          3

That is,                                              ln 400 6.25 3
                                                 = -20.003  24.5.

So the maximum temperature drops to half at about  = 24.5.

Figure 4.18: Temperature at the midpoint of the wire (the bottom curve), and the approximation of this
temperature by using only the first term in the series (top curve).

We mention an interesting behavior of the solution to the heat equation. The heat

equation "smoothes" out the function  () as  grows. For a fixed , the solution is a Fourier

                                                  -22 

series with coefficients   2 . If  > 0, then these coefficients go to zero faster than

any  1  for  any  power  .  In       other  words,  the  Fourier  series  has  infinitely  many  derivatives
     

everywhere. Thus even if the function  () has jumps and corners, then for a fixed  > 0,

the solution (, ) as a function of  is as smooth as we want it to be.

Example 4.6.2: When the initial condition is already a sine series, then there is no need to
compute anything, you just need to plug in. Consider

         = 0.3  , (0, ) = (1, ) = 0, (, 0) = 0.1 sin() + sin(2).

The solution is then
                             (, ) = 0.1 sin()-0.32 + sin(2)-1.22 .

4.6.3 Insulated ends

Now suppose the ends of the wire are insulated. In this case, we are solving the problem

             =  with (0, ) = 0, (, ) = 0, and (, 0) =  ().

Yet again we try a solution of the form (, ) = ()(). By the same procedure as before,
we plug into the heat equation and arrive at the following two equations:

                                              () + () = 0,
                                               () + () = 0.
4.6. PDES, SEPARATION OF VARIABLES, AND THE HEAT EQUATION                                   239

At this point, the story changes slightly. The boundary condition (0, ) = 0 implies

(0)() = 0. Hence (0) = 0. Similarly, (, ) = 0 implies () = 0. We want

nontrivial solutions  of the eigenvalue problem  +  = 0, (0) = 0, () = 0.

                                                                         22
We previously found that the only eigenvalues are  = 2 , for integers   0, where
                         
eigenfunctions are cos     (we include the constant eigenfunction). We pick the solutions
                         

                        () = cos                    and 0() = 1.

The corresponding  must satisfy the equation

                                       22
                                    () + 2 () = 0.

                                               

For   1, as before,                                    -22 

                                       () =  2 .

For  = 0, we have 0() = 0 and hence 0() = 1. Our building-block solutions are

                                                                         -22 
                        (, ) = ()() = cos   2
                                                                   

and
                                                   0(, ) = 1.

We note that (, 0) = cos               .  We write                 using the cosine series

                                     

                                          0                        

                            () = +           =1   cos   .
                                    2

That is, we find the Fourier series of the even periodic extension of  ().
    We use superposition to write the solution as

                                                                                    -22
                                                                          
                        0                        0                                    2 
(, ) = + (, ) = +  cos
                        2 =1                     2 =1                             .

Example 4.6.3: Try the same equation as before, but with insulated ends. We are solving
the following PDE problem

 = 0.003                                         for 0 <  < 1 and  > 0,
(0, ) = (1, ) = 0                                for  > 0,
(, 0) = 50  (1 - )                               for 0 <  < 1.

For this problem, we must find the cosine series of (, 0). For 0 <  < 1, we have

                                                                   -200  cos().

           Figure 4.19: Plot of the temperature of the insulated wire at position  at time .

     Note in the graph that as time goes on, the temperature evens out across the wire.

Eventually, all the terms except the constant die out, and you will be left with a uniform

temperature    of    25      8.33           along     the   entire   length  of  the     wire.

     Let us expand on the last point. The constant term in the series is
                                                            0 = 1    () .

                     0
In  other  words,    2   is  the         average      value  of      (),  that  is,  the    average  of                                          the  initial  temperature.

As the wire is insulated everywhere, no heat can get out, no heat can get in. So the

temperature tries to distribute evenly over time, and the average temperature must always
be the same, in particular, it is always 20 . As time goes to infinity, the temperature goes to
               0
the  constant  2   everywhere.

4.7 One-dimensional wave equation

Note: 1 lecture, §9.6 in [EP], §10.7 in [BD]
    Imagine a tensioned guitar string of length  that can vibrate. We will only consider

vibrations in one direction. Let  denote the position along the string, let  denote time,
and let (, ) denote the displacement of the string from the rest position. See Figure 4.20.



   

0                                   

Figure 4.20: Vibrating string of length ,  is position,  is displacement.

    The equation that governs this setup is the so-called one-dimensional wave equation:

                                                    = 2 ,

for some constant  > 0. The intuition is similar to the heat equation, replacing velocity
with acceleration: the acceleration at a specific point is proportional to the second derivative
of the shape of the string. In other words, when the string is concave down then  is
negative and the string wants to accelerate downwards, so  should be negative. And
vice versa. The wave equation is an example of a hyperbolic PDE.

    We will again solve for  in the region 0 <  <  and  > 0. Assume that the ends of
the string are fixed in place as on the guitar:

                                (0, ) = 0 and (, ) = 0 for  > 0.

We have two conditions along the -axis as there are two derivatives in the  direction.
There are also two derivatives along the  direction and hence we need two further
conditions here. We need to know the initial position and the initial velocity of the string.
That is, for some known functions  () and (), we impose

                        (, 0) =  () and (, 0) = () for 0 <  < .

    The equation is linear and homogeneous, so superposition works just as it did for the
heat equation. Superposition also preserves the homogeneous side conditions (0, ) = 0
and (, ) = 0. Again we will use separation of variables to find enough building-block
solutions to get the particular solution also solving the nonhomogeneous initial conditions.
There is one change however. We will solve two separate problems and add their solutions.
244                                  CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

The two problems we will solve are

                    = 2              for 0 <  <  and  > 0,   (4.11)
                                     for  > 0,
                   (0, ) = (, ) = 0  for 0 <  < ,
                   (, 0) = 0         for 0 <  < ,
                   (, 0) = ()

and                 = 2              for 0 <  <  and  > 0,

                   (0, ) = (, ) = 0  for  > 0,               (4.12)
                   (, 0) =  ()       for 0 <  < ,

                   (, 0) = 0         for 0 <  < .

    The principle of superposition implies that  =  +  solves the wave equation and
the homogeneous side conditions. Furthermore, (, 0) = (, 0) + (, 0) =  () and
(, 0) = (, 0) + (, 0) = (). Hence,  is a solution to

                    = 2              for 0 <  <  and  > 0,   (4.13)
                                     for  > 0,
                   (0, ) = (, ) = 0  for 0 <  < ,
                   (, 0) =  ()       for 0 <  < .
                   (, 0) = ()

    The reason for all this complexity is that superposition only works for homogeneous
conditions such as (0, ) = (, ) = 0, (, 0) = 0, or (, 0) = 0. Therefore, we can use
separation of variables to find many building-block solutions solving all the homogeneous
conditions. We can then use them to construct a solution satisfying the remaining
nonhomogeneous condition.

    Let us start with (4.11). We try a solution of the form (, ) = ()() again. We plug
into the wave equation to obtain

                                          ()() = 2()().

Rewriting, we get             () ()
                              2() = () .

Again, left-hand side depends only on  and the right-hand side depends only on . So
both sides equal a constant, which we denote by -:

                               ( )    ( )
                              2() = - = () .

We solve to get two ordinary differential equations

                                               () + () = 0,
                                              () + 2() = 0.
4.7. ONE-DIMENSIONAL WAVE EQUATION                                                                                        245

The condition 0 = (0, ) = (0)() implies (0) = 0 and (, ) = 0 implies that () = 0.

                                                                                                                                                  22

Therefore, the only nontrivial solutions for the first equation are when  =  = 2 and

they are                                  () = sin   .

The general solution for  for this particular  is

                              () =  cos    +  sin    .

We also have the condition that (, 0) = 0 or ()(0) = 0. This implies that (0) = 0,
                                                                      
which  in  turn  forces    =  0.  It  is  convenient  to  pick    =     (you  will                       see  why  in  a  moment)

and hence                                 () =   sin    .

Our building-block solutions are

                              (, ) =   sin   sin    .

We differentiate in :               (, ) = sin   cos    .

Hence,                                      (, 0) = sin   .

We expand () in terms of these sines as

                                                     
                                          () =  sin   .

                                                      =1

Using superposition we write the solution to (4.11) as a series

                                  
                 (, ) = (, ) =   sin   sin   .
                              =1          =1

Exercise 4.7.1: Check that (, 0) = 0 and (, 0) = ().

    We solve (4.12) similarly. We again try (, ) = ()(). The procedure works exactly
the same at first. We obtain

                                          () + () = 0,
                                          () + 2() = 0,

                                                                                                     22

and the conditions (0) = 0, () = 0. Again,  =  = 2 and
                                              () = sin   .
246                                 CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

This time, the condition on  is (0) = 0. Thus we get that  = 0, and we take
                                              () = cos    .

Our building-block solution is
                                     (, ) = sin   cos    .

As (, 0) = sin     , we expand    () in terms of these sines as

                 

                                            
                                  () =  sin   .

                                             =1

We write down the solution to (4.12) as a series

                           
                (, ) =  (, ) =  sin   cos   .
                        =1          =1

Exercise 4.7.2: Fill in the details in the derivation of the solution of (4.12). Check that the solution
satisfies all the side conditions.

Putting these two solutions together, let us state the result as a theorem.

Theorem 4.7.1. Take the problem

                 = 2                    for 0 <  <  and  > 0,                          (4.14)
                                        for  > 0,
                (0, ) = (, ) = 0        for 0 <  < ,
                (, 0) =  ()             for 0 <  < ,
                (, 0) = ()

where                                                     
        () =  sin                   and () =  sin   .

                   =1                                          =1

Then the solution (, ) can be written as a sum of the solutions of (4.11) and (4.12):

                                   sin    +  sin   cos   
       (, ) =   sin                 sin    +  cos    .

                       =1

                         
                         
                = sin

                    =1

Example 4.7.1: Consider a string of length 2 plucked in the middle, it has an initial shape
given in Figure 4.21 on the next page. That is,

                         () = 0.1                 if 0    1,

                                 0.1 (2 - ) if 1 <   2.

                   Figure 4.21: Initial shape of a plucked string from Example 4.7.1.

    Let the string start at rest (() = 0), and let  = 1 for simplicity. In other words, we
wish to solve the problem:

                    =                   for 0 <  < 2 and  > 0,
                                        for  > 0,
                   (0, ) = (2, ) = 0    for 0 <  < 2,
                   (, 0) =  ()          for 0 <  < 2.
                   (, 0) = 0

We leave the details of computing the sine series of  () to the reader. The series is

                                   0.8  
                         () = 22 sin 2 sin 2  .

                                    =1

Note that sin      is the sequence 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, . . . for  = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .. Therefore,
                2

                () = 2 0.8 sin 2  - 92 0.8 sin 32  + 252 0.8 sin 52  - · · ·

The solution (, ) is given by

             0.8   
(, ) = 22 sin 2 sin 2  cos 2 

                =1

=   0.8(-1)+1                  (2 - 1)   cos  (2 - 1)  
                        2 sin
   =1 (2 - 1) 2                2              2

= 2 0.8 sin 2  cos 2  - 92 0.8 sin 32  cos 32 

                                              + 252 0.8 sin 52  cos 52  - · · ·

    See Figure 4.22 on the following page for a plot for 0 <  < 3. Notice that unlike the
heat equation, the solution does not become "smoother," the "sharp edges" remain. We
will see the reason for this behavior in the next section where we derive the solution to the
wave equation in a different way.

    Make sure you understand what the plot, such as the one in the figure, is telling you.

One thing to take away from all this is how a guitar sounds. Notice that the (angular)

            ,

called the overtones. Which overtones appear and with what amplitude is what musicians

call the timbre of the note. Mathematicians usually call this the spectrum. Because all the

frequencies are multiples of one frequency (the fundamental), we get a nice pleasing sound.
                                      
The  fundamental      frequency            increases                 as  we  decrease          length                                                           .       That  is,  if  we  place  a

finger on the fingerboard and then pluck a string we get a higher note. The constant  is

the tuning peg on a guitar) increases  and hence produces a higher fundamental frequency
(a higher note). On the other hand, using a heavier string reduces  and produces a lower
fundamental frequency (a lower note). A bass guitar has longer thicker strings, while a
ukulele has short strings made of lighter material.

    Something rather interesting is the almost-symmetry between space and time. In its
simplest form, we see this symmetry in the solutions

                                            sin   sin    .

Except for the constant , this solution looks the same if we flip time and space. In general,
the solution for a fixed  is a Fourier series in , for a fixed  it is a Fourier series in , and
the coefficients are related. If the shape  () or the initial velocity () have lots of corners,
then the sound wave will have lots of corners. That is because the Fourier coefficients of
the initial shape decay to zero (as   ) at the same rate as the Fourier coefficients of
the wave in time (for some fixed ). So if you use a sharp object to pick the string, you get
a sharper sound with lots of high-frequency components, while if you use your thumb,
you get a softer sound without so many high overtones. Similarly, if you pluck close to

the bridge (close to one end of the string), you are getting a pluck that looks more like the

sawtooth, and you get an even sharper sound.
    In fact, if you look at the formula for the solution, you see that for any fixed , we get an

almost arbitrary Fourier series in , everything except the constant term. In theory, you can

obtain any timbre you want by plucking the string in just the right way. Of course, we are

considering an ideal string of no stiffness and no air resistance. Those variables clearly

impact the sound as well.

4.8 D'Alembert solution of the wave equation

Note: 1 lecture, different from §9.6 in [EP], part of §10.7 in [BD]

    We have solved the wave equation by using Fourier series. But it is often more convenient
to use the so-called d'Alembert solution to the wave equation. While this solution can be
derived using Fourier series as well, it is really an awkward use of those concepts. It is
easier and more instructive to derive this solution by making a correct change of variables
to get an equation that can be solved by simple integration.

    Suppose we wish to solve the wave equation

                            = 2                                                       (4.15)

in the region 0 <  <  and  > 0 subject to the side conditions

                 (0, ) = (, ) = 0        for  > 0,                                    (4.16)
                 (, 0) =  ()             for 0 <  < ,
                 (, 0) = ()              for 0 <  < .

4.8.1 Change of variables

We will transform the equation into a simpler form where it can be solved by simple
integration. We change variables to  =  - ,  =  + . The chain rule says:

                  =   +   =  +  ,
                       

                  =   +   = -  +   .
                                          

We compute

             2   +          +        2       2 2                         ,
      = 2 =                       = 2    +2                          +
                                 +                                      2
             
            2    -  +      -             = 2  - 2 2 2 2                     + 2  . 2
      = 2 =                                                                       2
                                                     2
                                                                        

In the computations above, we used the fact from calculus that  2 =  2 . We plug what
we got into the wave equation,

                                   0 = 2  -  = 42  = 4 2  2 .
                                                               

Therefore, the wave equation (4.15) transforms into  = 0. It is easy to find the general
solution to this new equation by integrating twice. Keeping  constant, we integrate with

Named after the French mathematician Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1717-1783).
4.8. D'ALEMBERT SOLUTION OF THE WAVE EQUATION                                      253

respect to  first and note that the constant of integration depends on ; for each , we may
get a different constant of integration. We get  = (). Next, we integrate with respect to
 and note that the constant of integration depends on . Thus,  = ()  + (). The
solution must, therefore, be of the following form for some functions () and ():

                                  = () + () = ( - ) + ( + ).

The solution is a superposition of two functions (waves) traveling at speed  in opposite
directions. The coordinates  and  are called the characteristic coordinates, and a similar
technique can be applied to more complicated hyperbolic PDEs. In § 1.9 it is used to solve
first-order linear PDEs. Basically, to solve the wave equation (or more general hyperbolic
equations) we find certain characteristic curves along which the equation is really just an
ODE, or a pair of ODEs. In this case these are the curves where  and  are constant.

4.8.2 D'Alembert's formula

We know what any solution must look like, but we need to solve for the given side

conditions. We will just give the formula and see that it works. Let () denote the odd

periodic extension of  (), and let () denote the odd periodic extension of (). Define

                                                               
() = 1 () - 1 () ,                  () = 1() + 1 () .
2        2 0                              2      2 0

We claim these () and () give the solution. Explicitly, the solution is (, ) =
( - ) + ( + ) or in other words:

(, ) = 1( - ) - 1   -          ()  + 1( + ) + 1                 +

2 2 0  +2 2 0                                                                 () 

= ( - ) + ( + ) + 1                                                                (4.17)

      2                        2 -  () .

Let us check that the d'Alembert formula really works. First,

   (, 0) = () + () + 1   ()  = ().
                            2     2 

So far so good. Assume for simplicity  is differentiable. And we use the first form of (4.17)
as it is easier to differentiate. By the fundamental theorem of calculus we have

(, ) = - ( - ) + 1 ( - ) +  ( + ) + 1 ( + ).
   2                           2       2                       2

So  - (, 0) = () + 1 () +  () + 1 () = ().
         2                     2    2        2

There is nothing special about , you can integrate with  first, if you wish.
254                                                 CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

Yay! We're smoking now. OK, now the boundary conditions. Note that () and () are

odd. So
(0, ) = (-) + () + 1   ()  = -() + () + 1   ()  = 0 + 0 = 0.
               2              2 -                         2             2 -

Now () is odd and 2-periodic, so

       ( - ) + ( + ) = (- - ) + ( + ) = -( + ) + ( + ) = 0.

Next, () is odd and 2-periodic, so we change variables  =  - . We then notice that

( + ) = ( - ) = -(- + ), so ( + ) is odd as a function of :

                               +                  

                              -      ()  = ( + )  = 0.
                                                 -

Hence          (, ) = ( - ) + ( + ) + 1  + ()  = 0 + 0 = 0.

                                     2              2 -

And voilà, it works.

Example 4.8.1: D'Alembert says that the solution is a superposition of two functions
(waves) moving in the opposite direction at "speed" . To get an idea of how it works, we

work out the following example. Consider the simpler setup

                        =                           for 0 <  < 1 and  > 0,
                                                    for  > 0,
                       (0, ) = (1, ) = 0            for 0 <  < 1,
                       (, 0) =  ()                  for 0 <  < 1.
                       (, 0) = 0

Let  () be the following triangular impulse of height 1 centered at  = 0.5:

                                      0             if 0   < 0.45,
                                                    if 0.45   < 0.5,
                                      20 ( - 0.45)  if 0.5   < 0.55,
                               () =                 if 0.55    1.
                                      20 (0.55 - )
                                      0

The graph of this impulse is the top left plot in Figure 4.24 on the facing page.
    Let () be the odd periodic extension of  (). Then (4.17) says that the solution is

                              (, ) =      ( - ) + ( + )             .

                                                    2

It is not hard to compute specific values of (, ). For example, to compute (0.1, 0.6),

we notice  -  = -0.5 and  +  = 0.7. Now (-0.5) = -  (0.5) = -20 (0.55 - 0.5) = -1

and  (0.7)  =   (0.7)  =  0.  Hence  (0.1, 0.6)  =  -1+0  =  -0.5.  As  you  can  see  the  d'Alembert
                                                      2

solution is much easier to actually compute and to plot than the Fourier series solution.

See Figure 4.24 on the next page for plots of the solution  for several different .

4.8.3 Another way to solve for the side conditions

It is perhaps easier and more useful to remember the procedure rather than memorizing the
formula itself. The important thing is that a solution to the wave equation is a superposition
of two waves traveling in opposite directions. That is,

                          (, ) = ( - ) + ( + ).

If you think about it, the exact formulas for  and  are not hard to guess once you realize

what kind of side conditions (, ) is supposed to satisfy. Let us walk through the formula

again, but slightly differently. Best approach is to do it in stages. When () = 0 (and hence

() = 0), the solution is        ( - ) + ( + )
                                                           .

                                            2

On the other hand, when  () = 0 (and hence () = 0), we let

                                      

                                () = () .

                                      0
256                              CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

The solution in this case is

     1  + ()  = -( - ) + ( + ).
     2 -                         2

By superposition, we get a solution for the general side conditions (4.16) (when neither
 () nor () are identically zero).

                                 ( - ) + ( + ) -( - ) + ( + )                            (4.18)
                     (, ) = 2 + 2 .
Do note the minus sign before the  and the  in the second denominator.

Exercise 4.8.1: Check that the new formula (4.18) satisfies the side conditions (4.16).

    Warning: Make sure you use the odd periodic extensions () and (), when you
have formulas for  () and (). The thing is, those formulas in general hold only for
0 <  <  and are not usually equal to () and () for other .

4.8.4 Some remarks

We remark that the formula (, ) = ( - ) + ( + ) is the reason why the solution

of the wave equation does not get "nicer" as time goes on, that is, why in the examples
where the initial conditions had corners, the solution also has corners at every time .

The corners bring us to another interesting remark. Nobody ever notices at first that

our example solutions are not even differentiable (they have corners): In Example 4.8.1

above, the solution is not differentiable whenever  =  + 0.5 or  = - + 0.5 for example.

Really to be able to compute  or , you need not one, but two derivatives. Fear not, we

could think of a shape that is very nearly () but does have two derivatives by rounding
                                                                      (-)+(+)
the corners a little bit, and then the solution would be very nearly           and nobody
                                                                      2

would notice the switch.

One final remark is what the d'Alembert solution tells us about what part of the initial

conditions influence the solution at a certain point. We can figure this out by "traveling

backwards along the characteristics." Suppose that the string is very long (perhaps infinite)
for simplicity. Since the solution at time  is

     (, ) = ( - ) + ( + ) + 1  + () ,
                              2  2 -

we notice that we have only used the initial conditions in the interval [ - ,  + ]. The

endpoints of this interval are called the wavefronts, as that is where the wave front is given
an initial ( = 0) disturbance at . If  = 1, an observer sitting at  = 0 at time  = 1 has only
seen the initial conditions for  in the range [-1, 1] and is blissfully unaware of anything

else. This is why, for example, we do not know that a supernova has occurred in the

universe until we see its light, millions of years from the time when it did in fact happen.

4.9 Steady state temperature and the Laplacian

Note: 1 lecture, §9.7 in [EP], §10.8 in [BD]

    Consider an insulated wire, a plate, or a 3-dimensional object. We apply certain
fixed temperatures on the ends of the wire, the edges of the plate, or on all sides of the
3-dimensional object. We wish to find out what is the steady-state temperature distribution.
That is, we wish to know what will be the temperature after long enough period of time.

    We are really seeking a solution to the heat equation that is not dependent on time. We
first solve the problem in one space variable. We are looking for a function  that satisfies

                            =  ,

but such that  = 0 for all  and . Hence, we are looking for a function of  alone that

satisfies  = 0. It is easy to solve this equation by integration, and we see that  =  + 

for some constants  and .

    Consider an insulated wire where we apply constant temperature 1 at one end (say
where  = 0) and 2 on the other end (at  =  where  is the length of the wire). Our

steady-state solution is   () = 2 - 1   + 1.

It is simply a straight line from one end to the other. This solution agrees with the common-
sense intuition on how heat should be distributed in the wire. So in one dimension, the
steady-state solutions are just straight lines.

    Things are more complicated in two or more space dimensions. We restrict ourselves to
two space dimensions for simplicity. The heat equation in two space variables is

                            = ( + ),            (4.19)

or more commonly written as  =  or  = 2. The  and 2 symbols both mean

2    2
2 + 2 . We will use  here. The reason for using such a notation is that you can define 

to be the right thing for any number of space dimensions and then the heat equation is
always  = . The operator  is called the Laplacian.

   OK, now that we have notation out of the way, let us see what does an equation for the

steady-state solution look like. We are looking for a solution to (4.19) that does not depend
on , that is,  = 0. Hence, we are looking for a function (, ) such that

                            =  +  = 0.

This equation is called the Laplace equation and is an example of an elliptic equation.
Solutions to the Laplace equation are called harmonic functions and have many nice
properties and applications far beyond the steady-state heat problem.

     Named after the French mathematician Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace (1749-1827).
4.9. STEADY STATE TEMPERATURE AND THE LAPLACIAN           259

    Harmonic functions in two variables are no longer just linear (so not just plane graphs).
For example, you can check that the functions 2 - 2 and   are harmonic. However,
note that if  is positive,  is concave up in the  direction, then  must be negative
and  must be concave down in the  direction. A harmonic function can never have any

"hilltop" or "valley" on the graph. This observation is consistent with our intuitive idea of

steady-state heat distribution; the hottest or coldest spot should not be inside.
    Commonly the Laplace equation is part of a so-called Dirichlet problem. That is, we

have a region in the -plane and we specify certain values along the boundaries of the
region. We then try to find a solution  to the Laplace equation defined on this region such
that  agrees with the values we specified on the boundary.

    In this section, we consider a rectangular region. For simplicity, we specify boundary

values to be zero at 3 of the four edges and only specify an arbitrary function at one edge.

As we still have the principle of superposition, we can use this simpler solution to derive

the general solution for arbitrary boundary values by solving 4 different problems, one for

each edge, and adding those solutions together. This setup is left as an exercise.
    We wish to solve the following problem. Let  and  be the height and width of our

rectangle, with one corner at the origin and lying in the first quadrant, so that the region is
given by 0 <  <  and 0 <  < . Consider the problem

 = 0,        for 0 <  < ,  (4.20)  (0, )    =0     (, )
(0, ) = 0    for 0 <  < ,  (4.21)  =0       = 0     =0
(, ) = 0     for 0 <  < ,  (4.22)  (0, 0)
(, ) = 0     for 0 <  < .  (4.23)
(, 0) =  ()                (4.24)

                                            =  ()  (, 0)

    The method we apply is separation of variables. Again, we will come up with
enough building-block solutions satisfying all the homogeneous boundary conditions (all
conditions except (4.24)). We notice that superposition still works for the equation and all
the homogeneous conditions. Therefore, we can use the Fourier series for  () to find a
solution  that also solves (4.24).

    We try (, ) = ()(). We plug  into the equation to get

                                                 +  = 0.

We put the s on one side and the s on the other to get

                                                       
                                                   - = .

     Named after the German mathematician Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805-1859).
260                       CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

The left-hand side only depends on  and the right-hand side only depends on . Therefore,
there is some constant  such that  =  - =  . And we get two equations

                   +  = 0,
                   -  = 0.

Furthermore, the homogeneous boundary conditions imply that (0) = () = 0 and
() = 0. Using the equation for , we have already seen that there is a nontrivial solution

                                          22

if and only if  =  = 2 and the solution is a multiple of

                                              () = sin    .

For these given , the general solution for  (one for each ) is      (4.25)
                               () =  cosh    +  sinh    .

There is only one condition on  and hence we can pick one of  or  to be something

convenient. It will be useful to have (0) = 1, so let  = 1. Setting () = 0 and solving

for , we get          - cosh 

                                      
                   =             .

                          
                      sinh 

After we plug the  and  into (4.25) and simplify by using the identity sinh( - ) =
sinh() cosh() - cosh() sinh(), we find

                             sinh  (-)
                  () = sinh  .

                                                

We define (, ) = ()(). Note that  satisfies (4.20)-(4.23). Observe
                                    (, 0) = ()(0) = sin    .

Suppose                      
                   () =  sin  .

                              =1

Then we get a solution of (4.20)-(4.24) of the following form.

                (, ) =   (, ) =  sin   sinh  (-) .
                                                  sinh 
              =1      =1                                        

As  satisfies (4.20)-(4.23) and any linear combination (finite or infinite) of  also satisfies
(4.20)-(4.23), then  satisfies (4.20)-(4.23). We plug in  = 0 to see  satisfies (4.24) as well.

Example 4.9.1: Take  =  =  and let  () = . Let us compute the sine series for the
function  (same as the series for the square wave). For 0 <  < , we have

                                                       4 sin().

                               () =

    This scenario corresponds to the steady-state temperature on a square plate of width 
with 3 sides held at 0 degrees and one side held at  degrees. If we have arbitrary initial
data on all sides, then we solve four problems, each using one piece of nonhomogeneous
data. Then we use the principle of superposition to add up all four solutions to have a
solution to the original problem.

    A different way to visualize solutions of the Laplace equation is to take a wire and bend
it so that it corresponds to the graph of the temperature above the boundary of your region.
Cut a rubber sheet in the shape of your region--a square in our case--and stretch it fixing
the edges of the sheet to the wire. The rubber sheet is a good approximation of the graph
of the solution to the Laplace equation with the given boundary data.

4.10 Dirichlet problem in the circle and the Poisson kernel

Note: 2 lectures, §9.7 in [EP], §10.8 in [BD]

4.10.1 Laplace in polar coordinates

A more natural setting for the Laplace equation  = 0 is a circle rather than a rectangle.

On the other hand, what makes the problem somewhat more difficult is that we need polar

coordinates.                                                            (, )
    Recall that the polar coordinates for the (, )-plane are (, ):  

                              =  cos ,  =  sin ,                        

where   0 and - <   . So the point (, ) is distance  from the
origin at an angle  from the positive -axis.

Now that we know our coordinates, let us give the problem we wish to solve. We have

a circular region of radius 1, and we are interested in the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace
equation for this region. Let (, ) denote the temperature at the point (, ) in polar

coordinates.

We have the problem:                                                (1, ) = ()

      = 0                 for  < 1,            (4.26)

     (1, ) = () for - <   .                                          = 0

The first issue we face is that we do not know the

Laplacian in polar coordinates. Normally, we would                  radius 1
find  and  in terms of the derivatives in  and .
We would need to solve for  and  in terms of  and .

In this case, it is more convenient to work in reverse. We
compute derivatives in  and  in terms of derivatives
in  and  and then we solve. The computations are

easier this way. First,

                           = cos ,  = - sin ,
                           = sin ,  =  cos .

By chain rule, we obtain

                =   +   = cos() + sin() ,
               = cos()(  +  ) + sin()(  +  )

                  = cos2() + 2 cos() sin() + sin2().
4.10. DIRICHLET PROBLEM IN THE CIRCLE AND THE POISSON KERNEL                                           265

Similarly for the  derivative. Note that we have to use the product rule for the second
derivative.

  =   +   = - sin() +  cos() ,
 = - cos() -  sin()(  +  ) -  sin() +  cos()(  +  )

     = - cos() -  sin() + 2 sin2() - 22 sin() cos() + 2 cos2().

Let  us  now  try  to  find    +  .  We  start  with  1    to  get  rid  of  those  pesky  2.  If  we  add

                                                      2 

 and use the fact that cos2() + sin2() = 1, we get

                       21  +  =  +  - 1 cos() - 1 sin() .

We are not quite there yet, but all we are lacking is 1 . We add it to obtain the Laplacian in
polar coordinates:

                                    =  +  = 21  + 1  +  .

     Notice that the Laplacian in polar coordinates no longer has constant coefficients.

4.10.2 Series solution

Let us separate variables as usual. That is, we try (, ) = ()(). Then

                                     0 =  = 21  + 1  + .
We put  on one side and  on the other and conclude that both sides must be constant.

                                  21  = - 1  +  

                                      = -  + 2 = -
                                                      

We get two equations:

                                      +  = 0,
                                     2 +  -  = 0.

We first focus on . We know that (, ) ought to be 2-periodic in , that is, (, ) =
(,  + 2). Therefore, the solution to  +  = 0 must be 2-periodic. We have seen
such a problem in Example 4.1.5. We conclude that  = 2 for a nonnegative integer
 = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .. The equation becomes  + 2 = 0. When  = 0 the equation is just
 = 0, so we have the general solution  + . As  is periodic,  = 0. For convenience,

we write this solution as                       0 = 0
                                                        2
266                                         CHAPTER 4. FOURIER SERIES AND PDES

for some constant 0. For positive , the solution to  + 2 = 0 is
                                        =  cos() +  sin(),

for some constants  and .
    Next, we consider the equation for ,

                                            2 +  - 2 = 0.

This equation appeared in exercises before--we solved it in Exercise 2.1.6 and Exercise 2.1.7
on page 83. The idea is to try a solution  and if that does not give us two solutions, also
try a solution of the form  ln . We name the solution  as usual. When  = 0 we obtain

                     0 = 0 + 0 ln  =  +  ln ,

and if  > 0, we get      =  + -.

The function (, ) must be finite (it cannot blow up) at the origin, that is, when  = 0. So
 = 0 in both cases as otherwise - or ln  does blow up as   0. Set  = 1 in both cases;
the constants in  will pick up the slack so nothing is lost. That is,

                     0 = 1 and  =  .

Our building block solutions are
                0(, ) = 0 and (, ) =   cos() +   sin().
                               2

Putting everything together our solution is

                     0  

                     (, ) = +   cos() +   sin().

                     2 =1

We look at the boundary condition in (4.26),

                                                             

                                           0
                     () = (1, ) = +  cos() +  sin().

                                           2 =1

Therefore, to solve (4.26) we expand (), which is a 2-periodic function, as a Fourier
series, and then multiply the th term by . To find the  and the , we compute

      = 1   () cos()  and  = 1   () sin() .
      -                                        -

Example 4.10.1: Suppose we wish to solve

                      = 0, 0   < 1, - <   ,
                     (1, ) = cos(10 ), - <   .

    The () is already expanded, so the solution is

                                            (, ) = 10 cos(10 ).

See the plot in Figure 4.26. The thing to notice in this example is that the effect of a high
frequency is mostly felt at the boundary. In the middle of the disc, the solution is very
close to zero. That is because 10 is rather small when  is close to 0.

Example 4.10.2: Let us solve a more difficult problem. Consider a long rod with circular

cross section of radius 1. Suppose we wish to solve the steady-state heat problem in

the rod. If the rod is long enough, we simply need to solve the Laplace equation in two

dimensions. We put the center of the rod at the origin, and we have exactly the region

we are currently studying--a circle of radius 1. For the boundary conditions, suppose in
Cartesian coordinates  and , the temperature on the boundary is 0 when  < 0, and it is
2 when  > 0.

    Let us set the problem up. As  =  sin(), then on the circle of radius 1, that is, where
 = 1, we have 2 = 2 sin(). So

                              = 0, 0   < 1, - <   ,

    We must now compute the Fourier series for the boundary condition. By now the
reader has plentiful experience in computing Fourier series, and so we simply state that

4.10.3 Poisson kernel

There is another way to solve the Dirichlet problem--with the help of an integral kernel.
That is, we will find a function (, , ) called the Poisson kernel such that

                                  (, ) = 1   (, , ) () .
                                                2 -

While the integral will generally not be solvable analytically, it can be evaluated numerically.

In fact, unless the boundary data is given as a Fourier series already, it may be much easier

to numerically evaluate this formula as there is only one integral to evaluate.
    The formula also has theoretical applications. For instance, as (, , ) will have

infinitely many derivatives, then via differentiating under the integral, we find that the
solution (, ) has infinitely many derivatives, at least when inside the circle,  < 1. By
"having infinitely many derivatives," what you should think of is that (, ) has "no
corners" and all of its partial derivatives of all orders exist and also have "no corners."

    We will compute the formula for (, , ) from the series solution, and this idea can be
applied anytime you have a convenient series solution where the coefficients are obtained

via integration. Hence you can apply this reasoning to obtain such integral kernels for other

equations, such as the heat equation. The computation is long and tedious, but not overly

difficult. Since the ideas are often applied in similar contexts, it is good to understand how

this computation works.

    What we do is start with the series solution and replace the coefficients with the integrals

that compute them. Then we try to write everything as a single integral. We must use a
different dummy variable for the integration and hence we use  instead of .

OK, so we have what we wanted, the expression in the parentheses is the Poisson kernel,
(, , ). However, we can do a lot better. It is still given as a series, and we would really

like to have a nice simple expression for it. We must work a little harder. The trick is to

rewrite everything in terms of complex exponentials. Let us work just on the kernel.

                                

           (, , ) = 1 + 2  cos() cos() + sin() sin()

                            =1

                                

                  = 1 + 2  cos ( - )

                            =1

                     

                  = 1 +   (-) + -(-)

                     =1

                                                            -(-)  .

                  =1+               (-)  +

                     =1                  =1

In the expression above, we recognize the geometric series. Recall from calculus that if  is a
complex number where || < 1, then

                                                  
                                                       = 1 -  .

                                                                    =1

Note that  starts at 1, and that is why we have the  in the numerator. It is the standard
geometric series multiplied by . We can use  = (-), as lo and behold |(-)| =  < 1.
We continue with the computation.

                    (-)  +         -(-) 

(, , ) = 1 +

              =1            =1

                (-)          -(-)
           = 1 1 - +   (-) 1 - +  -(-)
           1 -  (-) 1 - -(-) + 1 - -(-)  (-) +                       1 -  (-)   -(-)

           = 1 -  (-) 1 - -(-)

           = 1 - 2
              1 -  (-) - -(-) + 2

           = 1 - 2 cos( - ) + 2 1 - 2 .

That is a formula we can live with. The solution to the Dirichlet problem using the Poisson

kernel is         (, ) = 1  

                                         1 - 2             2 () .

4.10. DIRICHLET PROBLEM IN THE CIRCLE AND THE POISSON KERNEL                                  271

Sometimes  the  formula  for  the  Poisson  kernel  is  given  together  with  the  constant  1,  in

                                                                                              2

which case we should, of course, not leave it in front of the integral. Sometimes the limits

of the integral are given as 0 to 2; everything inside is 2-periodic in , so this does not

change the integral.

Let us not leave the Poisson kernel without explaining
its geometric meaning. Let  be the distance from (, ) to (1, )                 
                                                                                     (, )
(1, ). This distance  in polar coordinates is given precisely                       

by the square root of 1 - 2 cos( - ) + 2. That is, the                   1

Poisson kernel is really the formula

                         2 1 - 2 .

    One final note we make about the formula is that it is

really a weighted average of the boundary values. First, we
look at what happens at the origin, that is, when  = 0:

                      (0, 0) = 1            1 - 02             2 () 

                              2 - 1 - 2(0) cos(0 - ) + 0
                                  
                              = 1 () .
                              2 -

So (0, 0) is precisely the average value of () and therefore the average value of  on the
boundary. This is a general feature of harmonic functions, the value at some point  is
equal to the average of the values on a circle centered at .

    What the formula says at other points inside the circle is that the value of the solution is
a weighted average of the boundary data (). The kernel is bigger when (1, ) is closer to
(, ). Therefore, when computing (, ), we give more weight to the values () when
(1, ) is closer to (, ) and less weight to the values () when (1, ) far from (, ).

5.1.1 Boundary value problems

In chapter 4, we encountered several different eigenvalue problems such as:
                                              () + () = 0,

with different boundary conditions

(0) = 0                             () = 0      (Dirichlet), or
(0) = 0                             () = 0
(0) = 0                             () = 0      (Neumann), or
(0) = 0                             () = 0
                                                (Mixed), or
                                                (Mixed), . . .

These boundary problems came up in the study of the heat equation  =  when
we were trying to solve the equation by the method of separation of variables in § 4.6.
Dirichlet conditions correspond to applying a zero temperature at the ends, Neumann
means insulating the ends, etc. Other types of endpoint conditions also arise naturally,
such as the Robin boundary conditions

(0) - (0) = 0, () + () = 0,

for some constant . These conditions come up when the ends are immersed in some
medium.

    In the separation of variables computation we encountered an eigenvalue problem and
found the eigenfunctions (). We then found the eigenfunction decomposition of the initial
temperature  () = (, 0),

                                                                             

                                               () = ().

                                                                            =1
274                                       CHAPTER 5. MORE ON EIGENVALUE PROBLEMS

Once we had this decomposition and found suitable () such that (0) = 1 and such
that ()() were solutions to the heat equation, we wrote the solution to the original
problem, including the initial condition, as

                                                                           

                                          (, ) = ()().

                                                                          =1

    To study more general problems with this method, we must study more general
eigenvalue problems. First, we study second-order linear equations of the form

                                          
                                   ()  - () + () = 0. (5.1)

Essentially any second-order linear equation of the form ()+()+() +() = 0
can be written as (5.1) after multiplying by a proper factor.
Example 5.1.1 (Bessel): Put the following equation into the form (5.1):

                                       2 +   + 2 - 2  = 0.

Multiply  both  sides  by  1  to  obtain
                           

                1 2 +   + 2 - 2  =   +  +  - 2  
                                                             2

                                                       =    -   +  = 0.

The Bessel equation turns up for example in the solution of the two-dimensional wave
equation. If you want to see how one solves the equation, you can look at subsection 7.3.3.

    The so-called Sturm-Liouville problem is to seek nontrivial solutions to

                                  
                        ()  - () + () = 0,   <  < ,

                       1() - 2() = 0, (5.2)

                       1() + 2() = 0.

By nontrivial, we again mean a  that is not simply the constant zero (which is always a
solution). In particular, we ask which s allow such nontrivial solutions. The s that admit
nontrivial solutions are called the eigenvalues and the corresponding nontrivial solutions
are called eigenfunctions. The constants 1 and 2 should not both be zero; the same applies
to 1 and 2.

Liouville (1809-1882).

Theorem 5.1.1. Suppose (), (), () and () are continuous on [, ] and suppose () > 0
and () > 0 for all  in [, ]. Then the Sturm-Liouville problem (5.2) has an increasing sequence

of eigenvalues
                                               1 < 2 < 3 < · · ·

such that

                             lim  = +

                             

and such that to each  there is (up to a constant multiple) a single eigenfunction ().
    Moreover, if ()  0 and 1, 2, 1, 2  0, then   0 for all .

    Problems satisfying the hypothesis of the theorem (including the "Moreover") are

called regular Sturm-Liouville problems, and we will only consider such problems here. That
is, a regular problem is one where (), (), () and () are continuous, () > 0,
() > 0, ()  0, and 1, 2, 1, 2  0, where neither 1 = 2 = 0 nor 1 = 2 = 0. Note:
Be careful about the signs. Also be careful about the inequalities for  and , they must be
strict for all  in the interval [, ], including the endpoints!

    When zero is an eigenvalue, we usually start labeling the eigenvalues from 0 rather

than from 1 for convenience. That is, we label the eigenvalues 0 < 1 < 2 < · · · .

Example 5.1.2: The problem  +  = 0, 0 <  < , (0) = 0, and () = 0 is a regular

Sturm-Liouville problem: () = 1, () = 0, () = 1, and we have () = 1 > 0 and

() = 1 > 0. We also have  = 0,  = , 1 = 1 = 1, 2 = 2 = 0. The eigenvalues are
22                             
 = 2 and eigenfunctions are () = sin   . All eigenvalues are nonnegative as

predicted by the theorem.

Exercise 5.1.1: Find eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for

                            +  = 0, (0) = 0, (1) = 0.

Identify the , , ,  , . Can you use the theorem above to make the search for eigenvalues easier?
Hint: Consider the condition -(0) = 0.

Example 5.1.3: Find eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the problem

            +  = 0, 0 <  < 1,                              > 0.
            (0) - (0) = 0, (1) = 0,

These equations give a regular Sturm-Liouville problem.

Exercise 5.1.2: Identify , , ,  ,  in the example above.

By Theorem 5.1.1,   0. So the general solution (without boundary conditions) is

                               

           () =  cos   +  sin                             if  > 0,

           () =  +                                        if  = 0.
276                                         CHAPTER 5. MORE ON EIGENVALUE PROBLEMS

    Let us see if  = 0 is an eigenvalue: We must satisfy 0 =  -  and  = 0, hence  = 0
(as  > 0). Therefore, 0 is not an eigenvalue (no nonzero solution, so no eigenfunction).

    Now we try  > 0. We plug in the boundary conditions:

                                            

                                 0 =  -  ,                    
                                                     

                                 0 = -  sin  +   cos  .

If  = 0, then  = 0 and vice versa; therefore, both are nonzero.    So  =  , and
            
                                                                                     
0 = -  sin  +   cos  . As   0 we get

                                                            

                                 0 = -  sin  +  cos  ,

or  
                                                   = tan .
                                                    

      We use a computer to find . There are tables available, though using a computer or a

graphing calculator is far more convenient nowadays. The easiest method is to plot the

functions / and tan  and see for which  they intersect. There is an infinite number of
intersections. Denote the firstintersectionby 1, the second intersection by 2, etc. For
example, when  = 1, we get 1  0.86, 2  3.43, . . . . That is 1  0.74, 2  11.73, . . . .

A plot for  = 1 is given in Figure 5.1 on the facing page. The appropriate eigenfunction
                                              
(let    =  1  for  convenience,  then    =       is
                                            / )

                   () = cos                                     .
                                                +  sin

                                                          

When  = 1 we get (approximately)

1()  cos(0.86 ) + 1 0.86 sin(0.86 ), 2()  cos(3.43 ) + 1 3.43 sin(3.43 ), . . . .

5.1.2 Orthogonality

We have seen the notion of orthogonality before. For example, we have shown that sin()
are orthogonal for distinct  on [0, ]. For general Sturm-Liouville problems we need
a more general setup. Let () be a weight function (any function, though generally we
assume it is positive) on [, ]. Two functions  (), () are said to be orthogonal with
respect to the weight function () when

                                        
                                                 () () ()  = 0.

                                                             
5.1. STURM-LIOUVILLE PROBLEMS                                                      277

    0    2                                           4               6

         Figure  5.1:            Plot            of  1  and  tan  .
                                                     

In this setting, we define the inner product as

                               

                    def           () () () ,

           ,  =

                               

and then say  and  are orthogonal whenever   ,  = 0. The results and concepts are

again analogous to finite-dimensional linear algebra.
    The idea of the given inner product is that those  where () is greater have more

weight. Nontrivial (nonconstant) () arise naturally, for example from a change of variables.
Hence, you could think of a change of variables such that  = () .

    Eigenfunctions of a regular Sturm-Liouville problem satisfy an orthogonality property,

just like the eigenfunctions in § 4.1. Its proof is very similar to the analogous Theorem 4.1.1

on page 193.

Theorem 5.1.2. Suppose we have a regular Sturm-Liouville problem

         
        () - () + () = 0,

       1() - 2() = 0,
       1() + 2() = 0.

Let  and  be two distinct eigenfunctions for two distinct eigenvalues  and . Then

                                       
                                               () () ()  = 0,

                                                           

that is,  and  are orthogonal with respect to the weight function .
278                         CHAPTER 5. MORE ON EIGENVALUE PROBLEMS

5.1.3 Fredholm alternative

The Fredholm alternative theorem we talked about before (Theorem 4.1.2 on page 194) holds
for all regular Sturm-Liouville problems. We state it here for completeness.

Theorem 5.1.3 (Fredholm alternative). Suppose that we have a regular Sturm-Liouville problem.
Then either

                            
      () - () + () = 0,

     1() - 2() = 0,
     1() + 2() = 0,

has a nonzero solution ( is an eigenvalue), or

                            
      () - () + () =  (),

     1() - 2() = 0,
     1() + 2() = 0,

has a unique solution for any  () continuous on [, ].

    This theorem is used in much the same way as we did before in § 4.4. It is used when

solving more general nonhomogeneous boundary value problems. The theorem does not

help us solve the problem. It tells us when a unique solution exists, so that we know when
to spend time looking for it. To solve the problem, we decompose  () and () in terms

of eigenfunctions of the homogeneous problem, and then solve for the coefficients of the
series for ().

5.1.4 Eigenfunction series

What we want to do with the eigenfunctions once we have them is to compute the
eigenfunction decomposition of an arbitrary function  (). That is, we wish to write

                                                       (5.3)

                             () =  (),

                                        =1

where () are eigenfunctions. We wish to find out if we can represent any function
 () in this way, and if so, we wish to calculate the  (and of course we would want to
know if the sum converges). OK, so imagine we could write  () as (5.3). We will assume

convergence and the ability to integrate the series term by term. Because of orthogonality
5.1. STURM-LIOUVILLE PROBLEMS                                                               279

we have

                                                    

  ,  =  () () ()  =                                            () () () 

                                                      =1

                                                    

                                                   =  () () () 

                                                   =1       

                                                       

                                                   =  () () ()  = , .

                                                       

Hence,                                             

                              =          ,    () () ()                      .
                                                   =                                        (5.4)
                                       ,   () ()              2

    Note that  are known up to a constant multiple, so we could have picked a scalar
multiple of an eigenfunction such that  ,  = 1 (if we had an arbitrary eigenfunction
~, divide it by ~ , ~). When  ,  = 1, we have the simpler form  =   , .

The following theorem holds more generally, but the statement given is enough for our

purposes.

Theorem 5.1.4. Suppose  is a piecewise smooth continuous function on [, ]. If 1, 2, . . . are

eigenfunctions of a regular Sturm-Liouville problem, one for each eigenvalue, then there exist real
constants 1, 2, . . . given by (5.4) such that (5.3) converges and holds for  <  < .

Example 5.1.4: Consider

                                        +  = 0, 0 <  < /2,
                                       (0) = 0, (/2) = 0.

The above is a regular Sturm-Liouville problem, and Theorem 5.1.1 on page 275 says that

if  is an eigenvalue then   0.
    Suppose  = 0. The general solution is () =  + . We plug in the initial conditions

to get 0 = (0) = , and 0 = (/2) = . Hence  = 0 is not an eigenvalue.

    So let us consider  > 0, where the general solution is

                                                                     

                                   () =  cos   +  sin   .

                                                                                            

                                                                                                  
Plugging in the boundary conditions we get 0 = (0) =  and 0 =  ( /2) =   cos  2 .
Since  is zero,  cannot be zero. Hence cos  2 = 0. This means that  2 is an odd    
                                   (2     1) 2         2 .
integral  multiple  of  /2,  i.e.      -        =           Solving  for    we  get

                                                 = (2 - 1)2.
280                                                                               CHAPTER 5. MORE ON EIGENVALUE PROBLEMS

We can take  = 1. Our eigenfunctions are
                                            () = sin (2 - 1) .

A little bit of calculus shows                                                    sin (2 - 1)   2  =  .
                                                                                                         4

                                                                               2

                                                        0

So any piecewise smooth function  () on [0, /2] can be written as

                                                  

                                      () =  sin (2 - 1) ,

               ,          0 sin (2 - 1) 2                                                       0

Note that the series converges to an odd 2-periodic extension of  (). With the regular
                                                                                                   
sine  series,  we  would  expect  a  function                                     with  period  2  2  =  .

Exercise 5.1.3 (challenging): In the example above, the function is defined on 0 <  < /2, yet the
series with respect to the eigenfunctions sin (2 - 1) converges to an odd 2-periodic extension
of  (). Find out how the extension is defined for /2 <  < .

Let us compute an example. Consider  () =  for 0 <  < /2. Some calculus later we

find                                                                                                     4(-1)+1
                          42
                      =  0 (2 - 1)  () sin (2 - 1)  = 2 ,

and so for  in [0, /2],

                                () =                                               4(-1)+1    2 sin (2 - 1) .

                                                                                  =1 (2 - 1)

This is different from the -periodic regular sine series which can be computed to be

                                       () = (-1)+1 sin(2).
                                                      

                                                 =1

Both series converge to  () for 0 <  < /2, but the eigenfunctions involved come from
different eigenvalue problems.

5.1.5 Exercises

Exercise 5.1.4: Find eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of

                                +  = 0, (0) - (0) = 0, (1) = 0.

Exercise 5.1.5: Expand the function  () =  on 0    1 using eigenfunctions of the system

                                    +  = 0, (0) = 0, (1) = 0.

Exercise 5.1.6: Suppose that you had a Sturm-Liouville problem on the interval [0, 1] and came
up with () = sin(), where  > 0 is some constant. Decompose  () = , 0 <  < 1 in
terms of these eigenfunctions.

Exercise 5.1.7: Find eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of  (1) = 0,  (1) = 0.
                   (4) +  = 0, (0) = 0, (0) = 0,

This problem is not a Sturm-Liouville problem, but the idea is the same.

Exercise 5.1.8 (more challenging): Find eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for
                               ( ) +   = 0, (0) = 0, (1) = 0.

Hint: First write the system as a constant-coefficient system to find general solutions. Do note that
Theorem 5.1.1 on page 275 guarantees   0.

Exercise 5.1.101: Find eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
                                    +  = 0, (-1) = 0, (1) = 0.

Exercise 5.1.102: Put the following problems into the standard form for Sturm-Liouville problems,
that is, find (), (), (), 1, 2, 1, and 2, and decide if the problems are regular or not.

   a)   +  = 0 for 0 <  < 1, (0) = 0, (1) = 0.
   b) (1 + 2) + 2  + ( - 2) = 0 for -1 <  < 1, (-1) = 0, (1) + (1) = 0.

     In an earlier version of this book, a typo rendered the equation as (1 + 2) - 2  + ( - 2) = 0
ending up with something harder than intended. Try this equation for a further challenge.

5.2 Higher-order eigenvalue problems

Note: 1 lecture, §10.2 in [EP], exercises in §11.2 in [BD]

    The eigenfunction series can arise even from higher-order equations. Consider an
elastic beam (say made of steel). We will study the transversal vibrations (vibrations where
the beam "bends") of the beam. Suppose the beam lies along the -axis and let (, )
measure the displacement of the point  on the beam at time . See Figure 5.2.

                   

                                              
                                                                            

                     Figure 5.2: Transversal vibrations of a beam.

The equation that governs this setup is

                                               4 4 + 2 = 0,
                                                  4 2

for some constant  > 0, let us not worry about the physics.
    Suppose the beam is of length 1 and simply supported (hinged) at the ends. The beam

is displaced by some function  () at time  = 0 and then let go (initial velocity is 0). Then
 satisfies:

                                4 +  = 0 (0 <  < 1,  > 0),
                                (0, ) = (0, ) = 0,
                                (1, ) = (1, ) = 0, (5.5)
                                (, 0) =  (), (, 0) = 0.

    Again we try (, ) = ()() and plug in to get 4(4) +  = 0 or

                     (4) -
                       = 4 = .

The equations are

                      + 4 = 0 and (4) -  = 0.

     If you are interested, 4 =  , where  is the elastic modulus,  is the second moment of area of the cross
section, and  is linear density.
5.2. HIGHER-ORDER EIGENVALUE PROBLEMS                                  283

The boundary conditions (0, ) = (0, ) = 0 and (1, ) = (1, ) = 0 imply

(0) = (0) = 0 and (1) = (1) = 0.

The initial homogeneous condition (, 0) = 0 implies

                               (0) = 0.

As usual, we leave the nonhomogeneous (, 0) =  () for later.
    Considering the equation for , that is,  + 4 = 0, and physical intuition leads us

to the fact that if  is an eigenvalue then  > 0: We expect vibration and not exponential
growth nor decay in the  direction (there is no friction in our model for instance). So there

are no negative eigenvalues. Similarly  = 0 is not an eigenvalue.

Exercise 5.2.1: Justify  > 0 just from the equation for  and the boundary conditions.

     Let  = 4 , that is, 4 = , to avoid writing the fourth root all the time. Notice  > 0.
The general solution to (4) - 4 = 0 is

() =  + - +  sin() +  cos().

Now 0 = (0) =  +  + , 0 = (0) = 2( +  - ). Solving,  = 0 and  = -. So

                               () =  - - +  sin().

Also 0 = (1) = ( - -) +  sin , and 0 = (1) = 2( - -) - 2 sin . This
means that  sin  = 0 and ( - -) = 2 sinh  = 0. If  > 0, then sinh   0 and so
 = 0. Thus   0, otherwise  is not an eigenvalue. Also,  must be an integer multiple
of . Hence  =  and   1 (as  > 0). We can take  = 1. So the eigenvalues are
 = 44, and corresponding eigenfunctions are sin().

    Now  + 444 = 0. The general solution is () =  sin(222) +  cos(222).
But (0) = 0 and hence  = 0. We take  = 1 to make (0) = 1 for convenience. So our
solutions are () = cos(222).

    The eigenfunctions are just the sines, so we decompose the function  () using the sine
series. That is, we find numbers  such that for 0 <  < 1,

                                                                          

                                             () =  sin().

                                                                         =1

Then the solution to (5.5) is

                               

(, ) =  ()() =  sin() cos(222).

=1                             =1
284              CHAPTER 5. MORE ON EIGENVALUE PROBLEMS

The point is that  is a solution that satisfies all the homogeneous conditions (all
conditions except the initial position). And since (0) = 1,

                         

     (, 0) =  ()(0) =  () =  sin() =  ().

     =1            =1    =1

So (, ) solves (5.5).
    The natural (angular) frequencies of the system are 222. These frequencies are

all integer multiples of the fundamental frequency 22, so we get a nice musical note.
The exact frequencies and their amplitude are what musicians call the timbre of the note
(outside of music it is called the spectrum).

    The timbre of a beam is different from that of a vibrating string where we get "more" of
the lower frequencies since we get all integer multiples, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .. For a steel beam
we get only the square multiples 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . .. That is why when you hit a steel beam
you hear a very pure sound. The sound of a xylophone or vibraphone is, therefore, very
different from that of a guitar or piano.

Example 5.2.1: Consider  () = 10 (-1) . On 0 <  < 1 (you know how to do this by now)

          () =      -4
                         533 sin().
                   =1
                    odd

Hence, the solution to (5.5) with the given initial position  () is

     (, ) =   -4                                               2 22
                   533 sin() cos(   ).
             =1
              odd

    There are other boundary conditions than just hinged ends. There are three basic
possibilities: hinged, free, or fixed. Consider the end at  = 0. For the other end, it is the
same idea. If the end is hinged, then

                                             (0, ) = (0, ) = 0.

If the end is free, that is, it is just floating in air, then
                                           (0, ) = (0, ) = 0.

And finally, if the end is clamped or fixed, for example it is welded to a wall, then
                                             (0, ) = (0, ) = 0.

5.2.1 Exercises

Exercise 5.2.2: Suppose you have a beam of length 5 with free ends. Let  be the transverse
deviation of the beam at position  on the beam (0 <  < 5). You know that the constants are such
that this satisfies the equation  + 4 = 0. Suppose you know that the initial shape of the
beam is the graph of (5 - ), and the initial velocity is uniformly equal to 2 (same for each ) in the
positive  direction. Set up the equation together with the boundary and initial conditions. Just set

up, do not solve.

Exercise 5.2.3: Suppose you have a beam of length 5 with one end free and one end fixed (the

fixed end is at  = 5). Let  be the longitudinal deviation of the beam at position  on the beam

(0 <  < 5). You know that the constants are such that this satisfies the equation  = 4.
                                                                                                                   -(-5)
Suppose  you  know  that  the  initial  displacement  of  the  beam  is  50 -5 ,  and  the  initial  velocity  is    100

in the positive  direction. Set up the equation together with the boundary and initial conditions.

Just set up, do not solve.

Exercise 5.2.4: Suppose the beam is  units long, everything else kept the same as in (5.5). What is
the equation and the series solution?

Exercise 5.2.5: Suppose you have

                               4 +  = 0 (0 <  < 1,  > 0),
                               (0, ) = (0, ) = 0,
                               (1, ) = (1, ) = 0,
                               (, 0) =  (), (, 0) = ().

That is, you have also an initial velocity. Find a series solution. Hint: Use the same idea as we did
for the wave equation.

Exercise 5.2.101: Suppose you have a beam of length 1 with hinged ends. Let  be the transverse
deviation of the beam at position  on the beam (0 <  < 1). You know that the constants are such
that this satisfies the equation  + 4 = 0. Suppose you know that the initial shape of the
beam is the graph of sin(), and the initial velocity is 0. Solve for .

Exercise 5.2.102: Suppose you have a beam of length 10 with two fixed ends. Let  be the transverse
deviation of the beam at position  on the beam (0 <  < 10). You know that the constants are such
that this satisfies the equation  + 9 = 0. Suppose you know that the initial shape of the
beam is the graph of sin2(), and the initial velocity is uniformly equal to (10 - ). Set up the
equation together with the boundary and initial conditions. Just set up, do not solve.

5.3 Steady periodic solutions

Note: 1-2 lectures, §10.3 in [EP], not in [BD]

5.3.1 Forced vibrating string

Consider a guitar string of length . We studied this setup in § 4.7. Let  be the position
on the string,  the time, and  the displacement of the string. See Figure 5.3.

                  

                                             

                  0                                                 

                             Figure 5.3: Vibrating string.

The problem is governed by the wave equation

                              = 2 ,

                             (0, ) = 0, (, ) = 0,                            (5.6)

                             (, 0) =  (), (, 0) = ().

We found that the solution is of the form

                                                                    sin   ,
                      =  cos   +  sin  

                            =1

where  and  are determined by the initial conditions. The natural frequencies of the
                                          
system  are  the  (angular)  frequencies     for  integers      1.

But these are free vibrations. What if there is an external force acting on the string? Let

us assume, say, air vibrations (noise), for example from a second string. Or perhaps from a

jet engine. For simplicity, assume nice pure sound and assume the force is uniform at every
position on the string: The external force as a function of time  is given as 0 cos() as

force per unit mass, we will call this the forcing function. Then our wave equation becomes

(remember force is mass times acceleration)

                              = 2 + 0 cos(),                                 (5.7)

with the same boundary conditions of course.
5.3. STEADY PERIODIC SOLUTIONS                                                      287

Suppose we want to find the solution here that satisfies the equation (5.7) and

                  (0, ) = 0, (, ) = 0, (, 0) = 0, (, 0) = 0.                        (5.8)

That is, the string is initially at rest. First, we find a particular solution  of (5.7) that
satisfies only the conditions (0, ) = (, ) = 0. We define the functions  and  as

                                   () = -(, 0),             () = -  (  , 0).
                                                                        

We then find solution  of (5.6). If we add the two solutions, we find that  =  + 

solves (5.7) with the initial conditions.

Exercise 5.3.1: Check that  =  +  solves (5.7) and the side conditions (5.8).

So the big issue here is to find the particular solution . We look at the equation and

we make an educated guess

                                       (, ) = () cos().

We plug in to get

                              -2 cos() = 2 cos() + 0 cos(),

or -2 = 2 + 0 after canceling the cosine. We know how to find a general solution to

this equation (it is a nonhomogeneous constant-coefficient equation). The general solution

is   0
                                  () =  cos             +  sin         -         .
                                                                              
                                                                                2

The endpoint conditions imply (0) = () = 0. So

                                              0 = (0) =  - 2 0 ,

or  = 2 0 , and also

                           0 = () = 2 0 cos  +  sin  - 2 0 .

Assuming    that  sin(     )  is  not  zero,  we  can  solve  for    to  get
                         

                                                -0     cos         -1
                                                             
                                       2  =  .                                      (5.9)
                                                   sin 

Therefore,                                             cos  - 1

                                  0

Exercise 5.3.2: Check that  works.

     Now  we   get  to  the  point   that    we    skipped.    Suppose  sin(  )        =   0.  What     this  means  is

                                                                                

that  is equal to one of the natural frequencies of the system, i.e. a multiple of the base
               .                                                                     ,
frequency          We   notice   that  if      is  not  equal  to  a  multiple  of         but  is  very  close,  then
                                                                                    

the coefficient  in (5.9) seems to become very large as the denominator goes to zero. But

let us not jump to conclusions just yet because the numerator may also go to zero. When
                                 cos(  )
  =       for     even,  then               =  1,  we   could  simply  take     =   0  to  obtain   a   nice  bounded
                                          
                                          0
solution  of  the  same  form,       =    2    cos      -1     cos(), and so no resonance is happening.

                                                    

Resonance     occurs   only  when    both    cos(  )    =  -1  and    sin(  )   =  0,  that    is,  when      =     for
                                                                                                                  
                                                                              

odd  .  When       is  odd,  if  we  take      approaching      ,     then  the    numerator        in  the  coefficient

 is not going to zero, but the denominator is, so  really does "blow up." We could again

try to explicitly solve for the resonance solution if we wanted to, but it is, in the right sense,

the limit of solutions as  gets close to a resonance frequency. In real life, pure resonance

never occurs anyway.

     The calculation of resonance frequencies above explains why a string begins to vibrate

if the identical string is plucked close by. In the absence of friction this vibration would

get louder and louder as time goes on. On the other hand, you are unlikely to get large

vibration if the forcing frequency is not close to a resonance frequency even if you have

a jet engine running close to the string. That is, the amplitude does not keep increasing

unless you tune to just the right frequency.

     Similar resonance phenomena occur when you break a wine glass using human voice

(yes, this is possible, but not easy) if you happen to hit just the right frequency. However,

a glass has much purer sound, i.e. it is more like a vibraphone, so there are far fewer

resonance frequencies to hit.

     When the forcing function is more complicated, you decompose it in terms of the

Fourier series and apply the result above. You may also need to solve the problem above if

the forcing function is a sine rather than a cosine, but if you think about it, the solution is

almost the same.

Example 5.3.1: Let us do the computation for specific values. Suppose 0 = 1 and  = 1
and  = 1 and  = 1. Then

                         (, ) = cos() - cos(1) - 1 sin() - 1 cos().
                                                      sin(1)

Write  = sin(1) cos(1)-1 for simplicity.
    Then plug in  = 0 to get

                                  () = -(, 0) = - cos  +  sin  + 1,

and after differentiating in  we see that () = -   (, 0) = 0.

Hence to find , we need to solve the problem

                             =  ,
                            (0, ) = 0, (1, ) = 0,
                            (, 0) = - cos  +  sin  + 1,
                            (, 0) = 0.

If we use d'Alembert, we note that the formula that we use to define (, 0) is not odd,
hence it is not a simple matter of plugging in the expression for (, 0) to the d'Alembert
formula directly! You must define  to be the odd, 2-periodic extension of (, 0). Then

our solution is

(, ) = ( + ) + ( - ) + cos() - cos(1) - 1 sin() - 1 cos().                                                                                                   (5.10)

    It is not hard to compute specific values for an odd periodic extension of a function and
hence (5.10) is a wonderful solution to the problem. For example, it is very easy to have a
computer do it, unlike a series solution. A plot is given in Figure 5.4.

5.3.2 Underground temperature oscillations

Let (, ) be the temperature at a certain location at depth  underground at time . See

Figure 5.5.
    The temperature  satisfies the heat equation

 = , where  is the diffusivity of the soil. We
know the temperature at the surface (0, ) from

weather records. Let us assume for simplicity that

        (0, ) = 0 + 0 cos(),                                depth 

where 0 is the yearly mean temperature, and  = 0
is midsummer (you can put negative sign above to Figure 5.5: Underground temperature.
make it midwinter if you wish). 0 gives the typical
variation for the year. That is, the hottest temperature is 0 + 0 and the coldest is 0 - 0.
For simplicity, we assume that 0 = 0. The frequency  is picked depending on the units of
, such that when  = 1 year, then  = 2. For example if  is in years, then  = 2.

    It seems reasonable that the temperature at depth  also oscillates with the same

frequency. This, in fact, is the steady periodic solution, a solution independent of the initial

conditions. So we are looking for a solution of the form

                   (, ) = () cos() + () sin()

for the problem

                           =  , (0, ) = 0 cos().                    (5.11)

    We employ the complex exponential here to make calculations simpler. Suppose we
have a complex-valued function

                          (, ) = () .

We look for an  such that Re  = . To find an , whose real part satisfies (5.11), we look

for an  such that          =   , (0, ) = 0  .

                                                                    (5.12)

Exercise 5.3.3: Suppose  satisfies (5.12). Use Euler's formula for the complex exponential to check
that  = Re  satisfies (5.11).

Substitute  into (5.12).     =   .

Hence,

                           -  = 0,

or
                                                  - 2 = 0,

                     .                     = ± 1+ so you could simplify to  = ±(1 + )                 .

where  = ±              Note   that  ±                                                                2    Hence

                                                 2

the general solution is                                                   

                                    () = -(1+) 2  + (1+) 2  .

We assume that an () that solves the problem must be bounded as    since (, )

should be bounded (we are not worrying about Earth's core!). If you use Euler's formula
to expand the complex exponentials, note that the second term is unbounded (if   0),
while the first term is always bounded. Hence  = 0.
Exercise 5.3.4: Use Euler's formula to show that (1+) 2  is unbounded as   , while

        
-(1+) 2  is bounded as   .

  Furthermore, (0) = 0 since (0, ) = 0. Thus  = 0. This means that

We need to get the real part of , so we apply Euler's formula to get

                                                                 +  sin  -                 .

Then finally                                                 
                           (, ) = Re (, ) = 0- 2  cos  -
                                                                                   .

  Notice the phase is different at different depths. At depth  the phase is delayed by

phase shift             =      we   find  the    depth  in   centimeters  where      the  seasons   are  reversed.

That is, we get the depth at which summer is the coldest and winter is the warmest. We

get approximately 700 centimeters, which is approximately 23 feet below ground.

  Be careful not to jump to conclusions. The temperature swings decay rapidly as you
                                                                                     
dig deeper. The amplitude of the temperature swings is 0-                                 This   function  decays
                                                                                     2 .

very quickly as  (the depth) grows. Let us again take typical parameters as above. We

also assume that our surface temperature swing is ±15 Celsius, that is, 0 = 15. Then the
maximum temperature variation at 700 centimeters is only ±0.66 Celsius.

  You need not dig very deep to get an effective "refrigerator," with nearly constant

temperature. That is why wines are kept in a cellar; you need consistent temperature. The

temperature differential could also be used for energy. A home could be heated or cooled

by taking advantage of the fact above. Even without Earth's core you could heat a home

in the winter and cool it in the summer. Earth's core makes the temperature higher the

deeper you dig, although you need to dig somewhat deep to feel a difference. We did not

take that into account above.

The Laplace transform

6.1 The Laplace transform

Note: 1.5-2 lectures, §7.1 in [EP], §6.1 and parts of §6.2 in [BD]

6.1.1 The transform

In this chapter, we will discuss the Laplace transform. The Laplace transform is a
very efficient method to solve certain ODE or PDE problems. The transform takes a
differential equation and turns it into an algebraic equation. If the algebraic equation
can be solved, applying the inverse transform gives us our desired solution. The Laplace
transform also has applications in the analysis of electrical circuits, NMR spectroscopy,
signal processing, and elsewhere. Finally, understanding the Laplace transform will also
help with understanding the related Fourier transform, which, however, requires more
understanding of complex numbers. We will not cover the Fourier transform.

    The Laplace transform also gives a lot of insight into the nature of the equations we are
dealing with. It can be seen as converting between the time and the frequency domain. For
example, take the standard equation

                                       () + () + () =  ().

We can think of  as time and  () as incoming signal. The Laplace transform will convert
the equation from a differential equation in time to an algebraic (no derivatives) equation,
where the new independent variable  is thought of as the frequency.

    We can think of the Laplace transform as a black box. It eats functions and spits out
functions in a new variable. We write   () = () for the Laplace transform of  ().
It is common to write lower case letters for functions in the time domain and upper case
letters for functions in the frequency domain. We use the same letter to denote that one

     Just like the Laplace equation and the Laplacian, the Laplace transform is also named after Pierre-Simon,
marquis de Laplace (1749-1827).

     Really, it is the "frequency" in terms of complex numbers, but we digress.
294                                       CHAPTER 6. THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

function is the Laplace transform of the other. For example, () is the Laplace transform
of  (). Let us define the transform.

                                                          

                                                     def        -  () .

                           () = () =

                                                          0

We note that we are only considering   0 in the transform. Of course, if we think of  as
time, there is no problem; we are generally interested in finding out what will happen in
the future (the Laplace transform is one place where it is safe to ignore the past). Let us
compute some simple transforms.

Example 6.1.1: Suppose  () = 1, then

                            -                             -                 - - 1    = 1.
                                       = lim                         = lim  - -         
     {1} =            -  =
                            - =0                          - =0 
                0

The limit (the improper integral) only exists if  > 0. So {1} is only defined for  > 0.

Example 6.1.2: Suppose  () = -, then

                                                                  -(+)               1.
                                                                                  =
      -            =     - -  =           -(+)  =                 -( + ) =0  + 

                      0                0

The limit only exists if  +  > 0. So  - is only defined for  +  > 0.

Example 6.1.3:  Suppose   () = , then using integration by parts

                               

                         {} =          - 

                                       0                     1  

                                       --                         -
                            =                             +        
                                        =0  0
                            = 0 + 1 - 
                                        - =0

                            = 21 .

Again, the limit only exists if  > 0.

Example 6.1.4: A common function is the unit step function, which is sometimes called the
Heaviside function. This function is generally given as

                               () = 0 if  < 0,
                                         1 if   0.

     The function is named after the English mathematician, engineer, and physicist Oliver Heaviside
(1850-1925). Only by coincidence is the function "heavy" on "one side."
6.1. THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM                                                           295

Let us find the Laplace transform of ( - ), where   0 is some constant. That is, it is

the function that is 0 for  <  and 1 for   .

                                                         -                        -

 ( - )                   =         -( - )  =       -  =  - = =  ,

                            0                  

where of course  > 0 (and   0 as we said before).

    By applying similar procedures, we can compute the transforms of many elementary
functions. Many basic transforms are listed in Table 6.1 (see also appendix B).

                     ()    ()       ()                     ()

                                   sin()                    
                                   cos()                 2+2
                    2     1        sinh()
                    3    2         cosh()                    
                          2        ( - ) (  0)           2+2
                    -    3
                          6                                 
                         4                               2-2
                          !
                          +1                                 
                           1                             2-2
                         +                               -

                                                           

                    Table 6.1: Some Laplace transforms (, , and  are constants).

Exercise 6.1.1: Verify Table 6.1.

    Since the transform is defined by an integral, we can use the linearity properties of the
integral. For example, if  is a constant, then

                                               

   () =                            -   ()  =       -  ()  =   () .

                            0                  0

So we can "pull out" a constant from the transform. Similarly, with addition. As linearity
is important, we state it as a theorem.

Theorem 6.1.1 (Linearity of the Laplace transform). If , , and  are constants, then

                            () + () =   () +  () ,

and in particular,

                                      () =   () .

Exercise 6.1.2: Verify the theorem. That is, show that    ()+() =   () + () .
296                                                 CHAPTER 6. THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

    These rules together with Table 6.1 on the previous page make it easy to find the Laplace
transform of a whole lot of functions already. For example:

              2 + 5 + 9-2 =  2 + 5  + 9 -2 = 2 + 25 + 9  + 2 .

Be careful! The Laplace transform of a product is not the product of the transforms. In

general

                                    ()()    ()  () .

Moreover,    not  all  functions  have  a  Laplace  transform.  For  example,  the  function  1  does
                                                                                              

not have a Laplace transform as the integral diverges for all . Similarly, tan  or 2 do not

have Laplace transforms.

6.1.2 Existence and uniqueness

When does the Laplace transform exist? A function  () is of exponential order as  goes to

infinity if                                |  ()|   ,

for some constants  and , for sufficiently large  (say for all  > 0 for some 0). The
simplest way to check this condition is to try and compute

                                                            ()
                                                     lim  .
                                                      

If the limit exists and is finite (usually zero), then  () is of exponential order.

Exercise 6.1.3: Use L'Hopital's rule from calculus to show that a polynomial is of exponential order.
Hint: Note that a sum of two exponential-order functions is also of exponential order. Then show
that  is of exponential order for any .

    For an exponential-order function, we have existence and uniqueness of the Laplace
transform.

Theorem 6.1.2 (Existence). Let  () be continuous on the interval [0, ) and of exponential order
for a certain constant . Then () =   () is defined for all  > .

    The existence is not difficult to see. Let  () be of exponential order, that is, |  ()|  

for all  > 0 (for simplicity 0 = 0). Let  > , or in other words ( - ) > 0. By the comparison
theorem from calculus, the improper integral defining   () exists because the following

integral exists

                                                                -(-)  
                                                                -( - ) =0 =  -  .
                  -()  =                      -(-)  = 

             0                             0

    The transform also exists for some other functions that are not of exponential order, but
that will not be relevant to us. Before dealing with uniqueness, we note that for functions
of exponential order, their Laplace transform decays at infinity:

                                              lim () = 0.

                                              
6.1. THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM                                            297

Theorem 6.1.3 (Uniqueness). Let  () and () be continuous and of exponential order. Suppose
that there exists a constant , such that () = () for all  > . Then  () = () for all   0.

    Both theorems hold for piecewise continuous functions as well. Recall that piecewise
continuous means that the function is continuous except perhaps at a discrete set of points,
where it has jump discontinuities like the Heaviside function. The Laplace transform,
however, does not "see" values at the discontinuities. So we can only conclude that
 () = () outside of discontinuities. For example, the unit step function is sometimes
defined using (0) = 1/2. This new step function, however, has the exact same Laplace
transform as the one we defined earlier, where (0) = 1.

6.1.3 The inverse transform

As we said, the Laplace transform will allow us to convert a differential equation into an
algebraic equation. Once we solve the algebraic equation in the frequency domain, we will
want to get back to the time domain, as that is what we are interested in. Given a function
(), we wish to find a function  () such that   () = (). Theorem 6.1.3 says that the
solution  () is unique. So we can without fear make the following definition.

    Suppose () =   () for some function  (). Define the inverse Laplace transform as

                                 -1  def
                                  () =  ().

There is an integral formula for the inverse, but it is not as simple as the transform itself--it
requires complex numbers and path integrals. For us it will suffice to compute the inverse
using Table 6.1 on page 295.

Example 6.1.5:  Take () =   1    Find the inverse Laplace transform.

                           +1 .

We look at the table to find

                                 -1 1 = - .
                                        +1

As the Laplace transform is linear, the inverse Laplace transform is also linear. That is,

                -1 () + () = -1 () + -1 () .

Of course, we also have -1 () = -1 () .
Example 6.1.6: Take () = 3+ 2++1 . Find the inverse Laplace transform.

    First we use the method of partial fractions to write  in a form where we can use Table 6.1
on page 295. We factor the denominator as (2 + 1) and write

                                           3  +  =  + 2 2 +  + 1   +  + . 1

Putting the right-hand side over a common denominator and equating the numerators,
we get (2 + 1) + ( + ) = 2 +  + 1. Expanding and equating coefficients, we obtain
298  CHAPTER 6. THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

 +  = 1,  = 1,  = 1, and thus  = 0. In other words,
                                       () = 3  +  =  + 2 2 +  + 1 1 1+ .1

By linearity of the inverse Laplace transform, we get
                       3 -1  +  =   +  2 + 1 = 1 + sin 2 +  + 1 -1 1 -1 1 .

Another useful property is the so-called shifting property or the first shifting property

      -  () = ( + ),

where () is the Laplace transform of  ().

Exercise 6.1.4: Derive the first shifting property from the definition of the Laplace transform.

    The shifting property can be used, for example, when the denominator is a more
complicated quadratic that may come up in the method of partial fractions. We complete
the square and write such quadratics as ( + )2 +  and then use the shifting property.
Example 6.1.7: Find -1 2+41+8 .

    First, we complete the square to make the denominator ( + 2)2 + 4. We find

                               2 -1 1+ 4 = 12  2 + 22 -1 2 = 12 sin(2).

Finally, we put it all together with the shifting property to find

                       2 -1 1 + 4 + 8 =  ( + 2)2 -1 1 + = 1 -2 4 2 sin(2).

    Often, we want to be able to apply the inverse Laplace transform to rational functions,
that is, functions of the form

                                                        ()
                                                        ()

where () and () are polynomials. If () () is the Laplace transform of an exponential-
order function, it goes to zero as   , and so the degree of () must be smaller than
that of (). Such rational functions are called proper rational functions and we can always
apply the method of partial fractions without polynomial division. Of course, we still need
to be able to factor the denominator into linear and quadratic terms, which involves finding
the roots of the denominator.

6.2 Transforms of derivatives and ODEs

Note: 2 lectures, §7.2-7.3 in [EP], §6.2 and §6.3 in [BD]

6.2.1 Transforms of derivatives

Let us see how the Laplace transform is used for differential equations. First we find the

Laplace transform of the derivative of a function. Suppose () is a differentiable function
of exponential order, that is, |()|   for some  and . So  () exists, and what
is more, lim - () = 0 when  > . Then
                                  

 () =     - ()  = - () - (-) - ()  = -(0) +  () .
                                 =0 0
       0

We repeat this procedure for higher derivatives. The results are listed in Table 6.2. The
procedure also works for continuous piecewise smooth functions, that is, functions that
are continuous with a piecewise continuous derivative.

           ()    () = ()
          ()
          ()   () - (0)
          ()   2() -  (0) - (0)
               3() - 2 (0) -  (0) - (0)

       Table 6.2: Laplace transforms of derivatives (() =  () as usual).

Exercise 6.2.1: Verify Table 6.2.

6.2.2 Solving ODEs with the Laplace transform

Notice that the Laplace transform turns differentiation into multiplication by . It is this
property that makes it useful to apply the transform to differential equations.
Example 6.2.1: Consider the problem

                             () + () = cos(2), (0) = 0, (0) = 1.
We will take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation. By (), we will, as usual,
denote the Laplace transform of ().

                                                () + () =  cos(2) ,
                              2() - (0) - (0) + () = 2 + .4
6.2. TRANSFORMS OF DERIVATIVES AND ODES                 301

We plug in the initial conditions now--making computations more streamlined--to find

                  2() - 1 + () = 2 + .4

We solve for (),  () = (2 + 1)(2  + + 4) 2 1+ .1

We use partial fractions (exercise) to write

                  () = 3 2 1 + - 1 3 2 1 + + 4 2 1+ .1

Now take the inverse Laplace transform to obtain

                  () = 1 cos() - 1 cos(2) + sin().
                  3                           3

    The procedure for linear constant-coefficient equations is as follows: Take an ordinary
differential equation in the time variable . Apply the Laplace transform to transform the
equation into an algebraic (non differential) equation in the frequency domain. All the (),
(), (), and so on, will be converted to (), () - (0), 2() - (0) - (0), and
so on. Solve the equation for (). Then taking the inverse transform, if possible, find ().

    It should be noted that since not every function has a Laplace transform, not every

equation can be solved in this manner. Also if the equation is not a linear constant-coefficient

ODE, then applying the Laplace transform may not give us an algebraic equation.

6.2.3 Using the Heaviside function

Before we move on to more general equations than those we could solve before, we want to
consider the Heaviside function. See Figure 6.1 on the following page for the graph.

                                              () = 0 if  < 0,
                                                        1 if   0.

    The Heaviside function is useful for putting other functions together or cutting functions
off. Usually we use ( - ) for some constant ; we just shift the graph to the right by .
That is, ( - ) = 0 when  <  and ( - ) = 1 when   . For example, suppose  () is
a "signal", and we started receiving sin  at time  = . The function  () is then defined as

                                             () = 0 if  < ,
                                                      sin  if   .

Using the Heaviside function,  () can be written as

                                               () = ( - ) sin .

           Figure 6.1: Plot of the Heaviside (unit step) function ().

Similarly, the step function that is 1 on the interval [1, 2) and 0 elsewhere is written as

                                               ( - 1) - ( - 2).

With the Heaviside function we can express functions defined piecewise. If  () =  when
 is in [0, 1],  () = - + 2 when  is in [1, 2], and  () = 0 otherwise, then you write

                        () =  () - ( - 1) + (- + 2) ( - 1) - ( - 2) .

How does the Heaviside function interact with the Laplace transform? We saw that

(for   0)                            -
                  ( - ) =  .

This computation can be generalized into a shifting property or second shifting property:

             ( - ) ( - ) = -  ()        (  0).                         (6.1)

For example,

              ( - 1) =  ( - 1) + 1 ( - 1) = -  + 1 =  2 - 1 + 1 .

Example 6.2.2: Consider the mass-spring system

                               () + () =  (), (0) = 0, (0) = 0,

where  () = 1 if 1   < 5 and zero otherwise. The function  () is not periodic and
defined piecewise; no problem for Laplace. Imagine a rocket attached to the mass is fired
for 4 seconds starting at  = 1. Or perhaps imagine an RLC circuit, where the voltage is
raised at a constant rate for 4 seconds starting at  = 1 and then held steady again starting
at  = 5 (recall that  () represents the derivative of the voltage in the RLC circuit).
6.2. TRANSFORMS OF DERIVATIVES AND ODES                             303

We write  () = ( - 1) - ( - 5). We transform the equation and we plug in the initial

conditions as before                                 - -5
                               2() + () =  -  .

We solve for (),                  -                     -5

                               () = (2 + 1) - (2 + 1) .

We leave it as an exercise to the reader to show that

                                (2 -1 1+ 1) = 1 - cos .

In other words, {1 - cos } = (2+1) 1 . Using the second shifting property (6.1), we find
              -1  = -1 - - {1 - cos } = 1 - cos( - 1) ( - 1).
                      (2 + 1)

Similarly,

            -1  = -1 -5 -5 {1 - cos } = 1 - cos( - 5) ( - 5).
                   (2 + 1)

Hence, the solution is

            () = 1 - cos( - 1) ( - 1) - 1 - cos( - 5) ( - 5).

The plot of this solution is given in Figure 6.2.

6.2.4 Transfer functions

The Laplace transform leads to the following useful concept for studying the steady-state
behavior of a linear system. Consider an equation of the form

                                                     =  (),

where  is a linear constant-coefficient differential operator. Then  () is usually thought
of as input of the system and () is thought of as the output of the system. For example,
for a mass-spring system the input is the forcing function and the output is the behavior of
the mass. We would like to have a convenient way to study the behavior of the system for
different inputs.

    Let us suppose that all the initial conditions are zero. We take the Laplace transform of
the equation to obtain, for some (),

                                                ()() = ().

Solving for the ratio ()/() gives the so-called transfer function () = 1/(), that is,
                                                            ()

                                                  () = () .

In other words, () = ()(). We get an algebraic dependence of the output of the

system based on the input. We can now easily study the steady-state behavior of the

system given different inputs by simply multiplying by the transfer function. Moreover, it
is possible to compute the () without knowing exactly what the equation is by observing
the output () for a given input (). Once () is known, you can find the output for

any input.

Example 6.2.3: Given  + 20 =  () (assume the initial conditions are zero), let us find
the transfer function.

    First, we take the Laplace transform of the equation,

                                    2() + 02() = ().

Now we solve for the transfer function ()/(),

                                    () = () () = 2 + 2 1 .0

    Let us see how to use the transfer function. Suppose we have the constant input  () = 1.
Hence () = 1/, and

                                        () = ()() = 2 1 1 .
                                                                 2 + 0 

Taking the inverse Laplace transform of (), we obtain

                                         () = 2 1 - cos(0) .
                                                        0

Similarly,  for  any  other  input  (),  the  output  is  ()  =  ()()  =     1   ().
                                                                          2+2
                                                                              0

6.2.5 Transforms of integrals

A feature of Laplace transforms is that it is also able to easily deal with integral equations.

That is, equations in which integrals rather than derivatives of functions appear. The basic

property, which can be proved by applying the definition and doing integration by parts, is

                                 
                            ()  = 1 ().
                                          
                                 0

It is sometimes useful (e.g. for computing the inverse transform) to write this as

                                  ()  = -1 1 () .

                              0           

Example 6.2.4: To compute -1         1  , we could apply this integration rule:
                                 (2+1)

                                                                 
             2 -1 1 1+ 1 =  0 2 -1 1+  1  = sin   = 1 - cos . 0

Example 6.2.5: An equation containing an integral of the unknown function is called an

integral equation. Consider  

                                             () -  = () ,

                                                                                  0

where we wish to solve for (). We apply the Laplace transform to get

                                 () - 21 = 1 (),

where () =  () . Thus

                          () = 1 = 1 - 1.
                                    ( - 1)  - 1 

The inverse Laplace transform gives
                                                  () =  - 1.

6.2.6 Periodic functions

The reader might ask: What about periodic functions as our input  ()? That is, a function

 () where  () =  ( + ) for some constant  (the period). Well, let us compute ():

                                        

() =       -  ()  =       -  ()  +        -  () 

        0              0                                                     

                                               

=          -  ()  +       -(+)  ( + )  =                         -  ()  + -     -  () 

      0              0                                        0              0

= -  ()  + - ().

      0
306                            CHAPTER 6. THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

Solving for (), we get                     
                        () = 1 - - 1 -  () . 0

As before, computing the inverse would be more complex and possibly involve consulting
a table. Let us not worry about computing the inverse here.

Example 6.2.6: Suppose  () is a version of the sawtooth, that is, let  () =  for 0   < 1
and use  () =  ( + 1) to extend it periodically. So  () =  - 1 for 1   < 2,  () =  - 2
for 2   < 3, etc. Then  = 1 and a short computation with integration by parts gets

           1 -  1 1            -- - - + 1                         --            1
     () =  -    =                                        =            +           .
           1- 0         1-  -                                     -
                                                   2  2        (1 -  )           2

6.3 Convolution

Note: 1 or 1.5 lectures, §7.2 in [EP], §6.6 in [BD]

6.3.1 The convolution

The Laplace transformation of a product is not the product of the transforms. All hope is

not lost, however. We simply have to use a different type of "product." Take two functions
 () and () defined for   0, and define the convolution of  () and () as

                                

                           def
                       (   )() =  ()( - ) .                                    (6.2)

                                0

As you can see, the convolution of two functions of  is another function of .
Example 6.3.1: Take  () =  and () =  for   0. Then

                                              
                                 (   )() = ( - )  =  -  - 1.

                                                                    0

To solve the integral we did one integration by parts.

Example 6.3.2: Take  () = sin() and () = cos() for   0. Then
                                             

                                (   )() = sin() cos ( - ) .

                                                                   0

Apply the identity

        cos() sin() = 1 sin( + ) - sin( - ) ,
                             2

to get

                       
        (   )() = 1 sin() - sin( - 2) 
                       02
                                                        
                       = 1  sin() - 1 cos( - 2)
                       2                             4
                                                        =0

                       = 1  sin().
                          2

The formula holds only for   0. The functions  , , and    are undefined for  < 0.

     For those that have seen convolution before, you may have seen it defined as (   )() = -    ()( -) .
This definition agrees with (6.2) if you define  () and () to be zero for  < 0. When discussing the Laplace
transform, the definition we gave is sufficient. Convolution does occur in many other applications, however,
where you may have to use the more general definition with infinities.
6.3. CONVOLUTION                                                               309

    Convolution has many properties that make it behave like a product. Let  be a constant
and  , , and  be functions. It is a calculus exercise to verify that

                      =  ,

                    (  )   =   () = (   ),

                    (  + )   =    +   ,

                    (   )   =   (  ).

                                                            
The first property means that (   )() = 0  ()( - )  = 0  ( - )() . The most
interesting property for us is the following theorem.

Theorem 6.3.1. If  () and () are of exponential order, then so is (   )() and

                    

 (   )() =                                       ()( - )  =   ()  () .

                                             0

    In other words, the Laplace transform of a convolution is the product of the Laplace
transforms:  (   )() = ()(), or in reverse, -1 ()() = (   )().
Example 6.3.3: Suppose we wish to find the inverse Laplace transform of

                                              2( + 1) 1 = 2  + 1 1 1 .

We recognize the two entries of Table 6.2:

                   2 -1 1 =  and -1 1  + 1 = - .

Therefore, we convolve  and -,                    
                              2 -1 1 1  + 1     = -(-)  = - +  - 1.

                                                      0

The calculation of the integral involved an integration by parts.

6.3.2 Solving ODEs

The next example demonstrates the full power of the convolution and the Laplace transform.
We can give the solution to the forced oscillation problem for any forcing function as a
definite integral.

Example 6.3.4: Find the solution to

                                  + 20 =  (),     (0) = 0,  (0) = 0,
for an arbitrary function  ().
310                                            CHAPTER 6. THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

    We first apply the Laplace transform to the equation. Denote the transform of () by
() and the transform of  () by () as usual. We get

                                     2() + 02() = (),

or in other words,                    () = 2 1 ().
                                                2 + 0

Recall  that  ()  =     1   is  the  transfer  function.  We  know
                     2+2
                         0

                                      2 + 2 -1 1 = sin(0) . 0 0

Therefore,                        () = sin(0)  ( - ) ,
or, if we reverse the order,                   0
                                         0

                                  () =  () sin 0( - ) .
                                                          0
                                      0

    Notice one more feature of the example above. We can now see how the Laplace
transform handles resonance. Suppose that  () = cos(0). Then

          () = sin(0) cos  1   0( - )  = sin(0) cos 0( - ) .
                     0                                    0 0
              0

We have computed the convolution of sine and cosine in Example 6.3.2. Hence

                         () = 1       12  sin(0) = 1 2  sin( 0 0).
                                   0

Note the  in front of the sine. The solution, therefore, grows without bound as  gets large,

meaning we get resonance.
    The general idea here is that if () is the transfer function, then () = ()(). If we

find the () = -1 () , then

                                                                           
             () = -1 () = -1 ()() = (   )() =  ()( - ) .

                                                                                                              0

Hence, we can solve any constant-coefficient equation with an arbitrary forcing function
 () as a definite integral using convolution. A definite integral, rather than a closed form

solution, is usually enough for most practical purposes. It is not hard to numerically

evaluate a definite integral.
6.3. CONVOLUTION                                                        311

6.3.3 Volterra integral equation

An integral equation involving convolution that comes up, for example, when studying
systems with memory effects is the Volterra integral equation

                                                    
                                      () =  () + ( - )() .

                                                                              0

Here  () and () are known functions and () is an unknown we wish to solve for. We
have () =  () + (  )(), so the question is if convolution is like a product, can we also
"divide" to solve this equation. We apply the Laplace transform to the equation to obtain

                                            () = () + ()(),

where (), (), and () are the Laplace transforms of (),  (), and () respectively.

We find                               ()
                           1 () = - () .

To find (), we now need to find the inverse Laplace transform of ().

Example 6.3.5: Solve                 
                      () = - + sinh( - )() .

                                              0

    We apply the Laplace transform to obtain

                      () = 1  + 1 + 2 1- (), 1

or                    1           -1                   

                      +1                                   1
                      1 - 2 () = 1 = 2 - 2 = 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 .
                       -1

It is not hard to apply Table 6.1 on page 295 to find

                                              1          

                      () = cosh 2  -  sinh 2  .

6.4 Dirac delta and impulse response

Note: 1 or 1.5 lecture, §7.6 in [EP], §6.5 in [BD]

6.4.1 Rectangular pulse

Often we study a physical system by putting in a short pulse and then seeing what the
system does. The resulting behavior is often called impulse response, and understanding it
tells us how the system responds to any input. Let us see what we mean by a pulse. The
simplest kind of a pulse is a simple rectangular pulse defined by

                                          0    if  < ,
                                               if    < ,
                                  () =  0      if   .

See Figure 6.3 for a graph.                           0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0
    Notice that
                                                 2.0                                     2.0
        () =  ( - ) - ( - ) ,

where () is the unit step function. Let us 1.5                                           1.5

take the Laplace transform of a rectangular

pulse,                                           1.0                                     1.0

 ()     =   ( - ) - ( - )                        0.5                                     0.5
              - - -
                                                 0.0                                     0.0
        =  .

                                                      0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0

    For simplicity, let  = 0.     We also set    Figure 6.3: Sample rectangular pulse with  = 0.5,
 = 1/ so that                                     = 1, and  = 2.

                
                        ()  = 1.

                          0

That is, we have a pulse of "unit mass." This way for any  the pulse has the same "oomph."

For such a pulse,

                    () =  () - ( - ) = 1 - - .
                                                                

We want  to be very small; we wish to have the pulse be very short and very tall. By
letting  go to zero, we arrive at the concept of the Dirac delta function. The limit of 1  --
as   0 is 1, so we are looking for a "function" whose Laplace transform is 1.
314                        CHAPTER 6. THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

6.4.2 The delta function

The Dirac delta function is not exactly a function; it is sometimes called a generalized function.
We avoid unnecessary details and simply say that it is an object that does not really make
sense unless we integrate it. The motivation is that we would like a "function" () such
that for any continuous function  (),

                                          
                                                  ()  ()  =  (0).

                                                               -

The formula should hold if we integrate over any interval that contains 0, not just (-, ).
So () is a "function" with all its "mass" at the single point  = 0. For any interval [, ],

          ()  = 1 if the interval [, ] contains 0, i.e.   0  ,
             0 otherwise.

Unfortunately there is no such function in the classical sense. You could informally think

that () is zero for   0 and somehow infinite at  = 0.

A good way to think about () is as a limit of pulses of decreasing length whose integral

is 1. For example, consider a rectangular pulse () as above with  = 0 and  = 1/, that
is, () =  ()-(-) . Compute

            ()  ()  = () - ( - )  ()  = 1    () .
                                                            0
          -       -

If  () is continuous at  = 0, then for very small , the function  () is approximately equal

to  (0) on the interval [0, ]. We approximate the integral

                           
             1  ()   1  (0)  =  (0).
             0             0

Hence,                        

             lim ()  ()  = lim 1  ()  =  (0).
             0 -           0  0

Let us therefore accept () as an object that is possible to integrate. We often want to

shift  to another point, for example ( - ). In that case,
                                       

                     ( - )  ()  =  ().

                  -

Note that ( - ) is the same object as ( - ). With that, the convolution of () with  ()
is again  (),  

                                  (   )() =  ()( - )  =  ().

                                                                      0

Named after the English physicist and mathematician Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac (1902-1984).  +
 It is important that we consider  and  as part of the interval. One could write this integral as - .

As we can integrate (), we compute its Laplace transform:

                                     

                        ( - )     =      - ( - )  = - .

                                      0

In particular,

                                   () = 1.

Remark 6.4.1: The Laplace transform of ( - ) would be the Laplace transform of the
derivative of the Heaviside function ( - ), if the Heaviside function had a derivative.

First,                                     -
                        ( - ) =  .

To obtain what the Laplace transform of the derivative would be, we multiply by , to obtain
-, which is the Laplace transform of ( - ). We see the same thing using integration,

                       

                            ( - )  = ( - ).

                         0

So in a certain sense  "  ( - ) = ( - ). "
                           

This line of reasoning allows us to talk about derivatives of functions with jump discontinu-
ities. We can think of the derivative of the Heaviside function ( - ) as being somehow
infinite at , which is precisely our intuitive understanding of the delta function.

Example 6.4.1: Let us compute -1  +1     . So far we only computed the inverse transform
                                   

of proper rational functions in the  variable. That is, the numerator was of lower degree
than the denominator. Not so with +1 . We can use the delta function to compute,

                -1  + 1  = -1 1 + 1 = -1{1} + -1 1 = () + 1.

The resulting object is a generalized function and only makes sense when put underneath
an integral.

6.4.3 Impulse response

As we said before, in the differential equation  =  (), we think of  () as input, and ()
as the output. We think of the delta function as an impulse, and so to find the response to
an impulse, we use the delta function in place of  (). The solution to

                                                      = ()

is called the impulse response.
316                                          CHAPTER 6. THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

Example 6.4.2: Solve (find the impulse response)

                    + 20 = (), (0) = 0, (0) = 0.                                        (6.3)

Apply the Laplace transform to the equation, and denote the transform of () by ():

                        2() + 02() = 1, and so               () = 2 + 2 1 .0
The inverse Laplace transform produces (for  > 0)

                                                () = sin(0) .
                                                             0

Remark 6.4.2: Perhaps an astute reader will notice that it does not seem like (0) = 0.
However, we really want to think of as () = 0 for   0, so () has a "corner" at  = 0,
that is,  has a jump discontinuity there, which is what produces the () when we take
. See Remark 6.4.1. The initial condition really is (0-) = lim0 (0) = 0.

Let us notice something about the example above. In Example 6.3.4, we found that

when the input is  (), the solution to  =  () is given by

                     () =  () sin 0( - ) .
                                                       0
                                     0

That is, the solution for an arbitrary input is given as convolution with the impulse response. Let

us see why. The key is to notice that for functions  () and (),

     (   )() = 2  ()( - )  =  ()( - )  = (   )().    
             2 0
                                                       0

We simply differentiate twice under the integral. Suppose that () is the impulse response

(solution to  + 20  = ()). If we convolve the entire equation (6.3), the left-hand side

becomes

             (  +  02 )      =  (    )  +    2  (      )  =  (    )  +    2  (      ).
                                             0                            0

The right-hand side becomes

                                     (   )() =  ().

Therefore, if  is the impulse response, then () = (   )() is the solution to

                                                 + 20 =  ().

    The procedure works for any constant-coefficient linear equation  =  (). If you find
the impulse response  (solution to  = ()), you also know how to obtain the output
() for any input  (). We simply convolve, () = (   )(). As you may have noticed

in the example, the impulse response is in fact just the inverse Laplace transform of the
transfer function, that is, () = -1 () .

     You should really think of the integral going over (-, ) rather than over [0, ] and simply assume
that  () and () are zero for negative .

6.4.4 Three-point beam bending

A quite different example application where the delta function appears is in representing
point loads on a steel beam. Consider a beam of length , resting on two simple supports
at the ends. Let  denote the position on the beam, and let () denote the deflection of the
beam in the vertical direction. The deflection () satisfies the Euler-Bernoulli equation,

                                                     4
                                                  4 = (),

where  and  are constants and () is the force applied per unit length at position . The
situation we are interested in is when the force is applied at a single point as in Figure 6.4.

                                ( - )

                                                        

                      Figure 6.4: Three-point bending.

The equation becomes

                         4
                       4 = -( - ),

where  =  is the point where the mass is applied. The constant  is the force applied and
the minus sign indicates that the force is downward, that is, in the negative  direction.

The end points of the beam satisfy the conditions,

                      (0) = 0,  (0) = 0,
                      () = 0,   () = 0.

See § 5.2 for further information about endpoint conditions applied to beams.
Example 6.4.3: Suppose that length of the beam is 2, and  = 1 for simplicity. Further
suppose that the force  = 1 is applied at  = 1. That is, we have the equation

                                                4
                                                4 = -( - 1),

and the endpoint conditions are

                        (0) = 0, (0) = 0, (2) = 0, (2) = 0.

     Named for the Swiss mathematicians Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705), Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782), the
nephew of Jacob, and Leonhard Paul Euler (1707-1783).

      is the elastic modulus and  is the second moment of area. Let us not worry about the details and
simply think of these as some given constants.
318                                   CHAPTER 6. THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

We could integrate, but using the Laplace transform is even easier. We apply the

transform in the  variable rather than the  variable. We again denote the transform of

() by ().  4() - 3(0) - 2(0) -  (0) - (0) = -- .

We notice that (0) = 0 and (0) = 0. Let us call 1 = (0) and 2 = (0). We solve for

(),                              -- 1 2

                        () =          + +.
                                   4  2  4

We take the inverse Laplace transform utilizing the second shifting property (6.1) to take
the inverse of the first term:

                        () = -( - 1)3 ( - 1) +   1 + 2 3.
                           6                   6

We still need to apply two of the endpoint conditions. As the conditions are at  = 2 we
can simply replace ( - 1) = 1 when taking the derivatives. Therefore,

           0 = (2) = -(2 - 1)3 +   1(2) + 2 23 = -1 + 2 4 1 + 2,
                        6             6     6              3

0 =  and (2) = -3 · 2 · (2 - 1) + 2 3 · 2 · 2 = -1 + 22.
                              6       6

Hence, 2 = 12 . Solving for 1 using the first equation, we obtain 1 = -14 . Our solution for

the beam deflection is  () = -( - 1)3 ( - 1) -  + 3 .

6.5 Solving PDEs with the Laplace transform

Note: 1-1.5 lecture, can be skipped

    The Laplace transform comes from the same family of transforms as does the Fourier
series, which we used in chapter 4 to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). It is
therefore not surprising that we can also solve PDEs with the Laplace transform.

    Given a PDE in two independent variables  and , we use the Laplace transform on
one of the variables (taking the transform of everything in sight), and derivatives in that
variable become multiplications by the transformed variable . The PDE becomes an ODE,
which we solve. Afterwards, we invert the transform to find a solution to the original
problem. It is best to see the procedure on an example.

Example 6.5.1: Consider the first-order PDE

                                       = - , for  > 0,  > 0,

with side conditions

                      (0, ) = , (, 0) = 0.

We will assume  > 0 is a constant. This equation is called the convection equation or

sometimes the transport equation, and it already made an appearance in § 1.9, with different

conditions. See Figure 6.5 for a diagram of the setup.

    A physical setup of this equation is a river              = -
                                                     =
of viscous goo, as we do not want anything to
diffuse. The function  is the concentration of
some toxic substance. The variable  denotes
position where  = 0 is the location of a

factory spewing the toxic substance into the

river. The toxic substance flows into the river

so that at  = 0 the concentration is always .        (0, 0)   =0   
We wish to see what happens past the factory,

that is, at  > 0. Let  be the time, and assume       Figure 6.5: Transport equation on a half line.
the factory started operations at  = 0, so that

at  = 0 the river is just pure goo.

Consider a function of two variables (, ). Let us fix  and transform the  variable.

For convenience, we treat the transformed  variable as a parameter, since there are no

derivatives in . That is, we write () for the transformed function, and treat it as a

function of , leaving  as a parameter.

                                                  

                      () =  (, ) =                   (, )- .

                                                  0

There is also a Fourier transform on the real line that looks sort of like the Laplace transform.
It's a river of goo already, we're not hurting the environment much more.
6.5. SOLVING PDES WITH THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM                               321

The transform of a derivative with respect to  is just differentiating the transformed

function:

            (, )  = (, )-    =                                      = ().
                                          (, )- 
                  0
                                      0

To transform the derivative in  (the variable being transformed), we use the rules from

§ 6.2:
                                        (, ) = () - (, 0).

In our specific case, (, 0) = 0, and so  (, ) = (). We transform the equation

to find

                                  () = -().

This ODE needs an initial condition. The initial condition is the other side condition of the
PDE, the one that depends on . Everything is transformed, so we must also transform

this condition           (0) =  (0, ) =   =  .
                                                                

We solve the ODE problem () = -(), (0) =  , to find

                                  () =  -   .
                                            

We are not done, we have (), but we really want (, ). We transform the  variable
back to . Let

                                            () = 0 if  < 0,
                                                       1 otherwise

be the Heaviside function. As

                  ( - )  = ( - ) -  = -  =      , -
                                                                  
                               0               

then              (, ) = -1  -   =   - / .
                                      

In other words,

                               (, ) = 0 if  < /,
                                             otherwise.

See Figure 6.6 on the next page for a diagram of this solution. The line of slope 1/ indicates

the wavefront of the toxic substance in the picture as it is leaving the factory. What the
equation does is simply move the initial condition to the right at speed .

    Shhh. . .  is not differentiable, it is not even continuous (nobody ever seems to notice).

How could we plug something that's not differentiable into the equation? Well, just think
322                                          CHAPTER 6. THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

                                   =                wavefront, slope 1/
          =                                  =0

                         (0, 0)           =0          

          Figure 6.6: Wavefront of toxic substance is a line of slope 1/.

of a differentiable function very very close to . Or, if you recognize the derivative of the
Heaviside function as the delta function, then all is well too:

          (, ) =    - /                      =   - / =   - /
                       

and                                  - /  = -    - /         
                   (, ) =                               = -   - / .
                                                            

So  = -.

    The Laplace transform is very good with constant-coefficient equations. One advantage
of Laplace is that it easily handles nonhomogeneous side conditions. Let us try a more
complicated example.

Example 6.5.2: Consider

                          +  +  = 0,         for  > 0,  > 0,
                         (0, ) = sin(),      (, 0) = 0.

Again, we transform , and we write () for the transformed function. As (, 0) = 0,

we find   () + () + () = 0, (0) = 2 1+ .1

The solution of the transformed equation is

                         () = 2 1+ -(+1) 1 = 2 1+ - - . 1

Using the second shifting property (6.1) and linearity of the transform, we obtain the

solution

                                   (, ) = - sin( - )( - ).
6.5. SOLVING PDES WITH THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM                                         323

    We can also detect when the problem is ill-posed in the sense that it has no solution. Let
us change the equation to

-  +  = 0,                       for  > 0,  > 0,
(0, ) = sin(),                    (, 0) = 0.

Then the problem has no solution. First, let us see this in the language of § 1.9. The
characteristic curves are  = - + . If  is the characteristic coordinate, then we find the
equation  = 0 along the curve, meaning a solution is constant along characteristic curves.
But these curves intersect both the -axis and the -axis. For example, the curve  = - + 1
intersects at (1, 0) and (0, 1). The solution is constant along the curve so (1, 0) should
equal (0, 1). But (1, 0) = 0 and (0, 1) = sin(1)  0. See Figure 6.7.

                                  = - + 1
(0, 1) = sin(1)                         is constant along this characteristic curve
                                                                       (1, 0) = 0
                     = sin()

(0, 0)                           =0           

Figure 6.7: Ill-posed problem.

    Now consider the transform. The transformed problem is

                                    -() + () = 0, (0) = 2 1+ ,1

and the solution ought to be
                                                () = 2 1+  . 1

Importantly, this Laplace transform does not decay to zero at infinity! That is, since  > 0
in the region of interest, then

                                            lim 2 1  =   0.
                                              + 1

It almost looks as if we could use the shifting property, but notice that the shift is in the
wrong direction.

    Of course, we need not restrict ourselves to first-order equations, although the compu-
tations become more involved for higher-order equations.
324                                      CHAPTER 6. THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

Example 6.5.3: Let us use Laplace for the following problem:

                        = , 0 <  < ,                > 0,
                       (0, ) =  (),
                       (, 0) = 0.

This problem corresponds to a half-infinite insulated rod with a given heat flux at one
end. The setup would come up in real life in the case of a sufficiently long rod, where
we would not consider a long enough time for our solution to notice that we do not have
an infinite rod but just a very long one. In any case, the real-life situation imposes other
conditions on our solution , for example, we will assume that the solution is bounded.
This boundedness condition will stand in for a boundary condition at the infinite end.
Boundedness is also sufficient for the Laplace transform in the  variable to exist.

    Transform the equation in the  variable to find

                                                 () = ().

The general solution to this ODE is

                                               
                          () =   + - .

Note that  and  depend on . As  is bounded, then () is bounded for any fixed  > 0,

so for () to stay bounded as   , we must have  = 0.

Now consider the boundary condition at  = 0.       Transform (0) = () and so

-  = (). In other words,                   -1    
                                               - 
                          () = ()  .
                                           

If we look up the inverse transform in a table such as the one in Appendix B (or we spend
the afternoon doing calculus), we find

                          -1          1 -       1 -2
                                           =   4 .

                                                

-1 -1 So    -  -1 -2
     (, ) =  ()                          =  ()                 4(-) .
                                                   ( - )
                                           0

    Laplace can solve problems where separation of variables fails. Laplace does not mind
nonhomogeneity, but it is essentially only useful for constant-coefficient equations.

Power-series methods

7.1 Power series

Note: 1.5 or 2 lectures, §8.1 in [EP], §5.1 in [BD]

    Many functions can be written in terms of a power series

                                                                    

                                                      ( - 0).

                                                                   =0

Assuming a solution of a differential equation is a power series, we can perhaps use a
method reminiscent of undetermined coefficients--we try to solve for the numbers .
Before we carry out this process, we review some results and concepts about power series.

7.1.1 Definition

As we said, a power series is an expression such as

                                                           (7.1)

    ( - 0) = 0 + 1( - 0) + 2( - 0)2 + 3( - 0)3 + · · · ,

=0

where 0, 1, 2, . . . ,  , . . . and 0 are constants. Let

                    

  () = ( - 0) = 0 + 1( - 0) + 2( - 0)2 + 3( - 0)3 + · · · + ( - 0) ,

                  =0

denote the so-called partial sum. If for some , the limit

                      

                  lim () = lim ( - 0)
                    
                      =0
328                                              CHAPTER 7. POWER-SERIES METHODS

exists, we say the series (7.1) converges at . At  = 0, the series always converges to 0.
When (7.1) converges at any other   0, we say (7.1) is a convergent power series, and we

write                                            

                               ( - 0) = lim ( - 0) .
                                            
                           =0                    =0

If the series does not converge for any point   0, we say that the series is divergent.

Example 7.1.1: The series

                                1  = 1 +  + 2 + 3 + · · ·
                             =0 !                26

is convergent for any . Recall that ! = 1 · 2 · 3 · · ·  is the factorial. By convention we
define 0! = 1. You may recall that this series converges to .

    We say that (7.1) converges absolutely at  whenever the limit

                                             

                                   lim || | - 0|

                                   
                                           =0

exists. That is, the series =0  || | - 0| is convergent. If (7.1) converges absolutely at ,
then it converges at . However, the opposite implication is not true.

Example 7.1.2: The series              

                                          1 
                                          

                                      =1

                                                                                                                                                    (-1)

converges absolutely for all  in the interval (-1, 1). It converges at  = -1, as =1 

converges (conditionally) by the alternating series test. The power series does not converge
                               
absolutely at  = -1, because   =1  1  does  not  converge.  The  series  diverges  at    =  1.
                                   

7.1.2 Radius of convergence

If a power series converges absolutely at some 1, then for all  such that | - 0|  |1 - 0|
(that is,  is closer than 1 to 0), we have |( - 0)|  |(1 - 0)| for all . As
the numbers |(1 - 0)| sum to some finite limit, summing smaller positive numbers
|( - 0)| must also have a finite limit. Hence, the series must converge absolutely at .

Theorem 7.1.1. For a power series (7.1), there exists a number  (we allow  = ) called the
radius of convergence such that the series converges absolutely on the interval (0 - , 0 + )
and diverges for  < 0 -  and  > 0 + . We write  =  if the series converges for all .

    See Figure 7.1 on the next page. In Example 7.1.1, the radius of convergence is  =  as
the series converges everywhere. In Example 7.1.2, the radius of convergence is  = 1. We
note that  = 0 is another way of saying that the series is divergent.

                            Figure 7.1: Convergence of a power series.

A useful test for convergence of a series is the ratio test. Suppose that

                                                                       

                                                       

                                                                      =0

is a series and the limit           = lim +1
                                         

exists. Then the series converges absolutely if  < 1 and diverges if  > 1.
    We apply this test to the power series (7.1). Let  = ( - 0) in the test. Compute

               = lim +1 = lim +1( - 0)+1 = lim +1 | - 0|.
                                   ( - 0)                       

Define  by

                                    = lim +1 .
                                          

Then the series (7.1) converges absolutely if 1 >  = | - 0|. If  > 0, then the series
converges absolutely if | - 0| < 1/, and diverges if | - 0| > 1/. That is, the radius of
convergence is 1/. If  = 0, then the series always converges.

The root test is similar. Suppose

                                    = lim  ||

                                          

exists. Then        converges     absolutely  if    <  1  and  diverges  if    >  1.  We  can  use  the
              =0
same calculation as above to find . Let us summarize.

Theorem 7.1.2 (Ratio and root tests for power series). Consider a power series

                                                                     

                                                      ( - 0)

                                                                    =0

such that                    = lim +1
                                   
                                              or  = lim  ||

                                                                  

exists. If  = 0, then the radius of convergence of the series is . Otherwise, the radius of
convergence is 1/. Moreover, if either limit for  diverges to , then the series is divergent.
330                                            CHAPTER 7. POWER-SERIES METHODS

Example 7.1.3: Consider                  

                                            2-( - 1) .

                            =0

We compute the limit in the ratio test,

         = lim +1 = lim 2--1 = lim 2-1 = 1 .
                                          2-                         2

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 2, and the series converges absolutely on the interval
(-1, 3). We could just as well have used the root test:

         = lim  || = lim  |2-| = lim 2-1 = 1 .
                                                                     2

Example 7.1.4: Consider                   

                                              1 .
                                             

                                         =0

Compute the limit for the root test (ratio test would also work),

                                                           
         = lim  || = lim  1 = lim  1 = lim 1 = 0.
                                                                  

So the radius of convergence is : The series converges everywhere.

The root or the ratio test as given does not always apply. That is, the limit of        +1    or
                                                                                       

 || might not exist. Sometimes the test must be applied to the series itself--to find the 
                                                   2    2
rather than the . For example, for the series  =1          ,  we  cannot  apply  the  root  with

the , we must work with the limit of  |2 2|, which equals  = 2||2. This  is less than

1 when || < 1 and so 1 is the radius of convergence. Other ways exist to find the radius,
     2  2

but ratio and root tests cover many series arising in practice.

At the endpoints,  = 0 -  and  = 0 + , the series may or may not converge, and the

tests above say nothing about convergence there. Sometimes convergence at the endpoints

is important, but for our purposes, we will not worry about it much.

7.1.3 Analytic functions

Functions represented by power series are called analytic functions. Not all functions are

analytic, but the functions you have seen in calculus likely all are. An analytic function
 () equals its Taylor series (a power series computed from  ) for  near a given point 0:

       ()  ()( = 0) ( -     (0) 0) =  (0) +  (0)( - 0) + ( - 0)2 + · · · ,                    (7.2)
              =0 ! 2

where  ()(0) denotes the th derivative of  () at the point 0.

Named after the English mathematician Sir Brook Taylor (1685-1731).
7.1. POWER SERIES                                                                                331

For example, sine is an analytic function and its Taylor series around 0 = 0 is given by

                                             
                                             (-1) 2+1
                                  sin() = (2 + 1)!  .
                                      =0

In Figure 7.2, we plot sin() and the truncations of the series up to degree 5 and 9. You can
see that the approximation is very good for  near 0, but gets worse for  further away
from 0. This is what happens in general. To get a good approximation far away from 0

you need to take more and more terms of the Taylor series.

7.1.4 Manipulating power series

One of the main properties of power series that we will use is that we can differentiate
them term by term. That is, suppose that ( - 0) is a convergent power series. Then
for  in the radius of convergence, we have

                              

                                        -1                          2
 ( - 0) = ( - 0) = 1 + 22( - 0) + 33( - 0) + · · · .
  =0                          =1

Notice that the term corresponding to  = 0 disappeared as it was constant. The radius of
convergence of the differentiated series is the same as that of the original.

Example 7.1.5: Let us show that the exponential  =  solves  = . Suppose we did not

know that. Write                                       

                                       =  = 1 .
                                                  =0 !
332                                      CHAPTER 7. POWER-SERIES METHODS

Differentiate ,                          

                      =  1 -1 =                    1 -1.
                                 =1 !    =1 ( - 1)!

We reindex the series by simply replacing  with  + 1. The series does not change, what
changes is simply how we write it. After reindexing the series starts at  = 0 again.

                                                          
                     1  -1 =             1 (+1)-1 = 1   .
                 =1 ( - 1)!        +1=1 ( + 1) - 1 !      =0 !

That was precisely the power series for  we started with, so we showed that  [] = .

    Convergent power series can be added and multiplied together, and multiplied by
constants using the following rules. First, we can add series by adding term by term,

                                                      

                     ( - 0) + ( - 0) = ( + )( - 0) .

                 =0                =0                 =0

We can multiply by constants,

                                         

                      ( - 0) = ( - 0).

                             =0          =0

We can also multiply series together,

                                                           

                         ( - 0)            ( - 0)     = ( - 0),

                     =0                =0                 =0

where  = 0 + 1-1 + · · · + 0. The radius of convergence of the sum or the product
is at least the minimum of the radii of convergence of the two series involved.

7.1.5 Power series for rational functions

Polynomials are simply finite power series. That is, a polynomial is a power series where
the  are zero for all  large enough. We can always expand a polynomial as a power series
about any point 0 by writing the polynomial as a polynomial in ( - 0). For example, let
us write 22 - 3 + 4 as a power series around 0 = 1:

                                  22 - 3 + 4 = 3 + ( - 1) + 2( - 1)2.

In other words, 0 = 3, 1 = 1, 2 = 2, and all other  = 0. To do this, we know that  = 0
for all   3 as the polynomial is of degree 2. We write 0 + 1( - 1) + 2( - 1)2, we
expand, and we solve for 0, 1, and 2. We could have also differentiated at  = 1 and
used the Taylor series formula (7.2).
7.1. POWER SERIES                                                                                                                  333

    Let us look at rational functions, that is, ratios of polynomials. An important fact is

that a series for a function only defines the function on an interval even if the function is
defined elsewhere. For example, for -1 <  < 1,

                                      1=        
                                    1-
                                                   = 1 +  + 2 + · · ·

                                            =0

This series is called the geometric series. The ratio test tells us that the radius of convergence

is  1.  The  series  diverges  for      -1  and        1,  even  though       1  is  defined  for  all                             1.
                                                                             1-

    Instead of applying the Taylor series expansion (7.2), the geometric series together with

rules for addition and multiplication of power series can be used to expand any rational
function around a point 0, as long as the denominator is not zero at 0.

Example 7.1.6:       Expand             as a power series around the origin (0          = 0) and find the
                               1+2+2
radius of convergence.

    First, write 1 + 2 + 2 = (1 + )2 = 1 - (-) 2. Compute

                                           = 1 2
                                      1 + 2 + 2            1 - (-)

                                                                          2

                                                     =  (-1) 

                                                           =0

                                                           

                                                     =         

                                                               =0
                                                          

                                                     =   +1,

                                                       =0

where to get , we use the formula for the product of series: 0 = 1, 1 = -1 - 1 = -2,
2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, etc. Therefore

                                        

                                                +1                   2       3       4
                     1 + 2 + 2 = (-1)  =  - 2 + 3 - 4 + · · ·
                                      =1

The radius of convergence is at least 1. We use the ratio test

                     lim +1 = lim (-1)+2( + 1) = lim  + 1 = 1.
                                         (-1)+1                          

So the radius of convergence is actually equal to 1.

    When the rational function is more complicated, it is also possible to use the method of

partial  fractions.  For  example,    to  find  the  Taylor  series  for  3+     we  write

                                                                          2-1 ,

             3 +  =  + 1 - 1 =  + (-1)  -  = - + (-2)    .
             2 - 1 1 +  1 -  =0 =0 =3

                                                                                                                            odd

7.2 Series solutions of linear second-order ODEs

Note: 1.5 or 2 lectures, §8.2 in [EP], §5.2 and §5.3 in [BD]

Consider a linear second-order homogeneous ODE of the form

                     () + () + () = 0.

Suppose that (), (), and () are polynomials. We will try a solution of the form

                             

                      = ( - 0)

                            =0

and solve for the  to try to obtain a solution defined in some interval around 0.
    The point 0 is called an ordinary point if (0)  0. That is, the functions

                     ()            ()
                     () and ()

are defined for  near 0. If (0) = 0, then we say 0 is a singular point. Handling singular
points is harder than ordinary points and so we now focus only on ordinary points.

Example 7.2.1: We start with a very simple example

                          -  = 0.

Let us try a power series solution near 0 = 0, which is an ordinary point. Every point is

an ordinary point in fact, as the equation is a constant-coefficient one. We already know

we should obtain exponentials or the hyperbolic sine and cosine, but let us pretend we do

not know this fact.

We try                           

                          = .

                         =0

If we differentiate, the  = 0 term is a constant and hence disappears. We get

                                                                            

                                                 =   -1.

                                                                           =1

We differentiate yet again to obtain (now the  = 1 term disappears)

                                                                      

                                            = ( - 1) -2.

                                                                     =2

We need to subtract  from , so we reindex the series for  (replace  with  + 2):

                               

                      = ( + 2) ( + 1) +2 .

                              =0
336                                        CHAPTER 7. POWER-SERIES METHODS

Now we plug  and  into the differential equation

                                                                   

                0 =  -  =      ( + 2) ( + 1) +2 -                      

                           =0                                      =0

                           

                        = ( + 2) ( + 1) +2 -  

                           =0
                            

                        = ( + 2) ( + 1) +2 -   .

                           =0

As  -  is supposed to be equal to 0, we know that the coefficients of the resulting series
must be equal to 0. Therefore, for every  = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . ., we have

            ( + 2) ( + 1) +2 -  = 0, or +2 =  ( + 2)( + 1) .

The equation above is called a recurrence relation for the coefficients of the power series. It
does not matter what 0 or 1 are. They can be arbitrary. But once we pick 0 and 1, all

other coefficients are determined by the recurrence relation.

Let us see what the coefficients must be. First, 0 and 1 are arbitrary. Then,

     2 = 0 , 3 = 1 , 4 = 2 = 0 , 5 = 3 =                                      1 , . . .
         2      (3)(2)     (4)(3) (4)(3)(2)                        (5)(4) (5)(4)(3)(2)

For even , that is,  = 2, we have
                                                 = 2 = 0 (2)! .

For odd , that is,  = 2 + 1, we have
                                             = 2+1 = 1 (2 + 1)! .

We write down the series for the solution

                0 2 + 1 2+1                                                 
                                           = 0 1 (2)! 2 + 1 1 (2 + 1)! 2+1.
 =  =           (2)!       (2 + 1)!

     =0     =0                                    =0                        =0

We recognize the two series as the hyperbolic sine and cosine. Therefore,

                            = 0 cosh  + 1 sinh .

    Of course, in general we will not be able to recognize the series that appears, since
usually there will not be any elementary function that matches it. In that case, we will be
content with the series.
Example 7.2.2: Let us do a more complex example. Consider Airy's equation:

                                                    -   = 0,

near the point 0 = 0. Note that 0 = 0 is an ordinary point.

We try

                                        

                                 = .

                                       =0

We differentiate twice (as above) to obtain

                                      

                             =  ( - 1)  -2.

                                     =2

We plug  into the equation

        0 =  -   =                                        
                        =

                                 ( - 1)  -2
                                                 -                   +1 .
                            =2
                                                    =0

We reindex and synchronize the start indexes to make the series possible to add

                                                                             

        0 =  -   = 22 + ( + 2) ( + 1) +2 -                                       -1 

                            =1                                               =1

                            

                = 22 + ( + 2) ( + 1) +2 - -1  .

                            =1

As  -   is supposed to be 0, we have 2 = 0, and  +2 = -1 ( + 2)( + 1) .
                  ( + 2) ( + 1) +2 - -1 = 0, or

We jump in steps of three. First, since 2 = 0, we must have 5 = 0, 8 = 0, 11 = 0, etc. In
general, 3+2 = 0.

    The constants 0 and 1 are arbitrary and we obtain

3 = 0 , 4 = 1 , 6 = 3 =                      0 , 7 = 4 =                              1 , . . .

For  where  is a multiple of 3, that is,  = 3, we notice that

                            3 = 0 (2)(3)(5)(6) · · · (3 - 1)(3) .

For  where  = 3 + 1, we notice

In other words, if we write down the series for , it has two parts

             = 0 1 + 16 3 + 1180 6 + · · · + 1 (2)(3)(5)(6) · · · (3 - 1)(3) 3 + · · ·

We define
            1() = 1 + 16 3 + 1180 6 + · · · + 1 (2)(3)(5)(6) · · · (3 - 1)(3) 3 + · · · ,

and write the general solution to the equation as () = 01() + 12(). If we plug  = 0
into the power series for 1 and 2, we find 1(0) = 1 and 2(0) = 0. Similarly, 1 (0) = 0
and 2 (0) = 1. Therefore  = 01 + 12 is a solution that satisfies the initial conditions
(0) = 0 and (0) = 1.

    The functions 1 and 2 cannot be written in terms of the elementary functions that you
know. See Figure 7.3 for the plot of the solutions 1 and 2. These functions have many
interesting properties. For example, they are oscillatory for negative  (like solutions to
 +  = 0) and for positive  they grow without bound (like solutions to  -  = 0).

    Sometimes a series solution may turn out to be a polynomial. Let us see an example.

Example 7.2.3: Let us find a solution to the so-called Hermite's equation of order :

                             - 2  + 2  = 0.

Let us find a solution around the point 0 = 0. We try

                                               

                                        = .

                                              =0

We differentiate (as above) to obtain

                                      

                             =   -1,

                                     =1
                                      

                             =  ( - 1)  -2.

                                     =2

Now we plug into the equation

0 =  - 2  + 2 

                                                           

=      ( - 1) -2 - 2   -1 + 2  

   =2                                     =1               =0
                                                  
   
                                          2 +        2

   =2                                  =1         =0

                                                                             

= 22 + ( + 2)( + 1)+2 - 2   +                                  20 + 2

       =1                                    =1                             =1

                                                               .

= 22 + 20 + ( + 2)( + 1)+2 - 2  + 2

           =1

As  - 2  + 2  = 0, we have

( + 2)( + 1)+2 + (-2 + 2) = 0, or +2 = (2 - 2) ( + 2)( + 1)  .

This recurrence relation actually includes 2 = -0 (which comes about from the constant
term 22 + 20 = 0). Again 0 and 1 are arbitrary.

           2 = -2 0,                         3 = 2(1 - ) 1,

          (5)(4)         (5)(4)(3)(2)

We separate the even and odd coefficients to find that

          2 =    2(-)(2 - ) · · · (2 - 2 - )                ,

                         (2)!
                 2(1 - )(3 - ) · · · (2 - 1 - )
          2+1 =                                                 .
                         (2 + 1)!

We write down the two series, one with the even powers and one with the odd.

      1() = 1 + 2(-) 2 + 22(-)(2 - ) 4 + 23(-)(2 - )(4 - ) 6 + · · · ,
      2!         4!                                     6!

Then

                 () = 01() + 12().

    We remark that if  is a positive even integer, then 1() is a polynomial as all the
coefficients in the series beyond degree  are zero. If  is a positive odd integer, then 2()
is a polynomial. For example, if  = 4, then

      1() = 1 + 2(-4) 2 + 22(-4)(2 - 4) 4 = 1 - 42 + 4 4.
          2!             4!                                        3

7.3 Singular points and the method of Frobenius

Note: 1.5 or 2 lectures, §8.3 and §8.4 in [EP], §5.4-§5.7 in [BD]
    The behavior of ODEs at singular points can be complicated. For certain singular points,

we can find a solution on at least one side of the singular point using a modification of the
power series. Let us look at some examples before giving a general method.

7.3.1 Examples

Example 7.3.1: Consider the simple first-order equation

                2 -  = 0.

Note that  = 0 is a singular point. Setting  = 0 in the equation, we find that any solution
defined near zero satisfies (0) = 0, but it is even worse. If we try to plug in

                                                                              

                                                   = ,

                                                                             =0

we obtain

                                                         

                0 = 2 -  = 2        -1 -                     

                              =1                         =0

                                

                = -0 + (2  - )  .

                                =1

First, 0 = 0. Next, the only way to solve 0 = 2 -  = (2 - 1)  for  = 1, 2, 3, . . . is for
 = 0 for all . Therefore, in this manner we only get the trivial solution  = 0. We need a

nonzero solution to get the general solution to the equation.
    Let us try  =  for some real number . Consequently our solution--if we can find

one--may only make sense for positive . Then  = -1. So

                0 = 2  -  = 2-1 -  = (2 - 1) .

Thus  = 1/2 and so  = 1/2. As the equation is linear, the general solution for positive  is

                 =  1/2.

If   0, then the derivative of the solution "blows up" at  = 0 (the singular point). There
is only one solution that is differentiable at  = 0 and that's the trivial solution  = 0.

    Not every problem with a singular point has a solution of the form  = , of course.
But perhaps we can combine the methods. What we will do is to try a solution of the form

                                                     =   ()

for positive , where  () is an analytic function (a power series).
7.3. SINGULAR POINTS AND THE METHOD OF FROBENIUS                             343

Example 7.3.2: Consider the equation

                       42 - 42 + (1 - 2) = 0,

and again note that  = 0 is a singular point.

Let us try                                     

                        =    =  + ,

                                  =0           =0

where  is a real number, not necessarily an integer. Again if such a solution exists, it may
only exist for positive . First we find the derivatives

                             

                    = ( + )  +-1,

                            =0
                             

                    = ( + ) ( +  - 1)  +-2.

                            =0

We plug those into our equation:

0 = 42 - 42 + (1 - 2)

                                                                           

= 42 ( + ) ( +  - 1)  +-2 - 42 ( + )  +-1 + (1 - 2)  +

     =0                                        =0                 =0



= 4( + ) ( +  - 1)  +

=0

                                                   

  -         4( + )  ++1 +              + -             2  ++1

     =0                           =0               =0



= 4( + ) ( +  - 1)  +

=0

                                                       

  -         4( +  - 1) -1+ +               + -             2-1 +

     =1                               =0               =1

                   

= 4( - 1) 0 + 0 + 4( + ) ( +  - 1)  - 4( +  - 1) -1 +  - 2-1 +

                   =1

                   

= 4( - 1) + 1 0 +      4( + ) ( +  - 1) + 1  - 4( +  - 1) + 2 -1 + .

                   =1

First, to have a solution we must have 4( - 1) + 1 0 = 0. Supposing 0  0,

                                  4( - 1) + 1 = 0.
344                                          CHAPTER 7. POWER-SERIES METHODS

This equation is called the indicial equation. This particular indicial equation has a double
root at  = 1/2.

    OK, so we know what  has to be. That knowledge we obtained simply by looking at
the coefficient of . All other coefficients of + also have to be zero so

                 4( + ) ( +  - 1) + 1  - 4( +  - 1) + 2 -1 = 0.

If we plug in  = 1/2 and solve for , we get

                         =     4( + 1/2 - 1) + 2      -1 = 1 -1.

                            4( + /2) ( + /2 - 1) + 111      

Let us set 0 = 1. Then

1 = 1 0 = 1, 2 = 1 1 = 1 , 3 = 1 2 = 1 , 4 = 1 3 = 1 , · · ·
     1                    22                 3 3·2            4 4·3·2

Extrapolating, we notice that

                             = 1 = 1 .
                                  ( - 1)( - 2) · · · 3 · 2 !

In other words,

                                                      
                  =   + = 1  +1/2 = 1/2 1   = 1/2  .
                      =0 =0 !                         =0 !

That was lucky! In general, we will not be able to write the series in terms of elementary

functions.
    We have one solution, let us call it 1 = 1/2. But what about a second solution? If we

want a general solution, we need two linearly independent solutions. Picking 0 to be a
different constant only gets us a constant multiple of 1, and we do not have any other  to
try; we only have one solution to the indicial equation. Well, there are powers of  floating
around and we are taking derivatives, perhaps the logarithm (the antiderivative of -1) is

around as well. It turns out we want to try for another solution of the form

                                         

                               2 =  + + (ln )1,

                                        =0

which in our case is                     

                               2 =  +1/2 + (ln )1/2  .

                                        =0

We now differentiate this equation, substitute into the differential equation and solve for
. A long computation ensues and we obtain some recursion relation for . The reader

can (and should) try this to obtain for example the first three terms

                 1 = 0 - 1, 2 = 21 - 1 , 3 = 62 - 1 , . . .
                                    4                   18

We then fix 0 and obtain a solution 2. Then we write the general solution as  = 1+2.

7.3.2 The method of Frobenius

Before giving the general method, let us clarify when the method applies. Let

          () + () + () = 0

be an ODE. As before, if (0) = 0, then 0 is a singular point. If we divide by () to put
the equation in standard form  + () ()  + () ()  = 0, perhaps the singularities introduced
are not too bad. More specifically, if the limits

       lim ( - 0)  ()          and                 lim ( - 0)2 ()

       0           ()                              0          ()

both exist and are finite, then we say that 0 is a regular singular point.
Example 7.3.3: Often, and for the rest of this section, 0 = 0. Consider

          2 + (1 + ) + ( + 2) = 0.

Write

       lim  () = lim  2 (1 + ) = lim (1 + ) = 1,
       0 () 0                                      0

       lim 2 () = lim  2 2 ( +  = lim ( + 2) 2) = .
       0 () 0                                        0

So  = 0 is a regular singular point.
    On the other hand, if we make the slight change

          2 + (1 + ) + ( + 2) = 0,

then   lim  () = lim  2 (1 + ) = lim 1 +  = DNE.

       0 () 0                       0 

Here DNE stands for does not exist. The point 0 is singular, but not a regular singular point.

    We now discuss the general Method of Frobenius. We only consider the method at the

point  = 0 for simplicity. If 0  0, then in the solution, we would replace every  with
( - 0). The main idea is the following theorem.

Theorem 7.3.1 (Method of Frobenius). Suppose that

          () + () + () = 0                                                                 (7.3)

has a regular singular point at  = 0, then there exists at least one solution of the form

                                

                    =  .

                               =0

A solution of this form is called a Frobenius-type solution.

Named after the German mathematician Ferdinand Georg Frobenius (1849-1917).
346                                        CHAPTER 7. POWER-SERIES METHODS

The method usually breaks down like this:

(i) We seek a Frobenius-type solution of the form

                                                                             

                                                   =  +.

                                                                            =0

    We plug this  into equation (7.3). We collect terms and write everything as a single
    series.

(ii) The obtained series must be zero. Setting the first coefficient (usually the coefficient of
     ) in the series to zero we obtain the indicial equation, which is a quadratic polynomial
     in .

(iii) If the indicial equation has two real roots 1 and 2 such that 1 - 2 is not an integer,
      then we have two linearly independent Frobenius-type solutions. Using the first root,

     we plug in

                                 

                 1 = 1   ,

                                =0

     and we solve for all  to obtain the first solution. Then using the second root, we

     plug in

                                 

                 2 = 2   ,

                                =0

     and solve for all  to obtain the second solution.

(iv) If the indicial equation has a doubled root , then there we find one solution

                                

                 1 =    ,

                              =0

     and then we obtain a new solution by plugging

                                                                          

                                           2 =    + (ln )1,

                                                                         =0

     into equation (7.3) and solving for the constants .

(v) If the indicial equation has two real roots such that 1 - 2 is an integer, then one
     solution is 
                                                 1 = 1   ,

                                                                                  =0
7.3. SINGULAR POINTS AND THE METHOD OF FROBENIUS                                           347

       and the second linearly independent solution is of the form

                                                                            

                                            2 = 2   + (ln )1,

                                                                           =0

       where we plug 2 into (7.3) and solve for the constants  and .

 (vi) Finally, if the indicial equation has complex roots, then solving for  in the solution

                                                                                      

                                                     = 1  

                                                                                     =0

       results in a complex-valued function--the  are complex numbers. We obtain our
       two linearly independent solutions by taking the real and imaginary parts of .

    The main idea is to find at least one Frobenius-type solution. If we are lucky and find
two, we are done. If we only get one, we either use the ideas above or even a different
method such as reduction of order (see § 2.1) to obtain a second solution.

7.3.3 Bessel functions

An important class of functions that arise commonly in physics are the Bessel functions.

For example, these functions appear when solving the wave equation in two and three
dimensions. First consider Bessel's equation of order :

                                 2  +   + 2 - 2  = 0.

We allow  to be any number, not just an integer, although integers and multiples of 1/2 are

most important in applications.

When we plug                             

                                  =  +

                                                                            =0

into Bessel's equation of order , we obtain the indicial equation

              ( - 1) +  - 2 = ( - )( + ) = 0.

We obtain two roots, 1 =  and 2 = -. If  is not an integer, then following the method
of Frobenius and setting 0 = 1, we find linearly independent solutions of the form

                                 (-1) 2 ,

              1 = 
              =0 22 !( + )( - 1 + ) · · · (2 + )(1 + )

                                 (-1) 2 .

              2 = -
              =0 22 !( - )( - 1 - ) · · · (2 - )(1 - )

See Joseph L. Neuringer, The Frobenius method for complex roots of the indicial equation, International Journal

of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology, Volume 9, Issue 1, 1978, 71-77.

Named after the German astronomer and mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (1784-1846).
348                                         CHAPTER 7. POWER-SERIES METHODS

Exercise 7.3.1:

a) Verify that the indicial equation of Bessel's equation of order  is ( - )( + ) = 0.

b) Suppose  is not an integer. Carry out the computation to obtain the solutions 1 and 2
   above.

Bessel functions are convenient constant multiples of 1 and 2. First we must define

the gamma function                   

                    () =                    -1- .

                                         0

Notice that (1) = 1. The gamma function also has a wonderful property

                    ( + 1) = ().

From this property, it follows that () = ( - 1)! when  is an integer. So the gamma
function is a continuous version of the factorial. We compute:

                 ( +  + 1) = ( + )( - 1 + ) · · · (2 + )(1 + )(1 + ),
                 ( -  + 1) = ( - )( - 1 - ) · · · (2 - )(1 - )(1 - ).

Exercise 7.3.2: Verify the identities above using ( + 1) = ().

We define the Bessel functions of the first kind of order  and - as

                    () = 2 1 (1 + ) 1 =    (-1)                 2+
                    -() = 2- 1 (1 - ) 2  =0 ! ( +  + 1) 2
                                                                     ,
                                             (-1)                2-
                                         = ! ( -  + 1)
                                                                        .
                                             =0                 2

As these are constant multiples of the solutions we found above, these are both solutions
to Bessel's equation of order . The constants are picked for convenience.

    When  is not an integer,  and - are linearly independent. When  is an integer we

obtain                                      (-1)   2+
                                                          .
                    () =
                    =0 ! ( + )! 2

In this case        () = (-1) -(),

and so - is not a second linearly independent solution. The other solution is the so-called
Bessel function of second kind. These make sense only for integer orders  and are defined as
limits of linear combinations of () and -(), as  approaches  in the following way:

                    () = lim cos()() - -() .
                                            sin()
7.3. SINGULAR POINTS AND THE METHOD OF FROBENIUS                                                    349

Each linear combination of () and -() is a solution to Bessel's equation of order .
Then as we take the limit as  goes to , we see that () is a solution to Bessel's equation
of order . It also turns out that () and () are linearly independent. Therefore when
 is an integer, we have the general solution to Bessel's equation of order :

                                              = () + (),

for arbitrary constants  and . Note that () goes to negative infinity at  = 0. Many
mathematical software packages have these functions () and () defined, so they
can be used just like say sin() and cos(). In fact, Bessel functions have some similar
properties. For example, -1() is a derivative of 0(), and in general the derivative of ()
can be written as a linear combination of -1() and +1(). Furthermore, these functions
oscillate, although they are not periodic. See Figure 7.4 for graphs of Bessel functions.

can be changed to 2 +   + 22 = 0. Changing variables  = , we obtain, via the
chain rule, the equation in  and :

                                              2 +   + 2  = 0,

which we recognize as Bessel's equation of order 0. Therefore the general solution is
() = 0() + 0(), or in terms of :

                                             = 0() + 0().

This equation comes up, for example, when finding the fundamental modes of vibration of
a circular drum, but we digress.

8.1 Linearization, critical points, and equilibria

Note: 1 lecture, §6.1-§6.2 in [EP], §9.2-§9.3 in [BD]

Except for a few brief detours in chapter 1, we considered mostly linear equations.

Linear equations suffice in many applications, but in reality most phenomena require

nonlinear equations. Nonlinear equations, however, are notoriously more difficult to

understand than linear ones, and many strange new phenomena appear when we allow

our equations to be nonlinear. Not to worry, we did not waste all this time studying

linear equations. Nonlinear equations can often be approximated by linear ones if we only

need a solution "locally"--only for a short period of time or only for certain parameters.

Understanding linear equations can also give us qualitative understanding about a more

general nonlinear problem. The idea is similar to what you did in calculus in trying to

approximate a function by a line with the right slope.                     
    In § 2.4 we looked at the pendulum of length . The goal was to    

solve for the angle () as a function of the time . The equation for         
the setup is the nonlinear equation

                                  +  sin   = 0.

Instead of solving this equation, we solved the rather easier linear

equation   +   = 0.

While the solution to the linear equation is not exactly what we were looking for, it is rather
close to the original, as long as the angle  is small and the time period involved is short.

    You might ask: Why don't we just solve the nonlinear problem? Well, it might be very
difficult, impractical, or impossible to solve analytically, depending on the equation in
question. We may not even be interested in the actual solution, we might only be interested
in some qualitative idea of what the solution is doing. For example, what happens as time
goes to infinity?
352  CHAPTER 8. NONLINEAR SYSTEMS

8.1.1 Autonomous systems and phase plane analysis

We restrict our attention to a two-dimensional autonomous system

                                         =  (, ),  = (, ),

where  (, ) and (, ) are functions of two variables, and the derivatives are taken with
respect to time . Solutions are functions () and () such that

                             () =  (), () , () =  (), () .

The way we will analyze the system is very similar to § 1.6, where we studied a single
autonomous equation. The ideas in two dimensions are the same, but the behavior can be
far more complicated.

    It may be best to think of the system of equations as the single vector equation
                                                    (, )
                                                  = (, ) . (8.1)

As in § 3.1, we draw the phase portrait (or phase diagram), where each point (, ) corresponds
to a specific state of the system. We draw the vector field given at each point (, ) by the

                (,)

vector (,) . And as before if we find solutions, we draw the trajectories by plotting all
points (), () for a certain range of .
Example 8.1.1: Consider the second-order equation  = - + 2. Write this equation as a
first-order nonlinear system

                                            = ,  = - + 2.

The phase portrait with some trajectories is drawn in Figure 8.1 on the next page.
    From the phase portrait it should be clear that even this simple system has fairly

complicated behavior. Some trajectories keep oscillating around the origin, and some go
off towards infinity. We will return to this example often, and analyze it completely in this
(and the next) section.

                                                                                                    (,)

    If we zoom into the diagram near a point where (,) is not zero, then nearby the
arrows point generally in essentially that same direction and have essentially the same
magnitude. In other words the behavior is not that interesting near such a point. We are of
course assuming that  (, ) and (, ) are continuous.

    Let us concentrate on those points in the phase diagram above where the trajectories
seem to start, end, or go around. We see two such points: (0, 0) and (1, 0). The trajectories
seem to go around the point (0, 0), and they seem to either go in or out of the point (1, 0).
These points are precisely those points where the derivatives of both  and  are zero. Let
us define the critical points as the points (, ) such that

                                                     (, ) ì
                                                               = 0.

                                                    (, )

In other words, these are the points where both  (, ) = 0 and (, ) = 0.

    The critical points are where the behavior of the system is in some sense the most

                                (,)

complicated. If (,) is zero, then nearby, the vector can point in any direction whatsoever.
Also, the trajectories are either going towards, away from, or around these points, so if we
are looking for long-term qualitative behavior of the system, we should look at what is
happening near the critical points.

    Critical points are also sometimes called equilibria, since we have so-called equilibrium
solutions at critical points. If (0, 0) is a critical point, then we have the solutions

                                             () = 0, () = 0.

In Example 8.1.1 on the facing page, there are two equilibrium solutions:

                        () = 0, () = 0, and () = 1, () = 0.

Compare this discussion on equilibria to the discussion in § 1.6. The underlying concept is
exactly the same.

8.1.2 Linearization

In § 3.5 we studied the behavior of a homogeneous linear system of two equations near a
critical point. For a linear system of two variables given by an invertible matrix, the only
critical point is the origin (0, 0). Let us put the understanding we gained in that section to
good use understanding what happens near critical points of nonlinear systems.

    In calculus we learned to estimate a function by taking its derivative and linearizing.
We work similarly with nonlinear systems of ODEs. Suppose (0, 0) is a critical point.
First change variables to (, ), so that (, ) = (0, 0) corresponds to (0, 0). That is,

                                          =  - 0,  =  - 0.
354                                              CHAPTER 8. NONLINEAR SYSTEMS

Next we need to find the derivative. In multivariable calculus you may have seen that the

several variables version of the derivative is the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix of the
vector-valued function (,)  (,) at (0, 0) is

          (0, 0)                                (0, 0)  .
         (0, 0)                              
                                              (0, 0)

This matrix gives the best linear approximation as  and  (and therefore  and ) vary.
We define the linearization of the equation (8.1) as the linear system

          (0, 0)    (0, 0)                                 .
      =                                      
                                      (0, 0)  (0, 0)

Example 8.1.2: Let us keep with the same equations as Example 8.1.1:  = ,  = - + 2.
There are two critical points, (0, 0) and (1, 0). The Jacobian matrix at any point is

        (, )    (, )                         =   01           .
      (, )                            (, )                 0
                                                 -1 + 2

At (0, 0), that is, when  = 0 and  = 0, the Jacobian matrix is

                                                       0 1,
                                                      -1 0
and our new variables are  =  and  = . The linearization at (0, 0) is
                                                0 1 
                                                = -1 0  .

At the point (1, 0), the Jacobian matrix is  01  , and our new variables are  =  - 1 and
                                             10
 = . The linearization at (1, 0) is

                                      0 1 
                                      =10 .

    The phase diagrams of the two linearizations at the critical points (0, 0) and (1, 0) are
given in Figure 8.2 on the next page. Note that the variables are now  and , which are
different at each critical point. Compare Figure 8.2 with Figure 8.1 on the preceding page,
and look especially at the behavior near the critical points.

8.2 Stability and classification of isolated critical points

Note: 1.5-2 lectures, §6.1-§6.2 in [EP], §9.2-§9.3 in [BD]

8.2.1 Isolated critical points and almost linear systems

A critical point is isolated if it is the only critical point in some small "neighborhood" of the

point. That is, if we zoom in far enough it is the only critical point we see. In the example

above, the critical point was isolated. If on the other hand there would be a whole curve of

critical points, then it would not be isolated.
    A system is called almost linear at a critical point (0, 0), if the critical point is isolated

and the Jacobian matrix at the point is invertible, or equivalently if the linearized system

has an isolated critical point. In such a case, the nonlinear terms are very small and the

system behaves like its linearization, at least if we are close to the critical point.

For example, the system in Examples 8.1.1 and 8.1.2 has two isolated critical points

(0, 0) and (1, 0), and is almost linear at both critical points as the Jacobian matrices at both

points,   01   and  01  , are invertible.
         -1 0       10
On the other hand, the system  = 2,  = 2 has an isolated critical point at (0, 0),

however the Jacobian matrix

                                           2 0
                                           0 2

is zero when (, ) = (0, 0). So the system is not almost linear. Even a worse example is the
system  = ,  = 2, which does not have isolated critical points;  and  are both zero
whenever  = 0, that is, the entire -axis.

    Fortunately, most often critical points are isolated, and the system is almost linear at

the critical points. So if we learn what happens there, we will have figured out the majority

of situations that arise in applications.

8.2.2 Stability and classification of isolated critical points

Once we have an isolated critical point, the system is almost linear at that critical point,
and we computed the associated linearized system, we can classify what happens to the
solutions. We more or less use the classification for linear two-variable systems from § 3.5,
with one minor caveat. Let us list the behaviors depending on the eigenvalues of the
Jacobian matrix at the critical point in Table 8.1 on the next page. This table is very similar
to Table 3.1 on page 150, with the exception of missing "center" points. We will discuss
centers later, as they are more complicated.

    In the third column, we mark points as asymptotically stable or unstable. Formally, a
stable critical point (0, 0) is one where given any small distance  to (0, 0), and any initial
condition within a perhaps smaller radius around (0, 0), the trajectory of the system
never goes further away from (0, 0) than . An unstable critical point is one that is not

stable. Informally, a point is stable if we start close to a critical point and follow a trajectory
we either go towards, or at least not away from, this critical point.

    A stable critical point (0, 0) is called asymptotically stable if given any initial condition
sufficiently close to (0, 0) and any solution (), () satisfying that condition, then

                                           lim (), () = (0, 0).

                                                          

That is, the critical point is asymptotically stable if any trajectory for a sufficiently close
initial condition goes towards the critical point (0, 0).

Example 8.2.1: Consider  = - - 2,  = - + 2. See Figure 8.3 on the next page for
the phase diagram. Let us find the critical points. These are the points where - - 2 = 0
and - + 2 = 0. The first equation means  = -2, and so 2 = 4. Plugging into the
second equation we obtain - + 4 = 0. Factoring, we obtain (3 - 1) = 0. Since we are
looking only for real solutions we get either  = 0 or  = 1. Solving for the corresponding
 using  = -2, we get two critical points, one being (0, 0) and the other being (1, -1).

Clearly the critical points are isolated.

    Let us compute the Jacobian matrix:

                                        -2 -1 .
                                        -1 2

At the point (0, 0) we get the matrix   0 -1  and so the two eigenvalues are 1 and -1. As
                                       -1 0
the matrix is invertible, the system is almost linear at (0, 0). As the eigenvalues are real and

of opposite signs, we get a saddle point, which is an unstable equilibrium point.

At the point (1, -1) we get the matrix  -2 -1  and computing the eigenvalues we get -1,
                                        -1 -2
-3. The matrix is invertible, and so the system is almost linear at (1, -1). As we have real

eigenvalues and both negative, the critical point is a sink, and therefore an asymptotically
stable equilibrium point. That is, if we start with any point ( , ) close to (1, -1) as an
initial condition and plot a trajectory, it approaches (1, -1). In other words,

     lim (), () = (1, -1).

Figure 8.3: The phase portrait with few sample trajectories of  = - - 2,  = - + 2.

As you can see from the diagram, this behavior is true even for some initial points quite far
from (1, -1), but it is definitely not true for all initial points.

Example 8.2.2: Let us look at  =  + 2,  = . First let us find the critical points.
These are the points where  + 2 = 0 and  = 0. Simplifying we get 0 =  + 2 = ( + 1).
So the critical points are (0, 0) and (0, -1), and hence are isolated. Let us compute the

Jacobian matrix:                2 1 + 2 .

                                1              0

At the point (0, 0) we get the matrix   01     and so the two eigenvalues are 1 and -1. As
                                        10
the matrix is invertible, the system is almost linear at (0, 0). And, as the eigenvalues are

real and of opposite signs, we get a saddle point, which is an unstable equilibrium point.

At the point (0, -1) we get the matrix  1 -1   whose  eigenvalues  are  1  ±    23 .  The  matrix
                                        10                              2
is invertible, and so the system is almost linear at (0, -1). As we have complex eigenvalues

with positive real part, the critical point is a spiral source, and therefore an unstable

equilibrium point.

See Figure 8.4 on the following page for the phase diagram. Notice the two critical

points, and the behavior of the arrows in the vector field around these points.

8.2.3 The trouble with centers

Recall, a linear system with a center means that trajectories travel in closed elliptical orbits
in some direction around the critical point. Such a critical point we call a center or a stable
center. It is not an asymptotically stable critical point, as the trajectories never approach the
critical point, but at least if you start sufficiently close to the critical point, you stay close to
the critical point. The simplest example of such behavior is the linear system with a center.
Another example is the critical point (0, 0) in Example 8.1.1 on page 352.
360                                                     CHAPTER 8. NONLINEAR SYSTEMS

         Figure 8.4: The phase portrait with few sample trajectories of  =  + 2,  = .

    The trouble with a center in a nonlinear system is that whether the trajectory goes
towards or away from the critical point is governed by the sign of the real part of the
eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix, and the Jacobian matrix in a nonlinear system changes
from point to point. Since this real part is zero at the critical point itself, it can have either
sign nearby, meaning the trajectory could be pulled towards or away from the critical point.

Example 8.2.3: An example of such a problematic behavior is the system  = ,  = -+3.
The only critical point is the origin (0, 0). The Jacobian matrix is

                                           -1 32 0 1 .

At (0, 0) the Jacobian matrix is   01   , which has eigenvalues ±. So the linearization has a
                                  -1 0

center.

Via the quadratic equation, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at any point (, ) are

                                   = 3 2 ±  4 - 94 .
                                        2     2

At any point where   0 (so at most points near the origin), the eigenvalues have a positive
real part (2 can never be negative). This positive real part pulls the trajectory away from

the origin. A sample trajectory for an initial condition near the origin is given in Figure 8.5

on the facing page.

    The moral of the example is that further analysis is needed when the linearization has a
center. The analysis will in general be more complicated than in the example above and
is more likely to involve case-by-case consideration. Such a complication should not be
surprising to you. By now in your mathematical career, you have seen many places where
a simple test is inconclusive, and more careful, perhaps ad hoc, analysis is required. Recall
for example when the second derivative test for maxima or minima is inconclusive.

8.2.4 Conservative equations

An equation of the form

                                     +  () = 0,

where  () is an arbitrary function, is called a conservative equation. For example, the
pendulum equation is a conservative equation. The equations are conservative as there
is no friction in the system so the energy in the system is "conserved." Let us write this
equation as a system of nonlinear ODEs.

                                     = ,  = -  ().

These types of equations have the advantage that we can solve for their trajectories easily.
    The trick is to first think of  as a function of  for a moment. Then use the chain rule

                                     =  =   =   ,
                                                 

where the prime indicates a derivative with respect to . We obtain    +  () = 0. We
                                        
integrate with respect to  to get    +  ()  = . In other words

                                           
                                    1 2 +  ()  = .
                                    2

We obtained an implicit equation for the trajectories, with different  giving different
trajectories. The value of  is conserved on any trajectory. This expression is sometimes

called the Hamiltonian or the energy of the system. If you look back to § 1.8, you will notice
that    +  () = 0 is an exact equation, and we just found a potential function.
362                                CHAPTER 8. NONLINEAR SYSTEMS

Example 8.2.4: Let us find the trajectories for the equation  +  - 2 = 0, which is the
equation from Example 8.1.1 on page 352. The corresponding first-order system is

                                           = ,  = - + 2.

Trajectories satisfy               1 2 + 12 - 13 = .
We solve for                       223

                       = ± -2 + 2 3 + 2.
                                         3

    Plotting these graphs we get exactly the trajectories in Figure 8.1 on page 353. In
particular we notice that near the origin the trajectories are closed curves: they keep going
around the origin, never spiraling in or out. Therefore we discovered a way to verify that
the critical point at (0, 0) is a stable center. The critical point at (1, 0) is a saddle as we
already noticed. This example is typical for conservative equations.

    Consider an arbitrary conservative equation  +  () = 0. All critical points occur
when  = 0 (the -axis), that is, when  = 0. The critical points are those points on the
-axis where  () = 0. The trajectories are given by

                                   
                       = ± -2  ()  + 2.

So all trajectories are mirrored across the -axis. In particular, there can be no spiral sources

nor sinks. The Jacobian matrix is

                                   -  0 1 () 0 .

The critical point is almost linear if  ()  0 at the critical point. Let  denote the Jacobian
matrix. The eigenvalues of  are solutions to

                      0 = det( - ) = 2 +  ().

Therefore  = ± -  (). In other words, either we get real eigenvalues of opposite signs
(if  () < 0), or we get purely imaginary eigenvalues (if  () > 0). There are only two

possibilities for critical points, either an unstable saddle point, or a stable center. There are

never any sinks or sources.

8.3 Applications of nonlinear systems

Note: 2 lectures, §6.3-§6.4 in [EP], §9.3, §9.5 in [BD]

    In this section we study two very standard examples of nonlinear systems. First, we
look at the nonlinear pendulum equation. We saw the pendulum equation's linearization
before, but we noted it was only valid for small angles and short times. Now we find
out what happens for large angles. Next, we look at the predator-prey equation, which
finds various applications in modeling problems in biology, chemistry, economics, and
elsewhere.

8.3.1 Pendulum

The  first  example  we  study  is  the  pendulum  equation   +    sin    =  0.  Here,    is  the  angular
                                                                 

displacement,  is the gravitational acceleration, and  is the length of the pendulum. In

this equation we disregard friction, so we are talking about an idealized pendulum.

This equation is a conservative equation, so we can use our

analysis of conservative equations from the previous section. Let us                                    
change the equation to a two-dimensional system in variables (, )                                  

by introducing the new variable :

                                         

                                      =            .                                               

                                         -  sin 

                                                                                                          

The critical points of this system are when  = 0 and -  sin  = 0, or in other words
if sin  = 0. So the critical points are when  = 0 and  is a multiple of . That is,
the points are . . . (-2, 0), (-, 0), (0, 0), (, 0), (2, 0) . . .. While there are infinitely many

critical points, they are all isolated. Let us compute the Jacobian matrix:

                                                       =  0 1 .
                                                            - cos  0
                                         
                                          -  sin                 
                           -  sin                     
                         

    For conservative equations, there are two types of critical points. Either stable centers,

                                                                                                                               

or saddle points. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are  = ± -  cos .

    The eigenvalues are going to be real when cos  < 0. This happens at the odd
multiples of . The eigenvalues are going to be purely imaginary when cos  > 0.
This happens at the even multiples of . Therefore the system has a stable center
at the points . . . (-2, 0), (0, 0), (2, 0) . . ., and it has an unstable saddle at the points

angles. The horizontal axis is the deflection angle. The vertical axis is the angular velocity

of the pendulum. Suppose we start at  = 0 (no deflection), and we start with a small
angular velocity . Then the trajectory keeps going around the critical point (0, 0) in an

approximate circle. This corresponds to short swings of the pendulum back and forth.
When  stays small, the trajectories really look like circles and hence are very close to our

linearization.

When we give the pendulum a big enough push, it goes across the top and keeps

spinning about its axis. This behavior corresponds to the wavy curves that do not cross the

horizontal axis in the phase diagram. Let us suppose we look at the top curves, when the
angular velocity  is large and positive. Then the pendulum is going around and around

its axis. The velocity is going to be large when the pendulum is near the bottom, and the

velocity is the smallest when the pendulum is close to the top of its loop.
    At each critical point, there is an equilibrium solution. Consider the solution  = 0;

the pendulum is not moving and is hanging straight down. This is a stable place for the

pendulum to be, hence this is a stable equilibrium.
    The other type of equilibrium solution is at the unstable point, for example  = . Here

the pendulum is upside down. Sure you can balance the pendulum this way and it will

stay, but this is an unstable equilibrium. Even the tiniest push will make the pendulum

start swinging wildly.

    See Figure 8.7 on the following page for a diagram. The first picture is the stable
equilibrium  = 0. The second corresponds to those "almost circles" in the phase diagram
around  = 0 when the angular velocity is small. The third is the unstable equilibrium
 = . The last picture corresponds to the wavy lines for large angular velocities.

The quantity                      12 2 -  cos  

is conserved by any solution. This is the energy or the Hamiltonian of the system.

We have a conservative equation and so (exercise) the trajectories are given by

                                              = ± 2 cos   + ,

for various values of . Let us look at the initial condition of (0, 0), that is, we take the
pendulum to angle 0, and just let it go (initial angular velocity 0). We plug the initial
conditions into the above and solve for  to obtain

                                                 = - 2 cos  0.

Thus the expression for the trajectory is

                                        = ± 2 cos   - cos 0.

Let us figure out the period. That is, the time it takes for the pendulum to swing back

and forth. We notice that the trajectory about the origin in the phase plane is symmetric

about both the  and the -axis. That is, in terms of , the time it takes from 0 to -0 is

the same as it takes from -0 back to 0. Furthermore, the time it takes from -0 to 0 is the

same as to go from 0 to 0. Therefore, let us find how long it takes for the pendulum to go

from angle 0 to angle 0, which is a quarter of the full oscillation and then multiply by 4.
                                                
We      figure  out  this  time  by  finding      and   integrating  from  0  to  0.    The  period  is  four

times  this  integral.  Let  us  stay  in  the  region  where    is  positive.  Since     =      inverting

                                                                                              ,

we get

                                                 1 .
                                        =       2 cos  - cos 0

Therefore the period  is given by

                                 =4          0  1 .

The integral is an improper integral, and we cannot in general evaluate it symbolically. We

must resort to numerical approximation if we want to compute a particular .

constant, it does not change with the initial angle 0. The actual period  gets larger and

larger as 0 gets larger. Notice how the relative error is small when 0 is small. It is still

only 15% when 0 = /2, that is, a 90 degree angle. The error is 3.8% when starting at /4, a

45 degree angle. At a 5 degree initial angle, the error is only 0.048%.

That is, the period goes to infinity as the initial angle approaches the unstable equilibrium
point. So if we put the pendulum almost upside down it may take a very long time before
it gets down. This is consistent with the limiting behavior, where the exactly upside down
pendulum never makes an oscillation, so we could think of that as infinite period.

8.3.2 Predator-prey or Lotka-Volterra systems

One of the most common simple applications of nonlinear systems are the so-called
predator-prey or Lotka-Volterra systems. For example, these systems arise when two species

interact, one as the prey and one as the predator. It is then no surprise that the equations

also see applications in economics. The system also arises in chemical reactions. In biology,

this system of equations explains the natural periodic variations of populations of different

species in nature. Before the application of differential equations, these periodic variations

in the population baffled biologists.

We keep with the classical example of hares and foxes in a forest, it is the easiest to

understand.   = # of hares (the prey),

              = # of foxes (the predator).

When there are a lot of hares, there is plenty of food for the foxes, so the fox population
grows. However, when the fox population grows, the foxes eat more hares, so when there
are lots of foxes, the hare population should go down, and vice versa. The Lotka-Volterra
model proposes that this behavior is described by the system of equations

                                        = ( - ),
                                        = ( - ),

where , , ,  are some parameters that describe the interaction of the foxes and hares.
In this model, these are all positive numbers.

    Let us analyze the idea behind this model. The model is a slightly more complicated
idea based on the exponential population model. First expand,

                                           = ( - ) =  - .

The hares are expected to simply grow exponentially in the absence of foxes. That is where
the  term comes in, the growth in population is proportional to the population itself.
We are assuming the hares always find enough food and have enough space to reproduce.
However, there is another component -, that is, the population also is decreasing
proportionally to the number of foxes. Together we can write the equation as ( - ), so
it is like exponential growth or decay but the constant depends on the number of foxes.

    The equation for foxes is very similar, expand again

                                           = ( - ) =  - .

The foxes need food (hares) to reproduce: the more food, the bigger the rate of growth,
hence the  term. On the other hand, there are natural deaths in the fox population, and
hence the - term.

     Named for the American mathematician, chemist, and statistician Alfred James Lotka (1880-1949) and
the Italian mathematician and physicist Vito Volterra (1860-1940).

     This interaction does not end well for the hare.

    Without further delay, let us start with an explicit example. Suppose the equations are

                              = (0.4 - 0.01),  = (0.003 - 0.3).

See Figure 8.9 for the phase portrait. In this example it makes sense to also plot  and  as
graphs with respect to time. Therefore the second graph in Figure 8.9 is the graph of  and
 on the vertical axis (the prey  is the thinner line with taller peaks), against time on the
horizontal axis. The particular solution graphed was with initial conditions of 20 foxes and
50 hares.

    Let us analyze what we see on the graphs. We work in the general setting rather than
putting in specific numbers. We start with finding the critical points. Set ( - ) = 0,
and ( - ) = 0. The first equation is satisfied if either  = 0 or  = /. If  = 0, the
second equation implies  = 0. If  = /, the second equation implies  = /. There are
two equilibria: at (0, 0) when there are no animals at all, and at (/, /). In our specific
example  = / = 100, and  = / = 40. This is the point where there are 100 hares and 40

foxes.

    We compute the Jacobian matrix:

                                                  -  - .
                                                     - 

At the origin (0, 0) we get the matrix  0    , so the eigenvalues are  and -, hence real
                                        0 -

and of opposite signs. So the critical point at the origin is a saddle. This makes sense. If

you started with some foxes but no hares, then the foxes would go extinct, that is, you

would approach the origin. If you started with no foxes and a few hares, then the hares

would keep multiplying without check, and so you would go away from the origin.
    OK, how about the other critical point at (/, /). Here the Jacobian matrix becomes

                                        0 -
                                          .
                                        0
370                       CHAPTER 8. NONLINEAR SYSTEMS

                                                                                
The eigenvalues satisfy 2 +  = 0. In other words,  = ± . The eigenvalues being

purely imaginary, we are in the case where we cannot quite decide using only linearization.

We could have a stable center, spiral sink, or a spiral source. That is, the equilibrium could

be asymptotically stable, stable, or unstable. Of course I gave you a picture above that

seems to imply it is a stable center. But never trust a picture only. Perhaps the oscillations

are getting larger and larger, but only very slowly. Of course this would be bad as it would

imply something will go wrong with our population sooner or later. And I only graphed a

very specific example with very specific trajectories.

How can we be sure we are in the stable situation? As we said before, in the case of

purely imaginary eigenvalues, we have to do a bit more work. Previously we found that for

conservative systems, there was a certain quantity that was conserved on the trajectories,

and hence the trajectories had to go in closed loops. We can use a similar technique here.

We just have to figure out what is the conserved quantity. After some trial and error we

find the constant     

                   =   +  =   --

is conserved. Such a quantity is called the constant of motion. Let us check  really is a
constant of motion. How do we check, you say? Well, a constant is something that does
not change with time, so let us compute the derivative with respect to time:

      =  -1  -- +  -1-- +   --(- -  ).

Our equations give us what  and  are so let us plug those in:

              =  -1( - ) -- +  -1( -  )--
                      +  -- -( - ) - ( - )

                 =  -- ( - ) + ( - ) + -( - ) - ( - )
                 = 0.

                                                                                                                      

So along the trajectories  is constant. In fact, the expression  = + gives us an implicit
equation for the trajectories. In any case, once we have found this constant of motion, it

                                                                                                                                  

must be true that the trajectories are simple curves--the level curves of + . It turns out,
the critical point at (/, /) is a maximum for  (left as an exercise). So (/, /) is a stable
equilibrium point, and we do not have to worry about the foxes and hares going extinct or
their populations exploding.

    One blemish on this wonderful model is that the number of foxes and hares are discrete
quantities and we are modeling with continuous variables. Our model has no problem
with there being 0.1 fox in the forest for example, while in reality that makes no sense. The
approximation is a reasonable one as long as the number of foxes and hares are large, but
it does not make much sense for small numbers. One must be careful in interpreting any
results from such a model.
8.3. APPLICATIONS OF NONLINEAR SYSTEMS                                                 371

    An interesting consequence (perhaps counterintuitive) of this model is that adding
animals to the forest might lead to extinction, because the variations will get too big, and
one of the populations will get close to zero. For example, suppose there are 20 foxes and
50 hares as before, but now we bring in more foxes, bringing their number to 200. If we
run the computation, we find the number of hares will plummet to just slightly more than
1 hare in the whole forest. In reality that most likely means the hares die out, and then the
foxes will die out as well as they will have nothing to eat.

    Showing that a system of equations has a stable solution can be a very difficult problem.
When Isaac Newton put forth his laws of planetary motions, he proved that a single
planet orbiting a single sun is a stable system. But any solar system with more than 1
planet proved very difficult indeed. In fact, such a system behaves chaotically (see § 8.5),
meaning small changes in initial conditions lead to very different long-term outcomes.
From numerical experimentation and measurements, we know the earth will not fly out
into the empty space or crash into the sun, for at least some millions of years or so. But we
do not know what happens beyond that.

8.4 Limit cycles

Note: less than 1 lecture, discussed in §6.1 and §6.4 in [EP] , §9.7 in [BD]

    For nonlinear systems, trajectories do not simply need to approach or leave a single
point. They may in fact approach a larger set, such as a circle or another closed curve.
Example 8.4.1: The Van der Pol oscillator is the following equation

                                            - (1 - 2) +  = 0,

where  is some positive constant. The Van der Pol oscillator originated with electrical
circuits, but finds applications in diverse fields such as biology, seismology, and other
physical sciences.

    For simplicity, let us use  = 1. A phase diagram is given in the left-hand plot in
Figure 8.10. Notice how the trajectories seem to very quickly settle on a closed curve. On
the right-hand side is the plot of a single solution for  = 0 to  = 30 with initial conditions
(0) = 0.1 and (0) = 0.1. The solution quickly tends to a periodic solution.

    Figure 8.10: The phase portrait (left) and a graph of a sample solution of the Van der Pol oscillator.

    The Van der Pol oscillator is an example of so-called relaxation oscillation. The word
relaxation comes from the sudden jump (the very steep part of the solution). For larger 
the steep part becomes even more pronounced, for small  the limit cycle looks more like a
circle. In fact, setting  = 0, we get  +  = 0, which is a linear system with a center and
all trajectories become circles.

    A trajectory in the phase portrait that is a closed curve (a curve that is a loop) is called a
closed trajectory. A limit cycle is a closed trajectory such that at least one other trajectory
spirals into it (or spirals out of it). For example, the closed curve in the phase portrait for

     Named for the Dutch physicist Balthasar van der Pol (1889-1959).
374                                   CHAPTER 8. NONLINEAR SYSTEMS

the Van der Pol equation is a limit cycle. If all trajectories that start near the limit cycle

spiral into it, the limit cycle is called asymptotically stable. The limit cycle in the Van der Pol

oscillator is asymptotically stable.

    Given a closed trajectory on an autonomous system, any solution that starts on it is

periodic. Such a curve is called a periodic orbit. More precisely, if (), () is a solution

such that for some 0 the point (0), (0) lies on a periodic orbit, then both () and ()
are periodic functions (with the same period). That is, there is some number  such that

() = ( + ) and () = ( + ).

Consider the system

                          =  (, ),  = (, ),                   (8.2)

where the functions  and  have continuous derivatives in some region  in the plane.

Theorem 8.4.1 (Poincaré-Bendixson). Suppose  is a closed bounded region (a region in the

plane that includes its boundary and does not have points arbitrarily far from the origin). Suppose
 (), () is a solution of (8.2) in  that exists for all   0. Then either the solution is a periodic
function, or the solution tends towards a periodic solution in .

    The main point of the theorem is that if you find one solution that exists for all  large
enough (that is, as  goes to infinity) and stays within a bounded region, then you have
found either a periodic orbit, or a solution that spirals towards a limit cycle or tends to a
critical point. That is, in the long term, the behavior is very close to a periodic function.
Note that a constant solution at a critical point is periodic (with any period). The theorem is
more a qualitative statement rather than something to help us in computations. In practice
it is hard to find analytic solutions and so hard to show rigorously that they exist for all time.
But if we think the solution exists we numerically solve for a large time to approximate the
limit cycle. Another caveat is that the theorem only works in two dimensions. In three
dimensions and higher, there is simply too much room.

    The theorem applies to all solutions in the Van der Pol oscillator. Solutions that start at
any point except the origin (0, 0) tend to the periodic solution around the limit cycle, and
the initial condition of (0, 0) gives the constant solution  = 0,  = 0.

Example 8.4.2: Consider

      =  + (2 + 2 - 1)2,  = - + (2 + 2 - 1)2.

A vector field along with solutions with initial conditions (1.02, 0), (0.9, 0), and (0.1, 0) are

drawn in Figure 8.11 on the facing page.
    Notice that points on the unit circle (distance one from the origin) satisfy 2 + 2 - 1 = 0.

And () = sin(),  = cos() is a solution of the system. Therefore we have a closed
trajectory. For points off the unit circle, the second term in  pushes the solution further
away from the -axis than the system  = ,  = -, and  pushes the solution further
away from the -axis than the linear system  = ,  = -. In other words for all other

initial conditions the trajectory will spiral out.

Ivar Otto Bendixson (1861-1935) was a Swedish mathematician.

    This means that for initial conditions inside the unit circle, the solution spirals out
towards the periodic solution on the unit circle, and for initial conditions outside the unit
circle the solutions spiral off towards infinity. Therefore the unit circle is a limit cycle, but
not an asymptotically stable one. The Poincaré-Bendixson Theorem applies to the initial
points inside the unit circle, as those solutions stay bounded, but not to those outside, as
those solutions go off to infinity.

    A similar analysis applies to the system

                         =  + (2 + 2 - 1),  = - + (2 + 2 - 1).

The unit circle is again a closed trajectory, points outside the unit circle spiral out to infinity,
but now points inside the unit circle spiral towards the critical point at the origin. The
unit circle is an asymptotically unstable limit cycle where all trajectories spiral out. If we
consider the linear system  = ,  = -, then all circles centered at the origin (not just
the unit circle) are closed trajectories, but no trajectory spirals onto any other, so none of
the circles are limit cycles. By Poincaré-Bendixson, all these solutions are periodic.

    By Picard's theorem (Theorem 3.1.1 on page 124), at any point in the plane, we can
always find a solution to (8.2) a little bit forward or backwards in time, as long as  and 
have continuous derivatives. So if we find a closed trajectory in an autonomous system,
then for every initial point inside the closed trajectory, the solution will exist for all time
and it will stay bounded (it will stay inside the closed trajectory). The moment we found
the solution above going around the unit circle, we knew that for every initial point inside
the circle, the solution exists for all time and the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem applies.

    We next look for conditions when limit cycles (or periodic orbits) do not exist. We
assume the equation (8.2) is defined on a simply connected region, that is, a region with
no holes we can go around. For example, the entire plane is a simply connected region.
So is the inside of the unit disc. However, the entire plane minus a point is not a simply
connected region as it has a "hole" at the origin.
376                                              CHAPTER 8. NONLINEAR SYSTEMS

Theorem 8.4.2 (Bendixson-Dulac). Suppose  is a simply connected region, and the expression

                                                      + 
                                                      

is either always positive or always negative on  (except perhaps a small set such as on isolated
points or curves) then the system (8.2) has no closed trajectory inside .

    The theorem gives a way of ruling out the existence of a closed trajectory, and hence
a way of ruling out limit cycles. The expression    +   may seem random, but it is
called the divergence of the vector field. Divergence measures how much the vector field is

"expanding" at any point and comes up in many other contexts. The theorem says that if
the vector field is either expanding everywhere on  or contracting everywhere on , then

there is no closed trajectory and so no limit cycle. Perhaps this is intuitive--if particles

travel along the vector fields and are getting further and further apart, then we do not

expect any particles to travel in loops. The exception about points or curves means that

divergence can be zero at a few points, or on a curve, but not on any larger set.

Example 8.4.3: Consider  =  + 2,  =  in the entire plane (see Example 8.2.2

on page 359). The plane is simply connected and the theorem applies. We compute
     
  +    =  2  + 0.  The  function  2  is  always  positive  except  on  the  line    =  0.  Therefore,

via the theorem, the system has no closed trajectories.

    A common informal, but not quite correct, way to state the theorem is to conclude there
are no periodic solutions that stay in . The example above has two critical points and

hence it has constant solutions. Constant functions are periodic. The conclusion of the

theorem is that there exist no trajectories that form closed curves, or in other words, that
there exist no nonconstant periodic solutions that stay in .

Example 8.4.4: Consider a somewhat more complicated example. Take the system  =
- - 2,  = - + 2 (see Example 8.2.1 on page 358). We compute    +   = -2 + 2 =
2(- + ). This expression takes on both signs, so if we are talking about the whole plane we
cannot simply apply the theorem. However, we could apply it on the set where - +   0.

Via the theorem, there is no closed trajectory in that set. Similarly, there is no closed
trajectory in the set - +   0. We cannot conclude (yet) that there is no closed trajectory
in the entire plane. For all we know, perhaps half of it is in the set where - +   0 and
the other half is in the set where - +   0.

    The key is to look at the line where -+ = 0, or  = . On this line,  = --2 = --2
and  = - + 2 = - + 2. In particular, if  = , then   . So the arrows, the vectors
(, ), always point into the set where - +   0. There is no way we can start in the
set where - +   0 and go into the set where - +   0. Once we are in the set where
- +   0, we stay there. So no closed trajectory can have points in both sets.

     Henri Dulac (1870-1955) was a French mathematician.
     Usually the expression in the Bendixson-Dulac Theorem is  (  ) +  () for some continuously
differentiable function . For simplicity, let us just consider the case  = 1.
8.4. LIMIT CYCLES                                                               377

Example 8.4.5: Consider  =  + (2 + 2 - 1),  = - + (2 + 2 - 1) in the region 
given by 2 + 2 > 21 . That is,  is the region outside a circle of radius 12 centered at the
origin. Then there is a closed trajectory in , namely  = cos(),  = sin(). Furthermore,

                                            +  = 4  2 + 42 - 2,

which is always positive on . So what is going on? The Bendixson-Dulac theorem does
not apply since the region  is not simply connected--it has a hole, the circle we cut out!

8.5 Chaos

Note: 1 lecture, §6.5 in [EP], §9.8 in [BD]

    You have surely heard the story about the flap of a butterfly wing in the Amazon
causing hurricanes in the North Atlantic. In a prior section, we mentioned that a small
change in initial conditions of the planets can lead to very different configuration of the
planets in the long term. These are examples of chaotic systems. Mathematical chaos is
not really chaos, there is precise order behind the scenes. Everything is still deterministic.
However a chaotic system is extremely sensitive to initial conditions. This also means even
small errors induced via numerical approximation create large errors very quickly, so it is
almost impossible to numerically approximate for long times. This is a large part of the
trouble, as chaotic systems cannot be in general solved analytically.

    Take the weather, the most well-known chaotic system. A small change in the initial
conditions (the temperature at every point of the atmosphere for example) produces
drastically different predictions in relatively short time, and so we cannot accurately
predict weather. And we do not actually know the exact initial conditions. We measure
temperatures at a few points with some error, and then we somehow estimate what is
in between. There is no way we can accurately measure the effects of every butterfly
wing. Then we solve the equations numerically introducing new errors. You should not
trust weather prediction more than a few days out. But we will see we can still get some
information about a chaotic system on a longer time scale, in the context of weather, we
can study the climate.

    Chaotic behavior was first noticed by Edward Lorenz in the 1960s when trying to
model thermally induced air convection (movement). Lorentz was looking at the relatively
simple system:

      = -10 + 10,   = 28 -  - ,   = -8 + .
                                         3

A small change in the initial conditions yields a very different solution after a reasonably
short time.

    A simple example the reader can experiment with, and which displays
chaotic behavior, is a double pendulum. The equations for this setup are
somewhat complicated, and their derivation is quite tedious, so we will not
bother to write them down. The idea is to put a pendulum on the end of
another pendulum. The movement of the bottom mass will appear chaotic.
This type of chaotic system is a basis for a whole number of office novelty
desk toys. It is simple to build a version. Take a piece of a string. Tie two
heavy nuts at different points of the string; one at the end, and one a bit
above. Now give the bottom nut a little push. As long as the swings are not too big and
the string stays tight, you have a double pendulum system.

Edward Norton Lorenz (1917-2008) was an American mathematician and meteorologist.

8.5.1 Duffing equation and strange attractors

Let us study the so-called Duffing equation:

                            +  +  + 3 =  cos().

Here , , , , and  are constants. Except for the 3 term, this equation looks like a
forced mass-spring system. The 3 means the spring does not exactly obey Hooke's law
(which no real-world spring actually obeys exactly). When  is not zero, the equation

does not have a closed form solution, so we must resort to numerical solutions, as is usual

for nonlinear systems. Not all choices of constants and initial conditions exhibit chaotic

behavior. Let us study

                            + 0.05 + 3 = 8 cos().

    The equation is not autonomous, so we cannot draw the vector field in the phase plane.
We can still draw trajectories. In Figure 8.12, we plot trajectories for  going from 0 to 15 for
two very close initial conditions (2, 3) and (2, 2.9), and also the solutions in the (, ) space.

The two trajectories are close at first, but after a while diverge significantly. This sensitivity

to initial conditions is precisely what we mean by the system behaving chaotically.

initial conditions (2, 3) and the other with (2, 2.9). On right the two solutions in (, )-space.

    Let us see the long term behavior. In Figure 8.13 on the following page, we plot the
behavior of the system for initial conditions (2, 3) for a longer period of time. It is hard to
see any particular pattern in the shape of the solution except that it seems to oscillate, but
each oscillation appears quite unique. The oscillation is expected due to the forcing term.
We mention that to produce the picture accurately, a ridiculously large number of steps
had to be used in the numerical algorithm, as even small errors quickly propagate in a
chaotic system.

     In fact for reference, 30,000 steps were used with the Runge-Kutta algorithm, see exercises in § 1.7.

       Figure 8.13: The solution to the given Duffing equation for  from 0 to 100.

    It is very difficult to analyze chaotic systems, or to find the order behind the madness,
but let us try to do something that we did for the standard mass-spring system. One
way we analyzed the system is that we figured out what was the long term behavior (not
dependent on initial conditions). From the figure above, it is clear that we will not get a
nice exact description of the long term behavior for this chaotic system, but perhaps we
can find some order to what happens on each "oscillation" and what do these oscillations
have in common.

    The concept we explore is that of a Poincaré section. Instead of looking at  in a certain
interval, we look at where the system is at a certain sequence of points in time. Imagine
flashing a strobe at a fixed frequency and drawing the points where the solution is during
the flashes. The right strobing frequency depends on the system in question. The correct
frequency for the forced Duffing equation (and other similar systems) is the frequency of
the forcing term. For the Duffing equation above, find a solution (), () , and look at
the points

              (0), (0) , (2), (2) , (4), (4) , (6), (6) , . . .

As we are really not interested in the transient part of the solution, that is, the part of
the solution that depends on the initial condition, we skip some number of steps in the
beginning. For example, we might skip the first 100 such steps and start plotting points at
 = 100(2), that is,

               (200), (200) , (202), (202) , (204), (204) , . . .

The plot of these points is the Poincaré section. After plotting enough points, a curious
pattern emerges in Figure 8.14 on the next page (the left-hand picture), a so-called strange
attractor.

     Named for the French polymath Jules Henri Poincaré (1854-1912).

Figure 8.14: Strange attractor. The left plot is with no phase shift, the right plot has phase shift /4.

    Given a sequence of points, an attractor is a set towards which the points in the sequence
eventually get closer and closer to, that is, they are attracted. The Poincaré section is not
really the attractor itself, but as the points are very close to it, we see its shape. The strange
attractor is a very complicated set. It has fractal structure, that is, if you zoom in as far as
you want, you keep seeing the same complicated structure.

    The initial condition makes no difference. If we start with a different initial condition,
the points eventually gravitate towards the attractor, and so as long as we throw away
the first few points, we get the same picture. Similarly small errors in the numerical
approximations do not matter here.

    An amazing thing is that a chaotic system such as the Duffing equation is not random
at all. There is a very complicated order to it, and the strange attractor says something
about this order. We cannot quite say what state the system will be in eventually, but given
the fixed strobing frequency we narrow it down to the points on the attractor.

    If we use a phase shift, for example /4, and look at the times

                               /4, 2 + /4, 4 + /4, 6 + /4, . . .

we obtain a slightly different attractor. The picture is the right-hand side of Figure 8.14. It
is as if we had rotated, moved, and slightly distorted the original. For each phase shift you
can find the set of points towards which the system periodically keeps coming back to.

    Study the pictures and notice especially the scales--where are these attractors located
in the phase plane. Notice the regions where the strange attractor lives and compare it to
the plot of the trajectories in Figure 8.12 on page 379.

    Let us compare this section to the discussion in § 2.6 on forced oscillations. Consider

                                        + 2 + 02 = 0  cos().

This is like the Duffing equation, but with no 3 term. The steady periodic solution is of
382                                                                  CHAPTER 8. NONLINEAR SYSTEMS

the form

                              =  cos( + ).

Strobing using the frequency , we obtain a single point in the phase space. The attractor
in this setting is a single point--an expected result as the system is not chaotic. It was
the opposite of chaotic: Any difference induced by the initial conditions dies away very
quickly, and we settle into always the same steady periodic motion.

8.5.2 The Lorenz system

In two dimensions to find chaotic behavior, we must study forced, or non-autonomous,
systems such as the Duffing equation. The Poincaré-Bendixson Theorem says that a
solution to an autonomous two-dimensional system that exists for all time in the future
and does not go towards infinity is periodic or tends towards a periodic solution. Hardly
the chaotic behavior we are looking for.

    In three dimensions, even autonomous systems can be chaotic. Let us very briefly
return to the Lorenz system

           = -10 + 10,        = 28 -  - ,                                              = -8 + .
                                                                                              3

The Lorenz system is an autonomous system in three dimensions exhibiting chaotic
behavior. See Figure 8.15 for a sample trajectory, which is now a curve in three-dimensional
space.

    The solutions tend to an attractor in space, the so-called Lorenz attractor. In this case, no
strobing is necessary, the solution will tend towards the attractor set. Again we cannot
quite see the attractor itself, but if we try to follow a solution for long enough, as in the
figure, we get a pretty good picture of what the attractor looks like. The Lorenz attractor is
also a strange attractor and has a complicated fractal structure. And, just as for the Duffing
equation, what we want to draw is not the whole trajectory, but start drawing the trajectory
after a while, once it is close to the attractor.

    The path of the trajectory is not simply a repeating figure-eight. The trajectory spins
some seemingly random number of times on the left, then spins a number of times on the
right, and so on. As this system arose in weather prediction, one can perhaps imagine a few
days of warm weather and then a few days of cold weather, where it is not easy to predict
when the weather will change, just as it is not really easy to predict far in advance when
the solution will jump onto the other side. See Figure 8.16 for a plot of the  component of
the solution drawn above. A negative  corresponds to the left "loop" and a positive 
corresponds to the right "loop". On the other hand, while we cannot predict the weather,
we can say something about the climate--the weather will be somewhere near the attractor.

    Most of the mathematics we studied in this book is quite classical and well understood.
On the other hand, chaos, including the Lorenz system, continues to be the subject of
current research. Furthermore, chaos has found applications not just in the sciences, but
also in art.

Linear algebra

A.1 Vectors, mappings, and matrices

Note: 2 lectures
    In real life, there is most often more than one variable. We wish to organize dealing with

multiple variables in a consistent manner, and in particular organize dealing with linear
equations and linear mappings, as those are both rather useful and rather easy to handle.
Mathematicians joke that "to an engineer every problem is linear, and everything is a
matrix." And well, they (the engineers) are not wrong. Quite often, solving an engineering
problem is figuring out the right finite-dimensional linear problem to solve, which is
then solved with some matrix manipulation. Most importantly, linear problems are the
ones that we know how to solve, and we have many tools to solve them. For engineers,
mathematicians, physicists, and anybody else in a technical field, it is absolutely vital to
learn linear algebra.

    As motivation, suppose we wish to solve

                                                     -  = 2,
                                                    2 +  = 4,

for  and . That is, we desire numbers  and  such that the two equations are satisfied.
Let us perhaps start by adding the equations together to find

                                 + 2 -  +  = 2 + 4, or 3 = 6.

In other words,  = 2. Once we have that, we plug  = 2 into the first equation to find
2 -  = 2, so  = 0. OK, that was easy. What is all this fuss about linear equations? Well,
try doing this if you have 5000 unknowns. Also, we may have such equations not just of
numbers, but of functions and derivatives of functions in differential equations. Clearly we
need a systematic way of doing things. A nice consequence of making things systematic

     One of the downsides of making everything look like a linear problem is that the number of variables
tends to become huge.
386  APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

and simpler to write down is that it becomes easier to have computers do the work for us.
Computers are very good at doing lots of repetitive tasks precisely, as long as we figure out
a systematic way for them to perform the tasks.

A.1.1 Vectors and operations on vectors

Consider  real numbers as an -tuple:

                                                 (1, 2, . . . , ).

The set of such -tuples is the so-called -dimensional space, often denoted by . Sometimes
we call this the -dimensional euclidean space. In two dimensions, 2 is called the cartesian
plane. Each such -tuple represents a point in the -dimensional space. For example, the
point (1, 2) in the plane 2 is one unit to the right and two units up from the origin.

    When we do algebra with these -tuples of numbers we call them vectors. Mathemati-
cians are keen on separating what is a vector and what is a point of the space or in the
plane, and it turns out to be an important distinction, however, for the purposes of linear
algebra we can think of everything being represented by a vector. A way to think of a
vector, which is especially useful in calculus and differential equations, is an arrow. It is an
object that has a direction and a magnitude. For instance, the vector (1, 2) is the arrow from
the origin to the point (1, 2) in the plane. The magnitude is the length of the arrow. See
Figure A.1. If we think of vectors as arrows, the arrow does not always have to start at the
origin. If we do move it around, however, it should always keep the same direction and
the same magnitude.

                                2
                                 2
                                 1

                                 0 0 1 2 3 1

     Figure A.1: The vector (1, 2) drawn as an arrow from the origin to the point (1, 2).

    As vectors are arrows, when we want to give a name to a vector, we draw a little arrow

above it:
                                                          ì

     Named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria (around 300 BC), possibly the most
famous of mathematicians; even small towns often have Euclid Street or Euclid Avenue.

     Named after the French mathematician René Descartes (1596-1650). It is "cartesian" as his name in
Latin is Renatus Cartesius.

     A common notation to distinguish vectors from points is to write (1, 2) for the point and 1, 2 for the
vector. We write both as (1, 2).
A.1. VECTORS, MAPPINGS, AND MATRICES                                            387

Another popular notation is a bold x, although we will use the little arrows. It may be easy
to write a bold letter in a book, but it is not so easy to write it by hand on paper or on the
board. Mathematicians often do not even write the arrows. A mathematician would write
 and remember that  is a vector and not a number. Just like you remember that Bob is
your uncle, and you don't have to keep repeating "Uncle Bob" and you can just say "Bob."
In this book, however, we will call Bob "Uncle Bob" and write vectors with the little arrows.

    The magnitude can be computed using the Pythagorean theorem. The vector (1, 2)
                                                             

drawn in the figure has magnitude 12 + 22 = 5. The magnitude is denoted by ì, and,
in any number of dimensions, it can be computed in the same way:

                 ì = (1, 2, . . . , ) =       2    +  2    +  ·  ·  ·  +  2  .

                                                1       2

For reasons that will become clear in the next section, we often write vectors as so-called

column vectors:        1

                       
                       2
                 ì  =    ..                .
                       .                 

                         

Don't worry. It is just a different way of writing the same thing. For example, the vector
(1, 2) can be written as

                                                         1.
                                                         2

    The fact that we write arrows above vectors allows us to write several vectors ì1, ì2,
etc., without confusing these with the components of some other vector ì.

    So where is the algebra from linear algebra? Well, arrows can be added, subtracted, and
multiplied by numbers. First we consider addition. If we have two arrows, we simply move

along one, and then along the other. See Figure A.2.

                                      2
                                        2

                                        0 0 1 2 3 1
                                      -1

Figure A.2: Adding the vectors (1, 2), drawn dotted, and (2, -3), drawn dashed. The result, (3, -1), is
drawn as a solid arrow.
388                                                                    APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

    It is rather easy to see what it does to the numbers that represent the vectors. Suppose
we want to add (1, 2) to (2, -3) as in the figure. We travel along (1, 2) and then we travel
along (2, -3). What we did was travel one unit right, two units up, and then we travelled

two units right, and three units down (the negative three). That means that we ended up
at 1 + 2, 2 + (-3) = (3, -1). That is how addition always works:

                             1 1  1 + 1                                
                               
                             2 2  2 + 2 
                               ..    +         ..      =        ..       .
                             . .  .                                    

                                + 

    Subtracting is similar. What ì - ì means visually is that we first travel along ì, and then
we travel backwards along ì. See Figure A.3. It is like adding ì + (-ì) where -ì is the

arrow we obtain by erasing the arrow head from one side and drawing it on the other side,

that is, we reverse the direction. In terms of the numbers, we simply go backwards both
horizontally and vertically, so we negate both numbers. For instance, if ì is (-2, 1), then
-ì is (2, -1).

                                      2
                                        2

                                        1

                                        0 0 1 2 3 1

Figure A.3: Subtraction, the vector (1, 2), drawn dotted, minus (-2, 1), drawn dashed. The result, (3, 1),
is drawn as a solid arrow.

Another intuitive thing to do to a vector is to scale it. We represent this by multiplication

of a number with a vector. Because of this, when we wish to distinguish between vectors

and numbers, we call the numbers scalars. For example, suppose we want to travel three
times further. If the vector is (1, 2), travelling 3 times further means going 3 units to the
right and 6 units up, so we get the vector (3, 6). We just multiply each number in the vector

by 3. If  is a number, then

                                       1 1
                                         
                                       2 2
                                           ..        =      ..      .
                                       .  .                     

                                        

Scaling (by a positive number) multiplies the magnitude and leaves direction untouched.
The magnitude of (1, 2) is 5. The magnitude of 3 times (1, 2), that is, of (3, 6), is 3 5.
A.1. VECTORS, MAPPINGS, AND MATRICES                                                                     389

    If we multiply a vector by a negative scalar, the vector is not only scaled, but it also
switches direction. Multiplying (1, 2) by -3 means we should go 3 times further but in the
opposite direction, so 3 units to the left and 6 units down, or in other words, (-3, -6). As
we mentioned above, -ì is the reverse of ì, and this is the same as (-1)ì.

    In Figure A.4, you can see a couple of examples of what scaling a vector means visually.

                                                                    -1.5ì
                                                       2ì
                                         ì

Figure A.4: A vector ì, the vector 2ì (same direction, double the magnitude), and the vector -1.5ì
(opposite direction, 1.5 times the magnitude).

    We put all of these operations together to work out more complicated expressions. Let
us compute a small example:

                     3 12 + 2 -4 -1 - 3 -22 = 3(1) + 2(-4) - 3(-2) 3(2) + 2(-1) - 3(2) = 1-2 .

     We said a vector is a direction and a magnitude. Magnitude is easy to represent, it is

just a number. The direction is usually given by a vector with magnitude one. We call such

a vector a unit vector. That is, ì is a unit vector when ì = 1. For instance, the vectors
                    
(1,  0),                  and  (0,  -1)  are  all  unit  vectors.
          (1/ 2,  1/ 2),

     To represent the direction of a vector ì, we need to find the unit vector in the same

direction.  To do so, we simply rescale               ì by the reciprocal of the magnitude:   1  ì,  or  more
                                                                                             ì

concisely, ì ì .

     As an example, the unit vector in the direction of (1, 2) is the vector

                                                   1               12
                                                         (1, 2) =  ,  .

                                              12 + 22               55

A.1.2 Linear mappings and matrices

A vector-valued function  is a rule that takes a vector ì and returns another vector ì. For
example,  could be a scaling that doubles the size of vectors:

                                                         (ì) = 2ì.

Applied to say (1, 3) we get

                                               1 =2 1 = 2 .
                                                      3  36
390                                             APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

If  is a mapping that takes vectors in 2 to 2 (such as the above), we write
                                                 : 2  2.

The words function and mapping are used rather interchangeably, although more often than

not, mapping is used when talking about a vector-valued function, and the word function is

often used when the function is scalar-valued.

A beginning student of mathematics (and many a seasoned mathematician) who sees

an expression such as

                                    (3 + 8)

yearns to write
                                                  3  () + 8  ().

After all, who has not wanted to write   +  =  +  or something like that at some
point in their mathematical lives? Wouldn't life be simple if we could do that? Of course
we cannot always do that (for example, not with the square roots!) But there are many
other functions where we can do exactly the above. Such functions are called linear.

    A mapping  :    is called linear if

                                   (ì + ì) = (ì) + (ì),

for any vectors ì and ì, and also

                                   (ì) = (ì),

for any scalar . The  we defined above that doubles the size of all vectors is linear. Let

us check:

                       (ì + ì) = 2(ì + ì) = 2ì + 2ì = (ì) + (ì),

and also

                       (ì) = 2ì = 2ì = (ì).

    We also call a linear function a linear transformation. If you want to be really fancy and
impress your friends, you can call it a linear operator. When a mapping is linear we often do
not write the parentheses. We write simply

                                    ì

instead of (ì). We do this because linearity means that the mapping  behaves like
multiplying ì by "something." That something is a matrix.

    A matrix is an  ×  array of numbers ( rows and  columns). A 3 × 5 matrix is

                                           11 12 13 14 15
                                      = 21 22 23 24 25 .

                                           31 32 33 34 35

The numbers  are called elements or entries.
A.1. VECTORS, MAPPINGS, AND MATRICES                                                                391

    A column vector is simply an  × 1 matrix. Similarly to a column vector there is also a
row vector, which is a 1 ×  matrix. If we have an  ×  matrix, then we say that it is a square

matrix.
    How does a matrix  relate to a linear mapping? A matrix tells you where certain

special vectors go. We give a name to those certain vectors. The standard basis vectors of 

are              1                    0                    0                           0

In 3, these vectors are

                             ì1  =  0    ,       ì2  =  1     ,       ì3  =  0  .
                                                                             
                                    0                   0                    1
                                                                             

You may recall from calculus of several variables that these are sometimes called ì, ì, ì.

    The reason these are called a basis is that every other vector can be written as a unique
linear combination of them. For example, in 3 the vector (4, 5, 6) can be written as

                                                    1 0 0 4
                                                       
                        4ì1  +   5ì2  +  6ì3  =  4  0   +  5  1   +   6   0  =  5  .
                                                                                
                                                    0 0 1 6
                                                       

    So how does a matrix represent a linear mapping? Well, the columns of the matrix are
the vectors where the matrix, as a linear mapping, takes ì1, ì2, etc. For instance, consider

                                              = 1 2 .
                                                      34

As a linear mapping,  : 2  2 takes ì1 =                       1   to      1  and ì2 =  0  to  2  .  In other
words,                                                        0           3            1      4

                  ì1 = 1 2 1 3 4 0 = 13 , and                     ì2 = 1 2 0 3 4 1 = 24 .

    More generally, if we have an  ×  matrix , that is, we have  rows and  columns,
then the mapping  :    takes ì to the th column of . For example,

                                         11 12 13 14 15
                                     = 21 22 23 24 25

                                         31 32 33 34 35

represents a mapping from 5 to 3 that does

             11          12                           13                         14               15
     ì1 = 21 ,   ì2 = 22 ,                    ì3 = 23 ,                  ì4 = 24 ,        ì5 = 25 .

             31          32                           33                         34               35
392                                                     APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

    What about another vector ì that is not in the standard basis? Where does it go? We use
linearity. First, we write the vector as a linear combination of the standard basis vectors:

        1        1        0        0        0        0
              
        2        0        1        0        0        0
              
ì    =  3  =  1  0  +  2  0  +  3  1  +  4  0  +  5  0  =  1 ì1  +  2 ì2  +  3 ì3  +  4 ì4  +  5 ì5 .
                                                     
        4        0        0        0        1        0
              
        5        0        0        0        0        1
              

Then

    ì = (1ì1 + 2ì2 + 3ì3 + 4ì4 + 5ì5) = 1ì1 + 2ì2 + 3ì3 + 4ì4 + 5ì5.

If we know where  takes all the basis vectors, we know where it takes all vectors.
    Suppose  is the 2 × 2 matrix from above, then

                          -2 0.1 = 1 2 -2 3 4 0.1 = -2 13 + 0.1 24 = -1.8 -5.6 .

    Every linear mapping from  to  can be represented by an  ×  matrix. You
just figure out where it takes the standard basis vectors. Conversely, every  ×  matrix
represents a linear mapping. Hence, we may think of matrices being linear mappings, and
linear mappings being matrices.

    Or can we? In this book we study mostly linear differential operators, and linear
differential operators are linear mappings, although they are not acting on , but on an
infinite-dimensional space of functions:

                                             = .

For a function  we get a function , and  is linear in the sense that

                       (  + ) =   + , and (  ) =   .

for any number (scalar)  and all functions  and .
    So the answer is not really. But if we consider vectors in finite-dimensional spaces

 then yes, every linear mapping is a matrix. We have mentioned at the beginning of
this section, that we can "make everything a vector." That's not strictly true, but it is true
approximately. Those "infinite-dimensional" spaces of functions can be approximated by a
finite-dimensional space, and then linear operators are just matrices. So approximately,
this is true. And as far as actual computations that we can do on a computer, we can work
only with finitely many dimensions anyway. If you ask a computer or your calculator to
plot a function, it samples the function at finitely many points and then connects the dots.

     If you have ever used Matlab, you may have noticed that to plot a function, we take a vector of inputs,
ask Matlab to compute the corresponding vector of values of the function, and then we ask it to plot the
result.

It does not actually give you infinitely many values. The way that you have been using the
computer or your calculator so far has already been a certain approximation of the space
of functions by a finite-dimensional space.

    To end the section, we notice how ì can be written more succinctly. Suppose

                     = 11 12 13                             1
                           21 22 23         and ì = 2 .

                                                            3

Then                     11  12  13   1     111 + 122 + 133
For example,                              
                    ì =               2 =                              .
                         21 22 23   211 + 222 + 233
                                      3

                         1 2 2 = 1 · 2 + 2 · (-1) = 0 .
                         3 4 -1 3 · 2 + 4 · (-1) 2

That is, you take the entries in a row of the matrix, you multiply them by the entries in
your vector, you add things up, and that's the corresponding entry in the resulting vector.

A.2 Matrix algebra

Note: 2-3 lectures

A.2.1 One-by-one matrices

Let us motivate what we want to achieve with matrices. Real-valued linear mappings of the
real line, linear functions that eat numbers and spit out numbers, are just multiplications
by a number. Consider a mapping defined by multiplying by a number. Let's call this
number . The mapping then takes  to . We can add such mappings: If we have another
mapping , then

                                               +  = ( + ).

We get a new mapping  +  that multiplies  by, well,  + . If  is a mapping that doubles
its input,  = 2, and  is a mapping that triples,  = 3, then  +  is a mapping that
multiplies by 5, ( + ) = 5.

    Similarly we can compose such mappings, that is, we could apply one and then the other.
We take , we run it through the first mapping  to get  times , then we run  through
the second mapping . In other words,

                                                 () = ().

We just multiply those two numbers. Using our doubling and tripling mappings, if we
double and then triple, that is, (), then we obtain 3(2) = 6. The composition  is
the mapping that multiplies by 6. For larger matrices, composition also ends up being a
kind of multiplication.

A.2.2 Matrix addition and scalar multiplication

The mappings that multiply numbers by numbers are just 1 × 1 matrices. The number 
above could be written as a matrix []. Perhaps we would want to do to all matrices the
same things that we did to those 1 × 1 matrices at the start of this section above. First, let
us add matrices. If we have a matrix  and a matrix  that are of the same size, say  × ,
then they are mappings from  to . The mapping  +  should also be a mapping
from  to , and it should do the following to vectors:

                    ( + )ì = ì + ì.

It turns out you just add the matrices element-wise: If the th entry of  is , and the th
entry of  is , then the th entry of  +  is  + . If

We illustrate on a more concrete example:

           3    4    +    9  10   =        3  +  9    4 + 10 = 12 14 .

Let us check that this does the right thing to a vector. We use some of the vector algebra
that we already know, and regroup things:

                                = 12 14 2

                                                                         2(16)    -  5    27
                                                                                        

If we replaced the numbers by letters, that would constitute a proof! Notice that we did not

really have to compute what the result is to convince ourselves that the two expressions

were equal.
    If the sizes of the matrices do not match, then addition is undefined. If  is 3 × 2 and 

is 2 × 5, then we cannot add the matrices. We do not know what that could possibly mean.

    It is also useful to have a matrix that when added to any other matrix does nothing.
This is the zero matrix, the matrix of all zeros:

                             1 2+0 0=1 2.
                             34 00 34

We often denote the zero matrix by 0 without specifying size. We would then just write
 + 0, where we just assume that 0 is the zero matrix of the same size as .

    There are really two things we can multiply matrices by. We can multiply matrices by
scalars or we can multiply by other matrices. Let us first consider multiplication by scalars.
For a matrix  and a scalar , we want  to be the matrix that accomplishes

                                ()ì = (ì).
398                                           APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

That is just scaling the result by . If you think about it, scaling every term in  by 
achieves just that: If

               = 11 12 13 ,             then   = 11 12 13  . 21 22 23
                     21 22 23

For example,

              21 2 3 = 2 4 6 .
                 4 5 6 8 10 12

    Let us list some properties of matrix addition and scalar multiplication. Denote by 0
the zero matrix, by ,  scalars, and by , ,  matrices. Then:

                       + 0 =  = 0 + ,
                      +  =  + ,
              ( + ) +  =  + ( + ),
                 ( + ) =  + ,
                 ( + ) =  + .

These rules should look very familiar.

A.2.3 Matrix multiplication

As we mentioned above, composition of linear mappings is also a multiplication of matrices.
Suppose  is an  ×  matrix, that is,  takes  to , and  is an  ×  matrix, that is, 
takes  to . The composition  should work as follows

                                                  ì = (ì).

First, a vector ì in  gets taken to the vector ì in . Then the mapping  takes it to the
vector (ì) in . In other words, the composition  should be an  ×  matrix. In
terms of sizes we should have

                                     " [ × ] [ × ] = [ × ]. "

Notice how the middle size must match.
    OK, now we know what sizes of matrices we should be able to multiply and what the

product should be. Let us see how to actually compute matrix multiplication. We start
with the so-called dot product (or inner product) of two vectors. Usually this is a row vector
multiplied with a column vector of the same size. Dot product multiplies each pair of
entries from the first and the second vector and sums these products. The result is a single
number. For example,

                                                 1
                                                 
                                 1 2 3 · 2 = 11 + 22 + 33.
                                                 3
A.2. MATRIX ALGEBRA                                                                  399

And similarly for larger (or smaller) vectors. A dot product is really a product of two
matrices: a 1 ×  matrix and an  × 1 matrix resulting in a 1 × 1 matrix--a number.

    Armed with the dot product we define the product of matrices. We denote by row()
the th row of  and by column() the th column of . For an  ×  matrix  and an
 ×  matrix  we can compute the product : The matrix  is an  ×  matrix whose
th entry is the dot product

                                             row() · column().

For example, given a 2 × 3 and a 3 × 2 matrix we should end up with a 2 × 2 matrix:

       11 12 13  11 12 1111 + 1221 + 1331       1112 + 1222 + 1332 ,
              21 22 =                           2112 + 2222 + 2332                   (A.1)
     21 22 23           2111 + 2221 + 2331
              31 32

or with some numbers:

1 2 3 -  1 2  1 · (-1) + 2 · (-7) + 3 · 1     1 · 2 + 2 · 0 + 3 · (-1) = -12 -1 .
     -7 0  =                                  4 · 2 + 5 · 0 + 6 · (-1) -33 2
4 5 6 1 -1       4 · (-1) + 5 · (-7) + 6 · 1

    A useful consequence of the definition is that the evaluation ì for a matrix  and a
(column) vector ì is also matrix multiplication. That is really why we think of vectors as
column vectors, or  × 1 matrices. For example,

                       1 2 2 = 1 · 2 + 2 · (-1) = 0 .
                       3 4 -1 3 · 2 + 4 · (-1) 2

If you look at the last section, that is precisely the last example we gave.
    You should stare at the computation of multiplication of matrices  and the previous

definition of ì as a mapping for a moment. What we are doing with matrix multiplication
is applying the mapping  to the columns of . This is usually written as follows. Suppose
we write the  ×  matrix  = [ì1 ì2 · · · ì], where ì1, ì2, . . . , ì are the columns of .
Then for an  ×  matrix ,

                                = [ì1 ì2 · · · ì] = [ì1 ì2 · · · ì].

The columns of the  ×  matrix  are the vectors ì1, ì2, . . . , ì. For example, in

(A.1), the columns of    11 12 13  11 12

                       21 22 23 21 22         
                                31 32

are             11 12 13  11                    11 12 13  12

                       21 and                                22 .
              21 22 23                        21 22 23  
                       31                                    32

This is a very useful way to understand what matrix multiplication is. It should also make

it easier to remember how to perform matrix multiplication.

A.2.4 Some rules of matrix algebra

For multiplication we want an analogue of a 1. That is, we desire a matrix that just leaves
everything as it found it. This analogue is the so-called identity matrix. The identity matrix
is a square matrix with 1s on the main diagonal and zeros everywhere else. It is usually
denoted by . For each size we have a different identity matrix and so sometimes we may
denote the size as a subscript. For example, 3 is the 3 × 3 identity matrix

                                                       1 0 0
                                             = 3 = 0 1 0 .

                                                       0 0 1

Let us see how the matrix works on a smaller example,

      11 12  1 0 = 11 · 1 + 12 · 0         11 · 0 + 12 · 1 = 11 12 .
      21 22  0 1 21 · 1 + 22 · 0           21 · 0 + 22 · 1  21 22

Multiplication by the identity from the left looks similar, and also does not touch anything.

    We have the following rules for matrix multiplication. Suppose that , ,  are matrices
of the correct sizes so that the following make sense. Let  denote a scalar (number). Then

         () = ()                               (associative law),
      ( + ) =  +                               (distributive law),
      ( + ) =  +                               (distributive law),

         () = () = (),                         (identity).
               =  = 

Example A.2.1: Let us demonstrate a couple of these rules. For example, the associative

law:  -3 3 4 4 -1 4 = -3 3 16 24 = -96 -78 ,

      2 -2 1 -3 5 2                      2 -2 -16 -2        64 52

                                                            ()

and   -3 3 4 4 -1 4 = -9 -21 -1 4 = -96 -78 .

      2 -2 1 -3 5 2                      6 14 5 2           64 52

                                                            ()

Or how about multiplication by scalars:

        10 -3 3 2 -2   44                = 10 -9 -21 = -90 -210 ,
                       1 -3              6 14    60 140
                     
                                                      10()
A.2. MATRIX ALGEBRA                                                                                    401

              10 -3 3 2 -2          4 4 = -30 30 4 4 = -90 -210 ,
                                    1 -3         20 -20 1 -3              60 140

                                                     10                          (10)

and
                   -3 3 2 -2 10 4 4 1 -3 = -3 3 40 40 2 -2 10 -30 = -90 -210 60 140 .

                                                                10               (10)

A multiplication rule, one you have used since primary school on numbers, is quite

conspicuously missing for matrices. That is, matrix multiplication is not commutative.

Firstly, just because  makes sense, it may be that  is not even defined. For example, if

 is 2 × 3, and  is 3 × 4, then we can multiply  but not .

Even if  and  are both defined, it does not mean that they are equal. For example,

take  =  11       and  =      10 :
         11
                              02

          = 1 1 1 0 = 1 2  1 1 = 1 0 1 1 = .
                     11 02 12                                   22 02 11

A.2.5 Inverse

A couple of other algebra rules you know for numbers do not quite work on matrices:
   (i)  =  does not necessarily imply  = , even if  is not 0.
  (ii)  = 0 does not necessarily mean that  = 0 or  = 0.

For example:

                              0 1 0 1=0 0=0 1 0 2.
                              00 00 00 00 00

    To make these rules hold, we do not just need one of the matrices to not be zero, we

would need to "divide" by a matrix. This is where the matrix inverse comes in. Suppose
that  and  are  ×  matrices such that

                                              =  = .

Then we call  the inverse of  and we denote  by -1. Perhaps not surprisingly,

(-1)-1 = , since if the inverse of  is , then the inverse of  is . If the inverse of 

exists, then we say  is invertible. If  is not invertible, we say  is singular.

If    =  []   is  a  1  ×  1  matrix,  then  -1  is  -1  =  1.  That  is  where  the  notation  comes  from.

                                                            

The computation is not nearly as simple when  is larger.

The proper formulation of the cancellation rule is:

                              If  is invertible, then  =  implies  = .
402                                              APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

The computation is what you would do in regular algebra with numbers, but you have to
be careful never to commute matrices:

                                                     = ,
                                               -1 = -1,

                                                      = ,
                                                        = .

And similarly for cancellation on the right:
                              If  is invertible, then  =  implies  = .

    The rule says, among other things, that the inverse of a matrix is unique if it exists: If
 =  = , then  is invertible and  = .

    We will see later how to compute an inverse of a matrix in general. For now, let us note
that there is a simple formula for the inverse of a 2 × 2 matrix

                            -1 1          - .
                                    =
                                  -  - 

    For example:  1 1 -1      1        4 -1         2 -1/2
Let's try it:             =                      =              1.
                  24         1 · 4 - 1 · 2 -2 1     -1 /2

     1 1 2 -1/2 1 0                              1 2 = -1/2 1 1 1 0 .
                  1=             and
     2 4 -1 /2            01                     -1 /2 2 4 0 1

Just as we cannot divide by every number, not every matrix is invertible. In the case of
matrices however we may have singular matrices that are not zero. For example,

                                 11
                                 22

is a singular matrix. But didn't we just give a formula for an inverse? Let us try it:

                      ? 1 1 -1
                                 1       2 -1
                      2 2 = 1 · 2 - 1 · 2 -2 1 =

We get into a bit of trouble; we are trying to divide by zero.
    So a 2 × 2 matrix  is invertible whenever

                                  -   0

and otherwise it is singular. The expression  -  is called the determinant and we will
look at it more carefully in a later section. There is a similar expression for a square matrix
of any size.

A.2.6 Diagonal matrices

A simple (and surprisingly useful) type of a square matrix is a so-called diagonal matrix. It

is a matrix whose entries are all zero except those on the main diagonal from top left to
bottom right. For example a 4 × 4 diagonal matrix is of the form

                                   1        0     0        0  
                                                              
                                     0    2       0        0
                                    0 0 3 0  .
                                                           4  
                                     0      0     0

Such matrices have nice properties when we multiply by them. If we multiply them by a
vector, they multiply the th entry by . For example,

                           1    0    0 4          1 · 4            4
                                                  2                
                           0    2    0  5      =        ·  5    =  10    .
                                        
                           0    0    3 6          3 · 6            18
                                       

Similarly, when they multiply another matrix from the left, they multiply the th row by .

For example,             2 0         1         1                                  
                                                                                  
                         0 3  0      1    1    1             2     2        2     
                                                                                  
                              0           1         =        3     3        3       .

                         0 0 -1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1

On the other hand, multiplying on the right, they multiply the columns:

                         1 1 1 2 0               0           2 3 -1
                         1 1 1 0 3                           2        -1 .
                                                 0      =          3

                         1 1 1 0 0 -1 2 3 -1

And it is really easy to multiply two diagonal matrices together--we multiply the entries:

              1 0 0 2 0       0         1 · 2        0             0              2 0     0  
              0 2 0 0 3                                                           0          
                              0      =    0       2·3              0        =          6  0    .

              0 0 3 0 0 -1                0          0 3 · (-1) 0 0 -3
                                        

For this last reason, they are easy to invert, you simply invert each diagonal element:

                         1 0 0  -1 -1 0 0                                  
                                         1                    -1           
                           0  2      0        =      0                0        .
                                                                2
                          0 0 3  0 0 -1
                                                                      3

Let us check an example

              2 0 0-1 2 0 0               1      0    0 2          0  0             1 0 0
                                       1                                                  
                                           2
              0 3 0 0 3 0 = 0 3 0 0 3 0 = 0 1 0 .
              0 0 4      0 0 4            0 0 1  0 0 4                              0 0 1
                                                      4                  

                -1                             -1                                      

It is no wonder that the way we solve many problems in linear algebra (and in differential
equations) is to try to reduce the problem to the case of diagonal matrices.

A.2.7 Transpose

Vectors do not always have to be column vectors, that is just a convention. Swapping rows
and columns is from time to time needed. The operation that swaps rows and columns is
the so-called transpose. The transpose of  is denoted by . Example:

                                1 2 3   = 1 4 2 5 .
                                456  
                                     3 6

Transpose takes an  ×  matrix to an  ×  matrix.
    A key feature of the transpose is that if the product  makes sense, then   also

makes sense, at least from the point of view of sizes. In fact, we get precisely the transpose

of . That is:                   () =   .

For example,

                     1  2  3  0 1    0 1 2 1 4
                                
                     4 5 6 1 0  = 1 0 -2 2 5 .
                              2 -2                   3 6

It is left to the reader to verify that computing the matrix product on the left and then

transposing is the same as computing the matrix product on the right.
    If we have a column vector ì to which we apply a matrix  and we transpose the result,

then the row vector ì applies to  from the left:

                                (ì) = ì  .

Another place where transpose is useful is when we wish to apply the dot product to

two column vectors:

                                ì · ì = ì ì.

That is the way that one often writes the dot product in software.
    We say a matrix  is symmetric if  = . For example,

                                                  1 2 3
                                                  2 4 5
                                                  3 5 6

is a symmetric matrix. Notice that a symmetric matrix is always square, that is,  × .
Symmetric matrices have many nice properties, and come up quite often in applications.

     As a side note, mathematicians write ì ì and physicists write ì ì. Shhh. . . don't tell anyone, but the

physicists are probably right on this.
     Although so far we have not learned enough about matrices to really appreciate them.

A.3 Elimination

Note: 2-3 lectures

A.3.1 Linear systems of equations

One application of matrices is to solve systems of linear equations. Consider the following

system of linear equations

                                21 + 22 + 23 = 2,

                                   1 + 2 + 33 = 5,      (A.2)

                                   1 + 42 + 3 = 10.

    There is a systematic procedure called elimination to solve such a system. In this

procedure, we attempt to eliminate each variable from all but one equation. We want to
end up with equations such as 3 = 2, where we can just read off the answer.

    We write a system of linear equations as a matrix equation:

                                      ì = ì.

The system (A.2) is written as

                                2 2 2 1        2
                                               
                                1  1  3  2  =  5     .
                                               
                                1 4 1 3 10

                                         ì     ì

If we knew the inverse of , then we would be done; we would simply solve the equation:

                                   ì = -1ì = -1ì.

Well, but that is part of the problem, we do not know how to compute the inverse for
matrices bigger than 2 × 2. We will see later that to compute the inverse we are really
solving ì = ì for several different ì. In other words, we will need to do elimination to
find -1. In addition, we may wish to solve ì = ì if  is not invertible, or perhaps not
even square.

    Let us return to the equations themselves and see how we can manipulate them. There
are a few operations we can perform on the equations that do not change the solution.
First, perhaps an operation that may seem stupid, we can swap two equations in (A.2):

                                               1 + 2 + 33 = 5,
                                             21 + 22 + 23 = 2,

                                               1 + 42 + 3 = 10.

     Although perhaps we have this backwards, quite often we solve a linear system of equations to find out
something about matrices, rather than vice versa.
408                                                                       APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

Clearly these new equations have the same solutions 1, 2, 3. A second operation is that

we can multiply an equation by a nonzero number. For example, we multiply the third

equation in (A.2) by 3:

                         21 + 22 + 23 = 2,

                                      1 + 2 + 33 = 5,

                         31 + 122 + 33 = 30.

Finally, we can add a multiple of one equation to another equation. For instance, we add 3
times the third equation in (A.2) to the second equation:

                               21 +           22 +                   23 = 2,
                         (1 + 3)1 +   (1 + 12)2 +              (3 + 3)3 = 5 + 30,

                                 1 +          42 +                     3 = 10.

The same 1, 2, 3 should still be solutions to the new equations. These were just examples;
we did not get any closer to the solution. We must do these three operations in some more
logical manner, but it turns out these three operations suffice to solve every linear equation.

    The first thing is to write the equations in a more compact manner. Given

                                           ì = ì,

we write down the so-called augmented matrix
                                                      [ | ì],

where the vertical line is just a marker for us to know where the "right-hand side" of the
equation starts. For the system (A.2) the augmented matrix is

                                        2  2  2                2    
                                                                    
                                        1  1  3                5       .

                                        1  4  1     10              
                                                                    

The entire process of elimination, which we will describe, is often applied to any sort of
matrix, not just an augmented matrix. Simply think of the matrix as the 3 × 4 matrix

                                        2 2 2                  2  
                                        1 1 3                     
                                                               5    .

A.3.2 Row echelon form and elementary operations

We apply the three operations above to the matrix. We call these the elementary operations
or elementary row operations. Translating the operations to the matrix setting, the operations
become:
A.3. ELIMINATION                                                                       409

(i) Swap two rows.

(ii) Multiply a row by a nonzero number.

(iii) Add a multiple of one row to another row.

We run these operations until we get into a state where it is easy to read off the answer, or
until we get into a contradiction indicating no solution.

    More specifically, we run the operations until we obtain the so-called row echelon form.
Let us call the first (from the left) nonzero entry in each row the leading entry. A matrix is
in row echelon form if the following conditions are satisfied:

(i) The leading entry in any row is strictly to the right of the leading entry of the row
    above.

(ii) Any zero rows are below all the nonzero rows.

(iii) All leading entries are 1.

A matrix is in reduced row echelon form if furthermore the following condition is satisfied.

(iv) All the entries above a leading entry are zero.

Note that the definition applies to matrices of any size.

Example A.3.1: The following matrices are in row echelon form. The leading entries are
marked:

1    2  9         3      1              -1 -3        1  2 1     0     1     -5    2  
                                                        1 2     0 0                  
  0  0  1         5               0     1     5                                      
                                                     0  0 0     0 0         0     1  
                                                                                     
  0  0  0         1               0     0     1      0                      0     0

None of the matrices above are in reduced row echelon form. For example, in the first matrix
none of the entries above the second and third leading entries are zero; they are 9, 3, and 5.
The following matrices are in reduced row echelon form. The leading entries are marked:

  1  3  0  8           1             0     2  0      1  0  3       0     1     2  0  
           6                                            1 -2       0                 
                         0           1     3  0    
  0  0  1  0                                         0             0     0     0  1  
                                                                                     
  0  0  0                0           0     0  1      0  0  0             0     0  0

    The procedure we will describe to find a reduced row echelon form of a matrix is called
Gauss-Jordan elimination. The first part of it, which obtains a row echelon form, is called
Gaussian elimination or row reduction. For some problems, a row echelon form is sufficient,
and it is a bit less work to only do this first part.

    To attain the row echelon form we work systematically. We go column by column,
starting at the first column. We find topmost entry in the first column that is not zero, and
we call it the pivot. If there is no nonzero entry we move to the next column. We swap rows
410                                                    APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

to put the row with the pivot as the first row. We divide the first row by the pivot to make
the pivot entry be a 1. Now look at all the rows below and subtract the correct multiple of
the pivot row so that all the entries below the pivot become zero.

    After this procedure we forget that we had a first row (it is now fixed), and we forget
about the column with the pivot and all the preceding zero columns. Below the pivot row,
all the entries in these columns are just zero. Then we focus on the smaller matrix and we
repeat the steps above.

    It is best shown by example, so let us go back to the example from the beginning of the
section. We keep the vertical line in the matrix, even though the procedure works on any
matrix, not just an augmented matrix. We start with the first column and we locate the
pivot, in this case the first entry of the first column.

                                       2  22    2    
                                                     
                                       1  13    5
                                                     
                                       1  4  1  10   

We multiply the first row by 1/2.

                                       1  11    1    
                                                     
                                       1  13    5
                                                     
                                       1  4  1  10   

We subtract the first row from the second and third row (two elementary operations).

                                       1  1  1  1  
                                                   
                                       0  0  2  4
                                                   
                                       0  3  0  9  

We are done with the first column and the first row for now. We almost pretend the matrix
does not have the first column and the first row.

                                                   
                                                   
                                          0  2  4  
                                                   
                                          3  0  9  
                                                   

OK, look at the second column, and notice that now the pivot is in the third row.

                                   1      1  1  1
                                                  
                                   0      0  2  4
                                                    
                                       0  3  0  9   

We swap rows.                      1            1
                                                  
                                          1  1      
                                                    
                                       0  3  0  9   
                                                    
                                       0  0  2  4
A.3. ELIMINATION                                                                      411

And we divide the pivot row by 3.

                                      1         1     1     1  
                                                               
                                          0     1     0     3
                                                               
                                          0     0     2     4  

We do not need to subtract anything as everything below the pivot is already zero. We
move on. We again start ignoring the second row and second column and focus on

                                                            
                                                            
                                                               .
                                                            
                                                   2     4  
                                                            

We find the pivot, then divide that row by 2:

                  1    1  1        1                                 1  1  1  1  
                                                                                 
                  0    1  0        3                                 0  1  0  3    .
                                                                                 
                    0  0  2        4                                 0  0  1  2  
                                                                                 

The matrix is now in row echelon form.
    The equation corresponding to the last row is 3 = 2. We know 3 and we could

substitute it into the first two equations to get equations for 1 and 2. Then we could
do the same thing with 2, until we solve for all 3 variables. This procedure is called
backsubstitution and we can achieve it via elementary operations. We start from the lowest

pivot (leading entry in the row echelon form) and subtract the right multiple from the row

above to make all the entries above this pivot zero. Then we move to the next pivot and so

on. After we are done, we will have a matrix in reduced row echelon form.

    We continue our example. Subtract the last row from the first to get

                                        1    1     0  -1       
                                                               
                                        0    1     0     3        .

                                        0    0     1     2     
                                                               

The entry above the pivot in the second row is already zero. So we move onto the next
pivot, the one in the second row. We subtract this row from the top row to get

                                        1    0     0  -4       
                                                               
                                        0    1     0     3        .

                                        0    0     1     2     
                                                               

The matrix is in reduced row echelon form.
    If we now write down the equations for 1, 2, 3, we find

                       1 = -4, 2 = 3, 3 = 2.

In other words, we have solved the system.
412                          APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

A.3.3 Non-unique solutions and inconsistent systems

It is possible that the solution of a linear system of equations is not unique, or that no
solution exists. Suppose for a moment that the row echelon form we found was

         1  2  3  4  
                     
         0  0  1  3     .

         0  0  0  1  
                     

Then we have an equation 0 = 1 coming from the last row. That is impossible and the
equations are what we call inconsistent. There is no solution to ì = ì.

    On the other hand, if we find a row echelon form

         1  2  3  4  
                     
         0  0  1  3     ,

         0  0  0  0  
                     

then there is no issue with finding solutions. In fact, we will find way too many. Let us
continue with backsubstitution (subtracting 3 times the third row from the first) to find the
reduced row echelon form and let's mark the pivots.

         1  2  0  -5       
                           

         0  0  1     3     
                           
         0  0  0     0

The last row is all zeros; it just says 0 = 0 and we ignore it. The two remaining equations
are

                                          1 + 22 = -5, 3 = 3.

Let us solve for the variables that corresponded to the pivots, that is, 1 and 3 as there
was a pivot in the first column and in the third column:

       1 = -22 - 5,
       3 = 3.

The variable 2 can be anything you wish and we still get a solution. The 2 is called a free
variable. There are infinitely many solutions, one for every choice of 2. If we pick 2 = 0,
then 1 = -5, and 3 = 3 give a solution. But we also get a solution by picking say 2 = 1,
in which case 1 = -9 and 3 = 3, or by picking 2 = -5 in which case 1 = 5 and 3 = 3.

    The general idea is that if any row has all zeros in the columns corresponding to the
variables, but a nonzero entry in the column corresponding to the right-hand side ì, then

the system is inconsistent and has no solutions. In other words, the system is inconsistent

if you find a pivot on the right side of the vertical line drawn in the augmented matrix.
Otherwise, the system is consistent, and at least one solution exists.
A.3. ELIMINATION                                             413

    Suppose the system is consistent (at least one solution exists):

   (i) If every column corresponding to a variable has a pivot element, then the solution is
       unique.

  (ii) If there are columns corresponding to variables with no pivot, then those are free
       variables that can be chosen arbitrarily, and there are infinitely many solutions.

    When ì = 0ì, we have a so-called homogeneous matrix equation

                                                      ì = 0ì.

There is no need to write an augmented matrix in this case. As the elementary operations
do not do anything to a zero column, it always stays a zero column. Moreover, ì = 0ì
always has at least one solution, namely ì = 0ì. Such a system is always consistent. It may
have other solutions: If you find any free variables, then you get infinitely many solutions.

    The set of solutions of ì = 0ì comes up quite often so people give it a name. It is called
the nullspace or the kernel of . One place where the kernel comes up is invertibility of a
square matrix . If the kernel of  contains a nonzero vector, then it contains infinitely
many vectors (there was a free variable). But then it is impossible to invert 0ì, since infinitely
many vectors go to 0ì, so there is no unique vector that  takes to 0ì. So if the kernel is
nontrivial, that is, if there are any nonzero vectors in the kernel, in other words, if there are
any free variables, or in yet other words, if the row echelon form of  has columns without
pivots, then  is not invertible. We will return to this idea later.

A.3.4 Linear independence and rank

If rows of a matrix correspond to equations, it may be good to find out how many equations

we really need to find the same set of solutions. Similarly, if we find a number of solutions
to a linear equation ì = 0ì, we may ask if we found enough so that all other solutions can

be formed out of the given set. The concept we want is that of linear independence. That

same concept is useful for differential equations, for example in chapter 2.
    Given row or column vectors ì1, ì2, . . . , ì, a linear combination is an expression of the

form

                  1ì1 + 2ì2 + · · · +  ì ,

where 1, 2, . . . ,  are all scalars. For example, 3ì1 + ì2 - 5ì3 is a linear combination of
ì1, ì2, and ì3.

We have seen linear combinations before. The expression

                                          ì

is a linear combination of the columns of , while
                                                  ì  = ( ì)

is a linear combination of the rows of .
414                                                              APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

    The way linear combinations come up in our study of differential equations is similar to
the following computation. Suppose that ì1, ì2, . . . , ì are solutions to ì1 = 0ì, ì2 = 0ì,
. . . , ì = 0ì. Then the linear combination

                                        ì = 1ì1 + 2ì2 + · · · +  ì

is a solution to ì = 0ì:

ì = (1ì1 + 2ì2 + · · · +  ì) =
                                 = 1ì1 + 2ì2 + · · · +  ì = 10ì + 20ì + · · · + 0ì = 0ì.

    So if you have found enough solutions, you have them all. The question is, when did

we find enough of them?
    We say the vectors ì1, ì2, . . . , ì are linearly independent if the only solution to

                             1ì1 + 2ì2 + · · · +  ì = 0ì

is 1 = 2 = · · · =  = 0. Otherwise, we say the vectors are linearly dependent.

For example, the vectors  1     and   0     are linearly independent. Let's try:
                          2           1

                          1           0              1             ì0
                       1 + 2 =                                   =0= .
                          2           1 21 + 2                           0

So 1 = 0, and then it is clear that 2 = 0 as well. In other words, the two vectors are

linearly independent.

If a set of vectors is linearly dependent, that is, some of the s are nonzero, then we can

solve for one vector in terms of the others. Suppose 1  0. Since 1ì1+2ì2+· · ·+ ì = 0ì,

then                   ì1 = -2  ì 1 2 - -3  ì 1 3 + · · · + -  ì . 1

For example,                    1 1  1  0

                                    
                             2  2  -  4  1     +  2     0     =    0  ,
                                                                   
                                3 1 -1 0
                                    

and so                             1 1  1 

                                      
                                   2     =  2  1     -     0    .
                                                              
                                   3 1 -1
                                      

You may have noticed that solving for those s is just solving linear equations, and so

you may not be surprised that to check if a set of vectors is linearly independent we use

row reduction.

Given a set of vectors, we may not be interested in just finding if they are linearly

independent or not, we may be interested in finding a linearly independent subset. Or
A.3. ELIMINATION                                                                415

perhaps we may want to find some other vectors that give the same linear combinations
and are linearly independent. The way to figure this out is to form a matrix out of our
vectors. If we have row vectors we consider them as rows of a matrix. If we have column
vectors we consider them columns of a matrix. The set of all linear combinations of a set of
vectors is called their span.

span ì1, ì2, . . . , ì = Set of all linear combinations of ì1, ì2, . . . , ì .

    Given a matrix , the maximal number of linearly independent rows is called the rank
of , and we write "rank " for the rank. For example,

                          1  1  1  
                                   
                  rank    2  2  2    =  1.

                        -1 -1 -1

The second and third row are multiples of the first one. We cannot choose more than one
row and still have a linearly independent set. But what is

                        1 2 3      =?
                  rank 4 5 6

                        7 8 9

That seems to be a tougher question to answer. The first two rows are linearly independent

(neither is a multiple of the other), so the rank is at least two. If we would set up the

equations for the 1, 2, and 3, we would find a system with infinitely many solutions.

One solution is

                  1 2 3 -2 4 5 6 + 7 8 9 = 0 0 0 .

So the set of all three rows is linearly dependent, the rank cannot be 3. Therefore the rank
is 2.

    But how can we do this in a more systematic way? We find the row echelon form!

                             1 2 3          1 2 3
                 Row echelon form of 4 5 6 is 0 1 2 .
                             7 8 9          0 0 0

The elementary row operations do not change the set of linear combinations of the rows

(that was one of the main reasons for defining them as they were). In other words, the
span of the rows of the  is the same as the span of the rows of the row echelon form of
. In particular, the number of linearly independent rows is the same. And in the row

echelon form, all nonzero rows are linearly independent. This is not hard to see. Consider
the two nonzero rows in the example above. Suppose we tried to solve for the 1 and 2 in

                  1 1 2 3 + 2 0 1 2 = 0 0 0 .

Since the first column of the row echelon matrix has zeros except in the first row, it follows
that 1 = 0. Using that 1 = 0 and looking at the second column, we find 2 = 0. We only
have two nonzero rows, and they are linearly independent, so the rank of the matrix is 2.
416                                                             APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

    The span of the rows is called the row space. The row space of  and the row echelon
form of  are the same. In the example,

                      1 2 3                        1 2 3,4 5 6,7 8 9
     row space of 4 5 6 = span                     1 2 3,0 1 2 .

                      7 8 9
                                    = span

Similarly to row space, the span of columns is called the column space.

                                      1 2 3                    1       2     3 
                                                                       
          column space of 4 5 6 7 8 9 =  span    47 ,   58 ,   69 .  
                                                                   

    So it may also be good to find the number of linearly independent columns of . One
way to do that is to find the number of linearly independent rows of . It is a tremendously
useful fact that the number of linearly independent columns is always the same as the
number of linearly independent rows:

Theorem A.3.1. rank  = rank 

In particular, to find a set of linearly independent columns we need to look at where

the pivots were. If you recall above, when solving ì = 0ì the key was finding the pivots,

any non-pivot columns corresponded to free variables. That means we can solve for the

non-pivot columns in terms of the pivot columns. Let's see an example. First we reduce

some random matrix:                      1 2 3 4
                                         2 4 5 6 .
                                         3 6 7 8

We find a pivot and reduce the rows below:

          1          2 3 4            1    2  3       4           1    2  3     4  
                            6                      -2                  0 -1 -2 .   
          2          4  5             0    0  -1                  0

          3          6 7 8            3    6  7       8           0    0 -2 -4
                                                                

We find the next pivot, make it one, and rinse and repeat:

       1     2          3      4           1  2    3       4           1  2  3     4
                            -2                                                     2 .
                        -1                                           
       0     0                             0  0    1       2           0  0  1
                            -4                0 -2 -4                              0
       0     0          -2                 0                           0  0  0

The final matrix is the row echelon form of the matrix. Consider the pivots that we marked.
The pivot columns are the first and the third column. All other columns correspond to free
A.3. ELIMINATION                                                                              417

variables when solving ì = 0ì, so all other columns can be solved in terms of the first and
the third column. In other words

                  1 2 3 4                      1 2 3 4                      1 3 
                                                       
column space of 2 4 5 6 3 6 7 8 =  span    23 ,   46 ,   57 ,   68 =   span    23 ,   57 .  
                                                                              

We could perhaps use another pair of columns to get the same span, but the first and the
third are guaranteed to work because they are pivot columns.

    The discussion above could be expanded into a proof of the theorem if we wanted. As
each nonzero row in the row echelon form contains a pivot, then the rank is the number of
pivots, which is the same as the maximal number of linearly independent columns.

    The idea also works in reverse. Suppose we have a bunch of column vectors and we just
need to find a linearly independent set. For example, suppose we started with the vectors

                         1                 2            3            4
                                                                     
                  ì1  =  2  ,       ì2  =  4  ,  ì3  =  5  ,  ì4  =  6  .
                                                                     
                         3                 6            7            8
                                                                     

These vectors are not linearly independent as we saw above. In particular, the span of ì1
and ì3 is the same as the span of all four of the vectors. So ì2 and ì4 can both be written as
linear combinations of ì1 and ì3. A common thing that comes up in practice is that one

gets a set of vectors whose span is the set of solutions of some problem. But perhaps we

get way too many vectors, we want to simplify. For example above, all vectors in the span

of ì1, ì2, ì3, ì4 can be written 1ì1 + 2ì2 + 3ì3 + 4ì4 for some numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.
But it is also true that every such vector can be written as ì1 + ì3 for two numbers  and
. And one has to admit, that looks much simpler. Moreover, these numbers  and  are

unique. More on that in the next section.

To find this linearly independent set we simply take our vectors and form the matrix

[ì1 ì2 ì3 ì4], that is, the matrix      1 2 3 4
                                        2 4 5 6 .
                                        3 6 7 8

We crank up the row-reduction machine, feed this matrix into it, find the pivot columns,
and pick those. In this case, ì1 and ì3.

A.3.5 Computing the inverse

If the matrix  is square and there exists a unique solution ì to ì = ì for any ì (there are
no free variables), then  is invertible. This is equivalent to the  ×  matrix  being of
rank .

    In particular, if ì = ì then ì = -1ì. Now we just need to compute what -1 is. We
can surely do elimination every time we want to find -1ì, but that would be ridiculous.
418                                                    APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

The mapping -1 is linear and hence given by a matrix, and we have seen that to figure out
the matrix we just need to find where -1 takes the standard basis vectors ì1, ì2, . . . , ì.

    That is, to find the first column of -1, we solve ì = ì1, because then -1ì1 = ì. To
find the second column of -1, we solve ì = ì2. And so on. It is really just  eliminations

that we need to do. But it gets even easier. If you think about it, the elimination is the same
for everything on the left side of the augmented matrix. Doing  eliminations separately

we would redo most of the computations. Best is to do all at once.

    Therefore, to find the inverse of , we write an  × 2 augmented matrix [  |  ], where
 is the identity matrix, whose columns are precisely the standard basis vectors. We then
perform row reduction until we arrive at the reduced row echelon form. If  is invertible,
then pivots can be found in every column of , and so the reduced row echelon form of
[  |  ] looks like [  | -1 ]. We then just read off the inverse -1. If you do not find a pivot
in every one of the first  columns of the augmented matrix, then  is not invertible.

    This is best seen by example. Suppose we wish to invert the matrix

                                                  1 2 3
                                                  2 0 1 .
                                                  3 1 0
We write the augmented matrix and we start reducing:

                             2 0 1 =  3/11 -9/11 5/11  .
                             3 1 0              2/11 5/11 -4/11

                                                               

Not too terrible, no? Perhaps harder than inverting a 2 × 2 matrix for which we had a
simple formula, but not too bad. Really in practice this is done efficiently by a computer.

A.4 Subspaces, dimension, and the kernel

Note: 1 lecture

A.4.1 Subspaces, basis, and dimension

We often find ourselves looking at the set of solutions of a linear equation ì = 0ì for some
matrix , that is, we are interested in the kernel of . The set of all such solutions has a nice
structure: It looks and acts a lot like some euclidean space .

    We say that a set  of vectors in  is a subspace if whenever ì and ì are members of 
and  is a scalar, then

                                            ì + ì, and ì

are also members of . That is, we can add and multiply by scalars and we still land in .
So every linear combination of vectors of  is still in . That is really what a subspace is.
It is a subset where we can take linear combinations and still end up being in the subset.
Consequently the span of a number of vectors is automatically a subspace.

Example A.4.1:

   (i) If we let  = , then this  is a subspace of . Adding any two vectors in  gets a
       vector in , and so does multiplying by scalars.

  (ii) The set  = {0ì}, that is, the set of the zero vector by itself, is also a subspace of .
       There is only one vector in this subspace, so we only need to verify the definition for
       that one vector, and everything checks out: 0ì + 0ì = 0ì and 0ì = 0ì.

 (iii) The set  of all the vectors of the form (, ) for any real number , such as (1, 1), (3, 3),
       or (-0.5, -0.5) is a subspace of 2. Adding two such vectors, say (1, 1) + (3, 3) = (4, 4)
       again gets a vector of the same form, and so does multiplying by a scalar, say
       8(1, 1) = (8, 8).

    If  is a subspace and we can find  linearly independent vectors in 

                                                  ì1, ì2, . . . , ì ,

such that every other vector in  is a linear combination of ì1, ì2, . . . , ì, then the set
{ì1, ì2, . . . , ì} is called a basis of . In other words,  is the span of {ì1, ì2, . . . , ì} and
there is no smaller subset of these vectors that spans . We say that  has dimension ,
and we write

                                                    dim  = .

We have the following theorem.
422                                          APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

Theorem A.4.1. If    is a subspace and  is not the trivial subspace {0ì}, then there exists a

unique positive integer  (the dimension) and a (not unique) basis {ì1, ì2, . . . , ì}, such that every
ì in  can be uniquely represented by

                        ì = 1ì1 + 2ì2 + · · · + ì ,

for some scalars 1, 2, . . . , . By "uniquely represented" we mean that these scalars 1, 2, . . . ,
 are unique.

    Just as a vector in  is represented by a -tuple of numbers, so is a vector in a
-dimensional subspace of  represented by a unique -tuple of numbers. At least once
we have fixed a basis. A different basis would give a different -tuple of numbers for the
same vector.

    We should reiterate that while  is unique (a subspace cannot have two different
dimensions--every basis has the same number of vectors), the set of basis vectors is not at
all unique. There are lots of different bases for any given subspace. Finding just the right
basis for a subspace is a large part of what one does in linear algebra. In fact, that is what
we spend a lot of time on in linear differential equations, although at first glance it may not
seem like that is what we are doing.

Example A.4.2:

(i) The standard basis

                        ì1, ì2, . . . , ì ,

     is a basis of , (hence the name). So as expected

                        dim  = .

  (ii) Both sets (1, 0), (0, 1) and (1, 1), (1, -1) are bases of 2. A vector (3, 7) can be
       written as (3, 7) = 3(1, 0) + 7(0, 1) (and in no other way with the first basis), and it can
       be written as (3, 7) = 5(1, 1) - 2(1, -1) (and in no other way with the second basis).

 (iii) The subspace {0ì} is of dimension 0. A basis is simply an empty set of vectors.

 (iv) The subspace  from Example A.4.1, that is, the set of vectors (, ), is of dimension 1.
       One possible basis is simply (1, 1) , the single vector (1, 1): Every vector in  can be
       represented by (1, 1) = (, ). Similarly another possible basis would be (-1, -1) .
       Then the vector (, ) would be represented as (-)(1, 1).

  (v) The set (1, 1), (-1, -1) does span , but it is not a basis as it is not a linearly
       independent set. Consequently, a vector such as (2, 2) can be written in multiple ways
       with this set of vectors: (2, 2) = 2(1, 1) + 0(-1, -1), or (2, 2) = 5(1, 1) + 3(-1, -1), etc.

    Row and column spaces of a matrix are also examples of subspaces, as they are given
as the span of vectors. We can use what we know about rank, row spaces, and column
spaces from the previous section to find a basis.
A.4. SUBSPACES, DIMENSION, AND THE KERNEL                               423

Example A.4.3: In the last section, we considered the matrix

                  1 2 3 4
              = 2 4 5 6 .

                  3 6 7 8

Using row reduction to find the pivot columns, we found

                                    1 2 3 4                      1 3 
             column space of  2 4 5 6 3 6 7 8 =  span    23 ,   57 .  
                                                                   

What we did was we found a basis of the column space. This basis has two elements, and
so the column space of  is two-dimensional. Notice that the rank of  is two.

We would have followed the same procedure if we wanted to find a basis of the subspace

 spanned by  1 2 3 4

                
             2                        ,  4  ,  5  ,  6    .
                                                     
             3 6 7 8
                

We would have simply formed the matrix  with these vectors as columns and repeated

the computation above. The subspace  is then the column space of .

Example A.4.4: Consider the matrix

                  1 2 0 0 3
              = 0 0 1 0 4 .

                  0 0 0 1 5

Conveniently, the matrix is in reduced row echelon form. The matrix is of rank 3. The
column space is the span of the pivot columns. It is the 3-dimensional space

                                                1 0 0 
                                                       3
             column space of  = span              0    ,  1  ,  0  = .
                                                                
                                                0 0 1 
                                                    

The row space is the 3-dimensional space

row space of  = span 1 2 0 0 3 , 0 0 1 0 4 , 0 0 0 1 5 .

As these vectors have 5 components, we think of the row space of  as a subspace of 5.

    The way the dimensions worked out in the examples is not an accident. Since the
number of vectors that we needed to take was always the same as the number of pivots,
and the number of pivots is the rank, we get the following result.

Theorem A.4.2 (Rank). The dimension of the column space and the dimension of the row space of
a matrix  are both equal to the rank of .
424                                               APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

A.4.2 Kernel

The set of solutions of a linear equation ì = 0ì, the kernel of , is a subspace: If ì and ì
are solutions, then

              (ì + ì) = ì + ì = 0ì + 0ì = 0ì, and (ì) = ì = 0ì = 0ì.

So ì + ì and ì are solutions. The dimension of the kernel is called the nullity of the
matrix.

    The same sort of idea governs the solutions of linear differential equations. We try to
describe the kernel of a linear differential operator, and as it is a subspace, we look for a
basis of this kernel. Much of this book is dedicated to finding such bases.

    The kernel of a matrix is the same as the kernel of its reduced row echelon form. For
a matrix in reduced row echelon form, the kernel is rather easy to find. If a vector ì is
applied to a matrix , then each entry in ì corresponds to a column of , the column that
the entry multiplies. To find the kernel, pick a non-pivot column make a vector that has a
-1 in the entry corresponding to this non-pivot column and zeros at all the other entries
corresponding to the other non-pivot columns. Then for all the entries corresponding
to pivot columns make it precisely the value in the corresponding row of the non-pivot
column to make the vector be a solution to ì = 0ì. This procedure is best understood by
example.

Example A.4.5: Consider

                              1    2     0     0  3
                                                   
                           =    0  0     1     0 4 .
                              
                                               1 5
                                0  0     0

This matrix is in reduced row echelon form, the pivots are marked. There are two non-pivot

columns, so the kernel has dimension 2, that is, it is the span of 2 vectors. Let us find the

first vector. We look at the first non-pivot column, the 2nd column, and we put a -1 in the

2nd entry of our vector. We put a 0 in the 5th entry as the 5th column is also a non-pivot

column:

                                   ?
                                   
                                   -1
                                      ?     .
                                         
                                   ?
                                   
                                   0
                                   

Let us fill the rest. When this vector hits the first row of , we get a -2 and 1 times whatever
the first question mark is. We want to get zero when hitting the first row, so make the first
question mark 2. To get zero when hitting the second and third rows, it is sufficient to
make the remaining question marks 0. We are really filling in the non-pivot column into
A.4. SUBSPACES, DIMENSION, AND THE KERNEL                                    425

the remaining entries. Let us check while marking which numbers went where:

                                              2
                                              
                       1  2     0     0  3 -1            0
                                                         
                       0  0     1     0  4      0     =  0    .
                                                         
                       0                 5               0
                          0     0     1         0        
                                                   
                                                0

Yay! How about the second vector. We start with

                                      ?
                                      
                                      0
                                      
                                      ?
                                      
                                      ?
                                      
                                      -1.

We set the first question mark to 3, the second to 4, and the third to 5. Let us check, marking

things as previously,

                                              3
                                              
                       1  2  0     0     3   0  0
                                               
                       0 0 1 0           4      4     =  0    .
                                                         
                       0 0 0 1                           0
                                         5      5        
                                              -1

There are two non-pivot columns, so we only need two vectors. We have found a basis of

the kernel. So,                                                  
                                                              
                                                   2       3
                                               -1  0  
                                                   
                       kernel of  = span     0  0  ,    4  5  
                                                   
                                                0  -1 
                                                 

What we did in finding a basis of the kernel is that we expressed all solutions of ì = 0ì

as a linear combination of some given vectors.
    The procedure to find a basis of the kernel of a matrix :

(i) Find the reduced row echelon form of .

(ii) Write down a basis of the kernel as above, one vector for each non-pivot column.

    The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the column space, and that is the span on the
pivot columns, while the kernel is the span of vectors one for each non-pivot column. So
the two numbers must add to the number of columns.

Theorem A.4.3 (Rank-Nullity). If a matrix  has  columns, rank , and nullity  (dimension
of the kernel), then

                                                      =  + .
426                                                   APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

    The theorem is immensely useful in applications. It allows one to compute the rank
 if one knows the nullity  and vice versa, without doing any extra work. An example
application is a simple version of the so-called Fredholm alternative. A similar result is true
for differential equations. Consider

                                                      ì = ì,

where  is a square  ×  matrix. There are then two mutually exclusive possibilities:

   (i) A nonzero solution ì to ì = 0ì exists.

  (ii) The equation ì = ì has a unique solution ì for every ì.

How does the Rank-Nullity theorem come into the picture? Well, if  has a nonzero
solution ì to ì = 0ì, then the nullity  is positive. But then the rank  =  -  must be
less than . It means that the column space of  is of dimension less than , so it is a
subspace that does not include everything in . So  has to contain some vector ì not in
the column space of . In fact, most vectors in  are not in the column space of .

A.5 Inner product and projections

Note: 1-2 lectures

A.5.1 Inner product and orthogonality

To do basic geometry, we need length, and we need angles. We have already seen the
euclidean length, so let us figure out angles. Mostly, we are worried about the right angle.

    Given two (column) vectors in , we define the (standard) inner product as the dot
product:

                                                                                                                        

                     ì, ì = ì · ì = ì ì = 11 + 22 + · · · +   =  .

                                                                                                                      =1

Why do we seemingly give a new notation for the dot product (ì, ì instead of just ì · ì)?
Because there are other possible inner products, which are not the dot product, although
we will not worry about others here. An inner product can even be defined on spaces of
functions as we do in chapter 4:

                                                       
                                          (), () =  ()() .

                                                                                  

But we digress.
    The inner product satisfies the following rules:

   (i) ì, ì  0, and ì, ì = 0 if and only if ì = 0,

  (ii) ì, ì = ì, ì,

 (iii) ì, ì = ì, ì = ì, ì,

 (iv) ì + ì, ì = ì, ì + ì, ì and ì, ì + ì = ì, ì + ì, ì.

Anything that satisfies the properties above can be called an inner product, although in
this section we are concerned with the standard inner product in .

    The standard inner product gives the euclidean length:

                      ì =  ì, ì =  2    +  2    +  ·  ·  ·  +  2  .

                                     1       2

How does it give angles? You may recall a formula for the standard inner product (the dot

product) from multivariable calculus in two or three dimensions in terms of the angle 

between the vectors:

                           ì, ì = ìì cos .

That is,  is the angle that ì and ì make when they are based at the same point.

When Euclid defined angles in his Elements, the only angle he ever really defined was the right angle.
A.5. INNER PRODUCT AND PROJECTIONS                    429

    In  (any dimension), we are simply going to say that  from the formula is what the
angle is. This makes sense as any two vectors based at the origin lie in a 2-dimensional
plane (subspace), and the formula works in 2 dimensions. In fact, one could even talk
about angles between functions this way, and we do in chapter 4, where we talk about
orthogonal functions (functions at right angle to each other).

    To compute the angle we compute

                                                            ì, ì
                                                cos  = ìì .

Our angles are always in radians. We are computing the cosine of the angle, which is really

the best we can do. Given two vectors at an angle , we can give the angle as -, 2 - ,

etc., see Figure A.5. Fortunately, cos  = cos(-) = cos(2 - ). If we solve for  using the
inverse cosine cos-1, we can just decree that 0    .

                          2 -        ì

                                          
                                    -

                                             ì

                  Figure A.5: Angle between vectors.

Example A.5.1: Let us compute the angle between the vectors (3, 0) and (1, 1) in the plane.

Compute

                          (3, 0), (1, 1) 3 + 0 1
                  cos  =            =  = .
                          (3, 0)(1, 1) 3 2 2

Therefore  = /4.

    As we said, the most important angle is the right angle. A right angle is /2 radians,
and cos(/2) = 0, so the formula is particularly easy in this case. We say vectors ì and ì are

orthogonal if they are at right angles, that is, if

                          ì, ì = 0.

The vectors (1, 0, 0, 1) and (1, 2, 3, -1) are orthogonal. So are (1, 1) and (1, -1). However,
(1, 1) and (1, 2) are not orthogonal as their inner product is 3 and not 0.

A.5.2 Orthogonal projection

A typical application of linear algebra is to take a difficult problem, write everything in
the right basis, and in this new basis the problem becomes simple. A particularly useful
430                                                       APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

basis is an orthogonal basis, a basis where all the basis vectors are orthogonal. When we
draw a coordinate system in two or three dimensions, we almost always draw our axes as
orthogonal to each other.

    Generalizing this concept to functions, it is particularly useful in chapter 4 to express a
function using a particular orthogonal basis, the Fourier series.

    To express one vector in terms of an orthogonal basis, we need to first project one vector
onto another. Given a nonzero vector ì, we define the orthogonal projection of ì onto ì as

                                                             ì , ì
                                            projì(  ì ) = ì, ì ì.

For the geometric idea, see Figure A.6. That is, we find the "shadow of ì " on the line
spanned by ì if the direction of the sun's rays were exactly perpendicular to the line.
Another way of thinking about it is that the tip of the arrow of projì(ì ) is the closest point
on the line spanned by ì to the tip of the arrow of ì . In terms of euclidean distance,
ì = projì(ì ) minimizes the distance ì - ì among all vectors ì that are multiples of
ì. Because of this, this projection comes up often in applied mathematics in all sorts of
contexts we cannot solve a problem exactly: We cannot always solve "Find ì as a multiple
of ì," but projì(ì ) is the best "solution."

                                                 ì

                                                
                                             projì(ì ) ì

                                    Figure A.6: Orthogonal projection.

     The formula follows from basic trigonometry. The length of projì(ì ) should be cos 

times the length of ì , that is, (cos )ì . We take the unit vector in the direction of ì, that

is,   ì  and  we  multiply  it  by  the  length  of  the  projection.  In  other  words,
     ì

                  projì(ì ) = (cos )ì  ì ì = ì2 (cos )ì ì ì = ì , ì ì, ì ì.

Example A.5.2: Suppose we wish to project the vector (3, 2, 1) onto the vector (1, 2, 3).
Compute

         proj(1,2,3) (3, 2, 1)  = (3, 2, 1), (1, 2, 3) ( ( 1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3) 1, 2, 3) = 3 · 1 + 2 · 2 + 1 · 3 1 · 1 + 2 · 2 + 3 · 3 (1, 2, 3)

                                                          = 10 (1, 2, 3) = 5 , 10 , 15 .
                                                          14                      77 7

    Let us double check that the projection is orthogonal. That is ì - projì(ì ) ought to be
orthogonal to ì, see the right angle in Figure A.6 on the preceding page. That is,

       (3, 2, 1) - proj(1,2,3) (3, 2, 1) = 3 - 57 , 2 - 107 , 1 - 157 = 167 , 47 , -87

ought to be orthogonal to (1, 2, 3). We compute the inner product and we had better get

zero:  16 , 4 , -8 , (1, 2, 3) = 16 · 1 + 4 · 2 - 8 · 3 = 0.

A.5.3 Orthogonal basis

As we said, a basis ì1, ì2, . . . , ì is an orthogonal basis if all vectors in the basis are orthogonal

to each other, that is, if

                                    ì , ì = 0

for all choices of  and  where    (a nonzero vector cannot be orthogonal to itself).

A basis is furthermore called an orthonormal basis if all the vectors in a basis are also

unit vectors, that is, if all the vectors have magnitude 1. For example, the standard basis
{(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} is an orthonormal basis of 3: Any pair is orthogonal, and each

vector is of unit magnitude.

The reason why we are interested in orthogonal (or orthonormal) bases is that they

make it really simple to represent a vector (or a projection onto a subspace) in the basis. The

formula for the orthogonal projection onto a vector gives us the coefficients. In chapter 4,

we use the same idea by finding the correct orthogonal basis for the set of solutions of a

differential equation. We are then able to find any particular solution by simply applying

the orthogonal projection formula, which is just a couple of a inner products.
    Let us come back to linear algebra. Consider a subspace  and an orthogonal basis

ì1, ì2, . . . , ì for . We wish to express some vector ì in terms of this basis. If ì is not in
the span of this basis (when it is not in ), then of course it is not possible, but the following
formula gives us at least the orthogonal projection onto the subspace , or in other words,
the best approximation to ì in the subspace--the vector in  closest to ì.

    First suppose that ì is in the span. Then it is the sum of the orthogonal projections:

ì = projì1(ì) + projì2(ì) + · · · + projì (ì) = ì, ì1 ì ì1 + ì, ì2 ì2 + · · · + ì, ì ì. 1, ì1 ì2, ì2 ì , ì

In other words, if we want to write ì = 1ì1 + 2ì2 + · · · + ì, then

       1 = ì, ì1 , 2 = ì, ì2 , . . . ,  = ì, ì .
                            ì1, ì1  ì2, ì2           ì , ì

    Another way to derive this formula is to work in reverse. Suppose that ì = 1ì1 + 2ì2 +
· · · + ì. Take an inner product with ì, and use the properties of the inner product:

       ì, ì = 1ì1 + 2ì2 + · · · + ì , ì
                = 1ì1, ì + 2ì2, ì + · · · + ì , ì.
432                                                   APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

As the basis is orthogonal, then ì , ì = 0 whenever   . That means that only one of
the terms, the th one, on the right-hand side is nonzero and we get

                                ì, ì = ì , ì.

Solving for  we find  = ì ,ì  ì,ì as before.

                                                                      

Example A.5.3: The vectors (1, 1) and (1, -1) form an orthogonal basis of 2. Suppose we
wish to represent (3, 4) in terms of this basis, that is, we wish to find 1 and 2 such that

                                         (3, 4) = 1(1, 1) + 2(1, -1).

We compute:

             1 = (3, 4), (1, 1) (1, 1), (1, 1) = 72 , 2 = (3, 4), (1, -1) (1, -1), (1, -1) = -12 .

So                 (3, 4) = 7(1, 1) + -1(1, -1).

                                2                  2

    If the basis is orthonormal rather than orthogonal, then all the denominators are one. It

is easy to make a basis orthonormal--divide all the vectors by their size. If you want to

decompose many vectors, it may be better to find an orthonormal basis. In the example

above, the orthonormal basis we would thus create is

                                              11    1 -1
                                             , ,    , .

                                               22    22

Then the computation would have been

                           11    11                   (3, 4),   1 -1   1 -1
     (3, 4) = (3, 4),  ,         , +                            ,      ,

                            22    22                             22     22

                 7 1 1 -1 1 -1
             =  , +  , .

             2 22               2 22

    Maybe the example is not so awe inspiring, but given vectors in 20 rather than 2,

then surely one would much rather do 20 inner products (or 40 if we did not have an

orthonormal basis) rather than solving a system of twenty equations in twenty unknowns

using row reduction of a 20 × 21 matrix.
    As we said above, the formula still works even if ì is not in the subspace, although

then it does not get us the vector ì but its projection. More concretely, suppose that  is a
subspace that is the span of ì1, ì2, . . . , ì and ì is any vector. Let proj(ì) be the vector in
 that is the closest to ì. Then

             proj(ì) = ì, ì1 ì1 + ì, ì2 ì2 + · · · + ì, ì ì.
             ì1, ì1 ì2, ì2                                     ì , ì
A.5. INNER PRODUCT AND PROJECTIONS                                                                                                   433

    Of course, if ì is in , then proj(ì) = ì, as the closest vector in  to ì is ì itself. But
true utility is obtained when ì is not in . In much of applied mathematics, we cannot find
an exact solution to a problem, but we try to find the best solution out of a small subset
(subspace). The partial sums of Fourier series from chapter 4 are one example. Another
example is least square approximation to fit a curve to data. Yet another example is given
by the most commonly used numerical methods to solve partial differential equations, the
finite element methods.

Example A.5.4: The vectors (1, 2, 3) and (3, 0, -1) are orthogonal, and so they are an
orthogonal basis of a subspace :

                    = span (1, 2, 3), (3, 0, -1) .

Let us find the vector in  that is closest to (2, 1, 0). That is, let us find proj (2, 1, 0) .

proj (2, 1, 0)  = (2, 1, 0), (1, 2, 3) ( ( 1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3) 1, 2, 3) + (2, 1, 0), (3, 0, -1) ( ( 3, 0, -1), (3, 0, -1) 3, 0, -1)

                = 2(1, 2, 3) + 3(3, 0, -1)

A.5.4 The Gram-Schmidt process

Before leaving orthogonal bases, let us note a procedure for manufacturing them out of any
old basis. It may not be difficult to come up with an orthogonal basis for a 2-dimensional
subspace, but for a 20-dimensional subspace, it seems a daunting task. Fortunately, the
orthogonal projection can be used to "project away" the bits of the vectors that are making
them not orthogonal. It is called the Gram-Schmidt process.

    We start with a basis of vectors ì1, ì2, . . . , ì. We construct an orthogonal basis
ì1, ì2, . . . , ì  as follows.

                        ì1 = ì1,
                        ì2 = ì2 - projì1(ì2),
                        ì3 = ì3 - projì1(ì3) - projì2(ì3),
                        ì4 = ì4 - projì1(ì4) - projì2(ì4) - projì3(ì4),

                           ..
                           .

                        ì  = ì - projì1(ì) - projì2(ì) - · · · - projì-1(ì).

What we do is at the th step, we take ì and we subtract the projection of ì to the subspace
spanned by ì1, ì2, . . . , ì -1.

Example A.5.5: Consider the vectors (1, 2, -1), and (0, 5, -2) and call  the span of the two
vectors. Let us find an orthogonal basis of  via the Gram-Schmidt process:

    ì1 = (1, 2, -1),
    ì2 = (0, 5, -2) - proj(1,2,-1) (0, 5, -2)

         = (0, 5, -2) - (0, 5, -2), (1, 2, -1) ( ( 1, 2, -1), (1, 2, -1) 1, 2, -1) = (0, 5, -2) - 2(1, 2, -1) = (-2, 1, 0).

So (1, 2, -1) and (-2, 1, 0) span  and are orthogonal. Let us check: (1, 2, -1), (-2, 1, 0) = 0.
    Suppose we wish to find an orthonormal basis, not just an orthogonal one. Well, we

simply make the vectors into unit vectors by dividing them by their magnitude. The two
vectors making up the orthonormal basis of  are:

          1         1 2 -1                       1                       -2 1
           (1, 2, -1) =  ,  ,  ,                  (-2, 1, 0) =  ,  , 0 .

A.6 Determinant

Note: 1 lecture

    For square matrices we define a useful quantity called the determinant. Define the
determinant of a 1 × 1 matrix as the value of its only entry

                                                  def

                                 det  = .

For a 2 × 2 matrix, define         def

                            det    =  - .

    Before defining the determinant for larger matrices, we note the meaning of the
determinant. An  ×  matrix gives a mapping of the -dimensional euclidean space 
to itself. So a 2 × 2 matrix  is a mapping of the plane to itself. The determinant of  is the

factor by which the area of objects changes. If we take the unit square (square of side 1) in
the plane, then  takes the square to a parallelogram of area |det()|. The sign of det()

denotes a change of orientation (negative if the axes get flipped). For example, let

                                                  = 1 1 .
                                                         -1 1

Then det() = 1 + 1 = 2. Let us see where  sends the unit square--the square with
vertices (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1). The point (0, 0) gets sent to (0, 0).

      1 1 1= 1 ,                  1 1 0=1,              1 1 1=2.
     -1 1 0 -1                   -1 1 1 1              -1 1 1 0

The image of the square is anothersquare with vertices (0, 0), (1, -1), (1, 1), and (2, 0). The
image square has a side of length 2, and it is therefore of area 2. See Figure A.7.

    In general, the image of a square is going to be a parallelogram. In high school geometry,
you may have seen a formula for computing the area of a parallelogram with vertices (0, 0),
A.6. DETERMINANT                                                                         437

                                          det  

The vertical lines above mean absolute value. The matrix             carries the unit square to
                                                                   

the given parallelogram.

    There are a number of ways to define the determinant for an  ×  matrix. Let us use
the so-called cofactor expansion. We define  as the matrix  with the th row and the th

column deleted. For example, if

                   1 2 3
If  = 4 5 6 7 8 9 , then 12 = 4 6 7 9                              and 23 = 1 2 7 8 .
                          

We now define the determinant recursively

                                             

                                        def      (-1)1+ 1 det(1),

                            det() =

                                             =1

or in other words

det() = 11 det(11) - 12 det(12) + 13 det(13) - · · ·               +1 det(1)    if  is odd,
                                                                   -1 det(1)    if  even.

For a 3 × 3 matrix, we get det() = 11 det(11) - 12 det(12) + 13 det(13). For example,

1 2 3 5 6 4 6 4 5
det 4 5 6 = 1 · det         89                      - 2 · det  79  + 3 · det    78
                     
7 8 9

                          = 1(5 · 9 - 6 · 8) - 2(4 · 9 - 6 · 7) + 3(4 · 8 - 5 · 7) = 0.

It turns out that we did not have to necessarily use the first row. That is for any ,

                                                                 

                                  det() = (-1)+  det().

                                                                =1

It is sometimes useful to use a row other than the first. In the following example it is more
convenient to expand along the second row. Notice that for the second row we are starting
with a negative sign.

1 2 3                                        23     + 5 · det  13    - 0 · det  12
det 0 5 0 = -0 · det
7 8 9                                        89                79               78

                          = 0 + 5(1 · 9 - 3 · 7) + 0 = -60.
438                                                 APPENDIX A. LINEAR ALGEBRA

Let us check if it is really the same as expanding along the first row,

     1 2 3 5 0 0 0 0 5
     det 0 5 0 = 1 · det        89       - 2 · det  79  + 3 · det        78
                        
     7 8 9

                          = 1(5 · 9 - 0 · 8) - 2(0 · 9 - 0 · 7) + 3(0 · 8 - 5 · 7) = -60.

    In computing the determinant, we alternately add and subtract the determinants of the
submatrices  multiplied by  for a fixed  and all . The numbers (-1)+ det() are
called cofactors of the matrix. And that is why this method of computing the determinant
is called the cofactor expansion.

    Similarly we do not need to expand along a row, we can expand along a column. For
any ,

                                                                       

                                      det() = (-1)+  det().

                                                                      =1

A related fact is that

                                det() = det().

A matrix is upper triangular if all elements below the main diagonal are 0. For example,

                                         1 2 3
                                         0 5 6
                                         0 0 9

is upper triangular. Similarly a lower triangular matrix is one where everything above the

diagonal is zero. For example,

                                         1 0 0
                                         4 5 0 .
                                         7 8 9

The determinant for triangular matrices is very simple to compute. Consider the lower

triangular matrix. If we expand along the first row, we find that the determinant is 1 times

the determinant of the lower triangular matrix  50  . So the determinant is just the product
                                                89

of the diagonal entries:

                                1 0 0
                          det 4 5 0 = 1 · 5 · 9 = 45.

                                7 8 9

Similarly for upper triangular matrices

                                1 2 3
                          det 0 5 6 = 1 · 5 · 9 = 45.

                                0 0 9
A.6. DETERMINANT                                                                                    439

In general, if  is triangular, then
                                            det() = 1122 · · ·  .

    If  is diagonal, then it is also triangular (upper and lower), so the same formula applies.
For example,

                                           2 0 0
                                     det 0 3 0 = 2 · 3 · 5 = 30.

                                           0 0 5
    In particular, the identity matrix  is diagonal, and the diagonal entries are all 1. Thus,

                                                    det() = 1.

    The determinant is telling you how geometric objects scale. If  doubles the sizes of
geometric objects and  triples them, then  (which applies  to an object and then it
applies ) should make size go up by a factor of 6. This is true in general:

Theorem A.6.1.

                                   det() = det() det().

    This property is one of the most useful, and it is employed often to actually compute

determinants. A particularly interesting consequence is to note what it means for the
existence of inverses. Take  and  to be inverses, that is,  = . Then

                              det() det() = det() = det() = 1.

Neither det() nor det() can be zero. This fact is an extremely useful property of the
determinant, and one which is used often in this book:
Theorem A.6.2. An  ×  matrix  is invertible if and only if det()  0.

    In fact, det(-1) det() = 1 says that

                                     det(-1) = 1 det() .

So we know what the determinant of -1 is without computing -1.
    Let us return to the formula for the inverse of a 2 × 2 matrix:

                                     -1 1                      - .
                                             =
                                                   -  - 

Notice  the  determinant  of  the  matrix  [      ]  in  the  denominator  of  the  fraction.  The  formula
                                                

only works if the determinant is nonzero, otherwise we are dividing by zero.

A common notation for the determinant is a pair of vertical lines:

                                     = det   .
                                                              

Personally, I find this notation confusing as vertical lines usually mean a positive quantity,
while determinants can be negative. Also think about how to write the absolute value of a
determinant. This notation is not used in this book.

1.2.102: Yes a solution exists. The equation is  =  (, ) where  (, ) =  . The
function  (, ) is continuous and    = , which is also continuous near (0, 0). So a
solution exists and is unique. (In fact,  = 0 is the solution.)

1.2.104: a)  = cos , b)  =  cos(), c)  = sin . Justification left to reader.

1.2.105: Picard does not apply as  is not continuous at  = 0. The equation does not
have a continuously differentiable solution. Suppose it did. Notice that (0) = 1. By
the first derivative test, () > 0 for small positive . But then for those , we have
() =  () = 0. It is not possible for  to be continous, (0) = 1 and () = 0 for
arbitrarily small positive .

simply go to one of the sinks, for example (0, 0) and it will not swing back and forth. The

friction is too high for it to oscillate, just like an overdamped mass-spring system.

8.3.102: a) Solving for the critical points we get (0, -/) and (  + ,  ). The Jacobian

matrix at (0, -/) is              + / 0           whose eigenvalues are  +  / and -. The eigenvalues
                                  -/ -

are real of opposite signs and we get a saddle. (In the application, however, we are only
looking at the positive quadrant so this critical point is irrelevant.) At ( +  ,  ) we get

                             0 - (+)
Jacobian matrix                                 . b) For the specific numbers given, the second critical point
                              +
                               -
                                                                                     
                                            3/25 1/4 0 -11/6 , which has eigenvalues 40 5± 327 . Therefore there is a
is  (  550  ,  40)  the  matrix   is
        3

spiral source; the solution spirals outwards. The solution eventually hits one of the axes,

 = 0 or  = 0, so something will die out in the forest.

8.3.103: The critical points are on the line  = 0. In the positive quadrant the  is always
positive and so the fox population always grows. The constant of motion is  =  --,
for any  this curve must hit the -axis (why?), so the trajectory will simply approach a
point on the  axis somewhere and the number of hares will go to zero.

8.4.101: Use Bendixson-Dulac Theorem. a)  +  = 1 + 1 > 0, so no closed trajectories.
b)  +  = - sin2() + 0 < 0 for all ,  except the lines given by  =  (where we get
zero), so no closed trajectories. c)  +  = 2 + 0 > 0 for all ,  except the line given by
 = 0 (where we get zero), so no closed trajectories.

8.4.102: Using Poincaré-Bendixson Theorem, the system has a limit cycle, which is the
unit circle centered at the origin, as  = cos() + -,  = sin() + - gets closer and closer
to the unit circle. Thus  = cos(),  = sin() is the periodic solution.

8.4.103:  (, ) = , (, ) = (1 - 2) - . So  +  = (1 - 2). The Bendixson-Dulac
Theorem says there is no closed trajectory lying entirely in the set 2 < 1.

8.4.104: The closed trajectories are those where sin() = 0, therefore, all the circles centered

at the origin with radius that is a multiple of  are closed trajectories.
