Preface
This module contains the preface for Fundamentals of Mathematics by
Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis, Jr.

To the next generation of explorers: Kristi, BreAnne, Lindsey, Randi, Piper,
Meghan, Wyatt, Lara, Mason, and Sheanna.

Fundamentals of Mathematics is a work text that covers the traditional
topics studied in a modern prealgebra course, as well as the topics of
estimation, element­ary analytic geometry, and introductory algebra. It is
intended for students who

   1. have had a previous course in prealgebra,
   2. wish to meet the prerequisite of a higher level course such as

      elementary algebra, and
   3. need to review fundamental mathematical concepts and techniques.

This text will help the student develop the insight and intuition necessary to
master arithmetic techniques and manipulative skills. It was written with the
following main objectives:

   1. to provide the student with an understandable and usable source of
      information,

   2. to provide the student with the maximum oppor­tunity to see that
      arithmetic concepts and techniques are logically based,

   3. to instill in the student the understanding and intuitive skills necessary
      to know how and when to use particular arithmetic concepts in
      subsequent material, courses, and nonclassroom situations, and

   4. to give the student the ability to correctly interpret arithmetically
      obtained results.

We have tried to meet these objectives by presenting material dynamically,
much the way an instructor might present the material visually in a
classroom. (See the development of the concept of addition and subtraction
of fractions in [link], for example.) Intuition and unders­ tanding are some of
the keys to creative thinking; we believe that the material presented in this
text will help the student realize that mathematics is a creative subject.
This text can be used in standard lecture or self-paced classes. To help meet
our objectives and to make the study of prealgebra a pleasant and rewarding
experie­ nce, Fundamentals of Mathematics is organized as follows.

Pedagogical Features

The work text format gives the student space to practice mathematical skills
with ready reference to sample problems. The chapters are divided into
sections, and each section is a complete treatment of a particular topic,
which includes the following features:

      Section Overview
      Sample Sets
      Practice Sets
      Section Exer­cises
      Exercises for Review
      Answers to Practice Sets

The chapters begin with Objectives and end with a Summary of Key
Concepts, an Exercise Supplement, and a Proficiency Exam.

Objectives
Each chapter begins with a set of objectives identifying the material to be
covered. Each section begins with an overview that repeats the objectives
for that particular section. Sections are divided into subsections that
correspond to the section object­ives, which makes for easier reading.

Sample Sets
Fundamentals of Mathematics contains examples that are set off in boxes
for easy reference. The examples are referred to as Sample Sets for two
reasons:

   1. They serve as a representation to be imitated, which we believe will
      foster understanding of mathematical concepts and provide experience
      with mathematical techniques.

   2. Sample Sets also serve as a preliminary representation of problem-
      solving techniques that may be used to solve more general and more
      complicated problems.

The examples have been carefully chosen to illustrate and develop concepts
and techniques in the most instructive, easily remembered way. Concepts
and techn­ iques preceding the examples are introduced at a level below that
normally used in similar texts and are thoroughly explained, assuming little
previous knowledge.

Practice Sets
A parallel Practice Set follows each Sample Set, which reinforces the
concepts just learned. There is adequate space for the student to work each
problem directly on the page.

Answers to Practice Sets
The Answers to Practice Sets are given at the end of each section and can
be easily located by referring to the page number, which appears after the
last Practice Set in each section.

Section Exercises
The exercises at the end of each section are graded in terms of difficulty,
although they are not grouped into categories. There is an ample number of
problems, and after working through the exercises, the student will be
capable of solving a variety of challenging problems.

The problems are paired so that the odd-numbered problems are equivalent
in kind and difficulty to the even-numbered problems. Answers to the odd-
numbered problems are provided at the back of the book.

Exercises for Review
This section consists of five problems that form a cumulative review of the
material covered in the preceding sections of the text and is not limited to
material in that chapter. The exercises are keyed by section for easy
reference. Since these exercises are intended for review only, no work space
is provided.

Summary of Key Concepts
A summary of the important ideas and formulas used throughout the
chapter is included at the end of each chapter. More than just a list of terms,
the summary is a valuable tool that reinforces concepts in preparation for
the Proficiency Exam at the end of the chapter, as well as future exams. The
summary keys each item to the section of the text where it is discussed.

Exercise Supplement
In addition to numerous section exercises, each chapter includes
approximately 100 supplemental problems, which are referenced by
section. Answers to the odd-numbered problems are included in the back of
the book.

Proficiency Exam
Each chapter ends with a Proficiency Exam that can serve as a chapter
review or evaluation. The Proficiency Exam is keyed to sections, which
enables the student to refer back to the text for assistance. Answers to all
the problems are included in the Answer Section at the end of the book.

Content

The writing style used in Fundamentals of Mathematics is informal and
friendly, offering a straightforward approach to prealgebra mathematics. We
have made a deliberate effort not to write another text that minimizes the
use of words because we believe that students can best study arithmetic
concepts and understand arithm­ etic techniques by using words and symbols
rather than symbols alone. It has been our experience that students at the
prealgebra level are not nearly experienced enough with mathematics to
understand symbolic explanations alone; they need literal explanations to
guide them through the symbols.

We have taken great care to present concepts and techniques so they are
unders­ tandable and easily remembered. After concepts have been
developed, students are warned about common pitfalls. We have tried to
make the text an information source accessible to prealgebra students.

Addition and Subtraction of Whole Numbers
This chapter in­cludes the study of whole numbers, including a discussion of
the Hindu-Arabic numeration and the base ten number systems. Rounding
whole numbers is also presented, as are the commutative and associative
properties of addition.

Multiplication and Division of Whole Numbers

The operations of multiplication and division of whole numbers are
explained in this chapter. Multi­plication is described as repeated addition.
Viewing multiplication in this way may provide students with a
visualization of the meaning of algebraic terms such as 8x when they start
learning algebra. The chapter also includes the commutative and associative
properties of multiplication.

Exponents, Roots, and Factorizations of Whole Numbers

The concept and meaning of the word root is introduced in this chapter. A
method of reading root notation and a method of determining some
common roots, both mentally and by calculator, is then presented. We also
present grouping symbols and the order of operations, prime factorization
of whole numbers, and the greatest common factor and least common
multiple of a collection of whole numbers.

Introduction to Fractions and Multiplication and Division of Frac­tions

We recognize that fractions constitute one of the foundations of problem
solving. We have, therefore, given a detailed treatment of the operations of
multi­plication and division of fractions and the logic behind these
operations. We believe that the logical treatment and many practice
exercises will help students retain the information presented in this chapter
and enable them to use it as a foundation for the study of rational
expressions in an algebra course.
Addition and Subtraction of Fractions, Comparing Fractions, and
Complex Fractions

A detailed treatment of the operations of addition and subt­raction of
fractions and the logic behind these operations is given in this chapter.
Again, we believe that the logical treatment and many practice exercises
will help students retain the information, thus enabling them to use it in the
study of rational expressions in an algebra course. We have tried to make
explanations dynamic. A method for comparing fractions is introduced,
which gives the student another way of understanding the relationship
between the words denominator and denomination. This method serves to
show the student that it is sometimes possible to compare two different
types of quantities. We also study a method of simplifying complex
fractions and of combining operations with fractions.

Decimals

The student is introduced to decimals in terms of the base ten number
system, fractions, and digits occurring to the right of the units position. A
method of converting a fraction to a decimal is discussed. The logic behind
the standard methods of operating on decimals is presented and many
examples of how to apply the methods are given. The word of as related to
the operation of multipli­cation is discussed. Nonterminating divisions are
examined, as are combinations of operations with decimals and fractions.

Ratios and Rates

We begin by defining and distinguishing the terms ratio and rate. The
meaning of proportion and some applications of proport­ion problems are
described. Proportion problems are solved using the "Five-Step Method."
We hope that by using this method the student will discover the value of
introducing a variable as a first step in problem solving and the power of
organizat­ion. The chapter concludes with discussions of percent, fractions
of one percent, and some applications of percent.
Techniques of Estimation

One of the most powerful problem-solvi­ng tools is a knowledge of
estimation techniques. We feel that estimation is so important that we
devote an entire chapter to its study. We examine three estima­tion
techniques: estimation by rounding, estimation by clustering, and
estimation by rounding fractions. We also include a section on the
distributive property, an important algebraic property.

Measurement and Geometry

This chapter presents some of the techniques of measurement in both the
United States system and the metric sys­tem. Conversion from one unit to
another (in a system) is examined in terms of unit fractions. A discussion of
the simplification of denominate numbers is also in­cluded. This discussion
helps the student understand more clearly the association between pure
numbers and dimensions. The chapter concludes with a study of perimeter
and circumference of geometric figures and area and volume of geometric
figures and objects.

Signed Numbers

A look at algebraic concepts and techniques is begun in this chapter. Basic
to the study of algebra is a working knowledge of signed numbers.
Definitions of variables, constants, and real numbers are introduced. We
then distinguish between positive and negative numbers, learn how to read
signed numbers, and examine the origin and use of the double-negative
property of real numbers. The concept of absolute value is presented both
geometrically (using the number line) and algebraically. The algebraic
definition is followed by an interpre­tation of its meaning and several
detailed examples of its use. Addition, subtrac­tion, multiplication, and
division of signed numbers are presented first using the number line, then
with absolute value.
Algebraic Expressions and Equations

The student is introduced to some elementary algebraic concepts and
techniques in this final chapter. Algeb­ raic expressions and the process of
combining like terms are discussed in [link] and [link]. The method of
combining like terms in an algebraic expression is explained by using the
interpretation of multiplication as a description of repeated addition (as in
[link]).

Numbers and Numerals

We begin our study of introductory mathematics by examining its most
basic building block, the number.

Number
A number is a concept. It exists only in the mind.

The earliest concept of a number was a thought that allowed people to
mentally picture the size of some collection of objects. To write down the
number being conceptualized, a numeral is used.

Numeral
A numeral is a symbol that represents a number.

In common usage today we do not distinguish between a number and a
numeral. In our study of introductory mathematics, we will follow this
common usage.
Sample Set A
The following are numerals. In each case, the first represents the number
four, the second repres­ ents the number one hundred twenty-three, and the
third, the number one thousand five. These numbers are represented in
different ways.

      Hindu-Arabic numerals
      4, 123, 1005
      Roman numerals
      IV, CXXIII, MV
      Egyptian numerals

Practice Set A
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Do the phrases "four," "one hundred twenty-three," and "one thousand
   five" qualify as numerals? Yes or no?

   Solution:
   Yes. Letters are symbols. Taken as a collection (a written word), they
   represent a number.

The Hindu-Arabic Numeration System

Hindu-Arabic Numeration System
Our society uses the Hindu-Arabic numeration system. This system of
numer­ation began shortly before the third century when the Hindus
invented the num­ erals

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Leonardo Fibonacci
About a thousand years later, in the thirteenth century, a mathematician
named Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa introduced the system into Europe. It
was then popul­arized by the Arabs. Thus, the name, Hindu-Arabic
numeration system.

The Base Ten Positional Number System

Digits
The Hindu-Arabic numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are called digits. We can
form any number in the number system by selecting one or more digits and
placing them in certain positions. Each position has a particular value. The
Hindu mathematician who devised the system about A.D. 500 stated that
"from place to place each is ten times the preceding."

Base Ten Positional Systems
It is for this reason that our number system is called a positional number
system with base ten.

Commas
When numbers are composed of more than three digits, commas are
sometimes used to separate the digits into groups of three.

Periods
These groups of three are called periods and they greatly simplify reading
numbers.

In the Hindu-Arabic numeration system, a period has a value assigned to
each or its three positions, and the values are the same for each period. The
position values are
Thus, each period contains a position for the values of one, ten, and
hundred. Notice that, in looking from right to left, the value of each position
is ten times the preceding. Each period has a particular name.

As we continue from right to left, there are more periods. The five periods
listed above are the most common, and in our study of introductory
mathematics, they are sufficient.
The following diagram illustrates our positional number system to trillions.
(There are, to be sure, other periods.)

In our positional number system, the value of a digit is determined by its
position in the number.

Sample Set B
Example:
Find the value of 6 in the number 7,261.
Since 6 is in the tens position of the units period, its value is 6 tens.
6 tens = 60

Example:
Find the value of 9 in the number 86,932,106,005.
Since 9 is in the hundreds position of the millions period, its value is 9
hundred millions.
9 hundred millions = 9 hundred million

Example:
Find the value of 2 in the number 102,001.
Since 2 is in the ones position of the thousands period, its value is 2 one
thousands.
2 one thousands = 2 thousand

Practice Set B
Exercise:

   Problem: Find the value of 5 in the number 65,000.

   Solution:
   five thousand
Exercise:

   Problem: Find the value of 4 in the number 439,997,007,010.

   Solution:
   four hundred billion
Exercise:

   Problem: Find the value of 0 in the number 108.

   Solution:

   zero tens, or zero

Whole Numbers

Whole Numbers
Numbers that are formed using only the digits
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
are called whole numbers. They are
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, ...

The three dots at the end mean "and so on in this same pattern."

Graphing Whole Numbers

Number Line
Whole numbers may be visualized by constructing a number line. To
construct a number line, we simply draw a straight line and choose any
point on the line and label it 0.

Origin
This point is called the origin. We then choose some convenient length, and
moving to the right, mark off consecutive intervals (parts) along the line
starting at 0. We label each new interval endpoint with the next whole
number.
Graphing
We can visually display a whole number by drawing a closed circle at the
point labeled with that whole number. Another phrase for visually
displaying a whole number is graphing the whole number. The word graph
means to "visually display."

Sample Set C

Example:
Graph the following whole numbers: 3, 5, 9.

Example:
Specify the whole numbers that are graphed on the following number line.
The break in the number line indicates that we are aware of the whole
numbers between 0 and 106, and 107 and 872, but we are not listing them
due to space limitations.

The numbers that have been graphed are
0, 106, 873, 874

Practice Set C
Exercise:
   Problem: Graph the following whole numbers: 46, 47, 48, 325, 327.

   Solution:

Exercise:
   Problem:
   Specify the whole numbers that are graphed on the following number
   line.

   Solution:
   4, 5, 6, 113, 978
A line is composed of an endless number of points. Notice that we have
labeled only some of them. As we proceed, we will discover new types of
numbers and determine their location on the number line.

Reading and Writing Whole Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to read and write whole
numbers. By the end of this module, students should be able to read and
write whole numbers.

Section Overview

      Reading Whole Numbers
      Writing Whole Numbers

Because our number system is a positional number system, reading and
writing whole numbers is quite simple.

Reading Whole Numbers

To convert a number that is formed by digits into a verbal phrase, use the
following method:

   1. Beginning at the right and working right to left, separate the number
      into distinct periods by inserting commas every three digits.

   2. Beginning at the left, read each period individually, saying the period
      name.

Sample Set A

Write the following numbers as words.

Example:
Read 42958.

   1. Beginning at the right, we can separate this number into distinct
      periods by inserting a comma between the 2 and 9.
      42,958
   2. Beginning at the left, we read each period individually:

      Forty-two thousand, nine hundred fifty-eight.

Example:
Read 307991343.

   1. Beginning at the right, we can separate this number into distinct
      periods by placing commas between the 1 and 3 and the 7 and 9.
      307,991,343

   2. Beginning at the left, we read each period individually.
      Three hundred seven million, nine hundred ninety-one thousand, three
      hundred forty-three.
Example:
Read 36000000000001.
   1. Beginning at the right, we can separate this number into distinct
      periods by placing commas. 36,000,000,001
   2. Beginning at the left, we read each period individually.

      Thirty-six trillion, one.
Practice Set A

Exercise:

   Problem: 12,542
   Solution:
   Twelve thousand, five hundred forty-two
Exercise:

   Problem: 101,074,003
   Solution:
   One hundred one million, seventy-four thousand, three
Exercise:

   Problem: 1,000,008
   Solution:
   One million, eight

Writing Whole Numbers

To express a number in digits that is expressed in words, use the following
method:

   1. Notice first that a number expressed as a verbal phrase will have its
      periods set off by commas.
   2. Starting at the beginning of the phrase, write each period of numbers
      individu­ally.

   3. Using commas to separate periods, combine the periods to form one
      number.

Sample Set B
Write each number using digits.

Example:
Seven thousand, ninety-two.
Using the comma as a period separator, we have

7,092

Example:
Fifty billion, one million, two hundred thousand, fourteen.
Using the commas as period separators, we have
50,001,200,014

Example:
Ten million, five hundred twelve.
The comma sets off the periods. We notice that there is no thousands
period. We'll have to insert this ourselves.

10,000,512

Rounding Whole Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis,
Jr. This module discusses how to round whole numbers. By the end of the module students
should be able to understand that rounding is a method of approximation and round a
whole number to a specified position.

Section Overview

      Rounding as an Approximation
      The Method of Rounding Numbers

Rounding as an Approximation

A primary use of whole numbers is to keep count of how many objects there are in a
collection. Sometimes we're only interested in the approximate number of objects in the
collection rather than the precise number. For example, there are approxi­mately 20
symbols in the collection below.

The precise number of symbols in the above collection is 18.
Rounding
We often approximate the number of objects in a collection by mentally seeing the
collection as occurring in groups of tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. This process of
approximation is called rounding. Rounding is very useful in estimation. We will study
estimation in Chapter 8.
When we think of a collection as occurring in groups of tens, we say we're rounding to the
nearest ten. When we think of a collection as occurring in groups of hundreds, we say
we're rounding to the nearest hundred. This idea of rounding continues through thousands,
ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions, etc.
The process of rounding whole numbers is illustrated in the following examples.

Example:
Round 67 to the nearest ten.
On the number line, 67 is more than halfway from 60 to 70. The digit immedi­ately to the
right of the tens digit, the round-off digit, is the indicator for this.

Thus, 67, rounded to the nearest ten, is 70.

Example:
Round 4,329 to the nearest hundred.
On the number line, 4,329 is less than halfway from 4,300 to 4,400. The digit to the
immediate right of the hundreds digit, the round-off digit, is the indicator.

Thus, 4,329, rounded to the nearest hundred is 4,300.

Example:
Round 16,500 to the nearest thousand.
On the number line, 16,500 is exactly halfway from 16,000 to 17,000.

By convention, when the number to be rounded is exactly halfway between two numbers,
it is rounded to the higher number.
Thus, 16,500, rounded to the nearest thousand, is 17,000.
Example:
A person whose salary is $41,450 per year might tell a friend that she makes $41,000 per
year. She has rounded 41,450 to the nearest thousand. The number 41,450 is closer to
41,000 than it is to 42,000.

The Method of Rounding Whole Numbers

From the observations made in the preceding examples, we can use the following method
to round a whole number to a particular position.

   1. Mark the position of the round-off digit.
   2. Note the digit to the immediate right of the round-off digit.

         a. If it is less than 5, replace it and all the digits to its right with zeros. Leave the
            round-off digit unchanged.

         b. If it is 5 or larger, replace it and all the digits to its right with zeros. Increase the
            round-off digit by 1.

Sample Set A
Use the method of rounding whole numbers to solve the following problems.

Example:
Round 3,426 to the nearest ten.

   1. We are rounding to the tens position. Mark the digit in the tens position

   2. Observe the digit immediately to the right of the tens position. It is 6. Since 6 is
      greater than 5, we round up by replacing 6 with 0 and adding 1 to the digit in the tens
      position (the round-off position): 2 + 1 = 3 .
      3,430

Thus, 3,426 rounded to the nearest ten is 3,430.
Example:
Round 9,614,018,007 to the nearest ten million.

   1. We are rounding to the nearest ten million.

   2. Observe the digit immediately to the right of the ten millions position. It is 4. Since 4
      is less than 5, we round down by replacing 4 and all the digits to its right with zeros.
      9,610,000,000

Thus, 9,614,018,007 rounded to the nearest ten million is 9,610,000,000.

Example:
Round 148,422 to the nearest million.

   1. Since we are rounding to the nearest million, we'll have to imagine a digit in the
      millions position. We'll write 148,422 as 0,148,422.

   2. The digit immediately to the right is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we'll round down by
      replacing it and all the digits to its right with zeros.
      0,000,000
      This number is 0.

Thus, 148,422 rounded to the nearest million is 0.

Example:
Round 397,000 to the nearest ten thousand.

   1. We are rounding to the nearest ten thousand.
   2. The digit immediately to the right of the ten thousand position is 7. Since 7 is greater
      than 5, we round up by replacing 7 and all the digits to its right with zeros and
      adding 1 to the digit in the ten thousands position. But 9 + 1 = 10 and we must
      carry the 1 to the next (the hundred thousands) position.
      400,000

Thus, 397,000 rounded to the nearest ten thousand is 400,000.

Addition of Whole Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to add whole numbers. By
the end of this module, students should be able to understand the addition
process, add whole numbers, and use the calculator to add one whole
number to another.

Section Overview

      Calculators

Addition

Suppose we have two collections of objects that we combine together to
form a third collection. For example,

We are combining a collection of four objects with a collection of three
objects to obtain a collection of seven objects.

Addition
The process of combining two or more objects (real or intuitive) to form a
third, the total, is called addition.

In addition, the numbers being added are called addends or terms, and the
total is called the sum. The plus symbol (+) is used to indicate addition,
and the equal symbol (=) is used to represent the word "equal." For
example, 4 + 3 = 7 means "four added to three equals seven."

Addition Visualized on the Number Line
Addition is easily visualized on the number line. Let's visualize the addition
of 4 and 3 using the number line.

To find 4 + 3,

   1. Start at 0.
   2. Move to the right 4 units. We are now located at 4.
   3. From 4, move to the right 3 units. We are now located at 7.

Thus, 4 + 3 = 7.

The Addition Process

We'll study the process of addition by considering the sum of 25 and 43.

    25  means
+43

We write this as 68.

We can suggest the following procedure for adding whole numbers using
this example.

Example:
The Process of Adding Whole Numbers
To add whole numbers,
The process:
   1. Write the numbers vertically, placing corresponding positions in the
      same column.

                 25
            +43

   2. Add the digits in each column. Start at the right (in the ones position)
      and move to the left, placing the sum at the bottom.

                 25
            +43

                 68

Note: Confusion and incorrect sums can occur when the numbers are not
aligned in columns properly. Avoid writing such additions as

25
+43

       25
+43

Sample Set A

Example:
Add 276 and 103.

     276 6 + 3 = 9.
+103 7 + 0 = 7.

     379 2 + 1 = 3.
Example:
Add 1459 and 130

 1459  9 + 0 = 9.
+130   5 + 3 = 8.
       4 + 1 = 5.
 1589  1 + 0 = 1.

In each of these examples, each individual sum does not exceed 9. We will
examine individual sums that exceed 9 in the next section.

Practice Set A
Perform each addition. Show the expanded form in problems 1 and 2.
Exercise:

   Problem: Add 63 and 25.
   Solution:
   88

Exercise:
   Problem: Add 4,026 and 1,501.
   Solution:
   5,527
Exercise:
   Problem: Add 231,045 and 36,121.
   Solution:
   267,166

Addition Involving Carrying

It often happens in addition that the sum of the digits in a column will
exceed 9. This happens when we add 18 and 34. We show this in expanded
form as follows.

Notice that when we add the 8 ones to the 4 ones we get 12 ones. We then
convert the 12 ones to 1 ten and 2 ones. In vertical addition, we show this
conversion by carrying the ten to the tens column. We write a 1 at the top
of the tens column to indicate the carry. This same example is shown in a
shorter form as follows:
8 + 4 = 12 Write 2, carry 1 ten to the top of the next column to the left.

Sample Set B
Perform the following additions. Use the process of carrying when needed.

Example:
Add 1875 and 358.

5 + 8 = 13        Write 3, carry 1 ten.
1 + 7 + 5 = 13    Write 3, carry 1 hundred.
1 + 8 + 3 = 12    Write 2, carry 1 thousand.
1+1 = 2

The sum is 2233.

Example:
Add 89,208 and 4,946.
8 + 6 = 14          Write 4, carry 1 ten.

1+0+4 = 5           Write the 5 (nothing to carry).

2 + 9 = 11          Write 1, carry one thousand.

1 + 9 + 4 = 14      Write 4, carry one ten thousand.

1+8 = 9

The sum is 94,154.

Example:
Add 38 and 95.

8 + 5 = 13          Write 3, carry 1 ten.

1 + 3 + 9 = 13      Write 3, carry 1 hundred.

1+0 = 1

As you proceed with the addition, it is a good idea to keep in mind what is
actually happening.

The sum is 133.
Example:
Find the sum 2648, 1359, and 861.

8 + 9 + 1 = 18      Write 8, carry 1 ten.
1 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 16  Write 6, carry 1 hundred.
1 + 6 + 3 + 8 = 18  Write 8, carry 1 thousand.
1+2+1 = 4

The sum is 4,868.

Numbers other than 1 can be carried as illustrated in [link].

Example:
Find the sum of the following numbers.
6 + 5 + 1 + 7 = 19      Write 9, carry the 1.
1+1+0+5+1 = 8           Write 8.
0 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 26      Write 6, carry the 2.
2 + 8 + 9 + 8 + 6 = 33  Write 3, carry the 3.
3 + 7 + 3 + 5 = 18      Write 8, carry the 1.
1+8 = 9                 Write 9.

The sum is 983,689.

Example:
The number of students enrolled at Riemann College in the years 1984,
1985, 1986, and 1987 was 10,406, 9,289, 10,108, and 11,412, respectively.
What was the total number of students enr­olled at Riemann College in the
years 1985, 1986, and 1987?
We can determine the total number of students enrolled by adding 9,289,
10,108, and 11,412, the number of students enrolled in the years 1985,
1986, and 1987.

The total number of students enrolled at Riemann College in the years
1985, 1986, and 1987 was 30,809.

Practice Set B
Perform each addition. For the next three problems, show the expanded
form.
Exercise:
   Problem: Add 58 and 29.
   Solution:
   87

     = 7 tens + 1 ten + 7 ones
     = 8 tens + 7 ones
     = 87

Exercise:
   Problem: Add 476 and 85.
   Solution:
   561

                = 4 hundreds + 15 tens + 1 ten + 1 one
                                     = 4 hundreds + 16 tens + 1 one

     = 4 hundreds + 1 hundred + 6 tens + 1 one
                                        = 5 hundreds + 6 tens + 1 one
                                                                                                        = 561

Exercise:
   Problem: Add 27 and 88.
   Solution:
   115

     = 10 tens + 1 ten + 5 ones
     = 11 tens + 5 ones
     = 1 hundred + 1 ten + 5 ones
     = 115

Calculators

Calculators provide a very simple and quick way to find sums of whole
numbers. For the two problems in Sample Set C, assume the use of a
calculator that does not require the use of an ENTER key (such as many
Hewlett-Packard calculators).

Sample Set C
Use a calculator to find each sum.
Example:

34 + 21                  Display Reads
                         34
Type                 34  34
                         21
Press                +   55

Type                 21

Press                =

The sum is 55.

Example:

106 + 85 + 322 + 406     Display
                         Reads
Type            106               The calculator keeps a
                         106      running subtotal

Press           +        106
                         85
Type            85
Press            =    191                      106 + 85
Type                                           191 + 322
Press            322  322                      513 + 406
Type
Press            +    513

                 406  406

                 =    919

The sum is 919.

Subtraction of Whole Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to subtract whole numbers.
By the end of this module, students should be able to understand the
subtraction process, subtract whole numbers, and use a calculator to
subtract one whole number from another whole number.

      Calculators

Subtraction

Subtraction
Subtraction is the process of determining the remainder when part of the
total is removed.

Suppose the sum of two whole numbers is 11, and from 11 we remove 4.
Using the number line to help our visualization, we see that if we are
located at 11 and move 4 units to the left, and thus remove 4 units, we will
be located at 7. Thus, 7 units remain when we remove 4 units from 11 units.

The Minus Symbol
The minus symbol (-) is used to indicate subtraction. For example, 11 - 4
indicates that 4 is to be subtracted from 11.

Minuend
The number immediately in front of or the minus symbol is called the
minuend, and it represents the original number of units.
Subtrahend
The number immediately following or below the minus symbol is called the
subtrahend, and it represents the number of units to be removed.
Difference
The result of the subtraction is called the difference of the two numbers.
For example, in 11 - 4 = 7, 11 is the minuend, 4 is the subtrahend, and 7 is
the difference.

Subtraction as the Opposite of Addition

Subtraction can be thought of as the opposite of addition. We show this in
the problems in Sample Set A.

Sample Set A

Example:
8 - 5 = 3 since 3 + 5 = 8.

Example:
9 - 3 = 6 since 6 + 3 = 9.

Practice Set A
Complete the following statements.
Exercise:
   Problem:7 - 5 = since +5 = 7.
   Solution:
   7 - 5 = 2 since 2 + 5 = 7
Exercise:
   Problem:9 - 1 = since +1 = 9.
   Solution:
   9 - 1 = 8 since 8 + 1 = 9
Exercise:
   Problem:17 - 8 = since +8 = 17.
   Solution:
   17 - 8 = 9 since 9 + 8 = 17

The Subtraction Process

We'll study the process of the subtraction of two whole numbers by
considering the difference between 48 and 35.

which we write as 13.

Example:
The Process of Subtracting Whole Numbers
To subtract two whole numbers,
The process

   1. Write the numbers vertically, placing corresponding positions in the
      same column.

                 48
            -35

   2. Subtract the digits in each column. Start at the right, in the ones
      position, and move to the left, placing the difference at the bottom.

                 48
            -35

                 13

Sample Set B
Perform the following subtractions.

Example:

     275
-142

     133
 5 - 2 = 3.
 7 - 4 = 3.
 2 - 1 = 1.

Example:
    46,042
- 1,031

    45,011
2 - 1 = 1.
4 - 3 = 1.
0 - 0 = 0.
6 - 1 = 5.
4 - 0 = 4.

Example:
Find the difference between 977 and 235.
Write the numbers vertically, placing the larger number on top. Line up the
columns properly.

    977
-235

    742

The difference between 977 and 235 is 742.

Example:
In Keys County in 1987, there were 809 cable television installations. In
Flags County in 1987, there were 1,159 cable television installations. How
many more cable television installations were there in Flags County than in
Keys County in 1987?
We need to determine the difference between 1,159 and 809.
There were 350 more cable television installations in Flags County than in
Keys County in 1987.

   Solution:

   62,114

In each of these problems, each bottom digit is less than the corresponding
top digit. This may not always be the case. We will examine the case where
the bottom digit is greater than the corresponding top digit in the next
section.

Subtraction Involving Borrowing

Minuend and Subtrahend
It often happens in the subtraction of two whole numbers that a digit in the
minuend (top number) will be less than the digit in the same position in the
subtrahend (bottom number). This happens when we subtract 27 from 84.

    84
-27

We do not have a name for 4 - 7. We need to rename 84 in order to
continue. We'll do so as follows:
Our new name for 84 is 7 tens + 14 ones.

= 57

Notice that we converted 8 tens to 7 tens + 1 ten, and then we converted the
1 ten to 10 ones. We then had 14 ones and were able to perform the
subtraction.
Borrowing
The process of borrowing (converting) is illustrated in the problems of
Sample Set C.

Sample Set C

Example:
   1. Borrow 1 ten from the 8 tens. This leaves 7 tens.
   2. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones.
   3. Add 10 ones to 4 ones to get 14 ones.

Example:

   1. Borrow 1 hundred from the 6 hundreds. This leaves 5 hundreds.
   2. Convert the 1 hundred to 10 tens.
   3. Add 10 tens to 7 tens to get 17 tens.

Borrowing More Than Once
Sometimes it is necessary to borrow more than once. This is shown in the
problems in [link].

Sample Set D
Perform the Subtractions. Borrowing more than once if necessary

Example:

   1. Borrow 1 ten from the 4 tens. This leaves 3 tens.
   2. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones.
   3. Add 10 ones to 1 one to get 11 ones. We can now perform 11 - 8.
   4. Borrow 1 hundred from the 6 hundreds. This leaves 5 hundreds.
   5. Convert the 1 hundred to 10 tens.
   6. Add 10 tens to 3 tens to get 13 tens.
   7. Now 13 - 5 = 8.
   8. 5 - 3 = 2.

Example:
   1. Borrow 1 ten from the 3 tens. This leaves 2 tens.
   2. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones.
   3. Add 10 ones to 4 ones to get 14 ones. We can now perform 14 - 5.
   4. Borrow 1 hundred from the 5 hundreds. This leaves 4 hundreds.
   5. Convert the 1 hundred to 10 tens.
   6. Add 10 tens to 2 tens to get 12 tens. We can now perform 12 - 8 = 4.
   7. Finally, 4 - 0 = 4.

Example:

 71529
- 6952

After borrowing, we have

Borrowing from Zero

It often happens in a subtraction problem that we have to borrow from one
or more zeros. This occurs in problems such as

                503

   1.

           - 37

      and
                5000

   2.

           - 37

We'll examine each case.

Example:
Borrowing from a single zero.

                                                         503

Consider the problem

                                                    - 37

Since we do not have a name for 3 - 7, we must borrow from 0.

Since there are no tens to borrow, we must borrow 1 hundred. One hundred
= 10 tens.

We can now borrow 1 ten from 10 tens (leaving 9 tens). One ten = 10 ones
and 10 ones + 3 ones = 13 ones.

Now we can suggest the following method for borrowing from a single
zero.
Borrowing from a Single Zero
To borrow from a single zero,
   1. Decrease the digit to the immediate left of zero by one.
   2. Draw a line through the zero and make it a 10.
   3. Proceed to subtract as usual.

Sample Set E

Example:
Perform this subtraction.

     503
- 37

The number 503 contains a single zero
   1. The number to the immediate left of 0 is 5. Decrease 5 by 1.

            5-1 = 4

   2. Draw a line through the zero and make it a 10.
   3. Borrow from the 10 and proceed.

            1 ten + 10 ones
            10 ones + 3 ones = 13 ones
Practice Set E
Perform each subtraction.

   Solution:

Example:
Borrowing from a group of zeros

                                                         5000

Consider the problem

                                                    - 37

In this case, we have a group of zeros.

Since we cannot borrow any tens or hundreds, we must borrow 1 thousand.
One thousand = 10 hundreds.

We can now borrow 1 hundred from 10 hundreds. One hundred = 10 tens.

We can now borrow 1 ten from 10 tens. One ten = 10 ones.

From observations made in this procedure we can suggest the following
method for borrowing from a group of zeros.

Borrowing from a Group of zeros
To borrow from a group of zeros,

   1. Decrease the digit to the immediate left of the group of zeros by one.
   2. Draw a line through each zero in the group and make it a 9, except the

      rightmost zero, make it 10.
   3. Proceed to subtract as usual.
Sample Set F
Perform each subtraction.

Example:

    40,000
- 125

The number 40,000 contains a group of zeros.
   1. The number to the immediate left of the group is 4. Decrease 4 by 1.

            4-1 = 3

   2. Make each 0, except the rightmost one, 9. Make the rightmost 0 a 10.

   3. Subtract as usual.

Example:

      8,000,006

The number 8,000,006 contains a group of zeros.

   1. The number to the immediate left of the group is 8. Decrease 8 by 1.
            8-1 = 7

   2. Make each zero, except the rightmost one, 9. Make the rightmost 0 a
      10.

   3. To perform the subtraction, we'll need to borrow from the ten.

            1 ten = 10 ones
            10 ones + 6 ones = 16 ones

Practice Set F
Perform each subtraction.

Properties of Addition
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses properties of addition. By the end
of the module students should be able to understand the commutative and
associative properties of addition and understand why 0 is the additive
identity.

Section Overview

      The Commutative Property of Addition
      The Associative Property of Addition
      The Additive Identity
We now consider three simple but very important properties of addition.

The Commutative Property of Addition

Commutative Property of Addition
If two whole numbers are added in any order, the sum will not change.

Sample Set A

Example:
Add the whole numbers

8 + 5 = 13
5 + 8 = 13
The numbers 8 and 5 can be added in any order. Regardless of the order
they are added, the sum is 13.

Practice Set A
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Use the commutative property of addition to find the sum of 12 and 41
   in two different ways.

   Solution:
   12 + 41 = 53 and 41 + 12 = 53
Exercise:
   Problem: Add the whole numbers

   Solution:
   837 + 1,958 = 2,795 and 1,958 + 837 = 2,795

The Associative Property of Addition
Associative Property of Addition
If three whole numbers are to be added, the sum will be the same if the first
two are added first, then that sum is added to the third, or, the second two
are added first, and that sum is added to the first.
Using Parentheses
It is a common mathematical practice to use parentheses to show which
pair of numbers we wish to combine first.

Sample Set B

Example:
Add the whole numbers.

Practice Set B
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Use the associative property of addition to add the following whole
   numbers two different ways.
   Solution:
   (17 + 32) + 25 = 49 + 25 = 74 and

     17 + (32 + 25) = 17 + 57 = 74

Exercise:
   Problem:

   Solution:

     (1,629 + 806) + 429 = 2,435 + 429 = 2,864
     1,629 + (806 + 429) = 1,629 + 1,235 = 2,864

The Additive Identity

0 Is the Additive Identity
The whole number 0 is called the additive identity, since when it is added
to any whole number, the sum is identical to that whole number.

Sample Set C

Example:
Add the whole numbers.
29 + 0 = 29
0 + 29 = 29

Zero added to 29 does not change the identity of 29.

Practice Set C
Add the following whole numbers.

   Problem:

   Solution:
   8
Exercise:
   Problem:

   Solution:

Summary of Key Concepts
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module reviews the key concepts from the chapter
Addition and Subtraction of Whole Numbers.

Summary of Key Concepts

Number / Numeral ([link])
A number is a concept. It exists only in the mind. A numeral is a symbol
that represents a number. It is customary not to distinguish between the two
(but we should remain aware of the difference).

Hindu-Arabic Numeration System ([link])
In our society, we use the Hindu-Arabic numeration system. It was
invented by the Hindus shortly before the third century and popularized by
the Arabs about a thousand years later.

Digits ([link])
The numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are called digits.

Base Ten Positional System ([link])
The Hindu-Arabic numeration system is a positional number system with
base ten. Each position has value that is ten times the value of the position
to its right.

Commas / Periods ([link])
Commas are used to separate digits into groups of three. Each group of
three is called a period. Each period has a name. From right to left, they are
ones, thou­sands, millions, billions, etc.
Whole Numbers ([link])
A whole number is any number that is formed using only the digits (0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

Number Line ([link])
The number line allows us to visually display the whole numbers.

Graphing ([link])
Graphing a whole number is a term used for visually displaying the whole
number. The graph of 4 appears below.

Reading Whole Numbers ([link])
To express a whole number as a verbal phrase:

   1. Begin at the right and, working right to left, separate the number into
      distinct periods by inserting commas every three digits.

   2. Begin at the left, and read each period individually.

Writing Whole Numbers ([link])
To rename a number that is expressed in words to a number expressed in
digits:

   1. Notice that a number expressed as a verbal phrase will have its periods
      set off by commas.

   2. Start at the beginning of the sentence, and write each period of
      numbers individu­ ally.

   3. Use commas to separate periods, and combine the periods to form one
      number.

Rounding ([link])
Rounding is the process of approximating the number of a group of objects
by mentally "seeing" the collection as occurring in groups of tens,
hundreds, thous­ ands, etc.
Addition ([link])
Addition is the process of combining two or more objects (real or intuitive)
to form a new, third object, the total, or sum.

Addends / Sum ([link])
In addition, the numbers being added are called addends and the result, or
total, the sum.

Subtraction ([link])
Subtraction is the process of determining the remainder when part of the
total is removed.

Minuend / Subtrahend Difference ([link])

Commutative Property of Addition ([link])
If two whole numbers are added in either of two orders, the sum will not
change.

3+5 = 5+3

Associative Property of Addition ([link])
If three whole numbers are to be added, the sum will be the same if the first
two are added and that sum is then added to the third, or if the second two
are added and the first is added to that sum.

(3 + 5) + 2 = 3 + (5 + 2)

Parentheses in Addition ([link])
Parentheses in addition indicate which numbers are to be added first.

Additive Identity ([link])
The whole number 0 is called the additive identity since, when it is added
to any particular whole number, the sum is identical to that whole number.

0+7 = 7
7+0 = 7

Multiplication

Multiplication is a description of repeated addition.

In the addition of

5+5+5

the number 5 is repeated 3 times. Therefore, we say we have three times five and describe it by
writing

3×5

Thus,

3×5 = 5+5+5

Multiplicand
In a multiplication, the repeated addend (number being added) is called the multi­plicand. In
3 × 5, the 5 is the multiplicand.

Multiplier
Also, in a multiplication, the number that records the number of times the multiplicand is used is
called the multiplier. In 3 × 5, the 3 is the multiplier.

Sample Set A

Express each repeated addition as a multiplication. In each case, specify the multiplier and the
multiplicand.
Example:

7+7+7+7+7+7

6 × 7. Multiplier is 6. Multiplicand is 7.

Example:

18 + 18 + 18

3 × 18. Multiplier is 3. Multiplicand is 18.

Practice Set A
Express each repeated addition as a multiplication. In each case, specify the multiplier and the
multiplicand.
Exercise:

   Problem: 12 + 12 + 12 + 12
   . Multiplier is . Multiplicand is .
   Solution:
   4 × 12. Multiplier is 4. Multiplicand is 12.
Exercise:

   Problem: 36 + 36 + 36 + 36 + 36 + 36 + 36 + 36
   . Multiplier is . Multiplicand is .
   Solution:
   8 × 36. Multiplier is 8. Multiplicand is 36.
Exercise:

   Problem: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
   . Multiplier is . Multiplicand is .
   Solution:
   5 × 0. Multiplier is 5. Multiplicand is 0.
Exercise:
                              1847 + 1847 + ... + 1847

   Problem:

                                             12,000 times

   . Multiplier is . Multiplicand is .
   Solution:
   12,000 × 1,847. Multiplier is 12,000. Multiplicand is 1,847.

Factors
In a multiplication, the numbers being multiplied are also called factors.
Products
The result of a multiplication is called the product. In 3 × 5 = 15, the 3 and 5 are not only called
the multiplier and multiplicand, but they are also called factors. The product is 15.
Indicators of Multiplication ×,,( )
The multiplication symbol (×) is not the only symbol used to indicate multiplication. Other
symbols include the dot (  ) and pairs of parentheses ( ). The expressions
3 × 5, 3  5, 3(5), (3)5, (3)(5)
all represent the same product.

The Multiplication Process With a Single Digit Multiplier

Since multiplication is repeated addition, we should not be surprised to notice that carrying can
occur. Carrying occurs when we find the product of 38 and 7:

First, we compute 7 × 8 = 56. Write the 6 in the ones column. Carry the 5. Then take
7 × 3 = 21. Add to 21 the 5 that was carried: 21 + 5 = 26. The product is 266.

Sample Set B
Find the following products.

Example:
3 × 4 = 12  Write the 2, carry the 1.

3 × 6 = 18  Add to 18 the 1 that was carried: 18 + 1 = 19.

The product is 192.

Example:

5 × 6 = 30  Write the 0, carry the 3.

5 × 2 = 10  Add to 10 the 3 that was carried: 10 + 3 = 13. Write the 3, carry the 1.

5 × 5 = 25  Add to 25 the 1 that was carried: 25 + 1 = 6.

The product is 2,630.

Example:

9 × 4 = 36  Write the 6, carry the 3.

9×0 = 0     Add to the 0 the 3 that was carried: 0 + 3 = 3. Write the 3.

9 × 8 = 72  Write the 2, carry the 7.

9×1 = 9     Add to the 9 the 7 that was carried: 9 + 7 = 16.

                                     Since there are no more multiplications to perf orm,write both the 1 and 6.

The product is 16,236.

The Multiplication Process With a Multiple Digit Multiplier
In a multiplication in which the multiplier is composed of two or more digits, the multiplication
must take place in parts. The process is as follows:

      Part 1 First Partial Product Multiply the multiplicand by the ones digit of the multiplier.
      This product is called the first partial product.
      Part 2 Second Partial Product Multiply the multiplicand by the tens digit of the multiplier.
      This product is called the second partial product. Since the tens digit is used as a factor, the
      second partial product is written below the first partial product so that its rightmost digit
      appears in the tens column.
      Part 3 If necessary, continue this way finding partial products. Write each one below the
      previous one so that the rightmost digit appears in the column directly below the digit that
      was used as a factor.
      Part 4 Total Product Add the partial products to obtain the total product.

Note:It may be necessary to carry when finding each partial product.

Sample Set C

Example:
Multiply 326 by 48.

      Part 1

      Part 2

      Part 3This step is unnecessary since all of the digits in the multiplier have been used.
      Part 4Add the partial products to obtain the total product.
      The product is 15,648.
Example:
Multiply 5,369 by 842.

      Part 1
      Part 2

      Part 3

      The product is 4,520,698.
Example:
Multiply 1,508 by 206.

      Part 1

      Part 2

      Since 0 times 1508 is 0, the partial product will not change the identity of the total product
      (which is obtained by addition). Go to the next partial product.
      Part 3

      The product is 310,648

Multiplications With Numbers Ending in Zero

Often, when performing a multiplication, one or both of the factors will end in zeros. Such
multiplications can be done quickly by aligning the numbers so that the rightmost nonzero digits
are in the same column.

Sample Set D
Perform the multiplication (49,000)(1,200).

(49,000)(1,200) =  49000

                   × 1200

Since 9 and 2 are the rightmost nonzero digits, put them in the same column.

Draw (perhaps mentally) a vertical line to separate the zeros from the nonzeros.

Multiply the numbers to the left of the vertical line as usual, then attach to the right end of this
product the total number of zeros.
The product is 58,800,000

Press                              =

The display now reads 7667. We'll have to add the zeros ourselves. There are a total of 12 zeros.
Attaching 12 zeros to 7667, we get 7,667,000,000,000,000.
The product is 7,667,000,000,000,000.

Concepts of Division of Whole Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to divide whole numbers. By
the end of the module students should be able to understand the process of
division, understand division of a nonzero number into zero, understand
why division by zero is undefined, and use a calculator to divide one whole
number by another.

Division

Division is a description of repeated subtraction.

In the process of division, the concern is how many times one number is
contained in another number. For example, we might be interested in how
many 5's are contained in 15. The word times is significant because it
implies a relationship between division and multiplication.

There are several notations used to indicate division. Suppose Q records the
number of times 5 is contained in 15. We can indicate this by writing

        Q  15
5 15
                  =Q

            5

                        15 divided by 5
5 into 15

 15/5 = Q 15 ÷ 5 = Q

15 divided by 5 15 divided by 5
Each of these division notations describes the same number, represented
here by the symbol Q. Each notation also converts to the same
multiplication form. It is 15 = 5 × Q

In division,

Dividend
the number being divided into is called the dividend.

Divisor
the number dividing into the dividend is the divisor.

Quotient
the result of the division is called the quotient.

                      quotient
divisor dividend

dividend   = quotient
  divisor

dividend/divisor = quotient dividend ÷ divisor = quotient

Sample Set A
Find the following quotients using multiplication facts.

Example:

18 ÷ 6

Since 6 × 3 = 18,

18 ÷ 6 = 3

Notice also that
 18
-6

 12
-6 Repeated subtraction

    6
-6

    0

Thus, 6 is contained in 18 three times.

Example:

 24
   3

Since 3 × 8 = 24,

 24

        =8

   3

Notice also that 3 could be subtracted exactly 8 times from 24. This
implies that 3 is contained in 24 eight times.

Example:

 36
   6

Since 6 × 6 = 36,

 36

        =6

   6

Thus, there are 6 sixes in 36.

Example:

9 72

Since 9 × 8 = 72,

          8
9 72

Thus, there are 8 nines in 72.

Division into Zero (Zero as a Dividend:                       0  , a  0)
                                                              a

Let's look at what happens when the dividend (the number being divided
into) is zero, and the divisor (the number doing the dividing) is any whole
number except zero. The question is

What number, if any, is                 0?
                                    any nonzero whole number

Let's represent this unknown quotient by Q. Then,

                                 0  =Q
any nonzero whole number

Converting this division problem to its corresponding multiplication
problem, we get

0 = Q × (any nonzero whole number)

From our knowledge of multiplication, we can understand that if the
product of two whole numbers is zero, then one or both of the whole
numbers must be zero. Since any nonzero whole number is certainly not
zero, Q must represent zero. Then,

                                 0  =0
any nonzero whole number
Zero Divided By Any Nonzero Whole Number Is Zero
Zero divided any nonzero whole number is zero.

Division  by  Zero     (Zero            as  a  Divisor:   a  , a  0)
                                                          0

Now we ask,

What number, if any, is any nonzero whole number ?
                                                                                                                  0

Letting Q represent a possible quotient, we get

any nonzero whole number            =Q
                                 0

Converting to the corresponding multiplication form, we have

(any nonzero whole number) = Q × 0

Since Q × 0 = 0, (any nonzero whole number) = 0. But this is absurd.
This would mean that 6 = 0, or 37 = 0. A nonzero whole number cannot
equal 0! Thus,

any nonzero whole number does not name a number
                                   0

Division by Zero is Undefined
Division by zero does not name a number. It is, therefore, undefined.

Division  by  and  Into             Zero    (Zero  as  a  Dividend                                                              and  Divisor:  0  )
                                                                                                                                               0

We  are  now  curious  about        zero    divided  by  zero  (                                                     0  ).  If  we  let  Q  represent  a
                                                                                                                     0

potential quotient, we get

0

     =Q

0

Converting to the multiplication form,

0 = Q×0
This results in

0=0

This is a statement that is true regardless of the number used in place of Q.
For example,

0 0 = 5, since 0 = 5 × 0.

0 = 31, since 0 = 31 × 0.

0

0 = 286, since 0 = 286 × 0.

0

A unique quotient cannot be determined.

Indeterminant

Since the result of the division is inconclusive, we say that          0  is
                                                                       0

indeterminant.

0  is Indeterminant
0

The division  0   is indeterminant.
              0

Sample Set B
Perform, if possible, each division.

Example:

19  .  Since  division  by  0  does  not  name  a  whole  number,  no  quotient  exists,
 0

and we state  19  is undefined
               0

Example:
0 14 . Since division by 0 does not name a defined number, no quotient
exists, and we state 0 14 is undefined

Example:
9 0 . Since division into 0 by any nonzero whole number results in 0, we

have 0

            90

Example:

0  .  Since  division  into  0  by  any  nonzero  whole  number  results  in  0,  we
7

have 7 0 = 0

Division of Whole Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to divide whole numbers. By
the end of the module students should be able to be able to divide a whole
number by a single or multiple digit divisor and interpret a calculator
statement that a division results in a remainder.

Division with a Single Digit Divisor

Our experience with multiplication of whole numbers allows us to perform
such divisions as 75 ÷ 5. We perform the division by performing the
corresponding multiplication, 5 × Q = 75. Each division we considered in
[link] had a one-digit quotient. Now we will consider divisions in which the
quotient may consist of two or more digits. For example, 75 ÷ 5.

Let's examine the division 75 ÷ 5. We are asked to determine how many 5's
are contained in 75. We'll approach the problem in the following way.

   1. Make an educated guess based on experience with multiplication.
   2. Find how close the estimate is by multiplying the estimate by 5.
   3. If the product obtained in step 2 is less than 75, find out how much less

      by subtracting it from 75.
   4. If the product obtained in step 2 is greater than 75, decrease the

      estimate until the product is less than 75. Decreasing the estimate
      makes sense because we do not wish to exceed 75.

We can suggest from this discussion that the process of division consists of
The Four Steps in Division

   1. an educated guess
   2. a multiplication
   3. a subtraction
   4. bringing down the next digit (if necessary)

The educated guess can be made by determining how many times the
divisor is contained in the dividend by using only one or two digits of the
dividend.

Sample Set A

Example:
Find 75 ÷ 5.
5 75 Rewrite the problem using a division bracket.

10

5 75

Make an educated guess by noting that one 5 is contained in 75 at most 10
times.
Since 7 is the tens digit, we estimate that 5 goes into 75 at most 10 times.

       10

5 75
  -50

25

Now determine how close the estimate is.
10 fives is 10 × 5 = 50. Subtract 50 from 75.
Estimate the number of 5's in 25.
There are exactly 5 fives in 25.

5       10 f ives + 5 f ives = 15 f ives.

}

10 There are 15 f ives contained in 75.

5 75
  -50

    25
-25

   0
Check:

Thus, 75 ÷ 5 = 15.
The notation in this division can be shortened by writing.

       15

5 75            5 goes into 7 at most 1 time.
  -5
      25
  -25
         0

Divide:

Multiply:       1 × 5 = 5. Write 5 below 7.
                7 - 5 = 2. Bring down the 5.
                5 goes into 25 exactly 5 times.
     Subtract:

Divide:

Multiply:       5 × 5 = 25. Write 25 below 25.
                25 - 25 = 0.

     Subtract:

Example:
Find 4,944 ÷ 8.

8 4944

Rewrite the problem using a division bracket.

         600

8 4944
  -4800

         144

8 goes into 49 at most 6 times, and 9 is in the hundreds column. We'll
guess 600.
Then, 8 × 600 = 4800.
            10
         600
8 4944
  -4800
         144
    - 80

            64

8 goes into 14 at most 1 time, and 4 is in the tens column. We'll guess 10.

               8
            10
         600
8 4944
  -4800
         144
    - 80
            64
        -64

               0

8 goes into 64 exactly 8 times.
600 eights + 10 eights + 8 eights = 618 eights.
Check:

Thus, 4,944 ÷ 8 = 618.
As in the first problem, the notation in this division can be shortened by
eliminating the subtraction signs and the zeros in each educated guess.
Divide:         8 goes into 49 at most 6 times.
                6 × 8 = 48. Write 48 below 49.
Multiply:       49 - 48 = 1. Bring down the 4.
                8 goes into 14 at most 1 time.
                1 × 8 = 8. Write 8 below 14.
     Subtract:  14 - 8 = 6. Bring down the 4.
                8 goes into 64 exactly 8 times.
Divide:         8 × 8 = 64. Write 64 below 64.
                64 - 64 = 0.

Division with a Multiple Digit Divisor

The process of division also works when the divisor consists of two or more
digits. We now make educated guesses using the first digit of the divisor
and one or two digits of the dividend.

Sample Set B

Example:
Find 2,232 ÷ 36.
36 2232

Use the first digit of the divisor and the first two digits of the dividend to
make the educated guess.
3 goes into 22 at most 7 times.
Try 7: 7 × 36 = 252 which is greater than 223. Reduce the estimate.
Try 6: 6 × 36 = 216 which is less than 223.

Multiply: 6 × 36 = 216. Write 216 below 223.
Subtract: 223 - 216 = 7. Bring down the 2.

Divide 3 into 7 to estimate the number of times 36 goes into 72. The 3 goes
into 7 at most 2 times.
Try 2: 2 × 36 = 72.

Check:

Thus, 2,232 ÷ 36 = 62.

Example:
Find 2,417,228 ÷ 802.

802 2417228

First, the educated guess: 24 ÷ 8 = 3. Then 3 × 802 = 2406, which is
less than 2417. Use 3 as the guess. Since 3 × 802 = 2406, and 2406 has
four digits, place the 3 above the fourth digit of the dividend.

Subtract: 2417 - 2406 = 11.
Bring down the 2.
The divisor 802 goes into 112 at most 0 times. Use 0.

Multiply:  0 × 802 = 0.

Subtract:  112 - 0 = 112.

Bring down the 2.

The 8 goes into 11 at most 1 time, and 1 × 802 = 802, which is less than
1122. Try 1.

Subtract 1122 - 802 = 320
Bring down the 8.
8 goes into 32 at most 4 times.
4 × 802 = 3208.
Use 4.

Check:

Thus, 2,417,228 ÷ 802 = 3,014.

Division with a Remainder

We might wonder how many times 4 is contained in 10. Repeated
subtraction yields

    10
- 4

       6
  -4

       2

Since the remainder is less than 4, we stop the subtraction. Thus, 4 goes into
10 two times with 2 remaining. We can write this as a division as follows.
          2  4 goes into 10 at most 2 times.
4 10

  - 8
          2

Divide:

Multiply: 2 × 4 = 8. Write 8 below 0.

Subtract: 10 - 8 = 2.

Since 4 does not divide into 2 (the remainder is less than the divisor) and
there are no digits to bring down to continue the process, we are done. We
write

2 R2

4 10 or 10 ÷ 4 =       2 R2
                       
         -8

                                                  2 with remainder 2

2

Sample Set C

Example:
Find 85 ÷ 3.

Divide:         3 goes into 8 at most 2 times.
                2 × 3 = 6. Write 6 below 8.
Multiply:       8 - 6 = 2. Bring down the 5.


     Subtract:
Divide:         3 goes into 25 at most 8 times.

Multiply: 3 × 8 = 24. Write 24 below 25.

                25 - 24 = 1.
     Subtract:

There are no more digits to bring down to continue the process. We are
done. One is the remainder.
Check: Multiply 28 and 3, then add 1.

28

× 3

84

+ 1

    85

Thus, 85 ÷ 3 = 28 R1.

Example:
Find 726 ÷ 23.

Check: Multiply 31 by 23, then add 13.

Thus, 726 ÷ 23 = 31R13.

Calculators

The calculator can be useful for finding quotients with single and multiple
digit divisors. If, however, the division should result in a remainder, the
calculator is unable to provide us with the particular value of the remainder.
Also, some calculators (most nonscientific) are unable to perform divisions
in which one of the numbers has more than eight digits.

Sample Set D
Use a calculator to perform each division.

Example:

328 ÷ 8

Type                       328

Press                      ÷

Type                       8

Press                      =

The display now reads 41.
Example:

53,136 ÷ 82

   Type                     53136
   Press                    ÷
   Type                     82
   Press                    =
The display now reads 648.

Example:

730,019,001 ÷ 326

We first try to enter 730,019,001 but find that we can only enter 73001900.
If our calculator has only an eight-digit display (as most nonscientific
calculators do), we will be unable to use the calculator to perform this
division.

Example:

3727 ÷ 49
Type   3727

Press  ÷

Type   49

Press  =

The display now reads 76.061224.
This number is an example of a decimal number (see [link]). When a
decimal number results in a calculator division, we can conclude that the
division produces a remainder.

Use a calculator to perform each division.

   Solution:
   551
Exercise:

   Problem: 21,996,385,287 ÷ 53
   Solution:
   Since the dividend has more than eight digits, this division cannot be
   performed on most nonscientific calculators. On others, the answer is
   415,026,137.4
Exercise:

   Problem: 4,558 ÷ 67

   Solution:
   This division results in 68.02985075, a decimal number, and therefore,
   we cannot, at this time, find the value of the remainder. Later, we will
   discuss decimal numbers.

Some Interesting Facts about Division
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses interesting facts about diving
whole numbers. By the end of the module students should be able to
recognize a whole number that is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10.

Section Overview

      Division by 2, 3, 4, and 5
      Division by 6, 8, 9, and 10

Quite often, we are able to determine if a whole number is divisible by
another whole number just by observing some simple facts about the
number. Some of these facts are listed in this section.

Division by 2, 3, 4, and 5

Division by 2
A whole number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

The numbers 80, 112, 64, 326, and 1,008 are all divisible by 2 since the last
digit of each is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, respectively.

The numbers 85 and 731 are not divisible by 2.

Division by 3
A whole number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

Properties of Multiplication
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses
properties of multiplication of whole numbers. By the end of the module students should be able to understand and
appreciate the commutative and associative properties of multiplication and understand why 1 is the multiplicative
identity.

Section Overview

      The Commutative Property of Multiplication
      The Associative Property of Multiplication
      The Multiplicative Identity
We will now examine three simple but very important properties of multiplication.

The Commutative Property of Multiplication

Commutative Property of Multiplication
The product of two whole numbers is the same regardless of the order of the factors.

Sample Set A

Example:
Multiply the two whole numbers.

6  7 = 42
7  6 = 42

The numbers 6 and 7 can be multiplied in any order. Regardless of the order they are multiplied, the product is 42.

Practice Set A
Use the commutative property of multiplication to find the products in two ways.
Exercise:

   Problem:

   Solution:
   15  6 = 90 and 6  15 = 90
Exercise:
   Problem:
   Solution:
   432  428 = 184,896 and 428  432 = 184,896

The Associative Property of Multiplication

Associative Property of Multiplication
If three whole numbers are multiplied, the product will be the same if the first two are multiplied first and then that
product is multiplied by the third, or if the second two are multiplied first and that product is multiplied by the
first. Note that the order of the factors is maintained.
It is a common mathematical practice to use parentheses to show which pair of numbers is to be combined first.

Sample Set B

Example:
Multiply the whole numbers.

(8  3)  14 = 24  14 = 336
8  (3  14) = 8  42 = 336

Practice Set B
Use the associative property of multiplication to find the products in two ways.
Exercise:

   Problem:

   Solution:
   168
Exercise:
   Problem:
   Solution:
   165,564

The Multiplicative Identity

The Multiplicative Identity is 1
The whole number 1 is called the multiplicative identity, since any whole num­ber multiplied by 1 is not changed.

Sample Set C

Example:
Multiply the whole numbers.

12  1 = 12
1  12 = 12

Summary of Key Concepts
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module summarizes the concepts discussed in the
chapter "Multiplication and Division of Whole Numbers."

Summary of Key Concepts

Multiplication ([link])
Multiplication is a description of repeated addition.

7 +7 +7 +7

    

  7 appears 4 times

This expression is described by writing 4 X 7.

Multiplicand/Multiplier/Product ([link])
In a multiplication of whole numbers, the repeated addend is called the
multiplicand, and the number that records the number of times the
multiplicand is used is the multiplier. The result of the multiplication is the
product.

Factors ([link])
In a multiplication, the numbers being multiplied are also called factors.
Thus, the multiplicand and the multiplier can be called factors.

Division ([link])
Division is a description of repeated subtraction.

Dividend/Divisor/Quotient ([link])
In a division, the number divided into is called the dividend, and the
number dividing into the dividend is called the divisor. The result of the
division is called the quotient.

                      quotient

divisor dividend

Division into Zero ([link])
Zero divided by any nonzero whole number is zero.

Division by Zero ([link])
Division by zero does not name a whole number. It is, therefore, undefined.

The quotient  0  is indeterminant.
              0

Division by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 ([link])
Division by the whole numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 can be determined
by noting some certain properties of the particular whole number.

Commutative Property of Multiplication ([link])
The product of two whole numbers is the same regardless of the order of
the factors. 3 × 5 = 5 × 3

Associative Property of Multiplication ([link])
If three whole numbers are to be multiplied, the product will be the same if
the first two are multiplied first and then that product is multiplied by the
third, or if the second two are multiplied first and then that product is
multiplied by the first.

(3 × 5) × 2 = 3 × (5 × 2)

Note that the order of the factors is maintained.

Multiplicative Identity ([link])
The whole number 1 is called the multiplicative identity since any whole
number multiplied by 1 is not changed.

4×1 = 4

1×4 = 4

Exponential Notation

Exponential Notation
We have noted that multiplication is a description of repeated addition.
Exponen­tial notation is a description of repeated multiplication.

Suppose we have the repeated multiplication

88888

Exponent
The factor 8 is repeated 5 times. Exponential notation uses a superscript for
the number of times the factor is repeated. The superscript is placed on the
repeated factor, 8 5, in this case. The superscript is called an exponent.

The Function of an Exponent
An exponent records the number of identical factors that are repeated in a
multiplication.

Sample Set A
Write the following multiplication using exponents.

Example:
3  3. Since the factor 3 appears 2 times, we record this as

32

Example:
62  62  62  62  62  62  62  62  62. Since the factor 62 appears 9 times,
we record this as

          9

62

Expand (write without exponents) each number.

Example:
124. The exponent 4 is recording 4 factors of 12 in a multiplication. Thus,

          4

12 = 12  12  12  12

Example:
7063. The exponent 3 is recording 3 factors of 706 in a multiplication.
Thus,

              3

706 = 706  706  706

Reading Exponential Notation

In a number such as 85,

Base
8 is called the base.

Exponent, Power

5  is  called  the  exponent,  or    power.      5  is  read  as  "eight  to  the  fifth  power,"

                                             8

or more simply as "eight to the fifth," or "the fifth power of eight."

Squared
When a whole number is raised to the second power, it is said to be
squared. The number 52 can be read as

5 to the second power, or
5 to the second, or
5 squared.

Cubed

When a whole number is raised to the third power, it is said to be cubed.

The    number      3  can  be  read  as

               5

5 to the third power, or
5 to the third, or
5 cubed.
When a whole number is raised to the power of 4 or higher, we simply say
that that number is raised to that particular power. The number 58 can be
read as

5 to the eighth power, or just
5 to the eighth.

Roots

In the English language, the word "root" can mean a source of something.
In mathematical terms, the word "root" is used to indicate that one number
is the source of another number through repeated multiplication.

Square Root
We know that 49 = 72, that is, 49 = 7  7. Through repeated multiplication,
7 is the source of 49. Thus, 7 is a root of 49. Since two 7's must be
multiplied together to produce 49, the 7 is called the second or square root
of 49.

Cube Root
We know that 8 = 23, that is, 8 = 2  2  2. Through repeated
multiplication, 2 is the source of 8. Thus, 2 is a root of 8. Since three 2's
must be multiplied together to produce 8, 2 is called the third or cube root
of 8.

We can continue this way to see such roots as fourth roots, fifth roots, sixth
roots, and so on.

Reading Root Notation

There is a symbol used to indicate roots of a number. It is called the radical

sign    n

      

The   Radical  Sign    n

                     

The   symbol    n  is called a radical sign and indicates the nth root of a

              

number.
We discuss particular roots using the radical sign as follows:

Square Root

  2            indicates         the   square      root    of  the  number  under  the  radical  sign.

number

It is customary to drop the 2 in the radical sign when discussing square

roots. The symbol  is understood to be the square root radical sign.

49      =   7  since  7     7  =        2  =   49

                                    7

Cube Root

   3           indicates         the   cube      root  of  the  number  under  the  radical  sign.

number

   3  =    2   since  2     2    2  =      23  =   8

8

Fourth Root

   4           indicates         the   fourth      root  of    the  number  under  the  radical  sign.

number

   4    =   3  since     3    3    3       3  =  34   =  81

81

In  an  expression       such      as      5

                                        32

Radical Sign
 is called the radical sign.

Index
5 is called the index. (The index describes the indicated root.)

Radicand
32 is called the radicand.

Radical

   5    is  called    a  radical      (or     radical  expression).

32

Sample Set B
Find each root.

Example:
25 To determine the square root of 25, we ask, "What whole number
squared equals 25?" From our experience with multiplication, we know
this number to be 5. Thus,

25 = 5

Check: 5  5 = 52 = 25

Example:

   5  To  determine  the  fifth  root  of  32,  we  ask,  "What  whole  number  raised

32

to the fifth power equals 32?" This number is 2.

   5

32 = 2

Check: 2  2  2  2  2 = 25 = 32

Grouping Symbols and the Order of Operations
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis, Jr. This
module discusses grouping symbols and the order of operations. By the end of the module students
should be able to understand the use of grouping symbols, understand and be able to use the order of
operations and use the calculator to determine the value of a numerical expression.

Section Overview

      Grouping Symbols
      Multiple Grouping Symbols
      The Order of Operations
      Calculators

Grouping Symbols

Grouping symbols are used to indicate that a particular collection of numbers and meaningful
operations are to be grouped together and considered as one number. The grouping symbols
commonly used in mathematics are the following:

( ), [ ], { },
Parentheses: ( )
Brackets: [ ]
Braces: { }
Bar:

In a computation in which more than one operation is involved, grouping symbols indicate which
operation to perform first. If possible, we perform operations inside grouping symbols first.

Sample Set A
If possible, determine the value of each of the following.

Example:

9 + (3  8)

Since 3 and 8 are within parentheses, they are to be combined first.

9 + (3  8) = 9 + 24

       = 33

Thus,

9 + (3  8) = 33

Example:

(10÷0)  6

Since 10 ÷ 0 is undefined, this operation is meaningless, and we attach no value to it. We write,
"undefined."
Practice Set A
If possible, determine the value of each of the following.
Exercise:

   Problem: 16 - (3  2)
   Solution:
   10
Exercise:

   Problem: 5 + (7  9)
   Solution:

Exercise:

   Problem: 28÷(18 - 11)
   Solution:

Exercise:

   Problem: (33÷3) - 11
   Solution:
   0
Exercise:

   Problem: 4 + (0÷0)
   Solution:
   not possible (indeterminant)
Multiple Grouping Symbols

When a set of grouping symbols occurs inside another set of grouping symbols, we perform the
operations within the innermost set first.

Sample Set B
Determine the value of each of the following.

Example:

2 + (8  3) - (5 + 6)

Combine 8 and 3 first, then combine 5 and 6.

2 + 24 - 11 Now combine lef t to right.
26 - 11
15

Example:

10 + [30 - (2  9)]

Combine 2 and 9 since they occur in the innermost set of parentheses.

10 + [30 - 18] Now combine 30 and 18.
10 + 12
22

Practice Set B
Determine the value of each of the following.

The Order of Operations

Sometimes there are no grouping symbols indicating which operations to perform first. For example,
suppose we wish to find the value of 3 + 5  2. We could do either of two things:
Add 3 and 5, then multiply this sum by 2.

3 +5 2 = 8  2
                          = 16

Multiply 5 and 2, then add 3 to this product.

3 + 5  2 = 3 + 10
                          = 13

We now have two values for one number. To determine the correct value, we must use the accepted
order of operations.
Order of Operations
1. Perform all operations inside grouping symbols, beginning with the innermost set, in the order 2,
  3, 4 described below,

2. Perform all exponential and root operations.
3. Perform all multiplications and divisions, moving left to right.
4. Perform all additions and subtractions, moving left to right.

Sample Set C
Determine the value of each of the following.

Example:     Multiply f irst.

21 + 3  12

21 + 36      Add.

57

Example:                Simplif y inside parentheses f irst.

(15 - 8) + 5  (6 + 4).

7 + 5  10               Multiply.

7 + 50                  Add.

57

Example:                   Simplif y f irst within the parenthesis by multiplying, then adding.

63 - (4 + 6  3 ) + 76 - 4

63 - (4 + 18) + 76 - 4

63 - 22 + 76 - 4           Now perf orm the additions and subtractions, moving lef t to right.

41 + 76 - 4                Add 41 and 76: 41 + 76 = 117.

117 - 4                    Subtract 4 f rom 117: 117 - 4 = 113.

113

Example:        Evaluate the exponential f orms, moving lef t to right.

7  6 - 42 + 15

7  6 - 16 + 1 Multiply 7 and 6: 7  6 = 42

42 - 16 + 1     Subtract 16 f rom 42: 42 - 16 = 26

26 + 1          Add 26 and 1: 26 + 1 = 27

27
Example:                 Evaluate the exponential f orms in the parentheses: 32 = 9 and 22 = 4
                         Add the 9 and 4 in the parentheses: 9 + 4 = 13
6  (32 + 22 ) + 42       Evaluate the exponential f orm: 42 = 16
6  (9 + 4) + 42
6  (13) + 42

6  (13) + 16             Multiply 6 and 13: 6  13 = 78

78 + 16                  Add 78 and 16: 78 + 16 = 94

94

Example:

  62 +22  +      13 +82  Recall that the bar is a grouping symbol.
42 +622
                     2

                         The f raction 2  2 is equivalent to(6 + 2 )÷(4 + 6  2 )
                         4 +62

This number is too big for the display of some calculators and we'll probably get some kind of error
message. On some scientific calculators such large numbers are coped with by placing them in a form
called "scientific notation." Others can do the multiplication directly. (1803416780)

Prime Factorization of Natural Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis, Jr. This
module discusses prime factorization of natural numbers. By the end of the module students should
be able to determine the factors of a whole number, distinguish between prime and composite
numbers, be familiar with the fundamental principle of arithmetic and find the prime factorization
of a whole number.

Section Overview

      Factors

      The Prime Factorization of a Natural Number

Factors

From observations made in the process of multiplication, we have seen that

(f actor)  (f actor) = product

Factors, Product
The two numbers being multiplied are the factors and the result of the multiplication is the
product. Now, using our knowledge of division, we can see that a first number is a factor of a
second number if the first number divides into the second number a whole number of times
(without a remainder).

One Number as a Factor of Another
A first number is a factor of a second number if the first number divides into the second number a
whole number of times (without a remainder).

We show this in the following examples:

Example:
3 is a factor of 27, since 27÷3 = 9, or 3  9 = 27.

Example:
7 is a factor of 56, since 56÷7 = 8, or 7  8 = 56.

Example:
4 is not a factor of 10, since 10÷4 = 2R2. (There is a remainder.)
Determining the Factors of a Whole Number

We can use the tests for divisibility from [link] to determine all the factors of a whole number.

Sample Set A

Example:                                                              1 and 24 are f actors
Find all the factors of 24.

Try 1: 24÷1 = 24

Try 2: 24 is even, so 24 is divisible by 2.

24÷2 = 12                                                             2 and 12 are f actors

Try 3: 2 + 4 = 6 and 6 is divisible by 3, so 24 is divisible by 3.

24÷3 = 8                                                              3 and 8 are f actors

Try 4: 24÷4 = 6                                                       4 and 6 are f actors

Try 5: 24÷5 = 4R4                                                     5 is not a f actor.

The next number to try is 6, but we already have that 6 is a factor. Once we come upon a factor

that we already have discovered, we can stop.

All the whole number factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

Prime and Composite Numbers

Notice that the only factors of 7 are 1 and 7 itself, and that the only factors of 3 are 1 and 3 itself.
However, the number 8 has the factors 1, 2, 4, and 8, and the number 10 has the factors 1, 2, 5, and
10. Thus, we can see that a whole number can have only two factors (itself and 1) and another
whole number can have several factors.
We can use this observation to make a useful classification for whole numbers: prime numbers and
composite numbers.
Prime Number
A whole number (greater than one) whose only factors are itself and 1 is called a prime number.
The Number 1 is Not a Prime Number
The first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. Notice that the whole number 1 is not
considered to be a prime number, and the whole number 2 is the first prime and the only even
prime number.
Composite Number
A whole number composed of factors other than itself and 1 is called a composi­te number.
Composite numbers are not prime numbers.
Some composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 15.

Sample Set B
Determine which whole numbers are prime and which are composite.

Example:
39. Since 3 divides into 39, the number 39 is composite: 39 ÷ 3 = 13

Example:
47. A few division trials will assure us that 47 is only divisible by 1 and 47. Therefore, 47 is
prime.

The Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic
Prime numbers are very useful in the study of mathematics. We will see how they are used in
subsequent sections. We now state the Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic.

Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic
Except for the order of the factors, every natural number other than 1 can be factored in one and
only one way as a product of prime numbers.

Prime Factorization
When a number is factored so that all its factors are prime numbers. the factoriz­ ation is called the
prime factorization of the number.

The technique of prime factorization is illustrated in the following three examples.

   1. 10 = 5  2. Both 2 and 5 are primes. Therefore, 2  5 is the prime factorization of 10.
   2. 11. The number 11 is a prime number. Prime factorization applies only to composite numbers.

      Thus, 11 has no prime factorization.
   3. 60 = 2  30. The number 30 is not prime: 30 = 2  15.

60 = 2  2  15

The number 15 is not prime: 15 = 3  5

60 = 2  2  3  5

We'll use exponents.

60 = 22  3  5

The  numbers  2,  3,  and  5  are  each  prime.  Therefore,      2    3    5  is  the  prime  factorization  of  60.

                                                             2

The Prime Factorization of a Natural Number

The following method provides a way of finding the prime factorization of a natural number.
The Method of Finding the Prime Factorization of a Natural Number

   1. Divide the number repeatedly by the smallest prime number that will divide into it a whole
      number of times (without a remainder).

   2. When the prime number used in step 1 no longer divides into the given number without a
      remainder, repeat the division process with the next largest prime that divides the given
      number.

   3. Continue this process until the quotient is smaller than the divisor.
   4. The prime factorization of the given number is the product of all these prime divisors. If the

      number has no prime divisors, it is a prime number.

We may be able to use some of the tests for divisibility we studied in [link] to help find the primes
that divide the given number.

Sample Set C
Example:
Find the prime factorization of 60.
Since the last digit of 60 is 0, which is even, 60 is divisible by 2. We will repeatedly divide by 2
until we no longer can. We shall divide as follows:

30 is divisible by 2 again.
15 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3, the next prime.
5 is not divisble by 3, but it is divisible by 5, the next prime.

The quotient 1 is finally smaller than the divisor 5, and the prime factorization of 60 is the product
of these prime divisors.

60 = 2  2  3  5

We use exponents when possible.

60 = 22  3  5

Example:
Find the prime factorization of 441.
441 is not divisible by 2 since its last digit is not divisible by 2.
441 is divisible by 3 since 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 and 9 is divisible by 3.

147 is divisible by3(1 + 4 + 7 = 12).
49 is not divisible by 3, nor is it divisible by 5. It is divisible by 7.

The quotient 1 is finally smaller than the divisor 7, and the prime factorization of 441 is the
product of these prime divisors.

441 = 3  3  7  7

Use exponents.

441 = 32  72

Example:
Find the prime factorization of 31.
31 is not divisible by 2 Its last digit is not even
                                                                 31 ÷ 2 = 15R1
                                                                 The quotient, 15, is larger than the divisor, 3. Continue.

31 is not divisible by 3 The digits 3 + 1 = 4, and 4 is not divisible by 3.
                                                                 31 ÷ 3 = 10R1
                                                                 The quotient, 10, is larger than the divisor, 3. Continue.

31 is not divisible by 5 The last digit of 31 is not 0 or 5.
                                                                 31 ÷ 5 = 6 R1
                                                                 The quotient, 6, is larger than the divisor, 5. Continue.

31 is not divisible by 7. Divide by 7.
                                                                 31 ÷ 7 = 4R1
                                                                 The quotient, 4, is smaller than the divisor, 7.
                                                                 We can stop the process and conclude that 31 is a prime number.

The Greatest Common Factor
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses the greatest common factor. By
the end of the module students should be able to find the greatest common
factor of two or more whole numbers.

Section Overview

      The Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
      A Method for Determining the Greatest Common Factor

The Greatest Common Factor (GCF)

Using the method we studied in [link], we could obtain the prime factoriza-­
tions of 30 and 42.

30 = 2  3  5

42 = 2  3  7

Common Factor
We notice that 2 appears as a factor in both numbers, that is, 2 is a common
factor of 30 and 42. We also notice that 3 appears as a factor in both
numbers. Three is also a common factor of 30 and 42.

When considering two or more numbers, it is often useful to know if there
is a largest common factor of the numbers, and if so, what that number is.
The largest common factor of two or more whole numbers is called the
greatest common factor, and is abbreviated by GCF. The greatest
common factor of a collection of whole numbers is useful in working with
fractions (which we will do in [link]).

A Method for Determining the Greatest Common Factor

A straightforward method for determining the GCF of two or more whole
numbers makes use of both the prime factorization of the numbers and
exponents.

Finding the GCF
To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more whole
numbers:

   1. Write the prime factorization of each number, using exponents on
      repeated factors.

   2. Write each base that is common to each of the numbers.
   3. To each base listed in step 2, attach the smallest exponent that appears

      on it in either of the prime factorizations.
   4. The GCF is the product of the numbers found in step 3.

Sample Set A

Find the GCF of the following numbers.

Example:
12 and 18

            12 = 2  6 = 2  2  3 = 22  3

   1.

            18 = 2  9 = 2  3  3 = 2  32

   2. The common bases are 2 and 3.
   3. The smallest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime

      factorizations are, respectively, 1 and 1 ( 21and 31), or 2 and 3.
   4. The GCF is the product of these numbers.

            23 = 6

The GCF of 30 and 42 is 6 because 6 is the largest number that divides
both 30 and 42 without a remainder.
Example:
18, 60, and 72

     18 = 2  9 = 2  3  3 = 2  32

1. 60 = 2  30 = 2  2  15 = 2  2  3  5 = 22  3  5

     72 = 2  36 = 2  2  18 = 2  2  2  9 = 2  2  2  3  3 = 23  32

2. The common bases are 2 and 3.

3. The smallest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime
  factorizations are, respectively, 1 and 1:

21 from 18

    1  from  60

3

4. The GCF is the product of these numbers.

GCF is 2  3 = 6

Thus, 6 is the largest number that divides 18, 60, and 72 without a
remainder.

Example:
700, 1,880, and 6,160
700 = 2  350 = 2  2  175 = 2  2  5  35

                                             = 225 5 7
                                             = 22  52  7

1,880 = 2  940 = 2  2  470 = 2  2  2  235

                                                                                                        = 2  2  2  5  47

1. = 2 3  5  47

6,160 = 2  3,080 = 2  2  1,540 = 2  2  2  770

                                             = 2  2  2  2  385

                                             = 2  2  2  2  5  77

                                             = 2  2  2  2  5  7  11
                                             = 2 4  5  7  11

2. The common bases are 2 and 5

3. The smallest exponents appearing on 2 and 5 in the prime
  factorizations are, respectively, 2 and 1.

22 from 700.

    1  from  either  1,880  or  6,160.

5

4. The GCF is the product of these numbers.

GCF is 22  5 = 4  5 = 20

Thus, 20 is the largest number that divides 700, 1,880, and 6,160 without a
remainder.

Multiples

When a whole number is multiplied by other whole numbers, with the
exception of zero, the resulting products are called multiples of the given
whole number. Note that any whole number is a multiple of itself.

Common Multiples

There will be times when we are given two or more whole numbers and we
will need to know if there are any multiples that are common to each of them.
If there are, we will need to know what they are. For example, some of the
multiples that are common to 2 and 3 are 6, 12, and 18.

Sample Set B

Example:
We can visualize common multiples using the number line.

Notice that the common multiples can be divided by both whole numbers.

The Least Common Multiple (LCM)

Notice that in our number line visualization of common multiples (above), the
first common multiple is also the smallest, or least common multiple,
abbreviated by LCM.

Least Common Multiple
The least common multiple, LCM, of two or more whole numbers is the
smallest whole number that each of the given numbers will divide into without
a remainder.

The least common multiple will be extremely useful in working with fractions
([link]).

Finding the Least Common Multiple

Finding the LCM
To find the LCM of two or more numbers:

   1. Write the prime factorization of each number, using exponents on
      repeated factors.

   2. Write each base that appears in each of the prime factorizations.
   3. To each base, attach the largest exponent that appears on it in the prime

      factorizations.
   4. The LCM is the product of the numbers found in step 3.

There are some major differences between using the processes for obtaining
the GCF and the LCM that we must note carefully:
The Difference Between the Processes for Obtaining the GCF and the
LCM

   1. Notice the difference between step 2 for the LCM and step 2 for the GCF.
      For the GCF, we use only the bases that are common in the prime
      factorizations, whereas for the LCM, we use each base that appears in the
      prime factorizations.

   2. Notice the difference between step 3 for the LCM and step 3 for the GCF.
      For the GCF, we attach the smallest exponents to the common bases,
      whereas for the LCM, we attach the largest exponents to the bases.
Sample Set C
Find the LCM of the following numbers.

Example:
9 and 12

     9 = 3  3 = 32

1.

     12 = 2  6 = 2  2  3 = 22  3

2. The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2 and 3.
3. The largest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime factorizations

  are, respectively, 2 and 2:

22 from 12.

    2  from  9.

3

4. The LCM is the product of these numbers.

LCM = 22  32 = 4  9 = 36

Thus, 36 is the smallest number that both 9 and 12 divide into without
remainders.

Example:
90 and 630

1.         = 2  45 = 2  3  15 = 2  3  3  5 = 2  3 2  5

       90

630 = 2  315 = 2  3  105 = 2  3  3  35                  = 23357

                                                                                                                                             = 2  32  5  7

2. The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
3. The largest exponents that appear on 2, 3, 5, and 7 are, respectively, 1, 2,

  1, and 1:

           21 from either 90 or 630.
32 from either 90 or 630.

    1  from       either  90  or  630.

5

    1  from       630.

7

4. The LCM is the product of these numbers.

LCM = 2  32  5  7 = 2  9  5  7 = 630

Thus, 630 is the smallest number that both 90 and 630 divide into with no
remainders.

Example:
33, 110, and 484

33 = 3  11

1. 110 = 2  55 = 2  5  11

                                             2  2
484 = 2  242 = 2  2  121 = 2  2  11  11 = 2  11 .

2. The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2, 3, 5, and 11.

3. The largest exponents that appear on 2, 3, 5, and 11 are, respectively, 2,

1, 1, and 2:

    2  from       484.

2

    1  from       33.

3

51 from 110

112 from 484.

4. The LCM is the product of these numbers.

                  2               2
LCM = 2  3  5  11

       = 4  3  5  121

       = 7260

Thus, 7260 is the smallest number that 33, 110, and 484 divide into
without remainders.

Summary of Key Concepts
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module reviews the key concepts from the chapter
"Exponents, Roots, Factorization of Whole Numbers."

Summary of Key Concepts

Exponential Notation ([link])
Exponential notation is a description of repeated multiplication.

Exponent ([link])
An exponent records the number of identical factors repeated in a
multiplication.

In a number such as 73,

Base ([link])
7 is called the base.

Exponent ([link])
3 is called the exponent, or power.

Power ([link])

    3  is  read  "seven  to  the  third  power,"  or  "seven  cubed."

7

Squared, Cubed ([link])
A number raised to the second power is often called squared. A number
raised to the third power is often called cubed.

Root ([link])
In mathematics, the word root is used to indicate that, through repeated
multipli­cation, one number is the source of another number.

The Radical Sign  ([link])

The symbol  is called a radical sign and indicates the square root of a

number.    The   symbol        n  represents the nth root.

                             
Radical, Index, Radicand ([link])

An  expression  such  as     4  is  called  a  radical  and  4  is  called  the  index.

                          16

The number 16 is called the radicand.

Grouping Symbols ([link])
Grouping symbols are used to indicate that a particular collection of
numbers and meaningful operations are to be grouped together and
considered as one number. The grouping symbols commonly used in
mathematics are

    Parentheses: ( )
    Brackets: [ ]
    Braces: { }
    Bar:

Order of Operations ([link])

1. Perform all operations inside grouping symbols, beginning with the
  innermost set, in the order of 2, 3, and 4 below.

2. Perform all exponential and root operations, moving left to right.
3. Perform all multiplications and division, moving left to right.
4. Perform all additions and subtractions, moving left to right.

One Number as the Factor of Another ([link])
A first number is a factor of a second number if the first number divides
into the second number a whole number of times.

Prime Number ([link])
A whole number greater than one whose only factors are itself and 1 is
called a prime number. The whole number 1 is not a prime number. The
whole number 2 is the first prime number and the only even prime number.

Composite Number ([link])
A whole number greater than one that is composed of factors other than
itself and 1 is called a composite number.

Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic ([link])
Except for the order of factors, every whole number other than 1 can be
written in one and only one way as a product of prime numbers.
Prime Factorization ([link])
The prime factorization of 45 is 3  3  5. The numbers that occur in this
factorizat­ion of 45 are each prime.
Determining the Prime Factorization of a Whole Number ([link])
There is a simple method, based on division by prime numbers, that
produces the prime factorization of a whole number. For example, we
determine the prime factorization of 132 as follows.

The prime factorization of 132 is 2  2  3  11 = 22  3  11.
Common Factor ([link])
A factor that occurs in each number of a group of numbers is called a
common factor. 3 is a common factor to the group 18, 6, and 45
Greatest Common Factor (GCF) ([link])
The largest common factor of a group of whole numbers is called the
greatest common factor. For example, to find the greatest common factor
of 12 and 20,

   1. Write the prime factorization of each number.

                                                                                         2

           12 = 2  2  3 = 2  3

                                                                                                    2

           60 = 2  2  3  5 = 2  3  5

   2. Write each base that is common to each of the numbers:
      2 and 3
3. The smallest exponent appearing on 2 is 2.
  The smallest exponent appearing on 3 is 1.

4. The GCF of 12 and 60 is the product of the numbers 2 2 and 3.

             2

     2  3 = 4  3 = 12

Thus, 12 is the largest number that divides both 12 and 60 without a
remainder.

Finding the GCF ([link])
There is a simple method, based on prime factorization, that determines the
GCF of a group of whole numbers.

Multiple ([link])
When a whole number is multiplied by all other whole numbers, with the
exception of zero, the resulting individual products are called multiples of
that whole number. Some multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, and 28.

Common Multiples ([link])
Multiples that are common to a group of whole numbers are called
common multi­ples. Some common multiples of 6 and 9 are 18, 36, and 54.

The LCM ([link])
The least common multiple (LCM) of a group of whole numbers is the
smallest whole number that each of the given whole numbers divides into
without a re­mainder. The least common multiple of 9 and 6 is 18.

Finding the LCM ([link])
There is a simple method, based on prime factorization, that determines the
LCM of a group of whole numbers. For example, the least common
multiple of 28 and 72 is found in the following way.

1. Write the prime factorization of each number

                                                                         2

28 = 2  2  7 = 2  7

                                                                            3  2
72 = 2  2  2  3  3 = 2  3
2. Write each base that appears in each of the prime factorizations, 2, 3,
  and 7.

3. To each of the bases listed in step 2, attach the largest exponent that
  appears on it in the prime factorization.

  2 3 , 3 2 , and 7
4. The LCM is the product of the numbers found in step 3.

3  2
2  3  7 = 8  9  7 = 504

Thus, 504 is the smallest number that both 28 and 72 will divide into
without a remainder.

The Difference Between the GCF and the LCM ([link])
The GCF of two or more whole numbers is the largest number that divides
into each of the given whole numbers. The LCM of two or more whole
numbers is the smallest whole number that each of the given numbers
divides into without a remainder.

More Numbers on the Number Line

In Chapters [link], [link], and [link], we studied the whole numbers and
methods of combining them. We noted that we could visually display the
whole numbers by drawing a number line and placing closed circles at
whole number locations.

By observing this number line, we can see that the whole numbers do not
account for every point on the line. What numbers, if any, can be associated
with these points? In this section we will see that many of the points on the
number line, including the points already associated with whole numbers,
can be associated with numbers called fractions.

Fractions of Whole Numbers

The Nature of the Positive Fractions
We can extend our collection of numbers, which now contains only the
whole numbers, by including fractions of whole numbers. We can
determine the nature of these fractions using the number line.
If we place a pencil at some whole number and proceed to travel to the right
to the next whole number, we see that our journey can be broken into
different types of equal parts as shown in the following examples.

   a. 1 part.

   b. 2 equal parts.

   c. 3 equal parts.

   d. 4 equal parts.

The Latin Word Fractio
Notice that the number of parts, 2, 3, and 4, that we are breaking the
original quantity into is always a nonzero whole number. The idea of
breaking up a whole quantity gives us the word fraction. The word fraction
comes from the Latin word "fractio" which means a breaking, or fracture.
Suppose we break up the interval from some whole number to the next
whole number into five equal parts.

After starting to move from one whole number to the next, we decide to

stop after covering only two parts. We have covered 2 parts of 5 equal parts.

This situation is described by writing  2.

                                        5

Positive Fraction

                                            2

A number such as is called a positive fraction, or more simply, a

                                            5

fraction.

The Parts of a Fraction

A fraction has three parts.

   1. The fraction bar .

      Fraction Bar
      The fraction bar serves as a grouping symbol. It separates a quantity
      into individual groups. These groups have names, as noted in 2 and 3
      below.
   2. The nonzero number below the fraction bar.

      Denominator
      This number is called the denominator of the fraction, and it indicates
      the number of parts the whole quantity has been divided into. Notice
  that the denominator must be a nonzero whole number since the least
  number of parts any quantity can have is one.
3. The number above the fraction bar.

Numerator
This number is called the numerator of the fraction, and it indicates
how many of the specified parts are being considered. Notice that the
numerator can be any whole number (including zero) since any
number of the specified parts can be considered.

whole number               numerator

Sample Set A
The diagrams in the following problems are illustrations of fractions.

Example:                 The whole circle divided  1 of the 3
                             into 3 equal parts    equal parts
Diagrams A whole
                 circle

The fraction  1  is read as "one third."
              3
Example:          The whole rectangle divided into  3 of the 5
                              5 equal parts         equal parts
     A whole
    rectangle

The fraction   3  "is read as "three fifths."
               5

Example:

The number line between 0 and 1

The number line between 0 and 1 divided
              into 7 equal parts

                  6 of the 7 equal parts
The fraction  6  is read as "six sevenths."
              7

Reading and Writing Fractions
In order to properly translate fractions from word form to number form, or
from number form to word form, it is necessary to understand the use of the
hyphen.

Use of the Hyphen
One of the main uses of the hyphen is to tell the reader that two words not
ordinarily joined are to be taken in combination as a unit. Hyphens are
always used for numbers between and including 21 and 99 (except those
ending in zero).

Sample Set B

Write each fraction using whole numbers.

Example:

Fifty three-hundredths. The hyphen joins the words three and hundredths

and tells us to consider them as a single unit. Therefore,

fifty three-hundredths translates as   50
                                      300

Example:

Fifty-three hundredths. The hyphen joins the numbers fifty and three and

tells us to cons­ ider them as a single unit. Therefore,

fifty-three hundredths translates as   53
                                      100

Example:

Four hundred seven-thousandths. The hyphen joins the words seven and

thousandths and tells us to consider them as a single unit. Therefore,

four hundred seven-thousandths translates as    400
                                              7,000
Example:

Four hundred seven thousandths. The absence of hyphens indicates that the

words seven and thousandths are to be considered individually.

four hundred seven thousandths translates as   407
                                              1000

Write each fraction using words.

Example:

21  translates as twenty-one eighty-fifths.
85

Example:

  200  translates as two hundred three-thousandths. A hyphen is needed
3,000

between the words three and thousandths to tell the reader that these words

are to be considered as a single unit.

Example:

  203  translates as two hundred three thousandths.
1,000

Proper Fractions, Improper Fractions, and Mixed Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses proper fractions, improper
fractions, and mixed numbers. By the end of the module students should be
able to distinguish between proper fractions, improper fractions, and mixed
numbers, convert an improper fraction to a mixed number and convert a
mixed number to an improper fraction.

Section Overview

      Positive Proper Fractions
      Positive Improper Fractions
      Positive Mixed Numbers
      Relating Positive Improper Fractions and Positive Mixed Numbers
      Converting an Improper Fraction to a Mixed Number
      Converting a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction

Now that we know what positive fractions are, we consider three types of
positive fractions: proper fractions, improper fractions, and mixed numbers.

Positive Proper Fractions

Positive Proper Fraction
Fractions in which the whole number in the numerator is strictly less than
the whole number in the denominator are called positive proper fractions.
On the number line, proper fractions are located in the interval from 0 to 1.
Positive proper fractions are always less than one.

The closed circle at 0 indicates that 0 is included, while the open circle at 1
indicates that 1 is not included.

Some examples of positive proper fractions are
1 , 3 , 20 , and 106
2   5  27      255

Note that 1 < 2, 3 < 5, 20 < 27, and 106 < 225.

Positive Improper Fractions

Positive Improper Fractions
Fractions in which the whole number in the numerator is greater than or
equal to the whole number in the denominator are called positive improper
fractions. On the number line, improper fractions lie to the right of (and
including) 1. Positive improper fractions are always greater than or equal to
1.

Some examples of positive improper fractions are

3 , 8 , 4 , and 105
2   5  4       16

Note that 3  2, 8  5, 4  4, and 105  16.

Positive Mixed Numbers

Positive Mixed Numbers
A number of the form

nonzero whole number + proper f raction

is  called  a  positive  mixed  number.  For  example,  2  3  is a mixed number.
                                                           5

On the number line, mixed numbers are located in the interval to the right

of (and includ­ing) 1. Mixed numbers are always greater than or equal to 1.
Relating Positive Improper Fractions and Positive Mixed
Numbers

A relationship between improper fractions and mixed numbers is suggested
by two facts. The first is that improper fractions and mixed numbers are
located in the same interval on the number line. The second fact, that mixed
numbers are the sum of a natural number and a fraction, can be seen by
making the following observat­ions.

Divide a whole quantity into 3 equal parts.

Now, consider the following examples by observing the respective shaded
areas.

In the shaded region, there are 2 one thirds, or  2.

                                                  3

1       2

2( ) =  3
3

There are 3 one thirds, or  3 , or 1.

                            3

1       3  or 1
3( ) =

3       3
Thus,

  3

      =1

  3

Improper fraction = whole number.

There are 4 one thirds, or   4  ,  or  1  and  1.
                             3
                                               3

4( ) 1 = 4 or 1 and 1
   3      3            3

The terms 1 and  1  can be represented as 1 +      1  or 1 1
                 3                                 3                 3

Thus,

4 =11.
3      3

Improper fraction = mixed number.

There are 5 one thirds, or   5 , or 1 and      2.

                             3                 3

   1      5  or 1 and     2
5( ) =
   3      3               3
The terms 1 and    2  can be represented as 1 +  2  or 1 32 .
                   3                             3

Thus,

5 =12.
3        3

Improper fraction = mixed number.

There are 6 one thirds, or  6 , or 2.

                            3

   1        6  =2
6( ) =
   3        3

Thus,

6

     =2

3

Improper fraction = whole number.

The following important fact is illustrated in the preceding examples.

Mixed Number = Natural Number + Proper Fraction
Mixed numbers are the sum of a natural number and a proper fraction.
Mixed number = (natural number) + (proper fraction)

For example 1 3 1 can be expressed as 1 + 31 The fraction 5 87 can be
expressed as 5 + 8 7 .

It is important to note that a number such as 5 +   7  does not indicate
                                                    8

multiplication. To indicate multiplication, we would need to use a
multiplication symbol (such as )

Note:5 7 means 5 + 7 and not 5  7 , which means 5 times 7 or 5
         8                                   8     8   8

multiplied by        7.

                     8

Thus, mixed numbers may be represented by improper fractions, and
improper fractions may be represented by mixed numbers.

Converting Improper Fractions to Mixed Numbers

To understand how we might convert an improper fraction to a mixed

number, let's consider the fraction,               4.

                                                   3

4           1     1                       1     1

3  =        3  +  3                    +  3  +  3

                                    1
                                 1

   = 1+

                                 3
                       1

   =1

                      3

Thus, 4 = 1 1 .
      3           3

We can illustrate a procedure for converting an improper fraction to a mixed
number using this example. However, the conversion is more easily
accomplished by dividing the numerator by the denominator and using the
result to write the mixed number.

Converting an Improper Fraction to a Mixed Number
To convert an improper fraction to a mixed number, divide the numerator
by the denominator.

   1. The whole number part of the mixed number is the quotient.
   2. The fractional part of the mixed number is the remainder written over

      the divisor (the denominator of the improper fraction).

Sample Set A
Convert each improper fraction to its corresponding mixed number.

Example:

5  Divide 5 by 3.
3

The improper fraction 5 = 1 2 .
                        3  3

Example:
9 46 . Divide 46 by 9.
The improper fraction 46 = 5 1 .
                      9  9

Example:
83 . Divide 83 by 11.

 11

The improper fraction 11 = 7 11 83 6 .

Example:
104 Divide 104 by 4.

    4
104                     0  = 26
  4
     = 26

                        4

The improper fraction 104 = 26.
                                                                               4

Converting Mixed Numbers to Improper Fractions

To understand how to convert a mixed number to an improper fraction,
we'll recall
mixed number = (natural number) + (proper fraction)
and consider the following diagram.

Recall that multiplication describes repeated addition.

Notice that  5  can  be  obtained  from  1  2  using multiplication in the
             3                              3

following way.

Multiply: 3  1 = 3

Add: 3 + 2 = 5. Place the 5 over the 3:        5
                                               3

The procedure for converting a mixed number to an improper fraction is
illustrated in this example.

Converting a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction
To convert a mixed number to an improper fraction,

1. Multiply the denominator of the fractional part of the mixed number
  by the whole number part.

2. To this product, add the numerator of the fractional part.
3. Place this result over the denominator of the fractional part.

Sample Set B
Convert each mixed number to an improper fraction.

Example:

      7

5

      8

1. Multiply: 8  5 = 40.

2. Add: 40 + 7 = 47.

3. Place 47 over 8:  47 .

                      8

Thus, 5 7 = 47 .
8            8

Example:

          2

16

          3

1. Multiply: 3  16 = 48.
2. Add: 48 + 2 = 50.
3. Place 50 over 3: 3 50

Thus, 16 = 2 50

Equivalent Fractions, Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms, and Raising
Fractions to Higher Terms
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses equivalent fractions, reducing
fractions to lowest terms, and raising fractions to higher terms. By the end
of the module students should be able to recognize equivalent fractions,
reduce a fraction to lowest terms and be able to raise a fraction to higher
terms.

Section Overview

      Equivalent Fractions
      Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms
      Raising Fractions to Higher Terms

Equivalent Fractions

Let's examine the following two diagrams.

Notice that both  2  and  4  represent the same part of the whole, that is, they
                  3       6

represent the same number.

Equivalent Fractions
Fractions that have the same value are called equivalent fractions. Equiva­-
lent fractions may look different, but they are still the same point on the
number line.

There is an interesting property that equivalent fractions satisfy.
A Test for Equivalent Fractions Using the Cross Product
These pairs of products are called cross products.

If the cross products are equal, the fractions are equivalent. If the cross
products are not equal, the fractions are not equivalent.

Thus,   2  and   4     are equivalent, that is,    2  =  4.
        3        6                                 3
                                                         6

Sample Set A
Determine if the following pairs of fractions are equivalent.

Example:

3  and  6  .  Test  for  equality  of  the  cross  products.
4       8

The cross products are equals.
The fractions 4 3 and 8 6 are equivalent, so 4 = 8 3 6 .

Example:

3  and   9    .  Test  for  equality  of  the  cross  products.
8       16
The cross products are not equal.

The fractions     3  and   9  are not equivalent.

Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms

It is often very useful to convert one fraction to an equivalent fraction that

has reduced values in the numerator and denominator. We can suggest a

method for doing so by considering the equivalent fractions            9  and  3.
                                                                      15
                                                                               5

First, divide both the numerator and denominator of       9       by 3. The fractions
                                                         15

9 and 3 are equivalent.
15         5

(Can you prove this?) So,   9  =  3     .  We  wish  to  convert   9  to  53 . Now
                           15     5                               15

divide the numerator and denominator of         9    by 3, and see what happens.
                                               15

9÷3   =       3

15÷3          5

The fraction 15 9 is converted to 53 .
A natural question is "Why did we choose to divide by 3?" Notice that

9    =   33

15       53

We can see that the factor 3 is common to both the numerator and
denominator.

Reducing a Fraction
From these observations we can suggest the following method for
converting one fraction to an equivalent fraction that has reduced values in
the numerator and denominator. The method is called reducing a fraction.

A fraction can be reduced by dividing both the numerator and denominator
by the same nonzero whole number.

Consider the collection of equivalent fractions

5 , 4 , 3 , 2, 1
20   16    12      8   4

Reduced to Lowest Terms

Notice that each of the first four fractions can be reduced to the last

fraction,    1  ,  by  dividing  both  the  numerator  and  denominator  by,
             4

respectively, 5, 4, 3, and 2. When a fraction is converted to the fraction that

has the smallest numerator and denomin­ ator in its collection of equivalent

fractions, it is said to be reduced to lowest terms. The fractions            1,  3,  2,

                                                                              4   8   5

and   7  are all reduced to lowest terms.
     10

Observe a very important property of a fraction that has been reduced to
lowest terms. The only whole number that divides both the numerator and
denominator without a remainder is the number 1. When 1 is the only
whole number that divides two whole numbers, the two whole numbers are
said to be relatively prime.
Relatively Prime
A fraction is reduced to lowest terms if its numerator and denominator are
relatively prime.

Methods of Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms

Method 1: Dividing Out Common Primes

   1. Write the numerator and denominator as a product of primes.
   2. Divide the numerator and denominator by each of the common prime

      factors. We often indicate this division by drawing a slanted line
      through each divided out factor. This process is also called cancelling
      common factors.
   3. The product of the remaining factors in the numerator and the product
      of remaining factors of the denominator are relatively prime, and this
      fraction is reduced to lowest terms.

Sample Set B

Reduce each fraction to lowest terms.

Example:

       1     1

6 = = 2  3 1 1 and 3 are relatively prime.
18              3

Example:

        1       1  1

 56  =  = 13 2  2  2 7 7 7 and 13 are relatively prime (and also truly
104
        2  2  2 13

prime)

Example:

             1           1

315          3 35 7            15

336 = 2222 3  7  = 16 15 and 16 are relatively prime.

                      1     1

Example:

 8   =  222      No common prime factors, so 8 and 15 are relatively prime.

Method 2: Dividing Out Common Factors
   1. Mentally divide the numerator and the denominator by a factor that is
      com­mon to each. Write the quotient above the original number.

   2. Continue this process until the numerator and denominator are
      relatively prime.

25  .  5  divides  into  both  25  and  30.

Raising Fractions to Higher Terms

Equally as important as reducing fractions is raising fractions to higher
terms. Raising a fraction to higher terms is the process of constructing an
equivalent fraction that has higher values in the numerator and denominator
than the original fraction.

The fractions 5 3 and 15 9 are equivalent, that is, 5 = 15 3 9 . Notice also,

33     9

53  =  15

Notice that  3  = 1 and that  3  1 =  3  .  We  are  not  changing  the  value  of  3
             3                5       5                                             5

.

From these observations we can suggest the following method for
converting one fraction to an equivalent fraction that has higher values in
the numerator and denominator. This method is called raising a fraction to
higher terms.
Raising a Fraction to Higher Terms
A fraction can be raised to an equivalent fraction that has higher terms in
the numerator and denominator by multiplying both the numerator and
denominator by the same nonzero whole number.

The fraction     3   can be raised to  24  by multiplying both the numerator and
                 4                     32

denominator by 8.

Most often, we will want to convert a given fraction to an equivalent

fraction with a higher specified denominator. For example, we may wish to

convert    5  to an equivalent fraction that has denominator 32, that is,
           8

5      ?

8  =   32

This is possible to do because we know the process. We must multiply both

the numerator and denominator of           5  by the same nonzero whole number in
                                           8

order to 8 obtain an equivalent fraction.

We have some information. The denominator 8 was raised to 32 by
multiplying it by some nonzero whole number. Division will give us the
proper factor. Divide the original denominator into the new denominator.

32 ÷ 8 = 4

Now, multiply the numerator 5 by 4.

5  4 = 20

Thus,

5      54        20

8  =   84     =  32

So,
5  =  20

8     32

Sample Set D
Determine the missing numerator or denominator.

Example:

3  =   ?  .  Divide  the  original  denominator  into  the  new  denominator.
7     35

35÷7 = 5 The quotient is 5. Multiply the original numerator by 5.

7 = 75 = 35 3 35 15 The missing numerator is 15.

Example:

5  =  45  .  Divide  the  original  numerator  into  the  new  numerator.
6      ?

45÷5 = 9 The quotient is 9. Multiply the original denominator by 9.

6 = 69 = 54 5 59 45 The missing denominator is 45.

Multiplication of Fractions
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses multiplication of fractions. By the
end of the module students should be able to understand the concept of
multiplication of fractions, multiply one fraction by another, multiply mixed
numbers and find powers and roots of various fractions.

      Powers and Roots of Fractions

Fractions of Fractions

We know that a fraction represents a part of a whole quantity. For example,
two fifths of one unit can be represented by

2  of the whole is shaded.
5

A natural question is, what is a fractional part of a fractional quantity, or,

what is a fraction of a fraction? For example, what  2  of  1?
                                                     3
                                                            2

We can suggest an answer to this question by using a picture to examine         2
                                                                                3

of 21 .

First, let's represent  1.

                        2
1  of the whole is shaded.
2

Then divide each of the         1     parts into 3 equal parts.
                                2

Each part is      1  of the whole.
                  6

Now we'll take       2  of the     1  unit.
                     3             2

2 of 1 is 2 , which reduces to 1 .
3        2     6                         3

Multiplication of Fractions

Now we ask, what arithmetic operation (+, -, ×, ÷) will produce                2  from  2
                                                                               6        3

of 21 ?

Notice that, if in the fractions      2      and  1  ,  we  multiply  the  numerators
                                      3           2

together and the denominators together, we get precisely                   2.

                                                                           6

21          2

32  =       6

This reduces to      1  as before.
                     3
Using this observation, we can suggest the following:

   1. The Word "OF" Indicates Multiplication The word "of" translates
     to the arithmetic operation "times."

   2. The Method of Multiplying Fractions To multiply two or more
     fractions, multiply the numerators together and then multiply the
     denominators together. Reduce if necessary.

numerator 1          numerator 2           =     numerator 1          numerator 2

denominator 1        denominator 2               denominator 1        denominator 2

Sample Set A
Perform the following multiplications.

Example:

3      1  =  31                  3  Now, reduce.

4      6     46      =

                               24

     1

     3          1

=         =

     24         8

     8

Thus

3      1  =  1

4      6     8

This means that         3   of      1  is  1  ,  that  is,  3  of  1  of a unit is   1  of the original
                        4           6      8                4      6                 8

unit.

Example:

3   4. Write 4 as a fraction by writing                     4
8                                                           1

                                       3

3      4     34         12             12        3

8      1  =  81      =  8   =              =     2

                                       8

                                       2

3            3

8  4 =       2

This means that         3   of 4 whole units is             3  of one whole unit.

Multiplying Fractions by Dividing Out Common Factors

We have seen that to multiply two fractions together, we multiply
numerators together, then denominators together, then reduce to lowest
terms, if necessary. The reduction can be tedious if the numbers in the
fractions are large. For example,

9       10  =  910     =     90   =   45   =   15

16      21     1621          336      168      28

We avoid the process of reducing if we divide out common factors before
we multi­ply.

               3          5

9       10     9       10         35       15

16      21  =                =    87  =    56

               16      21

               8          7

Divide 3 into 9 and 21, and divide 2 into 10 and 16. The product is a
fraction that is reduced to lowest terms.

The Process of Multiplication by Dividing Out Common Factors
To multiply fractions by dividing out common factors, divide out factors
that are common to both a numerator and a denominator. The factor being
divided out can appear in any numerator and any denominator.

Division of Fractions
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses division of fractions. By the end
of the module students should be able to determine the reciprocal of a
number and divide one fraction by another.

Reciprocals

Reciprocals
Two numbers whose product is 1 are called reciprocals of each other.

Sample Set A
The following pairs of numbers are reciprocals.

Example:

   3  and     4

   4          3

3       4     =1

4       3

Example:

   7   and    16

   16            7

7       16    =1

16         7
Example:

   1  and  6

   6       1

1     6  =1

6     1

Notice that we can find the reciprocal of a nonzero number in fractional
form by inverting it (exchanging positions of the numerator and
denominator).

Dividing Fractions

Our concept of division is that it indicates how many times one quantity is
cont­ained in another quantity. For example, using the diagram we can see
that there are 6 one-thirds in 2.

There are 6 one-thirds in 2.

Since 2 contains six  1  's  we  express  this  as
                      3

Using these observations, we can suggest the following method for dividing
a number by a fraction.

Dividing One Fraction by Another Fraction
To divide a first fraction by a second, nonzero fraction, multiply the first
traction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.

Invert and Multiply
This method is commonly referred to as "invert the divisor and
multiply."

Sample Set B

Perform the following divisions.
Example:

1 ÷ 3 . The divisor is 3 . Its reciprocal is 4 . Multiply 1 by 4 .
3             4                             4                     3             3      3

Applications Involving Fractions
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses applications involving fractions.
By the end of the module students should be able to solve missing product
statements and solve missing factor statements.

      Missing Factor Statements

Multiplication Statements

Statement, Multiplication Statement
A statement is a sentence that is either true or false. A mathematical
statement of the form

product = (factor 1)  (factor 2)

is a multiplication statement. Depending on the numbers that are used, it
can be either true or false.

Omitting exactly one of the three numbers in the statement will produce
exactly one of the following three problems. For convenience, we'll
represent the omitted (or missing) number with the letter M (M for
Missing).

   1. M = (factor 1)  (factor 2) Missing product statement.
   2. M  (factor 2) = product Missing factor statement.
   3. (factor 1)  M = product Missing factor statement.

We are interested in developing and working with methods to determine the
missing number that makes the statement true. Fundamental to these
methods is the ability to translate two words to mathematical symbols. The
word
of translates to times
is translates to equals

Missing Products Statements

The equation M = 8  4 is a missing product statement. We can find the
value of M that makes this statement true by multiplying the known factors.

Missing product statements can be used to determine the answer to a
question such as, "What number is fraction 1 of fraction 2?

Sample Set A

Find  3     of  8  .  We  are    being  asked  the  question,  "What  number  is  3  of  8 ?"
      4         9                                                                 4
                                                                                         9

We must translate from words to mathematical symbols.

         1         2

         3         8         12     2

M=                    =          =

         4         9         13     3

         1         3

Thus, 3 of 8 is 2 .
         4         9      3
               6

    3          24        36        18

M=                    =         =      = 18

    4          1         11         1

    1

Thus, 18 is    3   of 24.

Missing Factor Statements
The equation 8  M = 32 is a missing factor statement. We can find the
value of M that makes this statement true by dividing (since we know that
32 ÷ 8 = 4).

Finding the Missing Factor
To find the missing factor in a missing factor statement, divide the product
by the known factor.
missing factor = (product) ÷ (known factor)

Missing factor statements can be used to answer such questions as

1.  3  of what number is  9?
    8
                          4

2. What part of 1 7 2 is 1 14 13 ?

Sample Set B

Now, using
missing factor = (product) ÷ (known factor)
We get
                                3     2

        9     3     9     8     9     8

M=      4  ÷  8  =  4     3  =      

                             =  4     3
                             =
                                1     1

                                32
                                11

                                6

Thus,   3  of 6 is  9.
        8
                    4

For convenience, let's convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions.

   9       27

M  7    =  14

Now, using

missing factor = (product)÷(known factor)

we get
                                                3      1

    27           9     27      7     27                7

M=            ÷     =             =                

    14           7     14      9     14                9

                                                2      1

                                  =  31
                                     21

                                             3

                                  =

                                             2

Thus, 3 of 1 2 is 1 13 .

Summary of Key Concepts
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module reviews the key concepts from the chapter
"Introduction to Fractions and Multiplication and Division of Fractions."

Summary of Key Concepts

Fraction ([link])
The idea of breaking up a whole quantity into equal parts gives us the word
fraction.

Fraction Bar, Denominator, Numerator ([link])
A fraction has three parts:

   1. The fraction bar
   2. The nonzero whole number below the fraction bar is the denominator.
   3. The whole number above the fraction bar is the numerator.

Proper Fraction ([link])
Proper fractions are fractions in which the numerator is strictly less than
the denominator.

4  is a proper fraction
5

Improper Fraction ([link])
Improper fractions are fractions in which the numerator is greater than or
equal to the denominator. Also, any nonzero number placed over 1 is an
improper fraction.

45 , 55 , and 1 5 are improper fractions

Mixed Number ([link])
A mixed number is a number that is the sum of a whole number and a
proper fraction.

1 51 is a mixed number (1 5 1 = 1 + 5 ) 1

Correspondence Between Improper Fractions and Mixed Numbers
([link])
Each improper fraction corresponds to a particular mixed number, and each
mixed number corresponds to a particular improper fraction.

Converting an Improper Fraction to a Mixed Number ([link])
A method, based on division, converts an improper fraction to an equivalent
mixed number.

5  can   be  converted  to  1  1
4                              4

Converting a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction ([link])
A method, based on multiplication, converts a mixed number to an
equivalent improper fraction.

      7  can be converted to   47
                                8
5

      8

Equivalent Fractions ([link])
Fractions that represent the same quantity are equivalent fractions.

3  and   6   are equivalent fractions
4        8

Test for Equivalent Fractions ([link])
If the cross products of two fractions are equal, then the two fractions are
equivalent.

Thus,    3  and  6  are equivalent.
         4       8
Relatively Prime ([link])
Two whole numbers are relatively prime when 1 is the only number that
divides both of them.

3 and 4 are relatively prime

Reduced to Lowest Terms ([link])
A fraction is reduced to lowest terms if its numerator and denominator are
relatively prime.

The number      3  is reduced to lowest terms, since 3 and 4 are relatively
                4

prime.

The number      6  is not reduced to lowest terms since 6 and 8 are not
                8

relatively prime.

Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms ([link])
Two methods, one based on dividing out common primes and one based on
dividing out any common factors, are available for reducing a fraction to
lowest terms.

Raising Fractions to Higher Terms ([link])
A fraction can be raised to higher terms by multiplying both the numerator
and denominator by the same nonzero number.

3  =     32  =  6

4        42     8

The Word "OF" Means Multiplication ([link])
In many mathematical applications, the word "of" means multiplication.

Multiplication of Fractions ([link])
To multiply two or more fractions, multiply the numerators together and
multiply the denominators together. Reduce if possible.

5     4  =   54    =  20   =  1

8    15      815      120     6

Multiplying Fractions by Dividing Out Common Factors ([link])
Two or more fractions can be multiplied by first dividing out common
factors and then using the rule for multiplying fractions.

1      1

5      4      11       1

           =       =

8      15     23       6

2      3

Multiplication of Mixed Numbers ([link])
To perform a multiplication in which there are mixed numbers, first convert
each mixed number to an improper fraction, then multiply. This idea also
applies to division of mixed numbers.

Reciprocals ([link])
Two numbers whose product is 1 are reciprocals.

7 and  1   are reciprocals
       7

Division of Fractions ([link])
To divide one fraction by another fraction, multiply the dividend by the
reciprocal of the divisor.

4  ÷   2   =  4    15

5      15     5    2

Dividing 1 by a Fraction ([link])
When dividing 1 by a fraction, the quotient is the reciprocal of the fraction.

1      7
3=
       3

Multiplication Statements ([link])
A mathematical statement of the form

product = (factor 1) (factor 2)

is a multiplication statement.

By omitting one of the three numbers, one of three following problems
result:
   1. M = (factor 1)  (factor 2) Missing product statement.
   2. product = (factor 1)  M Missing factor statement.
   3. product = M  (factor 2) Missing factor statement.

Missing products are determined by simply multiplying the known factors.
Missing factors are determined by

missing factor = (product) ÷ (known factor)

Section Overview

      Addition of Fraction With Like Denominators
      Subtraction of Fractions With Like Denominators

Addition of Fraction With Like Denominators

Let's examine the following diagram.

2 one-fifths and 1 one fifth is shaded.

It is shown in the shaded regions of the diagram that

(2 one-fifths) + (1 one-fifth) = (3 one-fifths)

That is,

2     1      3

5  +  5   =  5

From this observation, we can suggest the following rule.

Method of Adding Fractions Having Like Denominators
To add two or more fractions that have the same denominators, add the
numer­ators and place the resulting sum over the common denominator.
Reduce, if necessary.
Sample Set A
Find the following sums.

Example:

3  +  2  .  The  denominators     are  the  same.  Add  the  numerators  and  place  that
7     7

sum over 7.

3  +  2     =  3+2  =  5

7     7          7     7

Example:

1  +  3  .  The  denominators     are  the  same.  Add  the  numerators  and  place  the
8     8

sum over 8. Reduce.

1  +  3     =  1+3  =  4   =  1

8     8          8     8      2

Example:

4  +  5  .  The  denominators     are  the  same.  Add  the  numerators  and  place  the
9     9

sum over 9.

4  +  5     =  4+5  =  9   =1

9     9          9     9

Example:

7  +  5  .  The  denominators     are  the  same.  Add  the  numerators  and  place  the
8     8

sum over 8.

7  +  5     =  7+5  =  12  =   3

8     8          8     8       2

Example:
To see what happens if we mistakenly add the denominators as well as the

numerators, let's add

1  +  1

2     2

Adding the numerators and mistakenly adding the denominators produces

1  +  1  =  1+1   =  2   =      1

2     2     2+2      4          2

This means that two      1  's  is  the  same  as  one  1  .  Preposterous!  We  do  not
                         2                              2

add denominators.

Solution:

43 + 4 3 = 4+4 3+3 = 8 6 = 4 3 , so two 43 's= one 43 which is preposterous.

Subtraction of Fractions With Like Denominators

We can picture the concept of subtraction of fractions in much the same
way we pictured addition.

From this observation, we can suggest the following rule for subtracting
fractions having like denominators:

Subtraction of Fractions with Like Denominators
To subtract two fractions that have like denominators, subtract the
numerators and place the resulting difference over the common
denominator. Reduce, if possible.
Sample Set B
Find the following differences.

Example:

3   -  1  .  The   denominators       are  the  same.  Subtract  the  numerators.  Place  the
5      5

difference over 5.

3   -  1     =     3-1   =  2

5      5           5        5

Example:

8   -  2  .  The   denominators       are  the  same.  Subtract  the  numerators.  Place  the
6      6

difference over 6.

8      2           8-2      6

6   -  6     =     6     =  6  =1

Example:

16  -  2     .  The   denominators    are  the  same.  Subtract  numerators  and   place
 9     9

the difference over 9.

16     2           16-2        14

9   -  9        =     9    =   9

Example:

To see what happens if we mistakenly subtract the denominators, let's

consider

7   -     4     =     7-4   =      3

15     15          15-15           0

We get division by zero, which is undefined. We do not subtract

denominators.

Addition and Subtraction of Fractions with Unlike Denominators
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis, Jr. This
module discusses how to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators. By the end of the module
students should be able to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators.

Section Overview

      A Basic Rule
      Addition and Subtraction of Fractions

A Basic Rule

There is a basic rule that must be followed when adding or subtracting fractions.
A Basic Rule
Fractions can only be added or subtracted conveniently if they have like denomin­ ators.
To see why this rule makes sense, let's consider the problem of adding a quarter and a dime.

1 quarter + 1 dime = 35 cents

Now,

                                                   25  same denominations

1 quarter =

                                                 100

                                          }

                                                   10

      1 dime =

                                                 100

        ¢ 35,  =   35
                  100

 25  +   10  =    25+10                                =   35
100     100          100                                  100

In order to combine a quarter and a dime to produce 35¢, we convert them to quantities of the same
denomination.

Same denomination  same denominator

Addition and Subtraction of Fractions

Least Common Multiple (LCM) and Least Common Denominator (LCD)
In [link], we examined the least common multiple (LCM) of a collection of numbers. If these numbers
are used as denominators of fractions, we call the least common multiple, the least common
denominator (LCD).

Method of Adding or Subtracting Fractions with Unlike Denominators
To add or subtract fractions having unlike denominators, convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction
having as a denominator the least common denominat­or ( LCD) of the original denominators.

Sample Set A
Find the following sums and differences.
Example:

1  +  3  .  The   denominators         are  not  the  same.  Find  the  LCD  of  6  and  4.
6     4

6 = 23

                     }The LCD = 22  3 = 4  3 = 12
  4 = 22

Write each of the original fractions as a new, equivalent fraction having the common denominat­or 12.

1  +  3     =      +

6     4        12              12

To find a new numerator, we divide the original denominator into the LCD. Since the original

denominator is being multiplied by this quotient, we must multiply the original numerator by this

quotient.

12 ÷ 6 = 2

12 ÷ 4 = 3

1     3            12              33
                   12              12
6  +  4     =                  +

                   2               9

            =      12          +   12  Now the denominators are the same.

            =      2+9                 Add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator.
                     12

                           11

            =

                           12

Example:

1  +  2  .  The   denominators         are  not  the  same.  Find  the  LCD  of  2  and  3.
2     3

LCD = 2  3 = 6

Write each of the original fractions as a new, equivalent fraction having the common denominator 6.

1  +  2     =      +

2     3        6               6

To find a new numerator, we divide the original denominator into the LCD. Since the original

denominator is being multiplied by this quotient, we must multiply the original numerator by this

quotient.

6 ÷ 2 = 3 Multiply the numerator 1 by 3.

6 ÷ 2 = 3 Multiply the numerator 2 by 2.

Addition and Subtraction of Mixed Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade
Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to add and subtract mixed numbers. By the end
of the module students should be able to add and subtract mixed numbers.

Section Overview

      The Method of Converting to Improper Fractions
To add or subtract mixed numbers, convert each mixed number to an improper
fraction, then add or subtract the resulting improper fractions.

Sample Set A
Find the following sums and differences.

Comparing Fractions
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to compare fractions. By the
end of the module students should be able to understand ordering of
numbers and be familiar with grouping symbols and compare two or more
fractions.

Section Overview

      Order and the Inequality Symbols
      Comparing Fractions

Order and the Inequality Symbols

Our number system is called an ordered number system because the
numbers in the system can be placed in order from smaller to larger. This is
easily seen on the number line.

On the number line, a number that appears to the right of another number is
larger than that other number. For example, 5 is greater than 2 because 5 is
located to the right of 2 on the number line. We may also say that 2 is less
than 5.

To make the inequality phrases "greater than" and "less than" more brief,
mathematicians represent them with the symbols > and <, respectively.

Symbols for Greater Than > and Less Than <
> represents the phrase "greater than."
< represents the phrase "less than."

5 > 2 represents "5 is greater than 2."
2 < 5 represents "2 is less than 5."

Comparing Fractions

Recall that the fraction     4  indicates that we have 4 of 5 parts of some whole
                             5

quantity, and the fraction      3  indicates that we have 3 of 5 parts. Since 4 of 5
                                5

parts is more than 3 of 5 parts,   4  is greater than  3     ;  that  is,
                                   5                   5

4   >  3

5      5

We have just observed that when two fractions have the same denominator,
we can determine which is larger by comparing the numerators.

Comparing Fractions
If two fractions have the same denominators, the fraction with the larger nu-­
merator is the larger fraction.

Thus, to compare the sizes of two or more fractions, we need only convert
each of them to equivalent fractions that have a common denominator. We
then compare the numerators. It is convenient if the common denominator
is the LCD. The fraction with the larger numerator is the larger fraction.

Sample Set A

Example:

Compare 8 and 14 .
               9         15

Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD as the

denominator. Find the LCD.

   9 = 32
                               }The LCD = 32  5 = 9  5 = 45

15 = 3  5

8   =  85     =   40

9      45         45

14  =     143     =  42

15        45         45
Since 40 < 42,

40       <  42

45          45

Thus 8 < 14 .
            9                 15

Example:

Write       5              7  , and   13  in order from smallest to largest.

               ,

            6 10                      15

Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD as the

denominator.

Find the LCD.

6 = 23

10 = 2  5 The LCD = 2  3  5 = 30

15 = 3  5

5        =  55             =     25

6           30                   30

7           73                    21

10       =     30          =      30

13       =  132               =   26

15             30                 30

Since 21 < 25 < 26,

< < 21      25                26

30          30                30

< < 7       5              13

10          6              15

Writing these numbers in order from smallest to largest, we get               7,  5,  13 .

                                                                              10  6   15

Example:

Compare 8 7 6 and 6 4 3 .

To compare mixed numbers that have different whole number parts, we

need only compare whole number parts. Since 6 < 8,

      3                 6

6        <8

      4                 7

Example:

Compare 4 5 and4 7
                              8       12
To compare mixed numbers that have the same whole number parts, we
need only compare fractional parts.

8 = 23                                                                                      3

                                   }The LCD = 2  3 = 8  3 = 24

12 = 22  3

5   =     53     =                 15

8         24                       24

7      =   72       =              14

12         24                      24

Since 14 < 15,

14     <   15

24         24

7      <   5

12         8

Hence, 4 7                                        5

Complex Fractions
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and
Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses complex fractions. By the end of the
module students should be able to distinguish between simple and complex
fractions and convert a complex fraction to a simple fraction.

Simple Fractions and Complex Fractions

Simple Fraction
A simple fraction is any fraction in which the numerator is any whole
number and the denominator is any nonzero whole number. Some examples
are the following:

1       4          763
                 1,000
     ,       ,

2       3

Complex Fraction
A complex fraction is any fraction in which the numerator and/or the
denomina­tor is a fraction; it is a fraction of fractions. Some examples of
complex fractions are the following:

3       1                   3
        3        6 4+ 8

Converting Complex Fractions to Simple Fractions

The goal here is to convert a complex fraction to a simple fraction. We can
do so by employing the methods of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and
dividing fractions. Recall from [link] that a fraction bar serves as a grouping
symbol separating the fractional quantity into two individual groups. We
proceed in simplifying a complex fraction to a simple fraction by simplifying
the numerator and the denomi­nator of the complex fraction separately. We
will simplify the numerator and denominator completely before removing the
fraction bar by dividing. This tech­nique is illustrated in problems 3, 4, 5, and
6 of [link].

Sample Set A
Convert each of the following complex fractions to a simple fraction.

Example:

Combinations of Operations with Fractions
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses combinations of operations with
fractions. By the end of the module students should gain a further
understanding of the order of operations.

Section Overview

      The Order of Operations

The Order of Operations

To determine the value of a quantity such as

1  +  5    2

2     8    15

where we have a combination of operations (more than one operation
occurs), we must use the accepted order of operations.
The Order of Operations:

   1. In the order (2), (3), (4) described below, perform all operations inside
     groupi­ng symbols: ( ), [ ], ( ), . Work from the innermost set to the

     outermost set.
   2. Perform exponential and root operations.
   3. Perform all multiplications and divisions moving left to right.
   4. Perform all additions and subtractions moving left to right.

Sample Set A
Determine the value of each of the following quantities.

Example:

1     5    2

4  +  8    15
   a. Multiply first.

                 1          1

       1         5           2          1         11           1         1

           +                    =          +            =         +

       4         8         15           4         43           4        12

                 4          3

   b. Now perform this addition. Find the LCD.

            4 = 22
                                  }The LCD = 22  3 = 12.

       12 = 22  3

       1   +     1              13      +      1     =     3   +     1

       4      12        =       12            12           12        12
                        =
                                3+1        =      4     =  1

                                12             12          3

       Thus, 1 + 5  2 = 1
                 4          8       15         3

Example:

3      9      5         1
   +       (-)
5      44     9         4

   a.  Operate      within      the     parentheses            first,    (  5  -  ) 1 .
                                                                            9
                                                                                  4

       9 = 32                                        2     2

                    }The LCD = 2  3 = 4  9 = 36.

       4 = 22

       54  -        19  =       20  -      9      =     20-9      =  11

       36           36          36         36           36           36

       Now we have

       3   +     9      11

       5      44    ()
                        36

   b. Perform the multiplication.
           1                       1

    3      9                       11          3           11        3                   1

        +                               =         +              =       +

    5      44                    36            5           44        5                   16

           4                       4

c. Now perform the addition. The LCD=80.

    3      1                       316         15           48           5                   48+5     53

    5   +  16                =     80   +        80     =   80   +       80              =   80    =  80

    Thus, 3 + ( 9 5 - ) 1 = 53
           5                     44     9         4              80

Example:

    15                          4          1                 1
8-        (2 - 1 )(3
                                               +2 )
    426                        15          5
                                                             8

a. Work within each set of parentheses individually.

                          4                 115+4                       19

    2-1                          =      2                   = 2-

                                 =
                                 =      30     -        19  =    30-19                   =   11
                                 =
                                 =      15              15           15                      15
                                 =
       1        1                       35+1                28+1
    3 +2                                      5         +         8

       5        8

                                        16              17

                                        5      +        8   LCD = 40

                                        168       +        175
                                          40                 40

                                        128       +     85

                                           40           40

                                        128+85
                                              40

                                        213
                                         40

    Now we have

    8-     15                11        213

                ( )(                          )

           426               15         40

b. Now multiply.
                 1                     1

              15             11        213              1111             11

   8-                                       = 8-                 = 8-

              426            15        40               2140             80

                 2            1

c. Now subtract.

            11            808          11       640     11       640-11         629        69

   8-       80      =        80     -  80   =   80   -  80    =      80      =  80   or 7  80

   Thus, 8 - (2 - 1 )(3 + 2 ) = 7 15 4 1 1 69
                          426               15       5        8          80

Example:

32 8 5

( )         -

      3 2 3 3 33 9
   ( )=                             =       =

      4                4         4     44       16

   Now we have

   9          8     -     5

   16         9           12

b. Perform the multiplication.

      9          8            5        11       5       1        5

                       -            =       -        =      -

   16            9            12       21       12      2        12

      2          1

c. Now perform the subtraction.

   1     -    5        =      6     -  5    =   6-5  =  1

   2          12             12        12       12      12

   Thus, ( )  - = 4 2 8 5 1
                    3            9     12       12

8     36              2         3

a. Begin by operating inside the parentheses.

   1         1           22+1            13+1           5                4

   2 -1      3     =         2     -              =     2          -     3
   2                                       3

                         15        8       15-8                    7

                   =     6      -  6   =       6     =             6

b. Now simplify the square root.

      25        5               5 2 25

          = (since( ) =                        )
      36        6               6          36

   Now we have

   7      5              28+7         5        23          5

   2+              =     8         +     =     8     +                   LCD = 56.
   8      7                           7                    7

                         237       58          161                 40

                   =     56     +  56    =     56    +             56

                   =     161+40    =     201                   33
                               56         56

   Thus, 2 7 +  25 ÷ (2 1 - 1 ) 1 = 3 33

Summary of Key Concepts
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module reviews the key concepts from the chapter
"Addition and Subtraction of Fractions, Comparing Fractions, and Complex
Fractions."

Summary of Key Concepts

Addition and Subtraction of Fractions with Like Denomi­nators ([link])
To add or subtract two fractions that have the same denominators, add or
subtract the numerators and place the resulting sum or difference over the
common denomi­nator. Reduce, if necessary. Do not add or subtract the
denominators.

1  +  5  =  1+5  =  6  =  3

8     8     8       8     4

Basic Rule for Adding and Subtracting Fractions ([link])
Fractions can be added or subtracted conveniently only if they have like
denomina­tors.

Addition and Subtraction of Fractions with Unlike Denominators
([link])
To add or subtract fractions having unlike denominators, convert each
fraction to an equivalent fraction having as denominator the LCD of the
original denominators.

Addition and Subtraction of Mixed Numbers ([link])
1. To add or subtract mixed numbers, convert each mixed number to an
improper fraction, then add or subtract the fractions.

Ordered Number System ([link])
Our number system is ordered because the numbers in the system can be
placed in order from smaller to larger.

Inequality Symbols ([link])
> represents the phrase "greater than."
< represents the phrase "less than."
Comparing Fractions ([link])
If two fractions have the same denominators, the fraction with the larger
numerat­or is the larger fraction.

5  >  3

8     8

Simple Fractions ([link])
A simple fraction is any fraction in which the numerator is any whole
number and the denominator is any nonzero whole number.

Complex Fractions ([link])
A complex fraction is any fraction in which the numerator and/or the
denominator is a fraction.

Complex fractions can be converted to simple fractions by employing the
methods of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractions.

      Reading Decimal Fractions
      Writing Decimal Fractions

Digits to the Right of the Ones Position

We began our study of arithmetic ([link]) by noting that our number system
is called a positional number system with base ten. We also noted that each
position has a particular value. We observed that each position has ten times
the value of the position to its right.

This means that each position has   1  the value of the position to its left.

Thus, a digit written to the right of the units position must have a value of

 1  of 1. Recalling that the word "of" translates to multiplication (), we can
10

see that the value of the first position to the right of the units digit is   1  of
                                                                             10

1, or

1   1 =        1

10          10

The value of the second position to the right of the units digit is      1  of   1,
                                                                        10
                                                                                 10

or

1      1            1              1
                                100
10     10   =             2  =

                  10

The value of the third position to the right of the units digit is   1  of    1 , or
                                                                    10
                                                                             100

1      1    =       1        =      1
                                1000
10     100                3

                  10

This pattern continues.

We can now see that if we were to write digits in positions to the right of
the units positions, those positions have values that are fractions. Not only
do the positions have fractional values, but the fractional values are all

powers of 10 (10,10 ,10 , ...) 2 3 .

Decimal Fractions

Decimal Point, Decimal
If we are to write numbers with digits appearing to the right of the units
digit, we must have a way of denoting where the whole number part ends
and the fractional part begins. Mathematicians denote the separation point
of the units digit and the tenths digit by writing a decimal point. The word
decimal comes from the Latin prefix "deci" which means ten, and we use it
because we use a base ten number system. Numbers written in this form are
called decimal fractions, or more simply, decimals.
Notice that decimal numbers have the suffix "th."

Decimal Fraction
A decimal fraction is a fraction in which the denominator is a power of 10.

The following numbers are examples of decimals.

1. 42.6

The 6 is in the tenths position.

                                              6

     42.6 = 42

                                             10

2. 9.8014

The 8 is in the tenths position.
The 0 is in the hundredths position.
The 1 is in the thousandths position.
The 4 is in the ten thousandths position.

                                                    8014

     9.8014 = 9

                                                 10,000

3. 0.93

The 9 is in the tenths position.
The 3 is in the hundredths position.

0.93 =    93
         100

Note:Quite often a zero is inserted in front of a decimal point (in the
units position) of a decimal fraction that has a value less than one.
This zero helps keep us from overlooking the decimal point.

4. 0.7

  The 7 is in the tenths position.

                                 7

     0.7 =

                                10

Note:We can insert zeros to the right of the right-most digit in a

decimal fraction without changing the value of the number.

7   = 0.7 = 0.70 =  70       =  7

10                  100         10

Reading Decimal Fractions

Reading a Decimal Fraction
To read a decimal fraction,

   1. Read the whole number part as usual. (If the whole number is less than
      1, omit steps 1 and 2.)

   2. Read the decimal point as the word "and."
   3. Read the number to the right of the decimal point as if it were a whole

      number.
   4. Say the name of the position of the last digit.

Sample Set A
Read the following numbers.

Example:
6.8

Note:Some people read this as "six point eight." This phrasing gets the
message across, but technically, "six and eight tenths" is the correct
phrasing.

Example:
14.116

Example:
0.0019

Example:
81
Eighty-one
In this problem, the indication is that any whole number is a decimal
fraction. Whole numbers are often called decimal numbers.

Converting a Decimal to a Fraction
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to covert a decimal to a
fraction. By the end of the module students should be able to convert an
ordinary decimal and a complex decimal to a fraction.

Converting an Ordinary Decimal to a Fraction

We can convert a decimal fraction to a fraction, essentially, by saying it in
words, then writing what we say. We may have to reduce that fraction.

Sample Set A
Convert each decimal fraction to a proper fraction or a mixed number.

Example:

Reading: six tenths               6.

                                  10

Reduce: 3 .
                               5

Example:
Reading: nine hundred three thousands  . 903

                                       1000

Example:

Reading:  eighteen  and  sixty-one  hundredths  18   61  .
                                                    100

Example:

Reading: five hundred eight and five ten thousandths 508 10,000 5 .
Reduce: 508 1 .

Converting A Complex Decimal to a Fraction

Complex Decimals

Numbers             such  as                             0.11  2    are called complex decimals. We can also convert
                                                               3

0.11

                 3

The  2              appears to occur in the thousands position, but it is referring to               2  of

a hundredth. So, we read 0.11 32 as "eleven and two-thirds hundredths."

Rounding Decimals
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to round decimals. By the
end of the module students should be able to round a decimal number to a
specified position.

Section Overview

      Rounding Decimal Numbers

Rounding Decimal Numbers

We first considered the concept of rounding numbers in [link] where our
concern with rounding was related to whole numbers only. With a few
minor changes, we can apply the same rules of rounding to decimals.

To round a decimal to a particular position:

   1. Mark the position of the round-off digit (with an arrow or check).
   2. Note whether the digit to the immediate right of the marked digit is

         a. less than 5. If so, leave the round-off digit unchanged.
         b. 5 or greater. If so, add 1 to the round-off digit.

   3. If the round-off digit is

         a. to the right of the decimal point, eliminate all the digits to its
            right.

         b. to the left of the decimal point, replace all the digits between it
            and the decimal point with zeros and eliminate the decimal point
            and all the decimal digits.

Sample Set A

Round each decimal to the specified position. (The numbers in parentheses
indicate which step is being used.)
Example:
Round 32.116 to the nearest hundredth.

      1

      2b The digit immediately to the right is 6, and 6 > 5, so we add 1 to
      the round-off digit:

           1+1 = 2

      3a The round-off digit is to the right of the decimal point, so we
      eliminate all digits to its right.
      32.12
The number 32.116 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 32.12.

Example:
Round 633.14216 to the nearest hundred.

      1

      2a The digit immediately to the right is 3, and 3 < 5 so we leave the
      round-off digit unchanged.
      3b The round-off digit is to the left of 0, so we replace all the digits
      between it and the decimal point with zeros and eliminate the decimal
      point and all the decimal digits.
      600
The number 633.14216 rounded to the nearest hundred is 600.
Example:
1,729.63 rounded to the nearest ten is 1,730.

Example:
1.0144 rounded to the nearest tenth is 1.0.

Example:
60.98 rounded to the nearest one is 61.

Sometimes we hear a phrase such as "round to three decimal places." This
phrase means that the round-off digit is the third decimal digit (the digit in
the thousandths position).

Example:
67.129 rounded to the second decimal place is 67.13.

Example:
67.129558 rounded to 3 decimal places is 67.130.

Addition and Subtraction of Decimals

The Logic Behind the Method

Consider the sum of 4.37 and 3.22. Changing each decimal to a fraction, we
have

       37                  22  Performing the addition, we get

4          +3

100        100

4.37 + 3.22 = 4                37   +3  22      4100+37     +   3100+22
                                                       100             100
                               100      100  =
                                             =
                                             =  437  +     322
                                             =  100        100
                                             =
                                                437+322
                                                      100

                                                759
                                                100

                                                       59

                                                7

                                                      100

                                             = seven and f if ty-nine hundredths

                                             = 7.59

Thus, 4.37 + 3.22 = 7.59.

The Method of Adding and Subtracting Decimals

When writing the previous addition, we could have written the numbers in
col­umns.
    4.37
+3.22

    7.59

This agrees with our previous result. From this observation, we can suggest
a method for adding and subtracting decimal numbers.
Method of Adding and Subtracting Decimals
To add or subtract decimals:

   1. Align the numbers vertically so that the decimal points line up under
      each other and the corresponding decimal positions are in the same
      column.

   2. Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers.
   3. Place a decimal point in the resulting sum or difference directly under

      the other decimal points.

Sample Set A
Find the following sums and differences.

Example:

9.813 + 2.140
     9.813 The decimal points are aligned in the same column.

 +2.140
 11.953

Example:

841.0056 + 47.016 + 19.058
  841.0056

     47.016

+19.058

To insure that the columns align properly, we can write a 0 in the position
at the end of the numbers 47.016 and 19.058 without changing their values.

Example:

1.314 - 0.58
     1.314

-0.58  Write a 0 in the thousandths position.

Example:

16.01 - 7.053
  16.01

-7.053 Write a 0 in the thousandths position.
Example:
Find the sum of 6.88106 and 3.5219 and round it to three decimal places.

     6.88106

+3.5219  Write a 0 in the ten thousandths position.

We need to round the sum to the thousandths position. Since the digit in the
position immediately to the right is 9, and 9>5, we get
10.403

Example:
Wendy has $643.12 in her checking account. She writes a check for
$16.92. How much is her new account balance?
To find the new account balance, we need to find the difference between
643.12 and 16.92. We will subtract 16.92 from 643.12.

After writing a check for $16.92, Wendy now has a balance of $626.20 in
her checking account.

Calculators

The calculator can be useful for finding sums and differences of decimal
numbers. However, calculators with an eight-digit display cannot be used
when working with decimal numbers that contain more than eight digits, or
when the sum results in more than eight digits. In practice, an eight-place
decimal will seldom be encoun­tered. There are some inexpensive
calculators that can handle 13 decimal places.

Sample Set B
Use a calculator to find each sum or difference.

Example:
42.0638 + 126.551

                                                     Display Reads
Type   42.0638               42.0638
Press  +                     42.0638
Type   126.551               126.551
Press  =                     168.6148

The sum is 168.6148.

Example:
Find the difference between 305.0627 and 14.29667.

Type   305.0627              Display Reads
Press  --                    305.0627
Type   14.29667              305.0627
Press  =                     14.29667
                             290.76603

The difference is 290.76603

Example:
51.07 + 3,891.001786
Since 3,891.001786 contains more than eight digits, we will be unable to
use an eight-digit display calculator to perform this addition. We can,
however, find the sum by hand.

       51.070000
3891.001786
3942.071786

The sum is 3,942.071786.

Multiplication of Decimals
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to multiply decimals. By the
end of the module students should understand the method used for
multiplying decimals, be able to multiply decimals, be able to simplify a
multiplication of a decimal by a power of 10 and understand how to use the
word "of" in multiplication.

      The Method of Multiplying Decimals
      Calculators
      Multiplying Decimals By Powers of 10
      Multiplication in Terms of "Of"

The Logic Behind the Method

Consider the product of 3.2 and 1.46. Changing each decimal to a fraction,
we have

(3.2)(1.46) = 3  2        1    46

                 10          100

   32                     146

=  10                     100

=  32146
   10100

=  4672
   1000

=         672

   4

         1000

= f our and six hundred seventy-two thousandths

= 4.672

Thus, (3.2)(1.46) = 4.672.

Notice that the factor
3.2 has 1 decimal place,

1.46 has 2 decimal places,   1+2 = 3
            and the product

4.672 has 3 decimal places.

Using this observation, we can suggest that the sum of the number of
decimal places in the factors equals the number of decimal places in the
product.

The Method of Multiplying Decimals

Method of Multiplying Decimals
To multiply decimals,

   1. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.
   2. Find the sum of the number of decimal places in the factors.
   3. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum found in step

      2.

Sample Set A
Find the following products.

Example:

6.5  4.3
Thus, 6.5  4.3 = 27.95.
Example:

23.4  1.96

Thus, 23.4  1.96 = 45.864.
Example:
Find the product of 0.251 and 0.00113 and round to three decimal places.

Now, rounding to three decimal places, we get

Calculators

Calculators can be used to find products of decimal numbers. However, a
calculator that has only an eight-digit display may not be able to handle
numbers or products that result in more than eight digits. But there are
plenty of inexpensive ($50 - $75) calculators with more than eight-digit
displays.

Sample Set B
Find the following products, if possible, using a calculator.

Example:

2.58  8.61

             Display Reads

Type   2.58  2.58
Press
Type   ×     2.58
Press
       8.61  8.61

       =     22.2138
The product is 22.2138.

Example:

0.006  0.0042

Type   .006              Display Reads
Press  ×                 .006
Type   .0042             .006
Press  =                 0.0042
                         0.0000252

We know that there will be seven decimal places in the product (since
3 + 4 = 7). Since the display shows 7 decimal places, we can assume the
product is correct. Thus, the product is 0.0000252.

Example:

0.0026  0.11976

Since we expect 4 + 5 = 9 decimal places in the product, we know that an
eight-digit display calculator will not be able to provide us with the exact
value. To obtain the exact value, we must use "hand technology." Suppose,
however, that we agree to round off this product to three decimal places.
We then need only four decimal places on the display.
Type   .0026   Display Reads
Press  ×       .0026
Type   .11976  .0026
Press  =       0.11976
               0.0003114

Rounding 0.0003114 to three decimal places we get 0.000. Thus,
0.0026  0.11976 = 0.000 to three decimal places.

Practice Set B
Use a calculator to find each product. If the calculator will not provide the
exact product, round the result to four decimal places.

Multiplying a Decimal by a Power of 10
To multiply a decimal by a power of 10, move the decimal place to the right
of its current position as many places as there are zeros in the power of 10.
Add zeros if necessary.

Sample Set C
Find the following products.

Example:
100  34.876. Since there are 2 zeros in 100, Move the decimal point in
34.876 two places to the right.

Example:
1,000  4.8058. Since there are 3 zeros in 1,000, move the decimal point in
4.8058 three places to the right.

Example:
10,000  56.82. Since there are 4 zeros in 10,000, move the decimal point
in 56.82 four places to the right. We will have to add two zeros in order to
obtain the four places.

Since there is no fractional part, we can drop the decimal point.

   Solution:

Multiplication in Terms of "Of"

Recalling that the word "of" translates to the arithmetic operation of
multiplica­tion, let's observe the following multiplications.

Sample Set D
Example:
Find 4.1 of 3.8.
Translating "of" to "×", we get

       4.1
  ×3.8

     328
  123
 15.58

Thus, 4.1 of 3.8 is 15.58.

Example:
Find 0.95 of the sum of 2.6 and 0.8.
We first find the sum of 2.6 and 0.8.

     2.6
+0.8

     3.4

Now find 0.95 of 3.4

        3.4
×0.95

       170
    306
  3.230

Thus, 0.95 of (2.6 + 0.8) is 3.230.

and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to divide decimals. By the
end of the module students should understand the method used for dividing
decimals, be able to divide a decimal number by a nonzero whole number
and by another, nonzero, decimal number and be able to simplify a division

The Logic Behind the Method

As we have done with addition, subtraction, and multiplication of decimals,
we will study a method of division of decimals by converting them to
fractions, then we will make a general rule.

We will proceed by using this example: Divide 196.8 by 6.

             4

We have, up to this point, divided 196.8 by 6 and have gotten a quotient of
32 with a remainder of 4. If we follow our intuition and bring down the .8,
we have the division 4.8 ÷ 6.
                                                  8

4.8÷6 = 4 ÷6

                                                10

   48               ÷  6

=

               10

Thus, 4.8 ÷ 6 = .8.

Now, our intuition and experience with division direct us to place the .8
immedi­ately to the right of 32.

From these observations, we suggest the following method of division.

A Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Nonzero Whole Number

Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Nonzero Whole Number
To divide a decimal by a nonzero whole number:

   1. Write a decimal point above the division line and directly over the
      decimal point of the dividend.

   2. Proceed to divide as if both numbers were whole numbers.
   3. If, in the quotient, the first nonzero digit occurs to the right of the

      decimal point, but not in the tenths position, place a zero in each
      position between the decimal point and the first nonzero digit of the
      quotient.
Sample Set A
Find the decimal representations of the following quotients.

Example:

114.1 ÷ 7 = 7
          16.3

7 114.1
          7
          44
          42
             2.1
             2.1
                  0

Thus, 114.1 ÷ 7 = 16.3.
Check: If 114.1 ÷ 7 = 16.3, then 7  16.3 should equal 114.1.

       4 2

    16.3
           7

 114.1 True.

Example:

0.02068 ÷ 4

Place zeros in the tenths and hundredths positions. (See Step 3.)
Thus, 0.02068 ÷ 4 = 0.00517.

A Method of Dividing a Decimal By a Nonzero Decimal

Now that we can divide decimals by nonzero whole numbers, we are in a
position to divide decimals by a nonzero decimal. We will do so by
converting a division by a decimal into a division by a whole number, a
process with which we are already familiar. We'll illustrate the method
using this example: Divide 4.32 by 1.8.

Let's   look  at  this     problem             as  4   32             ÷1 8 .
                                                      100                           10

4   32  ÷1  8        =               32
                     =
   100      10                4

                                    100
                                       8

                              1

                                     10

                                  432
                                  100
                                   18
                                   10

The divisor is       18    .  We          can  convert                18  into a whole number if we multiply it
                     10                                               10

by 10.

                              1

18              18         10

      10 =                          = 18
10 10 1

                  1

But, we know from our experience with fractions, that if we multiply the

denomina­tor of a fraction by a nonzero whole number, we must multiply the

numerator by that same nonzero whole number. Thus, when converting                      18
                                                                                        10

to a whole number by multiplying it by 10, we must also multiply the

numerator 432 by 10.
                                     100

                                 1

432               432            10                4321                   432
                                                    101                    10
         10 =                             =                           =

100               100            1

                     10

                                                                   2

                                          = 43

                                                                  10

                                          = 43.2

We have converted the division 4.32 ÷ 1.8 into the division 43.2 ÷ 18, that
is,
1.8 4.32  18 43.2

Notice what has occurred.

If we "move" the decimal point of the divisor one digit to the right, we must
also "move" the decimal point of the dividend one place to the right. The
word "move" actually indicates the process of multiplication by a power of
10.
Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Decimal Number
To divide a decimal by a nonzero decimal,

   1. Convert the divisor to a whole number by moving the decimal point to
      the position immediately to the right of the divisor's last digit.

   2. Move the decimal point of the dividend to the right the same number
      of digits it was moved in the divisor.

   3. Set the decimal point in the quotient by placing a decimal point
      directly above the newly located decimal point in the dividend.

   4. Divide as usual.

Sample Set B
Find the following quotients.

Example:

32.66 ÷ 7.1
7.1 32.66
      The divisor has one decimal place.
      Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 1 place to
      the right.
      Set the decimal point.
      Divide as usual.
Thus, 32.66 ÷ 7.1 = 4.6.
Check: 32.66 ÷ 7.1 = 4.6 if 4.6 × 7.1 = 32.66

      4.6
 ×7.1

       46
 322
32.66 True.

Example:

1.0773 ÷ 0.513

      The divisor has 3 decimal places.
      Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 3 places
      to the right.
      Set the decimal place and divide.
Thus, 1.0773 ÷ 0.513 = 2.1.
Checking by multiplying 2.1 and 0.513 will convince us that we have
obtained the correct result. (Try it.)

Example:

12 ÷ 0.00032
0.00032 12.00000

      The divisor has 5 decimal places.
      Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 5 places
      to the right. We will need to add 5 zeros to 12.
      Set the decimal place and divide.

This is now the same as the division of whole numbers.

                 37500.
 32 1200000.

             96
              240
             224

                 160
                160

                        000

Checking assures us that 12 ÷ 0.00032 = 37,500.

Calculators

Calculators can be useful for finding quotients of decimal numbers. As we
have seen with the other calculator operations, we can sometimes expect
only approximate results. We are alerted to approximate results when the
calculator display is filled with digits. We know it is possible that the
operation may produce more digits than the calculator has the ability to
show. For example, the multiplication

0.12345 × 0.4567

5 decimal   4 decimal
    places      places

produces 5 + 4 = 9 decimal places. An eight-digit display calculator only
has the ability to show eight digits, and an approximation results. The way
to recognize a possible approximation is illustrated in problem 3 of the next
sample set.

Sample Set C
Find each quotient using a calculator. If the result is an approximation,
round to five decimal places.

Example:

12.596 ÷ 4.7

Type   12.596        Display Reads
Press  ÷             12.596
Type   4.7           12.596
Press  =             4.7
                     2.68

Since the display is not filled, we expect this to be an accurate result.

Example:

0.5696376 ÷ 0.00123

                     Display Reads
Type               .5696376  0.5696376
Press              ÷         0.5696376
Type               .00123    0.00123
Press              =         463.12

Since the display is not filled, we expect this result to be accurate.

Example:

0.8215199 ÷ 4.113

Type               .8215199  Display Reads
Press              ÷         0.8215199
Type               4.113     0.8215199
Press              =         4.113
                             0.1997373

There are EIGHT DIGITS -- DISPLAY FILLED! BE AWARE OF
POSSIBLE APPROXI­MATIONS.
We can check for a possible approximation in the following way. Since the

                                    3

division 4 12 can be checked by multiplying 4 and 3, we can check our
division by performing the multiplication
4.113 × 0.1997373

3 decimal  7 decimal

places     places

This multiplication produces 3 + 7 = 10 decimal digits. But our suspected

quotient contains only 8 decimal digits. We conclude that the answer is an

approximation. Then, rounding to five decimal places, we get 0.19974.

Practice Set C

round to four decimal places.

Dividing Decimals By Powers of 10

In problems 4 and 5 of [link], we found the decimal representations of
8,162.41 ÷ 10 and 8,162.41 ÷ 100. Let's look at each of these again and
then, from these observations, make a general statement regarding division
of a decimal numb­ er by a power of 10.

             816.241
10 8162.410

          80
             16
             10
                62
                60
                   24
                   20
                      41
                      40
                         10
                         10
                            0

Thus, 8,162.41 ÷ 10 = 816.241.

Notice that the divisor 10 is composed of one 0 and that the quotient
816.241 can be obtained from the dividend 8,162.41 by moving the decimal
point one place to the left.
                   81.6241

             800

                   62 4
                   60 0
                      2 41
                      2 00
                          410
                          400
                              100
                             100
                                    0

Thus, 8,162.41 ÷ 100 = 81.6241.

Notice that the divisor 100 is composed of two 0's and that the quotient
81.6241 can be obtained from the dividend by moving the decimal point
two places to the left.

Using these observations, we can suggest the following method for dividing
decimal numbers by powers of 10.

Dividing a Decimal Fraction by a Power of 10
To divide a decimal fraction by a power of 10, move the decimal point of
the decimal fraction to the left as many places as there are zeros in the
power of 10. Add zeros if necessary.

Sample Set D

Find each quotient.

Example:
9,248.6 ÷ 100

Since there are 2 zeros in this power of 10, we move the decimal point 2
places to the left.

Example:

3.28 ÷ 10,000

Since there are 4 zeros in this power of 10, we move the decimal point 4
places to the left. To do so, we need to add three zeros.

Nonterminating Divisions
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses nonterminating divisions. By the
end of the module students should understand the meaning of a
nonterminating division and be able to recognize a nonterminating number
by its notation.

Section Overview

      Nonterminating Divisions
      Denoting Nonterminating Quotients

Nonterminating Divisions

Let's consider two divisions:
   1. 9.8 ÷ 3.5
   2. 4 ÷ 3

Terminating Divisions
Previously, we have considered divisions like example 1, which is an
example of a terminating division. A terminating division is a division in
which the quotient terminates after several divisions (the remainder is zero).

Exact Divisions
The quotient in this problem terminates in the tenths position. Terminating
divis­ ions are also called exact divisions.
Nonterminating Division
The division in example 2 is an example of a nonterminating division. A
non-terminating division is a division that, regardless of how far we carry
it out, always has a remainder.

Repeating Decimal
We can see that the pattern in the brace is repeated endlessly. Such a
decimal quotient is called a repeating decimal.

Denoting Nonterminating Quotients

We use three dots at the end of a number to indicate that a pattern repeats
itself endlessly.

4 ÷ 3 = 1.333 ...

Another way, aside from using three dots, of denoting an endlessly
repeating pattern is to write a bar ( ¯ ) above the repeating sequence of
digits.

4 ÷ 3 = 1.3

The bar indicates the repeated pattern of 3.
Repeating patterns in a division can be discovered in two ways:
   1. As the division process progresses, should the remainder ever be the
      same as the dividend, it can be concluded that the division is
      nonterminating and that the pattern in the quotient repeats. This fact is
      illustrated in [link] of [link].

   2. As the division process progresses, should the "product, difference"
      pattern ever repeat two consecutive times, it can be concluded that the
      division is nonter­minating and that the pattern in the quotient repeats.
      This fact is illustrated in [link] and 4 of [link].

Sample Set A

Carry out each division until the repeating pattern can be determined.

Example:

100 ÷ 27
                3.70370

27 100.00000
             81
              19 0
             18 9
                     100
                        81
                        190
                        189

When the remainder is identical to the dividend, the division is
nonterminating. This implies that the pattern in the quotient repeats.
100 ÷ 27 = 3.70370370 ... The repeating block is 703.

100 ÷ 27 = 3.703

Example:

1÷9
We see that this "product, difference"pattern repeats. We can conclude that
the division is nonterminating and that the quotient repeats.
1 ÷ 9 = 0.111 ... The repeating block is 1.

1 ÷ 9 = 0.1

Example:
Divide 2 by 11 and round to 3 decimal places.
Since we wish to round the quotient to three decimal places, we'll carry out
the division so that the quotient has four decimal places.

             .1818
11 2.0000

         1 1
              90
              88
                 20
                 11
                    90

The number .1818 rounded to three decimal places is .182. Thus, correct to
three decimal places,

2 ÷ 11 = 0.182

Example:
Divide 1 by 6.
We see that this "product, difference" pattern repeats. We can conclude that
the division is nonterminating and that the quotient repeats at the 6.

1 ÷ 6 = 0.16

determined.

Converting a Fraction to a Decimal
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to convert a fraction to a
decimal. By the end of the module students should be able to convert a
fraction to a decimal.

Now that we have studied and practiced dividing with decimals, we are also

able to convert a fraction to a decimal. To do so we need only recall that a

fraction bar can also be a division symbol. Thus,  3  not only means "3
                                                   4

objects out of 4," but can also mean "3 divided by 4."

Sample Set A

Convert the following fractions to decimals. If the division is
nonterminating, round to two decimal places.

Example:

3  .  Divide  3  by  4.
4

      .75

4 3.00
      2 8
           20
           20
              0

Thus, 43 = 0.75.

Example:

1  Divide 1 by 5.
5

      .2

5 1.0
      1.0
           0

Thus, 5 = 0.2 1
Example:

5  .  Divide                 5  by  6.
6

5     = 0.833  We are to round to two decimal places.
6

Thus,               5     = 0.83 to two decimal places.
                    6

Example:

5 81 . Note that 5 8 = 5 + 8 1 1 .

Convert                   1  to a decimal.
                          8

      .125

8 1.000

      8

      20

      16

                    40

                    40

                    0

1

     = .125

8

Thus, 5 1 = 5 + 1 = 5 + .125 = 5.125.
                       8                8

Example:

                 1  . This is a complex decimal.

0.16

                 4

Note that the 6 is in the hundredths position.

The number 0.16 4 1 is read as "sixteen and one-fourth hundredths."
                                            13

           1        164+1               65
1 4 4 16
                                        4   65    1       131     13

0.16 =          =                       = 100 =        =       =

4          100      100                     4     100     420     80

                                        1

                                                  20

Now, convert    13  to a decimal.
                80

   .1625

80 13.0000
            8 0
             5 00
            4 80
                 200
                 160
                    400
                    400
                          0

Thus, 0.16 1 = 0.1625.
                                     4

Combinations of Operations with Decimals and Fractions
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis, Jr. This
module discusses combinations of operations with decimals and fractions. By the end of the
module students should be able to combine operations with decimals.

Having considered operations with decimals and fractions, we now consider operat­ions that
involve both decimals and fractions.

Sample Set A

Perform the following operations.

Example:

0.38   1  .  Convert  both  numbers  to  decimals  or  both  numbers  to  fractions.  We'll  convert  to
       4

decimals.

   .25

4 1.00

    8

    20

    20

       0

To convert   1  to a decimal, divide 1 by 4.
             4

Now multiply 0.38 and .25.

1

4

.38

×.25

190

76

.0950

Thus, 0.38  1 = 0.095.
                                            4

In the problems that follow, the conversions from fraction to decimal, or decimal to fraction, and
some of the additions, subtraction, multiplications, and divisions will be left to you.

Example:
1.85 + 8  4.1 3 Convert 8 3 to a decimal.
1.85 + 0.375  4.1 Multiply before adding.
1.85 + 1.5375 Now add.
3.3875

Example:
5        4  - 0.28) Convert 0.28 to a fraction.

Summary of Key Concepts
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module reviews the key concepts from the chapter
"Decimals."

Summary of Key Concepts

Decimal Point ([link])
A decimal point is a point that separates the units digit from the tenths digit.

Decimal or Decimal Fraction ([link])
A decimal fraction is a fraction whose denominator is a power of ten.

Converting a Decimal to a Fraction ([link])
Decimals can be converted to fractions by saying the decimal number in
words, then writing what was said.

Rounding Decimals ([link])
Decimals are rounded in much the same way whole numbers are rounded.

Addition and Subtraction of Decimals ([link])
To add or subtract decimals,

   1. Align the numbers vertically so that the decimal points line up under
      each other and the corresponding decimal positions are in the same
      column.

   2. Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers.
   3. Place a decimal point in the resulting sum directly under the other

      decimal points.

Multiplication of Decimals ([link])
To multiply two decimals,

   1. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.
   2. Find the sum of the number of decimal places in the factors.
   3. The number of decimal places in the product is the number found in

      step 2.
Multiplying Decimals by Powers of 10 ([link])
To multiply a decimal by a power of 10, move the decimal point to the right
as many places as there are zeros in the power of ten. Add zeros if
necessary.

Division of a Decimal by a Decimal ([link])
To divide a decimal by a nonzero decimal,

   1. Convert the divisor to a whole number by moving the decimal point
      until it appears to the right of the divisor's last digit.

   2. Move the decimal point of the dividend to the right the same number
      of digits it was moved in the divisor.

   3. Proceed to divide.
   4. Locate the decimal in the answer by bringing it straight up from the

      dividend.

Dividing Decimals by Powers of 10 ([link])
To divide a decimal by a power of 10, move the decimal point to the left as
many places as there are zeros in the power of ten. Add zeros if necessary.

Terminating Divisions ([link])
A terminating division is a division in which the quotient terminates after
several divisions. Terminating divisions are also called exact divisions.

Nonterminating Divisions ([link])
A nonterminating division is a division that, regardless of how far it is
carried out, always has a remainder. Nonterminating divisions are also
called nonexact divis­ ions.

Converting Fractions to Decimals ([link])
A fraction can be converted to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the
denomin­ ator.

Ratios and Rates
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses ratios and rates. By the end of the
module students should be able to distinguish between denominate and pure
numbers and between ratios and rates.

Section Overview

      Denominate Numbers and Pure Numbers
      Ratios and Rates

Denominate Numbers and Pure Numbers

Denominate Numbers, Like and Unlike Denominate Numbers
It is often necessary or convenient to compare two quantities. Denominate
num­bers are numbers together with some specified unit. If the units being
compared are alike, the denominate numbers are called like denominate
numbers. If units are not alike, the numbers are called unlike denominate
numbers. Examples of denominate numbers are shown in the diagram:

Pure Numbers

Numbers that exist purely as numbers and do not represent amounts of

quantities are called pure numbers. Examples of pure numbers are 8, 254,

0, 21 5 ,            2  ,  and  0.07.
                  8  5

Numbers can be compared in two ways: subtraction and division.

Comparing Numbers by Subtraction and Division
Comparison of two numbers by subtraction indicates how much more
one number is than another.
Comparison by division indicates how many times larger or smaller one
number is than another.
Comparing Pure or Like Denominate Numbers by Subtraction
Numbers can be compared by subtraction if and only if they both are like
denominate numbers or both pure numbers.

Sample Set A

Example:
Compare 8 miles and 3 miles by subtraction.

8 mile - 3 miles = 5 miles

This means that 8 miles is 5 miles more than 3 miles.
Examples of use: I can now jog 8 miles whereas I used to jog only 3 miles.
So, I can now jog 5 miles more than I used to.

Example:
Compare 12 and 5 by subtraction.

12 - 5 = 7

This means that 12 is 7 more than 5.

Example:
Comparing 8 miles and 5 gallons by subtraction makes no sense.

8 miles - 5 gallons = ?

Example:
Compare 36 and 4 by division.

36 ÷ 4 = 9
This means that 36 is 9 times as large as 4. Recall that 36 ÷ 4 = 9 can be

expressed as  36  = 9.
               4

Example:

Compare 8 miles and 2 miles by division.

8 miles  =4
2 miles

This means that 8 miles is 4 times as large as 2 miles.

Example of use: I can jog 8 miles to your 2 miles. Or, for every 2 miles that

you jog, I jog 8. So, I jog 4 times as many miles as you jog.

Notice that when like quantities are being compared by division, we drop

the units. Another way of looking at this is that the units divide out

(cancel).

Example:

Compare 30 miles and 2 gallons by division.

30 miles   =  15 miles
2 gallons     1 gallon

Example of use: A particular car goes 30 miles on 2 gallons of gasoline.

This is the same as getting 15 miles to 1 gallon of gasoline.

Notice that when the quantities being compared by division are unlike

quantities, we do not drop the units.

Practice Set A

Make the following comparisons and interpret each one.
Exercise:

   Problem: Compare 10 diskettes to 2 diskettes by

      a. subtraction:
      b. division:
   Solution:
      a. 8 diskettes; 10 diskettes is 8 diskettes more than 2 diskettes.
      b. 5; 10 diskettes is 5 times as many diskettes as 2 diskettes.

Exercise:

   Problem: Compare, if possible, 16 bananas and 2 bags by
      a. subtraction:
      b. division:

Solution:

a. Comparison by subtraction makes no sense.

b. 16 bananas = 8 bananas , 8 bananas per bag.
          2 bags           bag

Ratios and Rates

Ratio
A comparison, by division, of two pure numbers or two like denominate
numbers is a ratio.

The comparison by division of the pure numbers  36           and the like
                                                 4

denominate numbers         8 miles  are examples of ratios.
                           2 miles

Rate
A comparison, by division, of two unlike denominate numbers is a rate.

The comparison by division of two unlike denominate numbers, such as

55 miles  and  40 dollars

1 gallon       5 tickets
are examples of rates.

Let's agree to represent two numbers (pure or denominate) with the letters a
and b. This means that we're letting a represent some number and b
represent some, perhaps different, number. With this agreement, we can
write the ratio of the two numbers a and b as

a or b
b  a

The ratio  a  is read as " a to b."
           b

The ratio  b  is read as " b to a."
           a

Since a ratio or a rate can be expressed as a fraction, it may be reducible.

Sample Set B

Example:

The ratio 30 to 2 can be expressed as  30  .  Reducing,  we  get  15 .
                                        2
                                                                   1

The ratio 30 to 2 is equivalent to the ratio 15 to 1.

Example:
The rate "4 televisions to 12 people" can be expressed as 12 people 4 televisions . The
meaning of this rate is that "for every 4 televisions, there are 12 people."
Reducing, we get 1 television . The meaning of this rate is that "for every 1

                                                                 3 people

television, there are 3 people."
Thus, the rate of "4 televisions to 12 people" is the same as the rate of "1
television to 3 people."

Proportions
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses proportions. By the end of the
module students should be able to describe proportions and find the missing
factor in a proportion and be able to work with proportions involving rates.

      Finding the Missing Factor in a Proportion
      Proportions Involving Rates

Ratios, Rates, and Proportions

Ratio, Rate
We have defined a ratio as a comparison, by division, of two pure numbers
or two like denominate numbers. We have defined a rate as a comparison,
by division, of two unlike denominate numbers.
Proportion
A proportion is a statement that two ratios or rates are equal. The
following two examples show how to read proportions.

Sample Set A
Write or read each proportion.
Example:

3   =  12

5      20

3 is to 5 as 12 is to 20

Example:

10 items   =   2 items
5 dollars      1 dollar

10 items is to 5 dollars as 2 items is to 1 dollar

Example:

8 is to 12 as 16 is to 24.

8   =  16

12     24

Example:

50 milligrams of vitamin C is to 1 tablet as 300 milligrams of vitamin C is

to 6 tablets.

50     300

1   =      6

Practice Set A
Write or read each proportion.
Exercise:

   Problem: 8 = 16 3 6

Finding the Missing Factor in a Proportion

Many practical problems can be solved by writing the given information as
propor­tions. Such proportions will be composed of three specified numbers
and one unknown number. It is customary to let a letter, such as x, represent
the unknown number. An example of such a proportion is

x  =   20

4      16

This proportion is read as " x is to 4 as 20 is to 16."

There is a method of solving these proportions that is based on the equality
of fractions. Recall that two fractions are equivalent if and only if their
cross products are equal. For example,

Notice that in a proportion that contains three specified numbers and a letter
representing an unknown quantity, that regardless of where the letter
appears, the following situation always occurs.

(number)  (letter) = (number)  (number)

                                             

We recognize this as a multiplication statement. Specifically, it is a missing
factor statement. (See [link] for a discussion of multiplication statements.)
For example,

x  =  20

4     16  means that 16  x = 4  20
          means that 4  20 = 16  x
4     16   means that 5  16 = 4  x
           means that 5  x = 4  20
x  =  20

5  =  x

4     16

5  =  20

4     x

Each of these statements is a multiplication statement. Specifically, each is
a missing factor statement. (The letter used here is x, whereas M was used
in [link].)

Finding the Missing Factor in a Proportion
The missing factor in a missing factor statement can be determined by
dividing the product by the known factor, that is, if x represents the missing
factor, then

x = (product) ÷ (known f actor)

Sample Set B
Find the unknown number in each proportion.
Example:

x  =   20  .  Find  the  cross  product.
4      16

16  x = 20  4

16  x = 80               Divide the product 80 by the known f actor 16.

   x   =      80

              16

   x   =5                The unknown number is 5.

This mean that      5    =  20  ,  or  5  is  to  4  as  20  is  to  16.
                    4       16

Example:

5  =   20  .  Find  the  cross  product.
x      16

5  16 = 20  x

   80  = 20  x Divide the product 80 by the known f actor 20.

   80

                =x

   20

   4   =x                The unknown number is 4.

This means that 4 = 16 5 20 , or, 5 is to 4 as 20 is to 6.

Example:
3 = x 16 64 Find the cross product.

16  x = 64  3

16  x = 192              Divide 192 by 16.

              192

   x   =      16

   x   = 12              The unknown number is 12.

The means that 3 = 12 16 64 , or, 16 is to 3 as 64 is to 12.

Example:
8 = 40 9 x Find the cross products.
9  40 = 8  x

360    = 8  x Divide 360 by 8.

 360   =x
    8
       =x     The unknown number is 45.

Proportions Involving Rates

Recall that a rate is a comparison, by division, of unlike denominate
numbers. We must be careful when setting up proportions that involve rates.
The form is import­ant. For example, if a rate involves two types of units,
say unit type 1 and unit type 2, we can write

or

Both cross products produce a statement of the type

(unit type 1)  (unit type 2) = (unit type 1)  (unit type 2)

which we take to mean the comparison
Examples of correctly expressed proportions are the following:

However, if we write the same type of units on different sides, such as,

unit type 1  =  unit type 2
unit type 2     unit type 1

the cross product produces a statement of the form

We can see that this is an incorrect comparison by observing the following
example: It is incorrect to write

2 hooks  =   6 poles
3 poles      4 hooks

for two reason.

1. The cross product is numerically wrong: (2  4  3  6).
2. The cross product produces the statement "hooks are to hooks as poles

  are to poles," which makes no sense.

Applications of Proportions
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses applications of proportions. By
the end of the module students should be able to solve proportion problems
using the five-step method.

Section Overview

      The Five-Step Method
      Problem Solving

The Five-Step Method

In [link] we noted that many practical problems can be solved by writing
the given information as proportions. Such proportions will be composed of
three specified numbers and one unknown number represented by a letter.

The first and most important part of solving a proportion problem is to
determ­ ine, by careful reading, what the unknown quantity is and to
represent it with some letter.

The Five-Step Method
The five-step method for solving proportion problems:

   1. By careful reading, determine what the unknown quantity is and
      represent it with some letter. There will be only one unknown in a
      problem.

   2. Identify the three specified numbers.
   3. Determine which comparisons are to be made and set up the

      proportion.
   4. Solve the proportion (using the methods of [link]).
   5. Interpret and write a conclusion in a sentence with the appropriate

      units of measure.

Step 1 is extremely important. Many problems go unsolved because time is
not taken to establish what quantity is to be found.
When solving an applied problem, always begin by determining the
unknown quantity and representing it with a letter.

Problem Solving

Sample Set A

Example:
On a map, 2 inches represents 25 miles. How many miles are represented
by 8 inches?

Step 1 The unknown quantity is miles.
Let x = number of miles represented by 8 inches
Step 2 The three specified numbers are
2 inches
25 miles
8 inches
Step 3 The comparisons are

2 inches to 25 miles  25 miles 2 inches
8 inches to x miles  x miles 8 inches
Proportions involving ratios and rates are more readily solved by
suspending the units while doing the computations.

2      8

25  =  x

Step 4 2         8

       25  =     x  Perf orm the cross multiplication.

2  x = 8  25

2  x = 200          Divide 200 by 2.

    x=     200
              2

       x = 100

In step 1, we let x represent the number of miles. So, x represents 100
miles.
Step 5 If 2 inches represents 25 miles, then 8 inches represents 100
miles.

Example:
An acid solution is composed of 7 parts water to 2 parts acid. How many
parts of water are there in a solution composed of 20 parts acid?

   Step 1 The unknown quantity is the number of parts of water.

   Let n = number of parts of water.

   Step 2 The three specified numbers are

   7 parts water

   2 parts acid

   20 parts acid

   Step 3 The comparisons are

   7 parts water to 2 parts acid        7
                                        2

   n parts water to 20 parts acid                n
                                                20

   7        n

   2  =     20

   Step 4 = Perf orm the cross multiplication. 7 n
                 2         20

   7  20 = 2  n

      140 = 2  n Divide 140 by 2.

      140        =n
         2

          70 = n

   In step 1 we let n represent the number of parts of water. So, n
   represents 70 parts of water.
   Step 5 7 parts water to 2 parts acid indicates 70 parts water to 20 parts
   acid.

games did this team lose if they won 63 games?

Step 1 The unknown quantity is the number of games lost.

Let n = number of games lost.

Step 2 Since      9        means  9  wins  to                                                          2  losses,  the  three  specified
                  2

numbers are

9 (wins)

2 (losses)

63 (wins)

Percent
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses percents. By the end of the
module students should understand the relationship between ratios and
percents and be able to make conversions between fractions, decimals, and
percents.

Section Overview

      Ratios and Percents
      The Relationship Between Fractions, Decimals, and Percents -
      Making Conversions

Ratios and Percents

Ratio, Percent
We defined a ratio as a comparison, by division, of two pure numbers or
two like denominate numbers. A most convenient number to compare
numbers to is 100. Ratios in which one number is compared to 100 are
called percents. The word percent comes from the Latin word "per
centum." The word "per" means "for each" or "for every," and the word
"centum" means "hundred." Thus, we have the following definition.

Percent means "for each hundred," or "for every hundred."

The symbol % is used to represent the word percent.

Sample Set A

Example:
The ratio 26 to 100 can be written as 26%. We read 26% as "twenty-six
percent."
Example:

The ratio  165  can be written as 165%.
           100

We read 165% as "one hundred sixty-five percent."

Example:

The percent 38% can be written as the fraction   . 38

                                                 100

Example:

The percent 210% can be written as the fraction  210   or the mixed number
                                                 100

2 10 or 2.1.
      100

Example:

Since one dollar is 100 cents, 25 cents is   25  of a dollar. This implies that
                                            100

25 cents is 25% of one dollar.

The Relationship Between Fractions, Decimals, and Percents -
Making Conversions

Since a percent is a ratio, and a ratio can be written as a fraction, and a
fraction can be written as a decimal, any of these forms can be converted to
any other.

Before we proceed to the problems in [link] and [link], let's summarize the
conversion techniques.

                              the % symbol             possible.

Conversion Techniques - Fractions, Decimals, Percents

Sample Set B

Example:

Convert 12% to a decimal.

12% =      12  = 0.12

       100

Note that

The % symbol is dropped, and the decimal point moves 2 places to the left.

Example:
Convert 0.75 to a percent.
0.75 =    75      = 75%

          100

Note that

The % symbol is affixed, and the decimal point moves 2 units to the right.

Example:

Convert    3   to a percent.
           5

We see in [link] that we can convert a decimal to a percent. We also know

that we can convert a fraction to a decimal. Thus, we can see that if we first

convert the fraction to a decimal, we can then convert the decimal to a

percent.

Conversions Involving Nonterminating Fractions

We must be careful when changing a fraction of 1% to a decimal. The

number   2  ,  as  we  know,  has  a  nonterminating  decimal  representation.
         3

Therefore, it cannot be expressed exactly as a decimal.

When converting nonterminating fractions of 1% to decimals, it is
customary to express the fraction as a rounded decimal with at least three
decimal places.

Converting a Nonterminating Fraction to a Decimal
To convert a nonterminating fraction of 1% to a decimal:

1. Convert the fraction as a rounded decimal.
2. Move the decimal point two digits to the left and remove the percent

  sign.

Sample Set B

Example:

Convert  2     % to a three-place decimal.
         3
1. Convert      2  to a decimal.
                3

Since we wish the resulting decimal to have three decimal digits, and

removing the percent sign will account for two of them, we need to

round        2  to one place (2 + 1 = 3).
             3

   32 % = 0.7% to one decimal place. ( 32 = 0.6666 ...)
2. Move the decimal point two digits to the left and remove the % sign.

  We'll need to add zeros to locate the decimal point in the correct
  location.

3 % = 0.007 2 to 3 decimal places

Example:

Convert  5   4  %  to  a  four-place  decimal.
            11

1. Since we wish the resulting decimal to have four decimal places, and

removing the percent sign will account for two, we to round         4  to
                                                                   11

two places.

  5 11 4 % = 5.36% to two decimal places. ( 11 4 = 0.3636 ...)
2. Move the decimal point two places to the left and drop the percent

  sign.

5 4 % = 0.0536 to four decimal places.
      11

Example:

Convert  28  5  %  to  a  decimal  rounded  to  ten  thousandths.
             9

1. Since we wish the resulting decimal to be rounded to ten thousandths
  (four decimal places), and removing the percent sign will account for
two, we need to round            5  to two places.
                                 9

  28 9 5 % = 28.56% to two decimal places. ( 95 = 0.5555 ...)
2. Move the decimal point to the left two places and drop the percent

  sign.

28  5      %  =  0.2856   correct   to  ten  thousandths.

Applications of Percents
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module
discusses applications of percents. By the end of the module students should be able to distinguish between
base, percent, and percentage and be able to find the percentage, the percent, and the base.

Section Overview

      Base, Percent, and Percentage
      Finding the Percentage
      Finding the Percent
      Finding the Base

Base, Percent, and Percentage

There are three basic types of percent problems. Each type involves a base, a percent, and a percentage, and
when they are translated from words to mathematic­ al symbols each becomes a multiplication statement.
Examples of these types of problems are the following:

   1. What number is 30% of 50? (Missing product statement.)
   2. 15 is what percent of 50? (Missing factor statement.)
   3. 15 is 30% of what number? (Missing factor statement.)

In problem 1, the product is missing. To solve the problem, we represent the missing product with P .

P = 30%  50

Percentage
The missing product P is called the percentage. Percentage means part, or port­ion. In P = 30%  50, P
represents a particular part of 50.

In problem 2, one of the factors is missing. Here we represent the missing factor with Q.

15 = Q  50

Percent
The missing factor is the percent. Percent, we know, means per 100, or part of 100. In 15 = Q  50, Q
indicates what part of 50 is being taken or considered. Specific­ ally, 15 = Q  50 means that if 50 was to be
divided into 100 equal parts, then Q indicates 15 are being considered.

In problem 3, one of the factors is missing. Represent the missing factor with B.

15 = 30%  B

Base
The missing factor is the base. Some meanings of base are a source of supply, or a starting place. In
15 = 30%  B, B indicates the amount of supply. Specifically, 15 = 30%  B indicates that 15 represents
30% of the total supply.

Each of these three types of problems is of the form

(percentage) = (percent)  (base)

We can determine any one of the three values given the other two using the methods discussed in [link].
Finding the Percentage

Sample Set A

Example:

What number is            30%     of  50?        Missing product statement.

                                      

(percentage) = (percent)  (base)

                        

  P                 =     30%         50         Convert 30% to a decimal.

  P                 =     .30         50         Multiply.

  P                 =     15

Thus, 15 is 30% of 50.

Example:

What number is            36%     of  95?        Missing product statement.

                                      

(percentage) = (percent)  (base)

                        

  P                 =     36%         95         Convert 36% to a decimal.

  P                 =     .36         95         Multiply

  P                 =     34.2

Thus, 34.2 is 36% of 95.

Example:
A salesperson, who gets a commission of 12% of each sale she makes, makes a sale of $8,400.00. How
much is her commission?
We need to determine what part of $8,400.00 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage.

What number is            12%     of 8,400.00? Missing product statement.

                                   

(percentage) = (percent)              (base)

                                               

  P                 =     12%         8,400.00 Convert to decimals.

  P                 =     .12         8,400.00 Multiply.

  P                 = 1008.00

Thus, the salesperson's commission is $1,008.00.

Example:
A girl, by practicing typing on her home computer, has been able to increase her typing speed by 110%. If
she originally typed 16 words per minute, by how many words per minute was she able to increase her
speed?

Summary of Key Concepts
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module reviews the key concepts from the chapter
"Ratios and Rates."

Summary of Key Concepts

Denominate Numbers ([link])
Numbers that appear along with units are denominate numbers. The
amounts 6 dollars and 4 pints are examples of denominate numbers.

Like and Unlike Denominate Numbers ([link])
Like denominate numbers are denominate numbers with like units. If the
units are not the same, the numbers are unlike denominate numbers.

Pure Numbers ([link])
Numbers appearing without a unit are pure numbers.

Comparing Numbers by Subtraction and Division ([link])
Comparison of two numbers by subtraction indicates how much more one
number is than another. Comparison by division indicates how many times
larger or smaller one number is than another.

Comparing Pure or Like Denominate Numbers by Subtraction ([link])
Numbers can be compared by subtraction if and only if they are pure
numbers or like denominate numbers.

Ratio Rate ([link])
A comparison, by division, of two like denominate numbers is a ratio. A
comparison, by division, of two unlike denominate numbers is a rate.

Proportion ([link])
A proportion is a statement that two ratios or rates are equal.

= 3 people 6 people is a proportion.
2 jobs  4 jobs

Solving a Proportion ([link])
To solve a proportion that contains three known numbers and a letter that
repre­sents an unknown quantity, perform the cross multiplication, then
divide the product of the two numbers by the number that multiplies the
letter.

Proportions Involving Rates ([link])
When writing a proportion involving rates it is very important to write it so
that the same type of units appears on the same side of either the equal sign
or the fraction bar.

unit type 1  =  unit type 1  or  unit type 1  =  unit type 2
unit type 2     unit type 2      unit type 1     unit type 2

Five-Step Method for Solving Proportions ([link])

1. By careful reading, determine what the unknown quantity is and
  represent it with some letter. There will be only one unknown in a
  problem.

2. Identify the three specified numbers.
3. Determine which comparisons are to be made and set up the

  proportion.
4. Solve the proportion.
5. Interpret and write a conclusion.

When solving applied problems, ALWAYS begin by determining the
unknown quantity and representing it with a letter.

Percents ([link])
A ratio in which one number is compared to 100 is a percent. Percent
means "for each hundred."

Conversion of Fractions, Decimals, and Percents ([link])
It is possible to convert decimals to percents, fractions to percents, percents
to decimals, and percents to fractions.

Applications of Percents:
The three basic types of percent problems involve a base, a percentage,
and a percent.
Base ([link])
The base is the number used for comparison.

Percentage ([link])
The percentage is the number being compared to the base.

Percent ([link])
By its definition, percent means part of.

Solving Problems ([link])

Percentage = (percent) × (base)

Percent  =  percentage
Base =              base

This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to estimate by rounding. By
the end of the module students should understand the reason for estimation
and be able to estimate the result of an addition, multiplication, subtraction,
or division using the rounding technique.

Section Overview

      Estimation By Rounding

When beginning a computation, it is valuable to have an idea of what value
to expect for the result. When a computation is completed, it is valuable to
know if the result is reasonable.

In the rounding process, it is important to note two facts:

   1. The rounding that is done in estimation does not always follow the
      rules of rounding discussed in [link] (Rounding Whole Numbers).
      Since estimat­ion is concerned with the expected value of a
      computation, rounding is done using convenience as the guide rather
      than using hard-and-fast rounding rules. For example, if we wish to
      estimate the result of the division 80 ÷ 26, we might round 26 to 20
      rather than to 30 since 80 is more conveniently divided by 20 than by
      30.

   2. Since rounding may occur out of convenience, and different people
      have differ­ent ideas of what may be convenient, results of an
      estimation done by rounding may vary. For a particular computation,
      different people may get different estimated results. Results may vary.

Estimation
Estimation is the process of determining an expected value of a
computation.

Common words used in estimation are about, near, and between.

Estimation by Rounding
The rounding technique estimates the result of a computation by rounding
the numbers involved in the computation to one or two nonzero digits.

Sample Set A

Example:                                                 6,100.
Estimate the sum: 2,357 + 6,106.
Notice that 2,357 is near 2,400, and that 6,106 is near

              two nonzero                                two nonzero

              digits                                     digits

The sum can be estimated by 2,400 + 6,100 = 8,500. (It is quick and easy
to add 24 and 61.)
Thus, 2,357 + 6,106 is about 8,400. In fact, 2,357 + 6,106 = 8,463.

Practice Set A
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the sum: 4,216 + 3,942.
   Solution:
   4,216 + 3,942 : 4,200 + 3,900. About 8,100. In fact, 8,158.
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the sum: 812 + 514.
   Solution:
   812 + 514 : 800 + 500. About 1,300. In fact, 1,326.
Exercise:
Problem: Estimate the sum: 43,892 + 92,106.
Solution:
43,892 + 92,106 : 44,000 + 92,000. About 136,000. In fact, 135,998.

Sample Set B

Example:                                                 3,000.
Estimate the difference: 5,203 - 3,015.
Notice that 5,203 is near 5,200, and that 3,015 is near

              two nonzero                                one nonzero

              digits                                     digit

The difference can be estimated by 5,200 - 3,000 = 2,200.

Thus, 5,203 - 3,015 is about 2,200. In fact, 5,203 - 3,015 = 2,188.

We could make a less accurate estimation by observing that 5,203 is near

5,000. The number 5,000 has only one nonzero digit rather than two (as

does 5,200). This fact makes the estimation quicker (but a little less

accurate). We then estimate the difference by 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000, and

conclude that 5,203 - 3,015 is about 2,000. This is why we say "answers

may vary."

Practice Set B
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the difference: 628 - 413.
   Solution:
   628 - 413 : 600 - 400. About 200. In fact, 215.
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the difference: 7,842 - 5,209.
   Solution:
   7,842 - 5,209 : 7,800 - 5,200. About 2,600. In fact, 2,633.
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the difference: 73,812 - 28,492.
   Solution:
   73,812 - 28,492 : 74,000 - 28,000. About 46,000. In fact, 45,320.

Sample Set C

Example:
Estimate the product: 73  46.
Notice that 73 is near 70, and that 46 is near 50.

              one nonzero     one nonzero
                       digit           digit

The product can be estimated by 70  50 = 3,500. (Recall that to multiply

numbers ending in zeros, we multiply the nonzero digits and affix to this

product the total number of ending zeros in the factors. See [link] for a

review of this technique.)

Thus, 73  46 is about 3,500. In fact, 73  46 = 3,358.

Example:
Estimate the product: 87  4,316.
Notice that 87 is close to 90, and that 4,316 is close to 4,000.

              one nonzero                          one nonzero

              digit                                digit

The product can be estimated by 90  4,000 = 360,000.
Thus, 87  4,316 is about 360,000. In fact, 87  4,316 = 375,492.

Practice Set C
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the product: 31  87.
   Solution:
   31  87 : 30  90. About 2,700. In fact, 2,697.
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the product: 18  42.
   Solution:
   18  42 : 20  40. About 800. In fact, 756.
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the product: 16  94.
   Solution:
   16  94 : 15  100. About 1,500. In fact, 1,504.

Sample Set D
Example:
Estimate the quotient: 153 ÷ 17.
Notice that 153 is close to 150, and that 17 is close to 15.

                                                                                       two nonzero      two nonzero
                                                                                                digits          digits

The quotient can be estimated by 150 ÷ 15 = 10.
Thus, 153 ÷ 17 is about 10. In fact, 153 ÷ 17 = 9.

Example:
Estimate the quotient: 742,000 ÷ 2,400.
Notice that 742,000 is close to 700,000 , and that 2,400 is close to

        one nonzero
                 digit

2,000.

one nonzero
         digit

The quotient can be estimated by 700,000 ÷ 2,000 = 350.
Thus, 742,000 ÷ 2,400 is about 350. In fact, 742,000 ÷ 2,400 = 309.16.

Practice Set D
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the quotient: 221 ÷ 18.
   Solution:
   221 ÷ 18 : 200 ÷ 20. About 10. In fact, 12.27.
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the quotient: 4,079 ÷ 381.
   Solution:
   4,079 ÷ 381 : 4,000 ÷ 400. About 10. In fact, 10.70603675...
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the quotient: 609,000 ÷ 16,000.
   Solution:
   609,000 ÷ 16,000 : 600,000 ÷ 15,000. About 40. In fact, 38.0625.

Sample Set E

Example:
Estimate the sum: 53.82 + 41.6.
Notice that 53.82 is close to 54, and that 41.6 is close to 42.

              two nonzero                             two nonzero
                      digits                                  digits

The sum can be estimated by 54 + 42 = 96.
Thus, 53.82 + 41.6 is about 96. In fact, 53.82 + 41.6 = 95.42.

Practice Set E
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the sum: 61.02 + 26.8.
   Solution:
   61.02 + 26.8 : 61 + 27. About 88. In fact, 87.82.
Exercise:
Problem: Estimate the sum: 109.12 + 137.88.

Solution:

109.12 + 137.88 : 110 + 138. About 248. In fact, 247. We could have
estimated 137.88 with 140. Then 110 + 140 is an easy mental
addition. We would conclude then that 109.12 + 137.88 is about 250.

Sample Set F

Example:
Estimate the product: (31.28)(14.2).
Notice that 31.28 is close to 30, and that 14.2 is close to 15.

              one nonzero                                                                                                two nonzero
                       digit                                                                                                     digits

The product can be estimated by 30  15 = 450. ( 3  15 = 45, then affix

one zero.)

Thus, (31.28)(14.2) is about 450. In fact, (31.28)(14.2) = 444.176.

Example:
Estimate 21% of 5.42.
Notice that 21% = .21 as a decimal, and that .21 is close to .2.

                                      one nonzero
                                               digit

Notice also that 5.42 is close to 5.

                                                                                                         one nonzero
                                                                                                                  digit

Then, 21% of 5.42 can be estimated by (.2)(5) = 1.
Thus, 21% of 5.42 is about 1. In fact, 21% of 5.42 is 1.1382.
Practice Set F
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate the product: (47.8)(21.1).
   Solution:
   (47.8)(21.1) : (50)(20). About 1,000. In fact, 1,008.58.
Exercise:

   Problem: Estimate 32% of 14.88.
   Solution:
   32% of 14.88 : (.3)(15). About 4.5. In fact, 4.7616.

Estimation by Clustering
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to estimate by clustering. By
the end of the module students should understand the concept of clustering
and be able to estimate the result of adding more than two numbers when
clustering occurs using the clustering technique.

Section Overview

      Estimation by Clustering

Cluster
When more than two numbers are to be added, the sum may be estimated
using the clustering technique. The rounding technique could also be used,
but if several of the numbers are seen to cluster (are seen to be close to)
one particular number, the clustering technique provides a quicker estimate.
Consider a sum such as

32 + 68 + 29 + 73

Notice two things:

   1. There are more than two numbers to be added.
   2. Clustering occurs.

         a. Both 68 and 73 cluster around 70, so 68 + 73 is close to
            80 + 70 = 2(70) = 140.

         b. Both 32 and 29 cluster around 30, so 32 + 29 is close to
            30 + 30 = 2(30) = 60.

The sum may be estimated by
(2  30) + (2  70) = 6 + 140
                                                = 200

In fact, 32 + 68 + 29 + 73 = 202.

Sample Set A

Estimate each sum. Results may vary.

Example:
27 + 48 + 31 + 52.
27 and 31 cluster near 30. Their sum is about 2  30 = 60.
48 and 52 cluster near 50. Their sum is about 2  50 = 100.

                                                                                   (2  30) + (2  50) = 60 + 100

Thus, 27 + 48 + 31 + 52 is about

                                                                                                                                   = 160

In fact, 27 + 48 + 31 + 52 = 158.

Example:
88 + 21 + 19 + 91.
88 and 91 cluster near 90. Their sum is about 2  90 = 180.
21 and 19 cluster near 20. Their sum is about 2  20 = 40.

                                                                                   (2  90) + (2  20) = 180 + 40

Thus, 88 + 21 + 19 + 91 is about

                                                                                                                                   = 220

In fact, 88 + 21 + 19 + 91 = 219.

Example:
17 + 21 + 48 + 18.
17, 21, and 18 cluster near 20. Their sum is about 3  20 = 60.
48 is about 50.
                                                                                   (3  20) + 50 = 60 + 50

Thus, 17 + 21 + 48 + 18 is about

                                                                                                                       = 110

In fact, 17 + 21 + 48 + 18 = 104.

Example:
61 + 48 + 49 + 57 + 52.
61 and 57 cluster near 60. Their sum is about 2  60 = 120.
48, 49, and 52 cluster near 50. Their sum is about 3  50 = 150.
Thus, 61 + 48 + 49 + 57 + 52 is about

(2  60) + (3  50) = 120 + 150
                                                 = 270

In fact, 61 + 48 + 49 + 57 + 52 = 267.

Example:
706 + 321 + 293 + 684.
706 and 684 cluster near 700. Their sum is about 2  700 = 1,400.
321 and 293 cluster near 300. Their sum is about 2  300 = 600.
Thus, 706 + 321 + 293 + 684 is about

 (2  700) + (2  300) = 1,400 + 600
                                                       = 2,000

In fact, 706 + 321 + 293 + 684 = 2,004.

Mental Arithmetic-Using the Distributive Property
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis, Jr. This
module discusses using the distributive property. By the end of the module students should
understand the distributive property and be able to obtain the exact result of a multiplication using
the distributive property.

Section Overview

      The Distributive Property
      Estimation Using the Distributive Property

The Distributive Property

Distributive Property
The distributive property is a characteristic of numbers that involves both addition and
multiplication. It is used often in algebra, and we can use it now to obtain exact results for a
multiplication.

Suppose we wish to compute 3(2 + 5). We can proceed in either of two ways, one way which is
known to us already (the order of operations), and a new way (the distributive property).

   1. Compute 3(2 + 5) using the order of operations.

3(2 + 5)

Operate inside the parentheses first: 2 + 5 = 7.

3(2 + 5) = 3  7

Now multiply 3 and 7.

     3(2 + 5) = 3  7 = 21

  Thus, 3(2 + 5) = 21.
2. Compute 3(2 + 5) using the distributive property.

  We know that multiplication describes repeated addition. Thus,

3(2 + 5) = 2 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 5

                2 + 5 appears 3 times

          = 2+2+2+5+5+5                           (by the commutative property of addition)

          = 32+35                      (since multiplication describes repeated addition)

          = 6 + 15

          = 21

Thus, 3(2 + 5) = 21.

Let's look again at this use of the distributive property.
3(2 + 5) = 2 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 5

                                                             2 + 5 appears 3 times

3(2 + 5) =  2+2+2 + 5+5+5

            2 appears 3 times  5 appears 3 times

      The 3 has been distributed to the 2 and 5.
      This is the distributive property. We distribute the factor to each addend in the parentheses.
      The distributive property works for both sums and differences.

Sample Set A

Example:

Using the order of operations, we get

4(6 + 2) = 4  8
                          = 32

Example:

Using the order of operations, we get

8(9 + 6) = 8  15
                          = 120

Estimation Using the Distributive Property

We can use the distributive property to obtain exact results for products such as 25  23. The
distributive property works best for products when one of the factors ends in 0 or 5. We shall restrict
our attention to only such products.

Sample Set B
Use the distributive property to compute each value.

Example:

25  23

Notice that 23 = 20 + 3. We now write

Thus, 25  23 = 575
We could have proceeded by writing 23 as 30 - 7.
Example:

15  37

Notice that 37 = 30 + 7. We now write

Thus, 15  37 = 555
We could have proceeded by writing 37 as 40 - 3.

Example:

15  86

Notice that 86 = 80 + 6. We now write

We could have proceeded by writing 86 as 90 - 4.

how to estimate by rounding fractions. By the end of the module students should be able to estimate the sum of
two or more fractions using the technique of rounding fractions.

Section Overview

       Estimation by Rounding Fractions

Estimation by rounding fractions is a useful technique for estimating the result of a computation involving

fractions. Fractions are commonly rounded to                1,  1,     3  ,  0,  and  1.  Remember    that  rounding  may    cause  estimates  to
                                                                       4
                                                            4   2

vary.

Sample Set A
Make each estimate remembering that results may vary.

Example:

Estimate 53 + 12 5 .

Notice that     3  is about  1  ,  and  that   5  is about  1.
                5            2                12
                                                            2

Thus, 5 + 12 3 5 is about 2 + 2 = 1 1 1 . In fact, 5 + 12 = 60 3 5 61 , a little more than 1.

Example:

Estimate 5 + 4 + 11 3 9 1 .
             8         10          5

Adding the whole number parts, we get 20. Notice that                        3   is close to  1,   9  is close to 1, and  1  is close to  1.
                                                                             8                    10                      5
                                                                                              4                                           4

Then 3 + 9 + 1 is close to 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 1 .
       8     10        5                4         4         2

Thus, 5 3 + 4 9 + 11 1 is close to 20 + 1 1 = 21 1 .
          8        10        5                       2              2

In fact, 5 83 + 4 10 9 + 11 51 = 21 40 19 , a little less than 21 21 .

Practice Set A
Use the method of rounding fractions to estimate the result of each computation. Results may vary.
Exercise:

   Problem: 85 + 12 5
   Solution:
   Results may vary. 21 + 21 = 1. In fact, 85 + 12 5 = 24 25 = 1 24 1
Exercise:

   Problem: 97 + 53
   Solution:
Results may vary. 1 +                                            1  = 1 1 . In fact,  7  +  3                 17

                                                                                               =1

                                                                 2     2              9     5  45

Solution:

Results may vary. (16 + 0) + (4 + 1) = 16 + 5 = 21. In fact, 16 1 + 4 7 = 20 37
                                                                                                                          20      8  40

Summary of Key Concepts
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module reviews the key concepts from the chapter
"Techniques of Estimation."

Summary of Key Concepts

Estimation ([link])
Estimation is the process of determining an expected value of a
computation.

Estimation By Rounding ([link])
The rounding technique estimates the result of a computation by rounding
the numbers involved in the computation to one or two nonzero digits. For
example, 512 + 896 can be estimated by 500 + 900 = 1,400.

Cluster ([link])
When several numbers are close to one particular number, they are said to
cluster near that particular number.

Estimation By Clustering ([link])
The clustering technique of estimation can be used when

   1. there are more than two numbers to be added, and
   2. clustering occurs.

For example, 31 + 62 + 28 + 59 can be estimated by

(2  30) + (2  60) = 60 + 120 = 180

Distributive Property ([link])
The distributive property is a characteristic of numbers that involves both
addition and multiplication. For example,

3(4 + 6) = 3  4 + 3  6 = 12 + 18 = 30

Estimation Using the Distributive Property ([link])
The distributive property can be used to obtain exact results for a
multiplication.
For example,

15  23 = 15  (20 + 3) = 15  20 + 15  3 = 300 + 45 = 345

Estimation by Rounding Fractions ([link])

Estimation by rounding fractions commonly rounds fractions to  1,  1,  3,

                                                               4   2   4

0, and 1.

For example,

12 5 + 16 5 can be estimated by 21 + 41 = 43

Measurement

There are two major systems of measurement in use today. They are the United States system and the metric
system. Before we describe these systems, let's gain a clear understanding of the concept of measurement.

Measurement
Measurement is comparison to some standard.

Standard Unit of Measure
The concept of measurement is based on the idea of direct comparison. This means that measurement is the result
of the comparison of two quantities. The quantity that is used for comparison is called the standard unit of
measure.

Over the years, standards have changed. Quite some time in the past, the stand­ ard unit of measure was determined
by a king. For example,

1 inch was the distance between the tip of the thumb and the knuckle of the king.
1 inch was also the length of 16 barley grains placed end to end.

Today, standard units of measure rarely change. Standard units of measure are the responsibility of the Bureau of
Standards in Washington D.C.

Some desirable properties of a standard are the following:

   1. Accessibility. We should have access to the standard so we can make comparisons.
   2. Invariance. We should be confident that the standard is not subject to change.
   3. Reproducibility. We should be able to reproduce the standard so that measure­ments are convenient and

      accessible to many people.

The United States System of Measurement

Some of the common units (along with their abbreviations) for the United States system of measurement are listed
in the following table.

Unit Conversion Table  1 foot (ft) = 12 inches (in.)
Length                 1 yard (yd) = 3 feet (ft)
                       1 mile (mi) = 5,280 feet
Weight              1 pound (lb) =16 ounces (oz)
Liquid Volume       1 ton (T) = 2,000 pounds
Time
                    1 tablespoon (tbsp) = 3 teaspoons (tsp)
                    1 fluid ounce (fl oz) = 2 tablespoons
                    1 cup (c) = 8 fluid ounces
                    1 pint (pt) = 2 cups
                    1 quart (qt) = 2 pints
                    1 gallon (gal) = 4 quarts

                    1 minute (min) = 60 seconds (sec)
                    1 hour ( hr) = 60 minutes
                    1 day (da) = 24 hours
                    1 week (wk) = 7 days

Conversions in the United States System

It is often convenient or necessary to convert from one unit of measure to another. For example, it may be
convenient to convert a measurement of length that is given in feet to one that is given in inches. Such
conversions can be made using unit fractions.

Unit Fraction
A unit fraction is a fraction with a value of 1.

Unit fractions are formed by using two equal measurements. One measurement is placed in the numerator of the
fraction, and the other in the denominator. Place­ment depends on the desired conversion.

Placement of Units
Place the unit being converted to in the numerator.
Place the unit being converted from in the denominator.

For example,

Equal Measurements  Unit Fraction

1f t = 12in.        1f t       12in.
1pt = 16 f l oz
1wk = 7da           12in.  or  1f t

                    1pt            16 f l oz

                    16 f l oz  or    1pt

                    7da        1wk

                    1wk   or   7da

Sample Set A
Make the following conversions. If a fraction occurs, convert it to a decimal rounded to two decimal places.
Example:

Convert 11 yards to feet.

Looking in the unit conversion table under length, we see that 1yd = 3 ft. There are two corresponding unit

fractions, 3 ft 1 yd and 1 yd 3 ft . Which one should we use? Look to see which unit we wish to convert to. Choose the unit

fraction with this unit in the numerator. We will choose                                          3 ft  since this unit fraction has feet in the numerator.
                                                                                                  1 yd

Now, multiply 11 yd by the unit fraction. Notice that since the unit fraction has the value of 1, multiplying by it

does not change the value of 11 yd.

11yd =         11yd         3f t                                Divide out common units.

                          

               1            1yd

=              11 yd                3f t                        (Units can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided, just as numbers can.)
                     1
                            

                                  1 yd

=              113f t
                     1

                 = 33f t

Thus, 11yd = 33ft.

Example:

Convert 36 fl oz to pints.

Looking in the unit conversion table under liquid volume, we see that 1 pt = 16 fl oz. Since we are to convert to

pints, we will construct a unit fraction with pints in the numerator.

                  36f l oz                                      1pt

36f l oz =              1                                       16f l oz     Divide out common units.

            =  36 f l oz                1pt
                       1
                            

                                  16 f l oz

Example:

Convert 2,016 hr to weeks.

Looking in the unit conversion table under time, we see that 1wk = 7da and that 1da = 24 hr. To convert from

hours to weeks, we must first convert from hours to days and then from days to weeks. We need two unit

fractions.

The unit fraction needed for converting from hours to days is                                            1 da                                                 .  The  unit  fraction  needed  for  converting  from

The Metric System of Measurement
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and
Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses the Metric System of measurement. By
the end of the module students should be more familiar with some of the
advantages of the base ten number system, know the prefixes of the metric
measures, be familiar with the metric system of measurement and be able to
convert from one unit of measure in the metric system to another unit of
measure

Section Overview

      The Advantages of the Base Ten Number System
      Prefixes
      Conversion from One Unit to Another Unit
      Conversion Table

The Advantages of the Base Ten Number System

The metric system of measurement takes advantage of our base ten number sys-­
tem. The advantage of the metric system over the United States system is that in
the metric system it is possible to convert from one unit of measure to another
simply by multiplying or dividing the given number by a power of 10. This
means we can make a conversion simply by moving the decimal point to the
right or the left.

Prefixes

Common units of measure in the metric system are the meter (for length), the
liter (for volume), and the gram (for mass). To each of the units can be attached
a prefix. The metric prefixes along with their meaning are listed below.
Metric Prefixes

      kilothousand
      decitenth
      hectohundred
      centihundredth
      dekaten
      millithousandth
For example, if length is being measured,

1 kilometer is equivalent to 1000 meters.
1 centimeter is equivalent to one hundredth of a meter.
1 millimeter is equivalent to one thousandth of a meter.

Conversion from One Unit to Another Unit

Let's note three characteristics of the metric system that occur in the metric table
of measurements.

   1. In each category, the prefixes are the same.
   2. We can move from a larger to a smaller unit of measure by moving the

      decimal point to the right.
   3. We can move from a smaller to a larger unit of measure by moving the

      decimal point to the left.

The following table provides a summary of the relationship between the basic
unit of measure (meter, gram, liter) and each prefix, and how many places the
decimal point is moved and in what direction.

unit to kilo          1 to 0.1    3 places to the left
unit to deci          1 to 0.01   1 place to the right
unit to centi                     2 places to the right

Distinction Between Mass and Weight
There is a distinction between mass and weight. The weight of a body is related
to gravity whereas the mass of a body is not. For example, your weight on the
earth is different than it is on the moon, but your mass is the same in both
places. Mass is a measure of a body's resistance to motion. The more massive a
body, the more resistant it is to motion. Also, more massive bodies weigh more
than less massive bodies.

Converting Metric Units
To convert from one metric unit to another metric unit:

   1. Determine the location of the original number on the metric scale (pictured
      in each of the following examples).

   2. Move the decimal point of the original number in the same direction and
      same number of places as is necessary to move to the metric unit you wish
      to go to.
We can also convert from one metric unit to another using unit fractions. Both
methods are shown in [link] of [link].

Sample Set A

Example:
Convert 3 kilograms to grams.

   a. 3 kg can be written as 3.0 kg. Then,

      Thus, 3kg = 3,000 g.
   b. We can also use unit fractions to make this conversion.

      Since we are converting to grams, and 1,000 g = 1 kg, we choose the

                                                              1,000 g

      unit fraction 1 kg since grams is in the numerator.

                                                                                 1,000 g

            3 kg = 3 kg 

                                                                                      1 kg
                                                                                       1,000 g

                               = 3 kg 

                                                                                          1 kg

                               = 3  1,000 g
                               = 3,000 g

Example:
Convert 67.2 hectoliters to milliliters.
Thus, 67.2 hL = 6,720,000 mL.
Example:
Convert 100.07 centimeters to meters.

Thus, 100.07 cm = 1.0007 m.
Example:
Convert 0.16 milligrams to grams.

Thus, 0.16 mg = 0.00016 g.

Simplification of Denominate Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to simplify denominate
numbers. By the end of the module students should be able to convert an
unsimplified unit of measure to a simplified unit of measure, be able to add
and subtract denominate numbers and be able to multiply and divide a
denominate number by a whole number.

Section Overview

      Converting to Multiple Units
      Adding and Subtracting Denominate Numbers
      Multiplying a Denominate Number by a Whole Number
      Dividing a Denominate Number by a Whole Number

Converting to Multiple Units

Denominate Numbers
Numbers that have units of measure associated with them are called
denominate numbers. It is often convenient, or even necessary, to simplify
a denominate number.

Simplified Denominate Number
A denominate number is simplified when the number of standard units of
measure associated With it does not exceed the next higher type of unit.

The denominate number 55 min is simplified since it is smaller than the
next higher type of unit, 1 hr. The denominate number 65 min is not
simplified since it is not smaller than the next higher type of unit, 1 hr. The
denominate number 65 min can be simplified to 1 hr 5 min. The
denominate number 1 hr 5 min is simplified since the next higher type of
unit is day, and 1 hr does not exceed 1 day.

Sample Set A
Example:
Simplify 19 in.
Since 12 in. = 1 ft, and 19 = 12 + 7,

19 in. = 12 in. + 7 in.
                   = 1 f t + 7 in.
                   = 1 f t 7 in.

Example:
Simplify 4 gal 5 qt.
Since 4 qt = 1 gal, and 5 = 4 + 1,

4 gal 5 qt = 4 gal + 4 qt + 1qt
                            = 4 gal + 1 gal + 1 qt
                            = 5 gal + 1 qt
                            = 5 gal 1 qt

Example:
Simplify 2 hr 75 min.
Since 60 min = 1 hr, and 75 = 60 + 15,

2 hr 75 min = 2 hr + 60 min + 15 min
                                  = 2 hr + 1 hr + 15 min
                                  = 3 hr + 15 min
                                  = 3 hr 15 min

Example:
Simplify 43 fl oz.
Since 8 fl oz = 1 c (1 cup), and 43 ÷ 8 = 5R3,
 43 f l oz = 40 f l oz + 3 f l oz
                        = 5  8 f l oz + 3 f l oz
                        = 5  1 c + 3 f l oz
                        = 5 c + 3 f l oz

But, 2 c = 1 pt and 5 ÷ 2 = 2R1. So,

 5 c + 3 f l oz = 2  2 c + 1 c + 3 f l oz
                                    = 2  1 pt + 1 c + 3 f l oz
                                    = 2 pt + 1 c + 3 f l oz

But, 2 pt = 1 qt, so

2 pt + 1 c + 3 f l oz = 1 qt 1 c 3 f l oz

Adding and Subtracting Denominate Numbers

Adding and Subtracting Denominate Numbers
Denominate numbers can be added or subtracted by:

   1. writing the numbers vertically so that the like units appear in the same
      column.

   2. adding or subtracting the number parts, carrying along the unit.
   3. simplifying the sum or difference.

Sample Set B

Example:
Add 6 ft 8 in. to 2 ft 9 in.

     6 f t 8 in.

+2 f t 9 in.

   8 f t 17 in. Simplif y this denominate number.

Since 12 in. = 1 ft,

8 f t + 12 in. + 5 in. = 8 f t + 1 f t + 5 in.

                                                      = 9 f t + 5 in.

                                                      = 9 f t 5 in.

Example:
Subtract 5 da 3 hr from 8 da 11 hr.

    8 da 11 hr

-5 da 3 hr

    3 da 8 hr

Example:
Subtract 3 lb 14 oz from 5 lb 3 oz.

    5 lb 3 oz

-3 lb 14 oz

We cannot directly subtract 14 oz from 3 oz, so we must borrow 16 oz
from the pounds.

5 lb 3 oz = 5 lb + 3 oz

= 4 lb + 1 lb + 3 oz

= 4 lb + 16 oz + 3 oz (Since 1 lb = 16 oz.)

= 4 lb + 19 oz

                     =  4 lb 19 oz
4 lb 19 oz

-3 lb 14 oz

1 lb 5 oz
Example:
Subtract 4 da 9 hr 21 min from 7 da 10 min.

     7 da 0 hr 10 min

                         Borrow 1 da from the 7 da.

-4 da 9 hr 21 min
     6 da 24 hr 10 min

                           Borrow 1 hr from the 24 hr.

-4 da 9 hr 21 min
     6 da 23 hr 70 min

-4 da 9 hr 21 min
     2 da 14 hr 49 min

Multiplying a Denominate Number by a Whole Number

Let's examine the repeated sum
4 f t 9 in. + 4 f t 9 in. + 4 f t 9 in. = 12 f t 27 in.
                              3 times

Recalling that multiplication is a description of repeated addition, by the
distribut­ive property we have

3(4 f t 9 in.) = 3(4 f t + 9 in.)

= 3  4 f t + 3  9 in.

= 12 f t + 27 in.                                         Now, 27 in. = 2 f t 3 in.

= 12 f t + 2 f t + 3 in.

= 14 f t + 3 in.

= 14 f t 3 in.

From these observations, we can suggest the following rule.

Multiplying a Denominate Number by a Whole Number
To multiply a denominate number by a whole number, multiply the number
part of each unit by the whole number and affix the unit to this product.

Sample Set C
Perform the following multiplications. Simplify if necessary.

Example:

6  (2 f t 4 in.) = 6  2 f t + 6  4 in.

                                       = 12 f t + 24 in.

Since 3 ft = 1 yd and 12 in. = 1 ft,

12 f t + 24 in. = 4 yd + 2 f t

                                      = 4 yd 2 f t
Example:

 8  (5 hr 21 min 55 sec) = 8  5hr + 8  21 min + 8  55 sec
                                                                = 40 hr + 168 min + 440sec
                                                                = 40 hr + 168 min + 7 min + 20 sec
                                                                = 40 hr + 175 min + 20 sec
                                                                = 40 hr + 2 hr + 55 min + 20 sec
                                                                = 42 hr + 55 min + 20 sec
                                                                = 24hr + 18hr + 55 min + 20 sec
                                                                = 1 da + 18 hr + 55 min + 20 sec
                                                                = 1 da 18 hr 55 min 20 sec

Dividing a Denominate Number by a Whole Number

Dividing a Denominate Number by a Whole Number
To divide a denominate number by a whole number, divide the number part
of each unit by the whole number beginning with the largest unit. Affix the
unit to this quotient. Carry any remainder to the next unit.

Sample Set D
Perform the following divisions. Simplify if necessary.

Example:

(12 min 40 sec) ÷ 4

Thus (12 min 40 sec) ÷ 4 = 3min 10 sec
Example:

(5 yd 2 f t 9 in.) ÷ 3

Convert to f eet: 2 yd 2 f t = 8 f t  .

Convert to inches: 2 f t 9 in .  = 33 in .

Thus (5 yd 2 f t 9 in.) ÷ 3 = 1yd 2 f t 11 in.

Perimeter and Circumference of Geometric Figures
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis, Jr.
This module discusses perimeter and circumference of geometric figures. By the end of the
module students should know what a polygon is, know what perimeter is and how to find it,
know what the circumference, diameter, and radius of a circle is and how to find each one,
know the meaning of the symbol  and its approximating value and know what a formula is
and four versions of the circumference formula of a circle.

      Formulas

Polygons

We can make use of conversion skills with denominate numbers to make measure­ments of
geometric figures such as rectangles, triangles, and circles. To make these measurements we
need to be familiar with several definitions.
Polygon
A polygon is a closed plane (flat) figure whose sides are line segments (portions of straight
lines).
Polygons

Not polygons
Perimeter

Perimeter
The perimeter of a polygon is the distance around the polygon.
To find the perimeter of a polygon, we simply add up the lengths of all the sides.
Sample Set A
Find the perimeter of each polygon.

Example:

 Perimeter = 2 cm + 5 cm + 2 cm + 5 cm
                               = 14 cm

Example:
Perimeter =  3.1 mm

             4.2 mm

             4.3 mm

             1.52 mm

             5.4 mm

             +9.2 mm

             27.72 mm

Example:

Our first observation is that three of the dimensions are missing. However, we can determine
the missing measurements using the following process. Let A, B, and C represent the
missing measurements. Visualize
A = 12m - 2m = 10m

B = 9m + 1m - 2m = 8m

C = 12m - 1m = 11m

Perimeter =  8m

             10 m

             2m

             2m

             9m

             11 m

             1m

             + 1m

             44 m

Circumference/Diameter/Radius

Circumference
The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle.
Diameter
A diameter of a circle is any line segment that passes through the center of the circle and has
its endpoints on the circle.
Radius
A radius of a circle is any line segment having as its endpoints the center of the circle and a
point on the circle.
The radius is one half the diameter.

The Number 

The symbol , read "pi," represents the nonterminating, nonrepeating decimal number
3.14159 ... . This number has been computed to millions of decimal places without the
appearance of a repeating block of digits.
For computational purposes,  is often approximated as 3.14. We will write   3.14 to
denote that  is approximately equal to 3.14. The symbol "" means "approximately equal
to."

Formulas

To find the circumference of a circle, we need only know its diameter or radius. We then use
a formula for computing the circumference of the circle.
Formula
A formula is a rule or method for performing a task. In mathematics, a formula is a rule that
directs us in computations.
Formulas are usually composed of letters that represent important, but possibly unknown,
quantities.
If C, d, and r represent, respectively, the circumference, diameter, and radius of a circle, then
the following two formulas give us directions for computing the circumf­erence of the circle.
Circumference Formulas

   1. C = d or C  (3.14)d
   2. C = 2r or C  2(3.14)r

Sample Set B
Example:
Find the exact circumference of the circle.

Use the formula C = d.

C =   7in.

By commutativity of multiplication,

C = 7in.  

C = 7in., exactly
This result is exact since  has not been approximated.

Example:
Find the approximate circumference of the circle.

Use the formula C = d.

C  (3.14)(6.2)
C  19.648 mm

This result is approximate since  has been approximated by 3.14.

Example:
Find the approximate circumference of a circle with radius 18 inches.
Since we're given that the radius, r, is 18 in., we'll use the formula C = 2r.

C  (2)(3.14)(18 in.)
C  113.04 in.
Example:
Find the approximate perimeter of the figure.

We notice that we have two semicircles (half circles).
The larger radius is 6.2 cm.
The smaller radius is 6.2 cm - 2.0 cm = 4.2 cm.
The width of the bottom part of the rectangle is 2.0 cm.

Perimeter  =    2.0 cm

                5.1 cm

                2.0 cm

                5.1 cm

                (0.5)  (2)  (3.14)  (6.2 cm) Circumf erence of outer semicircle.

                + (0.5)  (2)  (3.14)  (4.2 cm) Circumf erence of inner semicircle

                                               6.2 cm - 2.0 cm = 4.2 cm
                                               The 0.5 appears because we want the
                                               perimeter of only half a circle.

Perimeter       2.0 cm

Area and Volume of Geometric Figures and Objects
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and
Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses area and volume of geometric figures and
objects. By the end of the module students should know the meaning and
notation for area, know the area formulas for some common geometric figures,
be able to find the areas of some common geometric figures, know the meaning
and notation for volume, know the volume formulas for some common
geometric objects and be able to find the volume of some common geometric
objects.

      Finding Volumes of Some Common Geometric Objects

Quite often it is necessary to multiply one denominate number by another. To do
so, we multiply the number parts together and the unit parts together. For
example,

8 in.  8 in. = 8  8  in.  in.

                                                                               2

                               = 64 in.

4mm  4 mm  4 mm = 4  4  4  mm  mm  mm

                                                                                                                      3

                                                        = 64 mm

Sometimes the product of units has a physical meaning. In this section, we will
examine the meaning of the products (length unit)2 and (length unit)3.

The Meaning and Notation for Area

The product (length unit)  (length unit) = (length unit)2, or, square length
unit (sq length unit), can be interpreted physically as the area of a surface.

Area
The area of a surface is the amount of square length units contained in the
surface.

For example, 3 sq in. means that 3 squares, 1 inch on each side, can be placed
precisely on some surface. (The squares may have to be cut and rearranged so
they match the shape of the surface.)

We will examine the area of the following geometric figures.
Area Formulas

We can determine the areas of these geometric figures using the following
formulas.

Finding Areas of Some Common Geometric Figures

Sample Set A

Example:
Find the area of the triangle.

       1

AT  =  2  bh

       1

    =  2   20  6 sq f t

    = 10  6 sq f t

            = 60 sq f t

                                                 2

            = 60 f t

The area of this triangle is 60 sq ft, which is often written as 60 ft2.
Example:
Find the area of the rectangle.

Let's first convert 4 ft 2 in. to inches. Since we wish to convert to inches, we'll

use the unit fraction      12 in.  since it has inches in the numerator. Then,
                             1 ft

        4 ft    12in.

4f t =  1       1 ft

=       4 ft        12in.
           1
              

                     1 ft

            = 48in.

Thus, 4 f t 2 in. = 48 in. + 2 in. = 50 in.

AR = l  w

= 50 in.  8 in.

             = 400 sq in.

The area of this rectangle is 400 sq in.

Example:
Find the area of the parallelogram.

AP = b  h
             = 10.3 cm  6.2 cm

             = 63.86 sq cm

The area of this parallelogram is 63.86 sq cm.
Example:
Find the area of the trapezoid.

AT rap =              1
                   =
                   =  2  (b1 + b2 )  h
                   =
                      1

                           (14.5 mm, +, 20.4 mm)  (4.1 mm)

                      2

                      1

                           (34.9 mm)  (4.1 mm)

                      2

                      1

                           (143.09 sq mm)

                      2

                   = 71.545 sq mm

The area of this trapezoid is 71.545 sq mm.

Example:
Find the approximate area of the circle.

                                              2

Ac =   r

                                                                                          2

             (3.14)  (16.8 f t)
             (3.14)  (282.24 sq f t)
             888.23 sq f t

The area of this circle is approximately 886.23 sq ft.

The Meaning and Notation for Volume

The product (length unit)(length unit)(length unit) = (length unit)3, or
cubic length unit (cu length unit), can be interpreted physically as the volume of
a three-dimensional object.

Volume
The volume of an object is the amount of cubic length units contained in the
object.

For example, 4 cu mm means that 4 cubes, 1 mm on each side, would precisely
fill some three-dimensional object. (The cubes may have to be cut and
rearranged so they match the shape of the object.)

Summary of Key Concepts
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module reviews the key concepts from the chapter
"Measurement and Geometry."

Summary of Key Concepts

Measurement ([link])
Measurement is comparison to some standard.

Standard Unit of Measure ([link])
A quantity that is used for comparison is called a standard unit of
measure.

Two Types of Measurement Systems ([link])
There are two major types of measurement systems in use today. They are
the United States system and the metric system.

Unit Fraction ([link])
A unit fraction is a fraction that has a value of 1. Unit fractions can be used
to convert from one unit of measure to another.

Meter, Liter, Gram, and associated prefixes ([link])
Common units of measure in the metric system are the meter (m), for
length, the liter (L), for volume, and the gram (g), for mass. To each of
these units, a prefix can be attached.

      kilothousand
      decitenth
      hectohundred
      centihundredth
      dekaten
      millithousandth

Metric Conversions ([link])
To convert from one metric unit to another:

   1. Determine the location of the original number on the metric scale.
   2. Move the decimal point of the original number in the same direction
      and the same number of places as is necessary to move to the metric
      unit you wish to convert to.

Denominate Numbers ([link])
Numbers that have units of measure associated with them are denominate
num­bers. The number 25 mg is a denominate number since the mg unit is
associated with the pure number 25. The number 82 is not a denominate
number since it has no unit of measure associated with it.

Simplified Denominate Number ([link])
A denominate number is simplified when the number of standard units of
measure associated with it does not exceed the next higher type of unit. 55
min is simplified, whereas 65 min is not simplified

Addition and Subtraction of Denominate Numbers ([link])
Denominate numbers can be added or subtracted by

   1. writing the numbers vertically so that the like units appear in the same
      column.

   2. adding or subtracting the number parts, carrying along the unit.
   3. simplifying the sum or difference.

Multiplying a Denominate Number by a Whole Number ([link])
To multiply a denominate number by a whole number, multiply the number
part of each unit by the whole number and affix the unit to the product.

Dividing a Denominate Number by a Whole Number ([link])
To divide a denominate number by a whole number, divide the number part
of each unit by the whole number beginning with the largest unit. Affix the
unit to this quotient. Carry the remainder to the next unit.

Polygon ([link])
A polygon is a closed plane (flat) figure whose sides are line segments
(portions of straight lines).

Perimeter ([link])
The perimeter of a polygon is the distance around the polygon.
Circumference, Diameter, Radius ([link])
The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle. The
diameter of a circle is any line segment that passes through the center of
the circle and has its endpoints on the circle. The radius of a circle is one
half the diameter of the circle.

The number  ([link])
The symbol , read "pi," represents the nonterminating, nonrepeating
decimal number 3.14159... . For computational purposes,  is often
approximated by the number 3.14.

Formula ([link])
A formula is a rule for performing a task. In mathematics, a formula is a
rule that directs us in computations.

Circumference Formulas ([link])

C =   d C  (3.14)d

C = 2    r C  2(3.14)r

Area ([link])
The area of a surface is the amount of square length units contained in the
surface.

Volume ([link])
The volume of an object is a measure of the amount of cubic length units
contained in the object.

Area Formulas ([link])
Triangle: A = 1  b  h

                                                     2

Rectangle: A = l  w
Parallelogram: A = b  h
Trapezoid: A = 1  (b1 + b2)  h

                                                           2

Circle: A =   r2

Volume Formulas ([link])
Rectangle solid: V = l  w  h
Sphere: V = 3    r 4 3
Cylinder: V =   r2  h
Cone: V = 1    r2  h

between variables and constants, be able to recognize a real number and
particular subsets of the real numbers and understand the ordering of the
real numbers.

Variables and Constants

A basic distinction between algebra and arithmetic is the use of symbols
(usually letters) in algebra to represent numbers. So, algebra is a
generalization of arithme­tic. Let us look at two examples of situations in
which letters are substituted for numbers:

   1. Suppose that a student is taking four college classes, and each class
      can have at most 1 exam per week. In any 1-week period, the student
      may have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 exams. In algebra, we can let the letter x
      represent the number of exams this student may have in a 1-week
      period. The letter x may assume any of the various values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

   2. Suppose that in writing a term paper for a biology class a student needs
      to specify the average lifetime, in days, of a male housefly. If she does
      not know this number off the top of her head, she might represent it (at
      least temporarily) on her paper with the letter t (which reminds her of
      time). Later, she could look up the average time in a reference book
      and find it to be 17 days. The letter t can assume only the one value,
      17, and no other values. The value t is constant.

Variable, Constant
   1. A letter or symbol that represents any member of a collection of two or
      more numbers is called a variable.

   2. A letter or symbol that represents one specific number, known or
      unknown, is called a constant.

In example 1, the letter x is a variable since it can represent any of the
numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The letter t example 2 is a constant since it can only
have the value 17.

Real Numbers

Real Number Line
The study of mathematics requires the use of several collections of
numbers. The real number line allows us to visually display (graph) the
numbers in which we are interested.

A line is composed of infinitely many points. To each point we can
associate a unique number, and with each number, we can associate a
particular point.

Coordinate
The number associated with a point on the number line is called the
coordinate of the point.

Graph
The point on a number line that is associated with a particular number is
called the graph of that number.

Constructing a Real Number Line
We construct a real number line as follows:

   1. Draw a horizontal line.

   2. Origin
      Choose any point on the line and label it 0. This point is called the
      origin.
   3. Choose a convenient length. Starting at 0, mark this length off in both
      direct­ions, being careful to have the lengths look like they are about
      the same.

We now define a real number.
Real Number
A real number is any number that is the coordinate of a point on the real
number line.
Positive Numbers, Negative Numbers
Real numbers whose graphs are to the right of 0 are called positive real
numbers, or more simply, positive numbers. Real numbers whose graphs
appear to the left of 0 are called negative real numbers, or more simply,
negative numbers.

The number 0 is neither positive nor negative.

Subsets of Real Numbers

The set of real numbers has many subsets. Some of the subsets that are of
interest in the study of algebra are listed below along with their notations
and graphs.
Natural Numbers, Counting Numbers
The natural or counting numbers (N): 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . Read "and so on."
Whole Numbers
The whole numbers (W ): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .

Notice that every natural number is a whole number.
Integers
The integers (Z): . . . -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .

Notice that every whole number is an integer.

Rational Numbers (Fractions)
The rational numbers (Q): Rational numbers are sometimes called
fractions. They are numbers that can be written as the quotient of two
integers. They have decimal representations that either terminate or do not
terminate but contain a repeating block of digits. Some examples are

-3               8  11  = 8.407407407 . . .

        = -0.75     27

  4              Nonterminating, but repeating

    Terminating

Some rational numbers are graphed below.

Notice that every integer is a rational number.

Notice that there are still a great many points on the number line that have
not yet been assigned a type of number. We will not examine these other
types of numbers in this text. They are examined in detail in algebra. An
example of these numbers is the number , whose decimal representation
does not terminate nor contain a repeating block of digits. An
approximation for  is 3.14.

Sample Set A

Ordering Real Numbers

Ordering Real Numbers
A real number b is said to be greater than a real number a, denoted b > a,
if b is to the right of a on the number line. Thus, as we would expect, 5 > 2
since 5 is to the right of 2 on the number line. Also, -2 > -5 since -2 is to
the right of -5 on the number line.

If we let a and b represent two numbers, then a and b are related in exactly
one of three ways: Either

Equality Symbol          (8 = 8)

a = b a and b are equal

Inequality Symbols                    (8 > 5)

     a > b a is greater than b

a < b a is less than b                (5 < 8)

Some variations of these symbols are

a  b a is not equal to b              (8  5)

a  b a is greater than or equal to b  (a  8)

a  b a is less than or equal to b     (a  8)

Sample Set B

Example:
What integers can replace x so that the following statement is true?

-3  x < 2

The integers are -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.
Example:

numbers between and including -1 and 3.

Signed Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade
Ellis, Jr. This module discusses signed numbers. By the end of the module students be
able to distinguish between positive and negative real numbers, be able to read signed
numbers and understand the origin and use of the double-negative product property.

      Reading Signed Numbers
      Opposites
      The Double-Negative Property

Positive and Negative Numbers

Positive and Negative Numbers
Each real number other than zero has a sign associated with it. A real number is said
to be a positive number if it is to the right of 0 on the number line and negative if it
is to the left of 0 on the number line.

Note:
THE NOTATION OF SIGNED NUMBERS
+ and - Notation
A number is denoted as positive if it is directly preceded by a plus sign or no sign at
all.
A number is denoted as negative if it is directly preceded by a minus sign.

Reading Signed Numbers

The plus and minus signs now have two meanings:

The plus sign can denote the operation of addition or a positive number.

The minus sign can denote the operation of subtraction or a negative number.

To avoid any confusion between "sign" and "operation," it is preferable to read the
sign of a number as "positive" or "negative." When "+" is used as an operation sign, it
is read as "plus." When "-" is used as an operation sign, it is read as "minus."
Sample Set A
Read each expression so as to avoid confusion between "operation" and "sign."

Example:
-8 should be read as "negative eight" rather than "minus eight."

Example:
4 + (-2) should be read as "four plus negative two" rather than "four plus minus
two."

Example:
-6 + (-3)should be read as "negative six plus negative three" rather than "minus
six plus minus three."

Example:
-15 - (-6)should be read as "negative fifteen minus negative six" rather than
"minus fifteen minus minus six."

Example:
-5 + 7 should be read as "negative five plus seven" rather than "minus five plus
seven."

Example:
0 - 2 should be read as "zero minus two."

Exercise:

   Problem: -1 - (-8)
   Solution:
   negative one minus negative eight
Exercise:

   Problem: 0 + (-11)
   Solution:
   zero plus negative eleven

Opposites

Opposites
On the number line, each real number, other than zero, has an image on the opposite
side of 0. For this reason, we say that each real number has an opposite. Opposites
are the same distance from zero but have opposite signs.
The opposite of a real number is denoted by placing a negative sign directly in front
of the number. Thus, if a is any real number, then -a is its opposite.

Note:The letter "a" is a variable. Thus, "a" need not be positive, and "-a" need not
be negative.

If a is any real number, -a is opposite a on the number line.

The Double-Negative Property

The number a is opposite -a on the number line. Therefore, -(-a) is opposite -a
on the number line. This means that

-(-a) = a

From this property of opposites, we can suggest the double-negative property for real
numbers.
Double-Negative Property: -(-a) = a
If a is a real number, then

-(-a) = a
Sample Set B
Find the opposite of each number.

Example:
If a = 2, then -a = -2. Also, -(-a) = -(-2) = 2.

Example:
If a = -4, then -a = -(-4) = 4. Also, -(-a) = a = -4.

Absolute Value
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses absolute value. By the end of the
module students should understand the geometric and algebraic definitions
of absolute value.

Section Overview

      Geometric Definition of Absolute Value
      Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value

Geometric Definition of Absolute Value

Absolute Value-Geometric Approach
Geometric definition of absolute value:
The absolute value of a number a, denoted  a , is the distance from a to 0
on the number line.

Absolute value answers the question of "how far," and not "which way."
The phrase "how far" implies "length" and length is always a nonnegative
quantity. Thus, the absolute value of a number is a nonnegative number.

Sample Set A

Determine each value.

Example:

 4 = 4
Example:

 -4 = 4

Example:

 0 = 0

Example:
-  5 = -5. The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as
"negative the absolute value of 5." The absolute value of 5 is 5. Hence,
negative the absolute value of 5 is -5.

Example:
-  -3 = -3. The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as
"negative the absolute value of -3." The absolute value of -3 is 3. Hence,
negative the absolute value of -3 is -(3) = -3.

Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value

From the problems in [link], we can suggest the following algebraic defini-­
tion of absolute value. Note that the definition has two parts.

Absolute Value--Algebraic Approach
Algebraic definition of absolute value
The absolute value of a number a is

                   a,   if a  0
|a| = {                 if < 0

                   -a,

The algebraic definition takes into account the fact that the number a could
be either positive or zero (a  0) or negative (a < 0).

1. If the number a is positive or zero (a  0), the upper part of the
  definition applies. The upper part of the definition tells us that if the
  number enclosed in the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number,
  the absolute value of the number is the number itself.

2. The lower part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed
  within the absolute value bars is a negative number, the absolute value
  of the number is the opposite of the number. The opposite of a
  negative number is a positive number.

Note:The definition says that the vertical absolute value lines may be
elimi­nated only if we know whether the number inside is positive or
negative.

Sample Set B
Use the algebraic definition of absolute value to find the following values.
Example:
 8 . The number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a nonnegative
number, so the upper part of the definition applies. This part says that the
absolute value of 8 is 8 itself.

 8 = 8

Example:
 -3 . The number enclosed within absolute value bars is a negative
number, so the lower part of the definition applies. This part says that the
absolute value of -3 is the opposite of -3, which is -(-3). By the
definition of absolute value and the double-negative property,

 -3 = -(-3) = 3

Practice Set B
Use the algebraic definition of absolute value to find the following values.

Addition of Signed Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to add signed numbers. By
the end of the module students should be able to add numbers with like
signs and with unlike signs and be able to use the calculator for addition of
signed numbers.

Section Overview

      Addition of Numbers with Like Signs
      Addition with Zero
      Addition of Numbers with Unlike Signs
      Calculators

Addition of Numbers with Like Signs

The addition of the two positive numbers 2 and 3 is performed on the
number line as follows.
Begin at 0, the origin.
Since 2 is positive, move 2 units to the right.
Since 3 is positive, move 3 more units to the right.
We are now located at 5.

Thus, 2 + 3 = 5.
Summarizing, we have

(2 positive units) + (3 positive units) = (5 positive units)
The addition of the two negative numbers -2 and -3 is performed on the
number line as follows.
Begin at 0, the origin.
Since -2 is negative, move 2 units to the left.
Since -3 is negative, move 3 more units to the left.
We are now located at -5.

Thus, (-2) + (-3) = -5.
Summarizing, we have

(2 negative units) + (3 negative units) = (5 negative units)

Observing these two examples, we can suggest these relationships:

(positive number) + (positive number) = (positive number)
(negative number) + (negative number) = (negative number)

Adding Numbers with the Same Sign
Addition of numbers with like sign:
To add two real numbers that have the same sign, add the absolute values of
the numbers and associate with the sum the common sign.

Sample Set A
Find the sums.
Example:

3+7
|3| = 3

             } Add these absolute values.

|7| = 7
3 + 7 = 10

The common sign is "+."
Thus, 3 + 7 = +10, or 3 + 7 = 10.

Example:

(-4) + (-9)
|-4| = 4

               } Add these absolute values.

|-9| = 9
4 + 9 = 13

The common sign is "-."
Thus, (-4) + (-9) = -13.

Addition With Zero

Addition with Zero
Notice that
(0) + (a positive number) = (that same positive number).
(0) + (a negative number) = (that same negative number).
The Additive Identity Is Zero
Since adding zero to a real number leaves that number unchanged, zero is
called the additive identity.

Addition of Numbers with Unlike Signs

The addition 2 + (-6), two numbers with unlike signs, can also be
illustrated using the number line.
Begin at 0, the origin.
Since 2 is positive, move 2 units to the right.
Since -6 is negative, move, from 2, 6 units to the left.
We are now located at -4.
We can suggest a rule for adding two numbers that have unlike signs by
noting that if the signs are disregarded, 4 can be obtained by subtracting 2
from 6. But 2 and 6 are precisely the absolute values of 2 and -6. Also,
notice that the sign of the number with the larger absolute value is negative
and that the sign of the resulting sum is negative.

Adding Numbers with Unlike Signs
Addition of numbers with unlike signs: To add two real numbers that have
unlike signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute
value and associate with this difference the sign of the number with the
larger absolute value.

Sample Set B
Find the following sums.

Example:                  |-2| = 2

7 + (-2)
           |7| = 7

Larger absolute           Smaller absolute

value. Sign is positive.  value.

Subtract absolute values: 7 - 2 = 5.
Attach the proper sign: "+."
Thus, 7 + (-2) = +5 or 7 + (-2) = 5.

Example:

3 + (-11)
|3| = 3           |-11| = 11

Smaller absolute  Larger absolute

value.            value. Sign is negative.

Subtract absolute values: 11 - 3 = 8.
Attach the proper sign: "-."
Thus, 3 + (-11) = -8.

Example:
The morning temperature on a winter's day in Lake Tahoe was -12 degrees.
The afternoon temperature was 25 degrees warmer. What was the
afternoon temperature?
We need to find -12 + 25.

|-12| = 12        |25| = 25

Smaller absolute  Larger absolute

value.            value. Sign is positive.

Subtract absolute values: 25 - 12 = 16.
Attach the proper sign: "+."
Thus, -12 + 25 = 13.

Subtraction of Signed Numbers
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to subtract signed numbers.
By the end of the module students should understand the definition of
subtraction, be able to subtract signed numbers and be able to use a
calculator to subtract signed numbers.

Section Overview

      Definition of Subtraction
      The Process of Subtraction
      Calculators

Definition of Subtraction

We know from experience with arithmetic that the subtraction 5 - 2
produces 3, that is 5 - 2 = 3. We can suggest a rule for subtracting signed
numbers by illust­rating this process on the number line.

Begin at 0, the origin.

Since 5 is positive, move 5 units to the right.

Then, move 2 units to the left to get to 6. (This reminds us of addition with
a negative number.)

From this illustration we can see that 5 - 2 is the same as 5 + (-2). This
leads us directly to the definition of subtraction.

Definition of Subtraction
If a and b are real numbers, a - b is the same as a + (-b), where -b is the
opposite of b.
The Process of Subtraction

From this definition, we suggest the following rule for subtracting signed
numbers.
Subtraction of Signed Numbers
To perform the subtraction a - b, add the opposite of b to a, that is, change
the sign of b and add.

Sample Set A
Perform the indicated subtractions.

Example:

5 - 3 = 5 + (-3) = 2

Example:

4 - 9 = 4 + (-9) = -5

Example:

-4 - 6 = -4 + (-6) = -10

Example:

-3 - (-12) = -3 + 12 = 9

Example:
0 - (-15) = 0 + 15 = 15

Example:
The high temperature today in Lake Tahoe was 26°F. The low temperature
tonight is expected to be -7°F. How many degrees is the temperature
expected to drop?
We need to find the difference between 26 and -7.

26 - (-7) = 26 + 7 = 33

Thus, the expected temperature drop is 33°F.

Example:

 -6 - (-5) - 10 = -6 + 5 + (-10)
                                               = (-6 + 5) + (-10)
                                               = -1 + (-10)
                                               = -11

Multiplication of Signed Numbers

Let us consider first, the product of two positive numbers. Multiply: 3  5.

3  5 means 5 + 5 + 5 = 15

This suggests[footnote] that
In later mathematics courses, the word "suggests" turns into the word
"proof." One example does not prove a claim. Mathematical proofs are
constructed to validate a claim for all possible cases.

(positive number)  (positive number) = (positive number)

More briefly,

(+)(+) = (+)

Now consider the product of a positive number and a negative number.
Multiply: (3)(-5).

(3)(-5) means (-5) + (-5) + (-5) = -15

This suggests that
(positive number)  (negative number) = (negative number)

More briefly,

(+)(-) = (-)

By the commutative property of multiplication, we get

(negative number)  (positive number) = (negative number)

More briefly,

(-)(+) = (-)

The sign of the product of two negative numbers can be suggested after
observing the following illustration.
Multiply -2 by, respectively, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4.

We have the following rules for multiplying signed numbers.
Rules for Multiplying Signed Numbers
Multiplying signed numbers:

   1. To multiply two real numbers that have the same sign, multiply their
      absolute values. The product is positive.
           (+)(+) = (+)
           (-)(-) = (+)

   2. To multiply two real numbers that have opposite signs, multiply their
      absol­ute values. The product is negative.

           (+)(-) = (-)
           (-)(+) = (-)

Sample Set A
Find the following products.

Example:

86
|8| = 8

             } Multiply these absolute values.

|6| = 6
8  6 = 48

Since the numbers have the same sign, the product is positive.
Thus, 8  6=+48, or 8  6 = 48.

Example:

(-8)(-6)
|-8| = 8

               } Multiply these absolute values.

|-6| = 6
8  6 = 48

Since the numbers have the same sign, the product is positive.
Thus, (-8)(-6)=+48, or (-8)(-6) = 48.

Example:

(-4)(7)
|-4| = 4

               } Multiply these absolute values.

   |7| = 7
4  7 = 28

Since the numbers have opposite signs, the product is negative.
Thus, (-4)(7) = -28.

Example:

6(-3)
   |6| = 6

               } Multiply these absolute values.

|-3| = 3
6  3 = 18

Since the numbers have opposite signs, the product is negative.
Thus, 6(-3) = -18.

Division of Signed Numbers

To determine the signs in a division problem, recall that
12 = 4 since 12 = 3  4

   3
This suggests that

(+)  = (+)
(+)
(+)  = (+) since (+) = (+)(+)
(+)

What is 12 ?
                             -3

-12 = (-3)(-4) suggests that 12 = -4. That is,
                                                                                                              -3

(+)  = (-)
(-)

(+) = (-)(-)                                                                   (+)

                                 suggests that = (-)
                                 (-)

What is 3 -12 ?
-12 = (3)(-4) suggests that 3 = -4 -12 . That is,

(-)  = (-)
(+)

(-) = (+)(-) suggests that       (-)

                                      = (-)

                                 (+)

What is -3 -12 ?

-12 = (-3)(4) suggests that -3 = 4 -12 . That is,

(-)  = (+)
(-)

(-) = (-)(+) suggests that       (-)

                                      = (+)

                                 (-)

We have the following rules for dividing signed numbers.

Rules for Dividing Signed Numbers
Dividing signed numbers:

   1. To divide two real numbers that have the same sign, divide their
      absolute values. The quotient is positive.
     (+)  = (+)  (-)       = (+)
     (+)         (-)

2. To divide two real numbers that have opposite signs, divide their

     absolute values. The quotient is negative.

     (-)  = (-)  (+)       = (-)
     (+)         (-)

Sample Set B
Find the following quotients.

Example:

-10

2

|-10| = 10

                  } Divide these absolute values.

|2|       =2

 10

        =5

   2

Since the numbers have opposite signs, the quotient is negative.

Thus -10 = -5.
                        2

Example:

 -35

   -7

|-35| = 35

                  } Divide these absolute values.

 |-7| = 7

 35

        =5

   7

Since the numbers have the same signs, the quotient is positive.
Thus, -35 = 5.

                        -7

Example:

  18
 -9
 |18| = 18

                 } Divide these absolute values.

|-9| = 9

   18

         =2

    9

Since the numbers have opposite signs, the quotient is negative.
Thus, -9 18 = 2.

Sample Set C

Example:

Find the value of -6(4-7)-2(8-9) .
                                                                     -(4+1)+1

Using the order of operations and what we know about signed numbers, we

get,

-6(4-7)-2(8-9)     =  -6(-3)-2(-1)
         -(4+1)+1              -(5)+1

                   =  18+2
                      -5+1

                   = mfrac

                   = -5

Sample Set D
Use a calculator to find each quotient or product.

Example:

(-186)  (-43)

Since this product involves a (negative)  (negative), we know the result
should be a positive number. We'll illustrate this on the calculator.

Press           =

Thus, (-186)  (-43) = 7,998.

Example:

Summary of Key Concepts
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module reviews the key concepts from the chapter
"Signed Numbers."

Summary of Key Concepts

Variables and Constants ([link])
A variable is a letter or symbol that represents any member of a set of two
or more numbers. A constant is a letter or symbol that represents a specific
number. For example, the Greek letter  (pi) represents the constant
3.14159 . . . .

The Real Number Line ([link])
The real number line allows us to visually display some of the numbers in
which we are interested.

Coordinate and Graph ([link])
The number associated with a point on the number line is called the
coordinate of the point. The point associated with a number is called the
graph of the number.

Real Number ([link])
A real number is any number that is the coordinate of a point on the real
number line.

Types of Real Numbers ([link])
The set of real numbers has many subsets. The ones of most interest to us
are:
The natural numbers: {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}
The whole numbers: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}
The integers: {. . . ,-3,-2,-1,0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}
The rational numbers: {All numbers that can be expressed as the quotient
of two integers.}
Positive and Negative Numbers ([link])
A number is denoted as positive if it is directly preceded by a plus sign (+)
or no sign at all. A number is denoted as negative if it is directly preceded
by a minus sign (-).

Opposites ([link])
Opposites are numbers that are the same distance from zero on the number
line but have opposite signs. The numbers a and -a are opposites.

Double-Negative Property ([link])

-(-a) = a

Absolute Value (Geometric) ([link])
The absolute value of a number a, denoted  a , is the distance from a to 0
on the number line.

Absolute Value (Algebraic) ([link])

                   a,   if a  0
|a| = {                 if a < 0

                   -a,

Addition of Signed Numbers ([link])
To add two numbers with

1. like signs, add the absolute values of the numbers and associate with
  the sum the common sign.

2. unlike signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger
  absolute value and associate with the difference the sign of the larger
  absolute value.

Addition with Zero ([link])
0 + (any number) = that particular number.

Additive Identity ([link])
Since adding 0 to any real number leaves that number unchanged, 0 is
called the additive identity.

Definition of Subtraction ([link])

a - b = a + (-b)
Subtraction of Signed Numbers ([link])
To perform the subtraction a - b, add the opposite of b to a, that is,
change the sign of b and follow the addition rules ([link]).

Multiplication and Division of Signed Numbers ([link])

(+)(+) = (+)  (+)  = (+)  (+)  = (-)
              (+)         (-)

(-)(-) = (+)  (-)  = (+)  (-)  = (-)
(+)(-) = (-)  (-)         (+)

(-)(+) = (-)

Algebraic Expressions
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module
discusses algebraic expressions. By the end of the module students should be able to recognize an algebraic
expression, be able to distinguish between terms and factors, understand the meaning and function of
coefficients and be able to perform numerical evaluation.

Algebraic Expressions

Numerical Expression
In arithmetic, a numerical expression results when numbers are connected by arithmetic operation signs (+, -,
 , ÷). For example, 8 + 5, 4 - 9, 3  8, and 9 ÷ 7 are numerical expressions.

Algebraic Expression
In algebra, letters are used to represent numbers, and an algebraic expression results when an arithmetic
operation sign associates a letter with a number or a letter with a letter. For example, x + 8, 4 - y , 3  x ,
x ÷ 7 , and x  y are algebraic expressions.

Expressions
Numerical expressions and algebraic expressions are often referred to simply as expressions.

Terms and Factors

In algebra, it is extremely important to be able to distinguish between terms and factors.

Distinction Between Terms and Factors
Terms are parts of sums and are therefore connected by + signs.
Factors are parts of products and are therefore separated by  signs.

Note:While making the distinction between sums and products, we must rem­ ember that subtraction and
division are functions of these operations.

1. In some expressions it will appear that terms are separated by minus signs. We must keep in mind that
  subtraction is addition of the opposite, that is,

x - y = x + (-y)

2. In some expressions it will appear that factors are separated by division signs. We must keep in mind that

x     x1          1

   =      = x

y     1y          y

Sample Set A
State the number of terms in each expression and name them.
Example:
x + 4. In this expression, x and 4 are connected by a "+" sign. Therefore, they are terms. This expression
consists of two terms.

Example:
y - 8. The expression y - 8 can be expressed as y + (-8). We can now see that this express­ ion consists of
the two terms y and -8.
Rather than rewriting the expression when a subtraction occurs, we can identify terms more quickly by
associating the + or - sign with the individual quantity.

Example:
a + 7 - b - m. Associating the sign with the individual quantities, we see that this expression consists of the
four terms a, 7, -b, -m.

Example:
5m - 8n. This expression consists of the two terms, 5m and -8n. Notice that the term 5m is composed of
the two factors 5 and m. The term -8n is composed of the two factors -8 and n.

Example:
3x. This expression consists of one term. Notice that 3x can be expressed as 3x + 0 or 3x  1 (indicating the
connecting signs of arithmetic). Note that no operation sign is necessary for multiplication.

Practice Set A
Specify the terms in each expression.
Exercise:

   Problem: x + 7
   Solution:
   x, 7
Exercise:

   Problem: 3m - 6n
   Solution:

     3m - 6n

Exercise:

   Problem: 5y
   Solution:

     5y

Exercise:

   Problem: a + 2b - c

   Solution:

     a, 2b, -c

Exercise:

   Problem: -3x - 5

   Solution:

     -3x, - 5

Coefficients

We know that multiplication is a description of repeated addition. For example,
5  7 describes 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7

Suppose some quantity is represented by the letter x. The multiplication 5x des­ cribes x + x + x + x + x. It is
now easy to see that 5x specifies 5 of the quantities represented by x. In the expression 5x, 5 is called the
numerical coefficient, or more simply, the coefficient of x.

Coefficient
The coefficient of a quantity records how many of that quantity there are.

Since constants alone do not record the number of some quantity, they are not usually considered as numerical
coefficients. For example, in the expression 7x + 2y - 8z + 12, the coefficient of

7x is 7. (There are 7 x's.)
2y is 2. (There are 2 y 's.)
-8z is -8. (There are -8z 's.)

The constant 12 is not considered a numerical coefficient.

1x = x

When the numerical coefficient of a variable is 1, we write only the variable and not the coefficient. For
example, we write x rather than 1x. It is clear just by looking at x that there is only one.

Numerical Evaluation

We know that a variable represents an unknown quantity. Therefore, any express­ ion that contains a variable
represents an unknown quantity. For example, if the value of x is unknown, then the value of 3x + 5 is
unknown. The value of 3x + 5 depends on the value of x.

Numerical Evaluation
Numerical evaluation is the process of determining the numerical value of an algebraic expression by
replacing the variables in the expression with specified numbers.
Sample Set B

Find the value of each expression.

Example:
2x + 7y, if x = -4 and y = 2
Replace x with -4 and y with 2.

 2x + 7y = 2(-4) + 7(2)
                         = -8 + 14
                         =6

Thus, when x =- 4 and y = 2, 2x + 7y = 6.

Example:

5a     8b
    + , if a = 6 and b = -3.

b      12

Replace a with 6 and b with -3.

5a  +  8b  =  5(6)  +  8(-3)
               -3          12
b      12

           = mfrac + mfrac

           = -10 + (-2)

           = -12

                               5a  8b
Thus, when a = 6 and b = -3, + = -12.

                               b   12

Example:
6(2a - 15b), if a = -5 and b = -1
Replace a with -5 and b with -1.

6(2a - 15b) = 6(2(-5) - 15(-1))

                                   = 6(-10 + 15)

                                   = 6(5)

                                   = 30

Thus, when a = -5 and b = -1, 6(2a - 15b) = 30.

Example:
3x - 2x + 1 2 , if x = 4
Replace x with 4.

3x2 2 - 2x + 1 = 3(4) - 2(4) + 1

                                      = 3  16 - 2(4) + 1

                                      = 48 - 8 + 1

                                      = 41

Thus, when x = 4, 3x - 2x + 1 = 41 2 .
Example:

-x2 - 4, if x = 3

Replace x with 3.

2                  3
-x - 4 = - - 4            Be caref ul to square only the 3. The exponent 2 is connected only to 3, not -3
                   2

           = -9 - 4

           = -13

Example:

                  2

(-x) - 4, if x = 3.

Replace x with 3.

   2                  2

(-x) - 4 = (-3) - 4       The exponent is connected to -3, not 3 as in problem 5 above.

           = 9-4

                               = -5

The exponent is connected to -3, not 3 as in the problem above.

This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses how to combine like terms using
addition and subtraction. By the end of the module students should be able
to combine like terms in an algebraic expression.

Section Overview

      Combining Like Terms

Combining Like Terms

From our examination of terms in [link], we know that like terms are terms
in which the variable parts are identical. Like terms is an appropriate name
since terms with identical variable parts and different numerical coefficients
represent different amounts of the same quantity. When we are dealing with
quantities of the same type, we may combine them using addition and
subtraction.

Simplifying an Algebraic Expression
An algebraic expression may be simplified by combining like terms.

This concept is illustrated in the following examples.

   1. 8 records + 5 records = 13 records.

      Eight and 5 of the same type give 13 of that type. We have combined
      quantities of the same type.
   2. 8 records + 5 records + 3 tapes = 13 records + 3 tapes.

      Eight and 5 of the same type give 13 of that type. Thus, we have 13 of
      one type and 3 of another type. We have combined only quantities of
      the same type.
   3. Suppose we let the letter x represent "record." Then, 8x + 5x = 13x.
      The terms 8x and 5x are like terms. So, 8 and 5 of the same type give
      13 of that type. We have combined like terms.
   4. Suppose we let the letter x represent "record" and y represent "tape."
      Then,

           8x + 5x + 3y = 13x + 5y

      We have combined only the like terms.
After observing the problems in these examples, we can suggest a method
for simplifying an algebraic expression by combining like terms.
Combining Like Terms
Like terms may be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients and
affixing the result to the common variable.

Sample Set A
Simplify each expression by combining like terms.

Example:
2m + 6m - 4m. All three terms are alike. Combine their coefficients and
affix this result to m: 2 + 6 - 4 = 4.
Thus, 2m + 6m - 4m = 4m .

Example:
5x + 2y - 9y. The terms 2y and -9y are like terms. Combine their
coefficients: 2 - 9 = -7.
Thus, 5x + 2y - 9y = 5x - 7y .

Example:
-3a + 2b - 5a + a + 6b. The like terms are
-3a, - 5a, a 2b, 6b

-3-5+1=-7  2+6=8

-7a        8b

Thus, -3a + 2b - 5a + a + 6b= - 7a + 8b.

Example:
r - 2s + 7s + 3r - 4r - 5s . The like terms are

Thus, r - 2s + 7s + 3r - 4r - 5s = 0 .

Solving Equations of the Form x+a=b and x-a=b
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis,
Jr. This module discusses how to solve equations of the form x + a = b and x - a = b.
By the end of the module students should understand the meaning and function of an
equation, understand what is meant by the solution to an equation and be able to solve
equations of the form x + a = b and x - a = b.

Equations

Equation
An equation is a statement that two algebraic expressions are equal.

The following are examples of equations:

x+6 =         10  x - 4 = -11 3y - 5 = -2 + 2y

This   This       This  This              This                       This
                                                              expression
expression = expression expression = expression expression =

Notice that x + 6, x - 4, and 3y - 5 are not equations. They are expressions. They are
not equations because there is no statement that each of these expressions is equal to
another expression.

Solutions and Equivalent Equations

Conditional Equations
The truth of some equations is conditional upon the value chosen for the variable. Such
equations are called conditional equations. There are two additional types of equations.
They are examined in courses in algebra, so we will not consider them now.

Solutions and Solving an Equation
The set of values that, when substituted for the variables, make the equation true, are
called the solutions of the equation.
An equation has been solved when all its solutions have been found.

Sample Set A
Example:
Verify that 3 is a solution to x + 7 = 10.
When x = 3,

                           x + 7 = 10

becomes 3 + 7 = 10

                                  10 = 10 which is a true statement, verif ying that

                                                                  3 is a solution to x + 7 = 10

Example:
Verify that -6 is a solution to 5y + 8 = -22
When y = -6,

                                    5y + 8 = -22

becomes 5(-6) + 8 = -22

                               -30 + 8 = -22

                                          -22 = -22 which is a true statement, verif ying that

                                                                                   -6 is a solution to5y + 8 = -22

Example:
Verify that 5 is not a solution to a - 1 = 2a + 3.
When a = 5,

                           a - 1 = 2a + 3

becomes 5 - 1 = 2  5 + 3

5 - 1 = 10 + 3

4 = 13                    a f alse statement, verif ying that 5

                          is not a solution to a - 1 = 2a + 3

Example:
Verify that -2 is a solution to 3m - 2 = -4m - 16.
When m = -2,

                                  3m - 2 = -4m - 16

becomes 3(-2) - 2 = -4(-2) - 16

-6 - 2 = 8 - 16

-8 = -8                          which is a true statement, verif ying that

                                 -2 is a solution to 3m - 2 = -4m - 16
Practice Set A
Exercise:

   Problem: Verify that 5 is a solution to m + 6 = 11.
   Solution:
   Substitute 5 into m + 6 = 11.

   Thus, 5 is a solution.
Exercise:

   Problem: Verify that -5 is a solution to 2m - 4 = -14.
   Solution:
   Substitute -5 into 2m - 4 = -14.

   Thus, -5 is a solution.
Exercise:

   Problem: Verify that 0 is a solution to 5x + 1 = 1.
   Solution:
   Substitute 0 into 5x + 1 = 1.

   Thus, 0 is a solution.
Exercise:

   Problem: Verify that 3 is not a solution to -3y + 1 = 4y + 5.
   Solution:
   Substitute 3 into -3y + 1 = 4y + 5.

   Thus, 3 is not a solution.
Exercise:

   Problem: Verify that -1 is a solution to 6m - 5 + 2m = 7m - 6.
   Solution:
   Substitute -1 into 6m - 5 + 2m = 7m - 6.

   Thus, -1 is a solution.
Equivalent Equations
Some equations have precisely the same collection of solutions. Such equations are called
equivalent equations. For example, x - 5 = -1, x + 7 = 11, and x = 4 are all
equivalent equations since the only solution to each is x = 4. (Can you verify this?)

Solving Equations

We know that the equal sign of an equation indicates that the number represented by the
expression on the left side is the same as the number represented by the expression on the
right side.

This number  is the same as  this number
                             
             =               4

x+7  =  11

x-5  =  -1

Addition/Subtraction Property of Equality
From this, we can suggest the addition/subtraction property of equality.
Given any equation,

   1. We can obtain an equivalent equation by adding the same number to both sides of the
      equation.

   2. We can obtain an equivalent equation by subtracting the same number from both
      sides of the equation.

The Idea Behind Equation Solving
The idea behind equation solving is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.
Signs of operation (+, -, ,÷) are used to associate two numbers. For example, in the
expression 5 + 3, the numbers 5 and 3 are associated by addition. An association can be
undone by performing the opposite operation. The addition/subtraction property of
equality can be used to undo an association that is made by addition or subtraction.

Subtraction is used to undo an addition.

Addition is used to undo a subtraction.

The procedure is illustrated in the problems of [link].

Sample Set B
Use the addition/subtraction property of equality to solve each equation.

Example:
x + 4 = 6.
4 is associated with x by addition. Undo the association by subtracting 4 from both sides.

x+4-4 = 6-4

x+0 = 2

x=2

Check: When x = 2, x + 4 becomes
The solution to x + 4 = 6 is x = 2.

Example:
m - 8 = 5. 8 is associated with m by subtraction. Undo the association by adding 8 to
both sides.

m-8+8 = 5+8
m + 0 = 13
m = 13

Check: When m = 13,
becomes

a true statement.
The solution to m - 8 = 5 is m = 13.

Example:
-3 - 5 = y - 2 + 8. Before we use the addition/subtraction property, we should
simplify as much as possible.

-3 - 5 = y - 2 + 8
-8 = y + 6

6 is associated with y by addition. Undo the association by subtracting 6 from both sides.

-8 - 6 = y + 6 - 6
-14 = y + 0
-14 = y

This is equivalent to y = -14.
Check: When y = -14,

-3 - 5 = y - 2 + 8

becomes

,
a true statement.
The solution to -3 - 5 = y - 2 + 8 is y = -14.
Example:
-5a + 1 + 6a = -2. Begin by simplifying the left side of the equation.

-5a + 1 + 6a = -2

             -5+6=1

a + 1 = -2 1 is associated with a by addition. Undo the association by subtracting 1
from both sides.

a + 1 - 1 = -2 - 1

a + 0 = -3

a = -3

Check: When a = -3,

-5a + 1 + 6a = -2

becomes

,
a true statement.
The solution to -5a + 1 + 6a = -2 is a = -3.

Example:
7k - 4 = 6k + 1. In this equation, the variable appears on both sides. We need to isolate
it on one side. Although we can choose either side, it will be more convenient to choose
the side with the larger coefficient. Since 8 is greater than 6, we'll isolate k on the left
side.
7k - 4 = 6k + 1 Since 6k represents +6k, subtract 6k from each side.

7k - 4 - 6k = 6k + 1 - 6k

7-6=1        6-6=0

k - 4 = 1 4 is associated with k by subtraction. Undo the association by adding 4 to both
sides.

k-4+4 = 1+4

k=5

Check: When k = 5,

7k - 4 = 6k + 1

becomes
a true statement.
The solution to 7k - 4 = 6k + 1 is k = 5.

Example:
-8 + x = 5. -8 is associated with x by addition. Undo the by subtracting -8 from both
sides. Subtracting -8 we get -(-8)=+8. We actually add 8 to both sides.

-8 + x + 8 = 5 + 8
x = 13

Check: When x = 13

-8 + x = 5

becomes

,
a true statement.
The solution to -8 + x = 5 is x = 13.

Multiplication/ Division Property of Equality

Recall that the equal sign of an equation indicates that the number
represented by the expression on the left side is the same as the number
represented by the expression on the right side. From this, we can suggest
the multiplication/division property of equality.

Multiplication/Division Property of Equality
Given any equation,

1. We can obtain an equivalent equation by multiplying both sides of the
  equat­ion by the same nonzero number, that is, if c  0, then a = b is
  equivalent to

     ac = bc

2. We can obtain an equivalent equation by dividing both sides of the
  equation by the same nonzero number, that is, if c  0, then a = b is
  equivalent to

a     b

   =

c     c

The multiplication/division property of equality can be used to undo an
association with a number that multiplies or divides the variable.
Sample Set A
Use the multiplication / division property of equality to solve each equation.

Example:

6y = 54

6 is associated with y by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing

both sides by 6

6y       54

    =

6         6

          9

6y        54

    =

6         6

      y=9

Check: When y = 9

6y = 54

becomes

,
a true statement.
The solution to 6y = 54 is y = 9.

Example:

x

    = 27.

-2

-2 is associated with x by division. Undo the association by multiplying

both sides by -2.

(-2)  x      = (-2)27

      -2
                               x  = (-2)27

( -2 )

                             -2

x = -54

Check: When x = -54,

   x
            = 27

 -2

becomes

a true statement.

The solution to                   x   = 27 is x = -54

                                  -2

Example:

 3a

     = 6.

  7

We will examine two methods for solving equations such as this one.
Method 1: Use of dividing out common factors.

 3a
          =6

  7

7 is associated with a by division. Undo the association by multiplying
both sides by 7.

   3a

7        = 76

   7

Divide out the 7's.

   3a

7        = 42

      7

3a = 42

3 is associated with a by multiplication. Undo the association by dviding
both sides by 3.
3a           42

        =

   3         3

   3a     = 14
    3

a = 14

Check: When a = 14,

 3a
          =6

  7

becomes

,

a true statement.

                                      3a

The solution to = 6 is a = 14.

                                       7

Method 2: Use of reciprocals

Recall that if the product of two numbers is 1, the numbers are reciprocals.

          3           7
Thus and are reciprocals.

          7           3

3a      =6
 7

                                          7                3
Multiply both sides of the equation by , the reciprocal of .

                                          3                7

7 3a               7

                =     6

3         7        3

   1         1                2

   7         3a          7    6

                   =        

   3         7           3    1

   1         1           1

1  a = 14

a = 14

Notice that we get the same solution using either method.
Example:

-8x = 24

-8 is associated with x by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing

both sides by -8.

-8x  =  24
 -8     -8

-8x       24

     =

-8      -8

x = -3

Check: When x = -3,

-8x = 24

becomes

,
a true statement.

Example:

-x = 7.

Since - x is actually -1  x and (-1)(-1) = 1, we can isolate x by
multiplying both sides of the equation by -1.

(-1)(-x) = -1  7
x = -7

Check: When x = 7,

-x = 7

becomes

The solution to -x = 7 is x = -7.

Combining Techniques in Equation Solving

Having examined solving equations using the addition/subtraction and the
multi­plication/division principles of equality, we can combine these
techniques to solve more complicated equations.

When beginning to solve an equation such as 6x - 4 = -16, it is helpful
to know which property of equality to use first, addition/subtraction or
multiplication/di­vision. Recalling that in equation solving we are trying to
isolate the variable (disass­ ociate numbers from it), it is helpful to note the
following.

To associate numbers and letters, we use the order of operations.

   1. Multiply/divide
   2. Add/subtract

To undo an association between numbers and letters, we use the order of
opera­tions in reverse.

   1. Add/subtract
   2. Multiply/divide
Sample Set B

Solve each equation. (In these example problems, we will not show the
checks.)

Example:

6x - 4 = -16

-4 is associated with x by subtraction. Undo the association by adding 4 to
both sides.

6x - 4 + 4 = -16 + 4

6x = -12

6 is associated with x by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing

both sides by 6

6x     -12

    =

6       6

x = -2

Example:

-8k + 3=-45.

3 is associated with k by addition. Undo the association by subtracting 3
from both sides.

-8k + 3 - 3=-45 - 3

-8k= - 48

-8 is associated with k by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing
both sides by -8.

-8k     -48

     =

-8        -8

k=6

Example:
5m - 6 - 4m = 4m - 8 + 3m. Begin by solving this equation by
combining like terms.
m - 6 = 7m - 8 Choose a side on which to isolate m. Since 7 is greater
than 1, we'll isolate m on the right side.
Subtract m from both sides.

-m - 6 - m = 7m - 8 - m

-6 = 6m - 8

8 is associated with m by subtraction. Undo the association by adding 8 to
both sides.

-6 + 8 = 6m - 8 + 8

2 = 6m

6 is associated with m by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing

both sides by 6.

2     6m  Reduce.

   =

6     6

1
      =m

 3

Notice that if we had chosen to isolate m on the left side of the equation

rather than the right side, we would have proceeded as follows:

m - 6 = 7m - 8

Subtract 7m from both sides.

m - 6 - 7m = 7m - 8 - 7m

-6m - 6=-8

Add 6 to both sides,

-6m - 6 + 6=-8 + 6

-6m= - 2

Divide both sides by -6.

-6m       -2

-6    =
             -6

              1
m=

              3

This is the same result as with the previous approach.

Example:

 8x
         =-2

   7

7 is associated with x by division. Undo the association by multiplying
both sides by 7.

    8x

7         = 7(-2)

       7

   8x

7      = - 14

    7

8x= - 14

8 is associated with x by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing
both sides by 8.

8x        -7

       =

8         4

x=  -7

Translating Words to Symbols

Practical problems seldom, if ever, come in equation form. The job of the
problem solver is to translate the problem from phrases and statements into
mathematical expressions and equations, and then to solve the equations.

As problem solvers, our job is made simpler if we are able to translate
verbal phrases to mathematical expressions and if we follow the five-step
method of solving applied problems. To help us translate from words to
symbols, we can use the following Mathematics Dictionary.

          1                  n
Translation: n = 30, or = 30.

          5                  5

Example:

 Five times a number is two more than twice the number.

5               x         =     2       +  2  x

Translation: 5x = 2 + 2x.

   Twice a number less eight is equal to one more than three times the
   number.
   Solution:
   2x - 8 = 3x + 1 or 2x - 8 = 1 + 3x

Sample Set B

Example:
Sometimes the structure of the sentence indicates the use of grouping
symbols. We'll be alert for commas. They set off terms.

A numberdivided byf our,minus six, is twelve

                (x ÷ 4) - 6 = 12

                               x

Translation: - 6 = 12.

                               4

Example:
Some phrases and sentences do not translate directly. We must be careful to
read them properly. The word from often appears in such phrases and
sentences. The word from means "a point of departure for motion." The
following translation will illustrate this use.

Translation: x - 20.
The word from indicated the motion (subtraction) is to begin at the point of
"some number."

Example:
Ten less than some number. Notice that less than can be replaced by from.
Ten from some number.
Translation: x - 10.

Applications II: Solving Problems
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module discusses
how to solve algebraic problems. By the end of the module students should be more familiar with the five-step
method for solving applied problems and be able to use the five-step method to solve number problems and
geometry problems.

The Five Step Method

We are now in a position to solve some applied problems using algebraic methods. The problems we shall solve
are intended as logic developers. Although they may not seem to reflect real situations, they do serve as a basis for
solving more complex, real situation, applied problems. To solve problems algebraically, we will use the five-step
method.

Strategy for Reading Word Problems
When solving mathematical word problems, you may wish to apply the following "reading strategy." Read the
problem quickly to get a feel for the situation. Do not pay close attention to details. At the first reading, too much
attention to details may be overwhelming and lead to confusion and discouragement. After the first, brief reading,
read the problem carefully in phrases. Reading phrases introduces information more slowly and allows us to
absorb and put together important information. We can look for the unknown quantity by reading one phrase at a
time.
Five-Step Method for Solving Word Problems

   1. Let x (or some other letter) represent the unknown quantity.
   2. Translate the words to mathematical symbols and form an equation. Draw a picture if possible.
   3. Solve the equation.
   4. Check the solution by substituting the result into the original statement, not equation, of the problem.
   5. Write a conclusion.

If it has been your experience that word problems are difficult, then follow the five-step method carefully. Most
people have trouble with word problems for two reasons:

   1. They are not able to translate the words to mathematical symbols. (See [link].)
   2. They neglect step 1. After working through the problem phrase by phrase, to become familiar with the

      situation,

Solve this equation.
                       n - 6 = 5 Add 6 to both sides.

                  n-6+6 = 5+6

                                              n = 11

Check the result.
                    When 11 is decreased by 6, the result is 11 - 6, which is equal to 5. The solution checks.

The number is 11.

Summary of Key Concepts
This module is from Fundamentals of Mathematics by Denny Burzynski
and Wade Ellis, Jr. This module reviews the key concepts from the chapter
"Algebraic Expressions and Equations."

Summary of Key Concepts

Numerical Expression ([link])
A numerical expression results when numbers are associated by arithmetic
opera­tion signs. The expressions 3 + 5, 9 - 2, 5  6 and 8 ÷ 5 are
numerical expressions.

Algebraic Expressions ([link])
When an arithmetic operation sign connects a letter with a number or a
letter with a letter, an algebraic expression results. The expressions 4x + 1
, x - 5, 7x  6y, and 4x ÷ 3 are algebraic expressions.

Terms and Factors ([link])
Terms are parts of sums and are therefore separated by addition (or
subtraction) signs. In the expression, 5x - 2y, 5x and -2y are the terms.
Factors are parts of products and are therefore separated by multiplication
signs. In the expression 5a, 5 and a are the factors.

Coefficients ([link])
The coefficient of a quantity records how many of that quantity there are.
In the expression 7x, the coefficient 7 indicates that there are seven x's.

Numerical Evaluation ([link])
Numerical evaluation is the process of determining the value of an
algebraic exp­ ression by replacing the variables in the expression with
specified values.

Combining Like Terms ([link])
An algebraic expression may be simplified by combining like terms. To
combine like terms, we simply add or subtract their coefficients then affix
the variable. For example 4x + 9x = (4 + 9)x = 13x.
Equation ([link])

An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal. The statements

                  4x  2
5x + 1 = 3 and + 4 = are equations. The expressions represent the

                   5  5

same quantities.

Conditional Equation ([link])
A conditional equation is an equation whose truth depends on the value
selected for the variable. The equation 3x = 9 is a conditional equation
since it is only true on the condition that 3 is selected for x.

Solutions and Solving an Equation ([link])
The values that when substituted for the variables make the equation true
are called the solutions of the equation.
An equation has been solved when all its solutions have been found.

Equivalent Equations ([link])
Equations that have precisely the same solutions are called equivalent
equations. The equations 6y = 18 and y = 3 are equivalent equations.

Addition/Subtraction Property of Equality ([link])
Given any equation, we can obtain an equivalent equation by

1. adding the same number to both sides, or
2. subtracting the same number from both sides.

Solving x + a = b and x - a = b ([link])
To solve x + a = b, subtract a from both sides.

x+a = b
x+a-a = b-a
x = b-a

To solve x - a = b, add a to both sides.
x-a = b
x-a+a = b+a
x = b+a

Multiplication/Division Property of Equality ([link])
Given any equation, we can obtain an equivalent equation by

1. multiplying both sides by the same nonzero number, that is, if c  0,
  a = b and a  c = b  c are equivalent.

2. dividing both sides by the same nonzero number, that is, if c  0,

                                 a  b
    a = b and = are equivalent.

                                 c  c

                                                  x

Solving ax = b and = b ([link])

                                                  a

To solve ax = b, a  0, divide both sides by a.

ax = b

ax                   b

a   =                a

ax                   b

a   =                a

                              b

   x=

                              a

                      x

To solve = b, a  0, multiply both sides by a.

                      a

                  x  =b
                  a  = ab
                  x  = ab

   a

                  a
                x

a

                a

    x = ab

Translating Words to Mathematics ([link])
In solving applied problems, it is important to be able to translate phrases
and sentences to mathematical expressions and equations.
The Five-Step Method for Solving Applied Problems ([link])
To solve problems algebraically, it is a good idea to use the following five-
step procedure.
After working your way through the problem carefully, phrase by phrase:

   1. Let x (or some other letter) represent the unknown quantity.
   2. Translate the phrases and sentences to mathematical symbols and form

      an equation. Draw a picture if possible.
   3. Solve this equation.
   4. Check the solution by substituting the result into the original statement

      of the problem.
   5. Write a conclusion.
