Features of the Text

Similar to the presentation of the single-variable Active Calculus, instructors
and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation,
including:

Motivating Questions. At the start of each section, we list motivating ques-
       tions that provide motivation for why the following material is of interest
       to us. One goal of each section is to answer each of the motivating ques-
       tions.

Preview Activities. Each section of the text begins with a short introduc-
       tion, followed by a preview activity. This brief reading and the preview
       activity are designed to foreshadow the upcoming ideas in the remainder
       of the section; both the reading and preview activity are intended to be
       accessible to students in advance of class, and indeed to be completed by
       students before a day on which a particular section is to be considered.

Activities. Every section in the text contains several activities. These are
       designed to engage students in an inquiry-based style that encourages
       them to construct solutions to key examples on their own, working either
       individually or in small groups.

Exercises. There are dozens of calculus texts with (collectively) tens of thou-
       sands of exercises. Rather than repeat a large list of standard and rou-
       tine exercises in this text, we recommend the use of WeBWorK with its
       access to the National Problem Library and its many multivariable cal-
       culus problems. In this text, each section begins with several anonymous
       WeBWorK exercises, and follows with several challenging problems. The
       WeBWorK exercises are best completed in the .htm version of the
       text. Almost every non-WeBWorK problem has multiple parts, requires
       the student to connect several key ideas, and expects that the student
       will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and
       explain their findings. For instructors interested in a more conventional
       source of exercises, consider the freely available APEX Ca cu us text by
       Greg Hartmann et al.

Graphics. As much as possible, we strive to demonstrate key fundamental
       ideas visually, and to encourage students to do the same. Throughout the
       text, we use full-color graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas, and
       to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic
       representations of calculus. When the text itself refers to color in images,
       one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically. The figures and the
       software to generate them have been created by David Austin.

Summary of Key Ideas. Each section concludes with a summary of the key
       ideas encountered in the preceding section; this summary normally re-
       flects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.

Links to technological tools. Many of the ideas of multivariable calculus
       are best understood dynamically, and we encourage readers to make
       frequent use of technology to analyze graphs and data. Since tech-
       nology changes so often, we refrain from indicating specific programs
       to use in the text. However, aside from computer algebra systems like
       Maple, Mathematics, or Sage, there are many free graphing tools avail-
       able for drawing three-dimensional surfaces or curves. These programs
       can be used by instructors and students to assist in the investigations and
       demonstrations. The use of these freely available applets is in accord with
       our philosophy that no one should be required to purchase materials to
       learn calculus. We are indebted to everyone who allows their expertise
       to be openly shared. Below is a list of a few of the technological tools
       that are available (links active at the writing of this edition). Of course,
       you can find your own by searching the web.

       calculations

   · Wo fram A pha widgets, searchable site for simple to use programs using
       Wolfram Alpha

   · GeoGebra, all purpose graphing tool with some computer algebra capabil-
       ities. Clicking on the magnifying glass icon allows you to search a large
       database of GeoGebra applets.

Active Calculus - Multivariable:

our goals

Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old. As a for-
mal subdiscipline of mathematics, calculus was first introduced and developed
in the late 1600s, with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton
and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Mathematicians agree that the subject has
been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl
Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was devel-
oped, in part to make sense of the infinitely small quantities on which calculus
rests. As a body of knowledge, calculus has been completely understood for at
least 150 years. The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achieve-
ments: among many spectacular ideas, calculus models how objects fall under
the forces of gravity and wind resistance, explains how to compute areas and
volumes of interesting shapes, enables us to work rigorously with infinitely
small and infinitely large quantities, and connects the varying rates at which
quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.

    While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers their own creative
perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas an
author presents are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees
on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their
importance; the core parts of nearly all calculus textbooks are very similar.
As such, it is our opinion that in the 21st century--an age where the internet
permits seamless and immediate transmission of information--no one should
be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a
coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not
any individual author or publishing company. Thus, a main purpose of this
work is to present a new multivariable calculus text that is free. In addition,
instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to
download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this
text is open-source.

    In Active Calculus - Multivariable, we endeavor to actively engage students
in learning the subject through an activity-driven approach in which the vast
majority of the examples are completed by students. Where many texts present
a general theory of calculus followed by substantial collections of worked ex-
amples, we instead pose problems or situations, consider possibilities, and then
ask students to investigate and explore. Following key activities or examples,
the presentation normally includes some overall perspective and a brief syn-
opsis of general trends or properties, followed by formal statements of rules or
theorems. While we often offer plausibility arguments for such results, rarely
do we include formal proofs. It is not the intent of this text for the instructor
or author to demonstrate to students that the ideas of calculus are coherent

                                                 viii
                                                                                                    ix

and true, but rather for students to encounter these ideas in a supportive,
leading manner that enables them to begin to understand for themselves why
calculus is both coherent and true.

    This approach is consistent with the following goals:

   · To have students engage in an active, inquiry-driven approach, where
       learners strive to construct solutions and approaches to ideas on their
       own, with appropriate support through questions posed, hints, and guid-
       ance from the instructor and text.

   · To build in students intuition for why the main ideas in multivariable
       calculus are natural and true. We strive to accomplish this by using spe-
       cific cases to highlight the ideas for the general situation using contexts
       that are common and familiar.

   · To challenge students to acquire deep, personal understanding of multi-
       variable calculus through reading the text and completing preview activ-
       ities on their own, through working on activities in small groups in class,
       and through doing substantial exercises outside of class time.

   · To strengthen students' written and oral communication skills by hav-
       ing them write about and explain aloud the key ideas of multivariable
       calculus.
How to Use this Text

Because the text is free, any professor or student may use the electronic version
of the text for no charge. For reading on laptops or mobile devices, the best
electronic version to use is the .htm version of the text, but you can find
links to a pdf and hard copy of the text at https://activeca cu us.org/.
Furthermore, because the text is open-source, any instructor may acquire the
full set of source files, which are available on GitHub.

    This text may be used as a stand-alone textbook for a standard multivari-
able calculus course or as a supplement to a more traditional text. Chapter 9
introduces functions of several independent variables along with tools that will
be used to study these functions, namely vectors and vector-valued functions.
Chapter 10 studies differentiation of functions of several independent variables
in detail, addressing the typical topics including limits, partial derivatives, and
optimization, while Chapter 11 provides the standard topics of integration of
multivariable functions.

Electronic Edition Because students and instructors alike have access to the
       book in electronic format, there are several advantages to the text over a
       traditional print text. One is that the text may be projected on a screen
       in the classroom (or even better, on a whiteboard) and the instructor may
       reference ideas in the text directly, add comments or notation or features
       to graphs, and indeed write right on the projected text itself. Students
       can do the same when working at the board. In addition, students can
       choose to print only whatever portions of the text are needed for them.
       Also, the electronic versions of the text includes live .html links to on-
       line programs, so student and instructor alike may follow those links to
       additional resources that lie outside the text itself. Finally, students can
       have access to a copy of the text anywhere they have a computer. The
       .html version is far superior to the .pdf version; this is especially true for
       viewing on a smartphone.

       Note. In the .pdf version, there is not an obvious visual indicator of the
       live .html links, so some availalable information is suppressed. If you are
       using the text electronically in a setting with internet access, please know
       that it is assumed you are using the .html version.

Activities Workbook Each section of the text has a preview activity and
       at least three in-class activities embedded in the discussion. As it is the
       expectation that students will complete all of these activities, it is ideal
       for them to have room to work on them adjacent to the problem state-
       ments themselves. A separate workbook of activities that includes only
       the individual activity prompts, along with space provided for students
       to write their responses, is in development.

Community of Users Because this text is free and open-source, we hope
       that as people use the text, they will contribute corrections, suggestions,
       and new material. At this time, the best way to communicate such
       feedback is by email to Steve Schlicker at sch icks@gvsu.edu.

Motivating Questions

   · What is a function of several variables? What do we mean by the domain
       of a function of several variables?

· How do we find the distance between two points in R3? What is the
   equation of a sphere in R3?

· What is a trace of a function of two variables? What does a trace tell us
   about a function?

   · What is a level curve of a function of two variables? What does a level
       curve tell us about a function?

    Throughout our mathematical careers we have studied functions of a single
variable. We define a function of one variable as a rule that assigns exactly one
output to each input. We analyze these functions by looking at their graphs,
calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. Functions of several
variables will be the main focus of Chapters 10 and 11, where we will analyze
these functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating,
integrating, and more. We will see that many of the ideas from single vari-
able calculus translate well to functions of several variables, but we will have
to make some adjustments as well. In this chapter we introduce functions
of several variables and then discuss some of the tools (vectors and vector-
valued functions) that will help us understand and analyze functions of several
variables.

Preview Activity 9.1.1 Suppose you invest money in an account that pays
5% interest compounded continuously. If you invest P dollars in the account,
the amount A of money in the account after t years is given by

                                           A = P e0.05t.

The variables P and t are independent of each other, so using functional

notation we write

                   A(P, t) = P e0.05t.

a. Find the amount of money in the account after 7 years if you originally
   invest 1000 dollars.

b. Evaluate A(5000, 8). Explain in words what this calculation represents.

c. Now consider only the situation where the amount invested is fixed at
   1000 dollars. Calculate the amount of money in the account after t years
   as indicated in Table 9.1.1. Round payments to the nearest penny.

d. Now consider the situation where we want to know the amount of money
    in the account after 10 years given various initial investments. Calculate
    the amount of money in the account as indicated in Table 9.1.2. Round
    payments to the nearest penny.

e. Describe as best you can the combinations of initial investments and time
   that result in an account containing $10,000.

9.1.1 Functions of Several Variables

Up to this point we have been concerned with functions of a single variable.
What defined such a function is that every input in the domain produced a
unique output in the range. We saw similar behavior in Preview Activity 9.1.1,
where each pair (P, t) of inputs produces a unique output A(P, t). Additionally,
the two variables P and t had no real relation to each other. That is, we could
choose any value of P without condsidering what value t might have, and we
could select any value of t to use without regard to what value P might have.
For that reason we say that the variables t and P are independent of each other.
Thus, we call A = A(P, t) a function of the two independent variables P and
t. This is the key idea in defining a function of two independent variables.

Definition 9.1.3 A function f of two independent variables is a rule

that assigns to each ordered pair (x, y) in some set D exactly one real number

f (x, y).                                                                  

There is, of course, no reason to restrict ourselves to functions of only two

variables--we can use any number of variables we like. For example,

                          f (x, y, z) = x2 - 2xz + cos(y)

defines f as a function of the three variables x, y, and z. In general, a func-
tion of n independent variables is a rule that assigns to an ordered n-tuple
(x1, x2, . . . , xn) in some set D exactly one real number.

    As with functions of a single variable, it is important to understand the set
of inputs for which the function is defined.

Definition 9.1.4 The domain of a function f is the set of all inputs at which

the function is defined.                                                   
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                3

Activity 9.1.2 Identify the domain of each of the following functions. Draw
a picture of each domain in the xy-plane.

   a. f (x, y) = x2 + y2

   b. f (x, y) = x2 + y2
   c. Q(x, y) = x2-y2 x+y
   d. s(x, y) =  1 1-xy2

9.1.2 Representing Functions of Two Variables

One of the techniques we use to study functions of one variable is to create
a table of values. We can do the same for functions of two variables, except
that our tables will have to allow us to keep track of both input variables. We
can do this with a 2-dimensional table, where we list the x-values down the
first column and the y-values across the first row. As an example, suppose we
launch a projectile, using a golf club, a cannon, or some other device, from
ground level. Under ideal conditions (ignoring wind resistance, spin, or any
other forces except the force of gravity) the horizontal distance the object will
travel depends on the initial velocity x the object is given, and the angle y at
which it is launched. If we let f represent the horizontal distance the object
travels, then f is a function of the two variables x and y, and we represent f
in functional notation by

                  f (x, y) =  x2 sin(2y)  ,

                              g

where g is the acceleration due to gravity. (Note that g is constant, 32 feet per
second squared. We will derive this equation in a later section.) To create a
table of values for f , we list the x-values down the first column and the y-values
across the first row. The value f (x, y) is then displayed in the location where
the x row intersects the y column, as shown in Table 9.1.5 (where we measure
x in feet per second and y in radians).

                                                                 x2 sin(2y)

Activity 9.1.3 Complete Table 9.1.5 by filling in the missing values of the
function f . Round entries to the nearest tenth.

    If f is a function of a single variable x, then we define the graph of f to be
the set of points of the form (x, f (x)), where x is in the domain of f . We then
plot these points using the coordinate axes in order to visualize the graph. We
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                                 4

can do a similar thing with functions of several variables. Table 9.1.5 identifies
points of the form (x, y, f (x, y)), and we define the graph of f to be the set of
these points.

Definition 9.1.6 The graph of a function f = f (x, y) is the set of points of

the form (x, y, f (x, y)), where the point (x, y) is in the domain of f .     

   We also often refer to the graph of a function f of two variables as the sur-

face generated by f . Points in the form (x, y, f (x, y)) are in three dimensions,

so plotting these points takes a bit more work than graphs of functions in two

dimensions. To plot these three-dimensional points, we need to set up a coor-

dinate system with three mutually perpendicular axes -- the x-axis, the y-axis,

and the z-axis (called the coordinate axes). There are essentially two different

ways we could set up a 3D coordinate system, as shown in Figure 9.1.7; thus,

before we can proceed, we need to establish a convention.

y        x

Figure 9.1.7 Left: A left hand system. Right: A right hand system

    The distinction between these two figures is subtle, but important. In
the coordinate system shown at left in Figure 9.1.7, imagine that you are
sitting on the positive z-axis next to the label "z." Looking down at the x-
and y-axes, you see that the y-axis is obtained by rotating the x-axis by 90
in the counterclockwise direction. Again sitting on the positive z-axis in the
coordinate system at right in Figure 9.1.7, you see that the y-axis is obtained
by rotating the x-axis by 90 in the clockwise direction.

    We call the coordinate system at right in Figure 9.1.7 a right-hand system;
if we point the index finger of our right hand along the positive x-axis and our
middle finger along the positive y-axis, then our thumb points in the direction
of the positive z-axis. Following mathematical conventions, we choose to use
a right-hand system throughout this book.

    Now that we have established a convention for a right-hand system, we can

                                                                                                              x2 sin(2y)

draw a graph of the distance function defined by f (x, y) = g . Note that
the function f is continuous in both variables, so when we plot these points in
the right hand coordinate system, we can connect them all to form a surface
in 3-space. The graph of the distance function f is shown in Figure 9.1.8.

Figure 9.1.8 The distance surface.

    There are many graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional sur-
faces as indicated in the Preface (see Links to interactive graphics in Features
of the Text). Since we will be able to visualize graphs of functions of two
independent variables, but not functions of more than two variables, we will
primarily deal with functions of two variables in this text. It is important
to note, however, that the techniques we develop apply to functions of any
number of variables.

    Notation: We let R2 denote the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers in
the plane (two copies of the real number system) and let R3 represent the set
of all ordered triples of real numbers (which constitutes three-space).

9.1.3 Some Standard Equations in Three-Space

In addition to graphing functions, we will also want to understand graphs of
some simple equations in three dimensions. For example, in R2, the graphs of
the equations x = a and y = b, where a and b are constants, are lines parallel to
the coordinate axes. In the next activity we consider their three-dimensional
analogs.

Activity 9.1.4

   a. Consider the set of points (x, y, z) that satisfy the equation x = 2. De-
       scribe this set as best you can.

   b. Consider the set of points (x, y, z) that satisfy the equation y = -1.
       Describe this set as best you can.

   c. Consider the set of points (x, y, z) that satisfy the equation z = 0. De-
       scribe this set as best you can.

    Activity 9.1.4 shows that the equations where one independent variable is
constant lead to planes parallel to ones that result from a pair of the coordinate
axes. When we make the constant 0, we get the coordinate planes. The xy-
plane satisfies z = 0, the xz-plane satisfies y = 0, and the yz-plane satisfies
x = 0 (see Figure 9.1.9).

Figure 9.1.9 The coordinate planes.

    On a related note, we define a circle in R2 as the set of all points equidistant
from a fixed point. In R3, we call the set of all points equidistant from a fixed
point a sphere. To find the equation of a sphere, we need to understand how to
calculate the distance between two points in three-space, and we explore this
idea in the next activity.

Activity 9.1.5                                                Q = (x1, y1, z1)
Let P = (x0, y0, z0) and Q =                                               R
(x1, y1, z1) be two points in R3.
These two points form opposite ver-

tices of a rectangular box whose sides

are planes parallel to the coordinate

planes as illustrated in Figure 9.1.10,

and the distance between P and Q is

the length of the blue diagonal shown

in Figure 9.1.10.

                                         P = (x0, y0, z0)     S

                                            Figure 9.1.10 The distance formula in
                                            R3.

a. Consider the right triangle P RS in the base of the box whose hypotenuse
   is shown as the red line in Figure 9.1.10. What are the coordinates of
   the vertices of this triangle? Since this right triangle lies in a plane, we
   can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find a formula for the length of the
   hypotenuse of this triangle. Find such a formula, which will be in terms
   of x0, y0, x1, and y1.

b. Now notice that the triangle P RQ whose hypotenuse is the blue segment

connecting the points P and Q with a leg as the hypotenuse P R of the

triangle found in part (a) lies entirely in a plane, so we can again use the

Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of its hypotenuse. Explain why

the length of this hypotenuse, which is the distance between the points

P and Q, is

                (x1 - x0)2 + (y1 - y0)2 + (z1 - z0)2.

The formula developed in Activity 9.1.5 is important to remember.

             The distance between points.

The distance between points P = (x0, y0, z0) and Q = (x1, y1, z1) (de-
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                      7

noted as |P Q|) in R3 is given by the formula             (9.1.1)
           |P Q| = (x1 - x0)2 + (y1 - y0)2 + (z1 - z0)2.

    Equation (9.1.1) can be used to derive the formula for a sphere centered at
a point (x0, y0, z0) with radius r. Since the distance from any point (x, y, z)
on such a sphere to the point (x0, y0, z0) is r, the point (x, y, z) will satisfy the
equation

                            (x - x0)2 + (y - y0)2 + (z - z0)2 = r
    Squaring both sides, we come to the standard equation for a sphere.

                                The equation of a sphere.

    The equation of a sphere with center (x0, y0, z0) and radius r is

                          (x - x0)2 + (y - y0)2 + (z - z0)2 = r2.

    This makes sense if we compare this equation to its two-dimensional ana-
logue, the equation of a circle of radius r in the plane centered at (x0, y0):

                                 (x - x0)2 + (y - y0)2 = r2.

9.1.4 Traces

When we study functions of several variables we are often interested in how
each individual variable affects the function in and of itself. In Preview Ac-
tivity 9.1.1, we saw that the amount of money in an account depends on the
interest rate and the duration of the investment. However, if we fix the interest
rate, the amount of money in the account depends only on the duration of the
investment, and if we set the duration of the investment constant, then the
amount of money in the account depends only on the interest rate. This idea
of keeping one variable constant while we allow the other to change will be an
important tool for us when studying functions of several variables.

    As another example, consider again the distance function f defined by

                                                   x2 sin(2y)
                                      f (x, y) =

                                                         g

where x is the initial velocity of an object in feet per second, y is the launch
angle in radians, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (32 feet per second
squared). If we hold the launch angle constant at y = 0.6 radians, we can
consider f a function of the initial velocity alone. In this case we have

                                               x2
                                     f (x) = sin(2 · 0.6).

                                               32

    We can plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the
surface when y = 0.6, as shown at left in Figure 9.1.11. The formula clearly
shows that f is quadratic in the x-direction. More descriptively, as we increase
the launch velocity while keeping the launch angle constant, the horizontal
distance the object travels increases proportional to the square of the initial
velocity.
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                                                 8

    Similarly, if we fix the initial velocity at 150 feet per second, we can consider
the distance as a function of the launch angle only. In this case we have

                     f (y) =                   1502 sin(2y)  .

                                               32

    We can again plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on
the surface when x = 150, as shown at right in Figure 9.1.11. The formula
clearly show that f is sinusoidal in the y-direction. More descriptively, as
we increase the launch angle while keeping the initial velocity constant, the
horizontal distance traveled by the object is proportional to the sine of twice
the launch angle.

Figure 9.1.11 Left: The trace with y = 0.6. Right: The trace with x = 150.

    The curves we define when we fix one of the independent variables in our
two variable function are called traces.

Definition 9.1.12 A trace of a function f of two independent variables x and

y in the x direction is a curve of the form z = f (x, c), where c is a constant.

Similarly, a trace of a function f of two independent variables x and y in the

y direction is a curve of the form z = f (c, y), where c is a constant.                       

Understanding trends in the behavior of functions of two variables can be

challenging, as can sketching their graphs; traces help us with each of these

tasks.

Activity 9.1.6 In the following questions, we investigate the use of traces to
better understand a function through both tables and graphs.

a. Identify the y = 0.6 trace for the distance function f defined by f (x, y) =

      x2 sin(2y)

        g by highlighting or circling the appropriate cells in Table 9.1.5.
   Write a sentence to describe the behavior of the function along this trace.

b. Identify the x = 150 trace for the distance function by highlighting or
    circling the appropriate cells in Table 9.1.5. Write a sentence to describe
    the behavior of the function along this trace.

9.1.5 Contour Maps and Level Curves

We have all seen topographic maps such as the one of the Porcupine Mountains
in the upper peninsula of Michigan shown in Figure 9.1.14.1 The curves on
these maps show the regions of constant altitude. The contours also depict
changes in altitude: contours that are close together signify steep ascents or
descents, while contours that are far apart indicate only slight changes in el-
evation. Thus, contour maps tell us a lot about three-dimensional surfaces.
Mathematically, if f (x, y) represents the altitude at the point (x, y), then each
contour is the graph of an equation of the form f (x, y) = k, for some constant
k.

Figure 9.1.14 Contour map of the Porcupine Mountains.

Activity 9.1.7 On the topographical map of the Porcupine Mountains in
Figure 9.1.14,

   a. identify the highest and lowest points you can find;

b. from a point of your choice, determine a path of steepest ascent that
    leads to the highest point;

   c. from that same initial point, determine the least steep path that leads to
       the highest point.

    Curves on a surface that describe points at the same height or level are
called level curves.

Definition 9.1.15 A level curve (or contour) of a function f of two in-

dependent variables x and y is a curve of the form k = f (x, y), where k is a

constant.                                              

Topographical maps can be used to create a three-dimensional surface from

the two-dimensional contours or level curves. For example, level curves of the

                                                                             x2 sin(2y)

distance function defined by f (x, y) = 32 plotted in the xy-plane are
shown at left in Figure 9.1.16. If we lift these contours and plot them at their

respective heights, then we get a picture of the surface itself, as illustrated at

right in Figure 9.1.16.

    The traces and level curves of a function of two variables are curves in space.
In order to understand these traces and level curves better, we will first spend
some time learning about vectors and vector-valued functions in the next few
sections and return to our study of functions of several variables once we have
those more mathematical tools to support their study.

9.1.7 Summary

    · A function f of several variables is a rule that assigns a unique number to
       an ordered collection of independent inputs. The domain of a function of
       several variables is the set of all inputs for which the function is defined.

    · In R3, the distance between points P = (x0, y0, z0) and Q = (x1, y1, z1)
       (denoted as |P Q|) is given by the formula

                        |P Q| = (x1 - x0)2 + (y1 - y0)2 + (z1 - z0)2.

       and thus the equation of a sphere with center (x0, y0, z0) and radius r is

                              (x - x0)2 + (y - y0)2 + (z - z0)2 = r2.

    · A trace of a function f of two independent variables x and y is a curve
       of the form z = f (c, y) or z = f (x, c), where c is a constant. A trace tells
       us how the function depends on a single independent variable if we treat
       the other independent variable as a constant.

    · A level curve of a function f of two independent variables x and y is
       a curve of the form k = f (x, y), where k is a constant. A level curve
       describes the set of inputs that lead to a specific output of the function.

15. The Ideal Gas Law, P V = RT , relates the pressure (P , in pascals), tem-

perature (T , in Kelvin), and volume (V , in cubic meters) of 1 mole of a

                mol

behavior of gases that do not liquefy easily, such as oxygen and hydrogen.

We can solve the ideal gas law for the volume and hence treat the volume

as a function of the pressure and temperature:

                             V (P, T ) =  8.314T  .

16. When people buy a large ticket item like a car or a house, they often
      take out a loan to make the purchase. The loan is paid back in monthly
      installments until the entire amount of the loan, plus interest, is paid. The
      monthly payment that the borrower has to make depends on the amount
      P of money borrowed (called the principal), the duration t of the loan in
      years, and the interest rate r. For example, if we borrow $18,000 to buy
      a car, the monthly payment M that we need to make to pay off the loan
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS       19

is given by the formula

                         M (r, t) =       1500r
                                      1-  1.

          a. Find the monthly payments on this loan if the interest rate is 6%
              and the duration of the loan is 5 years.

          b. Create a table of values that illustrates the trace of M with r fixed
              at 5%. Use yearly values of t from 2 to 6. Round payments to the
              nearest penny. Explain in detail in words what this trace tells us
              about M .

          c. Create a table of values that illustrates the trace of M with t fixed
              at 3 years. Use rates from 3% to 11% in increments of 2%. Round
              payments to the nearest penny. Explain in detail what this trace
              tells us about M .

          d. Consider the combinations of interest rates and durations of loans
              that result in a monthly payment of $200. Solve the equation
              M (r, t) = 200 for t to write the duration of the loan in terms of
              the interest rate. Graph this level curve and explain as best you can
              the relationship between t and r.

17. Consider the function h defined by h(x, y) = 8 - 4 - x2 - y2.

          b. The range of a function is the set of all outputs the function gen-
              erates. Given that the range of the square root function g(t) = t
              is the set of all nonnegative real numbers, what do you think is the
              range of h? Why?

          c. Choose 4 different values from the range of h and plot the corre-
              sponding level curves in the plane. What is the shape of a typical
              level curve?

          d. Choose 5 different values of x (including at least one negative value
              and zero), and sketch the corresponding traces of the function h.

              and zero), and sketch the corresponding traces of the function h.

              least one sentence to describe how the surface appears visually. Does
              the surface remind you of a familiar physical structure in nature?

9.2 Vectors

Motivating Questions

   · What is a vector?
   · What does it mean for two vectors to be equal?
   · How do we add two vectors together and multiply a vector by a scalar?
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS  20

   · How do we determine the magnitude of a vector? What is a unit vector,
       and how do we find a unit vector in the direction of a given vector?

    Quantities like length, speed, area, and mass are all measured by numbers
(called scalars). Other quantities, like velocity, force, and displacement, have
two attributes: magnitude and direction. These quantities are represented by
vectors and are the study of this section. For example, we will use vectors to
calculate work done by a constant force, calculate torque, determine direction
vectors for lines and normal vectors for planes, define curvature, and determine
the direction of greatest increase on a surface. For most of these applications,
we will interested in using vectors to measure direction and/or speed. Vectors
will be a major tool for us in determining the behavior of functions of several
variables.

    If we are at a point x in the domain of a function of one variable, there
are only two directions in which we can move: in the positive or negative x-
direction. If, however, we are at a point (x, y) in the domain of a function
of two variables, there are many directions in which we can move. Thus, it
is important for us to have a means to indicate direction, and we will do so
using vectors. This notion of direction in space will be critical for us to find
direction vectors for lines, tangent lines to curves, normal vectors to planes,
and to determine direction of motion.

Preview Activity 9.2.1 Postscript is a programming language whose primary
purpose is to describe the appearance of text or graphics. A simple set of
Postscript commands that produces the triangle in the plane with vertices
(0, 0), (1, 1), and (1, -1) is the following:

                                            (0,0) moveto
                                            (1,1) ineto stroke
                                            (1,-1) ineto stroke
                                            (0,0) ineto stroke

The key idea in these commands is that we start at the origin, then tell
Postscript that we want to start at the point (0, 0), draw a line from the
point (0, 0) to the point (1, 1) (this is what the lineto and stroke commands
do), then draw lines from (1, 1) to (1, -1) and (1, -1) back to the origin. Each
of these commands encodes two important pieces of information: a direction
in which to move and a distance to move. Mathematically, we can capture this
information succinctly in a vector. To do so, we record the movement on the
map in a pair x, y (this pair x, y is a vector), where x is the horizontal
displacement and y the vertical displacement from one point to another. So,
for example, the vector from the origin to the point (1, 1) is represented by the
vector 1, 1 .

a. What is the vector v1 = x, y that describes the displacement from the
   point (1, 1) to the point (1, -1)? How can we use this vector to determine
   the distance from the point (1, 1) to the point (1, -1)?

b. Suppose we want to draw the triangle with vertices A = (2, 3), B =
    (-3, 1), and C = (4, -2). As a shorthand notation, we will denote the
                                                            --

i. Determine the vectors AB, BC, and AC.

ii. What relationship do you see among the vectors AB, BC, and AC?

Explain why this relationship should hold.

9.2.1 Representations of Vectors

Preview Activity 9.2.1 shows how we can record the magnitude and direction
of a change in position using an ordered pair of numbers x, y . There are
many other quantities, such as force and velocity, that possess the attributes
of magnitude and direction, and we will call each such quantity a vector.

Definition 9.2.1 A vector is a quantity that possesses the attributes of mag-

nitude and direction.                          

We can represent a vector geometrically as a directed line segment, with the

magnitude as the length of the segment and an arrowhead indicating direction,

as shown at left in Figure 9.2.2.

Figure 9.2.2 Left: A vector. Right: Representations of the same vector.

    According to the definition, a vector possesses the attributes of length (mag-
nitude) and direction; the vector's position, however, is not mentioned. Con-
sequently, we regard as equal any two vectors having the same magnitude and
direction, as shown at right in Figure 9.2.2. In other words, two vectors are
equal provided they have the same magnitude and direction.

    This means that the same vector may be drawn in the plane in many
different ways. For instance, suppose that we would like to draw the vector
 3, 4 , which represents a horizontal change of three units and a vertical change
of four units. We may place the tail of the vector (the point from which the
vector originates) at the origin and the tip (the terminal point of the vector) at
(3, 4), as illustrated at left in Figure 9.2.3. A vector with its tail at the origin
is said to be in standard position.

    Alternatively, we may place the tail of the vector 3, 4 at another point,
such as Q(1, 1). After a displacement of three units to the right and four units
up, the tip of the vector is at the point R(4, 5) (see the vector at right in
Figure 9.2.3).

    In this example, the vector led to the directed line segment from Q to R,
                         --

which we denote as QR. We may also turn the situation around: given the two
points Q and R, we obtain the vector 3, 4 because we move horizontally three

                                                                                      --
units and vertically four units to get from Q to R. In other words, QR = 3, 4 .

                             --
In general, the vector QR from the point Q = (q1, q2) to R = (r1, r2) is found
by taking the difference of coordinates, so that

                            --
                            QR = r1 - q1, r2 - q2 .

We will use boldface letters to represent vectors, such as v = 3, 4 , to

distinguish them from scalars. The entries of a vector are called its components;

in the vector 3, 4 , the x component is 3 and the y component is 4. We use

pointed brackets , and the term components to distinguish a vector from a

point ( , ) and its coordinates. There is, however, a close connection between

vectors and points. Given a point P , we will frequently consider the vector
--                                                      --
OP from the origin O to P . For instance, if P = (3, 4), then OP = 3, 4 as
                                                                        --
in Figure 9.2.4. In this way, we think of a point P as defining a vector OP
                                                        --
whose components agree with the coordinates of P . The vector OP is called

the position vector of P .

Figure 9.2.4 A point defines a vector
    While we often illustrate vectors in the plane since it is easier to draw

pictures, different situations call for the use of vectors in three or more dimen-
sions. For instance, a vector v in n-dimensional space, Rn, has n components
and may be represented as

                                    v = v1, v2, v3, . . . , vn .

    The next activity will help us to become accustomed to vectors and oper-
ations on vectors in three dimensions.
Activity 9.2.2 An article by C.Kenneth Tanner of the University of Georgia
argues that, due to the concept of social distance, a secondary school classroom
for 20 students should have 1344 square feet of floor space. Suppose a classroom
is 32 feet by 42 feet by 8 feet. Set the origin O of the classroom to be its center.
In this classroom, a student is sitting on a chair whose seat is at location
A = (9, -6, -1.5), an overhead projector is located at position B = (0, 1, 7),
and the teacher is standing at point C = (-2, 20, -4), all distances measured
in feet. Determine the components of the indicated vectors and explain in
context what each represents.

9.2.2 Equality of Vectors

Because location is not mentioned in the definition of a vector, any two vectors
that have the same magnitude and direction are equal. It is helpful to have
an algebraic way to determine when this occurs. That is, if we know the
components of two vectors u and v, we will want to be able to determine
algebraically when u and v are equal. There is an obvious set of conditions
that we use.

                                    Equality of Vectors.

    Two vectors u = u1, u2 and v = v1, v2 in R2 are equal if and only if
    their corresponding components are equal: u1 = v1 and u2 = v2. More
    generally, two vectors u = u1, u2, . . . , un and v = v1, v2, . . . , vn in
    Rn are equal if and only if ui = vi for each possible value of i.
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                24

9.2.3 Operations on Vectors

Vectors are not numbers, but we can now represent them with components
that are real numbers. As such, we naturally wonder if it is possible to add
two vectors together, multiply two vectors, or combine vectors in any other
ways. In this section, we will study two operations on vectors: vector addition
and scalar multiplication. To begin, we investigate a natural way to add two
vectors together, as well as to multiply a vector by a scalar.

Activity 9.2.3 Let u = 2, 3 , v = -1, 4 .

   a. Using the two specific vectors above, what is the natural way to define
       the vector sum u + v?

b. In general, how do you think the vector sum a + b of vectors a = a1, a2
    and b = b1, b2 in R2 should be defined? Write a formal definition of a
    vector sum based on your intuition.

c. In general, how do you think the vector sum a + b of vectors a =

    a1, a2, a3 and b = b1, b2, b3 in R3 should be defined? Write a for-
   mal definition of a vector sum based on your intuition.

   d. Returning to the specific vector v = -1, 4 given above, what is the
       natural way to define the scalar multiple 12 v?

   e. In general, how do you think a scalar multiple of a vector a = a1, a2 in
       R2 by a scalar c should be defined? how about for a scalar multiple of a
       vector a = a1, a2, a3 in R3 by a scalar c? Write a formal definition of a
       scalar multiple of a vector based on your intuition.

    We can now add vectors and multiply vectors by scalars, and thus we
can add together scalar multiples of vectors. This allows us to define vector
subtraction, v - u, as the sum of v and -1 times u, so that

                  v - u = v + (-1)u.

    Using vector addition and scalar multiplication, we will often represent
vectors in terms of the special vectors i = 1, 0 and j = 0, 1 . For instance,
we can write the vector a, b in R2 as

                              a, b = a 1, 0 + b 0, 1 = ai + bj,

which means that

                  2, -3 = 2i - 3j.

    In the context of R3, we let i = 1, 0, 0 , j = 0, 1, 0 , and k = 0, 0, 1 , and
we can write the vector a, b, c in R3 as

a, b, c = a 1, 0, 0 + b 0, 1, 0 + c 0, 0, 1 = ai + bj + ck.

    The vectors i, j, and k are called the standard unit vectors (as we will learn
momentarily, unit vectors have length 1), and are important in the physical
sciences.

9.2.4 Properties of Vector Operations

We know that the scalar sum 1 + 2 is equal to the scalar sum 2 + 1. This
is called the commutative property of scalar addition. Any time we define
operations on objects (like addition of vectors) we usually want to know what
kinds of properties the operations have. For example, is addition of vectors a
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS  25

commutative operation? To answer this question we take two arbitrary vectors
v and u and add them together and see what happens. Let v = v1, v2 and
u = u1, u2 . Now we use the fact that v1, v2, u1, and u2 are scalars, and that
the addition of scalars is commutative to see that

                                  v + u = v1, v2 + u1, u2
                                          = v1 + u1, v2 + u2
                                          = u1 + v1, u2 + v2
                                          = u1, u2 + v1, v2
                                          = u + v.

    So the vector sum is a commutative operation. Similar arguments can be
used to show the following properties of vector addition and scalar multiplica-
tion.

                           Properties of vector operations.

    Let v, u, and w be vectors in Rn and let a and b be scalars. Then
        1. v + u = u + v

        2. (v + u) + w = v + (u + w)

        3. The vector 0 = 0, 0, . . . , 0 has the property that v + 0 = v. The
            vector 0 is called the zero vector.

        4. (-1)v + v = 0. The vector (-1)v = -v is called the additive
            inverse of the vector v.

        5. (a + b)v = av + bv

        6. a(v + u) = av + au

        7. (ab)v = a(bv)

        8. 1v = v.

    We verified the first property for vectors in R2; it is straightforward to
verify that the rest of the eight properties just noted hold for all vectors in
Rn.

9.2.5 Geometric Interpretation of Vector Operations

Next, we explore a geometric interpretation of vector addition and scalar mul-
tiplication that allows us to visualize these operations. Let u = 4, 6 and
v = 3, -2 . Then w = u + v = 7, 4 , as shown on the left in Figure 9.2.5.
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS  26

 u                    v   u
    u+v  u                   u+v

v           u+v          v

Figure 9.2.5 A vector sum (left), summing displacements (center), the paral-
lelogram law (right).

    If we think of these vectors as displacements in the plane, we find a ge-
ometric way to envision vector addition. For instance, the vector u + v will
represent the displacement obtained by following the displacement u with the
displacement v. We may picture this by placing the tail of v at the tip of u,
as seen in the center of Figure 9.2.5.

    Of course, vector addition is commutative so we obtain the same sum if
we place the tail of u at the tip of v. We therefore see that u + v appears as
the diagonal of the parallelogram determined by u and v, as shown at right in
Figure 9.2.5.

    Vector subtraction has a similar interpretation. At left in Figure 9.2.6
we see vectors u, v, and w = u + v. If we rewrite v = w - u, we have
the arrangement shown at right in Figure 9.2.6. In other words, to form the
difference w - u, we draw a vector from the tip of u to the tip of w.

             v                        w-u
u                        u

       w = u+v                  w

Figure 9.2.6 Left: Vector addition. Right: Vector subtraction.

    In a similar way, we may geometrically represent a scalar multiple of a
vector. For instance, if v = 2, 3 , then 2v = 4, 6 . As shown in Figure 9.2.7,
multiplying v by 2 leaves the direction unchanged, but stretches v by 2. Also,
-2v = -4, -6 , which shows that multiplying by a negative scalar gives a
vector pointing in the opposite direction of v.

9.2.6 The Magnitude of a Vector

By definition, vectors have both direction and magnitude (or length). We now
investigate how to calculate the magnitude of a vector. Since a vector v can
be represented by a directed line segment, we can use the distance formula to
calculate the length of the segment. This length is the magnitude of the vector
v and is denoted |v|.

9.2.7 Summary

   · A vector is an object that possesses the attributes of magnitude and di-
       rection. Examples of vector quantities are position, velocity, acceleration,
       and force.

   · Two vectors are equal if they have the same direction and magnitude.
       Notice that position is not considered, so a vector is independent of its
       location.

   · If u = u1, u2, . . . , un and v = v1, v2, . . . , vn are two vectors in Rn,
       then their vector sum is the vector

                     u + v = u1 + v1, u2 + v2, . . . , un + vn .

If u = u1, u2, . . . , un is a vector in Rn and c is a scalar, then the scalar
multiple cu is the vector

                               cu = cu1, cu2, . . . , cun .

· The magnitude of the vector v = v1, v2, . . . , vn in Rn is the scalar

                            |v| =    v2   +  v2   +  ·  ·  ·  +  vn2 .

                                       1       2

A vector u is a unit vector provided that |u| = 1. If v is a nonzero vector,

then  the  vector   v   is  a  unit  vector  with    the      same      direction  as  v.
                   |v|

          c. Determine the components and draw geometric representations of
              the vectors u - v, u - 2v, and u - 3v on the same set of axes.

          d. Recall that u - v = u + (-1)v. Sketch the vectors u, v, u + v, and
              u - v on the same set of axes. Use the "tip to tail" perspective for
              vector addition to explain the geometric relationship between u, v,
              and u - v.

15. Recall that given any vector v, we can calculate its length, |v|. Also, we
      say that two vectors that are scalar multiples of one another are parallel.
          a. Let v = 3, 4 in R2. Compute |v|, and determine the components

CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                32

does its direction compare to v?

d. Let v be an arbitrary nonzero vector in R3. Write a general formula
    for a unit vector that is parallel to v.

      A force (like gravity) has both a magni-
      tude and a direction. If two forces u and    60 45
      v are applied to an object at the same
      point, the resultant force on the object is     O
      the vector sum of the two forces. When
      a force is applied by a rope or a cable,
      we call that force tension. Vectors can
      be used to determine tension.

                                                               w

                                                    an object.

    As an example, suppose a painting weighing 50 pounds is to be hung
from wires attached to the frame as illustrated in Figure 9.2.10. We need
to know how much tension will be on the wires to know what kind of wire
to use to hang the picture. Assume the wires are attached to the frame
at point O. Let u be the vector emanating from point O to the left and
v the vector emanating from point O to the right. Assume u makes a 60
angle with the horizontal at point O and v makes a 45 angle with the
horizontal at point O. Our goal is to determine the vectors u and v in
order to calculate their magnitudes.

   a. Treat point O as the origin. Use trigonometry to find the compo-
       nents u1 and u2 so that u = u1i + u2j. Since we don't know the
       magnitude of u, your components will be in terms of |u| and the
       cosine and sine of some angle. Then find the components v1 and v2
       so that v = v1i + v2j. Again, your components will be in terms of
       |v| and the cosine and sine of some angle.

   b. The total force holding the picture up is given by u + v. The force
       acting to pull the picture down is given by the weight of the picture.
       Find the force vector w acting to pull the picture down.

   c. The picture will hang in equilibrium when the force acting to hold
       it up is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force
       acting to pull it down. Equate these forces to find the components
       of the vectors u and v.

       mation does it tell us?

   · How can we tell if two vectors in Rn are perpendicular?

    In the last section, we considered vector addition and scalar multiplication
and found that each operation had a natural geometric interpretation. In this

9.3.1 The Dot Product

The definition of the dot product for vectors in R2 given in Preview Activ-
ity 9.3.1 can be extended to vectors in Rn.
Definition 9.3.4 The dot product of vectors u = u1, u2, . . . , un and v =
 v1, v2, . . . , vn in Rn is the scalar

                             u · v = u1v1 + u2v2 + . . . + unvn.

                                                                                                     
    (As we will see shortly, the dot product arises in physics to calculate the
work done by a vector force in a given direction. It might be more natural
to define the dot product in this context, but it is more convenient from a
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS       35

mathematical perspective to define the dot product algebraically and then
view work as an application of this definition.)

    For instance, we find that

           3, 0, 1 · -2, 1, 4 = 3 · (-2) + 0 · 1 + 1 · 4 = -6 + 0 + 4 = -2.

    Notice that the resulting quantity is a scalar. Our work in Preview Activ-
ity 9.3.1 examined dot products of two-dimensional vectors.
Activity 9.3.2 Determine each of the following.

   a. 1, 2, -3 · 4, -2, 0 .

   b. 0, 3, -2, 1 · 5, -6, 0, 4
    The dot product is a natural way to define a product of two vectors. In ad-
dition, it behaves in ways that are similar to the product of, say, real numbers.

                            Properties of the dot product.

    Let u, v, and w be vectors in Rn. Then
        1. u · v = v · u (the dot product is commutative), and

        2. (u + v) · w = (u · w) + (v · w).

        3. if c is a scalar, then (cu) · w = c(u · w).

    Moreover, the dot product gives us valuable geometric information about
the vectors and their relative orientation. For instance, let's consider what
happens when we dot a vector with itself:

      u · u = u1, u2, . . . , un · u1, u2, . . . , un = u12 + u22 + . . . + un2 = |u|2.

    In other words, the dot product of a vector with itself gives the square of
the length of the vector: u · u = |u|2.

9.3.2 The angle between vectors

The dot product can help us understand the angle between two vectors. For
instance, if we are given two vectors u and v, there are two angles that these
vectors create, as depicted at left in Figure 9.3.5. We will call , the smaller
of these angles, the angle between these vectors. Notice that  lies between 0
and .

      v  u                                     u-v

2 -   u  
                   v

Figure 9.3.5 Left: The angle between u and v. Right: The triangle formed
by u, v, and u - v.
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS       36

    To determine this angle, we may apply the Law of Cosines to the triangle
shown at right in Figure 9.3.5.

    Using the fact that the dot product of a vector with itself gives us the
square of its length, together with the properties of the dot product, we find:

                                    |u - v|2 = |u|2 + |v|2 - 2|u||v| cos()
                         (u - v) · (u - v) = u · u + v · v - 2|u||v| cos()
               u · (u - v) - v · (u - v) = u · u + v · v - 2|u||v| cos()
                    u · u - 2u · v + v · v = u · u + v · v - 2|u||v| cos()

                                     -2u · v = - 2|u||v| cos()
                                         u · v = |u||v| cos().

To summarize, we have the important relationship

u · v = u1v1 + u2v2 + . . . + unvn = |u||v| cos().  (9.3.1)

    It is sometimes useful to think of Equation (9.3.1) as giving us an expression
for the angle between two vectors:

 = cos-1 u · v .
               |u||v|

    The real beauty of this expression is this: the dot product is a very simple
algebraic operation to perform yet it provides us with important geometric
information -- namely the angle between the vectors -- that would be difficult
to determine otherwise.

Activity 9.3.3 Determine each of the following.

   a. The length of the vector u = 1, 2, -3 using the dot product.

b. The angle between the vectors u = 1, 2 and v = 4, -1 to the nearest
    tenth of a degree.

c. The angle between the vectors y = 1, 2, -3 and z = -2, 1, 1 to the
   nearest tenth of a degree.

d. If the angle between the vectors u and v is a right angle, what does the
    expression u · v = |u||v| cos() say about their dot product?

e. If the angle between the vectors u and v is acute--that is, less than
   /2--what does the expression u · v = |u||v| cos() say about their dot
   product?

f. If the angle between the vectors u and v is obtuse--that is, greater than
   /2--what does the expression u · v = |u||v| cos() say about their dot
   product?

9.3.3 The Dot Product and Orthogonality

When the angle between two vectors is a right angle, it is frequently the case
that something important is happening. In this case, we say the vectors are
orthogonal. For instance, orthogonality often plays a role in optimization prob-
lems; to determine the shortest path from a point in R3 to a given plane, we
move along a line orthogonal to the plane.

    As Activity 9.3.3 indicates, the dot product provides a simple means to
determine whether two vectors are orthogonal to one another. In this case,
u · v = |u||v| cos(/2) = 0, so we make the following important observation.
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                         37

                   The dot product and orthogonality.
Two vectors u and v in Rn are orthogonal to each other if u · v = 0.

    More generally, the sign of the dot product gives us useful information
about the relative orientation of the vectors. If we remember that

              cos() > 0  if  is an acute angle,
              cos() = 0  if  is a right angle, and
              cos() < 0  if  is an obtuse angle,

we see that for nonzero vectors u and v,

              u·v>0      if  is an acute angle,
              u·v=0      if  is a right angle, and
              u·v<0      if  is an obtuse angle.

This is illustrated in Figure 9.3.6.

9.3.4 Work, Force, and Displacement

In physics, work is a measure of the energy required to apply a force to an object
through a displacement. For instance, Figure 9.3.7 shows a force F displacing
an object from point A to point B. The displacement is then represented by

              --
the vector AB.

                                              F

              A                               B

                              |F| cos 

Figure 9.3.7 A force F displacing an object.
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                  38

It turns out that the work required to displace the object is

                                --  --
                        W = F · AB = |F||AB| cos().

    This means that the work is determined only by the magnitude of the force
applied parallel to the displacement. Consequently, if we are given two vectors
u and v, we would like to write u as a sum of two vectors, one of which is
parallel to v and one of which is orthogonal to v. We take up this task after
the next activity.

Activity 9.3.4 Determine the work done by a 25 pound force acting at a 30
angle to the direction of the object's motion, if the object is pulled 10 feet. In
addition, is more work or less work done if the angle to the direction of the
object's motion is 60?

Figure 9.3.8 Left: projvu. Right: projvu when  > 2 .

Suppose we are given two vectors u and v as shown at left in Figure 9.3.8.

Motivated by our discussion of work, we would like to write u as a sum of two

vectors, one of which is parallel to v and one of which is orthogonal. That is,

we would like to write

                        u = projvu + projvu,                   (9.3.2)

where projvu is parallel to v and projvu is orthogonal to v. We call the
vector projvu the projection of u onto v. Note that, as the diagram at right
in Figure 9.3.8 illustrates, it is also possible to create a projection even if the
angle between the vectors u and v exceeds 2 .

    To find the vector projvu, we will dot both sides of Equation (9.3.2) with
the vector v, to find that

                     u · v = (projvu + projvu) · v
                           = (projvu) · v + (projvu) · v
                           = (projvu) · v.

    Notice that (projvu) · v = 0 since projvu is orthogonal to v. Also,
projvu must be a scalar multiple of v since it is parallel to v, so we will write
projvu = sv. It follows that

                        u · v = (projvu) · v = sv · v,

which means that                     u·v
                                s=

                                     v·v
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                         39

and hence                     u·v u·v
                 projvu = v · v v = |v|2 v

    It is sometimes useful to write projvu as a scalar times a unit vector in the
direction of v. We call this scalar the component of u along v and denote it

as compvu. We therefore have

                 u·v u·v v                      v
                 projvu = |v|2 v = |v| |v| = compvu |v| ,

so that                         u·v
                 compvu = |v| .

                 The dot product and projections.

Let u and v be vectors in Rn. The component of u in the direction of

v is the scalar                 u·v
                 compvu = |v| ,

and the projection of u onto v is the vector

                              u·v
                 projvu = v · v v.

Moreover, since

                 u = projvu + projvu,

it follows that

                 projvu = u - projvu.

    This shows that once we have computed projvu, we can find projvu simply
by calculating the difference of two known vectors.

Activity 9.3.5 Let u = 2, 6 .

a. Let v = 4, -8 . Find compvu, projvu and projvu, and draw a picture
   to illustrate. Finally, express u as the sum of two vectors where one is

   parallel to v and the other is perpendicular to v.

b. Now let v = -2, 4 . Without doing any calculations, find projvu. Ex-
    plain your reasoning. (Hint: Refer to the picture you drew in part (a).)

c. Find a vector w not parallel to z = 3, 4 such that projzw has length
   10. Note that there are infinitely many different answers.

15. When running a sprint, the racers may be aided or slowed by the wind.

      The wind assistance is a measure of the wind speed that is helping push
      the runners down the track. It is much easier to run a very fast race if the
      wind is blowing hard in the direction of the race. So that world records
      aren't dependent on the weather conditions, times are only recorded as
      record times if the wind aiding the runners is less than or equal to 2 meters
      per second. Wind speed for a race is recorded by a wind gauge that is
      set up close to the track. It is important to note, however, that weather
      is not always as cooperative as we might like. The wind does not always
      blow exactly in the direction of the track, so the gauge must account for
      the angle the wind makes with the track. Suppose a 4 mile per hour
      wind is blowing to aid runners by making a 38 angle with the race track.
      Determine if any times set during such a race would qualify as records.

      molecules, such as reactivity, color, and

    As an example of the molecular geometry of a molecule, consider the
methane CH4 molecule, as illustrated in Figure 9.3.9. According to the
Valence Shell Electron Repulsion (VSEPR) model, atoms that surround
single different atoms do so in a way that positions them as far apart as
possible. This means that the hydrogen atoms in the methane molecule
arrange themselves at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. The bond
angle for methane is the angle determined by two consecutive hydrogen
atoms and the central carbon atom. To determine the bond angle for
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS  43

methane, we can place the center carbon atom at the point 21 , 21 , 21 and
the hydrogen atoms at the points (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), and (0, 1, 1).

Find the bond angle for methane to the nearest tenth of a degree.

9.4 The Cross Product

Motivating Questions

   · How and when is the cross product of two vectors defined?

   · What geometric information does the cross product provide?

    The last two sections have introduced some basic algebraic operations on
vectors--addition, scalar multiplication, and the dot product--with useful geo-
metric interpretations. In this section, we will meet a final algebraic operation,
the cross product, which again conveys important geometric information.

    To begin, we must emphasize that the cross product is only defined for
vectors u and v in R3. Also, remember that we use a right-hand coordinate
system, as described in Section 9.1. In particular, recall that the vectors i, j,
and k are oriented as shown below in Figure 9.4.1. Earlier, we noticed that if
we point the index finger of our right hand in the direction of i and our middle
finger in the direction of j, then our thumb points in the direction of k.

                                      k

                                                         j

                      i

Figure 9.4.1 Basis vectors i, j, and k.
Preview Activity 9.4.1 The cross product of two vectors, u and v, will itself
be a vector denoted u × v. The direction of u × v is determined by the right-
hand rule: if we point the index finger of our right hand in the direction of
u and our middle finger in the direction of v, then our thumb points in the
direction of u × v.

   a. We begin by defining the cross products using the vectors i, j, and k.
       Referring to Figure 9.4.1, explain why i, j, k in that order form a right-
       hand system. We then define i × j to be k -- that is i × j = k.

   b. Now explain why i, k, and -j in that order form a right-hand system.
       We then define i × k to be -j -- that is i × k = -j.

   c. Continuing in this way, complete the missing entries in Table 9.4.2.
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS               44

Table 9.4.2 Table of cross products involving i, j, and k.

i×j=k   i × k = -j  j×k=

j×i=    k×i=        k×j=

d. Up to this point, the products you have seen, such as the product of
    real numbers and the dot product of vectors, have been commutative,
    meaning that the product does not depend on the order of the terms.
    For instance, 2 · 5 = 5 · 2. The table above suggests, however, that
    the cross product is anti-commutative: for any vectors u and v in R3,
    u × v = -v × u. If we consider the case when u = v, this shows that
    v × v = -(v × v). What does this tell us about v × v; in particular,
    what vector is unchanged by scalar multiplication by -1?

e. It is not difficult to show that the cross product interacts with scalar
    multiplication and vector addition as one would expect: that is

                                  (cu) × v = c(u × v)
                             (u + v) × w = (u × w) + (v × w)

    We can combine these properties to make cross product calculations a
    bit easier. For example,

                              (2i + j) × k = (2i × k) + (j × k)
                                              = 2(i × k) + (j × k)
                                              = - 2j + i.

    Using these properties along with Table 9.4.2, find the cross product u×v
    if u = 2i + 3j and v = -i + k.

f. Verify that the cross product u×v you just found in part (e) is orthogonal
    to both u and v.

g. Consider the vectors u and v in the xy-plane as shown below in Fig-
    ure 9.4.3.

                           yv

                    ux

length of |u × v|.
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                        45

9.4.1 Computing the cross product

As we have seen in Preview Activity 9.4.1, the cross product u × v is defined

for two vectors u and v in R3 and produces another vector in R3. Using the
right-hand rule, we saw that

i×j=k               i × k = -j              j×k=i
j × i = -k          k×i=j                   k × j = -i

    If, in addition, we assume the cross product behaves like we think a prod-
uct should (e.g., the cross product distributes over vector addition), we can
compute the cross product in terms of the components of general vectors to
find a formula for the cross product. Doing so we see that

u × v = (u1i + u2j + u3k) × (v1i + v2j + v3k)
        = u1i × (v1i + v2j + v3k) + u2j × (v1i + v2j + v3k)
            + u3k × (v1i + v2j + v3k)
        = u1v1i × i + u1v2i × j + u1v3i × k + u2v1j × i + u2v2j × j
            + u2v3j × k + u3v1k × i + u3v2k × j + u3v3k × k
        = u1v2k - u1v3j - u2v1k + u2v3i + u3v1j - u3v2i
        = (u2v3 - u3v2)i - (u1v3 - u3v1)j + (u1v2 - u2v1)k.

(Like the dot product, the cross product arises in physical applications, e.g.,
torque, but it is more convenient mathematically to begin from an algebraic
perspective.)

    The previous calculations lead us to define the cross product of vectors in
R3 as follows.

Definition 9.4.4 The cross product u × v of vectors u = u1i + u2j + u3k
and v = v1i + v2j + v3k in R3 is the vector

             (u2v3 - u3v2)i - (u1v3 - u3v1)j + (u1v2 - u2v1)k.       (9.4.1)

                                                                                                     
    At first, this may look intimidating and difficult to remember. However, if
we rewrite the expression in Equation (9.4.1) using determinants, important
structure emerges. The determinant of a 2 × 2 matrix is

                    a b = ad - bc.
                    cd

It follows that we can thus rewrite Equation (9.4.1) in the form

             u × v = u2 u3 i - u1 u3 j + u1 u2 k.
             v2 v3                v1 v3     v1 v2

For those familiar with the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix, we write the

mnemonic as

                                  i jk

             u × v = u1 u2 u3 .

                                  v1 v2 v3

Activity 9.4.2 Suppose u = 0, 1, 3 and v = 2, -1, 0 . Use the formula
(9.4.1) for the following.

a. Find the cross product u × v.

b. Evaluate the dot products u · (u × v) and v · (u × v). What does this tell
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                          46

       you about the geometric relationship among u, v, and u × v?

   c. Find the cross product v × i.

   d. Multiplication of real numbers is associative, which means, for instance,
       that (2 · 5) · 3 = 2 · (5 · 3). Is it true that the cross product of vectors is
       associative? For instance, is it true that (u × v) × i = u × (v × i)?

   e. Find the cross product u × u.
    The cross product satisfies the following properties, some of which were
illustrated in Preview Activity 9.4.1 and may be easily verified from the defi-
nition (9.4.1).

                           Properties of the cross product.

    Let u, v, and w be vectors in R3, and let c be a scalar. Then
        1. u × v = -(v × u)

        2. (u + v) × w = (u × w) + (v × w)

        3. (cu) × w = c(u × w) = u × (cv)

        4. u × v = 0 if u and v are parallel.

        5. The cross product is not associative; that is, in general

                                    (u × v) × w = u × (v × w).

    Just as we found for the dot product, the cross product provides us with
useful geometric information. In particular, both the length and direction of
the cross product u × v encode information about the geometric relationship
between u and v.

9.4.2 The Length of u × v

We may ask whether the length |u × v| has any relationship to the lengths of
u and v. To investigate, we will compute the square of the length |u × v|2 and
denote by  the angle between u and v, as in Section 9.3. Doing so, we find
through some significant algebra that

   |u × v|2 = (u2v3 - u3v2)2 + (u1v3 - u3v1)2 + (u1v2 - u2v1)2
              = u22v32 - 2u2u3v2v3 + u32v22 + u12v32 - 2u1u3v1v3 + u32v12
                  + u12v22 - 2u1u2v1v2 + u22v12
              = u21(v22 + v32) + u22(v12 + v32) + u23(v12 + v22)
                  - 2(u1u2v1v2 + u1u3v1v3 + u2u3v2v3)
              = u21(v12 + v22 + v32) + u22(v12 + v22 + v32) + u23(v12 + v22 + v32)
                  - (u21v12 + u22v22 + u32v32 + 2(u1u2v1v2 + u1u3v1v3 + u2u3v2v3))
              = (u21 + u22 + u23)(v12 + v22 + v32) - (u1v1 + u2v2 + u3v3)2
              = |u|2|v|2 - (u · v)2

              = |u|2|v|2(1 - cos2())

              = |u|2|v|2 sin2().

Therefore, we have found |u × v|2 = |u|2|v|2 sin2(), which means that

|u × v| = |u||v| sin().                        (9.4.2)
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS  47

    Note that the third property stated above says that u × v = 0 if u and v
are parallel. This is reflected in Equation (9.4.2) since sin() = 0 if u and v
are parallel, which implies that u × v = 0.

    Equation (9.4.2) also has a geometric implication. Consider the parallelo-
gram formed by two vectors u and v, as shown in Figure 9.4.5.

                                                 v

  |v| sin 

            u

Figure 9.4.5 The parallelogram formed by u and v
    Remember that the area of a parallelogram is the product of its base and

height. As shown in the figure, we may consider the base of the parallelogram
to be |u| and the height to be |v| sin(). This means that the area of the
parallelogram formed by u and v is

                                    |u||v| sin() = |u × v|.

    This leads to the following interesting fact.

                          The length of the cross product.

    The length, |u × v|, of the cross product of vectors u and v is the area
    of the parallelogram determined by u and v.

    Note also that if u = u1i + u2j + 0k and v = v1i + v2j + 0k are vectors in
the xy-plane, then Equation (9.4.1) shows that the area of the parallelogram
determined by u and v is |u × v| = |u1v2 - u2v1| is the absolute value of the
2 × 2 determinant u1 u2 . So the absolute value of a determinant of a 2 × 2

                          v1 v2
matrix is also the area of a parallelogram.

Activity 9.4.3

   a. Find the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors u = 1, 3, -2
       and v = 3, 0, 1 .

   b. Find the area of the parallelogram in R3 whose vertices are (1, 0, 1),
       (0, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0), and (1, 1, 0). (Hint: It might be helpful to draw a
       picture to see how the vertices are arranged so you can determine which
       vectors you might use.)

9.4.3 The Direction of u × v

Now that we understand the length of u × v, we will investigate its direction.
Remember from Preview Activity 9.4.1 that cross products involving the vec-
tors i, j, and k resulted in vectors that are orthogonal to the two terms. We
will see that this holds more generally.

    We begin by computing u · (u × v), and see that

      u · (u × v) = u1(u2v3 - u3v2) - u2(u1v3 - u3v1) + u3(u1v2 - u2v1)
                     = u1u2v3 - u1u3v2 - u2u1v3 + u2u3v1 + u3u1v2 - u3u2v1
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS  48

                     =0

    To summarize, we have u · (u × v) = 0, which implies that u is orthogonal
to u × v. In the same way, we can show that v is orthogonal to u × v. The
net effect is that u × v is a vector that is perpendicular to both u and v, and
hence u × v is perpendicular to the plane determined by u and v. Moreover,
the direction of u × v is determined by applying the right-hand rule to u and
v, as we saw in Preview Activity 9.4.1. In light of our earlier work that showed
|u||v| sin() = |u × v|., we may now express u × v in the following different
way.

                       The cross product as normal vector.

    Suppose that u and v are not parallel and that n is the unit vector
    perpendicular to the plane containing u and v determined by the right-
    hand rule. Then

                                    u × v = |u||v| sin() n.

    There is yet one more geometric implication we may draw from this result.

Suppose u, v, and w are vectors in R3 that are not coplanar and that form a
three-dimension parallelepiped as shown in Figure 9.4.6.

Figure 9.4.6 The parallelepiped determined by u, v, and w
    The volume of the parallelepiped is determined by multiplying A, the area

of the base, by the height h. As we have just seen, the area of the base is
|u × v|. Moreover, the height h = |w| cos() where  is the angle between w
and the vector n, which is orthogonal to the plane formed by u and v. Since
n is parallel to u × v, the angle between w and u × v is also . This shows
that

                         |(u × v) · w| = |u × w||w| cos() = Ah,
and therefore

          The cross product and the volume of a parallelepiped.

    The volume of the parallelepiped determined by u, v, and w is |(u ×
    v) · w|.

    As a dot product of two vectors, the quantity (u × v) · w is a scalar and is
called the triple scalar product.

9.4.4 Torque is measured by a cross product

We have seen that the cross product enables us to produce a vector perpen-
dicular to two given vectors, to measure the area of a parallelogram, and to
measure the volume of a parallelepiped. Besides these geometric applications,
the cross product also enables us to describe a physical quantity called torque.

    Suppose that we would like to turn a bolt using a wrench as shown in
Figure 9.4.8. If a force F is applied to the wrench and r is the vector from the
position on the wrench at which the force is applied to center of the bolt, we
define the torque,  , to be

                                             = F × r.

                               F

Figure 9.4.8 A force applied to a wrench
    When a force is applied to an object, Newton's Second Law tells us that the

force is equal to the rate of change of the object's linear momentum. Similarly,
the torque applied to an object is equal to the rate of change of the object's
angular momentum. In other words, torque will cause the bolt to rotate.
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS   50

    In many industrial applications, bolts are required to be tightened using
a specified torque. Of course, the magnitude of the torque is | | = |F × r| =
|F||r|| sin(). Thus, to produce a larger torque, we can increase either |F| or
|r|, which you may know if you have ever removed lug nuts when changing a
flat tire. The ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes said: "Give me a lever
long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world."
A modern spin on this statement is: "Allow me to make |r| large enough, and
I shall produce a torque large enough to move the world."

9.4.5 Comparing the dot and cross products

Finally, it is worthwhile to compare and contrast the dot and cross products.
   · u · v is a scalar, while u × v is a vector.
   · u · v = v · u, while u × v = -v × u
   · u · v = |u||v| cos(), while |u × v| = |u||v| sin().
   · u · v = 0 if u and v are perpendicular, while u × v = 0 if u and v are
       parallel.

9.4.6 Summary

   · The cross product is defined only for vectors in R3. The cross product of
       vectors u = u1i + u2j + u3k and v = v1i + v2j + v3k in R3 is the vector

                u × v = (u2v3 - u3v2)i - (u1v3 - u3v1)j + (u1v2 - u2v1)k.

   · Geometrically, the cross product is

                                      u × v = |u| |v| sin() n,

       where  is the angle between u and v and n is a unit vector perpendicular
       to both u and v as determined by the right-hand rule.

   · The cross product of vectors u and v is a vector perpendicular to both
       u and v.

   · The magnitude |u×v| of the cross product of the vectors u and v gives the
       area of the parallelogram determined by u and v. Also, the scalar triple
       product |(u × v) · w| gives the volume of the parallelepiped determined
       by u, v, and w.

14. One of the properties of the cross product is that (u + v) × w = (u × w) +

CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                        53

vector addition on the left.

b. Use the properties of the cross product to show that in general

              for any vectors x, y, and z in R3.

15. Let u = u1, u2, u3 , v = v1, v2, v3 , and w = w1, w2, w3 be vectors in

          a. Show that (u × v) · w = v1 v2 v3 .

                                                  w1 w2 w3

              u1 u2 u3  v1 v2 v3

b. Show that v1 v2 v3 = - u1 u2 u3 . Conclude that

              w1 w2 w3  w1 w2 w3

interchanging the first two rows in a 3 × 3 matrix changes the sign

of the determinant. In general (although we won't show it here),

interchanging any two rows in a 3 × 3 matrix changes the sign of the

determinant.

c. Use the results of parts (a) and (b) to argue that

              (u × v) · w = (w × u) · v = (v × w) · u.

d. Now suppose that u, v, and w do not lie in a plane when they
    eminate from a common initial point.

      a. Given that the parallepiped determined by u, v, and w must
          have positive volume, what can we say about (u × v) · w?

      b. Now suppose that u, v, and w all lie in the same plane. What
          value must (u × v) · w have? Why?

       c. Explain how (i.) and (ii.) show that if u, v, and w all emi-
          nate from the same initial point, then u, v, and w lie in the
          same plane if and only if (u × v) · w = 0. This provides a
          straightforward computational method for determining when
          three vectors are co-planar.

9.5 Lines and Planes in Space

Motivating Questions

   · How are lines in R3 similar to and different from lines in R2?
   · What is the role that vectors play in representing equations of lines,

       particularly in R3?
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                                      54

· How can we think of a plane as a set of points determined by a point and
   a vector?

· How do we find the equation of a plane through three given non-collinear
   points?

    In single variable calculus, we learn that a differentiable function is lo-
cally linear. In other words, if we zoom in on the graph of a differentiable
function at a point, the graph looks like the tangent line to the function at
that point. Linear functions played important roles in single variable calcu-
lus, useful in approximating differentiable functions, in approximating roots of
functions (see Newton's Method), and approximating solutions to first order
differential equations (see Euler's Method). In multivariable calculus, we will
soon study curves in space; differentiable curves turn out to be locally linear
as well. In addition, as we study functions of two variables, we will see that
such a function is locally linear at a point if the surface defined by the function
looks like a plane (the tangent plane) as we zoom in on the graph.

    Consequently, it is important for us to understand both lines and planes
in space, as these define the linear functions in R2 and R3. (Recall that a
function is linear if it is a polynomial function whose terms all have degree less
than or equal to 1. For example, x defines a single variable linear function and
x + y a two variable linear function, but xy is not linear since it has degree
two, the sum of the degress of its factors.) We begin our work by considering
some familiar ideas in R2 but from a new perspective.

Preview Activity 9.5.1 We are familiar with equations of lines in the plane

in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and (0, b) is the y-

intercept. In this activity, we explore a more flexible way of representing lines

that we can use not only in the plane, but in higher dimensions as well.

To  begin,  consider  the  line  through  the  point  (2, -1)  with  slope  2  as  shown
                                                                            3

in Figure 9.5.1.

a. Suppose we increase x by 1 from the point (2, -1). How does the y-value
    change? What is the point on the line with x-coordinate 3?

b. Suppose we decrease x by 3.25 from the point (2, -1). How does the
    y-value change? What is the point on the line with x-coordinate -1.25?

c. Now, suppose we increase x by some arbitrary value 3t from the point
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS        55

    (2, -1). How does the y-value change? What is the point on the line
    with x-coordinate 2 + 3t?

d. Observe that the slope of the line is related to any vector whose y-
    component divided by the x-component is the slope of the line. For
    the line in this exercise, we might use the vector 3, 2 , which describes
    the direction of the line. Explain why the terminal points of the vectors
    r(t), where
                                    r(t) = 2, -1 + 3, 2 t,

    trace out the graph of the line through the point (2, -1) with slope 23 .
e. Now we extend this vector approach to R3 and consider a second example.

    Let L be the line in R3 through the point (1, 0, 2) in the direction of the
    vector 2, -1, 4 . Find the coordinates of three distinct points on line L.
    Explain your thinking.

f. Find a vector in the form

                                 r(t) = x0, y0, z0 + a, b, c t

    whose terminal points trace out the line L that is described in (e). That
    is, you should be able to locate any point on the line by determining a
    corresponding value of t.

9.5.1 Lines in Space

In two-dimensional space, a non-vertical line is defined to be the set of points
satisfying the equation

                                           y = mx + b,

for some constants m and b. The value of m (the slope) tells us how the
dependent variable changes for every one unit increase in the independent
variable, while the point (0, b) is the y-intercept and anchors the line to a
location on the y-axis. Alternatively, we can think of the slope as being related
to the vector 1, m , which tells us the direction of the line, as shown on the
left in Figure 9.5.2. Thus, we can identify a line in space by fixing a point P
and a direction v, as shown on the right. Since we also have vectors in space
to provide direction, this same idea of a point and a direction determining a
line works in Rn for any n.

Definition 9.5.3 A line in space is the set of terminal points of vectors ema-

nating from a given point P that are parallel to a fixed vector v.                                                             

The fixed vector v in the definition is called a direction vector for the line.

As we saw in Preview Activity 9.5.1, to find an equation for a line through

point P in the direction of vector v, observe that any vector parallel to v will

have the form tv for some scalar t. So, any vector emanating from the point

P in a direction parallel to the vector v will be of the form

                                                        --                                                              (9.5.1)

is the fixed vector shown in blue, while the direction vector v is the vector

parallel to the vector shown in green (that is, the green vector represents tv,

and the line is traced out by the terminal points of the magenta vector). In

other words, the tips (terminal points) of the magenta vectors (the vectors of
            --

the form OP + tv) trace out the line as t changes.

In particular, the terminal points of the vectors of the form in (9.5.1) de-

fine a linear function r in space of the following form, which is valid in any

dimension.

The vector form of a line through the point P in the direction of the

vector v is

                                          r(t) = r0 + tv,                                                     (9.5.2)

where r0 is the position vector OP from the origin to the point P .

    Of course, it is common to represent lines in the plane using the slope-
intercept equation y = mx + b. The vector form of the line, described above,
is an alternative way to represent lines that has the following two advantages.
First, in two dimensions, we are able to represent vertical lines, whose slope m
is not defined, using a vertical direction vector, such as v = 0, 1 . Second, this
description of lines works in any dimension even though there is no concept of
the slope of a line in more than two dimensions.

9.5.2 The Parametric Equations of a Line

The vector form of a line, r(t) = r0 + tv in Equation (9.5.2), describes a line
as the set of terminal points of the vectors r(t). If we write this in terms of
components letting

         r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t) , r0 = x0, y0, z0 , and v = a, b, c ,

then we can equate the components on both sides of r(t) = r0 + tv to obtain
the equations

            x(t) = x0 + at, y(t) = y0 + bt, and z(t) = z0 + ct,

which describe the coordinates of the points on the line. The variable t repre-
sents an arbitrary scalar and is called a parameter. In particular, we use the
following language.

                        The parametric equations of a line.

    The parametric equations for a line through the point P = (x0, y0, z0)
    in the direction of the vector v = a, b, c are

                 x(t) = x0 + at, y(t) = y0 + bt, z(t) = z0 + ct.

    Notice that there are many different parametric equations for the same line.
For example, choosing another point P on the line or another direction vector
v produces another set of parametric equations. It is sometimes useful to think
of t as a time parameter and the parametric equations as telling us where we
are on the line at each time. In this way, the parametric equations describe a
particular walk taken along the line; there are, of course, many possible ways
to walk along a line.

9.5.3 Planes in Space

Now that we have a way of describing lines, we would like to develop a means
of describing planes in three dimensions. We studied the coordinate planes
and planes parallel to them in Section 9.1. Each of those planes had one of
the variables x, y, or z equal to a constant. We can note that any vector in
a plane with x constant is orthogonal to the vector 1, 0, 0 , any vector in a
plane with y constant is orthogonal to the vector 0, 1, 0 , and any vector in a
plane with z constant is orthogonal to the vector 0, 0, 1 . This idea works in
general to define a plane.

Definition 9.5.6 A plane p in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors

emanating from a given point P0 perpendicular to a fixed vector n, as shown

in Figure 9.5.7.                                                   

                  n = a, b, c                          p
                               P = (x, y, z)

                  P0 = (x0, y0, z0)

Figure 9.5.7 A point P0 on a plane p with a normal vector n

    The definition allows us to find the equation of a plane. Assume that
n = a, b, c , P0 = (x0, y0, z0), and that P = (x, y, z) is an arbitrary point on

                                    --
the plane. Since the vector P P0 lies in the plane, it must be perpendicular to
n. This means that

                                    --
                          0 = n · P P0

                             = n · x, y, z - x0, y0, z0
                             = n · x - x0, y - y0, z - z0
                             = a(x - x0) + b(y - y0) + c(z - z0).

    The fixed vector n perpendicular to the plane is frequently called a normal
vector to the plane. We may now summarize as follows.

                  Equations of a plane.

· The scalar equation of the plane with normal vector n = a, b, c
   containing the point P0 = (x0, y0, z0) is

                  a(x - x0) + b(y - y0) + c(z - z0) = 0.  (9.5.3)

· The vector equation of the plane with normal vector n = a, b, c
   containing the points P0 = (x0, y0, z0) and P = (x, y, z) is

                                   --                     (9.5.4)
                               n · P P0 = 0.

    We may take the scalar equation of a plane a little further and note that
since

                          a(x - x0) + b(y - y0) + c(z - z0) = 0,
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS  59

it equivalently follows that

                              ax + by + cz = ax0 + by0 + cz0.

    That is, we may write an equation of a plane as ax + by + cz = d where
d = n · x0, y0, z0 .

    For instance, if we would like to describe the plane passing through the
point P0 = (4, -2, 1) and perpendicular to the vector n = 1, 2, 1 , we have

                            1, 2, 1 · x, y, z = 1, 2, 1 · 4, -2, 1

or
                                         x + 2y + z = 1.

    Notice that the coefficients of x, y, and z in this description give a vector
perpendicular to the plane. For instance, if we are presented with the plane

                                       -2x + y - 3z = 4,

we know that n = -2, 1, -3 is a vector perpendicular to the plane.

Activity 9.5.4
   a. Write a scalar equation of the plane p1 passing through the point (0, 2, 4)
       and perpendicular to the vector n = 2, -1, 1 .

   b. Is the point (2, 0, 2) on the plane p1?

   c. Write a scalar equation of the plane p2 that is parallel to p1 and passing

       (2, 0, 2) and perpendicular to the plane p3 described by the equation

    Just as two distinct points in space determine a line, three non-collinear

p, it then follows that P0P will be perpendicular to n, and we have, as before,

9.5.4 Summary

   · While lines in R3 do not have a slope, like lines in R2 they can be char-
       acterized by a point and a direction vector. Indeed, we define a line in
       space to be the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given
       point that are parallel to a fixed vector.

· Vectors play a critical role in representing the equation of a line. In
   particular, the terminal points of the vector r(t) = r0 + tv define a linear
   function r in space through the terminal point of the vector r0 in the
   direction of the vector v, tracing out a line in space.

· A plane in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors emanating
   from a given point perpendicular to a fixed vector.

                                                         ---
· If P1, P2, and P3 are non-collinear points in space, the vectors P1P2 and
   ---                                                   --- ---
   and P1P3 are vectors in the plane and the vector n = P1P2 × P1P3 is

   a normal vector to the plane. So any point P in the plane satisfies the
               --

   equation P P1 · n = 0. If we let P = (x, y, z), n = a, b, c be the normal

   vector, and P1 = (x0, y0, z0), we can also represent the plane with the

   equation

                 a(x - x0) + b(y - y0) + c(z - z0) = 0.

10. The vector and parametric forms of a line allow us to easily describe line

segments in space.

    Let P1 = (1, 2, -1) and P2 = (-2, 1, -2), and let L be the line in R3
through P1 and P2 as in Activity 9.5.2.

CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS  63

              value of t makes (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = P2?

          b. What t values describe the line segment between the points P1 and
              P2?

          c. What about the line segment (along the same line) from (7, 4, 1) to
              (-8, -1, -4)?

          d. Now, consider a segment that lies on a different line: parameterize
              the segment that connects point R = (4, -2, 7) to Q = (-11, 4, 27)
              in such a way that t = 0 corresponds to point Q, while t = 2
              corresponds to R.

11. This exercise explores key relationships between a pair of lines. Consider
      the following two lines: one with parametric equations x(s) = 4 - 2s,
      y(s) = -2 + s, z(s) = 1 + 3s, and the other being the line through
      (-4, 2, 17) in the direction v = -2, 1, 5 .

          a. Find a direction vector for the first line, which is given in parametric
              form.

          b. Find parametric equations for the second line, written in terms of
              the parameter t.

          c. Show that the two lines intersect at a single point by finding the
              values of s and t that result in the same point. Then find the point
              of intersection.

          d. Find the acute angle formed where the two lines intersect, noting
              that this angle will be given by the acute angle between their re-
              spective direction vectors.

          e. Find an equation for the plane that contains both of the lines de-
              scribed in this problem.

12. This exercise explores key relationships between a pair of planes. Consider
      the following two planes: one with scalar equation 4x - 5y + z = -2,
      and the other which passes through the points (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, -1), and
      (4, 2, -1).

          a. Find a vector normal to the first plane.

          b. Find a scalar equation for the second plane.

          c. Find the angle between the planes, where the angle between them
              is defined by the angle between their respective normal vectors.

          d. Find a point that lies on both planes.

          e. Since these two planes do not have parallel normal vectors, the
              planes must intersect, and thus must intersect in a line. Observe
              that the line of intersection lies in both planes, and thus the direc-
              tion vector of the line must be perpendicular to each of the respective
              normal vectors of the two planes. Find a direction vector for the line
              of intersection for the two planes.

           f. Determine parametric equations for the line of intersection of the
              two planes.

9.6 Vector-Valued Functions

Motivating Questions

   · What is a vector-valued function? What do we mean by the graph of a
       vector-valued function?

· What is a parameterization of a curve in R2? In R3? What can the
   parameterization of a curve can tell us?

    So far, we have seen several different examples of curves in space, including
traces and contours of functions of two variables, as well as lines in 3-space.
Recall that for a line through a fixed point r0 in the direction of vector v, we
may express the line parametrically through the single vector equation

                        r(t) = r0 + tv.

    From this perspective, the vector r(t) is a function that depends on the
parameter t, and the terminal points of this vector trace out the line in space.

    Like lines, other curves in space are one-dimensional objects, and thus we
aspire to similarly express the coordinates of points on a given curve in terms
of a single variable. Vectors are a perfect vehicle for doing so -- we can use
vectors based at the origin to identify points in space, and connect the terminal
points of these vectors to draw a curve in space. This approach will allow us
to draw an incredible variety of graphs in 2- and 3-space, as well as to identify
and describe curves in n-space for any n. It will also allow us to represent
traces and cross sections of surfaces in space.

Preview Activity 9.6.1 In this activity we consider how we might use vectors
to define a curve in space.

   a. On a single set of axes in R2, draw the vectors

· cos(0), sin(0) ,

·  cos     , sin     ,
        2         2

· cos () , sin () , and

· cos 32 , sin 32

with their initial points at the origin.

b. On the same set of axes, draw the vectors

·  cos     , sin     ,
        4         4

· cos 34 , sin 34 ,
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS  65

      · cos 54 , sin 54 , and
      · cos 74 , sin 74

    with their initial points at the origin.

c. Based on the pictures from parts (a) and (b), sketch the set of terminal
    points of all of the vectors of the form cos(t), sin(t) , where t assumes
    values from 0 to 2. What is the resulting figure? Why?

d. Suppose we sketched the terminal points of all vectors of the form cos(t), sin(t) ,
    where t assumes values from 0 to . How does the resulting picture differ
    from the one in part (c)? What about for t from 0 to 4?

9.6.1 Vector-Valued Functions

Consider the curve shown in Figure 9.6.1. As in Preview Activity 9.6.1, we
can think of a point on this curve as resulting from a vector from the origin to
the point. As the point travels along the curve, the vector changes in order to
terminate at the desired point. A few still pictures of this motion are shown
in Figure 9.6.1.

Figure 9.6.1 The graph of a curve in space.

    Thus, we can think of the curve as a collection of terminal points of vectors
emanating from the origin. We therefore view a point traveling along this curve
as a function of time t, and define a function r whose input is the variable t
and whose output is the vector from the origin to the point on the curve at
time t. In so doing, we have introduced a new type of function, one whose
input is a scalar and whose output is a vector.

    The terminal points of the vector outputs of r then trace out the curve
in space. From this perspective, the x, y, and z coordinates of the point are
functions of time, t, say

                        x = x(t), y = y(t), and z = z(t),

and thus we have three coordinate functions that enable us to represent the
curve. The variable t is called a parameter and the equations x = x(t), y = y(t),
and z = z(t) are called parametric equations (or a parameterization of the
curve). The function r whose output is the vector from the origin to a point
on the curve is defined by

                                    r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t) .

    Note that the input of r is the real-valued parameter t and the correspond-
ing output is vector x(t), y(t), z(t) . Such a function is called a vector-valued
function because each real number input generates a vector output. More
formally, we state the following definition.
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                         66

Definition 9.6.2 A vector-valued function is a function whose input is a
real parameter t and whose output is a vector that depends on t. The graph of
a vector-valued function is the set of all terminal points of the output vectors
with their initial points at the origin.

    Parametric equations for a curve are equations of the form

x = x(t), y = y(t), and z = z(t)

that describe the (x, y, z) coordinates of a point on a curve in R3.  

Note particularly that every set of parametric equations determines a vector-

valued function of the form

                             r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t) ,

and every vector-valued function defines a set of parametric equations for a

curve. Moreover, we can consider vector-valued functions and parameteriza-
tions in R2, R4, or indeed a real space of any dimension. As a reminder, in
Section 9.5, we determined the parametric equations of a line in space using a

point and a direction vector. For a nonlinear example, the curve in Figure 9.6.1

has the parametric equations

x(t) = cos(t), y(t) = sin(t), and z(t) = cos(t) sin(t).

    Represented as a vector-valued function r, the curve in Figure 9.6.1 is the
graph of

                             r(t) = cos(t), sin(t), cos(t) sin(t) .

Activity 9.6.2 The same curve can be represented with different parame-
terizations. Use appropriate technology to plot the curves generated by the
following vector-valued functions for values of t from 0 to 2. Compare and
contrast the graphs -- explain how they are alike and how they are different.

   a. r(t) = sin(t), cos(t)

   b. r(t) = sin(2t), cos(2t)

   c. r(t) = cos(t + ), sin(t + )

   d. r(t) = cos(t2), sin(t2)
    The examples in Activity 9.6.2 illustrate that a parameterization allows us
to look not only at the graph, but at the direction and speed at which the
graph is traversed as t changes. In the different parameterizations of the circle,
we see that we can start at different points and move around the circle in either
direction. The calculus of vector-valued functions -- which we will begin to
investigate in Section 9.7 -- will enable us to precisely quantify the direction,
speed, and acceleration of a particle moving along a curve in space. As such,
describing curves parametrically will allow us to not only indicate the curve
itself, but also to describe how motion occurs along the curve.
    Using parametric equations to define vector-valued functions in two dimen-
sions is much more versatile than just defining y as a function of x. In fact, if
y = f (x) is a function of x, then we can parameterize the graph of f by

                             r(t) = t, f (t) ,

and thus every single-variable function may be described parametrically. In
addition, as we saw in Preview Activity 9.6.1 and Activity 9.6.2, we can use
vector-valued functions to represent curves in the plane that do not define y as
a function of x (or x as a function of y). (As a side note: vector-valued functions
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS  67

make it easy to plot the inverse of a one-to-one function in two dimensions. To
see how, if y = f (x)defines a one-to-one function, then we can parameterize
this function by r(t) = t, f (t) . Since the inverse function just reverses the
role of input and output, a parameterization for f -1 is f (t), t .)

Activity 9.6.3 Vector-valued functions can be used to generate many inter-
esting curves. Graph each of the following using an appropriate technological
tool, and then write one sentence for each function to describe the behavior of
the resulting curve.

   a. r(t) = t cos(t), t sin(t)

   b. r(t) = sin(t) cos(t), t sin(t)

   c. r(t) = sin(5t), sin(4t)

   d. r(t) = t2 sin(t) cos(t), 0.9t cos(t2), sin(t) (Note that this defines a curve
       in 3-space.)

   e. Experiment with different formulas for x(t) and y(t) and ranges for t
       to see what other interesting curves you can generate. Share your best
       results with peers.

    Recall from our earlier work that the traces and level curves of a function
are themselves curves in space. Thus, we may determine parameterizations for
them. For example, if z = f (x, y) = cos(x2+y2), the y = 1 trace of the function
is given by setting y = 1 and letting x be parameterized by the variable t; then,
the trace is the curve whose parameterization is t, 1, cos(t2 + 1) .

Activity 9.6.4 Consider the paraboloid defined by f (x, y) = x2 + y2.

   a. Find a parameterization for the x = 2 trace of f . What type of curve
       does this trace describe?

   b. Find a parameterization for the y = -1 trace of f . What type of curve
       does this trace describe?

   c. Find a parameterization for the level curve f (x, y) = 25. What type of
       curve does this trace describe?

   d. How do your responses change to all three of the preceding questions if
       you instead consider the function g defined by g(x, y) = x2 - y2? (Hint
       for generating one of the parameterizations: sec2(t) - tan2(t) = 1.)

9.6.2 Summary

   · A vector-valued function is a function whose input is a real parameter t
       and whose output is a vector that depends on t. The graph of a vector-
       valued function is the set of all terminal points of the output vectors with
       their initial points at the origin.

   · Every vector-valued function provides a parameterization of a curve. In
       R2, a parameterization of a curve is a pair of equations x = x(t) and
       y = y(t) that describes the coordinates of a point (x, y) on the curve in
       terms of a parameter t. In R3, a parameterization of a curve is a set
       of three equations x = x(t), y = y(t), and z = z(t) that describes the
       coordinates of a point (x, y, z) on the curve in terms of a parameter t.

              likewise for x = -2, -1, 0, and 1.

          b. Determine a vector-valued function r that parameterizes the curve
              which is the y = 2 trace of z = f (x, y). Plot the resulting curve. Do

          c. Determine a vector-valued function r that parameterizes the curve

                                     x = 3 + 1s, y = 3 - 2s, z = 2s.

              Then, find a vector-valued function r that parameterizes the line
              that passes through the point of intersection you just found and is
              perpendicular to both of the given lines.

9.7 Derivatives and Integrals of Vector-Valued
     Functions

Motivating Questions

   · What do we mean by the derivative of a vector-valued function and how
       do we calculate it?

· What does the derivative of a vector-valued function measure?

· What do we mean by the integral of a vector-valued function and how
   do we compute it?

· How do we describe the motion of a projectile if the only force acting on
   the object is acceleration due to gravity?

A vector-valued function r determines a curve in space as the collection of

terminal points of the vectors r(t). If the curve is smooth, it is natural to ask

whether r(t) has a derivative. In the same way, our experiences with integrals

in single-variable calculus prompt us to wonder what the integral of a vector-

valued function might be and what it might tell us. We explore both of these

questions in detail in this section.

For now, let's recall some important ideas from calculus I. Given a function

s that measures the position of an object moving along an axis, its derivative,

s , is defined by

                        s (t) = lim         s(t + h) - s(t)             ,

                                      h0                h

and measures the instantaneous rate of change of s with respect to time. In
particular, for a fixed value t = a, s (a) measures the velocity of the moving
object, as well as the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = s(t) at the
point (a, s(a)).

    As we work with vector-valued functions, we will strive to update these
ideas and perspectives into the context of curves in space and outputs that are
vectors.

Preview Activity 9.7.1 Let r(t) = cos(t)i+sin(2t)j describe the path traveled
by an object at time t.

a. Use appropriate technology to help you sketch the graph of the vector-
   valued function r, and then locate and label the point on the graph when
   t = .

b. Recall that for functions of a single variable, the derivative of a sum is

the  sum  of       the  derivatives;  that  is,  d   [  f  (  x)  +  g  (  x  )]  =  f  (x) + g  (x).  With
                                                 dx

this idea in mind and viewing i and j as constant vectors, what do you

expect the derivative of r to be? Write a proposed formula for r (t).

c. Use your result from part (b) to compute r (). Sketch this vector r ()
   as emanating from the point on the graph of r when t =  , and explain
   what you think r () tells us about the object's motion.

9.7.1 The Derivative

In single variable calculus, we define the derivative, f , of a given function f

by

                               f (x) = lim  f (x + h) - f (x)     ,

                                      h0          h

provided the limit exists. At a given value of a, f (a) measures the instanta-
neous rate of change of f , and also tells us the slope of the tangent line to the
curve y = f (x) at the point (a, f (a)). The definition of the derivative extends
naturally to vector-valued functions and curves in space.

Definition 9.7.1 The derivative of a vector-valued function r is defined to

be                                             r(t + h) - r(t)

                               r (t) = lim        h
                                           h0

for  those  values  of  t  at  which  the  limit  exists.  We  also  use  the  notation  dr  and
                                                                                         dt
ddt [r(t)] for r (t).
                                                                                             

Activity 9.7.2 Let's investigate how we can interpret the derivative r (t). Let
r be the vector-valued function whose graph is shown in Figure 9.7.2, and let h
be a scalar that represents a small change in time. The vector r(t) is the blue
vector in Figure 9.7.2 and r(t + h) is the green vector.

                                                           r(t + h)

                                                               r(t)

Figure 9.7.2 A single difference quotient.

    a. Is the quantity r(t + h) - r(t) a vector or a scalar? Identify this object
        in Figure 9.7.2.

    b. Is h r(t+h)-r(t) a vector or a scalar? Sketch a representative vector h r(t+h)-r(t)
        with h < 1 in Figure 9.7.2.

    c. Think of r(t) as providing the position of an object moving along the
        curve these vectors trace out. What do you think that the vector h r(t+h)-r(t)
        measures? Why? (Hint: You might think analogously about difference
        quotients such as h f(x+h)-f(x) or h s(t+h)-s(t) from calculus I.)

    d. Figure 9.7.3 presents three snapshots of the vectors h r(t+h)-r(t) as we let
        h  0. Write 2-3 sentences to describe key attributes of the vector

                                      lim   r(t + h) - r(t)    .

(Hint: Compare to limits such as limh0 h f(x+h)-f(x) or limh0 h s(t+h)-s(t)
from calculus I, keeping in mind that in three dimensions there is no gen-

eral concept of slope.)

r(t + h)                          r(t + h)                     r(t + h)
               r(t)                            r(t)                        r(t)

Figure 9.7.3 Snapshots of several difference quotients.

    As Activity 9.7.2 indicates, if r(t) determines the position of an object at
time t, then h r(t+h)-r(t) represents the average rate of change in the position of
the object over the interval [t, t + h], which is also the average velocity of the
object on this interval. Thus, the derivative

                     r (t) = lim  r(t + h) - r(t)

                              h0      h

is the instantaneous rate of change of r(t) at time t (for those values of t for

which the limit exists), so r (t) = v(t) is the instantaneous velocity of the

object at time t. Furthermore, we can interpret the derivative r (t) as the

direction vector of the line tangent to the graph of r at the value t.

Similarly,

                 v (t) = r (t) = lim  v(t + h) - v(t)

                                  h0       h

is the instantaneous rate of change of the velocity of the object at time t,
for those values of t for which the limits exists, and thus v (t) = a(t) is the
acceleration of the moving object.

    Note well: Both the velocity and acceleration are vector quantities: they
have magnitude and direction. By contrast, the magnitude of the velocity
vector, |v(t)|, which is the speed of the object at time t, is a scalar quantity.

9.7.2 Computing Derivatives

As we learned in single variable calculus, computing derivatives from the defi-
nition is often difficult. Fortunately, properties of the limit make it straightfor-
ward to calculate the derivative of a vector-valued function similar to how we
developed shortcut differentiation rules in calculus I. To see why, recall that
the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, and that we can remove constant
factors from limits. Thus, as we observed in a particular example in Preview
Activity 9.7.1, if r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k, it follows that

r (t) = lim  r(t + h) - r(t)

h0               h

= lim        [x(t + h) - x(t)]i + [y(t + h) - y(t)]j + [z(t + h) - z(t)]k

h0                                    h

= lim           x(t + h) - x(t)   i + lim  y(t + h) - y(t)  j

            h0       h                h0             h

+ lim            z(t + h) - z(t)  k

             h0         h
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                                74

                = x (t)i + y (t)j + z (t)k.

    Thus, we can calculate the derivative of a vector-valued function by simply
differentiating its components.

                   The derivative of a vector-valued function.
    If r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k, then

                               d
                                  r(t) = x (t)i + y (t)j + z (t)k

                               dt
    for those values of t at which x, y, and z are differentiable.

Activity 9.7.3 For each of the following vector-valued functions, find r (t).

   a. r(t) = cos(t), t sin(t), ln(t) .

   b. r(t) = t2 + 3t, e-2t, t2t+1 .

   c. r(t) = tan(t), cos(t2), te-t .
                 

   d. r(t) = t4 + 4, sin(3t), cos(4t) .
    In first-semester calculus, we developed several important differentiation
rules, including the constant multiple, product, quotient, and chain rules. For
instance, recall that we formally state the product rule as

                        d
                          [f (x) · g(x)] = f (x) · g (x) + g(x) · f (x).

                       dx

    There are several analogous rules for vector-valued functions, including a
product rule for scalar functions and vector-valued functions. These rules,
which are easily verified, are summarized as follows.

    Properties of derivatives of vector-valued functions.

Let f be a differentiable real-valued function of a real variable t and let
r and s be differentiable vector-valued functions of the real variable t.
Then

1.  d   [r(t)  +  s(t)]  =     r  (t)  +  s  (t)
    dt

2. ddt [f (t)r(t)] = f (t)r (t) + f (t)r(t)

3.  d   [r(t)  ·  s(t)]  =  r  (t)  ·  s(t)  +  r(t)  ·  s  (t)
    dt

4.  d   [r(t)  ×  s(t)]  =     r  (t)  ×  s(t)  +  r(t)     ×  s  (t)
    dt

5.  d   [r(f (t))]  =    f  (t)r  (f (t)).
    dt

    Note well. When applying these properties, use care to interpret the quan-
tities involved as either scalars or vectors. For example, r(t) · s(t) defines a
scalar function because we have taken the dot product of two vector-valued
functions. However, r(t) × s(t) defines a vector-valued function since we have
taken the cross product of two vector-valued functions.

d. Recall that the speed is |v| = v · v. Find the object's speed and graph
    it as a function of time t on the right of Figure 9.7.4. When is the object's
    speed the slowest? When is the speed increasing? When is it decreasing?

e. What seems to be true about the angle between v and a when the speed
    is at a minimum? What is the angle between v and a when the speed is
    increasing? when the speed is decreasing?

f. Since the square root is an increasing function, we see that the speed
    increases precisely when v · v is increasing. Use the product rule for the
    dot product to express ddt (v·v) in terms of the velocity v and acceleration
    a. Use this to explain why the speed is increasing when v · a > 0 and
    decreasing when v · a < 0. Compare this to part (d).

9.7.3 Tangent Lines

One of the most important ideas in first-semester calculus is that a differen-
tiable function is locally linear: that is, when viewed up close, the curve gener-
ated by a differentiable function looks very much like a line. Indeed, when we
zoom in sufficiently far on a particular point, the curve looks indistinguishable
from its tangent line.
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS        76

    In the same way, we expect that a smooth curve in 3-space will be locally
linear. In the following activity, we investigate how to find the tangent line to
such a curve. Recall from our work in Section 9.5 that the vector equation of
a line that passes through the point at the tip of the vector L0 = x0, y0, z0
in the direction of the vector u = a, b, c can be written as

                     L(t) = L0 + tu.

In parametric form, the line L is given by

x(t) = x0 + at, y(t) = y0 + bt, z(t) = z0 + ct.

Activity 9.7.5 Let

                     r(t) = cos(t)i - sin(t)j + tk.

Sketch the curve using some appropriate tool.

a. Determine the coordinates of the point on the curve traced out by r(t)
   when t = .

b. Find a direction vector for the line tangent to the graph of r at the point
    where t = .

c. Find the parametric equations of the line tangent to the graph of r when
   t = .

d. Sketch a plot of the curve r(t) and its tangent line near the point where
    t = . In addition, include a sketch of r (). What is the important role
    of r () in this activity?

We see that our work in Activity 9.7.5 can be generalized. Given a differ-

entiable vector-valued function r, the tangent line to the curve at the input

value a is given by

                     L(t) = r(a) + tr (a).           (9.7.1)

    Here we see that because the tangent line is determined entirely by a given
point and direction, the point is provided by the function r, evaluated at t = a,
while the direction is provided by the derivative, r , again evaluated at t = a.
Note how analogous the formula for L(t) is to the tangent line approximation
from single-variable calculus: in that context, for a given function y = f (x) at
a value x = a, we found that the tangent line can be expressed by the linear
function y = L(x) whose formula is

                     L(x) = f (a) + f (a)(x - a).

    Equation (9.7.1) for the tangent line L(t) to the vector-valued function r(t)
is nearly identical. Indeed, because there are multiple parameterizations for a
single line, it is even possible to write the parameterization as

                     L(t) = r(a) + (t - a)r (a).     (9.7.2)

(For example, in Equation (9.7.1), L(0) = r(a), so the line's parameterization
"starts" at t = 0. When we write the parameterization in the form of Equa-
tion (9.7.2), L(a) = r(a), so the line's parameterization "starts" at t = a.)

    As we will learn more in Chapter 10, a smooth surface in 3-space is also
locally linear. That means that the surface will look like a plane, which we call
its tangent plane, as we zoom in on the graph. It is possible to use tangent
lines to traces of the surface to generate a formula for the tangent plane; see
Exercise 9.7.7.15 at the end of this section for more details.

9.7.4 Integrating a Vector-Valued Function

Recall from single variable calculus that an antiderivative of a function f of
the independent variable x is a function F that satisfies F (x) = f (x). We
then defined the indefinite integral f (x) dx to be the general antiderivative
of f . Recall that the general antiderivative includes an added constant C in
order to indicate that the general antiderivative is in fact an entire family of
functions. We can do the similar work with vector-valued functions.
Definition 9.7.5 An antiderivative of a vector-valued function r is a vector-
valued function R such that

                                           R (t) = r(t).

    The indefinite integral r(t) dt of a vector-valued function r is the gen-
eral antiderivative of r and represents the collection of all antiderivatives of r.

                                                                                                     
    The same reasoning that allows us to differentiate a vector-valued function
componentwise applies to integrating as well. Recall that the integral of a sum
is the sum of the integrals and also that we can remove constant factors from
integrals. So, given r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k, it follows that we can integrate
componentwise. Expressed more formally,

                       Integrating a vector-valued function.

    If r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k, then

r(t) dt = x(t) dt i + y(t) dt j + z(t) dt k.

    In light of being able to integrate and differentiate componentwise with
vector-valued functions, we can solve many problems that are analogous to
those we encountered in single-variable calculus. For instance, recall problems
where we were given an object moving along an axis with velocity function
v and an initial position s(0). In that context, we were able to differentiate
v in order to find acceleration, and integrate v and use the initial condition
in order to find the position function s. In the following activity, we explore
similar ideas with vector-valued functions.

Activity 9.7.6 Suppose a moving object in space has its velocity given by

v(t) = (-2 sin(2t))i + (2 cos(t))j + 1 -              1       k.

                                                      1+t

    A graph of the position of the object for times t in [-0.5, 3] is shown in
Figure 9.7.6. Suppose further that the object is at the point (1.5, -1, 0) at
time t = 0.

a. Determine a(t), the acceleration of the object at time t.

b. Determine r(t), position of the object at time t.

c. Compute and sketch the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors of
   the object at time t = 1, using Figure 9.7.6.

d. Finally, determine the vector equation for the tangent line, L(t), that is
    tangent to the position curve at t = 1.

9.7.5 Projectile Motion

Any time that an object is launched into the air with a given velocity and
launch angle, the path the object travels is determined almost exclusively by
the force of gravity. Whether in sports such as archery or shotput, in military
applications with artillery, or in important fields like firefighting, it is important
to be able to know when and where a launched projectile will land. We can use
our knowledge of vector-valued functions in order to completely determine the
path traveled by an object that is launched from a given position at a given
angle from the horizontal with a given initial velocity.

                        v(0)

                              

                    (x0, y0)

Figure 9.7.7 Projectile motion.

    Assume we fire a projectile from a launcher and the only force acting on
the fired object is the force of gravity pulling down on the object. That is, we
assume no effect due to spin, wind, or air resistance. With these assumptions,
the motion of the object will be planar, so we can also assume that the motion
occurs in two-dimensional space. Suppose we launch the object from an initial
position (x0, y0) at an angle  with the positive x-axis as illustrated in Fig-
ure 9.7.7, and that we fire the object with an initial speed of v0 = |v(0)|, where
v(t) is the velocity vector of the object at time t. Assume g is the positive
constant acceleration force due to gravity, which acts to pull the fired object
toward the ground (in the negative y direction). Note particularly that there
is no external force acting on the object to move it in the x direction.

    We first observe that since gravity only acts in the downward direction
and that the acceleration due to gravity is constant, the acceleration vector
is 0, -g . That is, a(t) = 0, -g . We may use this fact about acceleration,
together with the initial position and initial velocity in order to fully determine
the position r(t) of the object at time t. In Exercise 9.7.7.17, you can work
through the details to show that the following general formula holds.
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                                  79

                          The motion of a projectile.

If an object is launched from a point (x0, y0) with initial velocity v0 at
an angle  with the horizontal, then the position of the object at time
t is given by

              r(t) = v0 cos()t + x0, - g t2 + v0 sin()t + y0 .
                                                2

    This assumes that the only force acting on the object is the acceleration g
due to gravity.

9.7.6 Summary

   · If r is a vector-valued function, then the derivative of r is defined by

r (t) = lim  r(t + h) - r(t)

h0           h

for those values of t at which the limit exists, and is computed compo-
nentwise by the formula

r (t) = x (t)i + y (t)j + z (t)k

for those values of t at which x, y, and z are differentiable, where r(t) =
x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k.

· The derivative r (t) of the vector-valued function r tells us the instanta-
   neous rate of change of r with respect to time, t, which can be interpreted
   as a direction vector for the line tangent to the graph of r at the point
   r(t), or also as the instantaneous velocity of an object traveling along the
   graph defined by r(t) at time t.

· An antiderivative of r is a vector-valued function R such that R (t) =
   r(t). The indefinite integral r(t) dt of a vector-valued function r is the
   general antiderivative of r (which is a collection of all of the antideriva-
   tives of r, with any two antiderivatives differing by at most a constant
   vector). Moreover, if r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k, then

r(t) dt = x(t) dt i + y(t) dt j + z(t) dt k.

   · If an object is launched from a point (x0, y0) with initial velocity v0 at
       an angle  with the horizontal, then the position of the object at time t
       is given by

                       r(t) = v0 cos()t + x0, - g t2 + v0 sin()t + y0 ,
                                                         2

       provided that that the only force acting on the object is the acceleration
       g due to gravity.

   a. Determine the point of intersection of the curves generated by r(t)
       and w(s). To do so, you will have to find values of a and b that
       result in r(a) and w(b) being the same vector.

b. Use the value of a you determined in (a) to find a vector form of the
    tangent line to r(t) at the point where t = a.

c. Use the value of b you determined in (a) to find a vector form of the
   tangent line to w(s) at the point where s = b.

          d. Suppose that z = f (x, y) is a function that generates a surface in
              three-dimensional space, and that the curves generated by r(t) and
              w(s) both lie on this surface. Note particularly that the point of

17. In this exercise, we develop the formula for the position function of a
      projectile that has been launched at an initial speed of |v0| and a launch
      angle of . Recall that a(t) = 0, -g is the constant acceleration of the
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS  84

      projectile at any time t.

          a. Find all velocity vectors for the given acceleration vector a. When
              you anti-differentiate, remember that there is an arbitrary constant
              that arises in each component.

          b. Use the given information about initial speed and launch angle to
              find v0, the initial velocity of the projectile. You will want to write
              the vector in terms of its components, which will involve sin() and
              cos().

          c. Next, find the specific velocity vector function v for the projectile.
              That is, combine your work in (a) and (b) in order to determine
              expressions in terms of |v0| and  for the constants that arose when
              integrating.

              determined in (c).

              show it follows that

                        r(t) = |v0| cos()t + x0, - g t2 + |v0| sin()t + y0 .

18. A central force is one that acts on an object so that the force F is parallel to
      the object's position r. Since Newton's Second Law says that an object's
      acceleration is proportional to the force exerted on it, the acceleration a
      of an object moving under a central force will be parallel to its position r.
      For instance, the Earth's acceleration due to the gravitational force that
      the sun exerts on the Earth is parallel to the Earth's position vector as

9.8 Arc Length and Curvature

Motivating Questions

   · How can a definite integral be used to measure the length of a curve in
       2- or 3-space?

· Why is arc length useful as a parameter?

   · What is the curvature of a curve?

    Given a space curve, there are two natural geometric questions one might
ask: how long is the curve and how much does it bend? In this section, we
answer both questions by developing techniques for measuring the length of a
space curve as well as its curvature.

Preview Activity 9.8.1 In earlier investigations, we have used integration
to calculate quantities such as area, volume, mass, and work. We are now
interested in determining the length of a space curve.

    Consider the smooth curve in 3-space defined by the vector-valued function
r, where

                        r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t) = cos(t), sin(t), t

for t in the interval [0, 2]. Pictures of the graph of r are shown in Figure 9.8.1.
We will use the integration process to calculate the length of this curve. In
this situation we partition the interval [0, 2] into n subintervals of equal length
and let 0 = t0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tn = b be the endpoints of the subintervals.
We then approximate the length of the curve on each subinterval with some
related quantity that we can compute. In this case, we approximate the length
of the curve on each subinterval with the length of the segment connecting the
endpoints. Figure 9.8.1 illustrates the process in three different instances using
increasing values of n.

9.8.1 Arc Length

Consider a smooth curve in 3-space that is parametrically described by the
vector-valued function r defined by r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t) . Preview Activ-
ity 9.8.1 shows that to approximate the length of the curve defined by r(t)
as the values of t run over an interval [a, b], we partition the interval [a, b]
into n subintervals of equal length t, with a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b
as the endpoints of the subintervals. On each subinterval, we approximate
the length of the curve by the length of the line segment connecting the end-
points. The points on the curve corresponding to t = ti-1 and t = ti are
(x(ti-1), y(ti-1), z(ti-1)) and (x(ti), y(ti), z(ti)), respectively, so the length of
the line segment connecting these points is

               (x(ti) - x(ti-1))2 + (y(ti) - y(ti-1))2 + (z(ti) - z(ti-1))2.

    Now we add all of these approximations together to obtain an approxima-
tion to the length L of the curve:

          n    (x(ti) - x(ti-1))2 + (y(ti) - y(ti-1))2 + (z(ti) - z(ti-1))2.

L

         i=1

    We now want to take the limit of this sum as n goes to infinity, but in

its present form it might be difficult to see how. We first introduce t by
multiplying by t t , and see that

          n    (x(ti) - x(ti-1))2 + (y(ti) - y(ti-1))2 + (z(ti) - z(ti-1))2

L              (x(ti) - x(ti-1))2 + (y(ti) - y(ti-1))2 + (z(ti) - z(ti-1))2 t
                                                                                          t
         i=1

         i=1

         i=1

    To get the difference quotients under the radical, we use properties of the
square root function to see further that

                                      +                         +                        t.

          n

  =

         i=1

Recall that as n   we also have t  0. Since

               x (t) = lim x(ti) - x(ti-1) ,
               t0                           t

               y (t) = lim y(ti) - y(ti-1) , and
               t0                        t

               z (t) lim z(ti) - z(ti-1) ,
               t0                        t

    Noting further that

|r (t)| = (x (t))2 + (y (t))2 + (z (t))2,

we can rewrite our arclength formula in a more succinct form as follows.

                                              The length of a curve.

If r(t) defines a smooth curve C on an interval [a, b], then the length L

of C is given by

                                                               b

                                              L = |r (t)| dt.                     (9.8.1)

                                              a

    Note that formula (9.8.1) applies to curves in any dimensional space. More-
over, this formula has a natural interpretation: if r(t) records the position of a
moving object, then r (t) is the object's velocity and |r (t)| its speed. Formula
(9.8.1) says that we simply integrate the speed of an object traveling over the
curve to find the distance traveled by the object, which is the same as the
length of the curve, just as in one-variable calculus.

Activity 9.8.2 Here we calculate the arc length of two familiar curves.

   a. Use Equation (9.8.1) to calculate the circumference of a circle of radius
       r.

   b. Find the exact length of the spiral defined by r(t) = cos(t), sin(t), t on
       the interval [0, 2].

    We can adapt the arc length formula to curves in 2-space that define y as
a function of x as the following activity shows.

Activity 9.8.3 Let y = f (x) define a smooth curve in 2-space. Parameterize
this curve and use Equation (9.8.1) to show that the length of the curve defined
by f on an interval [a, b] is

                                                           b

                                              1 + [f (t)]2 dt.

9.8.2 Parameterizing With Respect To Arc Length

In addition to helping us to find the length of space curves, the expression
for the length of a curve enables us to find a natural parametrization of space
curves in terms of arc length, as we now explain.

    Shown below in Figure 9.8.2 is a portion of the parabola y = x2/2. Of
course, this space curve may be parametrized by the vector-valued function r
defined by r(t) = t, t2/2 as shown on the left, where we see the location at
a few different times t. Notice that the points are not equally spaced on the
curve.

    A more natural parameter describing the points along the space curve is
the distance traveled s as we move along the parabola starting at the origin.
For instance, the right side of Figure 9.8.2 shows the points corresponding to
various values of s. We call this an arc length parametrization.

Figure 9.8.2 The parametrization r(t) (left) and a reparametrization by arc
length.

    To see that this is a more natural parametrization, consider an interstate
highway cutting across a state. One way to parametrize the curve defined by
the highway is to drive along the highway and record our position at every time,
thus creating a function r. If we encounter an accident or road construction,
however, this parametrization might not be at all relevant to another person
driving the same highway. An arc length parametrization, however, is like using
the mile markers on the side of road to specify our position on the highway. If
we know how far we've traveled along the highway, we know exactly where we
are.

    If we begin with a parametrization of a space curve, we can modify it to find
an arc length parametrization, as we now describe. Suppose that the curve is
parametrized by the vector-valued function r = r(t) where t is in the interval
[a, b]. We define the parameter s through the function

                                     t  (x (w))2 + (y (w))2 + (z (w))2 dw,

            s = L(t) =

                                   a

which measures the length along the curve from r(a) to r(t).
    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus shows us that

        ds                  (x (t))2 + (y (t))2 + (z (t))2 = |r (t)|           (9.8.2)
            = L (t) =
        dt

and so                                        td

                            L(t) =            a dw  r(w) dw.

    If we assume that r (t) is never 0, then L (t) > 0 for all t and s = L(t) is
always increasing. This should seem reasonable: unless we stop, the distance
traveled along the curve increases as we move along the curve.

    Since s = L(t) is an increasing function, it is invertible, which means we
may view the time t as a function of the distance traveled; that is, we have
the relationship t = L-1(s). We then obtain the arc length parametrization
by composing r(t) with t = L-1(s) to obtain r(s). Let's illustrate this with an
example.

Example 9.8.3 Consider a circle of radius 5 in 2-space centered at the origin.
We know that we can parameterize this circle as

                            r(t) = 5 cos(t), 5 sin(t) ,

where t runs from 0 to 2. We see that r (t) = -5 sin(t), 5 cos(t) , and hence
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                             89

|r (t)| = 5. It then follows that

                                   t                 t

     s = L(t) = |r (w)| dw = 5 dw = 5t.

                      0                           0

    Since s = L(t) = 5t, we may solve for t in terms of s to obtain t(s) =
L-1(s) = s/5. We then find the arc length parametrization by composing

     r(t(s)) = r(L-1(s)) = 5 cos s , 5 sin s .
                                                  5       5

    More generally, for a circle of radius a centered at the origin, a similar
computation shows that

                                         s        s                       (9.8.3)

                                         a        a

is an arc length parametrization.
    Notice that equation (9.8.2) shows that

                   dr dr ds dr
                      =                     = |r (t)|,
                      dt ds dt ds

so                    dr                    1 dr

                                      =           = 1,
                      ds |r (t)| dt

which means that we move along the curve with unit speed when we parame-

terize by arc length. This is clearly seen in Example 9.8.3 where |r (s)| = 1. It

follows that the parameter s is the distance traveled along the curve, as shown

by:                   sd s

     L(s) =           0 ds            r(w) dw = 1 dw = s.

                                                  0

Activity 9.8.4 In this activity we parameterize a line in 2-space in terms of

arc length. Consider the line with parametric equations

     x(t) = x0 + at and y(t) = y0 + bt.

    a. To write t in terms of s, evaluate the integral

                              t             (x (w))2 + (y (w))2 dw

     s = L(t) =

                            0

     to determine the length of the line from time 0 to time t.

    b. Use the formula from (a) for s in terms of t to write t in terms of s. Then
        explain why a parameterization of the line in terms of arc length is

     x(s) = x0 +   a               s and y(s) = y0 +         b        s.  (9.8.4)

     A little more complicated example is the following.

for t  0 in terms of arc length. To write t in terms of s we find s in terms of

                                         t

                       = t2 + 4t.

    Since t  0, wecan solve the equation s = t2 + 4t (or t2 + 4t - s = 0) for t
                  -4+   16+4s               
to  obtain  t  =       2       =     -2 + 4 + s.  So  we  can  parameterize  our  curve  in

terms of arc length by

                                     28                   3/2    
    r(s) = -2 + 4 + s , -2 + 4 + s , 4 -2 + 4 + s .
                                     3

    These examples illustrate a general method. Of course, evaluating an arc
length integral and finding a formula for the inverse of a function can be diffi-
cult, so while this process is theoretically possible, it is not always practical to
parameterize a curve in terms of arc length. However, we can guarantee that
such a parameterization exists, and this observation plays an important role
in the next section.

9.8.3 Curvature

For a smooth space curve, the curvature measures how fast the curve is bending
or changing direction at a given point. For example, we expect that a line
should have zero curvature everywhere, while a circle (which is bending the
same at every point) should have constant curvature. Circles with larger radii
should have smaller curvatures.

    To measure the curvature, we first need to describe the direction of the
curve at a point. We may do this using a continuously varying tangent vector
to the curve, as shown at left in Figure 9.8.5. The direction of the curve is
then determined by the angle  each tangent vector makes with a horizontal
vector, as shown at right in Figure 9.8.5.

vectors.

    Informally speaking, the curvature will be the rate at which the angle 
is changing as we move along the curve. Of course, this rate of change will
depend on how we move along the curve; if we move with a greater speed
along the curve, then  will change more rapidly. This is why the speed limit
is sometimes lowered when we enter a curve on a highway. In other words, the
rate of change of  will depend on the parametrization we use to describe the
space curve. To eliminate this dependence on the parametrization, we choose
to work with an arc length parametrization r(s), which means we move along
the curve with unit speed.

    Using an arc length parametrization r(s), we define the tangent vector
T(s) = r (s), and note that |T(s)| = 1; that is, T(s) is a unit tangent vector.
We then have T(s) = cos((s)), sin((s)) , which means that

dT             d                  d                                 d
    = - sin((s)) , cos((s)) = - sin((s)), cos((s)) .
ds             ds                 ds                                   ds

Therefore

           dT                                   d d
               = | - sin((s)), cos((s)) |              =
           ds                                   ds ds

This observation leads us to adopt the following definition.

Definition 9.8.6 If C is a smooth space curve and s is an arc length parameter
for C, then the curvature, , of C is

                          = (s) =        dT  .

                                         ds

                                                                                                     
    Note that  is the Greek lowercase letter "kappa".

Activity 9.8.5

   a. We should expect that the curvature of a line is 0 everywhere. To show
       that our definition of curvature measures this correctly in 2-space, recall
       that (9.8.4) gives us the arc length parameterization

           x(s) = x0 +   a        s and y(s) = y0 +           b     s

                         a2 + b2                           a2 + b2

of a line. Use this information to explain why the curvature of a line is 0
everywhere.

b. Recall that an arc length parameterization of a circle in 2-space of radius
    a centered at the origin is, from (9.8.3),

                                      s             s
               r(s) = a cos , a sin                    .
                                      a             a
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS                              92

Show that the curvature of this circle is the constant 1a . What can you
say about the relationship between the size of the radius of a circle and

the value of its curvature? Why does this make sense?

The definition of curvature relies on our ability to parameterize curves in

terms of arc length. Since we have seen that finding an arc length parametriza-

tion can be difficult, we would like to be able to express the curvature in terms

of a more general parametrization r(t).

To begin, we need to describe the vector T, which is a vector tangent to

the curve having unit length. Of course, the velocity vector r (t) is tangent to

the curve; we simply need to normalize its length to be one. This means that

we may take

                               T(t) =    r (t)    .    (9.8.5)

                                         |r (t)|

Then the curvature of the curve defined by r is

                                      dT
                               =

                                      ds

                                   dT dt
                               =

                                    dt ds

                                      dT

                               = ds dt

                                      dt

                               =  |T (t)|  .

                                  |r (t)|

    This last formula allows us to use any parameterization of a curve to cal-
culate its curvature. There is another useful formula, given below, whose
derivation is left for the exercises.

                            Formulas for curvature.

If r is a vector-valued function defining a smooth space curve C, and if
r (t) is not zero and if r (t) exists, then the curvature  of C satisfies

   ·  = (t) = |r (t)| |T (t)|

·  = |r (t)|3 |r (t)×r (t)| .

Activity 9.8.6 Use one of the two formulas for  in terms of t to help you
answer the following questions.

   a. The ellipse a2 x2 + b2 y2 = 1 has parameterization

                                       r(t) = a cos(t), b sin(t) .

       Find the curvature of the ellipse. Assuming 0 < b < a, at what points
       is the curvature the greatest and at what points is the curvature the
       smallest? Does this agree with your intuition?

   b. The standard helix has parameterization r(t) = cos(t)i+sin(t)j+tk. Find
       the curvature of the helix. Does the result agree with your intuition?

    The curvature has another interpretation. Recall that the tangent line to
a curve at a point is the line that best approximates the curve at that point.
The curvature at a point on a curve describes the circle that best approximates
the curve at that point. Remembering that a circle of radius a has curvature
CHAPTER 9. MULTIVARIABLE AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS          93

1/a, then the circle that best approximates the curve near a point on a curve
whose curvature is  has radius 1/ and will be tangent to the tangent line
at that point and has its center on the concave side of the curve. This circle,
called the osculating circle of the curve at the point, is shown in Figure 9.8.7
for a portion of a parabola.

9.8.4 Summary

· The integration process shows that the length L of a smooth curve defined
   by r(t) on an interval [a, b] is

                                    b

                       L = |r (t)| dt.

· Arc length is useful as a parameter because when we parameterize with
   respect to arc length, we eliminate the role of speed in our calculation of
   curvature and the result is a measure that depends only on the geometry
   of the curve and not on the parameterization of the curve.

· We define the curvature  of a curve in 2- or 3-space to be the rate of

change of the magnitude of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc

length, or

                                    =  dT  .

                      r (t) × r (t) =       ds 2  (T(t) × T (t)).

                                            dt

d. In Exercise 9.8.5.14 we showed that |T(t)| = 1 implies that T(t) is
    orthogonal to T (t) for every value of t. Explain what this tells us
    about |T(t) × T (t)| and conclude that

                           |r (t) × r (t)| =     ds 2    |T (t)|.

e. Finally, use the fact that  = |r (t)| |T (t)| to verify that

                                                    |r (t) × r (t)|
                                               = |r (t)|3 .

16. In this exercise we explore how to find the osculating circle for a given
      curve. As an example, we will use the curve defined by f (x) = x2. Recall
      that this curve can be parameterized by x(t) = t and y(t) = t2.

          a. Use (9.8.5) to find T(t) for our function f .

b. To find the center of the osculating circle, we will want to find a
    vector that points from a point on the curve to the center of the
    circle. Such a vector will be orthogonal to the tangent vector at
    that point. Recall that T(s) = cos((s)), sin((s)) , where  is
    the angle the tangent vector to the curve makes with a horizontal
    vector. Use this fact to show that

                                      dT
                                  T · = 0.

                                       ds

Explain why this tells us that        dT   is orthogonal to T.   Let N be the
                                      ds
unit vector in the direction of ds dT . The vector N is called the prin-

cipal unit normal vector and points in the direction toward which

the curve is turning. The vector N also points toward the center of

the osculating circle.

c. Find T at the point (1, 1) on the graph of f . Then find N at this
   same point. How do you know you have the correct direction for N?

Let P be a point on the curve. Re-

call  that    =  1  at  point  P  is  the
                 

radius of the osculating circle at

point P . We call  the radius of

Which vector, in terms of  and N points from the point P to the

e. Finally, use the previous work to find the center of the osculating
   circle for f at the point (1, 1). Draw pictures of the curve and the
   osculating circle to verify your work.

10.1 Limits

Motivating Questions

   · What do we mean by the limit of a function f of two variables at a point
       (a, b)?

   · What techniques can we use to show that a function of two variables does
       not have a limit at a point (a, b)?

   · What does it mean for a function f of two variables to be continuous at
       a point (a, b)?

    In this section, we will study limits of functions of several variables, with
a focus on limits of functions of two variables. In single variable calculus, we
studied the notion of limit, which turned out to be a critical concept that
formed the basis for the derivative and the definite integral. In this section we
will begin to understand how the concept of limit for functions of two variables
is similar to what we encountered for functions of a single variable. The limit
will again be the fundamental idea in multivariable calculus, and we will use
this notion of the limit of a function of several variables to define the important
concept of differentiability later in this chapter. We have already seen its use
in the derivatives of vector-valued functions in Section 9.7.

    Let's begin by reviewing what we mean by the limit of a function of one
variable. We say that a function f has a limit L as x approaches a provided
that we can make the values f (x) as close to L as we like by taking x sufficiently
close (but not equal) to a. We denote this behavior by writing

                                          lim f (x) = L.

10.1.1 Limits of Functions of Two Variables

In Preview Activity 10.1.1, we recalled the notion of limit from single variable
calculus and saw that a similar concept applies to functions of two variables.
Though we will focus on functions of two variables, for the sake of discussion,
all the ideas we establish here are valid for functions of any number of variables.
In a natural followup to our work in Preview Activity 10.1.1, we now formally
define what it means for a function of two variables to have a limit at a point.

Definition 10.1.9 Given a function f = f (x, y), we say that f has limit L
as (x, y) approaches (a, b) provided that we can make f (x, y) as close to L
as we like by taking (x, y) sufficiently close (but not equal) to (a, b). We write

                      lim f (x, y) = L.

                  (x,y)(a,b)

                                                                                                     
    To investigate the limit of a single variable function, limxa f (x), we often
consider the behavior of f as x approaches a from the right and from the left.
Similarly, we may investigate limits of two-variable functions, lim(x,y)(a,b) f (x, y)
by considering the behavior of f as (x, y) approaches (a, b) from various direc-
tions. This situation is more complicated because there are infinitely many
ways in which (x, y) may approach (a, b). In the next activity, we see how it is
important to consider a variety of those paths in investigating whether or not
a limit exists.

Activity 10.1.2 Consider the function f , defined by

                  f (x, y) =                             y
                                                                 ,

                                                       x2 + y2

whose graph is shown below in Figure 10.1.10

a. Is f defined at the point (0, 0)? What, if anything, does this say about
    whether f has a limit at the point (0, 0)?

b. Values of f (to three decimal places) at several points close to (0, 0) are
    shown in Table 10.1.11.

  1.000     --
         -0.707     --

    Based on these calculations, state whether f has a limit at (0, 0) and give
    an argument supporting your statement. (Hint: The blank spaces in the
    table are there to help you see the patterns.)

c. Now we formalize the conjecture from the previous part by considering
    what happens if we restrict our attention to different paths. First, we
    look at f for points in the domain along the x-axis; that is, we consider
    what happens when y = 0. What is the behavior of f (x, 0) as x  0? If
    we approach (0, 0) by moving along the x-axis, what value do we find as
    the limit?

d. What is the behavior of f along the line y = x when x > 0; that is, what
    is the value of f (x, x) when x > 0? If we approach (0, 0) by moving along
    the line y = x in the first quadrant (thus considering f (x, x) as x  0+,
    what value do we find as the limit?

e. In general, if lim(x,y)(0,0) f (x, y) = L, then f (x, y) approaches L as (x, y)
    approaches (0, 0), regardless of the path we take in letting (x, y)  (0, 0).
    Explain what the last two parts of this activity imply about the existence
    of lim(x,y)(0,0) f (x, y).

f. Shown below in Figure 10.1.12 is a set of contour lines of the function
    f . What is the behavior of f (x, y) as (x, y) approaches (0, 0) along any
    straight line? How does this observation reinforce your conclusion about
    the existence of lim(x,y)(0,0) f (x, y) from the previous part of this activ-
    ity? (Hint: Use the fact that a non-vertical line has equation y = mx for
    some constant m.)

                                                                  y

                                                                                          x

       Figure 10.1.12 Contour lines of f (x, y) = x2y+y2 .
    As we have seen in Activity 10.1.2, if (x, y) approachs (a, b) along two
different paths and we find that f (x, y) has two different limits, we can conclude
that lim(x,y)(a,b) f (x, y) does not exist. This is similar to the one-variable
example g(x) = x/|x| as shown in Figure 10.1.13; limx0 g(x) does not exist
because we see different limits as x approaches 0 from the left and the right.

    As a general rule, we have

                             Limits along different paths.

    If f (x, y) has two different limits as (x, y) approaches (a, b) along two
    different paths, then lim(x,y)(a,b) f (x, y) does not exist.

    As the next activity shows, studying the limit of a two-variable function f
by considering the behavior of f along various paths can require subtle insights.
Activity 10.1.3 Let's consider the function g defined by

                                                       x2y
                                        g(x, y) = x4 + y2
and investigate the limit lim(x,y)(0,0) g(x, y).
   a. What is the behavior of g on the x-axis? That is, what is g(x, 0) and
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 104

       what is the limit of g as (x, y) approaches (0, 0) along the x-axis?

b. What is the behavior of g on the y-axis? That is, what is g(0, y) and
    what is the limit of g as (x, y) approaches (0, 0) along the y-axis?

c. What is the behavior of g on the line y = mx? That is, what is g(x, mx)
   and what is the limit of g as (x, y) approaches (0, 0) along the line y =
   mx?

d. Based on what you have seen so far, do you think lim(x,y)(0,0) g(x, y)
    exists? If so, what do you think its value is?

e. Now consider the behavior of g on the parabola y = x2? What is g(x, x2)
   and what is the limit of g as (x, y) approaches (0, 0) along this parabola?

    f. State whether the limit lim(x,y)(0,0) g(x, y) exists or not and provide a
       justification of your statement.

    This activity shows that we need to be careful when studying the limit of
a two-variable functions by considering its behavior along different paths. If
we find two different paths that result in two different limits, then we may
conclude that the limit does not exist. However, we can never conclude that
the limit of a function exists only by considering its behavior along different
paths.

    Generally speaking, concluding that a limit lim(x,y)(a,b) f (x, y) exists re-
quires a more careful argument.

Example 10.1.14 Consider the function f defined by

                                                      x2y2
                                       f (x, y) = x2 + y2 .

We want to know whether lim(x,y)(0,0) f (x, y) exists.
    Note that if either x or y is 0, then f (x, y) = 0. Therefore, if f has a limit

at (0, 0), it must be 0. We will therefore argue that

                          lim f (x, y) = 0,

                      (x,y)(0,0)

by showing that we can make f (x, y) as close to 0 as we wish by taking (x, y)

sufficiently close (but not equal) to (0, 0). In what follows, we view x and y as

being real numbers that are close, but not equal, to 0.

Since 0  x2, we have

                      y2  x2 + y2,

which implies that

                         y2
                      x2 + y2  1.

Multiplying both sides by x2 and observing that f (x, y)  0 for all (x, y)

gives

                           x2y2 2      y2                 x2.
       0  f (x, y) = 2 2 = x        x2 + y2

                         x +y

    Thus, 0  f (x, y)  x2. Since x2  0 as x  0, we can make f (x, y) as
close to 0 as we like by taking x sufficiently close to 0 (for this example, it turns
out that we don't even need to worry about making y close to 0). Therefore,

                                     x2y2
                      (x,y)(0,0) lim x2 + y2 = 0.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 105

    In spite of the fact that these two most recent examples illustrate some
of the complications that arise when studying limits of two-variable functions,
many of the properties that are familiar from our study of single variable
functions hold in precisely the same way.

                    Properties of Limits.

Let f = f (x, y) and g = g(x, y) be functions so that lim(x,y)(a,b) f (x, y)
and lim(x,y)(a,b) g(x, y) both exist. Then

1. lim x = a and lim y = b

(x,y)(a,b)             (x,y)(a,b)

2. lim cf (x, y) = c lim f (x, y) for any scalar c

(x,y)(a,b)             (x,y)(a,b)

3. lim [f (x, y) ± g(x, y)] = lim f (x, y) ± lim g(x, y)

(x,y)(a,b)             (x,y)(a,b)          (x,y)(a,b)

4. lim [f (x, y)g(x, y)] = lim f (x, y)        lim g(x, y)

(x,y)(a,b)             (x,y)(a,b)          (x,y)(a,b)

                       lim f (x, y)
            f (x, y) (x,y)(a,b)
5. lim              =                if lim g(x, y) = 0.
(x,y)(a,b) g(x, y)     lim g(x, y)
                                           (x,y)(a,b)

                       (x,y)(a,b)

    We can use these properties and results from single variable calculus to
verify that many limits exist. For example, these properties show that the
function f defined by

                              f (x, y) = 3x2y3 + 2xy2 - 3x + 1

has a limit at every point (a, b) and, moreover,

                                      lim f (x, y) = f (a, b).

                                                (x,y)(a,b)

    The reason for this is that polynomial functions of a single variable have
limits at every point.

10.1.2 Continuity

Recall that a function f of a single variable x is said to be continuous at x = a
provided that the following three conditions are satisfied:

   1. f (a) exists,

   2. limxa f (x) exists, and
   3. limxa f (x) = f (a).
    Using our understanding of limits of multivariable functions, we can define
continuity in the same way.
Definition 10.1.15 A function f = f (x, y) is continuous at the point (a, b)
provided that
   1. f is defined at the point (a, b),

   2. lim(x,y)(a,b) f (x, y) exists, and
   3. lim(x,y)(a,b) f (x, y) = f (a, b).
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 106

                                                                                                     
    For instance, we have seen that the function f defined by f (x, y) = 3x2y3 +
2xy2 - 3x + 1 is continous at every point. And just as with single variable
functions, continuity has certain properties that are based on the properties of
limits.

       Properties of continuity.

Let f and g be functions of two variables that are continuous at the
point (a, b). Then

   1. cf is continuous at (a, b) for any scalar c

2. f + g is continuous at (a, b)

3. f - g is continuous at (a, b)

4. f g is continuous at (a, b)

5.  f  is continuous at (a, b) if g(a, b) = 0
    g

    Using these properties, we can apply results from single variable calculus to
decide about continuity of multivariable functions. For example, the coordinate
functions f and g defined by f (x, y) = x and g(x, y) = y are continuous
at every point. We can then use properties of continuity listed to conclude
that every polynomial function in x and y is continuous at every point. For
example, g(x, y) = x2 and h(x, y) = y3 are continuous functions, so their
product f (x, y) = x2y3 is a continuous multivariable function.

10.1.3 Summary

    · A function f = f (x, y) has a limit L at a point (a, b) provided that we
       can make f (x, y) as close to L as we like by taking (x, y) sufficiently close
       (but not equal) to (a, b).

    · If (x, y) has two different limits as (x, y) approaches (a, b) along two
       different paths, we can conclude that lim(x,y)(a,b) f (x, y) does not exist.

    · Properties similar to those for one-variable functions allow us to conclude
       that many limits exist and to evaluate them.

    · A function f = f (x, y) is continuous at a point (a, b) in its domain if f
       has a limit at (a, b) and

                                     f (a, b) = lim f (x, y).

                                                                       (x,y)(a,b)

2. Determining the limit of a funtion. In this problem we show that

the function                            6x - y
                           f (x, y) =

    (c) Note that the results from (a) and (b) indicate that f has no limit
as (x, y)  (0, 0) (be sure you can explain why!).

    To show this more generally, consider (x, y)  (0, 0) along the curve
y = mx, for arbitrary m. Find the limit in this case:

         lim x+y 6x-y =

      (x,mx)(0,0)

10.2 First-Order Partial Derivatives

Motivating Questions

   · How are the first-order partial derivatives of a function f of the indepen-
       dent variables x and y defined?

· Given a function f of the independent variables x and y, what do the

first-order  partial  derivatives  f  and                         f    tell  us  about  f?
                                   x                              y

    The derivative plays a central role in first semester calculus because it
provides important information about a function. Thinking graphically, for
instance, the derivative at a point tells us the slope of the tangent line to the
graph at that point. In addition, the derivative at a point also provides the
instantaneous rate of change of the function with respect to changes in the
independent variable.

    Now that we are investigating functions of two or more variables, we can
still ask how fast the function is changing, though we have to be careful about
what we mean. Thinking graphically again, we can try to measure how steep
the graph of the function is in a particular direction. Alternatively, we may
want to know how fast a function's output changes in response to a change
in one of the inputs. Over the next few sections, we will develop tools for
addressing issues such as these these. Preview Activity 10.2.1 explores some
issues with what we will come to call partial derivatives.

Preview Activity 10.2.1 Suppose we take out an $18,000 car loan at interest

rate r and we agree to pay off the loan in t years. The monthly payment, in

dollars, is

                      M (r, t) =      1500r
                                                                  r -12t .
                                   1 - 1 + 12

a. What is the monthly payment if the interest rate is 3% so that r = 0.03,
   and we pay the loan off in t = 4 years?

b. Suppose the interest rate is fixed at 3%. Express M as a function f of t
    alone using r = 0.03. That is, let f (t) = M (0.03, t). Sketch the graph of

10.2.1 First-Order Partial Derivatives

In Section 9.1, we studied the behavior of a function of two or more variables
by considering the traces of the function. Recall that in one example, we
considered the function f defined by

                             f (x, y) =  x2 sin(2y)  ,

                                             32

which measures the range, or horizontal distance, in feet, traveled by a projec-
tile launched with an initial speed of x feet per second at an angle y radians
to the horizontal. The graph of this function is given again on the left in
Figure 10.2.2. Moreover, if we fix the angle y = 0.6, we may view the trace
f (x, 0.6) as a function of x alone, as seen at right in Figure 10.2.2.

                             z           1000 f (x, 0.6)

                                                        50 100 150 200

                                                                         x2 sin(2y)

Figure 10.2.2 Left: The trace of z = 32 with y = 0.6.

    Since the trace is a one-variable function, we may consider its derivative
just as we did in the first semester of calculus. With y = 0.6, we have

                       f (x, 0.6) = sin(1.2) x2,
                                         32

and therefore          d                     sin(1.2)

                       dx    [f (x, 0.6)] =      16     x.

   When x = 150, this gives

     d                    sin(1.2)
     dx [f (x, 0.6)]|x=150 = 16 150  8.74 feet per feet per second,

which gives the slope of the tangent line shown on the right of Figure 10.2.2.
Thinking of this derivative as an instantaneous rate of change implies that if
we increase the initial speed of the projectile by one foot per second, we expect
the horizontal distance traveled to increase by approximately 8.74 feet if we
hold the launch angle constant at 0.6 radians.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 112

    By holding y fixed and differentiating with respect to x, we obtain the first-
order partial derivative of f with respect to x. Denoting this partial derivative
as fx, we have seen that

                     d                                  f (150 + h, 0.6) - f (150, 0.6)
fx(150, 0.6) = f (x, 0.6)|x=150 = lim                                                    .
                     dx                           h0                          h

More generally, we have

                     fx(a, b) = lim               f (a + h, b) - f (a, b)  ,

                             h0                         h

provided this limit exists.
    In the same way, we may obtain a trace by setting, say, x = 150 as shown

in Figure 10.2.3.

                             z                    1000 f (150, y)

Figure 10.2.3 The trace of z = 32 with x = 150.

This gives

                            f (150, y) =          1502  sin(2y),

                                                  32

and therefore                                     1502

                         d   [f (150, y)] =             cos(2y).

                         dy                       16

If we evaluate this quantity at y = 0.6, we have

d                            1502
dy [f (150, y)]|y=0.6 = 16 cos(1.2)  509.5 feet per radian.

    Once again, the derivative gives the slope of the tangent line shown on the
right in Figure 10.2.3. Thinking of the derivative as an instantaneous rate of
change, we expect that the range of the projectile increases by 509.5 feet for
every radian we increase the launch angle y if we keep the initial speed of the
projectile constant at 150 feet per second.

    By holding x fixed and differentiating with respect to y, we obtain the first-
order partial derivative of f with respect to y. As before, we denote this partial
derivative as fy and write

                     d                                  f (150, 0.6 + h) - f (150, 0.6)
fy(150, 0.6) = f (150, y)|y=0.6 = lim                                                    .
                     dy                           h0                          h

    As with the partial derivative with respect to x, we may express this quan-
tity more generally at an arbitrary point (a, b). To recap, we have now arrived
at the formal definition of the first-order partial derivatives of a function of
two variables.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 113

Definition 10.2.4 The first-order partial derivatives of f with respect
to x and y at a point (a, b) are, respectively,

fx(a, b) = lim                  f (a + h, b) - f (a, b)  , and

                            h0  h

fy(a, b) = lim                  f (a, b + h) - f (a, b)  ,

                            h0  h

provided the limits exist.                                      

Activity 10.2.2 Consider the function f defined by

                                          xy2
                            f (x, y) =

                                         x+1

at the point (1, 2).

   a. Write the trace f (x, 2) at the fixed value y = 2. On the left side of
       Figure 10.2.5, draw the graph of the trace with y = 2 around the point
       where x = 1, indicating the scale and labels on the axes. Also, sketch
       the tangent line at the point x = 1.

Figure 10.2.5 Traces of f (x, y) = x+1 xy2 .

b. Find the partial derivative fx(1, 2) and relate its value to the sketch you
    just made.

c. Write the trace f (1, y) at the fixed value x = 1. On the right side of
   Figure 10.2.5, draw the graph of the trace with x = 1 indicating the scale
   and labels on the axes. Also, sketch the tangent line at the point y = 2.

   d. Find the partial derivative fy(1, 2) and relate its value to the sketch you
       just made.

    As these examples show, each partial derivative at a point arises as the
derivative of a one-variable function defined by fixing one of the coordinates. In
addition, we may consider each partial derivative as defining a new function of
the point (x, y), just as the derivative f (x) defines a new function of x in single-
variable calculus. Due to the connection between one-variable derivatives and
partial derivatives, we will often use Leibniz-style notation to denote partial
derivatives by writing

f                               f
x (a, b) = fx(a, b), and y (a, b) = fy(a, b).
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 114

    To calculate the partial derivative fx, we hold y fixed and thus we treat y
as a constant. In Leibniz notation, observe that

                                                  
                        (x) = 1 and (y) = 0.
                     x                            x

    To see the contrast between how we calculate single variable derivatives and

partial derivatives, and the difference between the notations dxd [ ] and x [ ],
observe that

d [3x2 - 2x + 3] = 3 d [x2] - 2 d [x] + d [3] = 3 · 2x - 2,
dx                      dx                        dx    dx

and  [x2y - xy + 2y] = y  [x2] - y  [x] +  [2y] = y · 2x - y
x                                              x     x                 x

    Thus, computing partial derivatives is straightforward: we use the standard
rules of single variable calculus, but do so while holding one (or more) of the
variables constant.

10.2.2 Interpretations of First-Order Partial Derivatives

Recall that the derivative of a single variable function has a geometric interpre-
tation as the slope of the line tangent to the graph at a given point. Similarly,
we have seen that the partial derivatives measure the slope of a line tangent
to a trace of a function of two variables as shown in Figure 10.2.6.

Figure 10.2.6 Tangent lines to two traces of the distance function.

    Now we consider the first-order partial derivatives in context. Recall that
the difference quotient h f(a+h)-f(a) for a function f of a single variable x at a
point where x = a tells us the average rate of change of f over the interval

[a, a + h], while the derivative f (a) tells us the instantaneous rate of change
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 115

of f at x = a. We can use these same concepts to explain the meanings of the
partial derivatives in context.

Activity 10.2.4 The speed of sound C traveling through ocean water is a
function of temperature, salinity and depth. It may be modeled by the function

C = 1449.2 + 4.6T - 0.055T 2 + 0.00029T 3 + (1.34 - 0.01T )(S - 35) + 0.016D.

    Here C is the speed of sound in meters/second, T is the temperature in
degrees Celsius, S is the salinity in grams/liter of water, and D is the depth
below the ocean surface in meters.

   a. State the units in which each of the partial derivatives, CT , CS and CD,
       are expressed and explain the physical meaning of each.

   b. Find the partial derivatives CT , CS and CD.

   c. Evaluate each of the three partial derivatives at the point where T = 10,
       S = 35 and D = 100. What does the sign of each partial derivatives tell
       us about the behavior of the function C at the point (10, 35, 100)?

10.2.3 Using tables and contours to estimate partial deriva-
          tives

Remember that functions of two variables are often represented as either a
table of data or a contour plot. In single variable calculus, we saw how we can
use the difference quotient to approximate derivatives if, instead of an algebraic
formula, we only know the value of the function at a few points. The same
idea applies to partial derivatives.

Activity 10.2.5 The wind chill, as frequently reported, is a measure of how
cold it feels outside when the wind is blowing. In Table 10.2.7, the wind chill
w, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, is a function of the wind speed v, measured
in miles per hour, and the ambient air temperature T , also measured in degrees
Fahrenheit. We thus view w as being of the form w = w(v, T ).

       derivative of a single variable function f using the symmetric difference
       quotient 2h f(x+h)-f(x-h) for small values of h. A partial derivative is a
       derivative of an appropriate trace.)

   b. Estimate the partial derivative wT (20, -10). What are the units on this
       quantity and what does it mean?

h. Suppose you have yet another function h, and you know that h(2, 2) = 4,
    hx(2, 2) < 0, and hy(2, 2) > 0. Using this information, sketch a possi-
    ble contour h(x, y) = 4 passing through (2, 2) on the right side of Fig-

10.2.4 Summary

· If f = f (x, y) is a function of two variables, there are two first order
   partial derivatives of f : the partial derivative of f with respect to x,

               f  (x, y) = fx(x, y) = lim     f (x + h, y) - f (x, y)  ,

               x                          h0          h

and the partial derivative of f with respect to y,

               f  (x, y) = fy(x, y) = lim     f (x, y + h) - f (x, y)  ,

               y                          h0          h

where each partial derivative exists only at those points (x, y) for which
the limit exists.

· The partial derivative fx(a, b) tells us the instantaneous rate of change of
   f with respect to x at (x, y) = (a, b) when y is fixed at b. Geometrically,
   the partial derivative fx(a, b) tells us the slope of the line tangent to the
   y = b trace of the function f at the point (a, b, f (a, b)).

· The partial derivative fy(a, b) tells us the instantaneous rate of change of
   f with respect to y at (x, y) = (a, b) when x is fixed at a. Geometrically,
   the partial derivative fy(a, b) tells us the slope of the line tangent to the
   x = a trace of the function f at the point (a, b, f (a, b)).

17. Recall from single variable calculus that, given the derivative of a single
      variable function and an initial condition, we can integrate to find the
      original function. We can sometimes use the same process for functions of
      more than one variable. For example, suppose that a function f satisfies
      fx(x, y) = cos(y)ex +2x+y2, fy(x, y) = - sin(y)ex +2xy+3, and f (0, 0) =
      5.
          a. Find all possible functions f of x and y such that fx(x, y) = cos(y)ex+
              2x + y2. Your function will have both x and y as independent vari-
              ables and may also contain summands that are functions of y alone.

          b. Use the fact that fy(x, y) = - sin(y)ex + 2xy + 3 to determine any
              unknown non-constant summands in your result from part (a).

          c. Complete the problem by determining the specific function f that
              satisfies the given conditions.

10.3 Second-Order Partial Derivatives

Motivating Questions

   · Given a function f of two independent variables x and y, how are the
       second-order partial derivatives of f defined?

· What do the second-order partial derivatives fxx, fyy, fxy, and fyx of a
   function f tell us about the function's behavior?

    Recall that for a single-variable function f , the second derivative of f is

defined to be the derivative of the first derivative. That is, f (x) = ddx [f (x)],
which can be stated in terms of the limit definition of the derivative by writing

f (x) = lim  f (x + h) - f (x)  .

h0           h

    In what follows, we begin exploring the four different second-order partial
derivatives of a function of two variables and seek to understand what these
various derivatives tell us about the function's behavior.

Preview Activity 10.3.1 Once again, let's consider the function f defined

                          x2 sin(2y)

by f (x, y) = 32 that measures a projectile's range as a function of its
initial speed x and launch angle y. The graph of this function, including traces
with x = 150 and y = 0.6, is shown in Figure 10.3.1.

   e. Because fx and fy are each functions of both x and y, they each have
       two partial derivatives. Not only can we compute fxx = (fx)x, but also
       fxy = (fx)y; likewise, in addition to fyy = (fy)y, but also fyx = (fy)x.

                                                                         x2 sin(2y)

       For the range function f (x, y) = 32 , use your earlier computations
       of fx and fy to now determine fxy and fyx. Write one sentence to explain
       how you calculated these "mixed" partial derivatives.

10.3.1 Second-order Partial Derivatives

A function f of two independent variables x and y has two first order partial
derivatives, fx and fy. As we saw in Preview Activity 10.3.1, each of these
first-order partial derivatives has two partial derivatives, giving a total of four
second-order partial derivatives:

   · fxx = (fx)x = x x  f = x2 2f ,

   · fyy = (fy)y = y y  f = y2 2f ,

   · fxy = (fx)y = y x  f = yx 2f ,

   · fyx = (fy)x = x y  f = xy 2f .
    The first two are called unmixed second-order partial derivatives while the
last two are called the mixed second-order partial derivatives.
    One aspect of this notation can be a little confusing. The notation

                                        2f  f
                                               =

                                       yx y x

means that we first differentiate with respect to x and then with respect to y;
this can be expressed in the alternate notation fxy = (fx)y. However, to find
the second partial derivative

                                           fyx = (fy)x
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 127

we first differentiate with respect to y and then x. This means that

                        2f                       2f
                        yx = fxy, and xy = fyx.

    Be sure to note carefully the difference between Leibniz notation and sub-
script notation and the order in which x and y appear in each. In addition,
remember that anytime we compute a partial derivative, we hold constant the
variable(s) other than the one we are differentiating with respect to.

Activity 10.3.2 Find all second order partial derivatives of the following func-
tions. For each partial derivative you calculate, state explicitly which variable
is being held constant.

   a. f (x, y) = x2y3

b. f (x, y) = y cos(x)
c. g(s, t) = st3 + s4

   d. How many second order partial derivatives does the function h defined
       by h(x, y, z) = 9x9z - xyz9 + 9 have? Find hxz and hzx (you do not need
       to find the other second order partial derivatives).

    In Preview Activity 10.3.1 and Activity 10.3.2, you may have noticed that
the mixed second-order partial derivatives are equal. This observation holds
generally and is known as Clairaut's Theorem.

                               Clairaut's Theorem.

Let f be a function of several variables for which the partial derivatives
fxy and fyx are continuous near the point (a, b). Then

                              fxy(a, b) = fyx(a, b).

10.3.2 Interpreting the second-order Partial Derivatives

Recall from single variable calculus that the second derivative measures the
instantaneous rate of change of the derivative. This observation is the key to
understanding the meaning of the second-order partial derivatives.

                        z                             z                             z

                           2                             2                             2

                3                             3                             3

Figure 10.3.4 The tangent lines to a trace with increasing x.

    Furthermore, we remember that the second derivative of a function at a
point provides us with information about the concavity of the function at that
point. Since the unmixed second-order partial derivative fxx requires us to
hold y constant and differentiate twice with respect to x, we may simply view
fxx as the second derivative of a trace of f where y is fixed. As such, fxx will
measure the concavity of this trace.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 128

    Consider, for example, f (x, y) = sin(x)e-y. Figure 10.3.4 shows the graph
of this function along with the trace given by y = -1.5. Also shown are three
tangent lines to this trace, with increasing x-values from left to right among
the three plots in Figure 10.3.4.

    That the slope of the tangent line is decreasing as x increases is reflected,
as it is in one-variable calculus, in the fact that the trace is concave down.
Indeed, we see that fx(x, y) = cos(x)e-y and so fxx(x, y) = - sin(x)e-y < 0,
since e-y > 0 for all values of y, including y = -1.5.

    In the following activity, we further explore what second-order partial
derivatives tell us about the geometric behavior of a surface.

Activity 10.3.3 We continue to consider the function f defined by f (x, y) =
sin(x)e-y .

   a. In Figure 10.3.5, we see the trace of f (x, y) = sin(x)e-y that has x held
       constant with x = 1.75. We also see three different lines that are tangent
       to the trace of f in the x direction at values of y that are increasing
       from left to right in the figure. Write a couple of sentences that describe
       whether the slope of the tangent lines to this curve increase or decrease as
       y increases, and, after computing fyy(x, y), explain how this observation
       is related to the value of fyy(1.75, y). Be sure to address the notion of
       concavity in your response.(You need to be careful about the directions
       in which x and y are increasing.)

Figure 10.3.5 The tangent lines to a trace with increasing y.

b. In Figure 10.3.6, we start to think about the mixed partial derivative,
    fxy. Here, we first hold y constant to generate the first-order partial
    derivative fx, and then we hold x constant to compute fxy. This leads
    to first thinking about a trace with x being constant, followed by slopes
    of tangent lines in the y-direction that slide along the original trace. You
    might think of sliding your pencil down the trace with x constant in a
    way that its slope indicates (fx)y in order to further animate the three
    snapshots shown in the figure.

CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 129

       Based on Figure 10.3.6, is fxy(1.75, -1.5) positive or negative? Why?

   c. Determine the formula for fxy(x, y), and hence evaluate fxy(1.75, -1.5).
       How does this value compare with your observations in (b)?

   d. We know that fxx(1.75, -1.5) measures the concavity of the y = -1.5
       trace, and that fyy(1.75, -1.5) measures the concavity of the x = 1.75
       trace. What do you think the quantity fxy(1.75, -1.5) measures?

   e. On Figure 10.3.6, sketch the trace with y = -1.5, and sketch three tan-
       gent lines whose slopes correspond to the value of fyx(x, -1.5) for three
       different values of x, the middle of which is x = -1.5. Is fyx(1.75, -1.5)
       positive or negative? Why? What does fyx(1.75, -1.5) measure?

    Just as with the first-order partial derivatives, we can approximate second-
order partial derivatives in the situation where we have only partial information
about the function.

Activity 10.3.4 As we saw in Activity 10.2.5, the wind chill w(v, T ), in degrees
Fahrenheit, is a function of the wind speed, in miles per hour, and the air
temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit. Some values of the wind chill are recorded
in Table 10.3.7.

   b. In a similar way, estimate the second-order partial wvv(20, -10).

   c. Estimate the partial derivatives wT (20, -10), wT (25, -10), and wT (15, -10),
       and use your results to estimate the partial wT v(20, -10).

   e. Write several sentences that explain what the values wT T (20, -10), wvv(20, -10),
       and wT v(20, -10) indicate regarding the behavior of w(v, T ).

    As we have found in Activities 10.3.3 and Activity 10.3.4, we may think of
fxy as measuring the "twist" of the graph as we increase y along a particular
trace where x is held constant. In the same way, fyx measures how the graph
twists as we increase x. If we remember that Clairaut's theorem tells us that
fxy = fyx, we see that the amount of twisting is the same in both directions.
This twisting is perhaps more easily seen in Figure 10.3.8, which shows the
graph of f (x, y) = -xy, for which fxy = -1.

10.3.3 Summary

    · There are four second-order partial derivatives of a function f of two
       independent variables x and y:
                   fxx = (fx)x, fxy = (fx)y, fyx = (fy)x, and fyy = (fy)y.

    · The unmixed second-order partial derivatives, fxx and fyy, tell us about
       the concavity of the traces. The mixed second-order partial derivatives,
       fxy and fyx, tell us how the graph of f twists.

10.4 Linearization: Tangent Planes and Differ-
       entials

Motivating Questions

   · What does it mean for a function of two variables to be locally linear at
       a point?

   · How do we find the equation of the plane tangent to a locally linear
       function at a point?

   · What is the differential of a multivariable function of two variables and
       what are its uses?

    One of the central concepts in single variable calculus is that the graph of
a differentiable function, when viewed on a very small scale, looks like a line.
We call this line the tangent line and measure its slope with the derivative. In
this section, we will extend this concept to functions of several variables.

    Let's see what happens when we look at the graph of a two-variable function
on a small scale. To begin, let's consider the function f defined by

                                    f (x, y) = 6 - x2 - y2,
                                                        2

whose graph is shown in Figure 10.4.1.

    We choose to study the behavior of this function near the point (x0, y0) =
(1, 1). In particular, we wish to view the graph on an increasingly small scale
around this point, as shown in the two plots in Figure 10.4.2

    Just as the graph of a differentiable single-variable function looks like a
line when viewed on a small scale, we see that the graph of this particular two-
variable function looks like a plane, as seen in Figure 10.4.3. In the following
preview activity, we explore how to find the equation of this plane.

    In what follows, we will also use the important fact1 that the plane passing
through (x0, y0, z0) may be expressed in the form z = z0 + a(x - x0) + b(y - y0),
where a and b are constants.

   a. Evaluate f (x, y) = 6 - 2x2 - y2 and its partial derivatives at (x0, y0); that
       is, find f (1, 1), fx(1, 1), and fy(1, 1).

b. We know one point on the tangent plane; namely, the z-value of the

   tangent  plane  agrees  with  the   z-value  on   the  graph  of  f  (x,  y)  =  6-   x2  -y2
                                                                                         2

    1As we saw in Section 9.5, the equation of a plane passing through the point (x0, y0, z0)
may be written in the form A(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0. If the plane is not vertical,
then C = 0, and we can rearrange this and hence write C(z - z0) = -A(x - x0) - B(y - y0)
and thus

10.4.1 The tangent plane

Before stating the formula for the equation of the tangent plane at a point for
a general function f = f (x, y), we need to discuss a technical condition. As we
have noted, when we look at the graph of a single-variable function on a small
scale near a point x0, we expect to see a line; in this case, we say that f is
locally linear near x0 since the graph looks like a linear function locally around
x0. Of course, there are functions, such as the absolute value function given
by f (x) = |x|, that are not locally linear at every point. In single-variable
calculus, we learn that if the derivative of a function exists at a point, then the
function is guaranteed to be locally linear there.

    In a similar way, we say that a two-variable function f is locally linear near
(x0, y0) provided that the graph of f looks like a plane (its tangent plane) when
viewed on a small scale near (x0, y0). How can we tell when a function of two
variables is locally linear at a point?

    It is not unreasonable to expect that if fx(a, b) and fy(a, b) exist for some
function f at a point (a, b), then f is locally linear at (a, b). This is not
sufficient, however. As an example, consider the function f defined by f (x, y) =
x1/3y1/3. In Exercise 10.4.5.11 you are asked to show that fx(0, 0) and fy(0, 0)
both exist, but that f is not locally linear at (0, 0) (see Figure 10.4.12). So the
existence of the two first order partial derivatives at a point does not guarantee
local linearity at that point.

    It would take us too far afield to provide a rigorous dicussion of differentia-
bility of functions of more than one variable (see Exercise 10.4.5.15) for a little
more detail, so we will be content to define stronger, but more easily verified,
conditions that ensure local linearity.

                                       Differentiablity.

    If f is a function of the independent variables x and y and both fx
    and fy exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point
    (x0, y0), then f is continuously differentiable at (x0, y0).

    As a consequence, whenever a function z = f (x, y) is continuously differ-
entiable at a point (x0, y0), it follows that the function has a tangent plane at
(x0, y0). Viewed up close, the tangent plane and the function are then virtually
indistinguishable. (We won't formally define differentiability of multivariable
functions here, and for our purposes continuous differentiability is the only
condition we will ever need to use. It is important to note that continuous
differentiability is a stronger condition than differentiability. All of the results
we encounter will apply to differentiable functions, and so also apply to con-
tinuously differentiable functions.) In addition, as in Preview Activity 10.4.1,
we find the following general formula for the tangent plane.

                                     The tangent plane.

    If f (x, y) has continuous first-order partial derivatives, then the equa-
    tion of the plane tangent to the graph of f at the point (x0, y0, f (x0, y0))
    is

          z = f (x0, y0) + fx(x0, y0)(x - x0) + fy(x0, y0)(y - y0). (10.4.1)

    Important Note: As can be seen in Exercise 10.4.5.11, it is possible that
fx(x0, y0) and fy(x0, y0) can exist for a function f , and so the plane z =
f (x0, y0) + fx(x0, y0)(x - x0) + fy(x0, y0)(y - y0) exists even though f is not
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 139

locally linear at (x0, y0) (because the graph of f does not look linear when we
zoom in around the point (x0, y0)). In such a case this plane is not tangent to
the graph. Differentiability for a function of two variables implies the existence
of a tangent plane, but the existence of the two first order partial derivatives
of a function at a point does not imply differentiaility. This is quite different
than what happens in single variable calculus.

    Finally, one important note about the form of the equation for the tangent
plane, z = f (x0, y0) + fx(x0, y0)(x - x0) + fy(x0, y0)(y - y0). Say, for exam-
ple, that we have the particular tangent plane z = 7 - 2(x - 3) + 4(y + 1).
Observe that we can immediately read from this form that fx(3, -1) = -2
and fy(3, -1) = 4; furthermore, fx(3, -1) = -2 is the slope of the trace to
both f and the tangent plane in the x-direction at (-3, 1). In the same way,
fy(3, -1) = 4 is the slope of the trace of both f and the tangent plane in the
y-direction at (3, -1).

Activity 10.4.2

   a. Find the equation of the tangent plane to f (x, y) = 2 + 4x - 3y at the
       point (1, 2). Simplify as much as possible. Does the result surprise you?
       Explain.

   b. Find the equation of the tangent plane to f (x, y) = x2y at the point
       (1, 2).

10.4.2 Linearization

In single variable calculus, an important use of the tangent line is to approx-
imate the value of a differentiable function. Near the point x0, the tangent
line to the graph of f at x0 is close to the graph of f near x0, as shown in
Figure 10.4.6.

   x0                          x0

Figure 10.4.6 The linearization of the single-variable function f (x).

    In this single-variable setting, we let L denote the function whose graph is
the tangent line, and thus

                               L(x) = f (x0) + f (x0)(x - x0)

    Furthermore, observe that f (x)  L(x) near x0. We call L the linearization
of f .

    In the same way, the tangent plane to the graph of a differentiable function
z = f (x, y) at a point (x0, y0) provides a good approximation of f (x, y) near
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 140

(x0, y0). Here, we define the linearization, L, to be the two-variable function
whose graph is the tangent plane, and thus

           L(x, y) = f (x0, y0) + fx(x0, y0)(x - x0) + fy(x0, y0)(y - y0).
    Finally, note that f (x, y)  L(x, y) for points near (x0, y0). This is illus-
trated in Figure 10.4.7.

Activity 10.4.3 In what follows, we find the linearization of several different
functions that are given in algebraic, tabular, or graphical form.

   a. Find the linearization L(x, y) for the function g defined by
                                                            x

                                           g(x, y) = x2 + y2

       at the point (1, 2). Then use the linearization to estimate the value of
       g(0.8, 2.3).

   Use the data to first estimate the appropriate partial derivatives, and
   then find the linearization L(v, T ) at the point (20, -10). Finally, use
   the linearization to estimate w(10, -10), w(20, -12), and w(18, -12).

After estimating appropriate partial derivatives, determine the lineariza-
tion L(x, y) at the point (2, 1), and use it to estimate f (2.2, 1), f (2, 0.8),
and f (2.2, 0.8).

10.4.3 Differentials

As we have seen, the linearization L(x, y) enables us to estimate the value of
f (x, y) for points (x, y) near the base point (x0, y0). Sometimes, however, we
are more interested in the change in f as we move from the base point (x0, y0)
to another point (x, y).

                                          z

                         df f

(x0, y0)         dx = x               y
            x  dy = y    (x, y)

Figure 10.4.10 The differential df approximates the change in f (x, y).

    Figure 10.4.10 illustrates this situation. Suppose we are at the point (x0, y0),
and we know the value f (x0, y0) of f at (x0, y0). If we consider the displace-
ment x, y to a new point (x, y) = (x0 + x, y0 + y), we would like to
know how much the function has changed. We denote this change by f ,
where

                                   f = f (x, y) - f (x0, y0).

    A simple way to estimate the change f is to approximate it by df , which
represents the change in the linearization L(x, y) as we move from (x0, y0) to
(x, y). This gives

f  df = L(x, y) - f (x0, y0)
            = [f (x0, y0) + fx(x0, y0)(x - x0) + fy(x0, y0)(y - y0)] - f (x0, y0)
            = fx(x0, y0)x + fy(x0, y0)y.

    For consistency, we will denote the change in the independent variables as
dx = x and dy = y, and thus

f  df = fx(x0, y0) dx + fy(x0, y0) dy.   (10.4.2)
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 142

Expressed equivalently in Leibniz notation, we have

f  f
df = dx + dy.                                                 (10.4.3)
x  y

    We call the quantities dx, dy, and df differentials, and we think of them
as measuring small changes in the quantities x, y, and f . Equations (10.4.2)
and (10.4.3) express the relationship between these changes. Equation (10.4.3)
resembles an important idea from single-variable calculus: when y depends on
x, it follows in the notation of differentials that

                                                   dy
                                 dy = y dx = dx.

                                                   dx
We will illustrate the use of differentials with an example.

Example 10.4.11 Suppose we have a machine that manufactures rectangles
of width x = 20 cm and height y = 10 cm. However, the machine isn't perfect,
and therefore the width could be off by dx = x = 0.2 cm and the height
could be off by dy = y = 0.4 cm.

    The area of the rectangle is

A(x, y) = xy,

so that the area of a perfectly manufactured rectangle is A(20, 10) = 200 square
centimeters. Since the machine isn't perfect, we would like to know how much
the area of a given manufactured rectangle could differ from the perfect rect-
angle. We will estimate the uncertainty in the area using (10.4.2), and find
that

                       A  dA = Ax(20, 10) dx + Ay(20, 10) dy.

    Since Ax = y and Ay = x, we have

A  dA = 10 dx + 20 dy = 10 · 0.2 + 20 · 0.4 = 10.

    That is, we estimate that the area in our rectangles could be off by as much
as 10 square centimeters.

Activity 10.4.4 The questions in this activity explore the differential in several
different contexts.

   a. Suppose that the elevation of a landscape is given by the function h, where
       we additionally know that h(3, 1) = 4.35, hx(3, 1) = 0.27, and hy(3, 1) =
       -0.19. Assume that x and y are measured in miles in the easterly and
       northerly directions, respectively, from some base point (0, 0). Your GPS
       device says that you are currently at the point (3, 1). However, you
       know that the coordinates are only accurate to within 0.2 units; that is,
       dx = x = 0.2 and dy = y = 0.2. Estimate the uncertainty in your
       elevation using differentials.

   b. The pressure, volume, and temperature of an ideal gas are related by the
       equation
                                       P = P (T, V ) = 8.31T /V,

       where P is measured in kilopascals, V in liters, and T in kelvin. Find
       the pressure when the volume is 12 liters and the temperature is 310 K.
       Use differentials to estimate the change in the pressure when the volume
       increases to 12.3 liters and the temperature decreases to 305 K.

   c. Refer to Table 10.4.8, the table of values of the wind chill w(v, T ), in
       degrees Fahrenheit, as a function of temperature, also in degrees Fahren-
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 143

heit, and wind speed, in miles per hour. Suppose your anemometer says
the wind is blowing at 25 miles per hour and your thermometer shows a
reading of -15 degrees. However, you know your thermometer is only
accurate to within 2 degrees and your anemometer is only accurate to
within 3 miles per hour. What is the wind chill based on your mea-
surements? Estimate the uncertainty in your measurement of the wind
chill.

10.4.4 Summary

   · A function f of two independent variables is locally linear at a point
       (x0, y0) if the graph of f looks like a plane as we zoom in on the graph
       around the point (x0, y0). In this case, the equation of the tangent plane
       is given by

                   z = f (x0, y0) + fx(x0, y0)(x - x0) + fy(x0, y0)(y - y0).

   · The tangent plane L(x, y) = f (x0, y0)+fx(x0, y0)(x-x0)+fy(x0, y0)(y -
       y0), when considered as a function, is called the linearization of a differ-
       entiable function f at (x0, y0) and may be used to estimate values of
       f (x, y); that is, f (x, y)  L(x, y) for points (x, y) near (x0, y0).

   · A function f of two independent variables is differentiable at (x0, y0)
       provided that both fx and fy exist and are continuous in an open disk
       containing the point (x0, y0).

   · The differential df of a function f = f (x, y) is related to the differentials
       dx and dy by
                                 df = fx(x0, y0)dx + fy(x0, y0)dy.

       We can use this relationship to approximate small changes in f that
       result from small changes in x and y.

10. Let f be the function defined by f (x, y) = 2x2 + 3y3.

          a. Find the equation of the tangent plane to f at the point (1, 2).

          b. Use the linearization to approximate the values of f at the points
              (1.1, 2.05) and (1.3, 2.2).

          c. Compare the approximations form part (b) to the exact values of
              f (1.1, 2.05) and f (1.3, 2.2). Which approximation is more accurate.
              Explain why this should be expected.

11. Let f be the function defined by f (x, y) = x1/3y1/3, whose graph is shown
      in Figure 10.4.12.

              -1                                      1

                                -1
                                                      0

                                                      -1
                                    0y1

Figure 10.4.12 The surface for f (x, y) = x1/3y1/3.

a. Determine       f (0 + h, 0) - f (0, 0)

              lim                   h         .
              h0

What does this limit tell us about fx(0, 0)?

b. Note that f (x, y) = f (y, x), and this symmetry implies that fx(0, 0) =
    fy(0, 0). So both partial derivatives of f exist at (0, 0). A picture of
    the surface defined by f near (0, 0) is shown in Figure 10.4.12. Based
    on this picture, do you think f is locally linear at (0, 0)? Why?

c. Show that the curve where x = y on the surface defined by f is not
   differentiable at 0. What does this tell us about the local linearity
   of f at (0, 0)?

          d. Is the function f defined by f (x, y) = y2+1 x2 locally linear at (0, 0)?
              Why or why not?

12. Let g be a function that is differentiable at (-2, 5) and suppose that its
      tangent plane at this point is given by z = -7 + 4(x + 2) - 3(y - 5).

          a. Determine the values of g(-2, 5), gx(-2, 5), and gy(-2, 5). Write
              one sentence to explain your thinking.

b. Estimate the value of g(-1.8, 4.7). Clearly show your work and
    thinking.

c. Given changes of dx = -0.34 and dy = 0.21, estimate the corre-
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 147

sponding change in g that is given by its differential, dg.

          d. Suppose that another function h is also differentiable at (-2, 5),
              but that its tangent plane at (-2, 5) is given by 3x + 2y - 4z = 9.
              Determine the values of h(-2, 5), hx(-2, 5), and hy(-2, 5), and then
              estimate the value of h(-1.8, 4.7). Clearly show your work and
              thinking.

13. In the following questions, we determine and apply the linearization for
      several different functions.

          a. Find the linearization L(x, y) for the function f defined by f (x, y) =
              cos(x)(2e2y + e-2y) at the point (x0, y0) = (0, 0). Use the lineariza-
              tion to estimate the value of f (0.1, 0.2). Compare your estimate to
              the actual value of f (0.1, 0.2).

b. The Heat Index, I, (measured in apparent degrees F) is a function
    of the actual temperature T outside (in degrees F) and the relative
    humidity H (measured as a percentage). A portion of the table
    which gives values for this function, I = I(T, H), is provided in
    Table 10.4.13.

   Table 10.4.13 Heat index.

96  125 130 135 141

              Suppose you are given that IT (94, 75) = 3.75 and IH (94, 75) = 0.9.
              Use this given information and one other value from the table to es-
              timate the value of I(93.1, 77) using the linearization at (94, 75). Us-
              ing proper terminology and notation, explain your work and think-
              ing.

          c. Just as we can find a local linearization for a differentiable function
              of two variables, we can do so for functions of three or more variables.
              By extending the concept of the local linearization from two to three
              variables, find the linearization of the function h(x, y, z) = e2x(y +
              z2) at the point (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 1, -2). Then, use the linearization
              to estimate the value of h(-0.1, 0.9, -1.8).

14. In the following questions, we investigate two different applied settings
      using the differential.

          a. Let f represent the vertical displacement in centimeters from the rest
              position of a string (like a guitar string) as a function of the distance
              x in centimeters from the fixed left end of the string and y the time
              in seconds after the string has been plucked. (An interesting video of
              this can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKF6nFzpHBUA.)
              A simple model for f could be

f (x, y) = cos(x) sin(2y).

Use the differential to approximate how much more this vibrating

string is vertically displaced from its position at (a, b) = 4 , 3 if

we decrease a by 0.01 cm and increase the time by 0.1 seconds.

Compare to the value of f at the point     - 0.01,     + 0.1  .

          b. Resistors used in electrical circuits have colored bands painted on
              them to indicate the amount of resistance and the possible error in
              the resistance. When three resistors, whose resistances are R1, R2,
              and R3, are connected in parallel, the total resistance R is given by

                                             11 1 1
                                                = + +.

                                            R R1 R2 R3

              Suppose that the resistances are R1 = 25, R2 = 40, and R3 =
              50. Find the total resistance R. If you know each of R1, R2, and
              R3 with a possible error of 0.5%, estimate the maximum error in
              your calculation of R.

15. In this section we argued that if f = f (x, y) is a function of two variables
      and if fx and fy both exist and are continuous in an open disk contain-
      ing the point (x0, y0), then f is differentiable at (x0, y0). This condition
      ensures that f is differentiable at (x0, y0), but it does not define what it
      means for f to be differentiable at (x0, y0). In this exercise we explore the
      definition of differentiability of a function of two variables in more detail.
      Throughout, let g be the function defined by g(x, y) = |xy|.

          a. Use appropriate technology to plot the graph of g on the domain
              [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]. Explain why g is not locally linear at (0, 0).

b. Show that both gx(0, 0) and gy(0, 0) exist. If g is locally linear at
    (0, 0), what must be the equation of the tangent plane L to g at
    (0, 0)?

c. Recall that if a function f = f (x) of a single variable is differentiable
   at x = x0, then

f (x0) = lim f (x0 + h) - f (x0)
h0  h

exists. We saw in single variable calculus that the existence of f (x0)
means that the graph of f is locally linear at x = x0. In other
words, the graph of f looks like its linearization L(x) = f (x0) +
f (x0)(x - x0) for x close to x0. That is, the values of f (x) can be
closely approximated by L(x) as long as x is close to x0. We can
measure how good the approximation of L(x) is to f (x) with the

error function

E(x) = L(x) - f (x) = f (x0) + f (x0)(x - x0) - f (x).

As x approaches x0, E(x) approaches f (x0) + f (x0)(0) - f (x0) = 0,
and so L(x) provides increasingly better approximations to f (x) as
x gets closer to x0. Show that, even though g(x, y) = |xy| is not
locally linear at (0, 0), its error term

E(x, y) = L(x, y) - g(x, y)

    at (0, 0) has a limit of 0 as (x, y) approaches (0, 0). (Use the lin-
    earization you found in part (b).) This shows that just because an
    error term goes to 0 as (x, y) approaches (x0, y0), we cannot conclude
    that a function is locally linear at (x0, y0).

d. As the previous part illustrates, having the error term go to 0 does
    not ensure that a function of two variables is locally linear. Instead,
    we need a notation of a relative error. To see how this works, let
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 149

us return to the single variable case for a moment and consider
f = f (x) as a function of one variable. If we let x = x0 + h,
where |h| is the distance from x to x0, then the relative error in
approximating f (x0 + h) with L(x0 + h) is

                                     E(x0 + h) .
                                           h

Show that, for a function f = f (x) of a single variable, the limit of
the relative error is 0 as h approaches 0.

e. Even though the error term for a function of two variables might
   have a limit of 0 at a point, our example shows that the function
   may not be locally linear at that point. So we use the concept of
   relative error to define differentiability of a function of two variables.
   When we consider differentiability of a function f = f (x, y) at a
   point (x0, y0), thenif x = x0 + h and y = y0 + k, the distance from
   (x, y) to (x0, y0) is h2 + k2.

   Definition 10.4.14 A function f = f (x, y) is differentiable at a
   point (x0, y0) if there is a linear function L = L(x, y) = f (x0, y0) +
   m(x - x0) + n(y - y0) such that the relative error

E(x0 + h, y0 + k)
                                        ,
                               h2 + k2

has at limit of 0 at (h, k) = (0, 0), where E(x, y) = f (x, y) - L(x, y),

h = x - x0, and k = y - y0.                

A function f is differentiable if it is differentiable at every point in
its domain. The function L in the definition is the linearization of f
at (x0, y0). Verify that g(x, y) = |xy| is not differentiable at (0, 0)
by showing that the relative error at (0, 0) does not have a limit at
(0, 0). Conclude that the existence of partial derivatives at a point is
not enough to ensure differentiability at that point. (Hint: Consider
the limit along different paths.)

16. Suppose that a function f = f (x, y) is differentiable at a point (x0, y0).
      Let L = L(x, y) = f (x0, y0) + m(x - x0) + n(y - y0) as in the conditions of
      Definition 10.4.14. Show that m = fx(x0, y0) and n = fy(x0, y0). (Hint:
      Calculate the limits of the relative errors when h = 0 and k = 0.)

17. We know that if a function of a single variable is differentiable at a point,
      then that function is also continuous at that point. In this exercise we
      determine that the same property holds for functions of two variables. A
      function f of the two variables x and y is continuous at a point (x0, y0)
      in its domain if
                                        lim f (x, y) = f (x0, y0)

                                                  (x,y )(x0 ,y0 )

or (letting x = x0 + h and y = y0 + k,

    lim f (x0 + h, y + k) = f (x0, y0).

(h,k)(0,0)

Show that if f is differentiable at (x0, y0), then f is continuous at (x0, y0).
(Hint: Multiply both sides of the equality that comes from differentiability
by lim(h,k)(0,0) h2 + k2.)

10.5 The Chain Rule

Motivating Questions

   · What is the Chain Rule and how do we use it to find a derivative?

· How can we use a tree diagram to guide us in applying the Chain Rule?

   In single-variable calculus, we encountered situations in which some quan-

tity z depends on y and, in turn, y depends on x. A change in x produces a

change in y, which consequently produces a change in z. Using the language

of differentials that we saw in the previous section, these changes are naturally

related by

                  dz               dy
               dz = dy and dy = dx.
                  dy               dx

   In terms of instantaneous rates of change, we then have

               dz =   dz dy     dz
                             dx = dx
                      dy dx     dx

and thus              dz dz dy

                      =         .
                      dx dy dx

    This most recent equation we call the Chain Rule.
    In the case of a function f of two variables where z = f (x, y), it might be
that both x and y depend on another variable t. A change in t then produces
changes in both x and y, which then cause z to change. In this section we
will see how to find the change in z that is caused by a change in t, leading us
to multivariable versions of the Chain Rule involving both regular and partial
derivatives.

Preview Activity 10.5.1 Suppose you are driving around in the xy-plane in
such a way that your position r(t) at time t is given by function

               r(t) = x(t), y(t) = 2 - t2, t3 + 1 .

   The path taken is shown on the left of Figure 10.5.1.

Figure 10.5.1 Left: Your position in the plane. Right: The corresponding
temperature.

    Suppose, furthermore, that the temperature at a point in the plane is given
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 151

by
                                  T (x, y) = 10 - 1 x2 - 1 y2,
                                                      25

and note that the surface generated by T is shown on the right of Figure 10.5.1.
Therefore, as time passes, your position (x(t), y(t)) changes, and, as your po-
sition changes, the temperature T (x, y) also changes.

   a. The position function r provides a parameterization x = x(t) and y = y(t)
       of the position at time t. By substituting x(t) for x and y(t) for y in the
       formula for T , we can write T = T (x(t), y(t)) as a function of t. Make
       these substitutions to write T as a function of t and then use the Chain
       Rule from single variable calculus to find dt dT . (Do not do any algebra to
       simplify the derivative, either before taking the derivative, nor after.)

   b. Now we want to understand how the result from part (a) can be obtained
       from T as a multivariable function. Recall from the previous section that
       small changes in x and y produce a change in T that is approximated by

T  Txx + Tyy.

The Chain Rule tells us about the instantaneous rate of change of T , and
this can be found as

lim T = lim Txx + Tyy .  (10.5.1)
t0 t t0       t

Use equation (10.5.1) to explain why the instantaneous rate of change of
T that results from a change in t is

dT T dx T dy             (10.5.2)
   =     +       .
dt x dt y dt

c. Using the original formulas for T , x, and y in the problem statement,
    calculate all of the derivatives in Equation (10.5.2) (with Tx and Ty in
    terms of x and y, and x and y in terms of t), and hence write the
    right-hand side of Equation (10.5.2) in terms of x, y, and t.

d. Compare the results of parts (a) and (c). Write a couple of sentences that
    identify specifically how each term in (c) relates to a corresponding terms
    in (a). This connection between parts (a) and (c) provides a multivariable
    version of the Chain Rule.

10.5.1 The Chain Rule

As Preview Activity 10.3.1 suggests, the following version of the Chain Rule
holds in general.

                                  The Chain Rule.

Let z = f (x, y), where f is a differentiable function of the independent
variables x and y, and let x and y each be differentiable functions of an
independent variable t. Then

dz z dx z dy
=     +       .          (10.5.3)
dt x dt y dt

It is important to note the differences among the derivatives in (10.5.3).
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 152

Since z is a function of the two variables x and y, the derivatives in the Chain
Rule for z with respect to x and y are partial derivatives. However, since
x = x(t) and y = y(t) are functions of the single variable t, their derivatives
are the standard derivatives of functions of one variable. When we compose z
with x(t) and y(t), we then have z as a function of the single variable t, making
the derivative of z with respect to t a standard derivative from single variable
calculus as well.

    To understand why this Chain Rule works in general, suppose that some
quantity z depends on x and y so that

                           z       z
                     dz = dx + dy.                                   (10.5.4)
                           x       y

Next, suppose that x and y each depend on another quantity t, so that

                     dx                       dy
               dx = dt and dy = dt.                                  (10.5.5)
                     dt                       dt

Combining Equations (10.5.4) and (10.5.5), we find that

                     z dx  dt +    z dy           dz
               dz =                      dt = dt,
                     x dt          y dt           dt

which is the Chain Rule in this particular context, as expressed in Equa-
tion (10.5.3).

Activity 10.5.2 In the following questions, we apply the Chain Rule in several
different contexts.

   a. Suppose that we have a function z defined by z(x, y) = x2 + xy3. In
       addition, suppose that x and y are restricted to points that move around
       the plane by following a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin that is
       parameterized by

               x(t) = 2 cos(t), and y(t) = 2 sin(t).

i. Use the Chain Rule to find the resulting instantaneous rate of change
   dt dz .

ii. Substitute x(t) for x and y(t) for y in the rule for z to write z in

terms   of  t  and  calculate  dz  directly.  Compare  to  the  result  of  part
                               dt

(i.).

b. Suppose that the temperature on a metal plate is given by the function

T with

                     T (x, y) = 100 - (x2 + 4y2),

where the temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and x and y
are each measured in feet.

i. Find Tx and Ty. What are the units on these partial derivatives?

ii. Suppose an ant is walking along the x-axis at the rate of 2 feet per
    minute toward the origin. When the ant is at the point (2, 0), what
    is the instantaneous rate of change in the temperature dT /dt that
    the ant experiences. Include units on your response.

10.5.2 Tree Diagrams

Up to this point, we have applied the Chain Rule to situations where we have
a function z of variables x and y, with both x and y depending on another
single quantity t. We may apply the Chain Rule, however, when x and y each
depend on more than one quantity, or when z is a function of more than two
variables. It can be challenging to keep track of all the dependencies among
the variables, and thus a tree diagram can be a useful tool to organize our
work. For example, suppose that z depends on x and y, and x and y both
depend on t. We may represent these relationships using the tree diagram
shown at left Figure 10.5.3. We place the dependent variable at the top of the
tree and connect it to the variables on which it depends one level below. We
then connect each of those variables to the variable on which each depends.

appropriate derivative or partial derivative, as seen at right in Figure 10.5.3.

To calculate an overall derivative according to the Chain Rule, we construct

the product of the derivatives along all paths connecting the variables and then

add all of these products. For example, the diagram at right in Figure 10.5.3

illustrates the Chain Rule

10.5.3 Summary

· The Chain Rule is a tool for differentiating a composite for functions. In
   its simplest form, it says that if f (x, y) is a function of two variables and
   x(t) and y(t) depend on t, then

                               df f dx f dy
                                  =     +      .
                               dt x dt y dt

· A tree diagram can be used to represent the dependence of variables on
   other variables. By following the links in the tree diagram, we can form
   chains of partial derivatives or derivatives that can be combined to give
   a desired partial derivative.

15. There are several proposed formulas to approximate the surface area of
      the human body. One model1 uses the formula

                                   A(h, w) = 0.0072h0.725w0.425,

      where A is the surface area in square meters, h is the height in centimeters,
      and w is the weight in kilograms.

           Since a person's height h and weight w change over time, h and w are
      functions of time t. Let us think about what is happening to a child whose
      height is 60 centimeters and weight is 9 kilograms. Suppose, furthermore,
      that h is increasing at an instantaneous rate of 20 centimeters per year
      and w is increasing at an instantaneous rate of 5 kg per year.

      changing at this point in time.

16. Let z = f (x, y) = 50 - (x + 1)2 - (y + 3)2 and z = h(x, y) = 24 - 2x - 6y.

      that she walks the curve which is the intersection of f and h.

a. Show that x(t) = 4 cos(t) and y(t) = 4 sin(t) is a parameterization
   of the "shadow" in the xy-plane of the curve that is the intersection
   of the graphs of f and h.

    rate at which her height is changing with respect to time at the
    instant t = 2/3.

then given by

10.6 Directional Derivatives and the Gradient

Motivating Questions

   · The partial derivatives of a function f tell us the rate of change of f in
       the direction of the coordinate axes. How can we measure the rate of
       change of f in other directions?

   · What is the gradient of a function and what does it tell us?

    The partial derivatives of a function tell us the instantaneous rate at which
the function changes as we hold all but one independent variable constant and
allow the remaining independent variable to change. It is natural to wonder
how we can measure the rate at which a function changes in directions other
than parallel to a coordinate axes. In what follows, we investigate this question,
and see how the rate of change in any given direction is connected to the rates
of change given by the standard partial derivatives.

Preview Activity 10.6.1 Let's consider the function f defined by

                                   f (x, y) = 30 - x2 - 1 y2,
                                                              2

and suppose that f measures the temperature, in degrees Celsius, at a given
point in the plane, where x and y are measured in feet. Assume that the
positive x-axis points due east, while the positive y-axis points due north. A
contour plot of f is shown in Figure 10.6.1

a. Suppose that a person is walking due east, and thus parallel to the x-axis.
   At what instantaneous rate is the temperature changing with respect to
   x at the moment the walker passes the point (2, 1)? What are the units
   on this rate of change?

b. Next, determine the instantaneous rate of change of temperature with
    respect to distance at the point (2, 1) if the person is instead walking due
    north. Again, include units on your result.

c. Now, rather than walking due east or due north, let's suppose that the
   person is walking with velocity given by the vector v = 3, 4 , where time
   is measured in seconds. Note that the person's speed is thus |v| = 5 feet
   per second. Find parametric equations for the person's path; that is,
   parameterize the line through (2, 1) using the direction vector v = 3, 4 .
   Let x(t) denote the x-coordinate of the line, and y(t) its y-coordinate.
   Make sure your parameterization places the walker at the point (2, 1)
   when t = 0.

d. With the parameterization in (c), we can now view the temperature f

as not only a function of x and y, but also of time, t. Hence, use the

chain  rule  to  determine  the  value  of  df  t=0. What are the units on your
                                            dt

answer? What is the practical meaning of this result?

10.6.1 Directional Derivatives

Given a function z = f (x, y), the partial derivative fx(x0, y0) measures the
instantaneous rate of change of f as only the x variable changes; likewise,
fy(x0, y0) measures the rate of change of f at (x0, y0) as only y changes. Note
particularly that fx(x0, y0) is measured in "units of f per unit of change in x,"
and that the units on fy(x0, y0) are similar.

    In Preview Activity 10.6.1, we saw how we could measure the rate of change
of f in a situation where both x and y were changing; in that activity, however,
we found that this rate of change was measured in "units of f per unit of time."
In a given unit of time, we may move more than one unit of distance. In fact,
in Preview Activity 10.6.1, in each unit increase in time we move a distance of
|v| = 5 feet. To generalize the notion of partial derivatives to any direction of
our choice, we instead want to have a rate of change whose units are "units of
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 161

f per unit of distance in the given direction."

    In this light, in order to formally define the derivative in a particular direc-

tion of motion, we want to represent the change in f for a given unit change in

the direction of motion. We can represent this unit change in direction with a

unit vector, say u = u1, u2 . If we move a distance h in the direction of u from

a fixed point (x0, y0), we then arrive at the new point (x0 + u1h, y0 + u2h). It

now follows that the slope of the secant line to the curve on the surface through

(x0, y0) in the direction of u through the points (x0, y0) and (x0 +u1h, y0 +u2h)

is                     msec = f (x0 + u1h, y0 + u2h) - f (x0, y0) .

                                             h                                   (10.6.1)

    To get the instantaneous rate of change of f in the direction u = u1, u2 ,
we must take the limit of the quantity in Equation (10.6.1) as h  0. Doing
so results in the formal definition of the directional derivative.

Definition 10.6.2 Let f = f (x, y) be given. The derivative of f at the
point (x, y) in the direction of the unit vector u = u1, u2 is denoted
Duf (x, y) and is given by

    Duf (x, y) = lim f (x + u1h, y + u2h) - f (x, y)                             (10.6.2)
                           h0                        h

for those values of x and y for which the limit exists.                          

    The quantity Duf (x, y) is called a directional derivative. When we evaluate

the directional derivative Duf (x, y) at a point (x0, y0), the result Duf (x0, y0)

tells us the instantaneous rate at which f changes at (x0, y0) per unit increase

in the direction of the vector u. In addition, the quantity Duf (x0, y0) tells us

the slope of the line tangent to the surface in the direction of u at the point

(x0, y0, f (x0, y0)).

10.6.2 Computing the Directional Derivative

In a similar way to how we developed shortcut rules for standard derivatives
in single variable calculus, and for partial derivatives in multivariable calculus,
we can also find a way to evaluate directional derivatives without resorting to
the limit definition found in Equation (10.6.2). We do so using a very similar
approach to our work in Preview Activity 10.6.1.

    Suppose we consider the situation where we are interested in the instanta-
neous rate of change of f at a point (x0, y0) in the direction u = u1, u2 , where
u is a unit vector. The variables x and y are therefore changing according to
the parameterization

                       x = x0 + u1t and y = y0 + u2t.

    Observe that       dx  = u1 and  dy  = u2 for all values of t.    Since u is a unit
                       dt            dt

vector, it follows that a point moving along this line moves one unit of distance

per one unit of time; that is, each single unit of time corresponds to movement

of a single unit of distance in that direction. This observation allows us to

use the Chain Rule to calculate the directional derivative, which measures the

instantaneous rate of change of f with respect to change in the direction u.

    In particular, by the Chain Rule, it follows that

    Duf (x0, y0) = fx(x0, y0)            dx          +fy(x0, y0)  dy

                                         dt (x0,y0)               dt  (x0 ,y0 )

                           = fx(x0, y0)u1 + fy(x0, y0)u2.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 162

    This now allows us to compute the directional derivative at an arbitrary
point according to the following formula.

          Calculating a directional derivative.

Given a differentiable function f = f (x, y) and a unit vector u =
 u1, u2 , we may compute Duf (x, y) by

          Duf (x, y) = fx(x, y)u1 + fy(x, y)u2.         (10.6.3)

    Note well: To use Equation (10.6.3), we must have a unit vector u =
 u1, u2 in the direction of motion. In the event that we have a direction
prescribed by a non-unit vector, we must first scale the vector to have length
1.

Activity 10.6.2 Let f (x, y) = 3xy - x2y3.

   a. Determine fx(x, y) and fy(x, y).

   b. Use Equation (10.6.3) to determine Dif (x, y) and Djf (x, y). What fa-
       miliar function is Dif ? What familiar function is Djf ? (Recall that i is
       the unit vector in the positive x-direction and j is the unit vector in the
       positive y-direction.)

   c. Use Equation (10.6.3) to find the derivative of f in the direction of the
       vector v = 2, 3 at the point (1, -1). Remember that a unit direction
       vector is needed.

10.6.3 The Gradient

Via the Chain Rule, we have seen that for a given function f = f (x, y), its

instantaneous rate of change in the direction of a unit vector u = u1, u2 is

given by

          Duf (x0, y0) = fx(x0, y0)u1 + fy(x0, y0)u2.   (10.6.4)

    Recalling that the dot product of two vectors v = v1, v2 and u = u1, u2
is computed by

                                      v · u = v1u1 + v2u2,

we see that we may recast Equation (10.6.4) in a way that has geometric
meaning. In particular, we see that Duf (x0, y0) is the dot product of the
vector fx(x0, y0), fy(x0, y0) and the vector u.

    We call this vector formed by the partial derivatives of f the gradient of f
and denote it

                           f (x0, y0) = fx(x0, y0), fy(x0, y0) .

    We read f as "the gradient of f ," "grad f " or "del f ".1 Notice that f
varies from point to point, and also provides an alternate formulation of the
directional derivative.

          The directional derivative and the gradient.

Given a differentiable function f = f (x, y) and a unit vector u =
 u1, u2 , we may compute Duf (x, y) by

          Duf (x, y) = f (x, y) · u.                    (10.6.5)

    1The symbol  is called nabla, which comes from a Greek word for a certain type of harp
that has a similar shape.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 163

    In the following activity, we investigate some of what the gradient tells us
about the behavior of a function f .

Activity 10.6.3 Let's consider the function f defined by f (x, y) = x2 - y2.
Some contours for this function are shown in Figure 10.6.3.

   a. Find the gradient f (x, y).

   b. For each of the following points (x0, y0), evaluate the gradient f (x0, y0)
       and sketch the gradient vector with its tail at (x0, y0). Some of the vectors
       are too long to fit onto the plot, but we'd like to draw them to scale; to
       do so, scale each vector by a factor of 1/4.

          · (x0, y0) = (2, 0)
          · (x0, y0) = (0, 2)
          · (x0, y0) = (2, 2)
          · (x0, y0) = (2, 1)
          · (x0, y0) = (-3, 2)
          · (x0, y0) = (-2, -4)
          · (x0, y0) = (0, 0)

   c. What do you notice about the relationship between the gradient at
       (x0, y0) and the contour passing through that point?

   d. Does f increase or decrease in the direction of f (x0, y0)? Provide a
       justification for your response.

    As a vector, f (x0, y0) defines a direction and a length. As we will soon
see, both of these convey important information about the behavior of f near
(x0, y0).

10.6.4 The Direction of the Gradient

Remember that the dot product also conveys information about the angle
between the two vectors. If  is the angle between f (x0, y0) and u (where u
is a unit vector), then we also have that

                Duf (x0, y0) = f (x0, y0) · u = |f (x0, y0)||u| cos().
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 164

    In particular, when  is a right angle, as shown on the left of Figure 10.6.4,
then Duf (x0, y0) = 0, because cos() = 0. Since the value of the directional
derivative is 0, this means that f is unchanging in this direction, and hence
u must be tangent to the contour of f that passes through (x0, y0). In other
words, f (x0, y0) is orthogonal to the contour through (x0, y0). This shows
that the gradient vector at a given point is always perpendicular to the con-
tour passing through the point, confirming that what we saw in part (c) of
Activity 10.6.3 holds in general.

y  f (x0, y0)                  y  f (x0, y0)                y     f (x0, y0)

   u                              u                               
             (x0, y0)                   
                            x                                  u    (x0, y0)
                                          (x0, y0)
                                                         x                    x

Figure 10.6.4 The sign of Duf (x0, y0) is determined by .

    Moreover, when  is an acute angle, it follows that cos() > 0 so since

                           Duf (x0, y0) = |f (x0, y0)||u| cos(),

and therefore Duf (x0, y0) > 0, as shown in the middle image in Figure 10.6.4.
This means that f is increasing in any direction where  is acute. In a similar
way, when  is an obtuse angle, then cos() < 0 so Duf (x0, y0) < 0, as seen
on the right in Figure 10.6.4. This means that f is decreasing in any direction
for which  is obtuse.

    Finally, as we can see in the following activity, we may also use the gradient
to determine the directions in which the function is increasing and decreasing
most rapidly.

Activity 10.6.4 In this activity we investigate how the gradient is related
to the directions of greatest increase and decrease of a function. Let f be a
differentiable function and u a unit vector.

   a. Let  be the angle between f (x0, y0) and u. Use the relationship be-
       tween the dot product and the angle between two vectors to explain why

   Duf (x0, y0) = | fx(x0, y0), fy(x0, y0) | cos().                 (10.6.6)

b. At the point (x0, y0), the only quantity in Equation (10.6.6) that can
    change is  (which determines the direction u of travel). Explain why
     = 0 makes the quantity

                                | fx(x0, y0), fy(x0, y0) | cos()

    as large as possible.

c. When  = 0, in what direction does the unit vector u point relative to
    f (x0, y0)? Why? What does this tell us about the direction of greatest
    increase of f at the point (x0, y0)?

d. In what direction, relative to f (x0, y0), does f decrease most rapidly
    at the point (x0, y0)?

e. State the unit vectors u and v (in terms of f (x0, y0)) that provide the
    directions of greatest increase and decrease for the function f at the point
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 165

    (x0, y0). What important assumption must we make regarding f (x0, y0)
    in order for these vectors to exist?

10.6.5 The Length of the Gradient

Having established in Activity 10.6.4 that the direction in which a function

increases most rapidly at a point (x0, y0) is the unit vector u in the direction

of  the  gradient,  (that   is,  u  =  |f    1  ,y0  )|  f  (x0  ,  y0  ),  provided           that        f (x0, y0)          =
                                           (x0

0), it is also natural to ask, "in the direction of greatest increase for f at

(x0, y0), what is the value of the rate of increase?" In this situation, we are

asking   for  the  value    of  Duf (x0, y0)    where       u  =    |f        1  ,y0  )|  f    (x0      ,  y0  ).
                                                                            (x0

    Using the now familiar way to compute the directional derivative, we see

that
                                                             1

               Duf (x0, y0) = f (x0, y0) · |f (x0, y0)| f (x0, y0) .

    Next, we recall two important facts about the dot product: (i) w · (cv) =
c(w · v) for any scalar c, and (ii) w · w = |w|2. Applying these properties to

the most recent equation involving the directional derivative, we find that

Duf (x0, y0) =              1                                                                  1 |f (x0, y0)|2.
                                    (f (x0, y0)·f (x0, y0)) =                    |f (x0, y0)|
                   |f (x0, y0)|

    Finally, since f (x0, y0) is a nonzero vector, its length |f (x0, y0)| is a
nonzero scalar, and thus we can simplify the preceding equation to establish
that

                                 Duf (x0, y0) = |f (x0, y0)|.

    We summarize our most recent work by stating two important facts about
the gradient.

                       Important facts about the gradient.

    Let f be a differentiable function and (x0, y0) a point for which f (x0, y0) =

    0. Then f (x0, y0) points in the direction of greatest increase of f at

    (x0, y0), and the instantaneous rate of change of f in that direction is

    the  length    of  the  gradient   vector.       That   is,     if  u   =    |f         1  ,y0  )|  f      (x0  ,  y0  ),
                                                                                          (x0

    then u is a unit vector in the direction of greatest increase of f at

    (x0, y0), and Duf (x0, y0) = |f (x0, y0)|.

    Dwf (1, 2).

h. Suppose you are standing at the point (3, 3). In which direction should

    does f increase in this direction?

10.6.6 Applications

The gradient finds many natural applications. For example, situations often
arise -- for instance, constructing a road through the mountains or planning
the flow of water across a landscape -- where we are interested in knowing the
direction in which a function is increasing or decreasing most rapidly.

    For example, consider a two-dimensional version of how a heat-seeking mis-
sile might work.(This application is borrowed from United States Air Force
Academy Department of Mathematical Sciences.) Suppose that the tempera-
ture surrounding a fighter jet can be modeled by the function T defined by

                                                       100
                           T (x, y) = 1 + (x - 5)2 + 4(y - 2.5)2 ,

where (x, y) is a point in the plane of the fighter jet and T (x, y) is measured
in degrees Celsius. Some contours and gradients T are shown on the left in

    A heat-seeking missile will always travel in the direction in which the tem-
perature increases most rapidly; that is, it will always travel in the direction
of the gradient T . If a missile is fired from the point (2, 4), then its path will
be that shown on the right in Figure 10.6.6.

    In the final activity of this section, we consider several questions related to
this context of a heat-seeking missile, and foreshadow some upcoming work in
Section 10.7.

       tion. State the fighter jet's location and explain how Figure 10.6.6 tells
       you this.

   b. Determine T at the fighter jet's location and give a justification for

      local maximum?)

   d. Suppose that a function g has a local minimum value at (x0, y0). Sketch
       the behavior of some possible contours near this point. What is g(x0, y0)?

10.6.7 Summary

   · The directional derivative of f at the point (x, y) in the direction of the
      unit vector u = u1, u2 is

                Duf (x, y) = lim f (x + u1h, y + u2h) - f (x, y)
                h0            h

    for those values of x and y for which the limit exists. In addition,
    Duf (x, y) measures the slope of the graph of f when we move in the
    direction u. Alternatively, Duf (x0, y0) measures the instantaneous rate
    of change of f in the direction u at (x0, y0).

   · The gradient of a function f = f (x, y) at a point (x0, y0) is the vector

                f (x0, y0) = fx(x0, y0), fy(x0, y0) .

   · The directional derivative in the direction u may be computed by
                                   Duf (x0, y0) = f (x0, y0) · u.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 168

· At any point where the gradient is nonzero, gradient is orthogonal to
   the contour through that point and points in the direction in which f
   increases most rapidly; moreover, the slope of f in this direction equals
   the length of the gradient |f (x0, y0)|. Similarly, the opposite of the
   gradient points in the direction of greatest decrease, and that rate of
   decrease is the opposite of the length of the gradient.

10.7 Optimization

Motivating Questions

   · How can we find the points at which f (x, y) has a local maximum or
       minimum?

   · How can we determine whether critical points of f (x, y) are local maxima
       or minima?

   · How can we find the absolute maximum and minimum of f (x, y) on a
       closed and bounded domain?

    We learn in single-variable calculus that the derivative is a useful tool for
finding the local maxima and minima of functions, and that these ideas may
often be employed in applied settings. In particular, if a function f , such
as the one shown in Figure 10.7.1 is everywhere differentiable, we know that
the tangent line is horizontal at any point where f has a local maximum or
minimum. This, of course, means that the derivative f is zero at any such
point. Hence, one way that we seek extreme values of a given function is to
first find where the derivative of the function is zero.

Figure 10.7.1 The graph of y = f (x).
    In multivariable calculus, we are often similarly interested in finding the

greatest and/or least value(s) that a function may achieve. Moreover, there
are many applied settings in which a quantity of interest depends on several
different variables. In the following preview activity, we begin to see how
some key ideas in multivariable calculus can help us answer such questions
by thinking about the geometry of the surface generated by a function of two
variables.
Preview Activity 10.7.1 Let z = f (x, y) be a differentiable function, and
suppose that at the point (x0, y0), f achieves a local maximum. That is, the
value of f (x0, y0) is greater than the value of f (x, y) for all (x, y) nearby (x0, y0).
You might find it helpful to sketch a rough picture of a possible function f that
has this property.

   a. If we consider the trace given by holding y = y0 constant, then the single-
       variable function defined by f (x, y0) must have a local maximum at x0.
       What does this say about the value of the partial derivative fx(x0, y0)?

   b. In the same way, the trace given by holding x = x0 constant has a local
       maximum at y = y0. What does this say about the value of the partial
       derivative fy(x0, y0)?

   c. What may we now conclude about the gradient f (x0, y0) at the local
       maximum? How is this consistent with the statement "f increases most
       rapidly in the direction f (x0, y0)?"

   d. How will the tangent plane to the surface z = f (x, y) appear at the point
       (x0, y0, f (x0, y0))?

   e. By first computing the partial derivatives, find any points at which
       f (x, y) = 2x - x2 - (y + 2)2 may have a local maximum.

10.7.1 Extrema and Critical Points

One of the important applications of single-variable calculus is the use of deriva-
tives to identify local extremes of functions (that is, local maxima and local
minima). Using the tools we have developed so far, we can naturally extend
the concept of local maxima and minima to several-variable functions.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 174

Definition 10.7.2 Let f be a function of two variables x and y.

   · The function f has a local maximum at a point (x0, y0) provided that
       f (x, y)  f (x0, y0) for all points (x, y) near (x0, y0). In this situation we
       say that f (x0, y0) is a local maximum value.

   · The function f has a local minimum at a point (x0, y0) provided that
       f (x, y)  f (x0, y0) for all points (x, y) near (x0, y0). In this situation we
       say that f (x0, y0) is a local minimum value.

   · An absolute maximum point is a point (x0, y0) for which f (x, y)  f (x0, y0)
       for all points (x, y) in the domain of f . The value of f at an absolute
       maximum point is the maximum value of f .

   · An absolute minimum point is a point such that f (x, y)  f (x0, y0) for all
       points (x, y) in the domain of f . The value of f at an absolute minimum
       point is the maximum value of f .

                                                                                                     
    We use the term extremum point to refer to any point (x0, y0) at which f
has a local maximum or minimum. In addition, the function value f (x0, y0) at
an extremum is called an extremal value. Figure 10.7.3 illustrates the graphs
of two functions that have an absolute maximum and minimum, respectively,
at the origin (x0, y0) = (0, 0).

Figure 10.7.3 An absolute maximum and an absolute minimum

    In single-variable calculus, we saw that the extrema of a continuous function
f always occur at critical points, values of x where f fails to be differentiable
or where f (x) = 0. Said differently, critical points provide the locations where
extrema of a function may appear. Our work in Preview Activity 10.7.1 sug-
gests that something similar happens with two-variable functions.

    Suppose that a continuous function f has an extremum at (x0, y0). In this
case, the trace f (x, y0) has an extremum at x0, which means that x0 is a critical
value of f (x, y0). Therefore, either fx(x0, y0) does not exist or fx(x0, y0) = 0.
Similarly, either fy(x0, y0) does not exist or fy(x0, y0) = 0. This implies that
the extrema of a two-variable function occur at points that satisfy the following
definition.

Definition 10.7.4 A critical point (x0, y0) of a function f = f (x, y) is a

point in the domain of f at which fx(x0, y0) = 0 and fy(x0, y0) = 0, or such

that one of fx(x0, y0) or fy(x0, y0) fails to exist.       

We can therefore find critical points of a function f by computing partial

derivatives and identifying any values of (x, y) for which one of the partials
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 175

doesn't exist or for which both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero. For
the latter, note that we have to solve the system of equations

                                           fx(x, y) = 0
                                           fy(x, y) = 0.

Activity 10.7.2 Find the critical points of each of the following functions.
Then, using appropriate technology, plot the graphs of the surfaces near each
critical value and compare the graph to your work.

   a. f (x, y) = 2 + x2 + y2

   b. f (x, y) = 2 + x2 - y2

   c. f (x, y) = 2x - x2 - 14 y2
   d. f (x, y) = |x| + |y|

   e. f (x, y) = 2xy - 4x + 2y - 3.

10.7.2 Classifying Critical Points: The Second Derivative
          Test

While the extrema of a continuous function f always occur at critical points, it
is important to note that not every critical point leads to an extremum. Recall,
for instance, f (x) = x3 from single variable calculus. We know that x0 = 0 is
a critical point since f (x0) = 0, but x0 = 0 is neither a local maximum nor a
local minimum of f .

    A similar situation may arise in a multivariable setting. Consider the func-
tion f defined by f (x, y) = x2 - y2 whose graph and contour plot are shown in
Figure 10.7.5. Because f = 2x, -2y , we see that the origin (x0, y0) = (0, 0)
is a critical point. However, this critical point is neither a local maximum or
minimum; the origin is a local minimum on the trace defined by y = 0, while
the origin is a local maximum on the trace defined by x = 0. We call such
a critical point a saddle point due to the shape of the graph near the critical
point.

                          z

Figure 10.7.5 A saddle point.

    As in single-variable calculus, we would like to have some sort of test to
help us identify whether a critical point is a local maximum, local maximum,
or neither.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 176

Activity 10.7.3 Recall that the Second Derivative Test for single-variable
functions states that if x0 is a critical point of a function f so that f (x0) = 0
and if f (x0) exists, then

   · if f (x0) < 0, x0 is a local maximum,
   · if f (x0) > 0, x0 is a local minimum, and
   · if f (x0) = 0, this test yields no information.
    Our goal in this activity is to understand a similar test for classifying ex-
treme values of functions of two variables. Consider the following three func-
tions:

         f1(x, y) = 4 - x2 - y2, f2(x, y) = x2 + y2, f3(x, y) = x2 - y2.

You can verify that each function has a critical point at the origin (0, 0). You
should check this.

                                                                                                                               z

                                                                x                   y

Figure 10.7.6 Three surfaces.

a. The graphs of these three functions are shown in Figure 10.7.6, with
   z = 4 - x2 - y2 at left, z = x2 + y2 in the middle, and z = x2 - y2 at
   right. Use the graphs to decide if a function has a local maximum, local
   minimum, saddle point, or none of the above at the origin.

b. There is no single second derivative of a function of two variables, so we

consider a quantity that combines the second order partial derivatives.

Let  D  =  fxx  fyy  -  f2    .  Calculate  D  at  the  origin  for  each  of  the  functions

                          xy

f1, f2, and f3. What difference do you notice between the values of D

when a function has a maximum or minimum value at the origin versus

when a function has a saddle point at the origin?

   c. Now consider the cases where D > 0. It is in these cases that a function
       has a local maximum or minimum at a point. What is necessary in these
       cases is to find a condition that will distinguish between a maximum and
       a minimum. In the cases where D > 0 at the origin, evaluate fxx(0, 0).
       What value does fxx(0, 0) have when f has a local maximum value at
       the origin? When f has a local minimum value at the origin? Explain
       why. (Hint: This should look very similar to the Second Derivative Test
       for functions of a single variable.) What would happen if we considered
       the values of fyy(0, 0) instead?

    Activity 10.7.3 provides the basic ideas for the Second Derivative Test for
functions of two variables.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 177

                         The Second Derivative Test.

Suppose (x0, y0) is a critical point of the function f for which fx(x0, y0) =
0 and fy(x0, y0) = 0. Let D be the quantity defined by

                   D = fxx(x0, y0)fyy(x0, y0) - fxy(x0, y0)2.

   · If D > 0 and fxx(x0, y0) < 0, then f has a local maximum at
       (x0, y0).

   · If D > 0 and fxx(x0, y0) > 0, then f has a local minimum at
       (x0, y0).

   · If D < 0, then f has a saddle point at (x0, y0).

   · If D = 0, then this test yields no information about what happens
       at (x0, y0).

    The quantity D is called the discriminant of the function f at
(x0, y0).

    To properly understand the origin of the Second Derivative Test, we could
introduce a "second-order directional derivative." If this second-order direc-
tional derivative were negative in every direction, for instance, we could guar-
antee that the critical point is a local maximum. A complete justification of
the Second Derivative Test requires key ideas from linear algebra that are be-
yond the scope of this course, so instead of presenting a detailed explanation,
we will accept this test as stated. In Activity 10.7.4, we apply the test to more
complicated examples.

Activity 10.7.4 Find the critical points of the following functions and use the
Second Derivative Test to classify the critical points.

   a. f (x, y) = 3x3 + y2 - 9x + 4y

b.  f (x, y) = xy +  2  +  4
                     x     y

   c. f (x, y) = x3 + y3 - 3xy.

    As we learned in single-variable calculus, finding extremal values of func-
tions can be particularly useful in applied settings. For instance, we can often
use calculus to determine the least expensive way to construct something or to
find the most efficient route between two locations. The same possibility holds
in settings with two or more variables.

Activity 10.7.5 While the quantity of a product demanded by consumers is
often a function of the price of the product, the demand for a product may also
depend on the price of other products. For instance, the demand for blue jeans
at Old Navy may be affected not only by the price of the jeans themselves, but
also by the price of khakis.

    Suppose we have two goods whose respective prices are p1 and p2. The
demand for these goods, q1 and q2, depend on the prices as

                              q1 = 150 - 2p1 - p2   (10.7.1)
                              q2 = 200 - p1 - 3p2.  (10.7.2)

    The seller would like to set the prices p1 and p2 in order to maximize
revenue. We will assume that the seller meets the full demand for each product.
Thus, if we let R be the revenue obtained by selling q1 items of the first good
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 178

at price p1 per item and q2 items of the second good at price p2 per item, we
have

                                        R = p1q1 + p2q2.
    We can then write the revenue as a function of just the two variables p1
and p2 by using Equations (10.7.1) and (10.7.2), giving us

                 R(p1, p2) = p1(150 - 2p1 - p2) + p2(200 - p1 - 3p2)
                             = 150p1 + 200p2 - 2p1p2 - 2p21 - 3p22.

    A graph of R as a function of p1 and p2 is shown in Figure 10.7.7.

10.7.3 Optimization on a Restricted Domain

The Second Derivative Test helps us classify critical points of a function, but it
does not tell us if the function actually has an absolute maximum or minimum
at each such point. For single-variable functions, the Extreme Value Theorem
told us that a continuous function on a closed interval [a, b] always has both
an absolute maximum and minimum on that interval, and that these absolute
extremes must occur at either an endpoint or at a critical point. Thus, to
find the absolute maximum and minimum, we determine the critical points
in the interval and then evaluate the function at these critical points and at
the endpoints of the interval. A similar approach works for functions of two
variables.

    For functions of two variables, closed and bounded regions play the role
that closed intervals did for functions of a single variable. A closed region is a
region that contains its boundary (the unit disk x2 + y2  1 is closed, while its
interior x2 + y2 < 1 is not, for example), while a bounded region is one that
does not stretch to infinity in any direction. Just as for functions of a single
variable, continuous functions of several variables that are defined on closed,
bounded regions must have absolute maxima and minima in those regions.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 179

                       The Extreme Value Theorem.

Let f = f (x, y) be a continuous function on a closed and bounded
region R. Then f has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum
in R.

    The absolute extremes must occur at either a critical point in the interior
of R or at a boundary point of R. We therefore must test both possibilities,
as we demonstrate in the following example.

Example 10.7.8 Suppose the temperature T at each point on the circular
plate x2 + y2  1 is given by

                                    T (x, y) = 2x2 + y2 - y.

    The domain R = {(x, y) : x2 + y2  1} is a closed and bounded region, as
shown on the left of Figure 10.7.9, so the Extreme Value Theorem assures us
that T has an absolute maximum and minimum on the plate. The graph of
T over its domain R is shown in Figure 10.7.9. We will find the hottest and
coldest points on the plate.

Figure 10.7.9 Domain of the temperature T (x, y) = 2x2 + y2 - y and its
graph.

    If the absolute maximum or minimum occurs inside the disk, it will be at
a critical point so we begin by looking for critical points inside the disk. To do
this, notice that critical points are given by the conditions Tx = 4x = 0 and
Ty = 2y - 1 = 0. This means that there is one critical point of the function at
the point (x0, y0) = (0, 1/2), which lies inside the disk.

    We now find the hottest and coldest points on the boundary of the disk,
which is the circle of radius 1. As we have seen, the points on the unit circle
can be parametrized as

                         x(t) = cos(t), y(t) = sin(t),

where 0  t  2. The temperature at a point on the circle is then described
by

                        T (x(t), y(t)) = 2 cos2(t) + sin2(t) - sin(t).

    To find the hottest and coldest points on the boundary, we look for the
critical points of this single-variable function on the interval 0  t  2. We
have

                dT
                     = -4 cos(t) sin(t) + 2 cos(t) sin(t) - cos(t)

                 dt
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 180

= -2 cos(t) sin(t) - cos(t) = cos(t)(-2 sin(t) - 1)
= 0.

    This shows that we have critical points when cos(t) = 0 or sin(t) = -1/2.
This occurs when t = /2, 3/2, 7/6, and 11/6. Since we have x(t) = cos(t)
and y(t) = sin(t), the corresponding points are

· (x, y) = (0, 1) when t = 2 ,         · (x, y) = (0, -1) when t = 23 ,

                                                                  

· (x, y) = 3 2 , - 12 when t = 11 6 .  · (x, y) = - 3 2 , - 12 when t = 67 .

    These are the critical points of T on the boundary and so this collection of
points includes the hottest and coldest points on the boundary.

    We now have a list of candidates for the hottest and coldest points: the
critical point in the interior of the disk and the critical points on the boundary.
We find the hottest and coldest points by evaluating the temperature at each
of these points, and find that

· T 0, 12 = - 14 ,       · T (0, 1) = 0,           · T (0, -1) = 2,
· T - 3 2 , - 12 = 94 ,
                                           = 94 .

                         · T - 3 2 , - 12

    So the maximum value of T on the disk x2 + y2  1 is 94 , which occurs at

                                   

the two points ± 3 2 , - 12 on the boundary, and the minimum value of T on
the disk is - 14 which occurs at the critical point 0, 12 in the interior of R.

    From this example, we see that we use the following procedure for deter-
mining the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function on a closed
and bounded domain.

· Find all critical points of the function in the interior of the domain.

· Find all the critical points of the function on the boundary of the domain.
   Working on the boundary of the domain reduces this part of the problem
   to one or more single variable optimization problems. Note that there
   may be endpoints on portions of the boundary that need to be considered.

· Evaluate the function at each of the points found in Steps 1 and 2.

   · The maximum value of the function is the largest value obtained in Step
       3, and the minimum value of the function is the smallest value obtained
       in Step 3.

whose vertices are at (0, 0), (4, 0), and (0, 4). The domain R and a graph of f

10.7.4 Summary

   · To find the extrema of a function f = f (x, y), we first find the critical
       points, which are points where one of the partials of f fails to exist, or
       where fx = 0 and fy = 0.

   · The Second Derivative Test helps determine whether a critical point is a
       local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point.

   · If f is defined on a closed and bounded domain, we find the absolute
       maxima and minima by finding the critical points in the interior of the
       domain, finding the critical points on the boundary, and testing the value
       of f at both sets of critical points.

      a local minimum (7,3) is a saddle point (7,3) is a none of these)

           (c) Supposed that at (9, 4), we know that fx = fy = 0 and fxx < 0,
      fyy = 0, and fxy > 0. What can we conclude about the behavior of this
      function near the point (9, 4)? ( (9,4) is a local maximum (9,4) is
      a local minimum (9,4) is a saddle point (9,4) is a none of these)

      contour diagram for f .

15. Find the volume of the largest rectangular box with edges parallel to the
      axes that can be inscribed in the ellipsoid

                                           16 81 4

           Hint: By symmetry, you can restrict your attention to the first octant
      (where x, y, z  0), and assume your volume has the form V = 8xyz.
      Then arguing by symmetry, you need only look for points which achieve
      the maximum which lie in the first octant.

17. Respond to each of the following prompts to solve the given optimization
      problem.

          a. Let f (x, y) = sin(x) + cos(y). Determine the absolute maximum
              and minimum values of f . At what points do these extreme values
              occur?

b. For a certain differentiable function F of two variables x and y, its
    partial derivatives are

          Fx(x, y) = x2 - y - 4 and Fy(x, y) = -x + y - 2.

    Find each of the critical points of F , and classify each as a local
    maximum, local minimum, or a saddle point.

c. Determine all critical points of T (x, y) = 48 + 3xy - x2y - xy2 and
   classify each as a local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point.

d.  Find  and  classify  all  critical  points  of  g(x, y)  =  x2  + 3y3 + 9y2 -
                                                                2

e. Find and classify all critical points of z = f (x, y) = ye-x2-2y2 .

f. Determine the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of f (x, y) =
   2 + 2x + 2y - x2 - y2 on the triangular plate in the first quadrant

   bounded by the lines x = 0, y = 0, and y = 9 - x.

g. Determine the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of f (x, y) =
   2 + 2x + 2y - x2 - y2 over the closed disk of points (x, y) such that
   (x - 1)2 + (y - 1)2  1.

          h. Find the point on the plane z = 6 - 3x - 2y that lies closest to the
              origin.

18. If a continuous function f of a single variable has two critical numbers c1
      and c2 at which f has relative maximum values, then f must have another
      critical number c3, because it is impossible to have two mountains with-
      out some sort of valley in between. The other critical point can be a saddle
      point (a pass between the mountains) or a local minimum (a true valley)."
      (From Calculus in Vector Spaces by Lawrence J. Corwin and Robert H.
      Szczarb.) Consider the function f defined by f (x, y) = 4x2ey - 2x4 - e4y.
      (From Ira Rosenholz in the Problems Section of the Mathematics Maga-
      zine, Vol. 60 NO. 1, February 1987.) Show that f has exactly two critical
      points, and that f has relative maximum values at each of these critical
      points. Explain how this function f illustrates that it really is possible to
      have two mountains without some sort of valley in between. Use appro-
      priate technology to draw the surface defined by f to see graphically how
      this happens.

19. If a continuous function f of a single variable has exactly one critical
      number with a relative maximum at that critical point, then the value
      of f at that critical point is an absolute maximum. In this exercise we
      see that the same is not always true for functions of two variables. Let
      f (x, y) = 3xey -x3 -e3y (from " The Only Critical Point in Town"" Test
      by Ira Rosenholz and Lowell Smylie in the Mathematics Magazine, VOL
      58 NO 3 May 1985.). Show that f has exactly one critical point, has a
      relative maximum value at that critical point, but that f has no absolute
      maximum value. Use appropriate technology to draw the surface defined
      by f to see graphically how this happens.

20. A manufacturer wants to procure rectangular boxes to ship its product.
      The boxes must contain 20 cubic feet of space. To be durable enough to
      ensure the safety of the product, the material for the sides of the boxes will
      cost $0.10 per square foot, while the material for the top and bottom will
      cost $0.25 per square foot. In this activity we will help the manufacturer
      determine the box of minimal cost.

          a. What quantities are constant in this problem? What are the vari-
              ables in this problem? Provide appropriate variable labels. What,
              if any, restrictions are there on the variables?

          b. Using your variables from (a), determine a formula for the total cost
              C of a box.

          c. Your formula in part (b) might be in terms of three variables. If so,
              find a relationship between the variables, and then use this relation-
              ship to write C as a function of only two independent variables.

          d. Find the dimensions that minimize the cost of a box. Be sure to
              verify that you have a minimum cost.

21. A rectangular box with length x, width y, and height z is being built.
      The box is positioned so that one corner is stationed at the origin and the
      box lies in the first octant where x, y, and z are all positive. There is an
      added constraint on how the box is constructed: it must fit underneath
      the plane with equation x + 2y + 3z = 6. In fact, we will assume that the
      corner of the box "opposite" the origin must actually lie on this plane.
      The basic problem is to find the maximum volume of the box.

          a. Sketch the plane x + 2y + 3z = 6, as well as a picture of a potential
              box. Label everything appropriately.

          b. Explain how you can use the fact that one corner of the box lies on
              the plane to write the volume of the box as a function of x and y
              only. Do so, and clearly show the formula you find for V (x, y).

          c. Find all critical points of V . (Note that when finding the critical
              points, it is essential that you factor first to make the algebra easier.)

          d. Without considering the current applied nature of the function V ,
              classify each critical point you found above as a local maximum,
              local minimum, or saddle point of V .

          e. Determine the maximum volume of the box, justifying your answer
              completely with an appropriate discussion of the critical points of
              the function.

           f. Now suppose that we instead stipulated that, while the vertex of
              the box opposite the origin still had to lie on the plane, we were
              only going to permit the sides of the box, x and y, to have values
              in a specified range (given below). That is, we now want to find the
              maximum value of V on the closed, bounded region

                                           1
                                               x  1, 1  y  2.

                                           2

              Find the maximum volume of the box under this condition, justify-
              ing your answer fully.

22. The airlines place restrictions on luggage that can be carried onto planes.
          · A carry-on bag can weigh no more than 40 lbs.

· The length plus width plus height of a bag cannot exceed 45 inches.

· The bag must fit in an overhead bin.

    Let x, y, and z be the length, width, and height (in inches) of a carry on
bag. In this problem we find the dimensions of the bag of largest volume,
V = xyz, that satisfies the second restriction. Assume that we use all
45 inches to get a maximum volume. (Note that this bag of maximum
volume might not satisfy the third restriction.)

a. Write the volume V = V (x, y) as a function of just the two variables
   x and y.

b. Explain why the domain over which V is defined is the triangular
    region R with vertices (0,0), (45,0), and (0,45).

c. Find the critical points, if any, of V in the interior of the region R.

d. Find the maximum value of V on the boundary of the region R,
    and then determine the dimensions of a bag with maximum volume
    on the entire region R. (Note that most carry-on bags sold today
    measure 22 by 14 by 9 inches with a volume of 2772 cubic inches,
    so that the bags will fit into the overhead bins.)

23. According to The Song of Insects byTable 10.7.11 Crickets chirping.

G.W. Pierce (Harvard College Press,       xy
1948) the sound of striped ground        20.0 88.6
crickets chirping, in number of chirps

per second, is related to the temper-    16.0 71.6

ature. So the number of chirps per       19.8 93.3

second could be a predictor of tem-      18.4 84.3

perature. The data Pierce collected      17.1 80.6
is shown in Table 10.7.11., where x      15.5 75.2
is the (average) number of chirps per    14.7 69.7
second and y is the temperature in       17.1 82.0
degrees Fahrenheit.                      15.4 69.4
A scatterplot of the data would show     16.2 83.3
that, while the relationship between     15.0 79.6
x and y is not exactly linear, it looks

to have a linear pattern. It could       17.2 82.6

be that the relationship is really lin-  16.0 80.6

ear but experimental error causes the    17.0 83.5

data to be slightly inaccurate. Or       14.4 76.3
perhaps the data is not linear, but

only approximately linear.

    If we want to use the data to make predications, then we need to fit
a curve of some kind to the data. Since the cricket data appears roughly
linear, we will fit a linear function f of the form f (x) = mx+b to the data.
We will do this in such a way that we minimize the sums of the squares
of the distances between the y values of the data and the corresponding
y values of the line defined by f . This type of fit is called a least squares
approximation. If the data is represented by the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2),
. . ., (xn, yn), then the square of the distance between yi and f (xi) is
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 189

(f (xi) - yi)2 = (mxi + b - yi)2. So our goal is to minimize the sum of
these squares, of minimize the function S defined by

                             n

        S(m, b) = (mxi + b - yi)2.

                           i=1

a. Calculate Sm and Sb.

b. Solve the system Sm(m, b) = 0 and Sb(m, b) = 0 to show that the
    critical point satisfies

       n(  i=1 n xiyi) - ( i=1 n xi) ( i=1 n yi)
m=         n ( i=1 n xi2) - ( i=1 n xi)2

     (     i=1 n yi) i=1 n xi2 - (     i=1 n xi) (  i=1 n xiyi) .
b=                 n ( i=1 n xi2) - (   i=1 n xi)2

(Hint: Don't be daunted by these expressions, the system Sm(m, b) =

0 and Sb(m, b) = 0 is a system of two linear equations in the un-
knowns m and b. It might be easier to let r = i=1 n xi2, s = i=1 n xi,
t = i=1 n yi, and u = i=1 n xiyi and write your equations using
these constants.)

c. Use the Second Derivative Test to explain why the critical point
   gives a local minimum. Can you then explain why the critical point
   gives an absolute minimum?

d. Use the formula from part (b) to find the values of m and b that
    give the line of best fit in the least squares sense to the cricket data.
    Draw your line on the scatter plot to convince yourself that you have
    a well-fitting line.

10.8 Constrained Optimization: Lagrange Mul-
       tipliers

Motivating Questions

   · What geometric condition enables us to optimize a function f = f (x, y)
       subject to a constraint given by g(x, y) = k, where k is a constant?

   · How can we exploit this geometric condition to find the extreme values
       of a function subject to a constraint?

    We previously considered how to find the extreme values of functions on
both unrestricted domains and on closed, bounded domains. Other types of
optimization problems involve maximizing or minimizing a quantity subject
to an external constraint. In these cases the extreme values frequently won't
occur at the points where the gradient is zero, but rather at other points that
satisfy an important geometric condition. These problems are often called con-
strained optimization problems and can be solved with the method of Lagrange
Multipliers, which we study in this section.

Preview Activity 10.8.1 According to U.S. postal regulations, the girth
plus the length of a parcel sent by mail may not exceed 108 inches, where
by "girth" we mean the perimeter of the smallest end. Our goal is to find
the largest possible volume of a rectangular parcel with a square end that
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 190

can be sent by mail. (We solved this applied optimization problem in single
variable Active Calculus, so it may look familiar. We take a different approach
in this section, and this approach allows us to view most applied optimization
problems from single variable calculus as constrained optimization problems,
as well as provide us tools to solve a greater variety of optimization problems.)
If we let x be the length of the side of one square end of the package and y
the length of the package, then we want to maximize the volume f (x, y) = x2y
of the box subject to the constraint that the girth (4x) plus the length (y) is
as large as possible, or 4x + y = 108. The equation 4x + y = 108 is thus an
external constraint on the variables.

   a. The constraint equation involves the function g that is given by

g(x, y) = 4x + y.

Explain why the constraint is a contour of g, and is therefore a two-
dimensional curve.

b. Figure 10.8.1 shows the graph of the constraint equation g(x, y) = 108
    along with a few contours of the volume function f . Since our goal is to
    find the maximum value of f subject to the constraint g(x, y) = 108, we
    want to find the point on our constraint curve that intersects the contours
    of f at which f has its largest value.

       i. Points A and B in Figure 10.8.1 lie on a contour of f and on the
          constraint equation g(x, y) = 108. Explain why neither A nor B
          provides a maximum value of f that satisfies the constraint.

      ii. Points C and D in Figure 10.8.1 lie on a contour of f and on the
          constraint equation g(x, y) = 108. Explain why neither C nor D
          provides a maximum value of f that satisfies the constraint.

     iii. Based on your responses to parts i. and ii., draw the contour of f
          on which you believe f will achieve a maximum value subject to the
          constraint g(x, y) = 108. Explain why you drew the contour you
          did.

c. Recall that g(x, y) = 108 is a contour of the function g, and that the
    gradient of a function is always orthogonal to its contours. With this in
    mind, how should f and g be related at the optimal point? Explain.

10.8.1 Constrained Optimization and Lagrange Multipli-
          ers

In Preview Activity 10.8.1, we considered an optimization problem where there
is an external constraint on the variables, namely that the girth plus the length
of the package cannot exceed 108 inches. We saw that we can create a function
g from the constraint, specifically g(x, y) = 4x + y. The constraint equation is
then just a contour of g, g(x, y) = c, where c is a constant (in our case 108).
Figure 10.8.2 illustrates that the volume function f is maximized, subject to
the constraint g(x, y) = c, when the graph of g(x, y) = c is tangent to a contour
of f . Moreover, the value of f on this contour is the sought maximum value.

Figure 10.8.2 Contours of f and the constraint contour.

    To find this point where the graph of the constraint is tangent to a contour
of f , recall that f is perpendicular to the contours of f and g is perpen-
dicular to the contour of g. At such a point, the vectors g and f are
parallel, and thus we need to determine the points where this occurs. Recall
that two vectors are parallel if one is a nonzero scalar multiple of the other, so
we therefore look for values of a parameter  that make

    f = g.                                                  (10.8.1)

    The constant  is called a Lagrange multiplier.
    To find the values of  that satisfy (10.8.1) for the volume function in
Preview Activity 10.8.1, we calculate both f and g. Observe that

                        f = 2xyi + x2j and g = 4i + j,

and thus we need a value of  so that
                                    2xyi + x2j = (4i + j).

    Equating components in the most recent equation and incorporating the
original constraint, we have three equations

       2xy = (4)                                            (10.8.2)
         x2 = (1)                                           (10.8.3)
                                                            (10.8.4)
    4x + y = 108

in the three unknowns x, y, and . First, note that if  = 0, then equation
(10.8.3) shows that x = 0. From this, Equation (10.8.4) tells us that y = 108.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 192

So the point (0, 108) is a point we need to consider. Next, provided that  = 0
(from which it follows that x = 0 by Equation (10.8.3)), we may divide both
sides of Equation (10.8.2) by the corresponding sides of (10.8.3) to eliminate
, and thus find that

                                            2y
                                                 = 4, so

                                             x
                                              y = 2x.

    Substituting into Equation (10.8.4) gives us

                                          4x + 2x = 108

or
                                              x = 18.

    Thus we have y = 2x = 36 and  = x2 = 324 as another point to consider.
So the points at which the gradients of f and g are parallel, and thus at which
f may have a maximum or minimum subject to the constraint, are (0, 108) and
(18, 36). By evaluating the function f at these points, we see that we maximize
the volume when the length of the square end of the box is 18 inches and the
length is 36 inches, for a maximum volume of f (18, 36) = 11664 cubic inches.
Since f (0, 108) = 0, we obtain a minimum value at this point.

    We summarize the process of Lagrange multipliers as follows.

                       The method of Lagrange multipliers.

    The general technique for optimizing a function f = f (x, y) subject to a
    constraint g(x, y) = c is to solve the system f = g and g(x, y) = c
    for x, y, and . We then evaluate the function f at each point (x, y)
    that results from a solution to the system in order to find the optimum
    values of f subject to the constraint.

Activity 10.8.2 A cylindrical soda can holds about 355 cc of liquid. In this
activity, we want to find the dimensions of such a can that will minimize the
surface area. For the sake of simplicity, assume the can is a perfect cylinder.

   a. What are the variables in this problem? Based on the context, what
       restriction(s), if any, are there on these variables?

   b. What quantity do we want to optimize in this problem? What equation
       describes the constraint? (You need to decide which of these functions
       plays the role of f and which plays the role of g in our discussion of
       Lagrange multipliers.)

   c. Find  and the values of your variables that satisfy Equation (10.8.1) in
       the context of this problem.

   d. Determine the dimensions of the pop can that give the desired solution
       to this constrained optimization problem.

    The method of Lagrange multipliers also works for functions of more than
two variables.
Activity 10.8.3 Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the dimensions
of the least expensive packing crate with a volume of 240 cubic feet when the
material for the top costs $2 per square foot, the bottom is $3 per square foot
and the sides are $1.50 per square foot.
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 193

    The method of Lagrange multipliers also works for functions of three vari-
ables. That is, if we have a function f = f (x, y, z) that we want to optimize
subject to a constraint g(x, y, z) = k, the optimal point (x, y, z) lies on the
level surface S defined by the constraint g(x, y, z) = k. As we did in Preview
Activity 10.8.1, we can argue that the optimal value occurs at the level surface
f (x, y, z) = c that is tangent to S. Thus, the gradients of f and g are parallel
at this optimal point. So, just as in the two variable case, we can optimize
f = f (x, y, z) subject to the constraint g(x, y, z) = k by finding all points
(x, y, z) that satisfy f = g and g(x, y, z) = k.

10.8.2 Summary

   · The extrema of a function f = f (x, y) subject to a constraint g(x, y) = c
       occur at points for which the contour of f is tangent to the curve that
       represents the constraint equation. This occurs when

                                               f = g.

   · We use the condition f = g to generate a system of equations,
       together with the constraint g(x, y) = c, that may be solved for x, y, and
       . Once we have all the solutions, we evaluate f at each of the (x, y)
       points to determine the extrema.

12. The Cobb-Douglas production function is used in economics to model
      production levels based on labor and equipment. Suppose we have a
      specific Cobb-Douglas function of the form

                          f (x, y) = 50x0.4y0.6,

      where x is the dollar amount spent on labor and y the dollar amount spent
      on equipment. Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to determine how
      much should be spent on labor and how much on equipment to maximize
      productivity if we have a total of 1.5 million dollars to invest in labor and
      equipment.

13. Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the point on the line
      x - 2y = 5 that is closest to the point (1, 3). To do so, respond to the

              distance from (x, y) to (1, 3). (The extrema of this function are the
              same as the extrema of the distance function, but f (x, y) is simpler
              to work with.)

          b. Determine the points on the sphere x2+y2+z2 = 4 that are closest to
              and farthest from the point (3, 1, -1). (As in the preceding exercise,
              you may find it simpler to work with the square of the distance
              formula, rather than the distance formula itself.)

          c. Find the absolute maximum and minimum of f (x, y, z) = x2+y2+z2
              subject to the constraint that (x-3)2+(y+2)2+(z-5)2  16. (Hint:
              here the constraint is a closed, bounded region. Use the boundary
              of that region for applying Lagrange Multipliers, but don't forget to
              also test any critical values of the function that lie in the interior of
              the region.)

15. In this exercise we consider how to apply the Method of Lagrange Mul-
      tipliers to optimize functions of three variable subject to two constraints.
      Suppose we want to optimize f = f (x, y, z) subject to the constraints
      g(x, y, z) = c and h(x, y, z) = k. Also suppose that the two level surfaces
      g(x, y, z) = c and h(x, y, z) = k intersect at a curve C. The optimum
      point P = (x0, y0, z0) will then lie on C.
          a. Assume that C can be represented parametrically by a vector-valued
                                            --
              function r = r(t). Let OP = r(t0). Use the Chain Rule applied to
              f (r(t)), g(r(t)), and h(r(t)), to explain why

                                      f (x0, y0, z0) · r (t0) = 0,
                                      g(x0, y0, z0) · r (t0) = 0, and
                                      h(x0, y0, z0) · r (t0) = 0.

              Explain how this shows that f (x0, y0, z0), g(x0, y0, z0), and h(x0, y0, z0)
              are all orthogonal to C at P . This shows that f (x0, y0, z0), g(x0, y0, z0),
              and h(x0, y0, z0) all lie in the same plane.

          b. Assuming that g(x0, y0, z0) and h(x0, y0, z0) are nonzero and
              not parallel, explain why every point in the plane determined by
              g(x0, y0, z0) and h(x0, y0, z0) has the form sg(x0, y0, z0)+th(x0, y0, z0)
              for some scalars s and t.

          c. Parts (a.) and (b.) show that there must exist scalars  and µ such
              that

                         f (x0, y0, z0) = g(x0, y0, z0) + µh(x0, y0, z0).

              So to optimize f = f (x, y, z) subject to the constraints g(x, y, z) = c
              and h(x, y, z) = k we must solve the system of equations

                               f (x, y, z) = g(x, y, z) + µh(x, y, z),
CHAPTER 10. DERIVATIVES OF MULTIVARIABLE FUNCTIONS 198

                                  g(x, y, z) = c, and
                                  h(x, y, z) = k.

              for x, y, z, , and µ.
              Use this idea to find the maximum and minium values of f (x, y, z) =
              x + 2y subject to the constraints y2 + z2 = 8 and x + y + z = 10.
16. There is a useful interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier . Assume
      that we want to optimize a function f with constraint g(x, y) = c. Recall
      that an optimal solution occurs at a point (x0, y0) where f = g. As
      the constraint changes, so does the point at which the optimal solution
      occurs. So we can think of the optimal point as a function of the parameter
      c, that is x0 = x0(c) and y0 = y0(c). The optimal value of f subject
      to the constraint can then be considered as a function of c defined by
      f (x0(c), y0(c)). The Chain Rule shows that

                                      df = f dx0 + f dy0 .
                                      dc x0 dc y0 dc

          a. Use the fact that f = g at (x0, y0) to explain why

                                                    df dg
                                                        = .

                                                    dc dc

          b. Use the fact that g(x, y) = c to show that

                                                      df
                                                          = .

                                                      dc

              Conclude that  tells us the rate of change of the function f as the
              parameter c increases (or by approximately how much the optimal
              value of the function f will change if we increase the value of c by 1
              unit).

          c. Suppose that  = 324 at the point where the package described
              in Preview Activity 10.8.1 has its maximum volume. Explain in
              context what the value 324 tells us about the package.

          d. Suppose that the maximum value of a function f = f (x, y) subject
              to a constraint g(x, y) = 100 is 236. When using the method of
              Lagrange multipliers and solving f = g, we obtain a value of
               = 15 at this maximum. Find an approximation to the maximum
              value of f subject to the constraint g(x, y) = 98.

11.1 Double Riemann Sums and Double Inte-
       grals over Rectangles

Motivating Questions

   · What is a double Riemann sum?
   · How is the double integral of a continuous function f = f (x, y) defined?
   · What are two things the double integral of a function can tell us?
    In single-variable calculus, recall that we approximated the area under the
graph of a positive function f on an interval [a, b] by adding areas of rectangles
whose heights are determined by the curve. The general process involved
subdividing the interval [a, b] into smaller subintervals, constructing rectangles
on each of these smaller intervals to approximate the region under the curve on
that subinterval, then summing the areas of these rectangles to approximate
the area under the curve. We will extend this process in this section to its
three-dimensional analogs, double Riemann sums and double integrals over
rectangles.
Preview Activity 11.1.1 In this activity we introduce the concept of a double
Riemann sum.
   a. Review the concept of the Riemann sum from single-variable calculus.

                                                                                                           b

       Then, explain how we define the definite integral a f (x) dx of a contin-
       uous function of a single variable x on an interval [a, b]. Include a sketch
       of a continuous function on an interval [a, b] with appropriate labeling in
       order to illustrate your definition.
   b. In our upcoming study of integral calculus for multivariable functions,
       we will first extend the idea of the single-variable definite integral to
       functions of two variables over rectangular domains. To do so, we will
       need to understand how to partition a rectangle into subrectangles. Let
       R be rectangular domain R = {(x, y) : 0  x  6, 2  y  4} (we can
       also represent this domain with the notation [0, 6] × [2, 4]), as pictured in

Figure 11.1.1 Rectangular domain R with subrectangles.

To form a partition of the full rectangular region, R, we will partition both
intervals [0, 6] and [2, 4]; in particular, we choose to partition the interval
[0, 6] into three uniformly sized subintervals and the interval [2, 4] into
two evenly sized subintervals as shown in Figure 11.1.1. In the following
questions, we discuss how to identify the endpoints of each subinterval
and the resulting subrectangles.

   i. Let 0 = x0 < x1 < x2 < x3 = 6 be the endpoints of the subintervals
      of [0, 6] after partitioning. What is the length x of each subinterval
      [xi-1, xi] for i from 1 to 3?

  ii. Explicitly identify x0, x1, x2, and x3. On Figure 11.1.1 or your own
      version of the diagram, label these endpoints.

 iii. Let 2 = y0 < y1 < y2 = 4 be the endpoints of the subintervals of
      [2, 4] after partitioning. What is the length y of each subinterval
      [yj-1, yj] for j from 1 to 2? Identify y0, y1, and y2 and label these
      endpoints on Figure 11.1.1.

 iv. Let Rij denote the subrectangle [xi-1, xi]×[yj-1, yj]. Appropriately
      label each subrectangle in your drawing of Figure 11.1.1. How does
      the total number of subrectangles depend on the partitions of the
      intervals [0, 6] and [2, 4]?

  v. What is area A of each subrectangle?

11.1.1 Double Riemann Sums over Rectangles

For the definite integral in single-variable calculus, we considered a continuous
function over a closed, bounded interval [a, b]. In multivariable calculus, we
will eventually develop the idea of a definite integral over a closed, bounded
region (such as the interior of a circle). We begin with a simpler situation by
thinking only about rectangular domains, and will address more complicated
domains in Section 11.3.

    Let f = f (x, y) be a continuous function defined on a rectangular domain
R = {(x, y) : a  x  b, c  y  d}. As we saw in Preview Activity 11.1.1, the
domain is a rectangle R and we want to partition R into subrectangles. We do
this by partitioning each of the intervals [a, b] and [c, d] into subintervals and
using those subintervals to create a partition of R into subrectangles. In the
first activity, we address the quantities and notations we will use in order to
define double Riemann sums and double integrals.

Activity 11.1.2 Let f (x, y) = 100 - x2 - y2 be defined on the rectangular
domain R = [a, b] × [c, d]. Partition the interval [a, b] into four uniformly
sized subintervals and the interval [c, d] into three evenly sized subintervals as

shown in Figure 11.1.2. As we did in Preview Activity 11.1.1, we will need
a method for identifying the endpoints of each subinterval and the resulting
subrectangles.

    be in terms of a and b.

   [c, d] after partitioning. Label these endpoints in Figure 11.1.2.

11.1.2 Double Riemann Sums and Double Integrals

Now we use the process from the most recent activity to formally define double
Riemann sums and double integrals.

Definition 11.1.3 Let f be a continuous function on a rectangle R = {(x, y) :
a  x  b, c  y  d}. A double Riemann sum for f over R is created as
follows.

   · Partition the interval [a, b] into m subintervals of equal length x = m b-a .
       Let x0, x1, . . ., xm be the endpoints of these subintervals, where a = x0 <
       x1 < x2 < · · · < xm = b.

   · Partition the interval [c, d] into n subintervals of equal length y = n d-c .
      Let y0, y1, . . ., yn be the endpoints of these subintervals, where c = y0 <

      y1 < y2 < · · · < yn = d.

   · These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle R into mn subrect-
      angles Rij with opposite vertices (xi-1, yj-1) and (xi, yj) for i between
      1 and m and j between 1 and n. These rectangles all have equal area
      A = x · y.

   ·  Choose  a  point  (  x      ,  yij  )  in  each  rectangle  Rij .  Then,  a  double  Riemann
                              ij

      sum for f over R is given by

                                              nm

                                                      f (xij , yij ) · A.

                                             j=1 i=1

                                                                                                     
    If f (x, y)  0 on the rectangle R, we may ask to find the volume of the
solid bounded above by f over R, as illustrated on the left of Figure 11.1.4.
This volume is approximated by a Riemann sum, which sums the volumes of
the rectangular boxes shown on the right of Figure 11.1.4.

      z                                                   z

              z = f (x, y)

                                                 y                                         y

Figure 11.1.4 The volume under a graph approximated by a Riemann Sum.

    As we let the number of subrectangles increase without bound (in other
words, as both m and n in a double Riemann sum go to infinity), as illustrated
in Figure 11.1.5, the sum of the volumes of the rectangular boxes approaches
the volume of the solid bounded above by f over R. The value of this limit,
provided it exists, is the double integral.

Definition 11.1.6 Let R be a rectangular region in the xy-plane and f a
continuous function over R. With terms defined as in a double Riemann sum,
the double integral of f over R is

                                                              nm

                           f (x, y) dA = lim                       f (xij , yij ) · A.
                    R m,n j=1 i=1

                                                                                                     

    Some textbooks use the notation R f (x, y) dA for a double integral. You
will see this in some of the WeBWorK problems.

11.1.3 Interpretation of Double Riemann Sums and Dou-
          ble integrals.

At the moment, there are two ways we can interpret the value of the double
integral.

   · Suppose that f (x, y) assumes both positive and negatives values on the

   rectangle R, as shown on the left of Figure 11.1.7. When constructing

   a  Riemann           sum,        for  each     i  and  j,  the  product  f  (x      ,  yij  )  ·  A  can  be
                                                                                   ij

   interpreted as a "signed" volume of a box with base area A and "signed"

   height  f  (  x      ,  yij  ).  Since  f      can  have   negative  values,    this   "height"      could
                    ij

   be negative. The sum

                                            nm

                                                    f (xij , yij ) · A

                                           j=1 i=1

   can then be interpreted as a sum of "signed" volumes of boxes, with a
   negative sign attached to those boxes whose heights are below the xy-
   plane.

                                    z = f (x, y)

                                                             y
                                          R

   We can then realize the double integral R f (x, y) dA as a difference in
   volumes: R f (x, y) dA tells us the volume of the solids the graph of f
   bounds above the xy-plane over the rectangle R minus the volume of the
   solids the graph of f bounds below the xy-plane under the rectangle R.
   This is shown on the right of Figure 11.1.7.

· The average of the finitely many mn values f (xij, yij) that we take in a
   double Riemann sum is given by

                                                1 nm                     
                           Avgmn = mn                                f (xij , yij ).

                                                   j=1 i=1

    If we take the limit as m and n go to infinity, we obtain what we define
    as the average value of f over the region R, which is connected to the
    value of the double integral. First, to view Avg mn as a double Riemann
    sum, note that

                       x =         b-a             and y =               d-c          .

                                    m                                       n

    Thus,

                                1  =            x · y                =   A  ,

                           mn (b - a)(d - c) A(R)

    where A(R) denotes the area of the rectangle R. Then, the average value
    of the function f over R, fAVG(R), is given by

                                                   1 nm                  
                   fAVG(R) = lim                                     f (xij , yij )
                                 m,n mn
                                                       j=1 i=1

                                                   1 nm                  
                           = lim                                         f (xij, yij) · A
                              m,n A(R)
                                                         j=1 i=1

                                 1                   f (x, y) dA.
                           =
                                                   R
                              A(R)

    Therefore, the double integral of f over R divided by the area of R gives
    us the average value of the function f on R. Finally, if f (x, y)  0 on
    R, we can interpret this average value of f on R as the height of the
    box with base R that has the same volume as the volume of the surface
    defined by f over R.

   a. Draw a picture of R. Partition [0, 2] into 2 subintervals of equal length
       and the interval [1, 3] into two subintervals of equal length. Draw these
       partitions on your picture of R and label the resulting subrectangles using
       the labeling scheme we established in the definition of a double Riemann
       sum.

b.  For  each  i  and  j,  let  (x      ,  yij  )  be    the    midpoint    of        the  rectangle  Rij .

    Identify  the  coordinates     of      each    (  x  ij  ,       ).  Draw these points on your

    picture of R.

using  the  partitions  we  have  described.  If  we  let  (x      ,  yij  )  be  the  midpoint

of the rectangle Rij for each i and j, then the resulting Riemann sum is

called a midpoint sum.

                       Properties of Double Integrals.

Let f and g be continuous functions on a rectangle R = {(x, y) : a 
x  b, c  y  d}, and let k be a constant. Then

   1. R(f (x, y) + g(x, y)) dA = R f (x, y) dA + R g(x, y) dA.
   2. R kf (x, y) dA = k R f (x, y) dA.
   3. If f (x, y)  g(x, y) on R, then R f (x, y) dA  R g(x, y) dA.

11.1.4 Summary

   · Let f be a continuous function on a rectangle R = {(x, y) : a  x  b, c 
       y  d}. The double Riemann sum for f over R is created as follows.

            Partition the interval [a, b] into m subintervals of equal length x =
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                                        206

  m b-a . Let x0, x1, . . ., xm be the endpoints of these subintervals,
  where a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xm = b.

 Partition the interval [c, d] into n subintervals of equal length y =

   n d-c . Let y0, y1, . . ., yn be the endpoints of these subintervals, where
   c = y0 < y1 < y2 < · · · < yn = d.

 These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle R into mn
   subrectangles Rij with opposite vertices (xi-1, yj-1) and (xi, yj) for
   i between 1 and m and j between 1 and n. These rectangles all have
   equal area A = x · y.

  Choose  a  point  (  x      ,  yij  )  in  each  rectangle  Rij .  Then  a  double  Rie-
                          ij

  mann sum for f over R is given by

                                  nm

                                          f (xij , yij ) · A.

                                 j=1 i=1

· With terms defined as in the Double Riemann Sum, the double integral
   of f over R is

                                                   nm

             f (x, y) dA = lim                         f (xij , yij ) · A.
             R m,n j=1 i=1

· Two interpretations of the double integral R f (x, y) dA are:

        The volume of the solids the graph of f bounds above the xy-plane
          over the rectangle R minus the volume of the solids the graph of f
          bounds below the xy-plane under the rectangle R;

        Dividing the double integral of f over R by the area of R gives us
          the average value of the function f on R. If f (x, y)  0 on R, we
          can interpret this average value of f on R as the height of the box
          with base R that has the same volume as the volume of the surface
          defined by f over R.

11.2 Iterated Integrals

Motivating Questions

   · How do we evaluate a double integral over a rectangle as an iterated
       integral, and why does this process work?

    Recall that we defined the double integral of a continuous function f =
f (x, y) over a rectangle R = [a, b] × [c, d] as

                           nm

        f (x, y) dA = lim                      f      xij , yij  · A,
        R m,n j=1 i=1

where the different variables and notation are as described in Section 11.1.
Thus R f (x, y) dA is a limit of double Riemann sums, but while this definition
tells us exactly what a double integral is, it is not very helpful for determining
the value of a double integral. Fortunately, there is a way to view a double
integral as an iterated integral, which will make computations feasible in many
cases.

    The viewpoint of an iterated integral is closely connected to an important
idea from single-variable calculus. When we studied solids of revolution, such
as the one shown in Figure 11.2.1, we saw that in some circumstances we could
slice the solid perpendicular to an axis and have each slice be approximately
a circular disk. From there, we were able to find the volume of each disk, and
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                211

then use an integral to add the volumes of the slices. In what follows, we are
able to use single integrals to generalize this approach to handle even more
general geometric shapes.

Preview Activity 11.2.1 Let f (x, y) = 25-x2-y2 on the rectangular domain
R = [-3, 3] × [-4, 4].

    As with partial derivatives, we may treat one of the variables in f as con-
stant and think of the resulting function as a function of a single variable. Now
we investigate what happens if we integrate instead of differentiate.

What is the geometric meaning of the value of A(x) relative to the surface
defined by f . (Hint: Think about the trace determined by the fixed
value of x, and consider how A(x) is related to the image at left in
Figure 11.2.2.)

c. Since f is continuous on R, we can define the function A = A(x) at every

   value of x in [-3, 3]. Now think about subdividing the x-interval [-3, 3]
   into m subintervals, and choosing a value xi in each of those subintervals.
   What will be the meaning of the sum i=1 m A(xi) x?

11.2.1 Iterated Integrals

The ideas that we explored in Preview Activity 11.2.1 work more generally and
lead to the idea of an iterated integral. Let f be a continuous function on a
rectangular domain R = [a, b] × [c, d], and let

                                                            d

                                         A(x) = f (x, y) dy.

                                                          c

    The function A = A(x) determines the value of the cross sectional area (by
area we mean "signed" area) in the y direction for the fixed value of x of the
solid bounded between the surface defined by f and the xy-plane.

Figure 11.2.3 Summing volumes of cross section slices.

The value of this cross sectional area is determined by the input x in A.

Since A is a function of x, it follows that we can integrate A with respect to

x. In doing so, we use a partition of [a, b] and make an approximation to the

integral given by

                                         b        m

                                            A(x) dx  A(xi )x,

                                      a           i=1

where xi is any number in the subinterval [xi-1, xi]. Each term A(xi )x in the
sum represents an approximation of a fixed cross sectional slice of the surface

in the y direction with a fixed width of x as illustrated in Figure 11.2.3. We

add the signed volumes of these slices as shown in the frames in Figure 11.2.3

to obtain an approximation of the total signed volume.

As we let the number of subintervals in the x direction approach infinity,

we can see that the Riemann sum             m     A(xi )x               approaches  a   limit  and  that
                                            i=1

limit is the sum of signed volumes bounded by the function f on R. Therefore,

since A(x) is itself determined by an integral, we have

                                   m                 b                     b   d

f (x, y) dA = lim A(xi )x = A(x) dx =                                            f (x, y) dy dx.
R m i=1

    Hence, we can compute the double integral of f over R by first integrating
f with respect to y on [c, d], then integrating the resulting function of x with
respect to x on [a, b]. The nested integral

                      b     d                           bd

                                   f (x, y) dy dx =                     f (x, y) dy dx

                   a     c                              ac

is called an iterated integral, and we see that each double integral may be
represented by two single integrals.
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                                213

    We made a choice to integrate first with respect to y. The same argu-
ment shows that we can also find the double integral as an iterated integral
integrating with respect to x first, or

                     d    b                    db

   f (x, y) dA =            f (x, y) dx  dy =      f (x, y) dx dy.

    The fact that integrating in either order results in the same value is known
as Fubini's Theorem.

                         Fubini's Theorem.

If f = f (x, y) is a continuous function on a rectangle R = [a, b] × [c, d],
then

                         db                    bd

      f (x, y) dA =          f (x, y) dx dy =      f (x, y) dy dx.

   R                     ca                    ac

    Fubini's theorem enables us to evaluate iterated integrals without resorting
to the limit definition. Instead, working with one integral at a time, we can
use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus from single-variable calculus to find
the exact value of each integral, starting with the inner integral.

Activity 11.2.2 Let f (x, y) = 25 - x2 - y2 on the rectangular domain R =
[-3, 3] × [-4, 4].

   a. Viewing x as a fixed constant, use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
       to evaluate the integral

                                                                             4

                                        A(x) = f (x, y) dy.

                                                                           -4

       Note that you will be integrating with respect to y, and holding x con-
       stant. Your result should be a function of x only.

   b. Next, use your result from (a) along with the Fundamental Theorem of

                                                                                3

       Calculus to determine the value of -3 A(x) dx.

   c. What is the value of R f (x, y) dA? What are two different ways we may
       interpret the meaning of this value?

Activity 11.2.3 Let f (x, y) = x + y2 on the rectangle R = [0, 2] × [0, 3].

   a. Evaluate R f (x, y) dA using an iterated integral. Choose an order for
       integration by deciding whether you want to integrate first with respect
       to x or y.

   b. Evaluate R f (x, y) dA using the iterated integral whose order of inte-
       gration is the opposite of the order you chose in (a).

11.2.2 Summary

· We can evaluate the double integral R f (x, y) dA over a rectangle R =
   [a, b] × [c, d] as an iterated integral in one of two ways:

       b  d              dx, or
                         dy.
a         c f (x, y) dy

c         a f (x, y) dx
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                               214

    This process works because each inner integral represents a cross-sectional
    (signed) area and the outer integral then sums all of the cross-sectional
    (signed) areas. Fubini's Theorem guarantees that the resulting value is
    the same, regardless of the order in which we integrate.

11.3 Double Integrals over General Regions

Motivating Questions

   · How do we define a double integral over a non-rectangular region?

   · What general form does an iterated integral over a non-rectangular region
       have?

    Recall that we defined the double integral of a continuous function f =
f (x, y) over a rectangle R = [a, b] × [c, d] as

                   nm

f (x, y) dA = lim               f (xij , yij ) · A,
R m,n j=1 i=1

where the notation is as described in Section 11.1. Furthermore, we have seen
that we can evaluate a double integral R f (x, y) dA over R as an iterated
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                              216

integral of either of the forms

       bd                                      db

              f (x, y) dy dx or                       f (x, y) dx dy.

      ac                                      ca

    It is natural to wonder how we might define and evaluate a double integral
over a non-rectangular region; we explore one such example in the following
preview activity.

Preview Activity 11.3.1 A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional figure with
four faces, each of which is a triangle. A picture of the tetrahedron T with
vertices (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1) is shown at left in Figure 11.3.1.
If we place one vertex at the origin and let vectors a, b, and c be determined
by the edges of the tetrahedron that have one end at the origin, then a formula
that tells us the volume V of the tetrahedron is

                                       1                               (11.3.1)
                                 V = |a · (b × c)|.

Figure 11.3.1 Left: The tetrahedron T . Right: Projecting T onto the xy-
plane.

a. Use the formula (11.3.1) to find the volume of the tetrahedron T .

b. Instead of memorizing or looking up the formula for the volume of a
    tetrahedron, we can use a double integral to calculate the volume of the
    tetrahedron T . To see how, notice that the top face of the tetrahedron
    T is the plane whose equation is

                                 z = 1 - (x + y).

Provided that we can use an iterated integral on a non-rectangular region,

the volume of the tetrahedron will be given by an iterated integral of the

form  x=? y=?

                                 1 - (x + y) dy dx.

      x=? y=?

The issue that is new here is how we find the limits on the integrals;
note that the outer integral's limits are in x, while the inner ones are in
y, since we have chosen dA = dy dx. To see the domain over which we
need to integrate, think of standing way above the tetrahedron looking
straight down on it, which means we are projecting the entire tetrahedron
onto the xy-plane. The resulting domain is the triangular region shown
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                            217

at right in Figure 11.3.1. Explain why we can represent the triangular
region with the inequalities

            0  y  1 - x and 0  x  1.

(Hint: Consider the cross sectional slice shown at right in Figure 11.3.1.)

c. Explain why it makes sense to now write the volume integral in the form

       x=?   y=?                        x=1   y=1-x
      x=?                              x=0
                  1 - (x + y) dy dx =                 1 - (x + y) dy dx.

            y=?                              y=0

d. Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the iterated inte-

gral

            x=1 y=1-x

                       1 - (x + y) dy dx

            x=0 y=0

and compare to your result from part (a). (As with iterated integrals
over rectangular regions, start with the inner integral.)

11.3.1 Double Integrals over General Regions

So far, we have learned that a double integral over a rectangular region may
be interpreted in one of two ways:

   · R f (x, y) dA tells us the volume of the solids the graph of f bounds
       above the xy-plane over the rectangle R minus the volume of the solids
       the graph of f bounds below the xy-plane under the rectangle R;

   · A(R) 1 R f (x, y) dA, where A(R) is the area of R tells us the average
       value of the function f on R. If f (x, y)  0 on R, we can interpret this
       average value of f on R as the height of the box with base R that has
       the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by f over R.

    As we saw in Preview Activity 11.1.1, a function f = f (x, y) may be consid-
ered over regions other than rectangular ones, and thus we want to understand
how to set up and evaluate double integrals over non-rectangular regions. Note
that if we can, then the two interpretations of the double integral noted above
will naturally extend to solid regions with non-rectangular bases.

    So, suppose f is a continuous function on a closed, bounded domain D.
For example, consider D as the circular domain shown at left in Figure 11.3.2.
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                                 218

            -2                                            -2

Figure 11.3.2 Left: A non-rectangular domain. Right: Enclosing this domain
in a rectangle.

    We can enclose D in a rectangular domain R as shown at right in Fig-

ure 11.3.2 and extend the function f to be defined over R in order to be able

to use the definition of the double integral over a rectangle. We extend f in

such a way that its values at the points in R that are not in D contribute 0 to

the value of the integral. In other words, define a function F = F (x, y) on R

as

                                      f (x, y),  if (x, y)  D,
                       F (x, y) =                                 .

                                      0,         if (x, y)  D

    We then say that the double integral of f over D is the same as the double
integral of F over R, and thus

                          f (x, y) dA = F (x, y) dA.

                       D                         R

    In practice, we just ignore everything that is in R but not in D, since these
regions contribute 0 to the value of the integral.

    Just as with double integrals over rectangles, a double integral over a do-
main D can be evaluated as an iterated integral. If the region D can be de-
scribed by the inequalities g1(x)  y  g2(x) and a  x  b, where g1 = g1(x)
and g2 = g2(x) are functions of only x, then

                      f (x, y) dA =    x=b        y =g2 (x)
                                      x=a
                    D                                      f (x, y) dy dx.

                                                 y =g1 (x)

    Alternatively, if the region D is described by the inequalities h1(y)  x 

h2(y) and c  y  d, where h1 = h1(y) and h2 = h2(y) are functions of only

y, we have

                                      y=d x=h2(y)

                       f (x, y) dA =                   f (x, y) dx dy.

                    D                 y=c x=h1(y)

    The structure of an iterated integral is of particular note:
    In an iterated double integral:

    · the limits on the outer integral must be constants;

    · the limits on the inner integral must be constants or in terms of only the
       remaining variable -- that is, if the inner integral is with respect to y,
       then its limits may only involve x and constants, and vice versa.

    We next consider a detailed example.

Figure 11.3.4 A triangular domain and slices in the y and x directions.

    To evaluate D f (x, y) dA, we must first describe the region D in terms of
the variables x and y. We take two approaches.

Approach 1: Integrate first with respect to y. In this case we choose to
       evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral in the form

                            x2y dA =         x=b    y =g2 (x)
                                            x=a
                          D                                  x2y dy dx,

                                                   y =g1 (x)

    and therefore we need to describe D in terms of inequalities

                    g1(x)  y  g2(x) and a  x  b.

    Since we are integrating with respect to y first, the iterated integral has

    the form                                          x=b

                                         x2y dA =          A(x) dx,

                                      D            x=a

    where A(x) is a cross sectional area in the y direction. So we are slicing

    the domain perpendicular to the x-axis and want to understand what a

    cross sectional area of the overall solid will look like. Several slices of the

    domain are shown in the middle image in Figure 11.3.4. On a slice with

    fixed x value, the y values are bounded below by 0 and above by the y

    coordinate on the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Thus, g1(x) = 0; to
    find y = g2(x), we need to write the hypotenuse as a function of x. The
    hypotenuse connects the points (0,0) and (2,3) and hence has equation
    y = 32 x. This gives the upper bound on y as g2(x) = 32 x. The leftmost
    vertical cross section is at x = 0 and the rightmost one is at x = 2, so we

    have a = 0 and b = 2. Therefore,

                                             x=2      y  =  3  x
                                            x=0             2
                               x2y dA =                           x2y dy dx.

                             D                        y=0

    We evaluate the iterated integral by applying the Fundamental Theorem
    of Calculus first to the inner integral, and then to the outer one, and find
    that

                  x=2     y  =  3  x                x=2        x2 · y2  y  =  3  x
                 x=0            2                  x=0               2        2
                                      x2y dy dx =
                                                                                    dx

                       y=0                                              y=0

                                            =       x=2 9 x4 dx

                                   5

Approach 2: Integrate first with respect to x. In this case, we choose to
       evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral in the form

                     x2y dA =   y=d       x=h2 (y )
                               y=c
                   D                                x2y dx dy

                                         x=h1 (y )

and thus need to describe D in terms of inequalities

          h1(y)  x  h2(y) and c  y  d.

Since we are integrating with respect to x first, the iterated integral has

the form                                              d

                               x2y dA = A(y) dy,

                            D            c

where A(y) is a cross sectional area of the solid in the x direction. Several

slices of the domain -- perpendicular to the y-axis -- are shown at right

in Figure 11.3.4. On a slice with fixed y value, the x values are bounded

below by the x coordinate on the hypotenuse of the right triangle and

above by 2. So h2(y) = 2; to find h1(y), we need to write the hypotenuse
as a function of y. Solving the earlier equation we have for the hypotenuse
(y = 32 x) for x gives us x = 23 y. This makes h1(y) = 23 y. The lowest
horizontal cross section is at y = 0 and the uppermost one is at y = 3,

so we have c = 0 and d = 3. Therefore,

                     x2y dA =   y=3       x=2
                               y=0
                   D                               x2y dx dy.

                                         x=(2/3)y

We evaluate the resulting iterated integral as before by twice applying
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and find that

           y=3  2                         y=3  x3 x=2
          y=0                            y=0                 y dx

                                   5

    We see, of course, that in the situation where D can be described in two
different ways, the order in which we choose to set up and evaluate the double
integral doesn't matter, and the same value results in either case.
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                        221

    The meaning of a double integral over a non-rectangular region, D, parallels
the meaning over a rectangular region. In particular,

   · D f (x, y) dA tells us the volume of the solids the graph of f bounds
       above the xy-plane over the closed, bounded region D minus the volume
       of the solids the graph of f bounds below the xy-plane under the region
       D;

   · A(D) 1 R f (x, y) dA, where A(D) is the area of D tells us the average
       value of the function f on D. If f (x, y)  0 on D, we can interpret
       this average value of f on D as the height of the solid with base D and
       constant cross-sectional area D that has the same volume as the volume
       of the surface defined by f over D.

11.3.2 Summary

· For a double integral D f (x, y) dA over a non-rectangular region D, we
   enclose D in a rectangle R and then extend integrand f to a function

F so that F (x, y) = 0 at all points in R outside of D and F (x, y) =

f (x, y) for all points in D. We then define                              D f (x, y) dA to be equal to
  R F (x, y) dA.

· In an iterated double integral, the limits on the outer integral must be
   constants while the limits on the inner integral must be constants or in
   terms of only the remaining variable. In other words, an iterated double
   integral has one of the following forms (which result in the same value):

                   x=b   y =g2 (x)
                  x=a
                                  f (x, y) dy dx,

                        y =g1 (x)

where g1 = g1(x) and g2 = g2(x) are functions of x only and the region
D is described by the inequalities g1(x)  y  g2(x) and a  x  b or

                   y=d   x=h2 (y )
                  y=c
                                   f (x, y) dx dy,

                        x=h1 (y )

where h1 = h1(y) and h2 = h2(y) are functions of y only and the region
D is described by the inequalities h1(y)  x  h2(y) and c  y  d.

11.4 Applications of Double Integrals

Motivating Questions

   · If we have a mass density function for a lamina (thin plate), how does a
       double integral determine the mass of the lamina?

· How may a double integral be used to find the area between two curves?

· Given a mass density function on a lamina, how can we find the lamina's
   center of mass?

· What is a joint probability density function? How do we determine the
   probability of an event if we know a probability density function?

So far, we have interpreted the double integral of a function f over a do-

main D in two different ways. First, D f (x, y) dA tells us a difference of
volumes -- the volume the surface defined by f bounds above the xy-plane on

D minus the volume the surface bounds below the xy-plane on D. In addition,

   1     D f (x, y) dA determines the average value of f on D. In this section, we
A(D)

investigate several other applications of double integrals, using the integration

process as seen in Preview Activity 11.4.1: we partition into small regions,

approximate the desired quantity on each small region, then use the integral

to sum these values exactly in the limit.

The following preview activity explores how a double integral can be used to

determine the density of a thin plate with a mass density distribution. Recall

that in single-variable calculus, we considered a similar problem and computed

the mass of a one-dimensional rod with a mass-density distribution. There, as

here, the key idea is that if density is constant, mass is the product of density

and volume.

Preview Activity 11.4.1 Suppose that we have a flat, thin object (called a
lamina) whose density varies across the object. We can think of the density
on a lamina as a measure of mass per unit area. As an example, consider a
circular plate D of radius 1 cm centered at the origin whose density  varies
depending on the distance from its center so that the density in grams per
square centimeter at point (x, y) is

                                  (x, y) = 10 - 2(x2 + y2).

a. Suppose that we partition the plate into subrectangles Rij, where 1 

      i    m    and  1     j      n,  of  equal  area  A,   and  select  a  point   (  x       ,  yij  )  in
                                                                                           ij
                                                                                              yij
      Rij  for  each  i  and  j.  What    is  the  meaning  of  the  quantity    (  x  ij  ,       )A     ?

b. State a double Riemann sum that provides an approximation of the mass
    of the plate.

c. Explain why the double integral

                                                (x, y) dA

                                                                 D

    tells us the exact mass of the plate.

d. Determine an iterated integral which, if evaluated, would give the exact
    mass of the plate. Do not actually evaluate the integral. (This integral is
    considerably easier to evaluate in polar coordinates, which we will learn
    more about in Section 11.5.)
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS           228

11.4.1 Mass

Density is a measure of some quantity per unit area or volume. For example,
we can measure the human population density of some region as the number
of humans in that region divided by the area of that region. In physics, the
mass density of an object is the mass of the object per unit area or volume.
As suggested by Preview Activity 11.4.1, the following holds in general.

                                  The mass of a lamina.

    If (x, y) describes the density of a lamina defined by a planar region
    D, then the mass of D is given by the double integral D (x, y) dA.

Activity 11.4.2 Let D be a half-disk lamina of radius 3 in quadrants IV and
I, centered at the origin as shown in Figure 11.4.1. Assume the density at point
(x, y) is given by (x, y) = x + y. Find the exact mass of the lamina.

11.4.2 Area

If we consider the situation where the mass-density distribution is constant,
we can also see how a double integral may be used to determine the area of
a region. Assuming that (x, y) = 1 over a closed bounded region D, where
the units of  are "mass per unit of area," it follows that D 1 dA is the mass
of the lamina. But since the density is constant, the numerical value of the
integral is simply the area.

    As the following activity demonstrates, we can also see this fact by consid-
ering a three-dimensional solid whose height is always 1.

Activity 11.4.3 Suppose we want to find the area of the bounded region D
between the curves

                             y = 1 - x2 and y = x - 1.

    A picture of this region is shown in Figure 11.4.2.

   a. The volume of a solid with constant height is given by the area of the
       base times the height. Hence, we may interpret the area of the region D
       as the volume of a solid with base D and of uniform height 1. That is, the
       area of D is given by D 1 dA. Write an iterated integral whose value
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS         229

is D 1 dA. (Hint: Which order of integration might be more efficient?

   b. Evaluate the iterated integral from (a). What does the result tell you?
    We now formally state the conclusion from our earlier discussion and Ac-
tivity 11.4.3.

                            The double integral and area.

    Given a closed, bounded region D in the plane, the area of D, denoted
    A(D), is given by the double integral

                                       A(D) = 1 dA.

                                                                             D

11.4.3 Center of Mass

The center of mass of an object is a point at which the object will balance
perfectly. For example, the center of mass of a circular disk of uniform density
is located at its center. For any object, if we throw it through the air, it will
spin around its center of mass and behave as if all the mass is located at the
center of mass.

    In order to understand the role that integrals play in determining the center
of a mass of an object with a nonuniform mass distribution, we start by finding
the center of mass of a collection of N distinct point-masses in the plane.

    Let m1, m2, . . ., mN be N masses located in the plane. Think of these
masses as connected by rigid rods of negligible weight from some central point
(x, y). A picture with four masses is shown in Figure 11.4.3. Now imagine bal-
ancing this system by placing it on a thin pole at the point (x, y) perpendicular
to the plane containing the masses. Unless the masses are perfectly balanced,
the system will fall off the pole. The point (x, y) at which the system will
balance perfectly is called the center of mass of the system. Our goal is to
determine the center of mass of a system of discrete masses, then extend this
to a continuous lamina.

Figure 11.4.3 A center of mass (x, y) of four masses.

    Each mass exerts a force (called a moment) around the lines x = x and
y = y that causes the system to tilt in the direction of the mass. These
moments are dependent on the mass and the distance from the given line. Let
(x1, y1) be the location of mass m1, (x2, y2) the location of mass m2, etc. In
order to balance perfectly, the moments in the x direction and in the y direction
must be in equilibrium. We determine these moments and solve the resulting
system to find the equilibrium point (x, y) at the center of mass.

    The force that mass m1 exerts to tilt the system from the line y = y is

                             m1g(y - y1),

where g is the gravitational constant. Similarly, the force mass m2 exerts to
tilt the system from the line y = y is

                             m2g(y - y2).

    In general, the force that mass mk exerts to tilt the system from the line
y = y is

                                          mkg(y - yk).

    For the system to balance, we need the forces to sum to 0, so that

                         N

                            mkg(y - yk) = 0.

                        k=1

Solving for y, we find that

                                 k=1 N mkyk
                             y= N            .
                                 k=1 mk

A similar argument shows that

                             x=  k=1 N mkxk .
                                  k=1 N mk

    The value Mx =      k=1 N mkyk is called the total moment with respect
to the x-axis; My =     k=1 N mkxk is the total moment with respect to the

y-axis. Hence, the respective quotients of the moments to the total mass, M ,

determines the center of mass of a point-mass system:

                        (x, y) = My , Mx .
                                      MM
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                                                            231

    Now, suppose that rather than a point-mass system, we have a continuous
lamina with a variable mass-density (x, y). We may estimate its center of
mass by partitioning the lamina into mn subrectangles of equal area A, and
treating the resulting partitioned lamina as a point-mass system. In particular,
we select a point (xij, yij) in the ijth subrectangle, and observe that the quanity

                                                   (  x      ,  yij  )A
                                                         ij

is  density  times  area,     so      (x      ,  yij  )         A  approximates  the  mass  of  the       small
                                          ij

portion of the lamina determined by the subrectangle Rij.

    We  now  treat    (x      ,  yij  )A         as   a      point   mass  at  the  point  (xij , yij ).  The
                          ij

coordinates (x, y) of the center of mass of these mn point masses are thus

given by

        j=1 i=1 n m xij (xij , yij )A                                      j=1 i=1 n m yij (xij , yij )A
j=1 i=1 x = n m (xij , yij )A                            and y = j=1 i=1 n m (xij , yij )A .

    If we take the limit as m and n go to infinity, we obtain the exact center
of mass (x, y) of the continuous lamina.

                          The center of mass of a lamina.

    The coordinates (x, y) of the center of mass of a lamina D with density
     = (x, y) are given by

             x = D x(x, y) dA and y = D y(x, y) dA .
                      D (x, y) dA                                              D (x, y) dA

    The center of mass of a lamina can then be thought of as a weighted average
of all of the points in the lamina with the weights given by the density at each
point. The centroid of a lamina is the just the average of all of the points in
the lamina, or the center of mass if the density at each point is 1.

    The numerators of x and y are called the respective moments of the lamina
about the coordinate axes. Thus, the moment of a lamina D with density
 = (x, y) about the y-axis is

                                    My = x(x, y) dA

                                                                      D

and the moment of D about the x-axis is

                                    Mx = y(x, y) dA.

                                                                     D

    If M is the mass of the lamina, it follows that the center of mass is

                                     (x, y) = My , Mx .
                                                   MM

Activity 11.4.4 In this activity we determine integrals that represent the
center of mass of a lamina D described by the triangular region bounded by
the x-axis and the lines x = 1 and y = 2x in the first quadrant if the density
at point (x, y) is (x, y) = 6x + 6y + 6. A picture of the lamina is shown in

11.4.4 Probability

Calculating probabilities is a very important application of integration in the

physical, social, and life sciences. To understand the basics, consider the game

of darts in which a player throws a dart at a board and tries to hit a particular

target. Let us suppose that a dart board is in the form of a disk D with radius

10 inches. If we assume that a player throws a dart at random, and is not

aiming at any particular point, then it is equally probable that the dart will

strike any single point on the board. For instance, the probability that the dart

will strike a particular 1 square inch region is 100 1 , or the ratio of the area
of the desired target to the total area of D (assuming that the dart thrower

always hits the board itself at some point). Similarly, the probability that the

dart strikes a point in the disk D3 of radius 3 inches is given by the area of D3

divided by the area of D. In other words, the probability that the dart strikes

the disk D3 is       9              1
                           =             dA.

                    100       D3 100

    The integrand, 100 1 , may be thought of as a distribution function, describ-
ing how the dart strikes are distributed across the board. In this case the
distribution function is constant since we are assuming a uniform distribution,
but we can easily envision situations where the distribution function varies. For
example, if the player is fairly good and is aiming for the bulls eye (the center
of D), then the distribution function f could be skewed toward the center, say

                    f (x, y) = Ke-(x2+y2)

for some constant positive K. If we assume that the player is consistent enough
so that the dart always strikes the board, then the probability that the dart
strikes the board somewhere is 1, and the distribution function f will have to

satisfy1

                                            f (x, y) dA = 1.

                                                            D

    For such a function f , the probability that the dart strikes in the disk D1
of radius 1 would be

                                                f (x, y) dA.

                                                               D1

    Indeed, the probability that the dart strikes in any region R that lies within
D is given by

                                               f (x, y) dA.

                                                                R

    The preceding discussion highlights the general idea behind calculating
probabilities. We assume we have a joint probability density function f , a
function of two independent variables x and y defined on a domain D that
satisfies the conditions

   · f (x, y)  0 for all x and y in D,

   · the probability that x is between some values a and b while y is between
       some values c and d is given by

                                                                bd

                                                   f (x, y) dy dx,

                                                              ac

   · The probability that the point (x, y) is in D is 1, that is

                       f (x, y) dA = 1.                     (11.4.1)

                     D

    Note that it is possible that D could be an infinite region and the limits
on the integral in Equation (11.4.1) could be infinite. When we have such a
probability density function f = f (x, y), the probability that the point (x, y)
is in some region R contained in the domain D (the notation we use here is
"P ((x, y)  R)") is determined by

                     P ((x, y)  R) = f (x, y) dA.

Activity 11.4.5 A firm manufactures smoke detectors. Two components for

the detectors come from different suppliers -- one in Michigan and one in Ohio.

The company studies these components for their reliability and their data

suggests that if x is the life span (in years) of a randomly chosen component

from the Michigan supplier and y the life span (in years) of a randomly chosen

component from the Ohio supplier, then the joint probability density function

f might be given by

                     f (x, y) = e-xe-y.

a. Theoretically, the components might last forever, so the domain D of the
    function f is the set D of all (x, y) such that x  0 and y  0. To show
    that f is a probability density function on D we need to demonstrate
    that

                                              f (x, y) dA = 1,

Use your knowledge of improper integrals to verify that f is indeed a
probability density function.

b. Assume that the smoke detector fails only if both of the supplied compo-
    nents fail. To determine the probability that a randomly selected detector
    will fail within one year, we will need to determine the probability that
    the life span of each component is between 0 and 1 years. Set up an
    appropriate iterated integral, and evaluate the integral to determine the
    probability.

c. What is the probability that a randomly chosen smoke detector will fail
   between years 3 and 7?

d. Suppose that the manufacturer determines that one of the components is
    more likely to fail than the other, and hence conjectures that the proba-
    bility density function is instead f (x, y) = Ke-xe-2y. What is the value
    of K?

11.5 Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates

Motivating Questions

   · What are the polar coordinates of a point in two-space?

· How do we convert between polar coordinates and rectangular coordi-
   nates?

· What is the area element in polar coordinates?

· How do we convert a double integral in rectangular coordinates to a
   double integral in polar coordinates?

    While we have naturally defined double integrals in the rectangular coor-
dinate system, starting with domains that are rectangular regions, there are
many of these integrals that are difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate. For
example, consider the domain D that is the unit circle and f (x, y) = e-x2-y2 .
To integrate f over D, we would use the iterated integral

      f (x, y) dA =        x=1        
                          x=-1   y= 1-x2
    D
                                      e-x2-y2 dy dx.

                                y=- 1-x2

    For this particular integral, regardless of the order of integration, we are
unable to find an antiderivative of the integrand; in addition, even if we were
able to find an antiderivative, the inner limits of integration involve relatively
complicated functions.

    It is useful, therefore, to be able to translate to other coordinate systems
where the limits of integration and evaluation of the involved integrals is sim-
pler. In this section we provide a quick discussion of one such system -- polar
coordinates -- and then introduce and investigate their ramifications for dou-
ble integrals. The rectangular coordinate system allows us to consider domains
and graphs relative to a rectangular grid. The polar coordinate system is an
alternate coordinate system that allows us to consider domains less suited to
rectangular coordinates, such as circles.

Preview Activity 11.5.1 The coordinates of a point determine its location.
In particular, the rectangular coordinates of a point P are given by an ordered
pair (x, y), where x is the (signed) distance the point lies from the y-axis to
P and y is the (signed) distance the point lies from the x-axis to P . In polar
coordinates, we locate the point by considering the distance the point lies from
the origin, O = (0, 0), and the angle the line segment from the origin to P
forms with the positive x-axis.

   a. Determine the rectangular coordinates of the following points:

(a) The point P that lies 1 unit from the origin on the positive x-axis.

(b) The point Q that lies 2 units from the origin and such that OQ

makes  an  angle   of     with  the  positive  x-axis.
                       2

(c) The point R that lies 3 units from the origin such that OR makes

an  angle  of  2   with   the  positive  x-axis.

b. Part (a) indicates that the two pieces of information completely deter-
    mine the location of a point: either the traditional (x, y) coordinates, or
    alternately, the distance r from the point to the origin along with the
    angle  that the line through the origin and the point makes with the
    positive x-axis. We write "(r, )" to denote the point's location in its
    polar coordinate representation. Find polar coordinates for the points
    with the given rectangular coordinates.

       i. (0, -1) ii. (-2, 0) iii. (-1, 1)

c. For each of the following points whose coordinates are given in polar
    form, determine the rectangular coordinates of the point.

11.5.1 Polar Coordinates

The rectangular coordinate system is best suited for graphs and regions that
are naturally considered over a rectangular grid. The polar coordinate system
is an alternative that offers good options for functions and domains that have
more circular characteristics. A point P in rectangular coordinates that is
described by an ordered pair (x, y), where x is the displacement from P to
the y-axis and y is the displacement from P to the x-axis, as seen in Preview
Activity 11.5.1, can also be described with polar coordinates (r, ), where r is
the distance from P to the origin and  is the angle formed by the line segment
OP and the positive x-axis, as shown at left in Figure 11.5.1.

· If we are given the rectangular coordinates (x, y) of a point P ,
   then the polar coordinates (r, ) of P satisfy

          r = x2 + y2  and              y
                            tan() = , assuming x = 0.

· If we are given the polar coordinates (r, ) of a point P , then the
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                      239

rectangular coordinates (x, y) of P satisfy
                  x = r cos() and y = r sin().

    Note: The angle  in the polar coordinates of a point is not unique. We
could replace  with  +2 and still be at the same terminal point. In addition,
the sign of tan() does not uniquely determine the quadrant in which  lies, so
we have to determine the value of  from the location of the point. In other
words, more care has to be paid when using polar coordinates than rectangular
coordinates.

    We can draw graphs of curves in polar coordinates in a similar way to how
we do in rectangular coordinates. However, when plotting in polar coordinates,
we use a grid that considers changes in angles and changes in distance from
the origin. In particular, the angles  and distances r partition the plane into
small wedges as shown at right in Figure 11.5.1.

Activity 11.5.2 Most polar graphing devices can plot curves in polar coordi-
nates of the form r = f (). Use such a device to complete this activity.

   a. Before plotting the polar curve r = 1 (where  can have any value), think
       about what shape it should have, in light of how r is connected to x and
       y. Then use appropriate technology to draw the graph and test your
       intuition.

   b. The equation  = 1 does not define r as a function of , so we can't graph
       this equation on many polar plotters. What do you think the graph of
       the polar curve  = 1 looks like? Why?

   c. Before plotting the polar curve r = , what do you think the graph looks
       like? Why? Use technology to plot the curve and compare your intuition.

   d. What does the region defined by 1  r  3 (where  can have any value)
       look like? (Hint: Compare to your response from part (a).)

   e. What does the region defined by 1  r  3 and /4    /2 look like?

    f. Consider the curve r = sin(). For some values of  we will have r < 0.
       In these situations, we plot the point (r, ) as (|r|,  + ) (in other words,
       when r < 0, we reflect the point through the origin). With that in mind,
       what do you think the graph of r = sin() looks like? Plot this curve
       using technology and compare to your intuition.

11.5.2 Integrating in Polar Coordinates

Consider the double integral

  ex2+y2 dA,

D

where D is the unit disk. While we cannot directly evaluate this integral in
rectangular coordinates, a change to polar coordinates will convert it to one
we can easily evaluate.

    We have seen how to evaluate a double integral    f (x, y) dA as an iter-
ated integral of the form
                                                    D

 b g2(x)

            f (x, y) dy dx

a g1(x)
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS            240

in rectangular coordinates, because we know that dA = dy dx in rectangular
coordinates. To make the change to polar coordinates, we not only need to
represent the variables x and y in polar coordinates, but we also must under-
stand how to write the area element, dA, in polar coordinates. That is, we
must determine how the area element dA can be written in terms of dr and d
in the context of polar coordinates. We address this question in the following
activity.

      ri+1                      ri+1
ri                                    ri

           j+1
      j

Figure 11.5.2 Left: A polar rectangle. Right: An annulus.

Activity 11.5.3 Consider a polar rectangle R, with r between ri and ri+1 and
 between j and j+1 as shown at left in Figure 11.5.2. Let r = ri+1 - ri
and  = j+1 - j. Let A be the area of this region.

   a. Explain why the area A in polar coordinates is not r .

   b. Now find A by the following steps:

           i. Find the area of the annulus (the washer-like region) between ri and
              ri+1, as shown at right in Figure 11.5.2. This area will be in terms
              of ri and ri+1.

          ii. Observe that the region R is only a portion of the annulus, so the
              area A of R is only a fraction of the area of the annulus. For
              instance, if i+1 - i were 4 , then the resulting wedge would be

                                                      4 = 1
                                                     2 8

              of the entire annulus. In this more general context, using the wedge
              between the two noted angles, what fraction of the area of the an-
              nulus is the area A?

         iii. Write an expression for A in terms of ri, ri+1, j, and j+1.
         iv. Finally, write the area A in terms of ri, ri+1, r, and , where

              each quantity appears only once in the expression. (Hint: Think
              about how to factor a difference of squares.)

   c. As we take the limit as r and  go to 0, r becomes dr,  becomes
       d, and A becomes dA, the area element. Using your work in (iv), write
       dA in terms of r, dr, and d.

    From the result of Activity 11.5.3, we see when we convert an integral from
rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we must not only convert x and
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                     241

y to being in terms of r and , but we also have to change the area element
to dA = r dr d in polar coordinates. As we saw in Activity 11.5.3, the reason
the additional factor of r in the polar area element is due to the fact that
in polar coordinates, the cross sectional area element increases as r increases,
while the cross sectional area element in rectangular coordinates is constant.
So, given a double integral D f (x, y) dA in rectangular coordinates, to write a
corresponding iterated integral in polar coordinates, we replace x with r cos(),
y with r sin() and dA with r dr d. Of course, we need to describe the region
D in polar coordinates as well. To summarize:

                      Double integrals in polar coordinates.

    The double integral D f (x, y) dA in rectangular coordinates can be
    converted to a double integral in polar coordinates as D f (r cos(), r sin()) r dr d.

Example 11.5.3 Let f (x, y) = ex2+y2 on the disk D = {(x, y) : x2 + y2  1}.

We will evaluate D f (x, y) dA.                     D f (x, y) dA can be written
    In rectangular coordinates the double integral

as the iterated integral

          f (x, y) dA =   x=1          
                         x=-1     y= 1-x2
        D
                                       ex2+y2 dy dx.

                                 y=- 1-x2

We cannot evaluate this iterated integral, because ex2+y2 does not have

an elementary antiderivative with respect to either x or y. However, since

r2 = x2 + y2 and the region D is circular, it is natural to wonder whether

converting to polar coordinates will allow us to evaluate the new integral. To

do so, we replace x with r cos(), y with r sin(), and dy dx with r dr d to

obtain

                  f (x, y) dA =         er2 r dr d.

             D                       D

    The disc D is described in polar coordinates by the constraints 0  r  1
and 0    2. Therefore, it follows that

          er2 r dr d =    =2          r=1 er2 r dr d.
                         =0
        D                            r=0

We can evaluate the resulting iterated polar integral as follows:

         =2  er r=1 2 2 r dr d = 1 er2 r=1 d
        =0                        =0 2
             r=0                                    r=0

                               =  1 =2              (e - 1) d

                                  2 =0

                                  1 =2
                               = (e - 1)                 d
                                  2
                                                    =0

                                  1 =2
                               = (e - 1) []
                                  2
                                                    =0

                               = (e - 1).

    While there is no firm rule for when polar coordinates can or should be
used, they are a natural alternative anytime the domain of integration may be
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                               242

expressed simply in polar form, and/or when the integrand involves expressions
such as x2 + y2.

Activity 11.5.4 Let f (x, y) = x + y and D = {(x, y) : x2 + y2  4}.
   a. Sketch the region D and then write the double integral of f over D as
       an iterated integral in rectangular coordinates.

   b. Write the double integral of f over D as an iterated integral in polar
       coordinates.

   c. Evaluate one of the iterated integrals. Why is the final value you found
       not surprising?

Figure 11.5.4.

a. Determine a polar curve in the form r = f () that traces out the circle
   x2 + (y - 1)2 = 1. (Hint: Recall that a circle centered at the origin of

   radius r can be described by the equations x = r cos() and y = r sin().)

b. Find the exact average value of g(x, y) =  x2 + y2 over the interior of
    the circle x2 + (y - 1)2 = 1.

c. Find the volume under the surface h(x, y) = x over the region D, where
   D is the region bounded above by the line y = x and below by the circle
   (this is the shaded region in Figure 11.5.4).

· The polar representation of a point P is the ordered pair (r, ) where r
   is the distance from the origin to P and  is the angle the ray through
   the origin and P makes with the positive x-axis.

       the rectangular coordinates x and y of a point (r, ) in polar coordinates
       satisfy

                               x = r cos() and y = r sin().

    · The area element dA in polar coordinates is determined by the area of a

                                              dA = r dr d.

    · To convert the double integral D f (x, y) dA to an iterated integral in
       polar coordinates, we substitute r cos() for x, r sin() for y, and r dr d
       for dA to obtain the iterated integral

11.6 Surfaces Defined Parametrically and Sur-
       face Area

Motivating Questions

   · What is a parameterization of a surface?

   · How do we find the surface area of a parametrically defined surface?

    We have now studied at length how curves in space can be defined para-
metrically by functions of the form r(t) = x(t), y(t), z(t) , and surfaces can be
represented by functions z = f (x, y). In what follows, we will see how we can
also define surfaces parametrically. A one-dimensional curve in space results
from a vector function that relies upon one parameter, so a two-dimensional
surface naturally involves the use of two parameters. If x = x(s, t), y = y(s, t),
and z = z(s, t) are functions of independent parameters s and t, then the
terminal points of all vectors of the form

                            r(s, t) = x(s, t)i + y(s, t)j + z(s, t)k

form a surface in space. The equations x = x(s, t), y = y(s, t), and z = z(s, t)
are the parametric equations for the surface, or a parametrization of the surface.
In Preview Activity 11.6.1 we investigate how to parameterize a cylinder and
a cone.
Preview Activity 11.6.1 Recall the standard parameterization of the unit
circle that is given by

                           x(t) = cos(t) and y(t) = sin(t),

where 0  t  2.
   a. Determine a parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in R3 that has its
       center at (0, 0, 1) and lies in the plane z = 1.

   b. Determine a parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in 3-space that has
       its center at (0, 0, -1) and lies in the plane z = -1.

   c. Determine a parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in 3-space that has
       its center at (0, 0, 5) and lies in the plane z = 5.

   d. Taking into account your responses in (a), (b), and (c), describe the graph
       that results from the set of parametric equations

                  x(s, t) = cos(t), y(s, t) = sin(t), and z(s, t) = s,

       where 0  t  2 and -5  s  5. Explain your thinking.

   e. Just as a cylinder can be viewed as a "stack" of circles of constant radius,
       a cone can be viewed as a stack of circles with varying radius. Modify
       the parametrizations of the circles above in order to construct the param-
       eterization of a cone whose vertex lies at the origin, whose base radius
       is 4, and whose height is 3, where the base of the cone lies in the plane
       z = 3. Use appropriate technology to plot the parametric equations you
       develop. (Hint: The cross sections parallel to the xz-plane are circles,
       with the radii varying linearly as z increases.)
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS  250

11.6.1 Parametric Surfaces

In a single-variable setting, any function may have its graph expressed para-
metrically. For instance, given y = g(x), by considering the parameterization
 t, g(t) (where t belongs to the domain of g), we generate the same curve.
What is more important is that certain curves that are not functions may
be represented parametrically; for instance, the circle (which cannot be rep-
resented by a single function) can be parameterized by cos(t), sin(t) , where
0  t  2.

    In the same way, in a two-variable setting, the surface z = f (x, y) may be
expressed parametrically by considering

                            x(s, t), y(s, t), z(s, t) = s, t, f (s, t) ,

where (s, t) varies over the entire domain of f . Therefore, any familiar surface
that we have studied so far can be generated as a parametric surface. But what
is more powerful is that there are surfaces that cannot be generated by a single
function z = f (x, y) (such as the unit sphere), but that can be represented
parametrically. We now consider an important example.

Example 11.6.1 Consider the torus (or doughnut) shown in Figure 11.6.2.

    To find a parametrization of this torus, we recall our work in Preview
Activity 11.6.1. There, we saw that a circle of radius r that has its center at
the point (0, 0, z0) and is contained in the horizontal plane z = z0, as shown in
Figure 11.6.3, can be parametrized using the vector-valued function r defined
by

                              r(t) = r cos(t)i + r sin(t)j + z0k

    To obtain the torus in Figure 11.6.2, we begin with a circle of radius a
in the xz-plane centered at (b, 0), as shown on the left of Figure 11.6.4. We
may parametrize the points on this circle, using the parameter s, by using the
equations

                         x(s) = b + a cos(s) and z(s) = a sin(s),

where 0  s  2.

Figure 11.6.4 Revolving a circle to obtain a torus.
    Let's focus our attention on one point on this circle, such as the indicated

point, which has coordinates (x(s), 0, z(s)) for a fixed value of the parameter
s. When this point is revolved about the z-axis, we obtain a circle contained
in a horizontal plane centered at (0, 0, z(s)) and having radius x(s), as shown
on the right of Figure 11.6.4. If we let t be the new parameter that generates
the circle for the rotation about the z-axis, this circle may be parametrized by

                       r(s, t) = x(s) cos(t)i + x(s) sin(t)j + z(s)k.

    Now using our earlier parametric equations for x(s) and z(s) for the original
smaller circle, we have an overall parameterization of the torus given by

         r(s, t) = (b + a cos(s)) cos(t)i + (b + a cos(s)) sin(t)j + a sin(s)k.

    To trace out the entire torus, we require that the parameters vary through
the values 0  s  2 and 0  t  2.
Activity 11.6.2 In this activity, we seek a parametrization of the sphere of
radius R centered at the origin, as shown on the left in Figure 11.6.5. Notice
that this sphere may be obtained by revolving a half-circle contained in the
xz-plane about the z-axis, as shown on the right.

    Be sure to state the domain of the parameter s.

b. By revolving the points on this half-circle about the z-axis, obtain a
    parametrization r(s, t) of the points on the sphere of radius R. Be sure
    to include the domain of both parameters s and t. (Hint: What is the
    radius of the circle obtained when revolving a point on the half-circle
    around the z axis?)

    c. Draw the surface defined by your parameterization with appropriate tech-
       nology.

11.6.2 The Surface Area of Parametrically Defined Sur-
          faces

Recall that a differentiable function is locally linear -- that is, if we zoom in
on the surface around a point, the surface looks like its tangent plane. We
now exploit this idea in order to determine the surface area generated by a
parametrization x(s, t), y(s, t), z(s, t) . The basic idea is a familiar one: we
will subdivide the surface into small pieces, in the approximate shape of small
parallelograms, and thus estimate the entire the surface area by adding the
areas of these approximation parallelograms. Ultimately, we use an integral to
sum these approximations and determine the exact surface area.

    Let
                            r(s, t) = x(s, t)i + y(s, t)j + z(s, t)k

define a surface over a rectangular domain a  s  b and c  t  d. As
a function of two variables, s and t, it is natural to consider the two partial
derivatives of the vector-valued function r, which we define by

                    rs(s, t) = xs(s, t)i + ys(s, t)j + zs(s, t)k
                    rt(s, t) = xt(s, t)i + yt(s, t)j + zt(s, t)k.

    In the usual way, we slice the domain into small rectangles. In particular,

we  partition  the  interval  [a, b]  into  m  subintervals  of  length  s  =  b-a  and  let
                                                                                n

s0, s1, . . ., sm be the endpoints of these subintervals, where a = s0 < s1 <
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                                    253

s2 < · · · < sm = b. Also partition the interval [c, d] into n subintervals of equal

length  t  =  d-c  and  let  t0,  t1,  . . .,  tn  be  the  endpoints  of  these  subintervals,
               n

where c = t0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tn = d. These two partitions create a partition

of the rectangle R = [a, b] × [c, d] in st-coordinates into mn sub-rectangles Rij

with opposite vertices (si-1, tj-1) and (si, tj) for i between 1 and m and j

between 1 and n. These rectangles all have equal area A = s · t.

Now we want to think about the small piece of area on the surface itself

that lies above one of these small rectangles in the domain. Observe that if we

increase s by a small amount s from the point (si-1, tj-1) in the domain, then

r changes by approximately rs(si-1, tj-1)s. Similarly, if we increase t by a

small amount t from the point (si-1, tj-1), then r changes by approximately

rt(si-1, tj-1)t. So we can approximate the surface defined by r on the st-

rectangle [si-1, si] × [tj-1, tj] with the parallelogram determined by the vectors

rs(si-1, tj-1)s and rt(si-1, tj-1)t, as seen in Figure 11.6.6.

Figure 11.6.6 Approximation surface area with a parallelogram.

    Say that the small parallelogram has area Sij. If we can find its area, then
all that remains is to sum the areas of all of the generated parallelograms and
take a limit. Recall from our earlier work in the course that given two vectors
u and v, the area of the parallelogram spanned by u and v is given by the
magnitude of their cross product, |u×v|. In the present context, it follows that
the area, Sij, of the parallelogram determined by the vectors rs(si-1, tj-1)s
and rt(si-1, tj-1)t is

              Sij = |(rs(si-1, tj-1)s) × (rt(si-1, tj-1)t)|                       (11.6.1)
                  = |rs(si-1, tj-1) × rt(si-1, tj-1)|st,

where the latter equality holds from standard properties of the cross product
and length.

    We sum the surface area approximations from Equation (11.6.1) over all
sub-rectangles to obtain an estimate for the total surface area, S, given by

                   mn

              S              |rs(si-1, tj-1) × rt(si-1, tj-1)|st.

                   i=1 j=1

    Taking the limit as m, n   shows that the surface area of the surface
defined by r over the domain D is given as follows.

       sectional circle, then multiply by the height. Calculate the surface area
       of the given cylinder using this alternate approach, and compare your
       work in (b).

    As we noted earlier, we can take any surface z = f (x, y) and generate a
corresponding parameterization for the surface by writing s, t, f (s, t) . Hence,
we can use our recent work with parametrically defined surfaces to find the
surface area that is generated by a function f = f (x, y) over a given domain.

10. Consider the ellipsoid given by the equation

                                          x2 y2 z2
                                               + + = 1.

                                          16 25 9
           In Activity 11.6.2, we found that a parameterization of the sphere S
      of radius R centered at the origin is

x(r, s) = R cos(s) cos(t), y(s, t) = R cos(s) sin(t), and z(s, t) = R sin(s)

     a. Let (x, y, z) be a point on the ellipsoid and let X = x4 , Y = 5y , and
        Z = z3 . Show that (X, Y, Z) lies on the sphere S. Hence, find a
        parameterization of S in terms of X, Y , and Z as functions of s and

        t.

          b. Use the result of part (a) to find a parameterization of the ellipse in
              terms of x, y, and z as functions of s and t. Check your parametriza-
              tion by substituting x, y, and z into the equation of the ellipsoid.
              Then check your work by plotting the surface defined by your pa-
              rameterization.

11. In this exercise, we explore how to use a parametrization and iterated
      integral to determine the surface area of a sphere.

          a. Set up an iterated integral whose value is the portion of the surface
              area of a sphere of radius R that lies in the first octant (see the
              parameterization you developed in Activity 11.6.2).

b. Then, evaluate the integral to calculate the surface area of this por-
    tion of the sphere.

     c. By what constant must you multiply the value determined in (b) in
        order to find the total surface area of the entire sphere.

          d. Finally, compare your result to the standard formula for the surface
              area of sphere.

12. Consider the plane generated by z = f (x, y) = 24-2x-3y over the region
      D = [0, 2] × [0, 3].

          a. Sketch a picture of the overall solid generated by the plane over the
              given domain.

b. Determine a parameterization r(s, t) for the plane over the domain
    D.

     c. Use Equation (11.6.2) to determine the surface area generated by f
        over the domain D.

d. Observe that the vector u = 2, 0, -4 points from (0, 0, 24) to

         (2, 0, 20) along one side of the surface generated by the plane f

         over D. Find the vector v such that u and v together span the

         parallelogram that represents the surface defined by f over D, and

         hence compute |u × v|. What do you observe about the value you

         find?

11.7 Triple Integrals

Motivating Questions

   · How are a triple Riemann sum and the corresponding triple integral of a
       continuous function f = f (x, y, z) defined?

· What are two things the triple integral of a function can tell us?

    We have now learned that we define the double integral of a continuous
function f = f (x, y) over a rectangle R = [a, b] × [c, d] as a limit of a double
Riemann sum, and that these ideas parallel the single-variable integral of a
function g = g(x) on an interval [a, b]. Moreover, this double integral has
natural interpretations and applications, and can even be considered over non-
rectangular regions, D. For instance, given a continuous function f over a
region D, the average value of f , fAVG(D), is given by

                 1                f (x, y) dA,
fAVG(D) = A(D)
                                D

where A(D) is the area of D. Likewise, if (x, y) describes a mass density
function on a lamina over D, the mass, M , of the lamina is given by

                                     M = (x, y) dA.

                                                                     D

    It is natural to wonder if it is possible to extend these ideas of double
Riemann sums and double integrals for functions of two variables to triple
Riemann sums and then triple integrals for functions of three variables. We
begin investigating in Preview Activity 11.7.1.

Preview Activity 11.7.1 Consider a solid piece of granite in the shape of a
box B = {(x, y, z) : 0  x  4, 0  y  6, 0  z  8}, whose density varies
from point to point. Let (x, y, z) represent the mass density of the piece of
granite at point (x, y, z) in kilograms per cubic meter (so we are measuring x,
y, and z in meters). Our goal is to find the mass of this solid.

    Recall that if the density was constant, we could find the mass by multi-
plying the density and volume; since the density varies from point to point, we
will use the approach we did with two-variable lamina problems, and slice the
solid into small pieces on which the density is roughly constant.

    Partition the interval [0, 4] into 2 subintervals of equal length, the interval
[0, 6] into 3 subintervals of equal length, and the interval [0, 8] into 2 subin-
tervals of equal length. This partitions the box B into sub-boxes as shown in
Figure 11.7.1.

       and 0 = z0 < z1 < z2 = 8 What is the length x of each subinterval
       [xi-1, xi] for i from 1 to 2? the length of y? of z?

   b. The partitions of the intervals [0, 4], [0, 6] and [0, 8] partition the box B

   c. Let Bijk denote the sub-box [xi-1, xi] × [yj-1, yj] × [zk-1, zk]. Say that
       we choose a point (xijk, yijk, zijk) in the i, j, kth sub-box for each possible
       combination of i, j, k. What is the meaning of (xijk, yijk, zijk)? What
       physical quantity will (xijk, yijk, zijk)V approximate?

   d. What final step(s) would it take to determine the exact mass of the piece
       of granite?

11.7.1 Triple Riemann Sums and Triple Integrals

Through the application of a mass density distribution over a three-dimensional
solid, Preview Activity 11.7.1 suggests that the generalization from double
Riemann sums of functions of two variables to triple Riemann sums of functions
of three variables is natural. In the same way, so is the generalization from
double integrals to triple integrals. By simply adding a z-coordinate to our
earlier work, we can define both a triple Riemann sum and the corresponding
triple integral.

Definition 11.7.2 Let f = f (x, y, z) be a continuous function on a box B =
[a, b] × [c, d] × [r, s]. The triple Riemann sum of f over B is created as
follows.

· Partition the interval [a, b] into m subintervals of equal length x =

m b-a . Let x0, x1, . . ., xm be the endpoints of these subintervals, where

a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xm = b. Do likewise with the interval [c, d]

using  n  subintervals  of  equal  length  y  =  d-c  to  generate  c  =  y0  <  y1  <
                                                  n

y2 < · · · < yn = d, and with the interval [r, s] using subintervals of

equal length z = s-r to have r = z0 < z1 < z2 < · · · < zl = s.

· Let Bijk be the sub-box of B with opposite vertices (xi-1, yj-1, zk-1)
   and (xi, yj, zk) for i between 1 and m, j between 1 and n, and k between
   1 and . The volume of each Bijk is V = x · y · z.
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                               261

· Let (xijk, yijk, zijk) be a point in box Bijk for each i, j, and k. The
   resulting triple Riemann sum for f on B is

                                           mn

                                            f (xijk  , yijk  , zijk  ) · V.

                                          i=1 j=1 k=1

                                                                                                     
    If f (x, y, z) represents the mass density of the box B, then, as we saw in
Preview Activity 11.7.1, the triple Riemann sum approximates the total mass
of the box B. In order to find the exact mass of the box, we need to let the
number of sub-boxes increase without bound (in other words, let m, n, and
go to infinity); in this case, the finite sum of the mass approximations becomes
the actual mass of the solid B. More generally, we have the following definition
of the triple integral.

Definition 11.7.3 With following notation defined as in a triple Riemann
sum, the triple integral of f over B is

                           mn

f (x, y, z) dV = lim                        f (xijk  , yijk  , zijk  ) · V.
B m,n,  i=1 j=1 k=1

                                                                                                     
    As we noted earlier, if f (x, y, z) represents the density of the solid B at

each point (x, y, z), then

                       M=    f (x, y, z) dV

                           B

is the mass of B. Even more importantly, for any continuous function f over
the solid B, we can use a triple integral to determine the average value of
f over B, fAVG(B). We note this generalization of our work with functions
of two variables along with several others in the following important boxed
information. Note that each of these quantities may actually be considered
over a general domain S in R3, not simply a box, B.

· The triple integral

                                   V (S) =    1 dV
represents the volume of the solid S.
                                            S

· The average value of the function f = f (x, y, x) over a solid domain S is

given by

          fAVG(S) =          1                f (x, y, z) dV,
                           V (S)
                                            S

where V (S) is the volume of the solid S.

· The center of mass of the solid S with density  = (x, y, z) is (x, y, z),
   where

                       x = S x (x, y, z) dV ,
                                        M

                       y = S y (x, y, z) dV ,
                                        M

                       z = S z (x, y, z) dV ,
                                        M
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                 262

and M =       (x, y, z) dV is the mass of the solid S.

            S

    In the Cartesian coordinate system, the volume element dV is dz dy dx,
and, as a consequence, a triple integral of a function f over a box B = [a, b] ×
[c, d] × [r, s] in Cartesian coordinates can be evaluated as an iterated integral
of the form

                              bds

            f (x, y, z) dV =            f (x, y, z) dz dy dx.

         B                    ac r

    If we want to evaluate a triple integral as an iterated integral over a solid
S that is not a box, then we need to describe the solid in terms of variable
limits.

    of S is shown at right in Figure 11.7.4. Our goal in what follows is to set
    up an iterated integral of the form

                 x=? y=? z=?                                   (11.7.1)

                                      (x, y, z) dz dy dx

                x=? y=? z=?

to represent the mass of S in the setting where (x, y, z) tells us the
density of S at the point (x, y, z). Our particular task is to find the
limits on each of the three integrals.

i. If we think about slicing up the solid, we can consider slicing the
    domain of the solid's projection onto the xy-plane (just as we would
    slice a two-dimensional region in R2), and then slice in the z-direction
    as well. The projection of the solid onto the xy-plane is shown at
    left in Figure 11.7.4. If we decide to first slice the domain of the
    solid's projection perpendicular to the x-axis, over what range of
    constant x-values would we have to slice?

ii. If we continue with slicing the domain, what are the limits on y on
    a typical slice? How do these depend on x? What, therefore, are
    the limits on the middle integral?
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                         263

iii. Finally, now that we have thought about slicing up the two-dimensional
    domain that is the projection of the cone, what are the limits on z
    in the innermost integral? Note that over any point (x, y) in the
    plane, a vertical slice in the z direction will involve a range of values
    from the cone itself to its flat top. In particular, observe that at
    least one of these limits is not constant but depends on x and y.

iv. In conclusion, write an iterated integral of the form (11.7.1) that

   represents the mass of the cone S.

Note well: When setting up iterated integrals, the limits on a given variable

can be only in terms of the remaining variables. In addition, there are multiple

different ways we can choose to set up such an integral. For example, two pos-

sibilities for iterated integrals that represent a triple integral  S f (x, y, z) dV
over a solid S are

· a g1(x) h1(x,y) b g2(x) h2(x,y) f (x, y, z) dz dy dx

   · r p1(z) q1(x,z) s p2(z) q2(x,z) f (x, y, z) dy dx dz

    where g1, g2, h1, h2, p1, p2, q1, and q2 are functions of the indicated
variables. There are four other options beyond the two stated here, since the
variables x, y, and z can (theoretically) be arranged in any order. Of course, in
many circumstances, an insightful choice of variable order will make it easier
to set up an iterated integral, just as was the case when we worked with double
integrals.

Example 11.7.5 Find the mass of the tetrahedron in the first octant bounded
by the coordinate planes and the plane x + 2y + 3z = 6 if the density at point
(x, y, z) is given by (x, y, z) = x + y + z. A picture of the solid tetrahedron is
shown at left in Figure 11.7.6.

    We find the mass, M , of the tetrahedron by the triple integral

             M=    (x, y, z) dV,

                 S

where S is the solid tetrahedron described above. In this example, we choose
to integrate with respect to z first for the innermost integral. The top of the
tetrahedron is given by the equation

             x + 2y + 3z = 6;
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                                      264

solving for z then yields

                                    1
                               z = (6 - x - 2y).

                                    3

    The bottom of the tetrahedron is the xy-plane, so the limits on z in the

iterated integral will be 0  z  13 (6 - x - 2y).
    To find the bounds on x and y we project the tetrahedron onto the xy-

plane; this corresponds to setting z = 0 in the equation z = 13 (6 - x - 2y). The
resulting relation between x and y is

                                  x + 2y = 6.

    The right image in Figure 11.7.6 shows the projection of the tetrahedron

onto the xy-plane.

    If we choose to integrate with respect to y for the middle integral in the

iterated integral, then the lower limit on y is the x-axis and the upper limit

is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Note that the hypotenuse joins the points
(6, 0) and (0, 3) and so has equation y = 3 - 12 x. Thus, the bounds on y are
0  y  3 - 12 x. Finally, the x values run from 0 to 6, so the iterated integral
that gives the mass of the tetrahedron is

       6 3-(1/2)x (1/3)(6-x-2y)

M=                                           x + y + z dz dy dx.     (11.7.2)

    Setting up limits on iterated integrals can require considerable geometric
intuition. It is important to not only create carefully labeled figures, but also
to think about how we wish to slice the solid. Further, note that when we say
"we will integrate first with respect to x," by "first" we are referring to the
innermost integral in the iterated integral. The next activity explores several
different ways we might set up the integral in the preceding example.

Activity 11.7.3 There are several other ways we could have set up the integral
to give the mass of the tetrahedron in Example 11.7.5.

   a. How many different iterated integrals could be set up that are equal to
       the integral in Equation (11.7.2)?
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                   265

   b. Set up an iterated integral, integrating first with respect to z, then x,
       then y that is equivalent to the integral in Equation (11.7.2). Before
       you write down the integral, think about Figure 11.7.6, and draw an
       appropriate two-dimensional image of an important projection.

   c. Set up an iterated integral, integrating first with respect to y, then z,
       then x that is equivalent to the integral in Equation (11.7.2). As in (b),
       think carefully about the geometry first.

   d. Set up an iterated integral, integrating first with respect to x, then y,
       then z that is equivalent to the integral in Equation (11.7.2).

    Now that we have begun to understand how to set up iterated triple in-
tegrals, we can apply them to determine important quantities, such as those
found in the next activity.

Activity 11.7.4 A solid S is bounded below by the square z = 0, -1  x  1,
-1  y  1 and above by the surface z = 2 - x2 - y2. A picture of the solid is
shown in Figure 11.7.7.

                                                                                z2

Figure 11.7.7 The solid bounded by the surface z = 2 - x2 - y2.

a. First, set up an iterated double integral to find the volume of the solid S
    as a double integral of a solid under a surface. Then set up an iterated
    triple integral that gives the volume of the solid S. You do not need to
    evaluate either integral. Compare the two approaches.

b. Set up (but do not evaluate) iterated integral expressions that will tell us
    the center of mass of S, if the density at point (x, y, z) is (x, y, z) = x2+1.

c. Set up (but do not evaluate) an iterated integral to find the average
    density on S using the density function from part (b).

d. Use technology appropriately to evaluate the iterated integrals you de-
    termined in (a), (b), and (c); does the location you determined for the
    center of mass make sense?

of the triple integral naturally extends to non-rectangular solid regions
S.

· The triple integral S f (x, y, z) dV can tell us

        the volume of the solid S if f (x, y, z) = 1,
        the mass of the solid S if f represents the density of S at the point

          (x, y, z).

Moreover,

           fAVG(S) = V (S)
                                   S

is the average value of f over S.

      as concentrated at a single point, the center of mass. If the object has
      density (x, y, z) at the point (x, y, z) and occupies a region W , then the

14. This problem asks you to investigate the average value of some different
      quantities.

          a. Set up, but do not evaluate, an iterated integral expression whose
              value is the average sum of all real numbers x, y, and z that have
              the following property: y is between 0 and 2, x is greater than or
              equal to 0 but cannot exceed 2y, and z is greater than or equal to 0
              but cannot exceed x + y.

b. Set up, but do not evaluate, an integral expression whose value
    represents the average value of f (x, y, z) = x + y + z over the solid
    region in the first octant bounded by the surface z = 4 - x - y2 and
    the coordinate planes x = 0, y = 0, z = 0.

          c. How are the quantities in (a) and (b) similar? How are they differ-
              ent?

15. Consider the solid that lies between the paraboloids z = g(x, y) = x2 + y2
      and z = f (x, y) = 8 - 3x2 - 3y2.

          a. By eliminating the variable z, determine the curve of intersection
              between the two paraboloids, and sketch this curve in the xy-plane.

b. Set up, but do not evaluate, an iterated integral expression whose
    value determines the mass of the solid, integrating first with respect
    to z, then y, then x. Assume the the solid's density is given by
    (x, y, z) = x2+y2+z2+1 1 .

c. Set up, but do not evaluate, iterated integral expressions whose

    values determine the mass of the solid using all possible remaining

    orders  of  integration.  Use  (x, y, z) =           1       as  the  density  of

CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS  271

          d. Set up, but do not evaluate, iterated integral expressions whose
              values determine the center of mass of the solid. Again, assume the
              the solid's density is given by (x, y, z) = x2+y2+z2+1 1 .

          e. Which coordinates of the center of mass can you determine without
              evaluating any integral expression? Why?

16. In each of the following problems, your task is to

          · sketch, by hand, the region over which you integrate

          · set up iterated integral expressions which, when evaluated, will de-
              termine the value sought

          · use appropriate technology to evaluate each iterated integral expres-
              sion you develop

           Note well: in some problems you may be able to use a double rather
      than a triple integral, and polar coordinates may be helpful in some cases.

          a. Consider the solid created by the region enclosed by the circular
              paraboloid z = 4-x2 -y2 over the region R in the xy-plane enclosed
              by y = -x and the circle x2 + y2 = 4 in the first, second, and fourth
              quadrants. Determine the solid's volume.

          b. Consider the solid region that lies beneath the circular paraboloid
              z = 9-x2 -y2 over the triangular region between y = x, y = 2x, and
              y = 1. Assuming that the solid has its density at point (x, y, z) given
              by (x, y, z) = xyz + 1, measured in grams per cubic cm, determine
              the center of mass of the solid.

          c. In a certain room in a house, the walls can be thought of as being
              formed by the lines y = 0, y = 12 + x/4, x = 0, and x = 12, where
              length is measured in feet. In addition, the ceiling of the room is
              vaulted and is determined by the plane z = 16 - x/6 - y/3. A
              heater is stationed in the corner of the room at (0, 0, 0) and causes
              the temperature in the room at a particular time to be given by

                                                                 80
                                   T (x, y, z) = 1 + 1000 x2 + 1000 y2 + 1000 z2

              What is the average temperature in the room?

          d. Consider the solid enclosed by the cylinder x2 + y2 = 9 and the
              planes y + z = 5 and z = 1. Assuming that the solid's density is
              given by (x, y, z) = x2 + y2, find the mass and center of mass of
              the solid.

11.8 Triple Integrals in Cylindrical and Spherical
       Coordinates

Motivating Questions

   · What are the cylindrical coordinates of a point, and how are they related
       to Cartesian coordinates?

   · What is the volume element in cylindrical coordinates? How does this
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS        272

       inform us about evaluating a triple integral as an iterated integral in
       cylindrical coordinates?

   · What are the spherical coordinates of a point, and how are they related
       to Cartesian coordinates?

   · What is the volume element in spherical coordinates? How does this
       inform us about evaluating a triple integral as an iterated integral in
       spherical coordinates?

    We have encountered two different coordinate systems in R2 -- the rect-
angular and polar coordinates systems -- and seen how in certain situations,
polar coordinates form a convenient alternative. In a similar way, there are
two additional natural coordinate systems in R3. Given that we are already
familiar with the Cartesian coordinate system for R3, we next investigate the
cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems (each of which builds upon polar
coordinates in R2). In what follows, we will see how to convert among the
different coordinate systems, how to evaluate triple integrals using them, and
some situations in which these other coordinate systems prove advantageous.

Preview Activity 11.8.1 In the following questions, we investigate the two
new coordinate systems that are the subject of this section: cylindrical and
spherical coordinates. Our goal is to consider some examples of how to convert
from rectangular coordinates to each of these systems, and vice versa. Triangles
and trigonometry prove to be particularly important.

Figure 11.8.1 The cylindrical (left) and spherical (right) coordinates of a
point.

a. The cylindrical coordinates of a point in R3 are given by (r, , z) where
    r and  are the polar coordinates of the point (x, y) and z is the same z
    coordinate as in Cartesian coordinates. An illustration is given at left in
    Figure 11.8.1.

       i. Find cylindrical coordinates for the point whose Cartesian coordi-
          nates are (-1, 3, 3). Draw a labeled picture illustrating all of the
          coordinates.

      ii. Find the Cartesian coordinates of the point whose cylindrical coor-
          dinates are 2, 54 , 1 . Draw a labeled picture illustrating all of the
          coordinates.

b. The spherical coordinates of a point in R3 are  (rho), , and  (phi),
    where  is the distance from the point to the origin,  has the same
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                         273

interpretation it does in polar coordinates, and  is the angle between the
positive z axis and the vector from the origin to the point, as illustrated
at right in Figure 11.8.1. You should convince yourself that any point in
R3 can be represented in spherical coordinates with   0, 0   < 2,
and 0    .

For the following questions, consider the point P whose Cartesian coor-
dinates are (-2, 2, 8).

   i. What is the distance from P to the origin? Your result is the value
      of  in the spherical coordinates of P .

  ii. Determine the point that is the projection of P onto the xy-plane.
      Then, use this projection to find the value of  in the polar coor-
      dinates of the projection of P that lies in the plane. Your result is
      also the value of  for the spherical coordinates of the point.

 iii. Based on the illustration in Figure 11.8.1, how is the angle  de-
      termined by  and the z coordinate of P ? Use a well-chosen right
      triangle to find the value of , which is the final component in the
      spherical coordinates of P . Draw a carefully labeled picture that
      clearly illustrates the values of , , and  in this example, along
      with the original rectangular coordinates of P .

 iv. Based on your responses to i., ii., and iii., if we are given the Carte-
      sian coordinates (x, y, z) of a point Q, how are the values of , ,
      and  in the spherical coordinates of Q determined by x, y, and z?

11.8.1 Cylindrical Coordinates

As we stated in Preview Activity 11.8.1, the cylindrical coordinates of a point
are (r, , z), where r and  are the polar coordinates of the point (x, y), and z
is the same z coordinate as in Cartesian coordinates. The general situation is
illustrated Figure 11.8.1.

    Since we already know how to convert between rectangular and polar co-
ordinates in the plane, and the z coordinate is identical in both Cartesian and
cylindrical coordinates, the conversion equations between the two systems in
R3 are essentially those we found for polar coordinates.

       Coverting between Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates.

        · If we are given the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) of a point P ,
            then the cylindrical coordinates (r, , z) of P satisfy

                        x = r cos() y = r sin() and z = z.

· If we are given the cylindrical coordinates (r, , z) of a point P ,
   then the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) of P satisfy

r2 = x2 + y2                 y     and  z = z,
                 tan() =
                                x

assuming x = 0.

    Just as with rectangular coordinates, where we usually write z as a function
of x and y to plot the resulting surface, in cylindrical coordinates, we often
express z as a function of r and . In the following activity, we explore several
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                            274

basic equations in cylindrical coordinates and the corresponding surface each
generates.

Activity 11.8.2 In this activity, we graph some surfaces using cylindrical co-
ordinates. To improve your intuition and test your understanding, you should
first think about what each graph should look like before you plot it using
appropriate technology.

   a. What familiar surface is described by the points in cylindrical coordinates
       with r = 2, 0    2, and 0  z  2? How does this example suggest
       that we call these coordinates cylindrical coordinates? How does your
       answer change if we restrict  to 0    ?

   b. What familiar surface is described by the points in cylindrical coordinates
       with  = 2, 0  r  2, and 0  z  2?

   c. What familiar surface is described by the points in cylindrical coordinates
       with z = 2, 0    2, and 0  r  2?

   d. Plot the graph of the cylindrical equation z = r, where 0    2 and
       0  r  2. What familiar surface results?

   e. Plot the graph of the cylindrical equation z =  for 0    4. What
       does this surface look like?

    As the name and Activity 11.8.2 suggest, cylindrical coordinates are useful
for describing surfaces that are cylindrical in nature.

11.8.2 Triple Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates

To evaluate a triple integral S f (x, y, z) dV as an iterated integral in Carte-
sian coordinates, we use the fact that the volume element dV is equal to
dz dy dx (which corresponds to the volume of a small box). To evaluate a
triple integral in cylindrical coordinates, we similarly must understand the
volume element dV in cylindrical coordinates.

Activity 11.8.3 A picture of a cylindrical box, B = {(r, , z) : r1  r 
r2, 1    2, z1  z  z2}, is shown in Figure 11.8.2. Let r = r2 - r1,
 = 2 - 1, and z = z2 - z1. We want to determine the volume V of B
in terms of r, , z, r, , and z.

                                                                       y

CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                            275

   b. Let A be the area of the projection of the box, B, onto the xy-plane,
       which is shaded blue in Figure 11.8.2. Recall that we previously deter-
       mined the area A in polar coordinates in terms of r, r, and . In
       light of the fact that we know A and that z is the standard z coordi-
       nate from Cartesian coordinates, what is the volume V in cylindrical
       coordinates?

    Activity 11.8.3 demonstrates that the volume element dV in cylindrical
coordinates is given by dV = r dz dr d, and hence the following rule holds in
general.

                   Triple integrals in cylindrical coordinates.

    Given a continuous function f = f (x, y, z) over a region S in R3,

  f (x, y, z) dV =    f (r cos(), r sin(), z) r dz dr d.

S                   S

    The latter expression is an iterated integral in cylindrical coordi-
nates.

    Of course, to complete the task of writing an iterated integral in cylindrical
coordinates, we need to determine the limits on the three integrals: , r, and z.
In the following activity, we explore how to do this in several situations where
cylindrical coordinates are natural and advantageous.

Activity 11.8.4 In this activity we work with triple integrals in cylindrical
coordinates.

   a. Let S be the solid bounded above by the graph of z = x2 + y2 and below
       by z = 0 on the unit disk in the xy-plane.

           i. The projection of the solid S onto the xy-plane is a disk. Describe
              this disk using polar coordinates.

          ii. Now describe the surfaces bounding the solid S using cylindrical
              coordinates.

         iii. Determine an iterated triple integral expression in cylindrical coor-
              dinates that gives the volume of S. You do not need to evaluate this
              integral.

   b. Suppose the density of the cone defined by r = 1 - z, with z  0, is given
       by (r, , z) = z. A picture of the cone is shown at left in Figure 11.8.3,
       and the projection of the cone onto the xy-plane in given at right in
       Figure 11.8.3. Set up an iterated integral in cylindrical coordinates that
       gives the mass of the cone. You do not need to evaluate this integral.

11.8.3 Spherical Coordinates

As we saw in Preview Activity 11.8.1, the spherical coordinates of a point in
3-space have the form (, , ), where  is the distance from the point to the
origin,  has the same meaning as in polar coordinates, and  is the angle
between the positive z axis and the vector from the origin to the point. The
overall situation is illustrated at right in Figure 11.8.1.

Figure 11.8.5 Converting from spherical to Cartesian coordinates.

    The example in Preview Activity 11.8.1 and Figure 11.8.5 suggest how to
convert between Cartesian and spherical coordinates.

Coverting between Cartesian and spherical coordinates.

· If we are given the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) of a point P ,
   then the spherical coordinates (, , ) of P satisfy

 = x2 + y2 + z2              y     and                        z
                 tan() =                          cos() = ,
                                x                 

where in the latter two equations, we require x = 0 and  = 0.

· If we are given the spherical coordinates (, , ) of a point P ,
   then the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) of P satisfy

x =  sin() cos() y =  sin() sin() and z =  cos().

    When it comes to thinking about particular surfaces in spherical coor-
dinates, similar to our work with cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates, we
usually write  as a function of  and ; this is a natural analog to polar coor-
dinates, where we often think of our distance from the origin in the plane as
being a function of . In spherical coordinates, we likewise often view  as a
function of  and , thus viewing distance from the origin as a function of two
key angles.

    In the following activity, we explore several basic equations in spherical
coordinates and the surfaces they generate.

Activity 11.8.5 In this activity, we graph some surfaces using spherical co-
ordinates. To improve your intuition and test your understanding, you should
first think about what each graph should look like before you plot it using
appropriate technology.

   a. What familiar surface is described by the points in spherical coordinates
       with  = 1, 0    2, and 0    ? How does this particular
       example demonstrate the reason for the name of this coordinate system?
       What if we restrict  to 0    2 ?

   b. What familiar surface is described by the points in spherical coordinates
       with  = 3 , 0    1, and 0    2?

   c. What familiar shape is described by the points in spherical coordinates

       with  = 6 , 0    1, and 0    ?

   d. Plot the graph of  = , for 0     and 0    2. How does the
       resulting surface appear?

    As the name and Activity 11.8.5 indicate, spherical coordinates are partic-
ularly useful for describing surfaces that are spherical in nature; they are also
convenient for working with certain conical surfaces.

11.8.4 Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates

As with rectangular and cylindrical coordinates, a triple integral S f (x, y, z) dV
in spherical coordinates can be evaluated as an iterated integral once we un-
derstand the volume element dV .

Activity 11.8.6 To find the volume element dV in spherical coordinates, we
need to understand how to determine the volume of a spherical box of the form
1    2 (with  = 2 - 1), 1    2 (with  = 2 - 1), and
1    2 (with  = 2 -1). An illustration of such a box is given at left in
Figure 11.8.6. This spherical box is a bit more complicated than the cylindrical
box we encountered earlier. In this situation, it is easier to approximate the
volume V than to compute it directly. Here we can approximate the volume
V of this spherical box with the volume of a Cartesian box whose sides have
the lengths of the sides of this spherical box. In other words,

          V  |P S| |P R| |P Q|,

where |P R| denotes the length of the circular arc from P to R.

b. What is the length of the arc P R? (Hint: The arc P R is an arc of a
    circle of radius 2, and arc length along a circle is the product of the
    angle measure (in radians) and the circle's radius.)

    circle as illustrated at right in Figure 11.8.6. What is the radius of this
    circle?)

    Letting , , and  go to 0, it follows from the final result in Ac-
tivity 11.8.6 that dV = 2 sin() d d d in spherical coordinates, and thus
allows us to state the following general rule.

                    Triple integrals in spherical coordinates.

    Given a continuous function f = f (x, y, z) over a region S in R3, the
    triple integral S f (x, y, z) dV is converted to the integral

                 f ( sin() cos(),  sin() sin(),  cos()) 2 sin() d d d

                     S

    in spherical coordinates.
         The latter expression is an iterated integral in spherical coordinates.

    Finally, in order to actually evaluate an iterated integral in spherical coor-
dinates, we must of course determine the limits of integration in , , and .
The process is similar to our earlier work in the other two coordinate systems.

Activity 11.8.7 We can use spherical coordinates to help us more easily un-
derstand some natural geometric objects.

   a. Recall that the sphere of radius a has spherical equation  = a. Set up
       and evaluate an iterated integral in spherical coordinates to determine
       the volume of a sphere of radius a.

b. Set up, but do not evaluate, an iterated integral expression in spherical

coordinates whose value is the mass of the solid obtained by removing the

cone    =     from  the  sphere    =  2  if  the  density    at  the  point  (x, y, z)
           4

is (x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2. An illustration of the solid is shown in

Figure 11.8.7.

11.8.5 Summary

· The cylindrical coordinates of a point P are (r, , z) where r is the dis-
   tance from the origin to the projection of P onto the xy-plane,  is the
   angle that the projection of P onto the xy-plane makes with the positive
   x-axis, and z is the vertical distance from P to the projection of P onto
   the xy-plane. When P has rectangular coordinates (x, y, z), it follows
   that its cylindrical coordinates are given by

                r2 = x2 + y2,                     y        z = z.
                                      tan() = ,

CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                    280

When P has given cylindrical coordinates (r, , z), its rectangular coor-
dinates are

                     x = r cos(), y = r sin(), z = z.

· The volume element dV in cylindrical coordinates is dV = r dz dr d.

Hence, a triple integral  S f (x, y, z) dA can be evaluated as the iterated
integral

                         f (r cos(), r sin(), z) r dz dr d.

                       S

· The spherical coordinates of a point P in 3-space are  (rho), , and 
   (phi), where  is the distance from P to the origin,  is the angle that the
   projection of P onto the xy-plane makes with the positive x-axis, and 
   is the angle between the positive z axis and the vector from the origin to
   P . When P has Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z), the spherical coordinates
   are given by

              2 = x2 + y2 + z2,              y              z
                                 tan() = ,      cos() = .

                                             x              

Given the point P in spherical coordinates (, , ), its rectangular coor-
dinates are

      x =  sin() cos(), y =  sin() sin(), z =  cos().

· The volume element dV in spherical coordinates is dV = 2 sin() d d d.

Thus, a triple integral   S f (x, y, z) dA can be evaluated as the iterated
integral

           f ( sin() cos(),  sin() sin(),  cos()) 2 sin() d d d.

11.9 Change of Variables

Motivating Questions

   · What is a change of variables?

· What is the Jacobian, and how is it related to a change of variables?

In single variable calculus, we encountered the idea of a change of variable

in a definite integral through the method of substitution. For example, given

the definite integral

                                               2

                                                2x(x2 + 1)3 dx,

                                         0

we naturally consider the change of variable u = x2 +1. From this substitution,

it follows that du = 2x dx, and since x = 0 implies u = 1 and x = 2 implies

u = 5, we have transformed the original integral in x into a new integral in u.

In particular,

                                   2                               5

                                      2x(x2 + 1)3 dx = u3 du.

                                0                            1

The latter integral, of course, is far easier to evaluate.

Through our work with polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates, we

have already implicitly seen some of the issues that arise in using a change

of variables with two or three variables present. In what follows, we seek

to understand the general ideas behind any change of variables in a multiple

integral.

Preview Activity 11.9.1 Consider the double integral

                                         I=           x2 + y2 dA,                               (11.9.1)

                                                   D

where D is the upper half of the unit disk.
   a. i. Write the double integral I given in Equation (11.9.1) as an iterated
              integral in rectangular coordinates.

   ii. Write the double integral I given in Equation (11.9.1) as an iterated
       integral in polar coordinates.

b. When we write the double integral (11.9.1) as an iterated integral in polar
    coordinates we make a change of variables, namely

                             x = r cos() and y = r sin().                                       (11.9.2)

We also then have to change dA to r dr d. This process also identifies a
"polar rectangle" [r1, r2] × [1, 2] with the original Cartesian rectangle,
under the transformation1 in Equation (11.9.2). The vertices of the polar
rectangle are transformed into the vertices of a closed and bounded region
in rectangular coordinates.

To work with a numerical example, let's now consider the polar rectangle

P  given        by  [1,  2]  ×  [     ,  4 ],  so  that  r1  = 1,  r2  = 2,  1  =  6 ,  and  2  =  4 .
                                   6

           i. Use the transformation determined by the equations in (11.9.2) to
              find the rectangular vertices that correspond to the polar vertices in
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS              285

       the polar rectangle P . In other words, by substituting appropriate
       values of r and  into the two equations in (11.9.2), find the val-
       ues of the corresponding x and y coordinates for the vertices of the
       polar rectangle P . Label the point that corresponds to the polar
       vertex (r1, 1) as (x1, y1), the point corresponding to the polar ver-
       tex (r2, 1) as (x2, y2), the point corresponding to the polar vertex
       (r1, 2) as (x3, y3), and the point corresponding to the polar vertex
       (r2, 2) as (x4, y4).

   ii. Draw a picture of the figure in rectangular coordinates that has
       the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), and (x4, y4) as vertices. (Note
       carefully that because of the trigonometric functions in the transfor-
       mation, this region will not look like a Cartesian rectangle.) What
       is the area of this region in rectangular coordinates? How does this
       area compare to the area of the original polar rectangle?

11.9.1 Change of Variables in Polar Coordinates

The general idea behind a change of variables is suggested by Preview Activ-
ity 11.9.1. There, we saw that in a change of variables from rectangular coor-
dinates to polar coordinates, a polar rectangle [r1, r2] × [1, 2] gets mapped to
a Cartesian rectangle under the transformation

        x = r cos() and y = r sin().

    The vertices of the polar rectangle P are transformed into the vertices of
a closed and bounded region P in rectangular coordinates. If we view the
standard coordinate system as having the horizontal axis represent r and the
vertical axis represent , then the polar rectangle P appears to us at left in
Figure 11.9.1. The image P of the polar rectangle P under the transformation
given by (11.9.2) is shown at right in Figure 11.9.1. We thus see that there is a
correspondence between a simple region (a traditional, right-angled rectangle)
and a more complicated region (a fraction of an annulus) under the function
T given by T (r, ) = (r cos(), r sin()).

    1A transformation is another name for function: here, the equations x = r cos() and
y = r sin() define a function T by T (r, ) = (r cos(), r sin()) so that T is a function
(transformation) from R2 to R2. We view this transformation as mapping a version of the
xy-plane where the axes are viewed as representing r and  (the r-plane) to the familiar
xy-plane.
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS  286

    Furthermore, as Preview Activity 11.9.1 suggests, it follows generally that

for an original polar rectangle P = [r1, r2]×[1, 2], the area of the transformed
rectangle P is given by r2+r1 2 r. Therefore, as r and  go to 0 this
area becomes the familiar area element dA = r dr d in polar coordinates.

When we proceed to working with other transformations for different changes

in coordinates, we have to understand how the transformation affects area so

that we may use the correct area element in the new system of variables.

11.9.2 General Change of Coordinates

We first focus on double integrals. As with single integrals, we may be able to
simplify a double integral of the form

                                                f (x, y) dA

                                                                 D

by making a change of variables (that is, a substitution) of the form

                             x = x(s, t) and y = y(s, t)

where x and y are functions of new variables s and t. This transformation
introduces a correspondence between a problem in the xy-plane and one in the
the st-plane. The equations x = x(s, t) and y = y(s, t) convert s and t to x
and y; we call these formulas the change of variable formulas. To complete the
change to the new s, t variables, we need to understand the area element, dA,
in this new system. The following activity helps to illustrate the idea.

Activity 11.9.2 Consider the change of variables
                                                                      

                           x = s + 2t and y = 2s + t.

    Let's see what happens to the rectangle T = [0, 1] × [1, 4] in the st-plane
under this change of variable.

   a. Draw a labeled picture of T in the st-plane.

   b. Find the image of the st-vertex (0, 1) in the xy-plane. Likewise, find the
       respective images of the other three vertices of the rectangle T : (0, 4),
       (1, 1), and (1, 4).

   c. In the xy-plane, draw a labeled picture of the image, T , of the original
       st-rectangle T . What appears to be the shape of the image, T ?

   d. To transform an integral with a change of variables, we need to determine
       the area element dA for image of the transformed rectangle. Note that T
       is not exactly a parallelogram since the equations that define the trans-
       formation are not lienar. But we can approximate the area of T with the
       area of a parallelogram. How would we find the area of a parallelogram
       that approximates the area of the xy-figure T ? (Hint: Remember what
       the cross product of two vectors tells us.)

    Activity 11.9.2 presents the general idea of how a change of variables works.
We partition a rectangular domain in the st system into subrectangles. Let
T = [a, b]×[a+s, b+t] be one of these subrectangles. Then we transform this
into a region T in the standard xy Cartesian coordinate system. The region T
is called the image of T ; the region T is the pre-image of T . Although the sides
of this xy region T aren't necessarily straight (linear), we will approximate the
element of area dA for this region with the area of the parallelogram whose sides
CHAPTER 11. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS                                         287

are given by the vectors v and w, where v is the vector from (x(a, b), y(a, b))
to (x(a + s, b), y(a + s, b)), and w is the vector from (x(a, b), y(a, b)) to
(x(a, b + t), y(a, b + t)).

    An example of an image T in the xy-plane that results from a transforma-
tion of a rectangle T in the st-plane is shown in Figure 11.9.2.

Figure 11.9.2 Approximating an area of an image resulting from a transfor-
mation.

    The components of the vector v are

       v = x(a + s, b) - x(a, b), y(a + s, b) - y(a, b), 0

and similarly those for w are

       w = x(a, b + t) - x(a, b), y(a, b + s) - y(a, b), 0 .

Slightly rewriting v and w, we have

   v=  x(a + s, b) - x(a, b) y(a + s, b) - y(a, b)  , 0 s, and
                                  ,
                    s                      s

   w=  x(a, b + t) - x(a, b) y(a, b + s) - y(a, b)  , 0 t.
                                  ,
                    t                      t

For small s and t, the definition of the partial derivative tells us that

   x          y                                  x        y
v  (a, b), (a, b), 0 s and w  (a, b), (a, b), 0 t.
   s          s                                  t        t

    Recall that the area of the parallelogram with sides v and w is the length
of the cross product of the two vectors, |v × w|. From this, we observe that

                x      y                   x        y
   v×w             (a, b), (a, b), 0 s × (a, b), (a, b), 0 t
           =    s      s                   t        t

                    x y                 x y
              0, 0, (a, b) (a, b) - (a, b) (a, b) s t.
                    s          t        t        s

Finally, by computing the magnitude of the cross product, we see that

                    x y                 x y
   |v × w|         0, 0, (a, b) (a, b) - (a, b) (a, b) s t
             =      s             t     t        s

                 x y                 x y
                    (a, b) (a, b) - (a, b) (a, b) s t.

    Therefore, as the number of subdivisions increases without bound in each
direction, s and t both go to zero, and we have

                          dA =  x y x y         ds dt.                      (11.9.3)

                                s t t s

    Equation (11.9.3) hence determines the general change of variable formula
in a double integral, and we can now say that

  f (x, y) dy dx =              f (x(s, t), y(s, t))  x y x y       ds dt.

                                s t t s

is called the Jacobian, and we denote the Jacobian using the shorthand notation

                          (x, y) x y x y
                                =         -              .
                          (s, t) s t t s

Recall from Section 9.4 that we can also write this Jacobian as the determi-

                                                    x x

allelogram determined by the vectors v and w, and so the area element dA

in xy-coordinates is also represented by the area element (s,t) (x,y) ds dt in st-

coordinates, and (s,t) (x,y) is the factor by which the transformation magnifies
area.

To summarize, the preceding change of variable formula that we have de-

rived now follows.

Change of Variables in a Double Integral.

Suppose a change of variables x = x(s, t) and y = y(s, t) transforms a
closed and bounded region R in the st-plane into a closed and bounded
region R in the xy-plane. Under modest conditions (that are studied
in advanced calculus), it follows that

   f (x, y) dA =                   f (x(s, t), y(s, t))     (x, y)  ds dt.

R                               R                           (s, t)

Activity 11.9.3 Find the Jacobian when changing from rectangular to polar
coordinates. That is, for the transformation given by x = r cos(), y = r sin(),
determine a simplified expression for the quantity

Activity 11.9.4 Let D be the region in the xy-plane bounded by the lines
y = 0, x = 0, and x + y = 1. We will evaluate the double integral

                             x + y(x - y)2 dA                               (11.9.4)

with a change of variables.
   a. Sketch the region D in the xy-plane.

   b. We would like to make a substitution that makes the integrand easier to
       antidifferentiate. Let s = x + y and t = x - y. Explain why this should
       make antidifferentiation easier by making the corresponding substitutions
       and writing the new integrand in terms of s and t.

   c. Solve the equations s = x + y and t = x - y for x and y. (Doing so
       determines the standard form of the transformation, since we will have
       x as a function of s and t, and y as a function of s and t.)

   d. To actually execute this change of variables, we need to know the st-
       region D that corresponds to the xy-region D .

           i. What st equation corresponds to the xy equation x + y = 1?
          ii. What st equation corresponds to the xy equation x = 0?
         iii. What st equation corresponds to the xy equation y = 0?
         iv. Sketch the st region D that corresponds to the xy domain D .

   e. Make the change of variables indicated by s = x + y and t = x - y in
       the double integral (11.9.4) and set up an iterated integral in st variables
       whose value is the original given double integral. Finally, evaluate the
       iterated integral.

11.9.3 Change of Variables in a Triple Integral

The argument for the change of variable formula for triple integrals is com-

plicated, and we will not go into the details. The general process, though, is

the same as the two-dimensional case. Given a solid S in the xyz-coordinate
system in R3, a change of variables transformation x = x(s, t, u), y = y(s, t, u),
and z = z(s, t, u) transforms S into a region S in stu-coordinates. Any

function f = f (x, y, z) defined on S can be considered as a function f =

f (x(s, t, u), y(s, y, u), z(s, t, u)) in stu-coordinates defined on S. The volume

element dV in xyz-coordinates cooresponds to a scaled volume element in

stu-coordinates, where the scale factor is given by the absolute value of the
Jacobian, (s,t,u) (x,y,z) , which is the determinant of the 3 × 3 matrix

                                       x x x 

                                                             s t u

                                       y y y  .

                                                             s t u
                                                             z z z
                                                             s t u

(Recall that this determinant was introduced in Section 9.4.) That is, (s,t,u) (x,y,z)
is given by

x y z y z x y z y z x y z y z
-              -  -             +                -  .

drical coordinates. That is, for the transformation given by x = r cos(),

earlier work with triple integrals in cylindrial coordinates?

11.9.4 Summary

    · If an integral is described in terms of one set of variables, we may write
       that set of variables in terms of another set of the same number of vari-
       ables. If the new variables are chosen appropriately, the transformed
       integral may be easier to evaluate.

    · The Jacobian is a scalar function that relates the area or volume element
       in one coordinate system to the corresponding element in a new system
       determined by a change of variables.

10. Let D be the region in the xy-plane that is the parallelogram with vertices
      (3, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4), and (6, 6).

   a. Sketch and label the region D in the xy-plane.

   b. Consider the integral D (x + y) dA. Explain why this integral
       would be difficult to set up as an iterated integral.

   c. Let a change of variables be given by x = 2u + v, y = u + 2v. Using
      substitution or elimination, solve this system of equations for u and
      v in terms of x and y.

   d. Use your work in (c) to find the pre-image, D, which lies in the uv-
       plane, of the originally given region D , which lies in the xy-plane.
       For instance, what uv point corresponds to (3, 3) in the xy-plane?

   e. Use the change of variables in (c) and your other work to write a
      new iterated integral in u and v that is equivalent to the original xy
      integral D (x + y) dA.

   f. Finally, evaluate the uv integral, and write a sentence to explain
      why the change of variables made the integration easier.

11. Consider the change of variables

      x(, , ) =  sin() cos() y(, , ) =  sin() sin() z(, , ) =  cos(),

      which is the transformation from spherical coordinates to rectangular co-
      ordinates. Determine the Jacobian of the transformation. How is the
      result connected to our earlier work with iterated integrals in spherical
      coordinates?
12. In this problem, our goal is to find the volume of the ellipsoid a2 x2 + b2 y2 + c2 z2 =
      1.

          a. Set up an iterated integral in rectangular coordinates whose value is
              the volume of the ellipsoid. Do so by using symmetry and taking 8
              times the volume of the ellipsoid in the first octant where x, y, and
              z are all nonnegative.

          b. Explain why it makes sense to use the substitution x = as, y = bt,
              and z = cu in order to make the region of integration simpler.

          c. Compute the Jacobian of the transformation given in (b).

          d. Execute the given change of variables and set up the corresponding
              new iterated integral in s, t, and u.

          e. Explain why this new integral is better, but is still difficult to eval-
              uate. What additional change of variables would make the resulting
              integral easier to evaluate?

           f. Convert the integral from (d) to a new integral in spherical coordi-
              nates.

          g. Finally, evaluate the iterated integral in (f) and hence determine the
              volume of the ellipsoid.
