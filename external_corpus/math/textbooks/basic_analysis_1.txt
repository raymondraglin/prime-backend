0.1 About this book

This first volume is a one semester course in basic analysis. With the second volume, it is a
year-long course. The book started its life as my lecture notes for teaching Math 444 at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in the fall semester of 2009. I added the
metric space chapter for Math 521 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW). Volume
II was added to teach Math 4143/4153 at Oklahoma State University (OSU). A prerequisite
for these courses is usually a basic proof course, using, for example, [H], [F], or [DW].

    It should be possible to use the book for both a basic course for students who do not
necessarily wish to go to graduate school (such as UIUC 444), and also as a more advanced
one-semester course that also covers topics such as metric spaces (such as UW 521). Here
are suggestions for a semester course. A slower course such as UIUC 444:

               §0.3, §1.1-§1.4, §2.1-§2.5, §3.1-§3.4, §4.1-§4.2, §5.1-§5.3, §6.1-§6.3

A more rigorous course covering metric spaces that runs quite a bit faster (e.g., UW 521):

         §0.3, §1.1-§1.4, §2.1-§2.5, §3.1-§3.4, §4.1-§4.2, §5.1-§5.3, §6.1-§6.2, §7.1-§7.6

It should also be possible to run a faster course without metric spaces covering all sections
of chapters 0 through 6. The approximate number of lectures given in the section notes
through Chapter 6 are a very rough estimate and were designed for the slower course. The
first few chapters of the book can be used in an introductory proofs course, as is done, for
example, at Iowa State University Math 201, where this book is used in conjunction with
Hammack's Book of Proof [H].

    With volume II, one can run a year-long course that covers multivariable topics. In this
scenario, it may make sense to cover most of the first volume in the first semester while
leaving metric spaces for the beginning of the second semester.

    The structure of the beginning of volume I somewhat follows the standard syllabus of
UIUC Math 444 and, therefore, has some similarities with Bartle and Sherbert, Introduction
to Real Analysis [BS], which is the standard book at UIUC. A major difference is that we
define the Riemann integral using Darboux sums and not tagged partitions. The Darboux
approach is far more appropriate for a course of this level.

    Our approach allows us to fit a course such as UIUC 444 within a semester and still
spend some time on the interchange of limits and end with Picard's theorem on the
6  INTRODUCTION

existence and uniqueness of solutions of ordinary differential equations. This theorem
is a wonderful example that uses many results proved in the book. For more advanced
students, material may be covered faster so that we arrive at metric spaces and prove
Picard's theorem using the fixed point theorem as is usual.

    Other excellent books exist. My favorite is Rudin's excellent Principles of Mathematical
Analysis [R2] or, as it is commonly and lovingly called, baby Rudin (to distinguish it from
his other great analysis textbook, big Rudin). I took a lot of inspiration and ideas from
Rudin. However, Rudin is a bit more advanced and ambitious than this present course.
For those who wish to continue mathematics, Rudin is a fine investment. An inexpensive
and somewhat simpler alternative to Rudin is Rosenlicht's Introduction to Analysis [R1].
There is also the freely downloadable Introduction to Real Analysis by William Trench [T].

    A note about the style of some of the proofs: Many proofs traditionally done by
contradiction, I prefer to do by a direct proof or by contrapositive. While the book does
include proofs by contradiction, I only do so when the contrapositive statement seemed
too awkward or when contradiction follows rather quickly. Contradiction is more likely to
get beginning students into trouble, as we are talking about objects that do not exist.

    I try to avoid unnecessary formalism where it is unhelpful. Furthermore, the proofs
and the language get slightly less formal as we progress through the book, as more and
more details are left out to avoid clutter.

    As a general rule, I use instead of = to define an object rather than to simply show
equality. I use this symbol rather more liberally than is usual for emphasis. I use it even
when the context is "local," that is, I may simply define a function  () 2 for a single
exercise or example.

    Finally, I would like to acknowledge Jana Maíková, Glen Pugh, Paul Vojta, Frank
Beatrous, Sönmez ahutolu, Jim Brandt, Kenji Kozai, Arthur Busch, Anton Petrunin, Mark
Meilstrup, Harold P. Boas, Atilla Yilmaz, Thomas Mahoney, Scott Armstrong, and Paul
Sacks, Matthias Weber, Manuele Santoprete, Robert Niemeyer, Amanullah Nabavi, for

University of Pittsburgh version extensions, which served as inspiration for many more
recent additions. I would also like to thank Dan Stoneham, Jeremy Sutter, Eliya Gwetta,

0.2. ABOUT ANALYSIS  7

0.2 About analysis

Analysis is the branch of mathematics that deals with inequalities and limits. The present
course deals with the most basic concepts in analysis. The goal of the course is to acquaint
the reader with rigorous proofs in analysis and also to set a firm foundation for calculus of
one variable (and several variables if volume II is also considered).

    Calculus has prepared you, the student, for using mathematics without telling you
why what you learned is true. To use, or teach, mathematics effectively, you cannot simply
know what is true, you must know why it is true. This course shows you why calculus is
true. It is here to give you a good understanding of the concept of a limit, the derivative,
and the integral.

    Let us use an analogy. An auto mechanic who has learned to change the oil, fix broken
headlights, and charge the battery, but who does not understand how the engine works,
will only be able to do those simple tasks. He will be unable to work independently to
diagnose and fix problems. A high school teacher who does not understand the definition
of the Riemann integral or the derivative may not be able to properly answer all the students'
questions. To this day I remember several nonsensical statements I heard from my calculus
teacher in high school, who simply did not understand the concept of the limit, although
he could "do" the problems in the textbook.

    We start with a discussion of the real number system, most importantly its completeness
property, which is the basis for all that follows. We then discuss the simplest form of a limit,
the limit of a sequence. Afterwards, we study functions of one variable, continuity, and the
derivative. Next, we define the Riemann integral and prove the fundamental theorem of
calculus. We discuss sequences of functions and the interchange of limits. Finally, we give
an introduction to metric spaces.

    Let us give the most important difference between analysis and algebra. In algebra, we
prove equalities directly; we prove that an object, perhaps a number, is equal to another
object. In analysis, we usually prove inequalities, and we prove those inequalities by
estimating. To illustrate the point, consider the following statement.

    Let  be a real number. If  <  is true for all real numbers  > 0, then   0.

    This statement is the general idea of what we do in analysis. Suppose we really wish to
prove the equality  = 0. In analysis, we prove two inequalities:   0 and   0. To prove
the inequality   0, we prove  <  for all positive . To prove the inequality   0, we
prove  > - for all positive .

    The term real analysis is a little bit of a misnomer. I prefer to use simply analysis. The
other type of analysis, complex analysis, really builds up on the present material, rather than
being distinct. Furthermore, a more advanced course on real analysis would talk about
complex numbers often. I suspect the nomenclature is historical baggage.

    Let us get on with the show. . .
8                                                                        INTRODUCTION

0.3 Basic set theory

Note: 1-3 lectures (some material can be skipped, covered lightly, or left as reading)

    Before we start talking about analysis, we need to fix some language. Modern analysis
uses the language of sets and, therefore, that is where we start. We talk about sets in a
rather informal way, using the so-called "naïve set theory." Do not worry, that is what the
majority of mathematicians use, and it is hard to get into trouble. The reader has hopefully
seen the very basics of set theory and proof writing before, and this section should be a
quick refresher.

0.3.1 Sets

Definition 0.3.1. A set is a collection of objects called elements or members. A set with no
objects is called the empty set and is denoted by  (or sometimes by {}).

    Think of a set as a club with a certain membership. For example, the students who play
chess are members of the chess club. The same student can be a member of many different
clubs. However, do not take the analogy too far. A set is only defined by the members that
form the set; two sets that have the same members are the same set.

    Most of the time, we will consider sets of numbers. For example, the set

                         {0, 1, 2}

is the set containing the three elements 0, 1, and 2. By " ", we mean we are defining what
 is, rather than just showing equality. We write

                        1

to denote that the number 1 belongs to the set . That is, 1 is a member of . At times we
want to say that two elements are in a set , so we write "1, 2  " as a shorthand for "1  
and 2  ."

   Similarly, we write

                        7

to denote that the number 7 is not in . That is, 7 is not a member of .

   The elements of all sets under consideration come from some set we call the universe.

For simplicity, we often consider the universe to be the set that contains only the elements

we are interested in. The universe is generally understood from context and is not explicitly

mentioned. In this course, our universe will often be the set of real numbers.

   Although the elements of a set are often numbers, other objects, such as other sets, can

be elements of a set. A set may also contain some of the same elements as another set. For

example,

                         {0, 2}

contains the numbers 0 and 2. In this case, all elements of  also belong to . We write
  . See Figure 1 for a diagram.

   The term "modern" refers to the late 19th century up to the present.

Definition 0.3.2.

   (i) A set  is a subset of a set  if    implies   , and we write   . That is, all
       members of  are also members of . At times we write    to mean the same
       thing.

  (ii) Two sets  and  are equal if    and   . We write  = . That is,  and 
       contain exactly the same elements. If it is not true that  and  are equal, then we
       write   .

 (iii) A set  is a proper subset of  if    and   . We write   .

    For the example  and  defined above,   , but   . So  is a proper subset of .
If  = , then  and  are simply two names for the same exact set.

    To define new sets, one often uses the set building notation,

                                        : () .

This notation refers to a subset of the set  containing all elements of  that satisfy the
property (). Using  = {0, 1, 2} as above, {   :   2} is the set {0, 1}. The notation is
sometimes abbreviated as  : () , that is,  is not mentioned when understood from
context. Furthermore,    is sometimes replaced with a formula to make the notation

easier to read.

Example 0.3.3: The following are sets including the standard notations.

(i) The set of natural numbers,  {1, 2, 3, . . .}.

(ii) The set of integers,  {0, -1, 1, -2, 2, . . .}.

(iii) The set of rational numbers,     : ,    and   0      .
                                     

(iv) The set of even natural numbers, {2 :   }.

(v) The set of real numbers, .

Note that       .

We create new sets out of old ones by applying some natural operations.
10             INTRODUCTION

Definition 0.3.4.
   (i) A union of two sets  and  is defined as

                                              { :    or   }.

  (ii) An intersection of two sets  and  is defined as

                                             { :    and   }.

 (iii) A complement of  relative to  (or set-theoretic difference of  and ) is defined as

                                           \  { :    and   }.

 (iv) We say complement of  and write  instead of  \  if the set  is either the entire
       universe or if it is the obvious set containing , and is understood from context.

  (v) We say sets  and  are disjoint if    = .
    The notation  may be a little vague at this point. If the set  is a subset of the real

numbers , then  means  \ . If  is naturally a subset of the natural numbers, then 
is  \ . If ambiguity can arise, we use the set difference notation  \ .

               

             

               

      \      

Figure 2: Venn diagrams of set operations, the result of the operation is shaded.

    We illustrate the operations on the Venn diagrams in Figure 2. Let us now establish one
of the most basic theorems about sets and logic.
0.3. BASIC SET THEORY                                    11

Theorem 0.3.5 (DeMorgan). Let , ,  be sets. Then
                              (  ) =   , (  ) =   ,

or, more generally,

 \ (  ) = ( \ )  ( \ ),  \ (  ) = ( \ )  ( \ ).

Proof. The first statement is proved by the second statement if we assume the set  is our

"universe."

Let us prove  \ (  ) = ( \ )  ( \ ). Remember the definition of equality of sets.

First, we must show that if    \ (  ), then   ( \ )  ( \ ). Second, we must also

show that if   ( \ )  ( \ ), then    \ (  ). So let us assume    \ (  ).

Then  is in , but not in  nor . Hence  is in  and not in , that is,    \ . Similarly,

   \ . Thus   ( \ )  ( \ ). On the other hand, suppose   ( \ )  ( \ ).

In particular,   ( \ ), so    and   . Also, as   ( \ ), then   . Hence

   \ (  ).

The proof of the other equality is left as an exercise.  

    The result above we called a Theorem, while most results we call a Proposition, and a few
we call a Lemma (a result leading to another result) or Corollary (a quick consequence of the
preceding result). Do not read too much into the naming. Some of it is traditional, some
of it is stylistic choice. It is not necessarily true that a Theorem is always "more important"
than a Proposition or a Lemma.

    We will also need to intersect or union several sets at once. If there are only finitely

many, then we simply apply the union or intersection operation several times. However,
suppose we have an infinite collection of sets (a set of sets) {1, 2, 3, . . .}. We define

                              { :    for some   },
                              { :    for all   }.
                         

                     =1
                      

                         

                     =1

    We can also have sets indexed by two natural numbers. For example, we can have the
set of sets {1,1, 1,2, 2,1, 1,3, 2,2, 3,1, . . .}. Then we write

                                   

                              , =         , .

                       =1 =1       =1 =1

And similarly with intersections.
    It is not hard to see that we can take the unions in any order. However, switching the

order of unions and intersections is not generally permitted without proof. For instance,

                                          

                              {   :  < } =  = .

                       =1 =1              =1
12                                                        INTRODUCTION

However,                        

                 {   :  < } =  = .

          =1 =1                 =1

    Sometimes, the index set is not the set of natural numbers. In such a case, we require a
more general notation. Suppose  is some set and for each   , there is a set . Then we

define

          { :    for some   },        { :    for all   }.

                                

0.3.2 Induction

When a statement includes an arbitrary natural number, a common proof method is the
principle of induction. We start with the set of natural numbers  = {1, 2, 3, . . .}, and we
give them their natural ordering, that is, 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < · · · . By    having a least
element, we mean that there exists an   , such that for every   , we have   .

    The natural numbers  ordered in the natural way possess the so-called well ordering
property. We take this property as an axiom; we simply assume it is true.

Well ordering property of . Every nonempty subset of  has a least (smallest) element.

    The principle of induction is the following theorem, which is in a sense equivalent to the
well ordering property of the natural numbers.

Theorem 0.3.6 (Principle of induction). Let () be a statement depending on a natural
number . Suppose that

   (i) (basis statement) (1) is true.
  (ii) (induction step) If () is true, then ( + 1) is true.

Then () is true for all   .

Proof. Let  be the set of natural numbers  for which () is not true. Suppose for

contradiction that  is nonempty. Then  has a least element by the well ordering property.

Call    the least element of . We know 1   by hypothesis. So  > 1, and  - 1 is a

natural number as well. Since  is the least element of , we know that ( - 1) is true.

But the induction step says that ( - 1 + 1) = () is true, contradicting the statement

that   . Therefore,  is empty and () is true for all   .   

    Sometimes it is convenient to start at a different number than 1, all that changes is
the labeling. The assumption that () is true in "if () is true, then ( + 1) is true" is
usually called the induction hypothesis.

     To be completely rigorous, this equivalence is only true if we also assume as an axiom that  - 1 exists for
all natural numbers bigger than 1, which we do. In this book, we are assuming all the usual arithmetic holds.
0.3. BASIC SET THEORY                                              13

Example 0.3.7: Let us prove that for all   ,

        2-1  ! (recall ! = 1 · 2 · 3 · · · ).

Let () be the statement that 2-1  ! is true. Plug in  = 1 to see that (1) is true.
    Suppose () is true. That is, suppose 2-1  ! holds. Multiply both sides by 2 to

obtain                 2  2(!).

As 2  ( + 1) when   , we have 2(!)  ( + 1)(!) = ( + 1)!. That is,

                       2  2(!)  ( + 1)!,

and hence ( + 1) is true. By the principle of induction, () is true for all   . In other
words, 2-1  ! is true for all   .

Example 0.3.8: We claim that for all   1,

                                      1 +  + 2 + · · · +  = 1 - +1 1 -  .

    Proof: It is easy to check that the equation holds with  = 1. Suppose it is true for .
Then

                     1 +  + 2 + · · · +  + +1 = (1 +  + 2 + · · · + ) + +1
                                                         = 1 - +1 1 -  + +1
                                                         = 1 - +1 + (1 - )+1
                                                                       1-
                                                         = 1 - +2 1 -  .

    Sometimes, it is easier to use in the inductive step that () is true for all  = 1, 2, . . . , ,
not just for  = . This principle is called strong induction and is equivalent to the normal
induction above. The proof of that equivalence is left as an exercise.

Theorem 0.3.9 (Principle of strong induction). Let () be a statement depending on a natural
number . Suppose that

   (i) (basis statement) (1) is true.

  (ii) (induction step) If () is true for all  = 1, 2, . . . , , then ( + 1) is true.

Then () is true for all   .

0.3.3 Functions

Informally, a set-theoretic function  taking a set  to a set  is a mapping that to each
   assigns a unique   . We write  :   . An example function  :    taking
14  INTRODUCTION

 {0, 1, 2} to  {0, 2} can be defined by assigning  (0) 2,  (1) 2, and  (2) 0.
That is, a function  :    is a black box, into which we stick an element of  and the
function spits out an element of . Sometimes  is called a mapping or a map, and we say 
maps  to .

    Often, functions are defined by some sort of formula; however, you should really think
of a function as just a very large table of values. The subtle issue here is that a single
function can have several formulas, all giving the same function. Also, for many functions,
there is no formula that expresses its values.

    To define a function rigorously, let us first define the Cartesian product.

Definition 0.3.10. Let  and  be sets. The Cartesian product is the set of tuples defined as

                                       ×  (, ) :   ,    .

    For instance, {, } × {, } = (, ), (, ), (, ), (, ) . A more complicated example
is the set [0, 1] × [0, 1]: a subset of the plane bounded by a square with vertices (0, 0), (0, 1),
(1, 0), and (1, 1). When  and  are the same set, we often use a superscript 2 to denote
such a product. For example, [0, 1]2 = [0, 1] × [0, 1] or 2 =  ×  (the Cartesian plane).

Definition 0.3.11. A function  :    is a subset  of  ×  such that for each   ,
there exists a unique    for which (, )   . We write  () = . Sometimes the set  is
called the graph of the function rather than the function itself.

    The set  is called the domain of  (and sometimes confusingly denoted (  )). The set

                     (  ) {   : there exists an    such that  () = }

is called the range of  . The set  is called the codomain of  .

    It is possible that the range (  ) is a proper subset of the codomain , while the domain
of  is always equal to . We generally assume that the domain of  is nonempty.

Example 0.3.12: From calculus, you are most familiar with functions taking real numbers
to real numbers. However, you saw some other types of functions as well. The derivative is
a function that maps the set of differentiable functions to the set of all functions. Another
example is the Laplace transform, which also takes functions to functions. Yet another
example is the function that takes a continuous function  defined on the interval [0, 1]

                               1
and returns the number 0 () .
Definition 0.3.13. Consider a function  :   . Define the image (or direct image) of a
subset    as

                                          ()  ()   :    .

Define the inverse image of a subset    as

                                         -1()    :  ()   .

    In particular, (  ) =  (), the range is the direct image of the domain .
0.3. BASIC SET THEORY                                                      15

1    {1, 2, 3, 4} = {, , }
                                               {1, 2, 4} = {, }

2                        {1} = {}

3   -1  -1 {, , } = {1, 3, 4} {} = 

4                        -1 {} = {1, 4}

Figure 3: Example of direct and inverse images for the function  : {1, 2, 3, 4}  {, , , }
defined by  (1) ,  (2) ,  (3) ,  (4) .

Example 0.3.14: Define the function  :    by  ()  sin(). Then  [0, 1/2] = [0, 1],
 -1 {0} = , etc.

Proposition 0.3.15. Consider  :   . Let ,  be subsets of . Then

                        -1(  ) =  -1()   -1(),

                        -1(  ) =  -1()   -1(),
                        -1() =  -1()  .

Read the last line of the proposition as  -1( \ ) =  \  -1().

Proof. We start with the union. If    -1(  ), then  is taken to  or , that is,
 ()   or  ()  . Thus  -1(  )   -1()   -1(). Conversely, if    -1(), then
   -1(  ). Similarly for    -1(). Hence  -1(  )   -1()   -1(), and we

have equality.

The rest of the proof is left as an exercise.                                              

    For direct images, the best we can do is the following weaker result.
Proposition 0.3.16. Consider  :   . Let ,  be subsets of . Then

                        (  ) =  ()   (),
                        (  )   ()   ().

    The proof is left as an exercise.

Definition 0.3.17. Let  :    be a function. The function  is said to be injective or
one-to-one if  (1) =  (2) implies 1 = 2. In other words,  is injective if for all   , the
set  -1({}) is empty or consists of a single element. We call such an  an injection.

    If  () = , then we say  is surjective or onto. In other words,  is surjective if the range
and the codomain of  are equal. We call such an  a surjection.

    If  is both surjective and injective, then we say  is bective or that  is a bection.
16  INTRODUCTION

    When  :    is a bection, then the inverse image of a single element,  -1({}), is
always a unique element of . We then consider  -1 as a function  -1 :    and we
write simply  -1(). In this case, we call  -1 the inverse function of  . For instance, for the
bection  :    defined by  () 3, we have  -1() = 3 .

Definition 0.3.18. Consider  :    and  :   . The composition of the functions 
and  is the function    :    defined as

                                             (   )()   () .

    For example, if  :    is  () 3 and  :    is () = sin(), then
(   )() = sin(3). It is left to the reader as an easy exercise to show that composition
of one-to-one maps is one-to-one and composition of onto maps is onto. Therefore, the
composition of bections is a bection.

0.3.4 Relations and equivalence classes

We often compare two objects in some way. For instance, we say 1 < 2 for natural numbers,
1/2 = 2/4 for rational numbers, or {, }  {, , } for sets. The `<', `=', and `' are examples
of relations.

Definition 0.3.19. Given a set , a binary relation on  is a subset R   × , which consists
of those pairs where the relation is said to hold. Instead of (, )  R, we write  R .

Example 0.3.20: Take  {1, 2, 3}.
    Consider the relation `<'. The corresponding set of pairs is (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3) . So

1 < 2 holds as (1, 2) is in the corresponding set of pairs, but 3 < 1 does not hold as (3, 1) is
not in the set.

    Similarly, the relation `=' is defined by the set of pairs (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) .
    Any subset of × is a relation. If we define the relation  via (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1) ,
then 1  2 and 3  1 are true, but 1  3 is not.

Definition 0.3.21. A relation R on a set  is said to be
   (i) Reflexive if  R  for all   .
  (ii) Symmetric if  R  implies  R .

 (iii) Transitive if  R  and  R  implies  R .

If R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, then it is said to be an equivalence relation.

Example 0.3.22: Let  {1, 2, 3}. The relation `<' is transitive but neither reflexive nor
symmetric. The relation `' defined by (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3) is reflexive
and transitive, but not symmetric. Finally, a relation `' defined by (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1),
(2, 2), (3, 3) is an equivalence relation.

    Equivalence relations are useful as they divide a set into sets of "equivalent" elements.
0.3. BASIC SET THEORY  17

Definition 0.3.23. Let  be a set and R an equivalence relation. An equivalence class of
  , often denoted by [], is the set {   :  R }.

    For example, given the relation `' above, there are two equivalence classes, [1] = [2] =
{1, 2} and [3] = {3}.

    Reflexivity guarantees that   []. Symmetry guarantees that if   [], then   [].
Finally, transitivity guarantees that if   [] and   [], then   []. In particular, we
have the following proposition, whose proof is an exercise.

Proposition 0.3.24. If R is an equivalence relation on a set , then every    is in exactly one
equivalence class. Moreover,  R  if and only if [] = [].

Example 0.3.25: The set of rational numbers can be defined as equivalence classes of a pair
of an integer and a natural number, that is, elements of  × . The relation is defined by
(, )  (, ) whenever  = . It is left as an exercise to prove that `' is an equivalence
relation. Usually, the equivalence class (, ) is written as /.

0.3.5 Cardinality

A subtle but fundamental issue in set theory and one that generates a considerable amount
of confusion among beginning students is that of cardinality, or "size" of sets. Indeed, in
this section, we will see the first really unexpected theorem.

Definition 0.3.26. Let  and  be sets. We say  and  have the same cardinality when
there exists a bection  :   . We denote by || the equivalence class of all sets with
the same cardinality as , and we simply call || the cardinality of .

    For example, {1, 2, 3} has the same cardinality as {, , } by defining a bection
 (1) ,  (2) ,  (3) . Clearly, the bection is not unique.

    The existence of a bection really is an equivalence relation. The identity function,
 () , is a bection showing reflexivity. If  is a bection, then so is  -1, showing
symmetry. If  :    and  :    are bections, then    is a bection of  and ,
showing transitivity. A set  has the same cardinality as the empty set if and only if 
itself is the empty set: If  is nonempty, then no function  :    can exist. In particular,
there is no bection of  and .

Definition 0.3.27. If  has the same cardinality as {1, 2, 3, . . . , } for some   , we write
|| . If  is empty, we write || 0. In either case, we say that  is finite. We say  is
infinite or "of infinite cardinality" if  is not finite.

    That the notation || =  is justified, we leave as an exercise. That is, for each nonempty
finite set , there exists a unique natural number  such that there exists a bection from 
to {1, 2, 3, . . . , }.

    We can order sets by size.
18                                   INTRODUCTION

Definition 0.3.28. We write

                             ||  ||

if there exists an injection from  to . We write || = || if  and  have the same
cardinality. We write || < || if ||  ||, but  and  do not have the same cardinality.

    We state without proof that  and  have the same cardinality if and only if ||  ||
and ||  ||. This is the so-called Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem. Furthermore, if 
and  are any two sets, we can always write ||  || or ||  ||. The issues surrounding
this last statement are very subtle. As we do not require either of these two statements, we
omit proofs.

    The truly interesting cases of cardinality are infinite sets. We will distinguish two types
of infinite cardinality.

Definition 0.3.29. If || = ||, then we say  is countably infinite. If  is finite or countably
infinite, then we say  is countable. If  is not countable, then  is said to be uncountable.

    The cardinality of  is usually denoted as 0 (read as aleph-naught).

Example 0.3.30: The set of even natural numbers has the same cardinality as . Proof: Let
   be the set of even natural numbers. Given   , write  = 2 for some   . Then
 () 2 defines a bection  :   .

    In fact, we mention without proof the following characterization of infinite sets: A set is
infinite if and only if it is in one-to-one correspondence with a proper subset of itself.

Example 0.3.31:  ×  is a countably infinite set. Proof: Arrange the elements of  ×  as
follows (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), . . . . That is, first write down all the elements
whose two entries sum to , then write down all the elements whose entries sum to  + 1,
and so on. Define a bection with  by letting 1 go to (1, 1), 2 go to (1, 2), and so on. See

Figure 4.

Example 0.3.32: The set of rational numbers is countable. Proof: (informal) For positive
rational numbers, follow the same procedure as in the previous example, writing 1/1, 1/2,
2/1, etc. However, leave out fractions (such as 2/2) that have already appeared. The list
would continue: 1/3, 3/1, 1/4, 2/3, etc. For all rational numbers, include 0 and the negative
numbers: 0, 1/1, -1/1, 1/2, -1/2, etc.

    For completeness, we mention the following statements from the exercises. If   
and  is countable, then  is countable. The contrapositive of the statement is that if 
is uncountable, then  is uncountable. As a consequence, if || < ||, then  is finite.
Similarly, if  is finite and   , then  is finite.

                                   (1, 1) (1, 2)  (1, 3)  (1, 4)

                                   (4, 1) . . .    ...
Figure 4: Showing  ×  is countable.

    We give the first truly striking result about cardinality. To do so, we need a notation for
the set of all subsets of a set.

Definition 0.3.33. The power set of a set , denoted by P(), is the set of all subsets of .

    For example, if  {1, 2}, then P() = , {1}, {2}, {1, 2} . In particular, || = 2 and
|P()| = 4 = 22. In general, for a finite set  of cardinality , the cardinality of P() is
2. This fact is left as an exercise. Hence, for a finite set , the cardinality of P() is
strictly larger than the cardinality of . What is an unexpected and striking fact is that this
statement is also true for infinite sets.

Theorem 0.3.34 (Cantor). Let  be a set. Then || < |P()|. In particular, there exists no
surjection from  onto P().

Proof. An injection  :   P() exists: For   , let  () {}. Thus, ||  |P()|.
    To finish the proof, we must show that no function  :   P() is a surjection.

Suppose  :   P() is a function. So for   , () is a subset of . Define the set

                           :   () .

We claim that  is not in the range of  and hence  is not a surjection. Suppose for

contradiction that there exists an 0 such that (0) = . Either 0   or 0  . If 0  ,
then 0  (0) = , which is a contradiction. If 0  , then 0  (0) = , which is again

a contradiction. Thus such an 0 does not exist. Therefore,  is not in the range of , and 

is not a surjection. As  was an arbitrary function, no surjection exists.                

    One particular consequence of this theorem is that there do exist uncountable sets,
as P() must be uncountable. A related fact is that the set of real numbers (which we

study in the next chapter) is uncountable. The existence of uncountable sets may seem

unintuitive, and the theorem caused quite a controversy at the time it was announced. The

theorem not only says that uncountable sets exist, but that there, in fact, exist progressively
larger and larger infinite sets , P(), P(P()), P(P(P())), etc.

Real Numbers

1.1 Basic properties

Note: 1.5 lectures
    In analysis, the main object we work with is the set of real numbers. As this set is

so fundamental, often much time is spent formally constructing the set of real numbers.
However, we take an easier approach, and we will assume that a set with the correct
properties exists. The three key properties of the real numbers is that it is an ordered set, it
is complete with respect to this order, and it is a field compatible with this order. We start
with order.

Definition 1.1.1. An ordered set is a set  together with a relation < such that
   (i) (trichotomy) For all ,   , exactly one of  < ,  = , or  <  holds.
  (ii) (transitivity) If , ,    are such that  <  and  < , then  < .

We write    if  <  or  = . We define > and  in the obvious way.

    The set of rational numbers  is an ordered set: We say  <  if and only if  -  is a
positive rational number, that is, if  -  = / where ,   . Similarly,  and  are also
ordered sets.

    There are other ordered sets than sets of numbers. For example, the set of countries can
be ordered by landmass, so India > Lichtenstein. A typical ordered set that you have used
since primary school is the dictionary. It is the ordered set of words where the order is the
so-called lexicographic ordering. Such ordered sets often appear, for example, in computer
science. In this book, we will mostly be interested in ordered sets of numbers.

Definition 1.1.2. Let   , where  is an ordered set.
   (i) If there exists a    such that    for all   , then we say  is bounded above and
         is an upper bound of .
  (ii) If there exists a    such that    for all   , then we say  is bounded below and
         is a lower bound of .
24             CHAPTER 1. REAL NUMBERS

(iii) If there exists an upper bound 0 of  such that 0   for all upper bounds  of ,
      then 0 is called the least upper bound or the supremum of . See Figure 1.1. We write

                                                     sup  0.

(iv) Similarly, if there exists a lower bound 0 of  such that 0   for all lower bounds 
      of , then 0 is called the greatest lower bound or the infimum of . We write

                                                      inf  0.

When a set  is both bounded above and bounded below, we say simply that  is bounded.
    The notation sup  and inf  is justified as the supremum (or infimum) is unique (if it

exists): If  and  are suprema of , then    and   , because both  and  are the
least upper bounds, so  = .

               upper bounds of 

    smaller                                                      bigger

               least upper bound of 

Figure 1.1: A set  bounded above and the least upper bound of .

    A simple example: Let  {, , , , } be ordered as  <  <  <  < , and let
 {, }. Then , , and  are upper bounds of , and  is the least upper bound or
supremum of .

    A supremum or infimum for  (even if it exists) need not be in . The set 
{   :  < 1} has a least upper bound of 1, but 1 is not in the set  itself. The set
 {   :   1} also has an upper bound of 1, and in this case 1  . The set
 {   :   0} has no upper bound (why?) and therefore cannot have a least upper
bound. The set  does have a greatest lower bound: 0.

Definition 1.1.3. An ordered set  has the least-upper-bound property if every nonempty
subset    that is bounded above has a least upper bound, that is, sup  exists in .

    The least-upper-bound property is sometimes called the completeness property or the
Dedekind completeness property. The real numbers have this property.

Example 1.1.4: The set  of rational numbers does not have the least-upper-bound
property. The subset {   : 2 < 2} does not have a supremum in . We will see later

     Named after the German mathematician Julius Wilhelm Richard Dedekind (1831-1916).
1.1. BASIC PROPERTIES  25

                                                  
(Example 1.2.3) that the supremum is 2, which is not rational. Suppose    such that
2 = 2. Write  = / in lowest terms. So (/)2 = 2 or 2 = 22. Hence, 2 is divisible by
2, and so  is divisible by 2. Write  = 2 and so (2)2 = 22. Divide by 2 and note that
22 = 2, and hence  is divisible by 2. But that is a contradiction as / is in lowest terms.

    That  does not have the least-upper-bound property is one of the most important
reasons we work with  in analysis. The set  is just fine for algebraists. But us analysts
require the least-upper-bound property to do any work. We also require our real numbers
to have many algebraic properties. In particular, we require that they be a field.

Definition 1.1.5. A set  is called a field if it has two operations defined on it, addition  + 
and multiplication , and if it satisfies the following axioms:
(A1) If    and   , then  +   .
(A2) (commutativity of addition)  +  =  +  for all ,   .
(A3) (associativity of addition) ( + ) +  =  + ( + ) for all , ,   .
(A4) There exists an element 0   such that 0 +  =  for all   .
(A5) For every element   , there exists an element -   such that  + (-) = 0.

(M1) If    and   , then   .
(M2) (commutativity of multiplication)  =  for all ,   .
(M3) (associativity of multiplication) () = () for all , ,   .
(M4) There exists an element 1   (and 1  0) such that 1 =  for all   .
(M5) For every    such that   0 there exists an element 1/   such that (1/) = 1.

  (D) (distributive law) ( + ) =  +  for all , ,   .

Example 1.1.6: The set  of rational numbers is a field. On the other hand  is not a field,
as it does not contain multiplicative inverses. For example, there is no    such that
2 = 1, so (M5) is not satisfied. You can check that (M5) is the only property that fails.

    We will assume the basic facts about fields that are easily proved from the axioms. For
example, 0 = 0 is easily proved by noting that  = (0 + ) = 0 + , using (A4), (D),
and (M2). Then using (A5) on , along with (A2), (A3), and (A4), we obtain 0 = 0.

Definition 1.1.7. A field  is said to be an ordered field if  is also an ordered set such that

   (i) For , ,   ,  <  implies  +  <  + .

  (ii) For ,   ,  > 0 and  > 0 implies  > 0.

If  > 0, we say  is positive. If  < 0, we say  is negative. We also say  is nonnegative if
  0, and  is nonpositive if   0.

     This is true for all other roots of 2, and interestingly, the fact that  2 is never rational for  > 1 implies
no piano can ever be perfectly tuned in all keys. See, for example: https://youtu.be/1Hqm0dYKUx4.

    An algebraist would say that  is an ordered ring, or perhaps a commutative ordered ring.
26                                                       CHAPTER 1. REAL NUMBERS

    The rational numbers  with the standard ordering is an ordered field. We leave the
details to the interested reader.
Proposition 1.1.8. Let  be an ordered field and , , ,   . Then

   (i) If  > 0, then - < 0 (and vice versa).
  (ii) If  > 0 and  < , then  < .
 (iii) If  < 0 and  < , then  > .
 (iv) If   0, then 2 > 0.
  (v) If 0 <  < , then 0 < 1/ < 1/.
 (vi) If 0 <  < , then 2 < 2.
(vii) If    and   , then  +    + .

    Note that (iv) implies, in particular, that 1 > 0.

Proof. Let us prove (i). The inequality  > 0 implies by item (i) of the definition of ordered
fields that  + (-) > 0 + (-). Apply the algebraic properties of fields to obtain 0 > -.

The "vice versa" follows by a similar calculation.
    For (ii), note that  <  implies 0 <  -  by item (i) of the definition of ordered fields.

Apply item (ii) of the definition of ordered fields to obtain 0 < ( - ). By algebraic
properties, 0 <  - . Again by item (i) of the definition,  < .

    Part (iii) is left as an exercise.
    To prove part (iv), first suppose  > 0. By item (ii) of the definition of ordered fields,
2 > 0 (use  = ). If  < 0, we use part (iii) of this proposition, where we plug in  = 
and  = 0.
    To prove part (v), notice that 1/ cannot be equal to zero (why?). Suppose 1/ < 0, then
-1/ > 0 by (i). Apply part (ii) of the definition (as  > 0) to obtain (-1/) > 0 or -1 > 0,
which contradicts 1 > 0 by using part (i) again. Hence 1/ > 0. Similarly, 1/ > 0. Thus
(1/)(1/) > 0 by definition of ordered field, and by part (ii),

                                   (1/)(1/) < (1/)(1/).

By algebraic properties, 1/ < 1/.

    Parts (vi) and (vii) are left as exercises.            

    The product of two positive numbers (elements of an ordered field) is positive (follows
by setting  = 0 in (ii)). However, it is not true that if the product is positive, then each of
the two factors must be positive. For instance, (-1)(-1) = 1 > 0.

Proposition 1.1.9. Let ,   , where  is an ordered field. If  > 0, then either both  and 

are positive, or both are negative.

Proof. We show the contrapositive: If either one of  or  is zero, or if  and  have opposite

signs, then  is not positive. If  or  is zero, then  is zero and hence not positive.

Hence assume that  and  are nonzero and have opposite signs. Without loss of generality,

suppose  > 0 and  < 0. Multiply  < 0 by  to get  < 0 = 0.  
1.1. BASIC PROPERTIES  27

Example 1.1.10: The reader may have heard about the complex numbers, usually denoted by
. That is,  is the set of numbers of the form  + , where  and  are real numbers, and
 is the imaginary number, a number such that 2 = -1. The reader may remember from
algebra that  is also a field; however, it is not an ordered field. While one can make  into
an ordered set in some way, it is not possible to put an order on  that would make it an
ordered field: In every ordered field, -1 < 0 and 2 > 0 for all nonzero , but in , 2 = -1.

    Finally, an ordered field that has the least-upper-bound property has the corresponding
property for greatest lower bounds.

Proposition 1.1.11. Let  be an ordered field with the least-upper-bound property. Let    be
a nonempty set that is bounded below. Then inf  exists.

Proof. Let  {- :   }. Let    be a lower bound for : If   , then    and
hence -  -. So - is an upper bound for . Since  has the least-upper-bound property,
 sup  exists, and   -. As    for all   , then -   for all   . So - is a
lower bound for . As -  , the greatest lower bound of  exists and equals -.

1.2 The set of real numbers

Note: 2 lectures, the extended real numbers are optional

1.2.1 The set of real numbers

We finally get to the real number system. To simplify matters, instead of constructing the
real number set from the rational numbers, we simply state their existence as a theorem
without proof. Notice that  is an ordered field.

Theorem 1.2.1. There exists a unique ordered field  with the least-upper-bound property such
that   .

    Note also that   . We saw that 1 > 0. By induction (exercise), we can prove that
 > 0 for all   . Similarly, we verify simple statements about rational numbers. For
example, we proved that if  > 0, then 1/ > 0. Then  <  implies / < /.

    Analysis consists of proving inequalities, and the following proposition, or one of its
many variations, is how an analyst proves a nonstrict inequality.

Proposition 1.2.2. If    is such that    for all    where  > 0, then   0.

Proof. If  > 0, then 0 < /2 <  (why?). Take  = /2 to get a contradiction. Thus   0. 

For nonnegative , equality results: If   0 is such that    for all  > 0, then  = 0. A

common version uses the absolute value (see §1.3): If ||   for all  > 0, then  = 0. To

prove   0, an analyst might prove that   - for all  > 0. From now on, when we say

  0 or  > 0, we automatically mean that    and   .

The idea behind the proposition above is that any time we have two real numbers  < ,

there is another real number  such that  <  < . Infinitely many such  exist. One of
                               +
them  is,  for  example,    =   2  (why?).  We  will  use  this  fact  in  the  next  example.

The most useful property of  for analysts is not just that it is an ordered field, but that

it has the least-upper-bound property. Essentially, we want , but we also want to take

suprema (and infima) willy-nilly. So what we do is take  and throw in enough numbers

to obtain .

    We mentioned already that  contains elements that are not in  because of the
least-upper-bound property. Let us prove it. We saw there is no rational square root of
two. The set {   : 2 < 2} implies the existence of the real number 2, although this
fact requires a bit of work. See also Exercise 1.2.14.

                                                                                                                  
Example 1.2.3: Claim: There exists a unique positive    such that 2 = 2. We denote  by 2.

     Uniqueness is up to isomorphism, but we wish to avoid excessive use of algebra. For us, it is simply
enough to assume that a set of real numbers exists. See Rudin [R2] for the construction and more details.
30                                                                                 CHAPTER 1. REAL NUMBERS

Proof. Take the set  {   : 2 < 2}. We first show that  is bounded above and

nonempty. The inequality   2 implies 2  4 (see Exercise 1.1.3). So if 2 < 2, then  < 2.

So  is bounded above. As 1  , the set  is nonempty. The supremum, therefore, exists.

    Let  sup . We will show that 2 = 2 by showing that 2  2 and 2  2. This is the

way analysts show equality, by showing two inequalities. We already know that   1 > 0.

    In the following, it may seem we are pulling certain expressions out of a hat. When

writing a proof such as this, we would, of course, come up with the expressions only after

playing around with what we wish to prove. The order in which we write the proof is not

necessarily the order in which we come up with the proof.

    Let us first show that 2  2. Take a positive number  such that 2 < 2. We wish to find

an     >    0  such   that  (   +   )2    <   2.  As  2-  2  >   0,  we    have    2-2   >  0.    Choose  an          such
                                                                                   2+1
                   2-2
that   0  <     <          Furthermore,           assume     <   1.  Estimate,
                   2+1 .

                               ( + )2 - 2 = (2 + )                         since  < 1
                                               < (2 + 1)
                                               < 2 - 2                                       2-2

                                                                           since  < 2+1 .

Therefore, ( + )2 < 2. Hence  +   , but as  > 0, we have  +  > . So  <  = sup .

As  was an arbitrary positive number such that 2 < 2, it follows that 2  2.

    Now take a positive number  such that 2 > 2. We wish to find an  > 0 such that

(   -  )2    >  2  and     -    is  still  positive.  As     2   -   2  >  0,  we  have  2-2      >  0.  Let      2-2
                                                                                          2
                           2-2             1                                                                       2 , and
                            2       2      
check       -      =    -       =      +      >   0.  Estimate,

                           2 - ( - )2 = 2  - 2                       since 2 > 0 as   0
                                           < 2
                                           = 2 - 2                                     2-2

                                                                     since  = 2 .

By subtracting 2 from both sides and multiplying by -1, we find ( - )2 > 2. Therefore,
 -   .

    Moreover, if    - , then 2  ( - )2 > 2 (as  > 0 and  -  > 0) and so   .
Thus,  -  is an upper bound for . However,  -  < , or in other words,  >  = sup .
Hence, 2  2.

    Together, 2  2 and 2  2 imply 2 = 2. The existence part is finished. We still need to

handle uniqueness. Suppose    such that 2 = 2 and  > 0. Thus, 2 = 2. However, if

0 <  < , then 2 < 2. Similarly, 0 <  <  implies 2 < 2. Hence,  = .

that  \  is nonempty. Not only is it nonempty, as we will see, it is very large indeed.
    Using the same technique as above, we can show that a positive real number 1/ exists

for all    and all  > 0. That is, for each  > 0, there exists a unique positive real
number  such that  = . The proof is left as an exercise.

1.2.2 Archimedean property

As we have seen, there are plenty of real numbers in any interval. But there are also
infinitely many rational numbers in any interval. The following is one of the fundamental
facts about the real numbers. The two parts of the next theorem are actually equivalent,
even though it may not seem like that at first sight.

Theorem 1.2.4.
   (i) (Archimedean property) If ,    and  > 0, then there exists an    such that

                                                           > .

  (ii) ( is dense in ) If ,    and  < , then there exists an    such that  <  < .

Proof. Let us prove (i). Divide through by . Then (i) says that for every real number
 /, we can find    such that  > . In other words, (i) says that    is not
bounded above. Suppose for contradiction that  is bounded above. Let  sup . The
number  - 1 cannot possibly be an upper bound for  as it is strictly less than  (the
least upper bound). Thus there exists an    such that  >  - 1. Add one to obtain
 + 1 > , contradicting  being an upper bound.

-1                                 +1
                                   

                              1
                              

                                 

Figure 1.2: Idea of the proof of the density of : Find  such that  -  > 1/, then take the
least  such that / > .

    Let us tackle (ii). See Figure 1.2 for a picture of the idea behind the proof. First assume
  0. Note that  -  > 0. By (i), there exists an    such that

                                    ( - ) > 1 or  -  > 1/.

Again by (i) the set  {   :  > } is nonempty. By the well ordering property of ,
 has a least element , and as   , then  > . Divide through by  to get  < /.
As  is the least element of ,  - 1  . If  > 1, then  - 1  , but  - 1   and so
 - 1  . If  = 1, then  - 1 = 0, and  - 1   still holds as   0. In other words,

                                     - 1   or    + 1.

On the other hand, from ( - ) > 1 we obtain  > 1 + . Hence  > 1 +   , and
therefore  > /. Putting everything together, we obtain  < / < . So take  = /.

     Named after the Ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 BC - c. 212 BC). This
property is Axiom V from Archimedes' "On the Sphere and Cylinder" 225 BC.
32                                                CHAPTER 1. REAL NUMBERS

    Now assume  < 0. If  > 0, then just take  = 0. If   0, then 0  - < -, and we

find a rational  such that - <  < -. Then take  = -.                                   

    Let us state and prove a simple but useful corollary of the Archimedean property.
Corollary 1.2.5. inf{1/ :   } = 0. See Figure 1.3.

Proof. Let  {1/ :   }. Obviously,  is not empty. Furthermore, 1/ > 0 for all   ,

so 0 is a lower bound and  inf  exists. As 0 is a lower bound, then   0. Take an

arbitrary  > 0. By the Archimedean property, there exists an  such that  > 1, that is,

 > 1/  . Therefore,  cannot be a lower bound for . Hence  = 0.

1.2.3 Using supremum and infimum

Suprema and infima are compatible with algebraic operations. For a set    and   
define

    +                  { +    :   },
                       {   :   }.

For example, if  = {1, 2, 3}, then 5 +  = {6, 7, 8} and 3 = {3, 6, 9}.

Proposition 1.2.6. Let    be nonempty.
   (i) If    and  is bounded above, then sup( + ) =  + sup .
  (ii) If    and  is bounded below, then inf( + ) =  + inf .

 (iii) If  > 0 and  is bounded above, then sup() = (sup ).
 (iv) If  > 0 and  is bounded below, then inf() = (inf ).
  (v) If  < 0 and  is bounded below, then sup() = (inf ).
 (vi) If  < 0 and  is bounded above, then inf() = (sup ).

    Do note that multiplying a set by a negative number switches supremum for an infimum
and vice versa. Also, as the proposition implies that supremum (resp. infimum) of  +  or
 exists, it also implies that  +  or  is nonempty and bounded above (resp. below).

Proof. Let us only prove the first statement. The rest are left as exercises.
1.2. THE SET OF REAL NUMBERS                   33

    Suppose  is an upper bound for . That is,    for all   . Then  +    +  for
all   , and so  +  is an upper bound for  + . In particular, if  = sup , then

                     sup( + )   +  =  + sup .

    The opposite inequality is similar: If  is an upper bound for  + , then  +    for
all    and so    -  for all   . So  -  is an upper bound for . If  = sup( + ),

then
                                     sup    -  = sup( + ) - .

The result follows.                            

    Sometimes we need to apply supremum or infimum twice. Here is an example.

Proposition 1.2.7. Let ,    be nonempty sets such that    whenever    and   .
Then  is bounded above,  is bounded below, and sup   inf .

Proof. Any    is a lower bound for . Therefore,   inf  for all   , so inf  is an

upper bound for . Hence, sup   inf .           

    We must be careful about strict inequalities and taking suprema and infima. Note
that  <  whenever    and    still only implies sup   inf , and not a strict
inequality. For example, take  {0} and  {1/ :   }. Then 0 < 1/ for all   .
However, sup  = 0 and inf  = 0. This important subtle point comes up often.

    The proof of the following often used fact is left to the reader. A similar result holds for
infima.

Proposition 1.2.8. If    is nonempty and bounded above, then for every  > 0 there exists an
   such that (sup ) -  <   sup .

    To make using suprema and infima even easier, we may want to write sup  and inf 
without worrying about  being bounded and nonempty. We make the following natural
definitions.

Definition 1.2.9. Let    be a set.
   (i) If  is empty, then sup  -.
  (ii) If  is not bounded above, then sup  .

 (iii) If  is empty, then inf  .
 (iv) If  is not bounded below, then inf  -.

    For convenience,  and - are sometimes treated as if they were numbers, except we
do not allow arbitrary arithmetic with them. We make    {-, } into an ordered
set by letting

- <  and -  <  and  <  for all   .
34                                                         CHAPTER 1. REAL NUMBERS

The set  is called the set of extended real numbers. It is possible to define some arithmetic
on . Most operations are extended in an obvious way, but we must leave  - , 0 · (±),
     ±
and  ±  undefined.  We refrain from using this arithmetic, it leads to easy mistakes as
 is not a field. Now we can take suprema and infima without fear of emptiness or
unboundedness. In this book, we mostly avoid using  outside of exercises and leave

such generalizations to the interested reader.

1.2.4 Maxima and minima

By Exercise 1.1.2, a finite set of numbers always has a supremum and an infimum and
they are both contained in the set itself. In this case, we usually do not use the words
supremum or infimum. When a set  of real numbers is bounded above and sup   ,
we can use the word maximum and the notation max  to denote the supremum. Similarly
for infimum: When  is bounded below and inf   , we can use the word minimum and
the notation min . For example,

                                          max{1, 2.4, , 100} = 100,
                                          min{1, 2.4, , 100} = 1.

While writing sup and inf may be technically correct in this situation, max and min are
generally used to emphasize that the supremum or infimum is in the set itself, especially
when the set is finite.

1.3 Absolute value and bounded functions

Note: 0.5-1 lecture
    A concept we will encounter over and over is the concept of absolute value. You want to

think of the absolute value as the "size" of a real number. Here is the formal definition:

                                             ||  if   0,
                                                       - if  < 0.

Let us give the main features of the absolute value as a proposition.

Proposition 1.3.1.
   (i) ||  0, moreover, || = 0 if and only if  = 0.
  (ii) |-| = || for all   .

 (iii)  = ||  for all ,   .
 (iv) ||2 = 2 for all   .
  (v) ||   if and only if -    .
 (vi) - ||    || for all   .

Proof. (i): First suppose   0. Then || =   0. Also, || =  = 0 if and only if  = 0. On
the other hand, if  < 0, then || = - > 0, and || is never zero.

    (ii): If  > 0, then - < 0 and so |-| = -(-) =  = ||. Similarly when  < 0, or  = 0.

    (iii): If  or  is zero, then the result is immediate. When  and  are both positive,
then ||  = . As  is also positive,  =  . If  and  are both negative, then
  = (-)(-) is still positive and  = . Also, ||  = (-)(-) = . If  > 0 and
 < 0, then ||  = (-) = -(). Now  is negative and  = -(). Similarly when
 < 0 and  > 0.

    (iv): Immediate if   0. If  < 0, then ||2 = (-)2 = 2.

    (v): Suppose ||  . If   0, then   . It follows that   0, leading to -  0  .
So -     holds. If  < 0, then ||   means -  . Negating both sides we get
  -. Again   0 and so   0 > . Hence, -    .

    On the other hand, suppose -     is true. If   0, then    is equivalent to
||  . If  < 0, then -   implies (-)  , which is equivalent to ||  .

    (vi): Apply (v) with  = ||.                                        

    A property used frequently enough to give it a name is the so-called triangle inequality.
Proposition 1.3.2 (Triangle Inequality). | + |  || + || for all ,   .
1.3. ABSOLUTE VALUE AND BOUNDED FUNCTIONS                                             37

Proof. Proposition 1.3.1 gives -||    || and -||    ||. Add these two inequalities

to obtain
                                      - || + ||   +   || + ||.

Apply Proposition 1.3.1 again to find | + |  || + ||.                                 

    There are other often applied versions of the triangle inequality.
Corollary 1.3.3. Let ,   .

   (i) (reverse triangle inequality) (|| -  )   -  .
  (ii)  -   || +  .

Proof. Let us plug in  =  -  and  =  into the standard triangle inequality to obtain

|| = | -  + |  | - | + || ,

or || - ||  | - |. Switching the roles of  and  we find || - ||  | - | = | - |.

Applying Proposition 1.3.1, we obtain the reverse triangle inequality.

The second item in the corollary is obtained from the standard triangle inequality by

just replacing  with -, and noting - =  .                                             

Corollary 1.3.4. Let 1, 2, . . . ,   . Then

|1 + 2 + · · · + |  |1| + |2| + · · · + || .

Proof. We proceed by induction. The conclusion holds trivially for  = 1, and for  = 2 it is
the standard triangle inequality. Suppose the corollary holds for . Take  + 1 numbers
1, 2, . . . , +1 and first use the standard triangle inequality, then the induction hypothesis

|1 + 2 + · · · +  + +1|  |1 + 2 + · · · + | + |+1|

 |1| + |2| + · · · + || + |+1|.                                                       

Let us see an example of the use of the triangle inequality.

Example 1.3.5: Find a number  such that |2 - 9 + 1|   for all -1    5.
    Using the triangle inequality, write

|2 - 9 + 1|  |2| + |9| + |1| = ||2 + 9|| + 1.

The expression ||2 + 9|| + 1 is largest when || is largest (why?). In the interval provided,
|| is largest when  = 5 and so || = 5. One possibility for  is

 = 52 + 9(5) + 1 = 71.

There are, of course, other  that work. The bound of 71 is much higher than it need be,
but we didn't ask for the best possible , just one that works.

The last example leads us to the concept of bounded functions.
38                                         CHAPTER 1. REAL NUMBERS

Definition 1.3.6. Suppose  :    is a function. We say  is bounded if there exists a
number  such that  ()   for all   .

    In the example, we proved 2 - 9 + 1 is bounded when considered as a function on
 = { : -1    5}. On the other hand, if we consider the same polynomial as a function
on the whole real line , then it is not bounded.

                                        sup ( )
                                              ()

                                         inf ( )
                                 -

Figure 1.4: Example of a bounded function, a bound , and its supremum and infimum.

    For a function  :   , we write (see Figure 1.4 for an example)

        sup  () sup  () and inf  () inf  ().
                                         
        

We also sometimes replace the "  " with an expression. For example if, as before,
 () = 2 - 9 + 1, for -1    5, a little bit of calculus shows

      sup  () = sup (2 - 9 + 1) = 11,  inf  () = inf (2 - 9 + 1) = -77/4.

              ()  () for all   ,

then

        sup  ()  sup () and              inf  ()  inf ().                           (1.1)
                                           
             

    Be careful with the variables. The  on the left side of the inequality in (1.1) is different

from the  on the right. You should really think of, say, the first inequality as

               sup  ()  sup ().

                                       

Let us prove this inequality. If  is an upper bound for (), then  ()  ()   for all
  , and hence  is also an upper bound for  (), or  ()   for all   . Take the
least upper bound of () to get that for all   

                ()  sup ().

                           

     The boundedness hypothesis is for simplicity, it can be dropped if we allow for the extended real
numbers.
1.3. ABSOLUTE VALUE AND BOUNDED FUNCTIONS                                         39

Therefore, sup () is an upper bound for  () and thus greater than or equal to the
least upper bound of  ().

                         sup  ()  sup ().

                                             

The second inequality (the statement about the inf) is left as an exercise (Exercise 1.3.4).

A common mistake is to conclude

                         sup  ()  inf ().                                         (1.2)
                                             
                         

The inequality (1.2) is not true given the hypothesis of the proposition above. For this
stronger inequality we need the stronger hypothesis

                        ()  () for all    and   .

The proof as well as a counterexample is left as an exercise (Exercise 1.3.5).

1.4. INTERVALS AND THE SIZE OF                                     41

1.4 Intervals and the size of 

Note: 0.5-1 lecture (proof of uncountability of  can be optional)

    You surely saw the notation for intervals before, but let us give a formal definition here.
For ,    such that  < , we define

[, ]   {   :     },
(, )   {   :  <  < },
(, ]   {   :  <   },
[, )   {   :    < }.

The interval [, ] is called a closed interval and (, ) is called an open interval. The intervals
of the form (, ] and [, ) are called half-open intervals.

    The intervals above are bounded intervals, since both  and  are real numbers. We define

unbounded intervals,

[, )                             {   :   },
(, )                             {   :  < },
(-, ]
(-, )                             {   :   },
                                  {   :  < }.

For completeness, we define (-, ) . The intervals [, ), (-, ], and  are
sometimes called unbounded closed intervals, and (, ), (-, ), and  are sometimes called

unbounded open intervals.

    The proof of the following proposition is left as an exercise. In short, an interval is a set
with at least two points that contains all points between any two points.

Proposition 1.4.1. A set    is an interval if and only if  contains at least 2 points and for all
,    and    such that  <  < , we have   .

    We have already seen that every open interval (, ) (where  <  of course) must be
nonempty. For example, it contains the number 2+ . An unexpected fact is that from a
set-theoretic perspective, all intervals have the same "size," that is, they all have the same
cardinality. For instance, the map  () 2 takes the interval [0, 1] bectively to the
interval [0, 2].

    Maybe more interestingly, the function  () tan() is a bective map from (-/2, /2)
to . Hence the bounded interval (-/2, /2) has the same cardinality as . It is not
completely straightforward to construct a bective map from [0, 1] to (0, 1), but it is

possible.

    And do not worry, there does exist a way to measure the "size" of subsets of real
numbers that "sees" the difference between [0, 1] and [0, 2]. However, its proper definition

requires much more machinery than we have right now.

     Sometimes single point sets and the empty set are also called intervals, but in this book, intervals have
at least 2 points. That is, we only defined the bounded intervals if  < .
42  CHAPTER 1. REAL NUMBERS

    Let us say more about the cardinality of intervals and hence about the cardinality of .
We have seen that there exist irrational numbers, that is  \ , is nonempty. The question
is: How many irrational numbers are there? It turns out there are a lot more irrational
numbers than rational numbers. We have seen that  is countable, and we will show
that  is uncountable. In fact, the cardinality of  is the same as the cardinality of P(),
although we will not prove this claim here.

Theorem 1.4.2 (Cantor).  is uncountable.

    We give a version of Cantor's original proof from 1874 as this proof requires the least
setup. Normally this proof is stated as a contradiction, but a proof by contrapositive is
easier to understand.

Proof. Let    be a countably infinite subset such that for every pair of real numbers
 < , there is an    such that  <  < . Were  countable, we could take  = . We
will show that  is necessarily a proper subset, and so  cannot equal , and  must be
uncountable.

    As  is countably infinite, there is a bection from  to . We write  as a sequence of
real numbers 1, 2, 3, . . ., such that each number in  is given by  for some   .

    We inductively construct two sequences of real numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . and 1, 2, 3, . . ..
Let 1 1 and 1 1 + 1. Note that 1 < 1 and 1  (1, 1). For some  > 1, suppose
1, 2, . . . , -1 and 1, 2, . . . , -1 have been defined, suppose 1 < 2 < · · · < -1 <
-1 < · · · < 2 < 1, and suppose for each  = 1, 2, . . . ,  - 1, we have   ( , ) for
 = 1, 2, . . . , .

   (i) Define  , where  is the smallest    such that   (-1, -1). Such an 
       exists by our assumption on , and    by the assumption on (-1, -1).

  (ii) Next, define  to be some real number in ( , -1).

Notice that -1 <  <  < -1. Also notice that ( , ) does not contain  and hence
does not contain  for  = 1, 2, . . . , . The two sequences are now defined.

    Claim:  <  for all  and  in . Proof: Let us first assume  < . Then
 < +1 < · · · < -1 <  < . Similarly for  > . The claim follows.

    Let  { :   } and  { :   }. By Proposition 1.2.7 and the claim above,

                                                 sup   inf .

Define  sup . The number  cannot be a member of : If  =  for some , then
 < +1, which is impossible. Similarly,  cannot be a member of . Therefore,  <  for
all    and  <  for all   . In other words, for every   , we have   ( , ).
By the construction of the sequence,   ( , ), and so   . As this was true for all
  , we have that   .

    We have constructed a real number  that is not in , and thus  is a proper subset of
. The sequence 1, 2, . . . cannot contain all elements of  and thus  is uncountable.

1.5 Decimal representation of the reals

Note: 1 lecture (optional)

    We often think of real numbers as their decimal representation. By a (decimal) digit,
we mean an integer between 0 and 9. For a positive integer , we find the digits
 , -1, . . . , 2, 1, 0 for some  (each  an integer between 0 and 9) such that

                     = 10 + -110-1 + · · · + 2102 + 110 + 0.

We often assume   0 (avoiding leading zeros). To represent , we write the sequence of
digits:  =  -1 · · · 210.

    Similarly, we represent some rational numbers. That is, for certain numbers , we can
find a negative integer -, a positive integer , and digits  , -1, . . . , 1, 0, -1, . . . , -,

such that

 = 10 + -110-1 + · · · + 2102 + 110 + 0 + -110-1 + -210-2 + · · · + -10- .

We write  =  -1 · · · 10 . -1-2 · · · -.
    Not every real number has such a representation, even the simple rational number 1/3

does not. The irrational number 2 does not have such a representation either. To get a
representation for all real numbers, we must allow infinitely many digits.

    Let us consider only real numbers in the interval (0, 1]. If we find a representation
for these, adding integers to them obtains a representation for all real numbers. Take an
infinite sequence of decimal digits:

                              0.123 . . . .

That is, we have a digit  for every   . We renumbered the digits to avoid the negative
signs. We call the number

                              1 2 3              
                              + 2 + 3 +···+ .
                              10 10 10           10

the truncation of  to  decimal digits. We say this sequence of digits represents a real

number  if                  1 2 3            

                     = sup + 2 + 3 + · · · +     = sup .
                             10 10 10        10
                                                     

Proposition 1.5.1.

(i) Every infinite sequence of digits 0.123 . . . represents a unique real number   [0, 1],
     and
                                       + 10 1 for all   .

(ii) For every   (0, 1] there exists an infinite sequence of digits 0.123 . . . that represents .
     There exists a unique representation such that

                             <    + 10 1 for all   .
1.5. DECIMAL REPRESENTATION OF THE REALS                                        45

Proof. We start with the first item. Take an arbitrary infinite sequence of digits 0.123 . . ..
Use the geometric sum formula to write

           1 2 3                      9 9 9          9
 = + 2 + 3 + · · · +   + 2 + 3 + · · · + 
           10 10 10              10 10 10 10         10

                                     = 9 1 + 1/10 + (1/10)2 + · · · + (1/10)-1
                                        10

                                     = 9 1 - (1/10) = 1 - (1/10) < 1.
                                        10 1 - 1/10

In particular,  < 1 for all . A sum of nonnegative numbers is nonnegative so   0,

and hence

                                 0  sup   1.

                                        

Therefore, 0.123 . . . represents a unique number  sup   [0, 1]. As  is a
supremum, then   . Take   . If  < , then  -   0. If  > , then

computing as above

           +1 +2 +3                            10 1  1 - (1/10)-  < 10 1 .
 -  = +1 + +2 + +3 + · · · + 
           10       10           10  10

Take the supremum over  to find

                                                  -   10 1 .
    We move on to the second item. Take any   (0, 1]. First let us tackle the existence.
For convenience, let 0 0. Then, 0 <   0 + 10-0. Suppose we defined the digits
1, 2, . . . , , and that  <    + 10-, for  = 0, 1, 2, . . . , . We need to define +1.
    By the Archimedean property of the real numbers, find an integer  such that  -  
10-(+1). Take the least such  and obtain

                    ( - 1)10-(+1) <  -   10-(+1).                               (1.3)

Let +1  - 1. As  < , then +1 =  - 1  0. On the other hand, since  -   10-,
we have that  is at most 10, and therefore +1  9. So +1 is a decimal digit. Since
+1 =  + +110-(+1) add  to the inequality (1.3) above:

+1 =  + ( - 1)10-(+1) <    + 10-(+1)
                                              =  + ( - 1)10-(+1) + 10-(+1) = +1 + 10-(+1).

And so +1 <   +1 + 10-(+1) holds. We inductively defined an infinite sequence of
digits 0.123 . . ..

    Consider  <    + 10-. As  <  for all , then sup{ :   }  . The
second inequality for  implies

                                - sup{ :   }   -   10-.
46                                                                    CHAPTER 1. REAL NUMBERS

As the inequality holds for all  and 10- can be made arbitrarily small (see Exercise 1.5.8),
we have   sup{ :   }. Therefore, sup{ :   } = .

    What is left to show is the uniqueness. Suppose 0.123 . . . is another representation of
. Let  be the -digit truncation of 0.123 . . ., and suppose  <    + 10- for all
  . Suppose for some   ,  =  for all  < , so -1 = -1. Then

                  = -1 + 10- <    + 10- = -1 + 10- + 10- .

Subtracting -1 and multiplying by 10 we get

                                         < ( - -1)10   + 1.

Similarly,                        < ( - -1)10   + 1.

Hence, both  and  are the largest integer  such that  < ( - -1)10, and therefore

 = . That is, the representation is unique.                                                                 

    The representation is not unique if we do not require  <  for all . For example, for
the number 1/2, the method in the proof obtains the representation

                                         0.49999 . . . .

However, 1/2 also has the representation 0.50000 . . ..
    The only numbers that have nonunique representations are ones that end in an infinite

sequence of 0s or an infinite sequence of 9s, because the only representation for which
 =  is one where all digits past the th digit are zero. In this case, there are exactly two
representations of  (see the exercises).

    Let us give another proof of the uncountability of the reals using decimal representations.
This is Cantor's second proof, which is probably better known. This proof may seem
shorter, but it is because we already did the hard part above and we are left with a slick
trick to prove that  is uncountable. This trick is called Cantor diagonalization and finds use
in other proofs as well.

Theorem 1.5.2 (Cantor). The set (0, 1] is uncountable.

Proof. Let  {1, 2, 3, . . .} be any countable subset of real numbers in (0, 1]. We will
construct a real number not in . Let

Let  be the -digit truncation of  = 0.123 . . .. Because all the digits are nonzero we
get  < +1  . Therefore,

                                               <    + 10-

for all , and the representation is the unique one for  from the proposition. For every

, the th digit of  is different from the th digit of , so   . Therefore   , and
as  was an arbitrary countable subset, (0, 1] must be uncountable. See Figure 1.5 for an

example.

    Using decimal digits we can also find lots of numbers that are not rational. The following
proposition is true for every rational number, but we give it only for   (0, 1] for simplicity.

Proposition 1.5.3. If   (0, 1] is a rational number and  = 0.123 . . ., then the decimal digits
eventually start repeating. That is, there are positive integers  and , such that for all   ,
 = +.

Proof. Suppose  = / for positive integers  and . Suppose also that  is a number with
a unique representation, as otherwise we have seen above that both its representations are
repeating, see also Exercise 1.5.3. This also means that   1 so  < .

    To compute the first digit, we take 10 and divide by . Let 1 be the quotient, and the
remainder 1 is some integer between 0 and  - 1. That is, 1 is the largest integer such that
1  10 and then 1 = 10 - 1. As  < , then 1 < 10, so 1 is a digit. Furthermore,

                                       1 10   = 1 10 + 1 10  1 10 + 110 .

The first inequality is strict since  has a unique representation. That is, 1 really is the first
digit. What is left is 1/(10). This is the same as computing the first digit of 1/. To compute
2 divide 101 by , and so on. After computing  - 1 digits, we have / = -1 + -1/(10-1).
To get the th digit, divide 10-1 by  to get quotient , remainder , and the inequalities

                                      10  -1  =  10 +  10   10 + 110 .

Dividing by 10-1 and adding -1 we find
                                    -1 + 10-1 -1  =    + 10 1 .

By uniqueness, we really have the th digit  from the construction.

    The new digit depends only the remainder from the previous step. There are at most 

possible remainders. Hence, the process must start repeating itself after at most  steps,

and so  is at most .                                                                                                 

    The converse of the proposition is also true and is left as an exercise.

Example 1.5.4: The number

                                   = 0.101001000100001000001 . . .

is irrational. That is, the digits are  zeros, then a one, then  + 1 zeros, then a one, and so
on and so forth. The fact that  is irrational follows from the proposition; the digits never
start repeating. For every , if we go far enough, we find a 1 followed by at least  + 1

zeros.

1.5.1 Exercises

Exercise 1.5.1 (Easy): What is the decimal representation of 1 guaranteed by Proposition 1.5.1? Make sure
to show that it does satisfy the condition.

Exercise 1.5.2: Prove the converse of Proposition 1.5.3, that is, if the digits in the decimal representation of 
are eventually repeating, then  must be rational.

Exercise 1.5.3: Show that real numbers   (0, 1) with nonunique decimal representation are exactly the
                                                
rational  numbers  that  can  be  written  as  10  for  some  integers    and  .  In  this  case  show  that  there  exist

exactly two representations of .

Exercise 1.5.4: Let   2 be an integer. Define a representation of a real number in [0, 1] in terms of base 
rather than base 10 and prove Proposition 1.5.1 for base .

Exercise 1.5.5: Using the previous exercise with  = 2 (binary), show that cardinality of  is the same as the
cardinality of P(), obtaining yet another (though related) proof that  is uncountable. Hint: Construct two
injections, one from [0, 1] to P() and one from P() to [0, 1]. Hint 2: Given a set   , let the th
binary digit of  be 1 if   .

Exercise 1.5.6 (Challenging): Explicitly construct an injection from [0, 1] × [0, 1] to [0, 1] (think about
why this is so surprising). Then describe the set of numbers in [0, 1] not in the image of your injection
(unless, of course, you managed to construct a bection). Hint: Consider even and odd digits of the decimal
expansion.

     With quite a bit more work (or by applying the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem) one can prove that
there is a bection. When he proved this result, Cantor apparently wrote "I see it but I don't believe it."

2.1 Sequences and limits

Note: 2.5 lectures

    Analysis is essentially about taking limits. The most basic type of a limit is a limit of a
sequence of real numbers. We have already seen sequences used informally. Let us give
the formal definition.

Definition 2.1.1. A sequence (of real numbers) is a function  :   . Instead of (), we
usually denote the th element in the sequence by . To denote a sequence we write

                                                              {   }=1 .

    A  sequence        {   }         is   bounded    if  the  underlying      function       is  bounded.            That  is,  if  there

                               =1
exists a    such that

                                                 ||   for all   .

In  other   words,     the     sequence      {   }        is  bounded     whenever     the   set   {     :           }   is   bounded.

                                                     =1
We similarly define the words bounded below and bounded above.

    When we need to give a concrete sequence, we often give each term as a formula in
                                     {1/}
terms  of   .    For  example,                   stands       for  the  sequence   1,  1/2,  1/3,  1/4,  1/5,  .  .  ..  The  sequence
{1/}                                         =1                                                                                 {}
            is  a  bounded           sequence    (     =  1   suffices).  On  the  other     hand,       the   sequence
        =1                                                                                                                            =1
stands for 1, 2, 3, 4, . . ., and this sequence is not bounded (why?).

    While the notation for a sequence is similar to that of a set, the notions are distinct. For

                                                   

example, the sequence (-1) =1 is the sequence -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, . . ., whereas the set of
values, the range of the sequence, is just the set {-1, 1}. We write this set as (-1) :    .

    Another example of a sequence is the so-called constant sequence. That is a sequence
{}
          =  ,   ,  ,  ,    .  .  .  consisting  of  a   single    constant            repeating       indefinitely.
      =1

    It is common to use {} or {} for brevity.                       { }=1,
    [BS]         (  )
            use             to    denote  a  sequence  instead  of           which  is  what     [R2]  uses.      Both   are  common.
                        =1

Definition  2.1.2.  A  sequence  {   }       is  said  to  converge  to  a  number             if  for  every

                                         =1
 > 0, there exists an    such that | - | <  for all   . The number  is called a
limit of the sequence. If the limit  is unique, we write

                                                   lim  .

                                                                     

    A sequence that converges is said to be convergent. Otherwise, we say the sequence
diverges or that it is divergent.

    Shortly, in Proposition 2.1.6 we will show that the limit  is always unique if it exists.
It makes sense to talk about the limit of a sequence and we only need to show that the
sequence converges to one number. For the next couple of examples, let us pretend we
have already proved that limits are unique.

    Intuitively, the limit being  means that eventually every number in the sequence is
close to the number . More precisely, we get arbitrarily close to the limit, provided we go
far enough in the sequence. It does not mean we ever reach the limit. It is possible, and
quite common, that there is no  in the sequence that equals the limit . We illustrate
the concept in Figure 2.1. In the figure we first think of the sequence as a graph, as it is a
function of . Secondly, we also plot it as a sequence of labeled points on the real line.

a graph with  and the interval around the limit  marked. On bottom, the points of the same

sequence are marked on the number line.

2.1. SEQUENCES AND LIMITS                                                                                  53

     When we write lim  =  for some real number , we are saying two things: First,
       {   }
that               is  convergent,  and  second,    that   the  limit  is  .
               =1
     The definition above is one of the most important definitions in analysis, and it is

necessary to understand it perfectly. The key point in the definition is that given any  > 0,

we can find an . The  can depend on , so we only pick an  once we know . Let us

illustrate convergence on a few examples.

Example 2.1.3: The constant sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, . . . converges to 1. For every  > 0, pick
 = 1. That is, | - | = |1 - 1| <  for all .

Example 2.1.4:         Claim:  The  sequence   {1/}        is  convergent  and

                                                       =1

                                                    lim 1 = 0.
                                                     

Proof: Given an  > 0, find an    such that 0 < 1/ <  (Archimedean property at
work). For all   ,

                                   | - | = 1 - 0 = 1 = 1  1 < .

Example 2.1.5: The sequence (-1) =1   is divergent. Proof: If there were a limit , then
       =  1                                                                               
for       2  we    expect  an      that  satisfies  the  definition.   Suppose  such  an    exists.  Then  for

an even   , we compute

                   1/2 > | - | = |1 - | and 1/2 > |+1 - | = |-1 - | .

And we obtain a contradiction
                      2 = |1 -  - (-1 - )|  |1 - | + |-1 - | < 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

Proposition 2.1.6. A convergent sequence has a unique limit.

    The proof of this proposition exhibits a useful technique in analysis. Many proofs
follow the same general scheme. We want to show a certain quantity is zero. We write
the quantity using the triangle inequality as two quantities, and we estimate each one by
arbitrarily small numbers.

Proof.  Suppose        {   }       has limits    and  .    Take an arbitrary      >  0.  From the definition

                               =1
find an 1 such that for all   1, | - | < /2. Similarly, find an 2 such that for all
  2, we have  -  < /2. Now take an  such that   1 and also   2, and

estimate

                                         -          =  -  - ( - )

                                                     | - | +  - 
                                                    <  +  = .

                                                       22

As  -  <  for all  > 0, then  -  = 0 and  = . Hence the limit (if it exists) is

unique.

Proposition  2.1.7.  A    convergent  sequence     {   }       is  bounded.

                                                           =1

Proof.  Suppose  {   }      converges    to  .  Thus there exists an                 such that for all     ,

                       =1
we have | - | < 1. For   ,

                                         || = | -  + |
                                               | - | + ||
                                              < 1 + || .

The set |1| , |2| , . . . , |-1| , 1 + || is a finite set and hence let

                             max |1| , |2| , . . . , |-1| , 1 + || .

Then for all   ,

                                                   ||  .                                                   

    The sequence (-1) =1   shows that the converse does not hold. A bounded sequence
is not necessarily convergent.

                                                                1  1 < .

Therefore,   lim     2+1    =  1.  This  example      shows        that  sometimes   to  get  what  you  want,
                     2+
you must throw away some information to get a simpler estimate.

2.1.1 Monotone sequences

The simplest type of a sequence is a monotone sequence. Checking that a monotone
sequence converges is as easy as checking that it is bounded. It is also easy to find the limit
for a convergent monotone sequence, provided we can find the supremum or infimum of a
countable set of numbers.

Definition      2.1.9.      A   sequence    {   }       is  monotone  increasing     if          +1      for  all         .  A
                {   }
sequence                    is  monotone            =1      if      +1   for    all        .   If  a  sequence        is  either
                        =1                  decreasing

monotone increasing or monotone decreasing, we can simply say the sequence is monotone.

    For   example,          {}        is    monotone    increasing,   {1/}           is  monotone        decreasing,      the

                                  =1                                          =1
constant     sequence       {1}         is  both  monotone        increasing    and      monotone     decreasing,         and
        
                                  =1
(-1) =1 is not monotone. First few terms of a sample monotone increasing sequence
are shown in Figure 2.2.

Theorem         2.1.10  (Monotone         convergence   theorem).     A  monotone        sequence     {   }       is  bounded

if and only if it is convergent.                                                                              =1

    Furthermore,        if  {   }       is  monotone  increasing    and  bounded,    then

                                    =1

                                            lim  = sup{ :   }.

                                            

If  {   }       is  monotone    decreasing  and   bounded,      then

            =1

                                            lim  = inf{ :   }.

                                            

Proof.  Consider        a   monotone        increasing      sequence  {     } .      Suppose first the sequence is

bounded, that is, the set { :   } is bounded. Let                             =1

                                                   sup{ :   }.

Let  > 0 be arbitrary. As  is the supremum, there must be at least one    such that
                        {   }
    >     -     .   As              is  monotone      increasing,     then  it  is  easy   to  see  (by  induction)       that
                                =1
   for all   . Hence for all   ,

                                      | - | =  -    -  < .

    Some authors use the word monotonic.
56                                                             CHAPTER 2. SEQUENCES AND SERIES

So  {   }       converges    to  .  Therefore,    a  bounded       monotone    increasing  sequence           converges.

            =1
For the other direction, we already proved that a convergent sequence is bounded.

    The proof for monotone decreasing sequences is left as an exercise.                                                     

    A  monotone       increasing      sequence    {   }        is  always  bounded    from     below          since  1      

                                                          =1
2  · · ·   for any , so 1 is a lower bound. So to see if a monotone increasing sequence

is bounded, it is enough to check if it is bounded above. Similarly, a monotone decreasing

sequence is always bounded from above, so it is enough to check whether it is bounded

from below.

Example 2.1.11: Take the sequence                 1         .
                                                     =1

    The sequence is bounded below as              1    >    0 for all      .   Let us show that it is monotone
                                                    

decreasing. We start with  + 1   (why is that true?). From this inequality we obtain

                                                       1        .  1

                                                       +1 

So the sequence is monotone decreasing and bounded below (hence bounded). Via
Theorem 2.1.10 we find that the sequence is convergent and

                                         lim  = inf  :    .1   1

                                                               

We already know that the infimum is greater than or equal to 0, as 0 is a lower bound. Take

a  number          0  such   that        1   for  all  .  We   square    both  sides  to  obtain
                                           

                                         2  1 for all   .

We have seen before that this implies that 2  0 (a consequence of the Archimedean
property). As 2  0 as well, we have 2 = 0 and so  = 0. Hence,  = 0 is the greatest
lower bound, and lim 1 = 0.

                                  

Example 2.1.12: A word of caution: Showing that a monotone sequence is bounded in
                                                                                                              1/}
order to use Theorem 2.1.10 may be difficult.                     The  sequence  {1   +   1/2  +  ·  ·  ·  +            is  a
                                                                                                                    =1
monotone increasing sequence that grows slowly and in fact grows slower and slower as 

gets larger. We will see, once we get to series, that this sequence has no upper bound and

so does not converge. It is not at all obvious that this sequence has no upper bound.

    A common example of where monotone sequences arise is the following proposition.
The proof is left as an exercise.

Proposition 2.1.13. Let    be a nonempty bounded set. Then there exist monotone sequences
{   }            {  }
            and              such  that  ,             and
        =1               =1

                             sup  = lim  and inf  = lim .

2.1.2 Tail of a sequence

Definition 2.1.14. For a sequence {}=1, the -tail (where   ), or just the tail, of
{   }       is  the  sequence    starting        at     +  1,   usually  written     as

        =1

                                                                or          {   }=+1 .

                                          {  + }=1

For   example,        the   4-tail      of  {1/}           is  1/5, 1/6, 1/7, 1/8, . . ..  The  0-tail  of  a  sequence    is  the

                                                    =1
sequence itself. The convergence and the limit of a sequence only depends on its tail.

Proposition       2.1.15.   Let  {   }           be  a  sequence.   Then    the  following      statements     are  equivalent:

                                         =1

(i)   The   sequence        {   }       converges.

                                    =1

(ii) The -tail {+}=1 converges for all   .

(iii) The -tail {+}=1 converges for some   .

Furthermore, if any (and hence all) of the limits exist, then for all   

                                                     lim  = lim +.
                                                                   

Proof. It is clear that (ii) implies (iii). We will therefore show first that (i) implies (ii), and
then we will show that (iii) implies (i). That is,

                                                 to prove (ii)
                                                 (i) to prove (iii)

In the process we will also show that the limits are equal.
                                                                {   }
We    start     with  (i)   implies       (ii).  Suppose                    converges      to   some           .    Let          be
                                                                        =1        {  }
arbitrary, and define                   + .      We     wish    to  show    that                converges      to   .    Given   an
                                                                                          =1
 > 0, there exists an    such that | - | <  for all   . Note that    implies
 +   . Therefore, for all   , we have

                                                  -  = | - +| < .

Consequently,        {  }        converges       to     .

                             =1
Let us move to (iii) implies (i). Let    be given, define  +, and suppose
      {  }                                                                                                        
that              converges      to         .    That      is,  given  an     >  0,  there      exists  an               such  that
              =1
 -  <  for all   . Let   + . Then    implies  -   . Thus,
whenever   , we have

                                                 | - | =  - - < .

Therefore,      {   }       converges       to   .                                                                               

                        =1

    At the end of the day, the limit does not care about how the sequence begins, it only
cares about the tail of the sequence. The beginning of the sequence may be arbitrary.

       For example, the sequence defined by                                                       is  decreasing       if  we     start     at        =  4   (it  is
                                                   {   }                                 2+16
increasing          before).         That     is:                 =     1/17,     1/10,  3/25,  1/8,  5/41,  3/26,  7/65,  1/10,  9/97,     5/58,  .  .  .,  and
                                                           =1

                        1/17 < 1/10 < 3/25 < 1/8 > 5/41 > 3/26 > 7/65 > 1/10 > 9/97 > 5/58 > . . . .

If we throw away the first 3 terms and look at the 3-tail, it is decreasing. The proof is left as
an exercise. Since the 3-tail is monotone and bounded below by zero, it is convergent, and
therefore the sequence is convergent.

2.1.3 Subsequences

It  is  useful      to  sometimes            consider       only        some      terms      of  a  sequence.       A  subsequence                of  {   }
                                                                                                             {   }
        sequence           that      contains                           of    the    numbers        from                       the      same                  =1
is  a                                              only     some                                                     =1    in                      order.

Definition          2.1.16.          Let  {   }         be     a  sequence.          Let     {   }      be   a  strictly    increasing             sequence

                                                  =1                                                =1
of natural numbers, that is,  < +1 for all    (in other words 1 < 2 < 3 < · · · ). The

sequence                                                                               

                                                                              { }=1

is  called       a  subsequence           of  {    } .

                                                     =1

       So    the    subsequence              is   the   sequence              1 , 2 , 3 , . . ..        Consider           the  sequence              {1/} .
                           {1/3}
The                                       =   1,  1/3,  1/6,   1/9,  .  .  .  is                                                                              =1

                                             {1/} .
not     a  subsequence               of                        Similarly, order must be preserved.                                So the sequence

1,  1/3,   1/2,  1/5,   .  .  .  is  not  a  subsequence             of

       A tail of a sequence is one special type of a subsequence. For an arbitrary subsequence,

we have the following proposition about convergence.

Proposition             2.1.17.      If   {   }         is  a  convergent            sequence,      then  every     subsequence         {         }          is  also
                                                                                                                                                     =1
convergent, and                                   =1

                                                                  lim  = lim  .
                                                                                     

Proof. Suppose lim  = . So for every  > 0, there is an    such that for all
  ,

                                                   | - | < .

It is not hard to prove (do it!) by induction that    for all   . Hence    implies
  . Thus, for all   ,

                                                    -  < ,

and we are done.                                                                                                                                                  

Example 2.1.18: Existence of a convergent subsequence does not imply convergence of

the sequence itself. Take the sequence 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, . . .. That is,  = 0 if  is odd, and
                                                               {   }                                                                                  { 2 }=1
    =     1  if     is  even.        The     sequence                         is     divergent;       however,      the    subsequence
                                                                       =1
converges to 1 and the subsequence {2+1}=1 converges to 0. Compare Proposition 2.3.7.

2.2 Facts about limits of sequences

Note: 2-2.5 lectures, recursively defined sequences can safely be skipped

    In this section we go over some basic results about the limits of sequences. We start by
looking at how sequences interact with inequalities.

2.2.1 Limits and inequalities

A basic lemma about limits and inequalities is the so-called squeeze lemma. It allows us to
show convergence of sequences in difficult cases if we find two other simpler convergent
sequences that "squeeze" the original sequence.

Lemma    2.2.1    (Squeeze   lemma).    Let  {   }=1 ,  {  }=1 ,  and  {   }       be  sequences  such  that

                                                                               =1

                                           for all   .

Suppose  {   }       and  {  }        converge  and

                 =1               =1

                                             lim  = lim .
                                                          

Then  {   }       converges  and

              =1

                                      lim  = lim  = lim .
                                                            

Proof. Let  lim  = lim . Let  > 0 be given. Find an 1 such that for all
  1, we have that | - | < , and an 2 such that for all   2, we have | - | < .
Set  max{1, 2}. Suppose   . In particular,  -  < , or  -  < . Similarly,
 <  + . Putting everything together, we find

                                       -  <      <  + .

In other words, - <  -  <  or | - | < .                           So     {   }         converges  to    .  See

Figure 2.3.                                                                      =1                           

                                                                       

                     -                                                                 +

Example 2.2.2: One application of the squeeze lemma is to compute limits of sequences
using limits that we already know. For example, consider the sequence 1   =1. Since


    1 for all   , we have
                                                          11

                                                  0  
                                                        

for  all        .     We  already       know   lim         1/  =  0.   Hence,  using   the  constant  sequence  {0}
                              {1/}
and  the      sequence                    in  the   squeeze    lemma,  we    conclude                                 =1
                                      =1

                                                                   1
                                                           lim  = 0.
                                                             

     Limits, when they exist, preserve non-strict inequalities.

Lemma         2.2.3.  Let     {   }       and  {  }        be  convergent  sequences   and

                                      =1               =1

                                                       for all   .

Then

                                                        lim   lim .
                                                                  

Proof. Let  lim  and  lim . Let  > 0 be given. Find an 1 such
that for all   1, we have | - | < /2. Find an 2 such that for all   2, we
have  -  < /2. In particular, for some   max{1, 2}, we have  -  < /2 and
 -  < /2. We add these inequalities to obtain

                               -  +  -  < , or  -  <  -  + .

Since   , we have 0   -  and hence 0 <  -  + . In other words,

                                                            -  < .

Because  > 0 was arbitrary, we obtain  -   0. Therefore,   .                                                    

    The next corollary follows by using constant sequences in Lemma 2.2.3. The proof is
left as an exercise.

Corollary 2.2.4.

    (i)   If  {   }       is  a  convergent    sequence    such  that        0 for all       , then

                      =1

                                                               lim   0.

                                                               

(ii)      Let ,               and  let  {   }       be  a  convergent  sequence  such  that

                                                =1

                                                             for all   .

          Then

                                                             lim   .

                                                                  

    In Lemma 2.2.3 and Corollary 2.2.4 we cannot simply replace all the non-strict inequali-
ties with strict inequalities. For example, let  -1/ and  1/. Then  < ,  < 0,
2.2. FACTS ABOUT LIMITS OF SEQUENCES                                                                      63

and  > 0 for all . However, these inequalities are not preserved by the limit operation

as lim  = lim  = 0. The moral of this example is that strict inequalities may

become non-strict inequalities when limits are applied; if we know  <  for all , we

may only conclude

                                             lim   lim .
                                                             

This issue is a common source of errors.

2.2.2 Continuity of algebraic operations

Limits interact nicely with algebraic operations.

Proposition  2.2.5.    Let  {   }       and  {  }        be  convergent  sequences.

                                    =1               =1

(i) The sequence {}=1, where   + , converges and

                               lim ( + ) = lim  = lim  + lim .
                                                                              

(ii) The sequence {}=1, where   - , converges and

                               lim ( - ) = lim  = lim  - lim .
                                                                              

(iii) The sequence {}=1, where   , converges and

                               lim ( ) = lim  = lim  lim  .
                                                                              

(iv) If lim   0 and   0 for all   , then the sequence {}=1, where                                           ,

                                                                                                          

        converges and                   lim  = lim  = lim  .

                                                               lim 

Proof.  We  start  with  (i).  Suppose  {   }       and      {  }        are  convergent  sequences  and  write

                                                =1                   =1
  + . Let  lim ,  lim , and   + .

    Let  > 0 be given. Find an 1 such that for all   1, we have | - | < /2. Find
an 2 such that for all   2, we have  -  < /2. Take  max{1, 2}. For all
  , we have

                               | - | = ( + ) - ( + )

                                         =  -  +  - 

                                          | - | +  - 
                                         <  +  = .

                                            22

Therefore (i) is proved. Proof of (ii) is almost identical and is left as an exercise.
64                                                                  CHAPTER 2. SEQUENCES AND SERIES

    Let  us  tackle    (iii).  Suppose           again  that  {   }       and  {  }        are  convergent      sequences

                                                                      =1               =1
and write   . Let  lim ,  lim , and   .

    Let  > 0 be given. Let  max{|| ,  , /3, 1}. Find an 1 such that for all   1,
                 -        .                                                                           -              .
we  have    |       |  <          Find       an  2  such  that  for  all         2,    we    have               <           Take
                          3                                                                                          3
 max{1, 2}. For all   , we have

         | - | = ( ) - ()

                    = ( -  + )( -  + ) -  

                    = ( - ) + ( - ) + ( - )( - )

                     ( - ) + ( - ) + ( - )( - )

                    = | - |  + ||  -  + | - |  - 

                    < 3  +  3 +   3 3                               (now  notice  that             1  and            1)
                      +  +  = .                                                              3

                       333

    Finally, we examine (iv). Instead of proving (iv) directly, we prove the following simpler

claim:

    Claim:   If   {  }        is  a  convergent  sequence     such  that  lim                0  and          0  for  all      ,
      {1/ }
                          =1
then            =1  converges     and

                                                 lim 1 = 1 .
                                                   lim 

    Once    the   claim   is   proved,       we  take   the   sequence    {1/    } ,   multiply      it  by  the     sequence
{   }
            and   apply   item       (iii).                                        =1
        =1

    Proof of claim: Let  > 0 be given. Let                                                                  2  ||
                                                              lim . As   0, then min  2 , 2 >

0. Find an  such that for all   , we have

                                              -  < min  2  ,  .
                                                                       22

For all   , we have  -  < ||/2, and so
                             =  -  +    -  +  <  +  .
                                                                              2

Subtracting ||/2 from both sides we obtain ||/2 <  , or in other words,
                                                      1 < 2.
                                                      
2.2. FACTS ABOUT LIMITS OF SEQUENCES                                                                          65

We finish the proof of the claim:

                                           1 - 1 =  -   
                                                     =  - 
                                                           
                                                       -  2
                                                             

                                                                  2

                                                          22
                                                     <   = .

And we are done.                                                                                                

By      plugging  in  constant  sequences,    we  get     several   easy  corollaries.  If           and  {   }

is a convergent sequence, then for example                                                                        =1

                  lim  =  lim                 and lim ( + ) =  + lim .
                                                                                    

Similarly, we find such equalities for constant subtraction and division.                                 

As      we   can  take  limits  past   multiplication     we      can  show  (exercise)     that   lim          =
(lim ) for all   . That is, we can take limits past powers. Let us see if we can do

the same with roots.

Proposition  2.2.6.   Let  {   }       be  a  convergent  sequence  such  that      0   for   all      .  Then

                                   =1         lim  = lim .

                                                          

    Of course, to even make this statement, we need to apply Corollary 2.2.4 to show that
lim   0, so that we can take the square root without worry.

Proof.  Let  {  }     be  a  convergent       sequence  and  let       lim . As we just mentioned,

  0.              =1

    First suppose  = 0. Let  > 0 be given. Then there is an  such that for all   , we
                                                   

have  = || < 2, or in other words,  < . Hence,
                                              -  =  < .

    Now suppose  > 0 (and hence  > 0).

                                 -                   - 
                                              = 

                                                     + 
                                              =  1   |  +   - |

                                                  1
                                                | - | .

                                                   

We leave the rest of the proof to the reader.                                                                   
66                                                       CHAPTER 2. SEQUENCES AND SERIES

                                                                                                                                                       1/

    A similar proof works for the th root. That is, we also obtain lim  =
(lim )1/. We leave this to the reader as a challenging exercise.

    We may also want to take the limit past the absolute value sign. The converse of this

proposition is not true, see Exercise 2.1.7 part b).

Proposition  2.2.7.  If  {   }       is  a  convergent  sequence,  then  {|  |}=1  is  convergent  and

                                 =1

                                            lim || = lim  .
                                                         

Proof. We simply note the reverse triangle inequality

                                            || - ||  | - | .

Hence if | - | can be made arbitrarily small, so can || - || . Details are left to the

reader.                                                                                                 

    Let us see an example putting the propositions above together. Since lim 1/ = 0,
then

         lim 1 + 1/ - 100/2 =               1 + lim 1/ - 100 lim 1/ lim 1/ = 1.
                                                                                   
         

That is, the limit on the left-hand side exists because the right-hand side exists. You really
should read the equality above from right to left.

    On the other hand you must apply the propositions carefully. For example, by rewriting
the expression with common denominator first we find

                                            lim 2 -  = -1.
                                              + 1

             2                                                           2
However, +1 =1 and {}=1 are not convergent, so lim +1 - lim  is nonsense.
                                                                                   

2.2.3 Recursively defined sequences

Now that we know we can interchange limits and algebraic operations, we can compute
the limits of many sequences. One such class are recursively defined sequences, that is,
sequences where the next number in the sequence is computed using a formula from a
fixed number of preceding elements in the sequence.

Example 2.2.8:  Let  {   }       be      defined  by  1  2 and

                             =1

                                            +1  - 2 - 2 2 .

We must first find out if this sequence is well-defined; we must show we never divide by
zero. Then we must find out if the sequence converges. Only then can we attempt to find
the limit.
2.2. FACTS ABOUT LIMITS OF SEQUENCES                                                                                                    67

    So let us prove that for all   exists and  > 0 (so the sequence is well-defined
and bounded below). Let us show this by induction. We know that 1 = 2 > 0. For the
induction step, suppose  exists and  > 0. Then

                                    +1 =  - 2 - 2 2 = 22 - 2 + 2 2 = 2 + 2 2 .

                                    2                                                         2 +2
It is always true that  + 2 > 0, and as  > 0, then +1 = 2 > 0.
                                                                                                                            2     -     
     Next    let  us  show       that  the     sequence    is  monotone        decreasing.          If  we     show  that            2    0
                                                                                                                              
          ,           +1                         .                 2     -     =       -      =                                      ,
for  all     then                      for  all      Obviously              2     4       2      2  >   0.  For  an  arbitrary          we
                                                                     1
have

                              + 22          2        4     +  42   +  4  -  82            4   -  42     +   4     - 22      2

            2     -                            -2=                                          
                      2  =                                          2 = 2=                                                     .
          +1                     2                               4                               4                   42

Since     squares     are    nonnegative,            2     -  2    0 for all .            Therefore,        {   }       is  monotone

                                                       +1                                                           =1
decreasing and bounded ( > 0 for all ), and so the limit exists. It remains to find the

limit.

     Write

                                                     2 +1          =    2   +  2.

                                                                      

Since {+1}=1 is the 1-tail of {}=1, it converges to the same limit. Let us define
 lim . Take the limit of both sides to obtain

                                                  22 = 2 + 2,
                                                                                 

or 2 = 2. As  > 0 for all  we get   0, and therefore  = 2.

     You may have seen the sequence above before. It is Newton's method for finding the

square root of 2. This method comes up often in practice and converges very rapidly. We

used    the  fact  that     2    -  2  >  0,   although    it    was  not   strictly      needed        to  show  convergence           by

                              1
considering a tail of the sequence. The sequence converges as long as 1  0, although
with a negative 1 we would arrive at  = - 2. By replacing the 2 in the numerator we

obtain the square root of any positive number. These statements are left as an exercise.

     You should, however, be careful. Before taking any limits, you must make sure the

sequence converges. Let us see an example.

Example 2.2.9: Suppose 1                         1 and +1          2     +  .      If  we     blindly       assumed     that   the   limit

                                                                     
exists (call it ), then we would get the equation  = 2 + , from which we might conclude
                                                                  {   }
  =  0.   However,       it  is  not   hard      to  show  that                is  unbounded            and      therefore    does      not
                                                                          =1
converge.

     The thing to notice in this example is that the method still works, but it depends on

the initial value 1. If we set 1 0, then the sequence converges and the limit really is 0.

An entire branch of mathematics, called dynamics, deals precisely with these issues. See

Exercise 2.2.14.

2.2.4 Some convergence tests

It is not always necessary to go back to the definition of convergence to prove that a

sequence is convergent. We first give a simple convergence test. The main idea is that
{   }                                                            |}
            converges        to    if  and   only    if  {|   -           converges   to  zero.
        =1                                                            =1

Proposition 2.2.10.          Let   {   }         be  a   sequence.  Suppose there is an             and a convergent
            {   }
                                           =1
sequence            =1    such   that

                                                            lim  = 0
                                                            

and
                                     | - |   for all   .

Then  {     }        converges and       lim         =   .
                                         
              =1

Proof. Let  > 0 be given. Note that   0 for all . Find an    such that for all   ,
we have  = | - 0| < . Then, for all   , we have

                                                     | - |   < .                                                         

    As the proposition shows, to study when a sequence has a limit is the same as studying
when another sequence goes to zero. In general, it may be hard to decide if a sequence
converges, but for certain sequences there exist easy to apply tests that tell us if the sequence
converges or not. Let us see one such test. First, let us compute the limit of a certain specific
sequence.

Proposition 2.2.11. Let  > 0.

    (i) If  < 1, then                                         lim  = 0.

                                                              

(ii)  If    >   1,   then    {   }       is  unbounded.

                                     =1

Proof. First consider  < 1. As  > 0, then  > 0 for all    by induction. As  < 1, then
  +1                             {   }
      <         for  all  .  So              is  a   decreasing  sequence       that  is  bounded    below.  Hence,  it  is
                                         =1  .                   {   +1 }
convergent. Let                  lim             The     1-tail                 also  converges  to  .  Taking  the  limit
                                                                            =1
of both sides of +1 =  · , we obtain  = , or (1 - ) = 0. It follows that  = 0 as   1.
                                                                                          (1/)       
    Now consider  > 1. Let  > 0 be arbitrary. As 1/ < 1, then
                                                                                                     =1 converges to 0.
Hence for some large enough , we get

                                                         1 = 1  < 1.
                                                                          

In other words,              >   ,     and       is  not  an  upper  bound      for   {} .        As  was arbitrary,
{   }
            is  unbounded.                                                                    =1                         
        =1

    In the proposition above, the ratio of the ( + 1)th term and the th term is . We
generalize this simple result to a larger class of sequences. The following lemma will come
up again once we get to series.
2.2. FACTS ABOUT LIMITS OF SEQUENCES                                                                                    69

Lemma     2.2.12  (Ratio    test  for   sequences).       Let  {   }       be  a  sequence  such  that          0  for  all  

and such that the limit                                                =1

                                           lim |+1| exists.
                                                     ||

(i)   If   <  1,  then  {   }       converges       and   lim    = 0.
                                                         
                                =1

(ii)  If   >  1,  then  {   }       is  unbounded        (hence  diverges).

                                =1

    If  exists, but  = 1, the lemma says nothing. We cannot make any conclusion based
                                                                           {1/}
on  that  information   alone.      For   example,    the  sequence                    converges  to    zero,   but     =    1.
                                                                                   =1                                
The constant sequence {1}=1 converges to 1, not zero, and  = 1. The sequence (-1) =1

does  not  converge     at  all,  and     =  1  as  well.  Finally,  the   sequence    {}         is  unbounded,        yet

                                                                                             =1
again  = 1. The statement of the lemma may be strengthened somewhat, see exercises

2.2.13 and 2.3.15.

Proof. Suppose  < 1. As ||+|1|  0 for all , then   0. Pick  such that  <  < 1. We
wish  to  compare   the     sequence      {   }       to  the  sequence    {} .        The  idea      is  that  while   the

                                                  =1                               =1
ratio ||+|1| is not going to be less than  eventually, it will eventually be less than , which
is still less than 1. The intuitive idea of the proof is illustrated in Figure 2.4.

                                                                                  1

Figure 2.4: The short lines represent the ratios ||+|1| approaching  < 1.

    As  -  > 0, there exists an    such that for all   , we have

                                                |+1| || -  <  - .

Therefore, for   ,

                                  |+1| || -  <  -  or |+1| || < .

For  >  (that is for    + 1) write

      || = || |+1| |+2| || |+ · · · || < | 1| |-1| |  · · ·  = || - = (|| -) .

The   sequence    {   }       converges         to  zero   and   hence     || -             converges     to    zero.   By
                                             }                                                            }
Proposition               =1  -tail     {                                                         {
              2.2.10,   the                    =+1       converges   to    zero   and  therefore            =1  converges

to zero.

    Now suppose  > 1. Pick  such that 1 <  < . As  -  > 0, there exists an   

such that for all                            |+1| || -  <  - .

Therefore,                                           |+1| || > .

The  sequence   {   }         is  unbounded      (since     >    1),  and  so  {   }       cannot  be  bounded  (if

||                      =1                                       ,                     =1

{   }       cannot   converge.

Example 2.2.13: A simple application of the lemma above is to prove

                                                     lim 2 = 0.
                                                      !

    Proof: Compute                2 2+1/( + 1)! /! = 2 2+1 ! ( + 1)! = 2  + 1 .
It is not hard to see that
                                   2

                                  +1 =1 converges to zero. The conclusion follows by the lemma.

Example 2.2.14: A more complicated (and useful) application of the ratio test is to prove

                                                  lim 1/ = 1.                  
                                                                      (1+)
                                                                               =1. Compute

    Proof: Let  > 0 be given. Consider the sequence

                                         ( + 1)/(1 + )+1 =  + 1 1 .
                                           /(1 + )                     1+

The  limit  of  +1   =  1  +  1   as         is  1,  and  so
                              

                                           ( + 1)/(1 + )+1 1
                                      lim                 =                    < 1.
                                       /(1 + )                        1+

                         

Therefore, (1+) =1 converges to 0. In particular, there exists an  such that for   ,
we have   < 1, or  < (1 + ), or 1/ < 1 + . As   1, then 1/  1, and so

                 (1+)

0  1/ - 1 < . Consequently, lim 1/ = 1.

2.3 Limit superior, limit inferior, and Bolzano-Weierstrass

Note: 1-2 lectures, alternative proof of BW optional

    In this section we study bounded sequences and their subsequences. In particular,
we define the so-called limit superior and limit inferior of a bounded sequence and talk
about limits of subsequences. Furthermore, we prove the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem,
an indispensable tool in analysis, showing the existence of convergent subsequences.

    We proved that every convergent sequence is bounded; nevertheless, there exist many

                                                                                                                        

bounded divergent sequences. For instance, the sequence (-1) =1 is bounded, but
divergent. All is not lost, however, and we can still compute certain limits with a bounded
divergent sequence.

2.3.1 Upper and lower limits

There are ways of creating monotone sequences out of any sequence, and in this fashion

we get the so-called limit superior and limit inferior. These limits always exist for bounded

sequences.        {   }

If   a  sequence          =1  is    bounded,     then    the  set  {  :      }    is  bounded.    For  every       ,  the

set { :   } is also bounded (as it is a subset), so we take its supremum and infimum.

Definition      2.3.1.  Let  {   }       be  a  bounded  sequence.       Define   the     sequences    {   }       and
{  }
                                     =1                                                                        =1
        =1  by          sup{ :   } and                   inf{ :   }. Define, if the limits exist,

                             lim sup            lim  ,        lim inf        lim .

                                                                             

    For a bounded sequence, liminf and limsup always exist (see below). It is possible to
define liminf and limsup for unbounded sequences if we allow  and -, and we do so

later in this section. It is not hard to generalize the following results to include unbounded

sequences; however, we first restrict our attention to bounded ones.

Proposition     2.3.2.  Let  {   }       be  a  bounded  sequence.  Let      and      be  as  in  the  definition  above.

                                     =1

(i)     The  sequence   {   }       is  bounded  monotone     decreasing     and  {  }        is bounded monotone

                                =1                                                        =1
        increasing. In particular, lim inf  and lim sup  exist.
                                                         

(ii) lim sup  = inf{ :   } and lim inf  = sup{ :   }.
                                                 

(iii) lim inf   lim sup .
                        

Proof.  Let  us   see   why  {   }       is a decreasing sequence.           As       is the least upper bound

                                     =1
for { :   }, it is also an upper bound for the subset { :    + 1}. Therefore +1,
the least upper bound for { :    + 1}, has to be less than or equal to , the least

Example 2.3.3:       Let  {   }       be    defined    by

                                  =1

                                              +1 if  is odd,
                                                     0 if  is even.

Let us compute the lim inf and lim sup of this sequence. See also Figure 2.6. First the limit

inferior:

                             lim inf  = lim inf{ :   } = lim 0 = 0.
                                                                                

For the limit superior, we write

                                    lim sup  = lim sup{ :   } .

It is not hard to see that

                                                            +1       if  is odd,

We leave it to the reader to show that the limit is 1. That is,

                                                    lim sup  = 1.

                                                      

Do  note  that    the  sequence     {   }       is  not  a  convergent   sequence.

    We associate certain subsequences with lim sup and lim inf. It is important to notice
      {   }            {  }                                     {   }=1 ,

of  the  same     numbers.    For   example,    if  the  sequence    is              then     =  0  for  all         .

Theorem     2.3.4.  If  {   }       is  a  bounded  sequence,  then  there  exists   a  subsequence  {        }      such
                                                                                                                 =1

                                                lim  = lim sup  .
                                                            

Similarly,  there  exists  a  (perhaps     different)  subsequence  {    }     such     that

                                                                           =1

                                                lim  = lim inf  .
                                                            

Proof. Define  sup{ :   }. Write  lim sup  = lim . We define
the subsequence inductively. Let 1 1, and suppose 1, 2, . . . , -1 are already defined
for some   2. Pick an   -1 + 1 such that

                                                (-1+1) -  < 1 .
76                                                                  CHAPTER 2. SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Such an  exists as (-1+1) is a supremum of the set { :   -1 + 1} and hence there are

elements of the sequence arbitrarily close (or even possibly equal) to the supremum. Set
                                                
    .    The  subsequence           {        }  =1  is  defined.    Next,  we  must  prove   that  it  converges          to  .

    For all   2, we have (-1+1)   (why?) and    . Therefore, for every   2,

                                                 -      =  - 
                                                         (-1+1) - 
                                                        < 1 .

    Let  us  show  that    {        }        converges  to  .       Note that the subsequence need not be
                                       =1               {   }                                                             }
monotone.     Let  > 0 be given.                   As               converges    to  ,  the  subsequence         {  
                                                                =1                                                          =1
converges to . Thus there exists an 1   such that for all   1, we have

                                                         -  < 2 .

    We leave the statement for lim inf as an exercise.                                                                        

2.3.2 Using limit inferior and limit superior

The advantage of lim inf and lim sup is that we can always write them down for any
(bounded) sequence. If we could somehow compute them, we could also compute the
limit of the sequence if it exists, or show that the sequence diverges. Working with lim inf
and lim sup is a little bit like working with limits, although there are subtle differences.

Proposition   2.3.5.  Let     {   }        be   a  bounded  sequence.      Then  {   }       converges  if  and  only     if

                                      =1                                                 =1

                                                lim inf  = lim sup .
                                                                    

Furthermore,  if  {   }       converges,        then

                          =1

                                       lim  = lim inf  = lim sup .
                                                                       
2.3. LIMIT SUPERIOR, LIMIT INFERIOR, AND BOLZANO-WEIERSTRASS                                                                     77

Proof. Let  and  be as in Definition 2.3.1. In particular, for all   ,

                                                           .

First    suppose  lim inf                  =  lim sup          .      Then    {   }       and    {  }          both   converge   to

                                                                                      =1                 =1
the    same    limit.  By  the     squeeze    lemma       (Lemma      2.2.1),  {   }         converges         and

                                                                                       =1

                                              lim  = lim  = lim .
                                                                             

       Now     suppose    {   }        converges       to   .  By     Theorem      2.3.4,    there      exists  a   subsequence
         }                                                      {   }
{                                 =1                   .                                             ,
           =1  converging       to  lim sup                 As          =1    converges          to     every       subsequence
       

converges to  and so lim sup  = lim  = . Similarly, lim inf  = . 

       Limit superior and limit inferior behave nicely with subsequences.

Proposition    2.3.6.      Suppose     {   }       is  a  bounded     sequence     and  {        }      is  a  subsequence.    Then
                                                                                                    =1
                                               =1

                            lim inf   lim inf   lim sup   lim sup .
                                                                                          

Proof. The middle inequality has been proved already. We will prove the third inequality,

and leave the first inequality as an exercise.

     We want to prove that lim sup   lim sup . Define  sup{ :   }
as usual. Also define                      sup{        :       }.     It  is  not  true    that     {   }       is necessarily a

                                                                                                            =1
subsequence of {}=1. However, as    for all , we have { :   }  { :   }.
A supremum of a subset is less than or equal to the supremum of the set, and therefore

                                                      for all .

Lemma 2.2.3 gives

                                                      lim   lim  ,
                                                                   

which is the desired conclusion.                                                                                                     

       Limit superior and limit inferior are the largest and smallest subsequential limits. If
                                   
the    subsequence     {        }  =1  in  the  previous    proposition       is   convergent,          then   lim inf               =

lim  = lim sup  . Therefore,

                                         lim inf   lim   lim sup .
                                                                              

    Similarly, we get the following useful test for convergence of a bounded sequence. We
leave the proof as an exercise.

Proposition    2.3.7.      A    bounded       sequence    {   }       is  convergent      and    converges      to    if  and  only  if
                                                }
                                           {                      =1      .
every    convergent    subsequence                =1   converges    to

2.3.3 Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem

While it is not true that a bounded sequence is convergent, the Bolzano-Weierstrass

theorem tells us that we can at least find a convergent subsequence. The version of

Bolzano-Weierstrass we present in this section is the Bolzano-Weierstrass for sequences of

real numbers.

Theorem   2.3.8    (Bolzano-Weierstrass).            Suppose    a  sequence  {   }       of  real  numbers           is  bounded.
                                                           } .
Then   there  exists  a  convergent  subsequence       {                             =1
                                                             =1

Proof. Theorem 2.3.4 says that there exists a subsequence whose limit is lim sup . 

    The reader might complain right now that Theorem 2.3.4 is strictly stronger than the
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem as presented above. That is true. However, Theorem 2.3.4
only applies to the real line, but Bolzano-Weierstrass applies in more general contexts (that
is, in ) with pretty much the exact same statement.

    As the theorem is so important to analysis, we present an explicit proof. The idea of the
following proof also generalizes to different contexts.

Alternate proof of Bolzano-Weierstrass. As the sequence is bounded, there exist two numbers
                                                                                                                 }
1   <  1  such   that    1         1   for    all       .  We      will  define  a  subsequence         {                and  two
                   }             } ,                      }                                             }          =1
sequences     {          and  {        such   that   {          is  monotone     increasing,   {                 is  monotone

decreasing,                        and such that lim                     =  lim .        That      {         }       converges
                                                                                                           
                                                                                                               =1
then follows by the squeeze lemma.

    We define the sequences inductively. We will define the sequences so that for all , we

have  < , and that   [ , ] for infinitely many   . We have already defined 1
and 1. We take 1 1, that is 1 = 1. Suppose that up to some   , we have defined
the subsequence 1 , 2 , . . . ,  , and the sequences 1, 2, . . . ,  and 1, 2, . . . , . Let
 2 + . Clearly  <  < . If there exist infinitely many    such that   [ , ],
then set +1 , +1 , and pick +1 >  such that +1  [ , ]. If there are not
infinitely many  such that   [ , ], then it must be true that there are infinitely many
   such that   [, ]. In this case pick +1 , +1 , and pick +1 >  such
that +1  [, ].

    We now have the sequences defined. What is left to prove is that lim  = lim .
The limits exist as the sequences are monotone. In the construction,  -  is cut in half in
each step. Therefore, +1 - +1 = 2 - . By induction,

                                                    -  = 2-1 1 - 1 .

    Let          lim        .  As  {   }      is  monotone,

                                          =1

                                               = sup{ :   }.

Let  lim  = inf{ :   }. Since  <  for all , then   . As the sequences
are monotone, then for all , we have (why?)

                                        -    -  = 2-1 1 - 1 .

Because     1-1   is  arbitrarily     small       and        -         0,   we   have      -       =  0.  Finish  by  the  squeeze

    Yet another proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem is to show the following claim,
which is left as a challenging exercise. Claim: Every sequence has a monotone subsequence.

2.3.4 Infinite limits

Just as for infima and suprema, it is possible to allow certain limits to be infinite. That is,
we write lim  =  or lim  = - for certain divergent sequences.

Definition      2.3.9.    We    say   {   }       diverges         to  infinity      if  for   every        ,     there  exists  an

                                              =1
   such that for all   , we have  > . In this case we write

                                                       lim  .

                                                       

Similarly, if for every    there exists an    such that for all   , we have  < ,
          {   }
we   say              diverges  to    minus       infinity   and     we    write
                  =1

                                                       lim                  -.

                                                       

    With this definition and allowing  and -, we can write lim  for any monotone
sequence.

Proposition     2.3.10.   Suppose     {   }       is   a     monotone       unbounded          sequence.  Then

                                              =1

                                      lim  =                     if  {   }       is  increasing,

                                                                             =1
                                                                            
                                                  - if {}=1 is decreasing.

Proof. The case of monotone increasing follows from Exercise 2.3.14 part c) below. Suppose
{   }
            is  decreasing      and   unbounded.             That      the  sequence           is  unbounded      means    that  for
        =1
every   , there is an    such that  < . By monotonicity,    <  for all
  . Therefore, lim  = -.
                                                                                                                                 

Example 2.3.11:

                          lim  = ,                lim 2 = ,                          lim - = -.

                                                                                     

We leave verification to the reader.

     We may also allow lim inf and lim sup to take on the values  and -, so that we can

apply lim inf and lim sup to absolutely any sequence, not just a bounded one. Unfortunately,
                  {   }               {  }
the  sequences                  and               are  not       sequences        of     real  numbers    but  of  extended  real
                          =1                  =1
numbers. In particular,  can equal  for some , and  can equal -. So we have no

definition for the limits. But since the extended real numbers are still an ordered set, we

can take suprema and infima.

     Sometimes    it  is  said  that  {   }       converges  to  infinity.

Definition            2.3.12.     Let  {   }              be  an  unbounded              sequence  of     real       numbers.       Define

                                               =1
sequences of extended real numbers by  sup{ :   } and  inf{ :   }.

Define

                lim sup  inf{ :   }, and lim inf  sup{ :   }.
                                                                                         

       This definition agrees with the definition for bounded sequences.

Proposition 2.3.13.               Let  {   }              be  an  unbounded         sequence.     Define  {   }         and      {  }        as
                      {   }                                       {  }
            Then                  is           =1         and                 is  increasing.     If              =1                     =1
above.                        =1       decreasing,                        =1                           is a real number for every

, then lim sup  = lim . If  is a real number for every , then lim inf  =
lim .

Proof. As before,  = sup{                                 :   }  sup{                    :    + 1} = +1.                So       {   }       is
                                       {  }
decreasing.           Similarly,                      is  increasing.                                                                    =1
                                               =1
       If  the  sequence          {   }       is  a   sequence    of  real    numbers,   then     lim                =  inf{     :         }.
                                                              {   }                                                              {   }
This     follows      from                =1  2.1.10                          bounded    and      Proposition        2.3.10
                            Theorem                       if          =1  is                                                 if          =1  is
unbounded. We proceed similarly with {}=1.
                                                                                                                                             

    The definition behaves as expected with lim sup and lim inf, see exercises 2.3.13 and
2.3.14.

Example 2.3.14: Suppose  0 for odd  and   for even . Then  =  for all ,
since for every , there exists an even  such that  =   . On the other hand,  = 0
for all , as for every , the set { :   } consists of 0 and positive numbers. So,

                      lim  does not exist,                            lim sup  = ,                 lim inf  = 0.

2.4 Cauchy sequences

Note: less than a lecture

    Often we wish to describe a certain number by a sequence that converges to it. In this
case, it is impossible to use the number itself in the proof that the sequence converges. It
would be nice if we could check for convergence without knowing the limit.

Definition  2.4.1.  A  sequence     {   }       is  a  Cauchy  sequence  if  for  every    >  0  there  exists  an

                                            =1
   such that for all    and all   , we have

                                                | - | < .

    Informally, being Cauchy means that the terms of the sequence are eventually all
arbitrarily close to each other. We might expect such a sequence to be convergent, and we
would be correct due to  having the least-upper-bound property. Before we prove this
fact, we look at some examples.

Example 2.4.2:   The   sequence     {1/}        is     a  Cauchy  sequence.

                                            =1
    Proof: Given  > 0, find  such that  > 2/. Then for ,   , we have 1/ < /2 and

1/ < /2. Therefore, for ,   , we have

                                       1 - 1  1 + 1 < 2 + 2 = .                                   + 1. Then
Example 2.4.3: The sequence (-1) =1   is not a Cauchy sequence.

    Proof: Given any   , take    to be any even number, and let 

                                    (-1) - (-1) = (-1) - (-1)+1
                                                       = |1 - (-1)| = 2.

Therefore, for any   2 the definition cannot be satisfied, and the sequence is not Cauchy.

Proposition 2.4.4. If a sequence is Cauchy, then it is bounded.

Proof.  Suppose     {   }       is  Cauchy.     Pick an  such that for all ,   , we have

                            =1
| - | < 1. In particular, for all   ,

                                                | - | < 1.

By the reverse triangle inequality, || - ||  | - | < 1. Hence for   ,

                                                || < 1 + || .

Let
                                max |1| , |2| , . . . , |-1| , 1 + || .

Then ||   for all   .

Theorem 2.4.5. A sequence of real numbers is Cauchy if and only if it converges.

Proof.  Suppose      {   }       converges   to   ,  and  let    >  0 be given.     Then there exists an  such

that for   ,                 =1

                                                  | - | <  .
                                                                 2
Hence for    and   ,

                     | - | = | -  +  - |  | - | + | - | <  +  = .
                                                                                         22

     Alright,    that  direction  was  easy.      Now   suppose     {   }       is  Cauchy.  We  have   shown  that
{   }
            is  bounded.  For        bounded      sequence,                 =1                  and        is  where
        =1                        a                            liminf  and      limsup  exist,       this

we use the least-upper-bound property. If we show that

                                             lim inf  = lim sup  ,
                                                               

then  {   }       must  be  convergent       by   Proposition    2.3.5.

              =1
     Define  lim sup  and  lim inf .                                            By Theorem      2.3.4,  there  exist
                        }               } ,
subsequences         {        and    {            such  that
                          =1              =1

                                     lim  =  and lim  = .
                                                                    

Given an  > 0, there exists an 1 such that  -  < /3 for all   1 and an 2 such
that  -  < /3 for all   2. There also exists an 3 such that | - | < /3 for all
,   3. Let  max{1, 2, 3}. If   , then    and   . Hence,

                                 | - | =  -  +  -  +  - 

                                          -  +  -  +  - 
                                        <  +  +  = .

                                           333

As | - | <  for all  > 0, then  =  and the sequence converges.                                                 

Remark 2.4.6. The statement of this theorem is sometimes used to define the completeness

property of the real numbers. We say a set is Cauchy-complete (or sometimes just complete)

if every Cauchy sequence converges to something in the set. Above, we proved that

as  has the least-upper-bound property,  is Cauchy-complete. One can construct 

via "completing"  by "throwing in" just enough points to make all Cauchy sequences

converge (we omit the details). The resulting field has the least-upper-bound property. The

advantage of defining completeness via Cauchy sequences is that it generalizes to more

abstract settings such as metric spaces, see chapter 7.

     The Cauchy criterion is stronger than |+1 - | (or + -  for a fixed ) going to

zero as  goes to infinity. When we get to the partial sums of the harmonic series (see

Example 2.5.11 in the next section), we will have a sequence such that +1 -  = 1/,
     {   }                                                                          + -      = 0 for every   
yet              is  divergent.   In  fact,  for  that  sequence,   lim
             =1
(compare Exercise 2.5.12). The key point in the definition of Cauchy is that  and  vary

independently and can be arbitrarily far apart.

2.5 Series

Note: 2 lectures

    A fundamental object in mathematics is that of a series. In fact, when the foundations
of analysis were being developed, the motivation was to understand series. Understanding
series is important in applications of analysis. For example, solutions to differential
equations are often given as series, and differential equations are the basis for understanding
almost all of modern science.

2.5.1 Definition

Definition 2.5.1. Given a sequence {}=1, we write the formal object

                                                      

                                                         

                                                     =1

and  call  it  a  series.  A  series  converges  if  the  sequence   {   }        defined  by

                                                                            =1

                                        

                                                  = 1 + 2 + · · · + 

                                        =1

converges. The numbers  are called partial sums. If the series converges, we write

                                                  

                                                      = lim  .

                                                                
                                                 =1

In this case, we cheat a little and treat                    as  a  number.                                
                           {   }                     =1
                                                                                                           =1  is
If   the   sequence               =1  diverges,  we  say  the    series  is  divergent.  In  this  case,

simply a formal object and not a number.

In other words, for a convergent series, we have

                                                                 

                                        =1        = lim  .

                                                          
                                                                 =1

We only have this equality if the limit on the right actually exists. If the series does not

converge, the right-hand side does not make sense (the limit does not exist). Therefore, be
               
careful as     =1          means  two  different     things  (a  notation    for  the  series  itself  or  the  limit  of

the partial sums), and you must use context to distinguish.

Remark 2.5.2. It is sometimes convenient to start the series at an index different from 1. For

instance, we can write                                       

                                                      = -1.

                                                 =0       =1

The left-hand side is more convenient to write.

Remark 2.5.3. It is common to write the series           

                                                         =1  as

                                        1 + 2 + 3 + · · ·

with the understanding that the ellipsis indicates a series and not a simple sum. We do not
use this notation as it is the sort of informal notation that leads to mistakes in proofs.

Example 2.5.4: The series                  1
converges and the limit is 1. That is,     =1 2

                                 1      = lim            1 = 1.

                                 =1 2  =1 2

    Proof: We need the equality

                                         1             + 21 = 1.
                                        =1 2

The equality is immediate when  = 1. The proof for general  follows by induction, which
we leave to the reader. See Figure 2.7 for an illustration.

       0                         1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8                                         1
                                                                                    1/8
                          1/2                            1/4               1/8

                          =1 2      2

    Let  be the partial sum. We write

                                                       1 = 1 = 1 .

                          |1 - | = 1 -
                                           =1 2             22

       1                                                                                    
The sequence 2 =1, and therefore |1 - | =1, converges to zero. So, {}=1 converges
to 1.

Proposition 2.5.5. Suppose -1 <  < 1. Then the geometric series                       converges,  and
                                                                                =0

                                          = 1 .
                                        =0 1 -

Details of the proof are left as an exercise. The proof consists of showing

                                                  -1 = 1 -   ,
                                                 =0 1 - 

and then taking the limit as  goes to . Geometric series is one of the most important
series, and in fact it is one of the few series for which we can so explicitly find the limit.

As for sequences we can talk about a tail of a series.

Proposition 2.5.6. Let               be  a  series.   Let          .  Then
                              =1

                                  converges if and only if                          converges.

                                                                        

                 =1                                                =

Proof. We look at partial sums of the two series (for   )

                                                      -1                 

                                            =                      + .

                                       =1             =1              =

Note that  -1    is       a   fixed  number.    Use     Proposition     2.2.5       to  finish  the  proof.                 
           =1

2.5.2 Cauchy series

Definition 2.5.7. A series                  is  said  to  be  Cauchy    or  a   Cauchy   series      if  the  sequence      of
               {   }              =1

partial  sums         =1  is  a  Cauchy  sequence.

A sequence of real numbers converges if and only if it is Cauchy. Therefore, a series is
                                                                   
convergent if and only if it is Cauchy. The series                 =1       is  Cauchy   if     and      only  if  for  every

 > 0, there exists an   , such that for every    and   , we have

                                                           

                                                 -                    < .

                                            =1             =1

Without loss of generality we assume  < . Then we write

                                                                   

                                          -                   =          < .

                                     =1             =1             =+1

We have proved the following simple proposition.

Proposition 2.5.8. The series                   is  Cauchy     if  and  only    if  for  every    >      0,  there  exists  an
                                       =1
   such that for every    and every  > ,

2.5.3 Basic properties

Proposition 2.5.9. Let          be  a       convergent  series.  Then     the  sequence  {   }       is  convergent
and                     =1
                                                                                                 =1

                                               lim  = 0.

                                               

Proof. Let  > 0 be given. As                   is  convergent,   it  is  Cauchy.  Thus   we  find    an       such
that for every   ,              =1

                                               +1

                                            >        = |+1| .

                                               =+1

Hence for every    + 1, we have || < .                                                                              

Example 2.5.10: If   1 or   -1, then the geometric series                                diverges.
                                                                                =0
    Proof: || = ||  1 = 1. The terms do not go to zero and the series cannot converge.

    So if a series converges, the terms of the series go to zero. The implication, however,
goes only one way. Let us give an example.

Example 2.5.11: The series          1/      diverges    (despite     the  fact  that  lim    1/      =   0).  This  is
                              =1
the famous harmonic series.

    Proof: We will show that the sequence of partial sums is unbounded, and hence cannot
converge. Write the partial sums  for  = 2 as:

                        1 = 1,

                        2 = (1) + 1 ,
                                       2

                        4 = (1) + 1 + 1 + 1 ,
                                       2 34

                        8 = (1) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ,
                                       2 34 5678

Notice 1/3 + 1/4  1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 and 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8  1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/2.                     More

                             2 1 2  1 = (2-1) 1 = 1 .

     The divergence of the harmonic series was known long before the theory of series was made rigorous.
The proof we give is the earliest proof and was given by Nicole Oresme (1323?-1382).
2.5. SERIES                                                                                                      91

Therefore,

                                                    2 1           1 + 1 = 1 +  .

                           2 = 1 +

                                            =1

As  { /2}       is  unbounded     by   the   Archimedean        property,   that   means  that  {2 }         is  un-
                                  {   }                                 {   }
            =1                                                                                           =1
bounded,  and       therefore            =1  is  unbounded.     Hence          =1  diverges,  and  consequently

=1    1/  diverges.

    Like finite sums, convergent series behave linearly. That is, we can multiply them by

constants and add them and these operations are done term by term.

Proposition 2.5.12 (Linearity of series). Let    and                                               be  convergent
series. Then                                                                              =1
                                                                            =1  and

(i)                 is  a  convergent  series    and
      =1

                                                                    

                                                          =  .

                                                     =1             =1

(ii)                +  )   is  a  convergent     series  and

      =1(

                                                                            

                                             ( + ) =                 +         .

                                       =1                       =1        =1

Proof. For the first item, we simply write the th partial sum

                                                                

                                                      =   .

                                                 =1             =1

We look at the right-hand side and note that the constant multiple of a convergent sequence

is convergent. Hence, we take the limit of both sides to obtain the result.
    For the second item we also look at the th partial sum

                                                                        

                                       ( + ) =                   +           .

                                  =1                     =1             =1

We look at the right-hand side and note that the sum of convergent sequences is convergent.

Hence, we take the limit of both sides to obtain the proposition.                                                

    An example of a useful application of the first item is the following formula. If || < 1

and   , then                                         

                                                         =       .
                                                     = 1 -

The formula follows by using the geometric series and multiplying by :

                                                               

                                     = + = .

                                   =0             =0           =

    Multiplying series is not as simple as adding, see the next section. It is not true, of

course, that we multiply term by term. That strategy does not work even for finite sums:
( + )( + )   + .

2.5.4 Absolute convergence

As monotone sequences are easier to work with than arbitrary sequences, it is usually
                              
easier to work with series    =1   ,  where               0  for  all  .   The   sequence   of   partial     sums

is then monotone increasing and converges if it is bounded above. Let us formalize this

statement as a proposition.

Proposition 2.5.13. If   0 for all , then                         converges  if  and  only  if   the  sequence   of
partial sums is bounded above.                        =1

    As the limit of a monotone increasing sequence is the supremum, then when   0 for

all , we have the inequality

                                                        

                                                .

                                        =1            =1

If we allow infinite limits, the inequality still holds even when the series diverges to infinity,
although in that case it is not terribly useful.

    We will see that the following common criterion for convergence of series has big
implications for how the series can be manipulated.

Definition 2.5.14. A series          converges      absolutely    if  the  series        ||      converges.  If  a
                              =1                                                     =1

series converges, but does not converge absolutely, we say it converges conditionally.

Proposition 2.5.15. If the series         converges       absolutely,      then  it  converges.
                                   =1

Proof. A series is convergent if and only if it is Cauchy. Hence suppose                         |    |  is  Cauchy.
                                                                                         =1
That is, for every  > 0, there exists an  such that for all    and all  > , we have

                                                      

                                        || =              || < .

                                   =+1            =+1

We apply the triangle inequality for a finite sum to obtain

                                                      

                                                          || < .

                                   =+1            =+1

Hence        is  Cauchy,     and   therefore  it  converges.                                                     
       =1
2.5. SERIES                                                                                        93

If            converges    absolutely,     the  limits  of                          are      generally

         =1                                                 =1  and   =1 ||

different. Computing one does not help us compute the other. However, the computation

above leads to a useful inequality for absolutely convergent series, a series version of the

triangle inequality, a proof of which we leave as an exercise:

                                                    

                                                || .

                                          =1     =1

    Absolutely convergent series have many wonderful properties. For example, absolutely
convergent series can be rearranged arbitrarily, or we can multiply such series together
easily. Conditionally convergent series on the other hand often do not behave as one would
expect. See the next section.

    We leave as an exercise to show that

                                                       (-1)
                                                     =1 

converges, although the reader should finish this section before trying. On the other hand,
we proved

                                                        1
                                                       =1 

                                          (-1)

diverges. Therefore, =1  is a conditionally convergent series.

2.5.5 Comparison test and the -series

We noted above that for a series with positive terms to converge the terms not only have to
go to zero, but they have to go to zero "fast enough." If we know about convergence of a
certain series, we can use the following comparison test to see if the terms of another series
go to zero "fast enough."

Proposition 2.5.16 (Comparison test). Let                         be  series  such  that  0        
                                                            =1
for all   .                                     =1  and

(i) If         converges,  then  so  does     
(ii) If  =1
                                              =1 .

               diverges,  then  so  does   
         =1
                                           =1 .

Proof. As the terms of the series are all nonnegative, the sequences of partial sums are both
monotone increasing. Since    for all , the partial sums satisfy for all 

                                                    

                                                .                                                (2.1)

                                          =1     =1
94                                                        CHAPTER 2. SEQUENCES AND SERIES

If the series        converges,     the  partial   sums   for  the  series  are  bounded.   Therefore,  the
               =1                                                                                   
right-hand side of (2.1) is bounded for all ; there exists some    such that
                                                                                                    =1   
for all , and so
                                                     

                                                 .

                                         =1         =1
                                =1
Hence the partial sums for            are    also  bounded.    Since  the   partial  sums   are  a  monotone

increasing sequence they are convergent. The first item is thus proved.
                          
    On the other hand if  =1        diverges,   the  sequence   of  partial  sums     must  be   unbounded
                                                                            
since it is monotone increasing. That is, the partial sums for              =1       are  eventually  bigger

than any real number. Putting this together with (2.1) we see that for every   , there is

a  such that                                              

                                             .

                                              =1          =1                
                                =1                                          =1
Hence the partial sums for               are  also  unbounded,      and               also  diverges.   

    A useful series to use with the comparison test is the -series.

Proposition 2.5.17 (-series or the -test). For   , the series

                                                1
                                                =1 

converges if and only if  > 1.

Proof.  First suppose     1.  As         1, we have    1    1.  Since            1  diverges,    1
                                                                            =1   
diverge for all   1 by the comparison test.                                                      =1  must

    Now suppose  > 1. We proceed as we did for the harmonic series, but instead of

showing that the sequence of partial sums is unbounded, we show that it is bounded. The

terms of the series are positive, so the sequence of partial sums is monotone increasing and

converges if it is bounded above. Let  denote the th partial sum.

                          1 = 1,

                          3 = (1) + 21 + 31 ,

                          7 = (1) + 21 + 31 + 41 + 51 + 61 + 71 ,
                              ...

                     2-1 = 1 +      -1 2+1-1 1      .

                                    =1 =2 

     We have not yet defined  for  > 0 and an arbitrary   . The definition is  exp( ln ). We
will define the logarithm and the exponential in §5.4. For now you can just think of rational  where
/ = (1/). See also Exercise 1.2.17.

Instead of estimating from below, we estimate from above. As  is positive, then 2 < 3,

and hence    1  +    1  <   1     +  1    Similarly,      1  +  1  +  1  +  1   <  1   +  1  +   1  +  1    Therefore, for

                                                              =1

As    >  1,  then    1  <   1.    Proposition     2.5.5      says  that
                   2-1

converges. Thus,

                                                      -1    1                        1 .

                                  2-1 < 1 +                           1+

                                                      =1                      =1

For  every     there    is  a        2    such  that         2  -    1,  and  as  {   }      is  a  monotone  sequence,

  2-1. So for all ,                                                                      =1

                                                                              
                                                   < 1 + -1 1
                                                                =1 2

Thus the sequence of partial sums is bounded, and the series converges.                                                   

    Neither the -series test nor the comparison test tell us what the sum converges to.

They only tell us that a limit of the partial sums exists. For instance, while we know that
                                                                                                             
=1    1/2    converges,     it  is   far  harder  to  find      that  the   limit  is  2/6.  If  we  treat   =1  1/   as  a

function of , we get the so-called Riemann  (zeta) function. Understanding the behavior

of this function contains one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics today

and has applications in seemingly unrelated areas such as modern cryptography.

Example 2.5.18: The series                        1   converges.            
                                          =1    2+1                         =1
                       1          1                                               1                          -series
    Proof:   First,  2+1    <     2  for  all       .     The   series            2  converges      by  the           test.
                                                    
Therefore, by the comparison test,                  =1      1   converges.
                                                          2+1

    Demonstration of this fact is what made the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Paul Euler (1707-1783)

famous.

2.5.6 Ratio test

                                                                                                                                      +1

Suppose  > 0. The ratio of two subsequent terms in the geometric series =0  is  = ,
and the series converges whenever  < 1. Just as for sequences, this fact can be generalized
to more arbitrary series as long as we have such a ratio "in the limit." We then compare the
tail of a series to the geometric series.

Proposition 2.5.19 (Ratio test). Let               be  a  series,        0  for  all  ,  and  such  that
                                           =1

                                     lim |+1|               exists.
                                           ||

(i) If  < 1, then               converges  absolutely.
(ii) If  > 1, then        =1

                                diverges.
                          =1

    Although the test as stated is often sufficient, it can be strengthened a bit, see
Exercise 2.5.6.

Proof.  If   >  1,  then  Lemma  2.2.12    says  that  the  sequence     {   }        diverges.     Since it is a

                                                                                 =1
necessary condition for the convergence of series that the terms go to zero, we know that

=1        must  diverge.                               
                                                       =1
    Thus suppose  < 1. We will argue that                   ||     must  converge.       The  proof  is   similar

to that of Lemma 2.2.12. Of course   0. Pick  such that  <  < 1. As  -  > 0, there

exists an    such that for all   ,

                                           |+1| || -  <  - .

Therefore,                                 |+1| || < .

For  >  (that is for    + 1), write

        || = || |+1| |+2| || |+ · · · || < | 1| |-1| |  · · ·  = || - = (|| -) .

For  > , write the partial sum as

                                                          

                              || = || +                     ||

                                    =1                 =+1

                                           || + || -                     

                                 =                                            .

                                    =1                               =+1

As 0 <  < 1, the geometric series                   converges,  so                converges               as  well.  We

The right-hand side is a number that does not depend on . Hence the sequence of partial
                                                                                         
sums of  =1      ||  is   bounded  and          =1  ||  is  convergent.    Thus          =1         is    absolutely

convergent.                                                                                                          

Example 2.5.20: The series                           2
                                                    =1 !

converges absolutely.     lim  2(+1)/( + 1)! = lim 2 = 0.
    Proof: We write

                           2 /!                               + 1

Therefore, the series converges absolutely by the ratio test.

that is sufficient.

2.6 More on series

Note: up to 2-3 lectures (optional, can safely be skipped or covered partially)

2.6.1 Root test

A test similar to the ratio test is the so-called root test. The proof of this test is similar. Again,

the idea is to generalize what happens for the geometric series.

Proposition 2.6.1 (Root test). Let               be  a  series  and  let
                                         =1

                                          lim sup ||1/ .

                                                    

(i) If  < 1, then                converges  absolutely.
(ii) If  > 1, then       =1

                                 diverges.
                         =1

Proof.    If    >  1, then there exists  a  subsequence  {      }         such that     =  lim | |1/ .

                                                                  =1
Let  be such that  >  > 1. There exists an  such that for all   , we have
| |1/              > 1, or in other words | | >                                                              
              >         |} ,                               > 1.      The     subsequence   {    |        |}  =1  ,  and

therefore     also  {|     =1  cannot  possibly  converge  to   zero,     and  so  the  series  diverges.

Now suppose  < 1. Pick  such that  <  < 1. By definition of limit supremum, there

is an  such that for all   ,

                                       sup ||1/ :    < .

Therefore, for all   ,                      or in other words                || < .
                           ||1/ <  ,

Let  > , and estimate the th partial sum:

                                                                                   

                       || =       || +               ||              || +               .

                    =1         =1           =+1                 =1             =+1

                                                                           +1
As 0 <  < 1, the geometric series =+1  converges to 1- . As everything is positive,

                                                                + +1 1 -  .

                                        ||           ||

                                    =1           =1

Thus the sequence of partial sums of                       is   bounded,       and   the  series         converges.
                   
                   =1                            =1 ||

Therefore,               converges  absolutely.                                                                     

In case  = , see Exercise 2.3.20. Alternatively, note that if  = , then || =1 1/  is unbounded, and
thus  so  is  {  } .

                   =1

2.6.2 Alternating series test

The tests we have seen so far only addressed absolute convergence. The following test

gives a large supply of conditionally convergent series.

Proposition  2.6.2  (Alternating   series).     Let  {   }       be  a  monotone     decreasing           sequence  of

                                                             =1
positive real numbers such that lim  = 0. Then
                               

                                                        converges.

                                      (-1) 

                                  =1

Proof. Let              (-1)   be  the      th  partial  sum.    Then
                    =1

               2                                                                  
     2 = (-1)  = (-1 + 2) + · · · + (-2-1 + 2) = (-2-1 + 2 ).

               =1                                                             =1

The  sequence  {   }       is  decreasing,  so  (-2 -1  +  2 )       0  for  all  .  Thus,           the  subsequence

                       =1
{2}=1 of partial sums is a decreasing sequence. Similarly, (2 - 2+1)  0, and so

                  2 = -1 + (2 - 3) + · · · + (2-2 - 2-1) + 2  -1.

The intuition behind the bound 0  2  -1 is illustrated in Figure 2.8.

    As {2}=1 is decreasing and bounded below, it converges. Let  lim 2. We
wish to show that lim  =  (and not just for the subsequence). Given  > 0, pick 
such that |2 - | < /2 whenever   . Since lim  = 0, we also make  possibly
larger to obtain 2+1 < /2 whenever   . Suppose   2 + 1. If  = 2, then
   + 1/2   and | - | = |2 - | < /2 < . If  = 2 + 1, then also   . Notice
2+1 = 2 - 2+1. Thus

102                                               CHAPTER 2. SEQUENCES AND SERIES

    Notably, there exist conditionally convergent series where the absolute values of the
terms go to zero arbitrarily slowly. The series

                                                       (-1)
                                                     =1 

converges for arbitrarily small  > 0, but it does not converge absolutely when   1.

2.6.3 Rearrangements

Absolutely convergent series behave as we imagine they should. For example, absolutely

convergent series can be summed in any order whatsoever. Nothing of the sort holds for

conditionally convergent series (see Example 2.6.4 and Exercise 2.6.3).

Consider a series

                                           

                                              .

                                          =1

Given a bective function  :   , the corresponding rearrangement is the series:

                                           

                                              ().

                                          =1

We simply sum the series in a different order.

Proposition 2.6.3. Let        be  an  absolutely  convergent  series  converging  to  a  number  .  Let
                        =1    
 :    be a bection. Then      =1  ()                                                         .
                                          is  absolutely  convergent  and  converges     to

    In other words, a rearrangement of an absolutely convergent series converges (absolutely)
to the same number.

Proof. Let  > 0 be given. As          is  absolutely  convergent,     take    such       that
                              =1

                          -  <  and                        || <  .
                        =1 2                              =+1 2

So      ()  converges    to  .  To   see  that  the  convergence  is  absolute,  we  apply  the  argument

          =1  |   |
above to             to  show  that  =1 () converges.                                            

                                                                                                                          (-1)+1

Example 2.6.4: Let us show that the alternating harmonic series =1  , which does
not converge absolutely, can be rearranged to converge to anything. The odd terms and the
even terms diverge to plus infinity and minus infinity respectively (prove this!):

                          1 = , and                         -1 = -.
                         =1 2 - 1                         =1 2

          (-1)+1
Let        for simplicity, let an arbitrary number    be given, and set (1) 1.
Suppose we have defined () for all   . If

                                           

                                              ()  ,

                                          =1

then let ( + 1)  be the smallest odd    that we have not used yet, that is, ()  
for all   . Otherwise, let ( + 1)  be the smallest even  that we have not yet used.

    By construction,  :    is one-to-one. It is also onto, because if we keep adding
either odd (resp. even) terms, eventually we pass  and switch to the evens (resp. odds).

So we switch infinitely many times.
    Finally, let  be the  where we just pass  and switch. For example, suppose we have

just switched from odd to even (so we start subtracting), and let  >  be where we first

switch back from even to odd. Then

                                1 -1 -1 1
                         +            () >               () >  -             .
                             ( ) =1 =1                                    ( )

Similarly for switching in the other direction. Therefore, the sum up to  - 1 is within
                                                                                              ( )

                                 =1 =1 ()

Here is an example to illustrate the proof. Suppose  = 1.2, then the order is

     1 + 1/3 - 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/4 + 1/11 + 1/13 - 1/6 + 1/15 + 1/17 + 1/19 - 1/8 + · · · .

At this point we are no more than 1/8 from the limit. See Figure 2.9.

2.6.4 Multiplication of series

As we have already mentioned, multiplication of series is somewhat harder than addition.
If at least one of the series converges absolutely, then we can use the following theorem.
For this result, it is convenient to start the series at 0, rather than at 1.

Theorem 2.6.5 (Mertens' theorem). Suppose                                      are            two  convergent  series,
                                                                         =0
                                                      =0  and
converging to  and  respectively. Suppose at least one of the series converges absolutely. Define

                                                                                            

                              0 + 1-1 + · · · + 0 = - .

                                                                                          =0

Then the series              converges   to   .
    The series       =0

                             is  called  the  Cauchy  product  of                             
                     =0
                                                                    =0  and                   =0 .

Proved by the German mathematician Franz Mertens (1840-1927).
2.6. MORE ON SERIES                                                                                      105

Proof. Suppose           converges     absolutely,  and   let    >  0  be  given.  In  this  proof     instead
                =0
of picking complicated estimates just to make the final estimate come out as less than , let

us simply obtain an estimate that depends on  and can be made arbitrarily small.

    Write                                                        

                                            ,                       .

                                        =0                     =0

We rearrange the th partial sum of          =0 :

                                           

                          -  =                    - - 

                =0                      =0 =0

                                           

                                     =         - - 

                                        =0

                                           

                                     =       ( - )- +  - 

                                        =0

                                          

                                             | - | |-| + || | - |

                                        =0

We can surely make the second term on the right-hand side small. The trick is to handle

the first term. Pick  such that for all   , we have | - | <  and also | - | < .
                                                                                                         
As  =0       converges  absolutely,  make   sure  that    is   large  enough  such     that  for  all      ,

                                            

                                              || < .

                                           =

As           converges,  then  max      sup | - | :  = 0, 1, 2, . . . is finite. Take   2.
    =0
In particular  -  + 1 > . So

                                 -                                     

               | - | |-| =              | - | |-| +                        | - | |-|

           =0                    =0                              =-+1

                                                        -1

                                        || max +                ||

                                 =                      =0

                                              

                                max +  || .

                                              =0

Therefore, for   2, we have

                         

                -              | - | |-| + || | - |

           =0            =0

                                                                              

                          max +  || + ||  =  max + || + || .

                                        =0                                    =0
106                                                CHAPTER 2. SEQUENCES AND SERIES

The expression in the parenthesis on the right-hand side is a fixed number. Hence, we can
                                                                                                
make the right-hand side arbitrarily small by picking a small enough  > 0. So
                                                                                                =0 
converges to .
                                                                                                      

Example 2.6.6: If both series are only conditionally convergent, the Cauchy product
series need not even converge. Suppose we take  =  = (-1)  1+1 . The series
                
            =0    converges     by  the  alternating  series  test;  however,    it  does  not  converge
=0  =
absolutely as can be seen from the -test. Let us look at the Cauchy product.

 = (-1)  1 + 1 +                    1 +···+  1                                               1.
                   + 1 2            3( - 1)           +1                             ( + 1)( -  + 1)
                                                              = (-1)

                                                                             =0

Therefore,                              1  
                                ( + 1)( -  + 1) =0
                || =                                        1 = 1.
                                                      ( + 1)( + 1)
                            =0

The terms do not go to zero and hence              cannot     converge.
                                             =0

2.6.5 Power series

Fix 0  . A power series about 0 is a series of the form

                                                                    

                                                      ( - 0).

                                                                   =0

A power series is really a function of , and many important functions in analysis can be
written as a power series. We use the convention that 00 = 1 (that is, if  = 0 and  = 0).

    A power series is said to be convergent if there is at least one   0 that makes the series
converge. If  = 0, then the series always converges since all terms except the first are
zero. If the series does not converge for any point   0, we say that the series is divergent.

Example 2.6.7: The series                     1 
                                             =0 !

is absolutely convergent for all    using the ratio test: For any   

                                1/( + 1)! +1                         = 0.
                  lim                         = lim
                   (1/!)                                + 1

Recall from calculus that this series converges to .

Example 2.6.8: The series                     1 
                                             =1 
2.6. MORE ON SERIES                                                                      107

converges absolutely for all   (-1, 1) via the ratio test:

                           1/( + 1) +1                          = || < 1.
              lim                    = lim ||
               (1/)                            + 1

                                     (-1)
The series converges at  = -1, as =1  converges by the alternating series test. But
the power series does not converge absolutely at  = -1, because            1  does  not  converge.
                                                                 =1        
The series diverges at  = 1. When || > 1, then the series diverges via the ratio test.

Example 2.6.9: The series

diverges for all   0. Let us apply the root test

                         lim sup | |1/ = lim sup  || = .
                                                  

Therefore, the series diverges for all   0.

Convergence of power series in general works analogously to the three examples above.

Proposition 2.6.10. Let          -  0)  be   a  power  series.  If the series is convergent, then

                           =0 (
either it converges absolutely at all   , or there exists a number , such that the series converges

absolutely on the interval (0 - , 0 + ) and diverges when  < 0 -  or  > 0 + .

    The number  is called the radius of convergence of the power series. We write  =  if

the series converges for all , and we write  = 0 if the series is divergent. At the endpoints,
that is, if  = 0 +  or  = 0 - , the proposition says nothing, and the series might or
might not converge. See Figure 2.10. In Example 2.6.8, the radius of convergence is  = 1,
in Example 2.6.7, the radius of convergence is  = , and in Example 2.6.9, the radius of

convergence is  = 0.

We apply the root test,

      = lim sup ( - 0) 1/ = | - 0| lim sup ||1/ = | - 0| .
                                                      

If  = , then  =  for every   0, and the series diverges by the root test. On the other
hand, if  = 0, then  = 0 for every , and the series converges absolutely for all .

    Suppose 0 <  < . The series converges absolutely if 1 >  =  | - 0|, that is,

                                      | - 0| < 1/.

The series diverges when 1 <  =  | - 0|, or

                                      | - 0| > 1/.

Letting  1/ completes the proof.                                                                 

It may be useful to restate what we have learned in the proof as a separate proposition.

Proposition 2.6.11. Let      (   -  0)  be  a  power  series,  and  let
                         =0

                                  lim sup ||1/ .

                                            

If  = , the power series is divergent. If  = 0, then the power series converges everywhere.
Otherwise, the radius of convergence  = 1/.

    Often, the radius of convergence is written as  = 1/ in all three cases, with the
understanding of what  should be if  = 0 or  = .

Convergent power series can be added and multiplied together, and multiplied by

constants. The proposition has a straightforward proof using what we know about series

in general, and power series in particular. We leave the proof to the reader.

Proposition 2.6.12. Let  =0 ( - 0) and         =0                   be   two  convergent  power  series

with radius of convergence at least  > 0 and   . Then for all  such that | - 0| < , we

have

    For all  with | - 0| < , we have two convergent series so their term-by-term addition
and multiplication by constants follows by the previous section. As for such  the series
converges absolutely, we can apply Merten's theorem to find the product of two series.
Consequently, after performing the algebraic operations, the radius of convergence of the
resulting series is at least . The radius of convergence of the result could be strictly larger
than the radius of convergence of either of the series we started with. See the exercises.

    Let us look at some examples of power series. Polynomials are simply finite power
series: A polynomial is a power series where the  are zero for all  large enough. We
expand a polynomial as a power series about any point 0 by writing the polynomial as a
polynomial in ( - 0). For example, 22 - 3 + 4 as a power series around 0 = 1 is

                                  22 - 3 + 4 = 3 + ( - 1) + 2( - 1)2.

    We can also expand rational functions (that is, ratios of polynomials) as power series,
although we will not completely prove this fact here. Notice that a series for a rational
function only defines the function on an interval even if the function is defined elsewhere.
For example, for the geometric series, we have that for   (-1, 1),

                                                    1 =   .
                                                 1 -  =0

The  series  diverges  when  ||  >  1,  even  though   1  is  defined  for  all      1.
                                                      1-

We can use the geometric series together with rules for addition and multiplication

of power series to expand rational functions as power series around 0, as long as the

denominator is not zero at 0. We state without proof that this is always possible, and we

give an example of such a computation using the geometric series.

Example 2.6.13:  Let us expand                as a power series around the origin (0     = 0) and
                                    1+2+2
find the radius of convergence.

Write 1 + 2 + 2 = (1 + )2 = 1 - (-) 2, and suppose || < 1. Compute

Using the formula for the product of series, we obtain 0 = 1, 1 = -1 - 1 = -2, 2 =
1 + 1 + 1 = 3, etc. Hence, for || < 1,

                                                = (-1)+1 .

The radius of convergence is at least 1. We leave it to the reader to verify that the radius of
convergence is exactly equal to 1.

    You can use the method of partial fractions you know from calculus. For example, to

find  the  power  series  for  3+   at  0,       write
                               2-1

                     3 +  =  + 1 - 1  =  + (-1)  -   .

     There are different notions of summability (convergence) of a series than just the one we have

3.1 Limits of functions

Note: 2-3 lectures

    Before we define continuity of functions, we visit a somewhat more general notion of a
limit than that of a sequence. Given a function  :   , we want to see how  () behaves
as  tends to a certain point.

3.1.1 Cluster points

First, we return to a concept we have seen previously in an exercise. When moving within
the set , we can only approach points that have elements of  arbitrarily near.

Definition 3.1.1. Let    be a set. A number    is called a cluster point of  if for
every  > 0, the set ( - ,  + )   \ {} is not empty.

    That is,  is a cluster point of  if there are points of  arbitrarily close to . Another way
to phrase the definition is to say that  is a cluster point of  if for every  > 0, there exists
a    such that    and  -  < . Note that a cluster point of  need not lie in .

    Let us see some examples.

   (i) The set {1/ :   } has a unique cluster point zero.

  (ii) The cluster points of the open interval (0, 1) are all points in the closed interval [0, 1].

(iii) The set of cluster points of  is the whole real line .
(iv) The set of cluster points of [0, 1)  {2} is the interval [0, 1].

(v) The set  has no cluster points in .

Proposition 3.1.2. Let   . Then    is a cluster point of  if and only if there exists a
                                      }
convergent  sequence  of  numbers  {        such that        and        for all , and  lim    =  .
                                        =1                                             
114                                                   CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

Proof. First suppose  is a cluster point of . For every   , pick  to be an arbitrary
point of ( - 1/,  + 1/)   \ {}, which is nonempty because  is a cluster point of .
Then  is within 1/ of , that is, | - | < 1/.

As  {1/}        converges  to  zero,  {   }       converges  to  .            {   }

            =1                                =1                     numbers          =1      
    On  the     other  hand,  if  we  start  with  a  sequence   of                       in    converging

to  such that    for all , then for every  > 0 there is an  such that, in particular,
| - | < . That is,   ( - ,  + )   \ {}.
                                                                                                

3.1.2 Limits of functions

If a function  is defined on a set  and  is a cluster point of , then we define the limit of
 () as  approaches . It is irrelevant for the definition whether  is defined at  or not.
Even if the function is defined at , the limit of the function as  goes to  can very well be
different from  ().

Definition 3.1.3. Let  :    be a function and  a cluster point of   . Suppose there
exists an    and for every  > 0, there exists a  > 0 such that whenever    \ {} and
| - | < , we have

                                                    () -  < .

We then say  () converges to  as  goes to , and we write

                                       ()   as   .

We say  is a limit of  () as  goes to , and if  is unique (it is), we write

                                                  lim  () .

                                                                    

If no such  exists, then we say that the limit does not exist or that  diverges at .

    Again the notation and language we are using above assumes the limit , if it exists, is
unique, which needs to be proved. Note that the fact that  is a cluster point is important
to prove uniqueness.

Proposition 3.1.4. Let  be a cluster point of    and let  :    be a function such that
 () converges as  goes to . Then the limit of  () as  goes to  is unique.

Proof. Let 1 and 2 be two numbers that both satisfy the definition. Take an  > 0 and
find a 1 > 0 such that  () - 1 < /2 for all    \ {} with | - | < 1. Also find
2 > 0 such that  () - 2 < /2 for all    \ {} with | - | < 2. Put  min{1, 2}.
Suppose   , | - | < , and   . As  > 0 and  is a cluster point, such an  exists.

Then

        |1 - 2| = 1 -  () +  () - 2  1 -  () +  () - 2 <  +  = .
                                                                                          22

As |1 - 2| <  for arbitrary  > 0, then 1 = 2.                                                   
3.1. LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS                                                      115

Example 3.1.5: Consider  :    defined by  () 2. Then for any   ,

                          lim  () = lim 2 = 2.
                            

Proof: Let    be fixed, and suppose  > 0 is given. Write

                           min 1,  2 || + 1 .

Take    such that | - | < . In particular, | - | < 1. By reverse triangle inequality,

                          || - ||  | - | < 1.

Adding 2 || to both sides, we obtain || + || < 2 || + 1. Estimate

                                      () - 2 = 2 - 2
                                                  = |( + )( - )|
                                                  = | + | | - |
                                                   (|| + ||) | - |
                                                  < (2 || + 1) | - |
                                                  < (2 || + 1)  2 || + 1 = .

Example 3.1.6: Define  : [0, 1)   by

                                              ()  if  > 0,
                                                         1 if  = 0.

Then lim  () = 0, even though  (0) = 1. See Figure 3.1.

 Proof: Let  > 0 be given. Let  . For   [0, 1),   0, and | - 0| < , we get
                                           () - 0 = || <  = .

3.1.3 Sequential limits

Let us connect the limit as defined above with limits of sequences.

Lemma 3.1.7. Let   , let  be a cluster point of , let  :    be a function, and let   .
                                                                        {   }
Then     ()        as        if  and  only  if  for  every  sequence                such  that           \  {}  for
                                                                                =1  
all , and such that lim  = , we have that the sequence  () =1 converges to .

Proof.  Suppose   ()      as          ,  and    {    }      is a sequence such that                \ {} and

                                                       =1
                                                     
lim  = . We wish to show that  () =1 converges to . Let  > 0 be given. Find
a  > 0 such that if    \ {} and | - | < , then               () -             <     .      {   }
                                                                                       As              converges
                                                                                                   =1
to , find an  such that for   , we have that | - | < . Therefore, for   ,

                                             () -  < .

Thus  () =1  converges to .
    For the other direction, we use proof by contrapositive. Suppose it is not true that

 ()   as   . The negation of the definition is that there exists an  > 0 such that for

every  > 0 there exists an    \ {}, where | - | <  and  () -   .
Let us use 1/ for  in the statement above to construct a sequence {}=1. We have
that there exists an  > 0 such that for every , there exists a point    \ {}, where
| - | < 1/ and      () -                                    {   }
                                   .  The   sequence                    just  constructed       converges   to  ,
                                                                    =1
but the sequence  () =1 does not converge to . And we are done.
                                                                                                                

    It is possible to strengthen the reverse direction of the lemma by simply stating that

                

"  () =1 converges," without requiring a specific limit. See Exercise 3.1.11.

Example 3.1.8: lim sin(1/) does not exist, but lim  sin(1/) = 0. See Figure 3.2.
                 0                                   0

Figure 3.2: Graphs of sin(1/) and  sin(1/). Note that the computer cannot properly graph
sin(1/) near zero as it oscillates too fast.
3.1. LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS                                                                                   117

    Proof: We start with sin(1/). Define a sequence by                       1     It  is  not   hard  to  see
that lim  = 0. Furthermore,
                                                                         +/2 .

                                 sin(1/) = sin( + /2) = (-1) .

Therefore,    sin(1/ )                                   By Lemma 3.1.7, lim sin(1/) does not exist.
                                                                         0
                        =1 does not converge.
                                      {   }
Now     consider       sin(1/).  Let              be  a  sequence  such  that      0   for  all  ,  and  such
                                              =1
that lim  = 0. Notice that |sin()|  1 for all   . Therefore,

                        | sin(1/) - 0| = || |sin(1/)|  || .

As  goes to 0, then || goes to zero, and hence              sin(1/)                                        By
Lemma 3.1.7, lim  sin(1/) = 0.
                                                                         =1 converges to zero.
                         0

Keep in mind the phrase "for every sequence" in the lemma. For example, take sin(1/)
                                                                   
and the sequence given by             1/. Then           sin(1/ )
                                                                   =1 is the constant zero sequence,
and therefore converges to zero, but the limit of sin(1/) as   0 does not exist.

Using Lemma 3.1.7, we can start applying everything we know about sequential limits

to limits of functions. Let us give a few important examples.

Corollary 3.1.9. Let    and let  be a cluster point of . Suppose  :    and  :   
are functions such that the limits of  () and () as  goes to  both exist, and

                                  ()  () for all    \ {}.

Then

                                      lim  ()  lim ().
                                                         

Proof.  Take  {  }      be a sequence of numbers in  \ {} that converges to                 .  Let

                   =1

                        1 lim  (), and 2 lim ().
                                                                   

Lemma 3.1.7 says that  () =1  converges to 1 and () =1  converges to 2. We also
have  ()  () for all . We obtain 1  2 using Lemma 2.2.3.                                                   

    By applying constant functions, we get the following corollary. The proof is left as an
exercise.

Corollary 3.1.10. Let    and let  be a cluster point of . Suppose  :    is a function
such that the limit of  () as  goes to  exists. Suppose there are two real numbers  and  such
that

                                       ()   for all    \ {}.

Then

                                        lim  ()  .

                                             
118                                           CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

    Using Lemma 3.1.7 in the same way as above, we also get the following corollaries,
whose proofs are again left as exercises.

Corollary 3.1.11. Let    and let  be a cluster point of . Suppose  :   ,  :   ,
and  :    are functions such that

        ()  ()  () for all    \ {}.

Suppose the limits of  () and () as  goes to  both exist, and

           lim  () = lim ().
                                              

Then the limit of () as  goes to  exists and

         lim () = lim  () = lim ().
                                                

Corollary 3.1.12. Let    and let  be a cluster point of . Suppose  :    and  :   
are functions such that the limits of  () and () as  goes to  both exist. Then

(i) lim  () + () = lim  () + lim () .
             

(ii) lim  () - () = lim  () - lim () .
             

(iii) lim  ()() = lim  () lim () .
           

(iv) If lim ()  0 and ()  0 for all    \ {}, then

           

           lim  () = lim  () .
            () lim ()

Corollary 3.1.13. Let    and let  be a cluster point of . Suppose  :    is a function
such that the limit of  () as  goes to  exists. Then

           lim  () = lim  () .
                                              

3.1.4 Limits of restrictions and one-sided limits

Sometimes we work with the function defined on a subset.

Definition 3.1.14. Let  :    be a function and   . Define the function  | :   
by

                                          |()  () for   .
We call  | the restriction of  to .

    The function  | is simply the function  taken on a smaller domain. The following
proposition is the analogue of taking a tail of a sequence. It says that the limit is "local":
The limit only depends on points arbitrarily near .
3.1. LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS                                                                            119

Proposition 3.1.15. Let   ,   , and let  :    be a function. Suppose    is such
that there is some  > 0 such that ( \ {})  ( - ,  + ) = ( \ {})  ( - ,  + ).

   (i) The point  is a cluster point of  if and only if  is a cluster point of .

  (ii) Supposing  is a cluster point of , then  ()   as    if and only if  |()   as
         .

Proof. First, let  be a cluster point of . Since   , then if ( \ {})  ( - ,  + ) is

nonempty for every  > 0, then ( \ {})  ( - ,  + ) is nonempty for every  > 0. Thus

 is a cluster point of . Second, suppose  is a cluster point of . Then for  > 0 such that

 <  we get that ( \ {})  ( - ,  + ) = ( \ {})  ( - ,  + ), which is nonempty.

This is true for all  <  and hence ( \ {})  ( - ,  + ) must be nonempty for all  > 0.

Thus  is a cluster point of .

Now suppose  is a cluster point of  and  ()   as   . That is, for every  > 0

there is a  > 0 such that if    \ {} and | - | < , then  () -  < . Because   ,

if    \ {}, then    \ {}, and hence  |()   as   .
    Finally, suppose  |()   as    and let  > 0 be given. There is a  > 0 such that

if    \ {} and | - | < , then  |() -  < . Take  min{, }. Now suppose
   \ {} and | - | < . As | - | < , we find    \ {}, and as | - | < , we get

 () -  =  |() -  < .                                                                                

The hypothesis on  in the proposition is necessary. For an arbitrary restriction we

generally get an implication in only one direction, see Exercise 3.1.6. The usual notation for

the limit is

                               lim  ()   lim  |().

                                         
                               

A common use of restriction with respect to limits, which does not satisfy the hypothesis
in the proposition, is the so-called one-sided limit

Definition 3.1.16. Let  :    be function and let   . If  is a cluster point of   (, )
and the limit of the restriction of  to   (, ) as    exists, define

                               lim  ()   lim  |(,)().

                               +         

Similarly, if  is a cluster point of   (-, ) and the limit of the restriction as    exists,

define

                               lim-  ()  lim  |(-,)().

                                         

    Proposition 3.1.15 does not apply to one-sided limits. It is possible to have one-sided
limits, but no limit at a point. For example, define  :    by  () 1 for  < 0 and
 () 0 for   0. We leave it to the reader to verify that

              lim  () = 1,     lim  () = 0,  lim  () does not exist.

              0-               0+            0

All is not lost, however, for we have the following replacement.

One sees a plethora of one-sided limit notations. E.g., lim  (), lim  (), or lim  () for lim-  ().

Proposition 3.1.17. Let    be such that  is a cluster point of both   (-, ) and   (, ),
let  :    be a function, and let   . Then  is a cluster point of  and

                       lim  () =              if and only if          lim-    () =      lim        () = .
                                                                      
                                                                                               +
                                                                                        

    That is, a limit at  exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. The

proof is a straightforward application of the definition of limit and is left as an exercise.
The key point is that   (-, )    (, ) =  \ {}.

3.2 Continuous functions

Note: 2-2.5 lectures

    A high-school criterion for the concept of continuity is that a function is continuous if
we can draw its graph without lifting the pen from the paper. While that intuitive concept
may be useful in simple situations, we require rigor. The following definition took three
great mathematicians (Bolzano, Cauchy, and finally Weierstrass) to get correctly and its
final form dates only to the late 1800s.

3.2.1 Definition and basic properties

Definition 3.2.1. Suppose    and   . We say  :    is continuous at  if for every
 > 0 there is a  > 0 such that whenever    and | - | < , we have  () -  () < .

    When  :    is continuous at all   , then we simply say  is a continuous function.

                                                                       =  ()
                              ()

                                                  
                                                       

Figure 3.3: For | - | < , the graph of  () should be within the gray region.

    If  is continuous for all   , we say  is continuous on   . A straightforward
exercise (Exercise 3.2.7) shows that this implies that  | is continuous, although the
converse does not hold (as we will see in Example 3.2.13).

    Continuity may be the most important definition to understand in analysis, and it is not
an easy one. See Figure 3.3. Note that  not only depends on , but also on ; we need not
pick one  for all   . It is no accident that the definition of continuity is similar to the

definition of a limit of a function. The main feature of continuous functions is that these

are precisely the functions that behave nicely with limits.

Proposition 3.2.2. Consider a function  :    defined on a set    and let   . Then:

(i) If  is not a cluster point of , then  is continuous at .

(ii) If  is a cluster point of , then  is continuous at  if and only if the limit of  () as   

       exists and

                                                  lim  () =  ().

                                                  

(iii)  The  function    is  continuous  at    if  and  only  if  for  every  sequence  {   }       where      
                                                  
       and lim  = , the sequence  () =1 converges to  ().                                      =1

            
3.2. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS                                                                                      123

Proof. We start with (i). Suppose  is not a cluster point of . Then there exists a  > 0 such

that   ( - ,  + ) = {}. For any  > 0, simply pick this given . The only    such

that | - | <  is  = . Then  () -  () =  () -  () = 0 < .

Let us move to (ii). Suppose  is a cluster point of . Let us first suppose that

lim  () =  (). Then for every  > 0, there is a  > 0 such that if    \ {} and
| - | < , then  () -  () < . Also  () -  () = 0 < , so the definition of continuity

at  is satisfied. On the other hand, suppose  is continuous at . For every  > 0, there

exists a  > 0 such that for    where | - | < , we have  () -  () < . Then the

statement is, of course, still true if    \ {}  . Therefore, lim  () =  ().
                                                                 {   }
For  (iii),  first  suppose    is  continuous        at  .  Let              be  a   sequence  such    that      
                                                                         =1
and lim  = . Let  > 0 be given. Find a  > 0 such that  () -  () <  for all
   where | - | < . Find an    such that for   , we have | - | < . Then

                                                                                                
for   , we have that  () -  () < , so  () =1 converges to  ().
We prove the other direction of (iii) by contrapositive. Suppose  is not continuous

at . Then there exists an  > 0 such that for every  > 0, there exists an    such that
                                                                     {   }
| - | <  and         () -  ()       .  Define        a   sequence                    as  follows.  Let    be
                                                                             =1
such that | - | < 1/ and            () -  ()             .           {   }                             
                                                            Now                  is  a   sequence  in    such  that
                                                                             =1                    
lim  =  and such that  () -  ()   for all   . Thus  () =1 does not
converge to  (). It may or may not converge, but it definitely does not converge to  (). 

    The last item in the proposition is particularly powerful. It allows us to quickly apply
what we know about limits of sequences to continuous functions and even to prove that
certain functions are continuous. It can also be strengthened, see Exercise 3.2.13.

Example 3.2.3: The function  : (0, )   defined by  () 1/ is continuous.

Proof:  Fix         (0,  ).  Let  {   }       be  a  sequence    in  (0,  )  such    that  lim           =  .  Then

                                          =1

                          () = 1 = 1 = lim 1 = lim  ().
                                   lim    

Thus  is continuous at . As  is continuous at all   (0, ),  is continuous.

    We have previously shown lim 2 = 2 directly. Therefore the function 2 is
continuous. The last item of Proposition 3.2.2 and the continuity of algebraic operations
with respect to limits of sequences, Proposition 2.2.5, gives a quick proof of a much more
general result.

Proposition 3.2.4. Let  :    be a polynomial. That is,

                                  () =   + -1-1 + · · · + 1 + 0,

for some constants 0, 1, . . . , . Then  is continuous.
124                                                            CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

Proof.  Fix    .     Let  {   }       be  a  sequence    such           that  lim     =   .   Then

                                  =1

               () =   + -1-1 + · · · + 1 + 0

                                                                        -1
                     =  lim  + -1 lim  + · · · + 1 lim  + 0
                                                                                    

                     = lim             +             -1  +  ·  ·  ·  +  1     +  0  = lim  ().
                                                                                    
                                             -1  

Thus  is continuous at . As  is continuous at all   ,  is continuous.                                             

    By similar reasoning, or by appealing to Corollary 3.1.12, we can prove the following
proposition. The proof is left as an exercise.

Proposition 3.2.5. Let  :    and  :    be functions continuous at   .
   (i) The function  :    defined by ()  () + () is continuous at .
  (ii) The function  :    defined by ()  () - () is continuous at .

 (iii) The function  :    defined by ()  ()() is continuous at .
 (iv) If ()  0 for all   , the function  :    given by () ()  () is continuous at .

Example 3.2.6: The functions sin() and cos() are continuous. In the following computa-

tions we use the sum-to-product trigonometric identities. We also use the simple facts that
|sin()|  ||, |cos()|  1, and |sin()|  1.

3.2.2 Composition of continuous functions

You probably already realized that one of the basic tools in constructing complicated
functions out of simple ones is composition. Recall that for two functions  and , the
composition    is defined by (   )()  () . A composition of continuous functions
is again continuous.

Proposition 3.2.7. Let ,    and  :    and  :    be functions. If  is continuous
at    and  is continuous at (), then    :    is continuous at .

Proof.  Let  {   }       be a sequence in      such that lim             =  .    As       is continuous at    ,
                                                                                                         
                     =1
               
we have () =1 converges to (). As  is continuous at (), we have  () =1
converges to  () . Thus    is continuous at .
                                                                                                              

Example 3.2.8: Claim: sin(1/) 2 is a continuous function on (0, ).
    Proof: The function 1/ is continuous on (0, ) and sin() is continuous on (0, )

(actually on , but (0, ) is the range for 1/). Hence the composition sin(1/) is continuous.
Also, 2 is continuous on the interval [-1, 1] (the range of sin). Thus the composition
 sin(1/) 2 is continuous on (0, ).

3.2.3 Discontinuous functions

When  is not continuous at , we say  is discontinuous at , or that it has a discontinuity
at . The following proposition is a useful test and follows immediately from third item of

Proposition 3.2.2.

Proposition 3.2.9. Let  :    be a function and   . Suppose there exists a sequence
                                                                         
{}=1,    for all , and lim  =  such that  () =1 does not converge to  ().
Then  is discontinuous at .

    Again, saying that  () =1  does not converge to  () means that it either does not
converge at all, or it converges to something other than  ().

Example 3.2.10: The function  :    defined by

                                        () -1 if  < 0,
                                                  1 if   0

is not continuous at 0.
                         {-1/} ,
Proof:       Consider                  which  converges  to  0.  Then     (-1/)  =  -1    for  every  ,  and  so
                                   =1
lim  (-1/) = -1, but  (0) = 1. Thus the function is not continuous at 0. See Figure 3.4.
Notice that  (1/) = 1 for all   . Hence, lim  (1/) =  (0) = 1. So  () =1 
may  converge  to   (0)  for  some     specific  sequence    {   }       going  to  0,  despite  the  function

being discontinuous at 0.                                            =1

                         (-1)          
Finally, consider   = (-1) . This sequence diverges.

  Figure 3.4: Jump discontinuity. The values of  (-1/) and  (0) are marked as black dots.

Example 3.2.11: For an extreme example, take the so-called Dirichlet function.

                                     () 1 if  is rational,
                                               0 if  is irrational.

The function  is discontinuous at all   .                 {   }

      Proof:  If     is  rational,  take     a  sequence          =1  of  irrational    numbers        such   that

lim  =  (why can we?). Then  () = 0 and so lim  () = 0, but  () = 1. If
                                                                   {   }
  is  irrational,  take  a  sequence  of  rational  numbers                    that  converges   to    (why   can
                                                                           =1
we?). Then lim  () = 1, but  () = 0.

    Let us test the limits of our intuition. Can there exist a function continuous at all

irrational numbers, but discontinuous at all rational numbers? There are rational numbers

arbitrarily close to any irrational number. Perhaps strangely, the answer is yes, such a
function exists. The following example is called the Thomae function or the popcorn function.

Example 3.2.12: Define  : (0, 1)   as

   () 1/ if  = /, where ,    and have no common divisors (lowest terms),
             0 if  is irrational.

See the graph of  in Figure 3.5. We claim that  is continuous at all irrational  and

discontinuous at all rational .

      Proof: Let  = / be rational and in lowest terms. Take a sequence of irrational numbers
{   }
            such  that   lim        =  .     Then   lim          ()   =  lim 0       =  0,  but   ()   =  1/    0.
        =1
So  is discontinuous at .
                                                                               {   }
      Now let  be irrational, so  () = 0.                 Take  a  sequence                in  (0, 1)  such   that
                                                                                       =1
lim  = . Given  > 0, find    such that 1/ <  by the Archimedean property. If
/  (0, 1) and ,   , then 0 <  < . So there are only finitely many rational numbers

in (0, 1) whose denominator  in lowest terms is less than . As lim  = , every
number not equal to  can appear at most finitely many times in {}=1. Hence, there is

an  such that for   , all the numbers  that are rational have a denominator larger
than or equal to . Thus for   ,

                                          () - 0 =  ()  1/ < .

Therefore,  is continuous at irrational .

    Let us end on an easier example.

Example 3.2.13: Define  :    by () 0 if   0 and (0) 1. Then  is not
continuous at zero, but continuous everywhere else (why?). The point  = 0 is called a
removable discontinuity. That is because if we would change the definition of , by insisting
that (0) be 0, we would obtain a continuous function. On the other hand, let  be the
function of Example 3.2.10. Then  does not have a removable discontinuity at 0. No matter
how we would define  (0) the function would still fail to be continuous. The difference is
that lim0 () exists while lim0  () does not.

    We stay with this example to show another phenomenon. Let  {0}, then | is
continuous (why?), while  is not continuous on . Similarly, if   \ {0}, then | is
also continuous, and  is in fact continuous on .

3.3 Extreme and intermediate value theorems

Note: 1.5 lectures
    Continuous functions on closed and bounded intervals are quite well behaved.

3.3.1 Min-max or extreme value theorem

Recall that  : [, ]   is bounded if there exists a    such that  ()   for all
  [, ]. For a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval, we have the
following lemma.

Lemma 3.3.1. A continuous function  : [, ]   is bounded.

Proof. We prove the claim by contrapositive. Suppose  is not bounded. Then for each
  , there is an   [, ], such that

                                                 ()  .

The  sequence  {   }       is bounded as                      .  By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem,
                                                }
                       =1              {                 Let     lim  . Since      for all ,
there  is  a  convergent  subsequence             =1  .
                                              

then     . The sequence  ( ) =1 is not bounded as  ( )    . Thus  is not
continuous at  as

                () =  lim  , but lim  ( ) does not exist.                         
                                                              

    Notice a key point of the proof. Boundedness of [, ] allows us to use Bolzano-
Weierstrass, while the fact that it is closed gives us that the limit is back in [, ]. The

technique is a common one: Find a sequence with a certain property, then use Bolzano-

Weierstrass to make such a sequence that also converges.
    Recall from calculus that  :    achieves an absolute minimum at    if

                              ()   () for all   .

On the other hand,  achieves an absolute maximum at    if

                              ()   () for all   .

If such a    exists, then we say  achieves an absolute minimum (resp. absolute maximum) on
, and we call  () the absolute minimum (resp. absolute maximum).

    If  is a closed and bounded interval, then a continuous  is not just bounded, it must
achieve an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum on .

Theorem 3.3.2 (Minimum-maximum theorem / Extreme value theorem). A continuous
function  : [, ]   achieves both an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum on [, ].

    Again, we remark that is important that the domain of  is a closed and bounded
interval [, ].
3.3. EXTREME AND INTERMEDIATE VALUE THEOREMS                                                                      131

                 absolute maximum of = ( )

                        absolute minimum of = ( )

    Figure 3.6:  : [, ]   achieves an absolute maximum  () at , and an absolute minimum
     () at .

Proof. The lemma says that  is bounded, so the set  [, ] =  () :   [, ] has
a supremum and an infimum. There exist sequences in the set  [, ] that approach
its supremum and its infimum. That is, there are sequences  () =1  and  () =1  ,
where  and  are in [, ], such that

                 lim  () = inf  [, ]            and lim  () = sup  [, ] .

                                                                

We are not done yet; we need to find where the minima and the maxima are. The problem
                          {   }            {  }                                                {   }
is  that  the  sequences              and              need  not  converge.    We     know                        and
{  }                              =1               =1                                                  =1
            are  bounded  (their  elements      belong  to   a  bounded  interval     [, ]).      Apply the
        =1                                                                                                 
Bolzano-Weierstrass  theorem          to  find  convergent  subsequences  {        }  =1  and  {        }  =1  .  Let
                                                                                                      

                           lim  and  lim  .
                                                                  

As      for all , we have     . Similarly,     . So  and  are in [, ]. A
limit of a subsequence is the same as the limit of the sequence, and we can take a limit past
the continuous function  :

                 inf  [, ] = lim  () = lim  ( ) =  lim  =  ().
                                                                  

Similarly,

                 sup  [, ] = lim  () = lim  ( ) =  lim  =  ().
                                                                  

Hence,  achieves an absolute minimum at  and an absolute maximum at .                                             

Example 3.3.3: The function  () 2 + 1 defined on the interval [-1, 2] achieves a
minimum at  = 0 when  (0) = 1. It achieves a maximum at  = 2 where  (2) = 5. Do note
that the domain of definition matters. If we instead took the domain to be [-10, 10], then 
would no longer have a maximum at  = 2. Instead, the maximum would be achieved at
either  = 10 or  = -10.

    We show by examples that the different hypotheses of the theorem are truly needed.

Example 3.3.4: The function  :    defined by  ()  achieves neither a minimum,
nor a maximum. So it is important that we are looking at a bounded interval.

Example 3.3.5: The function  : (0, 1)   defined by  () 1/ achieves neither a
minimum, nor a maximum. It is continuous, but (0, 1) is not closed. The values of the
function are unbounded as we approach 0. Also as we approach  = 1, the values of the
function approach 1, but  () > 1 for all   (0, 1). There is no   (0, 1) such that  () = 1.
So it is important that we are looking at a closed interval.

Example 3.3.6: Continuity is important. Define  : [0, 1]   by  () 1/ for  > 0 and
let  (0) 0. The function does not achieve a maximum. The domain [0, 1] is closed and
bounded, but the problem is that the function is not continuous at 0.

3.3.2 Bolzano's intermediate value theorem

Bolzano's intermediate value theorem is one of the cornerstones of analysis. It is sometimes
only called the intermediate value theorem, or just Bolzano's theorem. To prove Bolzano's
theorem we prove the following simpler lemma.

Lemma 3.3.7. Let  : [, ]   be a continuous function. Suppose  () < 0 and  () > 0.
Then there exists a number   (, ) such that  () = 0.

Proof.  We  define  two  sequences  {   }       and  {  }        inductively:

                                            =1               =1

(i) Let 1  and 1 .

(ii) If      +       0, let +1       and +1          2 + .
               2

(iii) If  2 + < 0, let +1 2 + and +1 .

See Figure 3.7 for an example defining the first five steps.     If    <       , then    <   +    <  .
                                                                                               2
So +1 < +1. Thus by induction  <  for all . Furthermore,   +1 and
  +1 for all , that is, the sequences are monotone. As  <   1 =  and
 >   1 =  for all , the sequences are also bounded. Therefore, the sequences
converge. Let  lim  and  lim , where also       . We need to

show that  = . Notice               +1 - +1 =  -  .
                                                          2

By induction,             -  = 2-1 1 - 1 = 21-( - ).

As 21-( - ) converges to zero, we take the limit as  goes to infinity to get

                          -  = lim ( - ) = lim 21-( - ) = 0.
                                                     

In other words,  = .

Figure 3.7: Finding roots (bisection method).

By construction, for all ,

                             () < 0 and  ()  0.

Since lim  = lim  =  and  is continuous at , we may take limits in those

inequalities:

                () = lim  ()  0 and  () = lim  ()  0.
                                                  

As  ()  0 and  ()  0, we conclude  () = 0. Thus also    and   , so  <  < . 

Theorem 3.3.8 (Bolzano's intermediate value theorem). Let  : [, ]   be a continuous
function. Suppose    is such that  () <  <  () or  () >  >  (). Then there exists a
  (, ) such that  () = .

    The theorem says that a continuous function on a closed interval achieves all the values
between the values at the endpoints.

Proof. If  () <  <  (), then define ()  () - . Then () < 0 and () > 0, and we

apply Lemma 3.3.7 to  to find . If () = 0, then  () = .

Similarly, if  () >  >  (), then define ()  -  (). Again, () < 0 and () > 0,

and we apply Lemma 3.3.7 to find . As before, if () = 0, then  () = .  

    If a function is continuous, then the restriction to a subset is continuous; if  :    is
continuous and [, ]  , then  |[,] is also continuous. We generally apply the theorem
to a function continuous on some large set , but we restrict our attention to an interval.

    The proof of the lemma tells us how to find the root . The proof is not only useful for

us pure mathematicians, it is a useful idea in applied mathematics, where it is called the

bisection method.
134                        CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

Example 3.3.9 (Bisection method): The polynomial  () 3 - 22 +  - 1 has a real root
in (1, 2). We simply notice that  (1) = -1 and  (2) = 1. Hence there must exist a point
  (1, 2) such that  () = 0. To find a better approximation of the root we follow the proof
of Lemma 3.3.7. We look at 1.5 and find that  (1.5) = -0.625. Therefore, there is a root
of the polynomial in (1.5, 2). Next we look at 1.75 and note that  (1.75)  -0.016. Hence
there is a root of  in (1.75, 2). Next we look at 1.875 and find that  (1.875)  0.44, thus
there is a root in (1.75, 1.875). We follow this procedure until we gain sufficient precision.
In fact, the root is at   1.7549.

    The technique is the simplest method of finding roots of polynomials, a common
problem in applied mathematics. In general, finding roots is hard to do quickly, precisely,
and automatically. There are other, faster methods of finding roots of polynomials, such as
Newton's method. One advantage of the method above is its simplicity. The moment we
find an interval where the intermediate value theorem applies, we are guaranteed to find a
root up to a desired precision in finitely many steps. Furthermore, the bisection method
finds roots of any continuous function, not just a polynomial.

    The theorem guarantees one  such that  () = , but there may be other roots of the
equation  () = . If we follow the procedure of the proof, we are guaranteed to find
approximations to one such root. We need to work harder to find any other roots.

    Polynomials of even degree may not have any real roots. There is no real number  such
that 2 + 1 = 0. Odd polynomials, on the other hand, always have at least one real root.

Proposition 3.3.10. Let  () be a polynomial of odd degree. Then  has a real root.

Proof. Suppose  is a polynomial of odd degree . We write
                                  () =   + -1-1 + · · · + 1 + 0,

where   0. We divide by  to obtain a monic polynomial
                                  ()  + -1-1 + · · · + 1 + 0,

where  = /. Let us show that () is positive for some large   . We first compare
the highest order term with the rest:

     -1-1 + · · · + 1 + 0  = -1-1 + · · · + 1 + 0
                                             

                            |-1| -1 + · · · + |1|  + |0|
                                                

                            |-1| -1 + · · · + |1| -1 + |0| -1
                                                     

                           = -1 |-1| + · · · + |1| + |0|
                                               

                           = 1 |-1| + · · · + |1| + |0| .

The word monic means that the coefficient of  is 1.
3.3. EXTREME AND INTERMEDIATE VALUE THEOREMS      135

Therefore,     lim -1-1 + · · · + 1 + 0 = 0.

                                      

Thus there exists an    such that

               -1 < 1 -1 + · · · + 1 + 0 ,
                              

which implies  -(-1-1 + · · · + 1 + 0) < .

Therefore, () > 0.
    Next, consider (-) for   . By a similar argument, there exists a    such that

-1(-)-1 + · · · + 1(-) + 0 <  and therefore (-) < 0 (see Exercise 3.3.5). In the
proof, make sure you use the fact that  is odd. In particular, if  is odd, then (-) = -().

    We appeal to the intermediate value theorem to find a   (-, ), such that () = 0.
As () =   () , then  () = 0, and the proof is done. 

                                                                                                                  
Example 3.3.11: You may recall how hard we worked in Example 1.2.3 to show that 2

exists. With Bolzano's theorem, we can prove the existence th root of any positive number
 > 0 without any effort. We claim that for any    and any  > 0, there exists a number
 > 0 such that  = .

    Proof: If  = 1, then it is clear, so assume   1. Let  ()  - . We notice
 (0) = - < 0. If  < 1, then  (1) = 1 -  > 0. If  > 1, then  () =  -  = (-1 -1) > 0.
In either case, apply Bolzano's theorem to find an  > 0 such that  () = 0, or in other
words  = .

Example 3.3.12: Interestingly, there exist discontinuous functions with the intermediate
value property. The function

                () sin(1/) if   0,
                                   0    if  = 0,

is not continuous at 0; however,  has the intermediate value property: Whenever  < 
and  is such that  () <  <  () or  () >  >  (), there exists a   (, ) such that
 () = . See Figure 3.2 for a graph of sin(1/). Proof is left as Exercise 3.3.4.

    The intermediate value theorem says that if  : [, ]   is continuous, then  [, ]
contains all the values between  () and  (). In fact, more is true. Combining all the
results of this section one can prove the following useful corollary whose proof is left as an
exercise. Hint: See Figure 3.8 and notice what the endpoints of the image interval are.

Corollary 3.3.13. If  : [, ]   is continuous, then the direct image  [, ] is a closed and
bounded interval or a single number.

3.4 Uniform continuity

Note: 1.5-2 lectures (continuous extension can be optional)

3.4.1 Uniform continuity

We made a fuss of saying that the  in the definition of continuity depended on the point
. There are situations when it is advantageous to be able to pick a  independent of any
point, and so we give a name to this concept.

Definition 3.4.1. Let   , and let  :    be a function. Suppose for every  > 0 there
exists a  > 0 such that whenever ,    and | - | < , then  () -  () < . Then we
say  is uniformly continuous.

    A uniformly continuous function must be continuous. The only difference in the
definitions is that in uniform continuity, for a given  > 0 we pick a  > 0 that works for all
  . That is,  can no longer depend on , it only depends on . The domain of definition

of the function makes a difference now. A function that is not uniformly continuous on a
larger set, may be uniformly continuous when restricted to a smaller set. Note that  and 

are not treated any differently in this definition.

Example 3.4.2:  : [0, 1]   defined by  ()    2 is uniformly continuous.
    Proof: Note that 0  ,   1. Then

     |2 - 2| = | + || - |  || + || | - |  (1 + 1)| - |.

Therefore, given  > 0, let  /2. If | - | < , then |2 - 2|  2| - | < .

    On the other hand,  :    defined by () 2 is not uniformly continuous.

    Proof: Suppose it is uniformly continuous, then for every  > 0, there would exist a
 > 0 such that if | - | < , then |2 - 2| < . Take  > 0 and let   + /2. Write

      > |2 - 2| = | + || - | = (2 + /2)/2  .

Therefore,  < / for all  > 0, which is a contradiction.

Example 3.4.3: The function  : (0, 1)   defined by  () 1/ is not uniformly continu-

ous.
    Proof: Given  > 0, then  > |1/ - 1/| holds if and only if

      > |1/ - 1/| =  -  =  -  ,
                                                             

or
                                                   -  < .

Suppose  < 1, and we wish to see if a small  > 0 would work. If   (0, 1) and
 =  + /2  (0, 1), then  -  = /2 < . We plug  into the inequality above to get
/2 <   + /2  < . If the definition of uniform continuity is satisfied, then the inequality
/2 <  holds for all  > 0. But then   0. Therefore, no single  > 0 works for all points.
3.4. UNIFORM CONTINUITY                                                                                           139

    The examples show that if  is defined on an interval that is either not closed or not
bounded, then  can be continuous, but not uniformly continuous. For a closed and
bounded interval [, ], we can, however, make the following statement.

Theorem 3.4.4. Let  : [, ]   be a continuous function. Then  is uniformly continuous.

Proof. We prove the statement by contrapositive. Suppose  is not uniformly continuous.

We will prove that there is some   [, ] where  is not continuous. Let us negate the

definition of uniformly continuous. There exists an  > 0 such that for every  > 0, there

exist points ,  in [, ] with  -  <  and  () -  ()  .
                                                            {   }            {  }
So  for   the     >   0   above,  we    find     sequences              and               such    that   -   < 1/
                                                                    =1               =1
and such that  () -  ()  . By Bolzano-Weierstrass, there exists a convergent
               {        }                     lim  . As      for all , we have     .
subsequence                   .  Let  
                          =1
Estimate

          | - | = | -  +  - |  | -  | + | - | < 1/ + | - |.

As 1/ and   -             both    go    to  zero   when     goes  to    infinity,  {        }     converges  and  the

limit is . We now show that  is not continuous at . Estimate                                  =1

                           () -  () =  () -  () +  () -  ()
                                              () -  () -  () -  ()
                                              -  () -  () .

Or in other words,

                                       () -  () +  () -  ()  .

At least one of the sequences  ( ) =1  or  ( ) =1  cannot converge to  (), otherwise
the left-hand side of the inequality would go to zero while the right-hand side is positive.

Thus  cannot be continuous at .                                                                                          

    As before, note what is key in the proof: We can apply Bolzano-Weierstrass because
the interval [, ] is bounded, and the limit of the subsequence is back in [, ] because the

interval is closed.

3.4.2 Continuous extension

Uniformly continuous functions on open intervals extend continuously to the endpoints.
The key is the following lemma, which also has many other uses. It says that uniformly
continuous functions preserve Cauchy sequences. The new issue here is that for a Cauchy
sequence, the limit may not end up in the domain of the function.

Lemma  3.4.5.  Let               and  let     :        be   a  uniformly  continuous        function.   Let  {   }       be
                                                   
a Cauchy sequence in . Then  () =1 is Cauchy.                                                                        =1
140                                          CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

Proof. Let  > 0 be given. There is a  > 0 such that  () -  () <  whenever ,   

and  -  < . Find an    such that for all ,   , we have | - | < . Then for
all ,   , we have  () -  () < .
                                                                                           

    An application of the lemma above is the following extension result. It says that a
function on an open interval is uniformly continuous if and only if it can be extended to a
continuous function on the closed interval.

Proposition 3.4.6. A function  : (, )   is uniformly continuous if and only if the limits

                   lim  () and  lim  ()
                                                        

exist and the function  : [, ]   defined by

                                        () if   (, ),
                                 
                         ()                  if  = ,
                                       if  = 

is continuous.

Proof. One direction is quick. If  is continuous, then it is uniformly continuous by

Theorem 3.4.4. As  is the restriction of  to (, ),  is also uniformly continuous (exercise).

    Now suppose  is uniformly continuous. We must first show that the limits  and
                                            {   }       in (, ) such that lim 
    exist.  Let us concentrate on  .  Take                                       =  .  The
                                                    =1
sequence {}=1 is Cauchy, so by Lemma 3.4.5 the sequence  () =1 is Cauchy and

thus convergent. Let 1  lim            ().  Take  another  sequence  {  }        in (, ) such

                                                                             =1
that lim  = . By the same reasoning we get 2 lim  (). If we show that
1 = 2, then the limit  = lim  () exists. Let  > 0 be given. Find  > 0 such
that  -  <  implies  () -  () < /3. Find    such that for   , we have

| - | < /2,  -  < /2,  () - 1 < /3, and  () - 2 < /3. Then for   ,

                 -  =  -  +  -   | - | +  -  < /2 + /2 = .

So

                  |1 - 2| = 1 -  () +  () -  () +  () - 2

                         1 -  () +  () -  () +  () - 2
                         /3 + /3 + /3 = .

Therefore, 1 = 2. Thus  exists. To show that  exists is left as an exercise.
    If  = lim  () exists, then lim  () exists and equals  (see Proposition 3.1.15).

Similarly for . Hence  is continuous at  and . And since  is continuous at   (, ),

then  is continuous at   (, ) (Proposition 3.1.15 again).                                  

    A typical application of this proposition (together with Proposition 3.1.17) is the
following. Suppose  : (-1, 0)  (0, 1)   is uniformly continuous, then lim0  ()

exists and the function has a removable singularity, that is, we can extend the function to a
continuous function on (-1, 1).

3.4.3 Lipschitz continuous functions

Definition 3.4.7. A function  :    is Lipschitz continuous, if there exists a   , such
that

                             () -  ()    -  for all  and  in .

    A large class of functions is Lipschitz continuous. Be careful, just as for uniformly
continuous functions, the domain of definition of the function is important. See the
examples below and the exercises. First, we justify the use of the word continuous.

Proposition 3.4.8. A Lipschitz continuous function is uniformly continuous.

Proof. Let  :    be a function and let  be a constant such that  () -  ()    - 
for all ,  in . Let  > 0 be given. Take  /. For all  and  in  such that  -  < ,

 () -  ()    -  <  =   = .

Therefore,  is uniformly continuous.                                                            

    We interpret Lipschitz continuity geometrically. Let  be a Lipschitz continuous
function with some constant . We rewrite the inequality to say that for   , we have

                                                 () -  ()  -   .

The quantity -  ()-  () is the slope of the line between the points ,  () and ,  () , that
is, a secant line. Therefore,  is Lipschitz continuous if and only if every line that intersects
the graph of  in at least two distinct points has slope in absolute value less than or equal
to . See Figure 3.9.

                         slope = - ( )- ( )

142                                   CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

Example 3.4.9: The functions sin() and cos() are Lipschitz continuous. In Example 3.2.6
we have seen the following two inequalities.

        sin() - sin()   -  and cos() - cos()   -  .

Hence sine and cosine are Lipschitz continuous with  = 1.

Example 3.4.10: The function  : [1, )   defined by  ()  is Lipschitz continuous.

Proof:                                            -

                                  -
        -  =   =   .
                                  +  + 

As   1 and   1, we see that  1    1.  Therefore,
        + 
                                  2

                                  -   1
        -  =    - .
                                  +  2

    On the other hand,  : [0, )   defined by ()            is not Lipschitz continuous.
Proof: Suppose for all ,   [0, ),

                                              -     -  ,

for some . Set  = 0 to obtain   . If  > 0, then for  > 0 we get 1/   or
1/2  . This cannot possibly be true for all  > 0. Thus no such  > 0 exists and  is not

Lipschitz continuous. See Figure 3.10 and note how secant lines would be more and more
vertical as we get closer to  = 0.

  Figure 3.10: Graph of  and some secant lines through (0, 0) and (, ).

    The last example  is a function that is uniformly continuous but not Lipschitz
                               

continuous. To see that  is uniformly continuous as a function on [0, ), note that it is
uniformly continuous when restricted to [0, 1] by Theorem 3.4.4. It is also Lipschitz (and
so uniformly continuous) when restricted to [1, ). It is not hard (exercise) to show that

                     
this means that  is a uniformly continuous function on [0, ).

3.5 Limits at infinity

Note: less than 1 lecture (optional, can safely be omitted unless §3.6 or §5.5 is also covered)

3.5.1 Limits at infinity

As for sequences, a continuous variable can also approach infinity.

Definition 3.5.1. We say  is a cluster point of    if for every   , there exists an
   such that   . Similarly, - is a cluster point of    if for every   , there
exists an    such that   .

    Let  :    be a function, where  is a cluster point of . If there exists an   
such that for every  > 0, there is an    such that

                                                 () -  < 

whenever    and   , then we say  () converges to  as  goes to . We call  the

limit and write

                                              lim  () .

                                              

Alternatively we write  ()   as   .
    Similarly, if - is a cluster point of  and there exists an    such that for every  > 0,

there is an    such that
                                                    () -  < 

whenever    and   , then we say  () converges to  as  goes to -. Alternatively,
we write  ()   as   -. We call  a limit and, if unique, write

                                               lim  () .

                                              -

    The first thing to do, as usual, is to prove that the limit, if it exists, is unique. We leave it
as an exercise for the reader.

Proposition 3.5.2. The limit at  or - as defined above is unique if it exists.

Example 3.5.3: Let  ()              1 . Then

                                  ||+1

                               lim  () = 0 and                  lim  () = 0.

                                                               -

      Proof:  Let    >  0  be  given.  Find     >    0  large  enough  so  that    1  <  .   If       ,  then
                                                                                 +1
0  <    1   =   1      1   <   .  The  first  limit  follows.  The  proof  for  -  is  left  to  the  reader.
      ||+1     +1    +1

Example 3.5.4: Let  () sin(). Then lim  () does not exist. To prove this fact
note that if  = 2 + 1/2 for some   , then  () = 1, while if  = 2 + 3/2, then  () = -1.
So they cannot both be within a small  of a single real number.
146                                                       CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

     Be careful not to confuse continuous limits with limits of sequences. We could say

                     lim sin() = 0, but lim sin() does not exist.
                                                          

Of course the notation is ambiguous: Are we thinking of the sequence sin() =1  or the
function sin() of a real variable? We are simply using the convention that   , while
  . When the notation is not clear, it is good to explicitly mention where the variable

lives, or what kind of limit are you using. If there is possibility of confusion, one can write,

for example,
                                                   lim sin().

                                                                     
                                                                  

    There is a connection of continuous limits to limits of sequences, but we must take all
sequences going to infinity, just as before in Lemma 3.1.7.

Lemma 3.5.5. Suppose  :    is a function,  is a cluster point of   , and   . Then

                        lim  () =             if and only if     lim  () = 

                                                                 

for  all  sequences  {  }     in   such that  lim    = .
                                              
                          =1

     The lemma also holds for the limit as   -. Its proof is almost identical and is left

as an exercise.

Proof. First suppose  ()   as   . Given an  > 0, there exists an  such that for
                                              {   }
all   , we have          () -      <  .  Let              be  a  sequence  in    such  that  lim    =  .
                                                      =1
Then there exists an  such that for all   , we have   . And thus  () -  < .
     We prove the converse by contrapositive. Suppose  () does not go to  as   . This

means that there exists an  > 0, such that for every   , there exists an   ,   , let
                                                                                                    
us call it , such that  () -   . Consider the sequence {}=1. Clearly  () =1
does not converge to . It remains to note that lim  = , because    for all . 

    Using the lemma, we again translate results about sequential limits into results about
continuous limits as  goes to infinity. That is, we have almost immediate analogues of the
corollaries in §3.1.3. We simply allow the cluster point  to be either  or -, in addition

to a real number. We leave it to the student to verify these statements.

3.5.2 Infinite limit

Just as for sequences, it is often convenient to distinguish certain divergent sequences, and
talk about limits being infinite almost as if the limits existed.

Definition 3.5.6. Let  :    be a function and suppose  has  as a cluster point. We
say  () diverges to infinity as  goes to  if for every    there exists an    such that

                                                      () > 
3.5. LIMITS AT INFINITY                                                 147

whenever    and   . We write

                                                 lim  () ,

                                                                   

or we say that  ()   as   .

    A similar definition can be made for limits as   - or as    for a finite . Also
similar definitions can be made for limits being -. Stating these definitions is left as an

exercise. Note that sometimes converges to infinity is used. We can again use sequential

limits, and an analogue of Lemma 3.1.7 is left as an exercise.

Example 3.5.7:  Let us show that  lim  1+2  = .
                                       1+

Proof: For   1, we have           1 + 2 1 +   2  +  = 2 .

Given   , take  = max{2 + 1, 1}. If   , then   1 and /2 > . So

                                  1 + 2 1 +   2 >  .

3.5.3 Compositions

Finally, just as for limits at finite numbers we can compose functions easily.

Proposition 3.5.8. Suppose  :   ,  :   , ,   ,     {-, } is a cluster
point of , and     {-, } is a cluster point of . Suppose

                    lim  () =  and lim () = 
                                                 

for some     {-, }. If   , then suppose () = . Then

                                                lim   () = .

                                                                  

    The proof is straightforward, and left as an exercise. We already know the proposition
when , ,   , see Exercises 3.1.9 and 3.1.14. Again the requirement that  is continuous
at , if   , is necessary.

Example 3.5.9: Let () -2+. Then

                                              lim () = 0.

                                                              

Proof: The claim follows once we know

                                               lim -2 +  = -

                                                                

and
                                                    lim   = 0,

                                                                     -

which is usually proved when the exponential function is defined.

3.6 Monotone functions and continuity

Note: 1 lecture (optional, can safely be omitted unless §4.4 is also covered, requires §3.5)

Definition 3.6.1. Let   . We say  :    is increasing (resp. strictly increasing) if
,    with  <  implies  ()   () (resp.  () <  ()). We define decreasing and
strictly decreasing in the same way by switching the inequalities for  .

    If a function is either increasing or decreasing, we say it is monotone. If it is strictly
increasing or strictly decreasing, we say it is strictly monotone.

    Sometimes nondecreasing (resp. nonincreasing) is used for increasing (resp. decreasing)
function to emphasize it is not strictly increasing (resp. strictly decreasing).

    If  is increasing, then -  is decreasing and vice versa. Therefore, many results about
monotone functions can just be proved for, say, increasing functions, and the results follow
easily for decreasing functions.

3.6.1 Continuity of monotone functions

One-sided limits for monotone functions are computed by computing infima and suprema.

Proposition 3.6.2. Let   ,   ,  :    be increasing, and  :    be decreasing. If
 is a cluster point of   (-, ), then

lim-  () = sup{  () :  < ,   } and lim- () = inf{() :  < ,   }.
                                                      

If  is a cluster point of   (, ), then

lim         ()  =  inf{    ()  :    >  ,      }  and  lim       ()  =  sup{  ( )  :    >  ,      }.

       +                                                     +
                                                      

If  is a cluster point of , then

            lim  () = sup{  () :   } and lim () = inf{() :   }.
                                                      

If - is a cluster point of , then

            lim  () = inf{  () :   } and              lim () = sup{() :   }.
          -                                           -

    Namely, all the one-sided limits exist whenever they make sense. For monotone
functions therefore, when we say the left-hand limit   - exists, we mean that  is a
cluster point of   (-, ), and same for the right-hand limit.

Proof. Let us assume  is increasing, and we will show the first equality. The rest of the

proof is very similar and is left as an exercise.
    Let  sup{  () :  < ,   }. If  = , then given an   , there exists an   ,

 < , such that  () > . As  is increasing,  ()   () >  for all    with
 > . Take   -  > 0 to obtain the definition of the limit going to infinity.
150                              CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

Next suppose  < . Let  > 0 be given. Because  is the supremum and   (-, )

is nonempty,    and there exists an   ,  < , such that  () >  - . As  is
increasing, if    and  <  < , we have  -  <  ()   ()  . Let   - . Then
for     (-, ) with | - | < , we have  () -  < .
                                                                               

   Suppose  :    is increasing,   , and that both one-sided limits exist. Since
 ()   ()   () whenever  <  < , taking the limits we obtain

     lim-  ()    ()                lim         ().
     
                                          +
                                   

Then  is continuous at  if and only if both limits are equal to each other (and hence equal
to  ()). See also Proposition 3.1.17. See Figure 3.11 to get an idea of what a discontinuity

looks like.

Corollary 3.6.3. If    is an interval and  :    is monotone and not constant, then  () is
an interval if and only if  is continuous.

    Assuming  is not constant is to avoid the technicality that  () is a single point:  () is
a single point if and only if  is constant. A constant function is continuous.

Proof. Without loss of generality, suppose  is increasing.
    First suppose  is continuous. Take two points  (1),  (2) in  () and suppose

 (1) <  (2). As  is increasing, then 1 < 2. By the intermediate value theorem, given
 with  (1) <  <  (2), we find a   (1, 2)   such that  () = , so    (). Hence,
 () is an interval.

    Let us prove the reverse direction by contrapositive. Suppose  is not continuous at
  , and that  is not an endpoint of . Let

 lim-  () = sup  () :   ,  <  ,      lim         ()  =  inf   () :   ,  >   .

                                            +
                                   

As  is a discontinuity,  < . If  < , then  ()  , and if  > , then  ()  . Therefore

no point in (, ) \  () is in  (). There exists 1   with 1 < , so  (1)  , and there
exists 2   with 2 > , so  (2)  . Both  (1) and  (2) are in  (), but there are points
in between them that are not in  (). So  () is not an interval. See Figure 3.11.

When    is an endpoint, the proof is similar and is left as an exercise.       

    A striking property of monotone functions is that they cannot have too many disconti-
nuities.

Corollary 3.6.4. Let    be an interval and  :    be monotone. Then  has at most
countably many discontinuities.

Proof. Let    be the set of all discontinuities that are not endpoints of . As there are
only two endpoints, it is enough to show that  is countable. Without loss of generality,
suppose  is increasing. We will define an injection  :   . For each   , both
one-sided limits of  exist as  is not an endpoint. Let

 lim-  () = sup  () :   ,  <  ,      lim         ()  =  inf   () :   ,  >   .

Figure 3.11: Increasing function  :    discontinuity at .

As  is a discontinuity,  < . There exists a rational number   (, ), so let () .

Suppose    is another discontinuity. If  > , there exist an    with  <  < , and so

lim-  ()  . Hence the rational number we choose for () is different from , since
 = () <  and () > . Similarly if  < . After making such a choice for every element

has a discontinuity at all points 1 - 1/ for   . In particular, there are countably many

discontinuities, but the function is bounded and defined on a closed bounded interval. See

Figure 3.12.

such as the rational numbers. See the exercises.

3.6.2 Continuity of inverse functions

A strictly monotone function  is one-to-one (injective). To see this fact, notice that if   ,
then we can assume  < . Either  () <  () if  is strictly increasing or  () >  () if  is
strictly decreasing, so  ()   (). Hence,  must have an inverse  -1 defined on its range.

Proposition 3.6.6. If    is an interval and  :    is strictly monotone, then the inverse
 -1 :  ()   is continuous.

Proof. Suppose  is strictly increasing. The proof is almost identical for a strictly decreasing
function. Since  is strictly increasing, so is  -1. That is, if  () <  (), then we must have
 <  and therefore  -1  () <  -1  () .

    Take    (). If  is not a cluster point of  (), then  -1 is continuous at  automatically.
So let  be a cluster point of  (). Suppose both of the following one-sided limits exist:

     0         lim  -1() = sup   -1() :  < ,    ()  = sup    :  () <  ,

                      -
               

     1 lim  -1() = inf  -1() :  > ,    () = inf    :  () >  .

               +

We have 0  1 as  -1 is increasing. For all    where  > 0, we have  ()  . As  is
strictly increasing, we must have  () >  for all    where  > 0. Therefore,

                 {   :  > 0}     :  () >  .

The infimum of the left-hand set is 0, and the infimum of the right-hand set is 1, so we
obtain 0  1. So 1 = 0, and  -1 is continuous at .

If one of the one-sided limits does not exist, the argument is similar and is left as an

exercise.                                                                

Example 3.6.7: The proposition does not require  itself to be continuous. Let  :   

be defined by

                                 ()       if  < 0,

                                 + 1 if   0.

The function  is not continuous at 0. The image of  =  is the set (-, 0)  [1, ), not an
interval. Then  -1 : (-, 0)  [1, )   can be written as

                                 -1() =   if  < 0,

                                 - 1 if   1.

It is not difficult to see that  -1 is a continuous function. See Figure 3.13 for the graphs.

    Notice what happens with the proposition if  () is an interval. In that case, we
could simply apply Corollary 3.6.3 to both  and  -1. That is, if  :    is an onto
strictly monotone function and  and  are intervals, then both  and  -1 are continuous.
Furthermore,  () is an interval precisely when  is continuous.

The Derivative

4.1 The derivative

Note: 1 lecture

    The idea of a derivative is the following. If the graph of a function looks locally like
a straight line, then we can talk about the slope of this line. The slope tells us the rate at
which the value of the function is changing at that particular point. Of course, we are
leaving out any function that has corners or discontinuities. Let us be precise.

                                     lim  () -  ()
                                            - 

exists, then we say  is differentiable at , we call  the derivative of  at , and we write
 () .

If  is differentiable at all   , then we simply say that  is differentiable, and then we
                                                                            
obtain  a  function  :      .  The  derivative  is  sometimes  written  as    or     () .
                                                                                  

The expression -  ()-  () is called the difference quotient.

    The graphical interpretation of the derivative is depicted in Figure 4.1. The left-hand
plot gives the line through ,  () and ,  () with slope -  ()-  () , that is, the so-called
secant line. When we take the limit as  goes to , we get the right-hand plot, where we see
that the derivative of the function at the point  is the slope of the line tangent to the graph
of  at the point ,  () .

    We allow  to be a closed interval and we allow  to be an endpoint of . Some calculus
books do not allow  to be an endpoint of an interval, but all the theory still works by

allowing it, and it makes our work easier.

Example 4.1.2: Let  ()   2 defined on the whole real line. Let    be arbitrary. We
find that if   ,          2 - 2  -  = ( + )( - )  -  = ( + ).

Therefore,               () = lim 2 - 2 = lim( + ) = 2.
                                   -  
Example 4.1.3: Let  ()
                          +  for numbers ,   . Let    be arbitrary. For   ,

                                         () -  ()  -  = ( - )  -  = .

Therefore,               () = lim  () -  () = lim  = .

                                          -              

In fact, every differentiable function "infinitesimally" behaves like the affine function  + .

You can guess many results and formulas for derivatives if you work them out for affine

functions first.

Example 4.1.4: The function  ()  is differentiable for  > 0. To see this fact, fix  > 0,
and suppose    and  > 0. Compute

                   -                     -                  = 1 .
                              =          
                         -  (  - )(  + )  + 

Therefore,          - 

                   () = lim             = lim   =  .     1             1

                          -    +  2

Example 4.1.5: The function  () || is not differentiable at the origin. When  > 0,

                           || - |0|  - 0 =  - 0  - 0 = 1.

When  < 0,                 || - |0|  - 0 = - - 0  - 0 = -1.

    A famous example of Weierstrass shows that there exists a continuous function that is
not differentiable at any point. The construction of this function is beyond the scope of this
chapter. On the other hand, a differentiable function is always continuous.

Proposition 4.1.6. Let  :    be differentiable at   , then it is continuous at .

Proof. We know the limits

                     lim  () -  () =  () and           lim( - ) = 0
                       - 
                                                       
exist. Furthermore,         () -  () =  () -  ()  - 
                                                      ( - ).

Therefore, the limit of  () -  () exists and

            lim  () -  () = lim  () -  ()     lim( - ) =  () · 0 = 0.
                             - 
                                              

Hence lim  () =  (), and  is continuous at .                                        


    An important property of the derivative is linearity. The derivative is the approximation

of a function by a straight line. The slope of a line through two points changes linearly
when the -coordinates are changed linearly. Taking the limit, it makes sense that the

derivative is linear.

Proposition 4.1.7 (Linearity). Let  be an interval, let  :    and  :    be differentiable
at   , and let   .

(i) Define  :    by ()   (). Then  is differentiable at  and () =   ().

(ii) Define  :    by ()     () + (). Then  is differentiable at  and () =
      () + ().

Proof. First, let ()   (). For   ,   ,

                              () - ()  -  =   () -   ()  -  =   () -  ()  -  .
The limit as  goes to  exists on the right-hand side by Corollary 3.1.12. We get

                           lim () - () =  lim  () -  () .
                             -                  - 
158                                            CHAPTER 4. THE DERIVATIVE

Therefore,  is differentiable at , and the derivative is computed as given.
    Next, define ()  () + (). For   ,   , we have

            () - ()  -  =  () + () -  () + ()  -  =  () -  ()  -  + () - ()  -  .
The limit as  goes to  exists on the right-hand side by Corollary 3.1.12. We get

     lim () - () = lim  () -  () + lim () - () .
       -                              -          - 

Therefore,  is differentiable at , and the derivative is computed as given.                    

    It is not true that the derivative of a product of two functions is the product of the
derivatives. Instead we get the so-called product rule or the Leibniz rule.

Proposition 4.1.8 (Product rule). Let  be an interval, let  :    and  :    be functions
differentiable at . If  :    is defined by

                                    ()  ()(),

then  is differentiable at  and

                                    () =  ()() +  ()().

   The proof of the product rule is left as an exercise. The key to the proof is the identity
 ()() -  ()() =  () () - () +  () -  () (), which is illustrated in Figure 4.2.

     ()                                         () -  () ()
                        () () - ()

Figure 4.2: The idea of product rule. The area of the entire rectangle  ()() differs from the
area of the white rectangle  ()() by the area of the lightly shaded rectangle  () () - ()
plus the darker rectangle  () -  () (). In other words, (  · ) =  ·  +   · .

Proposition 4.1.9 (Quotient rule). Let  be an interval, let  :    and  :    be
differentiable at  and ()  0 for all   . If  :    is defined by

                                        ()  () () ,

then  is differentiable at  and

                                  () =   ()() -  ()()
                                                2.
                                            ()

Again, the proof is left as an exercise.

4.1.2 Chain rule

More complicated functions are often obtained by composition, which is differentiated via
the chain rule. The rule also tells us how a derivative changes if we change variables.
Proposition 4.1.10 (Chain rule). Let 1, 2 be intervals, let  : 1  2 be differentiable at   1,
and  : 2   be differentiable at (). If  : 1   is defined by

                                        () (   )() =  () ,

then  is differentiable at  and    () =   () ().

Proof. Let  (). Define  : 2   and  : 1   by

()                    ()-  ()      if   ,   ()        ( )-  ( )  if   ,
                        -          if  = ,               -       if  = .

                      ()                             ()

Because  is differentiable at  = (), we find that  is continuous at . Similarly,  is
continuous at . For any  and ,

 () -  () = ()( - ) and () - () = ()( - ).

Plug in to obtain

() - () =  () -  () =  () () - () =  () ()( - ) .

Therefore, if   ,
                                          () - ()  -  =  () (). (4.1)

By continuity of  and  at  and  respectively, we find lim () =  () =   () and
lim () = (). The function  is continuous at , and so lim () = (). Hence
the limit of the right-hand side of (4.1) as  goes to  exists and is equal to   () ().
Thus  is differentiable at  and () =   () ().

4.2 Mean value theorem

Note: 2 lectures (some applications may be skipped)

4.2.1 Relative minima and maxima

We previously talked about absolute maxima and minima. These are the tallest peaks and
the lowest valleys in the entire mountain range. What about peaks of individual mountains
and bottoms of individual valleys? The derivative, being a local concept, is like walking
around in a fog; it cannot tell you if you are on the highest peak, but it can tell you whether
you are at the top of some peak.

Definition 4.2.1. Let    be a set and let  :    be a function. The function  is said
to have a relative maximum at    if there exists a  > 0 such that for all    where
| - | < , we have  ()   (). The definition of relative minimum is analogous.

Lemma 4.2.2. Suppose  : (, )   is differentiable at   (, ), and  has a relative minimum
or a relative maximum at . Then  () = 0.

Proof. Suppose  is a relative maximum of  . That is, there is a  > 0 such that for every

  (, ) where | - | < , we have  () -  ()  0. Consider the difference quotient. If

 <  <  + , then                       () -  ()  -   0,

and if  -  <  < , then                () -  ()  -   0.

See Figure 4.3 for an illustration.

                 slope = - ( )- ( )  0                     slope = - ( )- ( )  0

Figure 4.3: Slopes of secants at a relative maximum.

As    <    <  ,  there  exist  sequences  {   }       and  {  }        in  (,  )  such  that    <    <  +

                                                  =1               =1
and  -  <  <  for all   , and such that lim  = lim  = . Since  is

differentiable at ,

0  lim  () -  () =  () = lim  () -  ()  0.
                       -     - 

We are done with a maximum. For a minimum, consider the function -  .  

    For a differentiable function, a point where  () = 0 is called a critical point. When  is
not differentiable at some points, it is common to also say that  is a critical point if  ()
does not exist. The theorem says that a relative minimum or maximum at an interior point
of an interval must be a critical point. As you remember from calculus, one finds minima
and maxima of a function by finding all the critical points together with the endpoints of
the interval and simply checking at which of these points is the function biggest or smallest.

4.2.2 Rolle's theorem

Suppose a function has the same value at both endpoints of an interval. Intuitively, it ought
to attain a minimum or a maximum in the interior of the interval, then at such a minimum
or a maximum, the derivative should be zero. See Figure 4.4 for the geometric idea. This is
the content of the so-called Rolle's theorem.

  Figure 4.4: Point where the tangent line is horizontal, that is  () = 0.

Theorem 4.2.3 (Rolle). Let  : [, ]   be a continuous function differentiable on (, ) such
that  () =  (). Then there exists a   (, ) such that  () = 0.
Proof. As  is continuous on [, ], it attains an absolute minimum and an absolute
maximum in [, ]. We wish to apply Lemma 4.2.2, and so we need to find some   (, )
where  attains a minimum or a maximum. Write   () =  (). If there exists an
 such that  () > , then the absolute maximum is larger than  and hence occurs at
some   (, ), and therefore  () = 0. On the other hand, if there exists an  such that

     Named after the French mathematician Michel Rolle (1652-1719).
164                           CHAPTER 4. THE DERIVATIVE

 () < , then the absolute minimum occurs at some   (, ), and so  () = 0. If there
is no  such that  () >  or  () < , then  () =  for all  and then  () = 0 for all

  [, ], so any   (, ) works.                                         

    It is absolutely necessary that the derivative exists for all   (, ). Consider the
function  () || on [-1, 1]. Clearly  (-1) =  (1), but there is no point  where  () = 0.

4.2.3 Mean value theorem

We extend Rolle's theorem to functions that attain different values at the endpoints.
Theorem 4.2.4 (Mean value theorem). Let  : [, ]   be a continuous function differentiable
on (, ). Then there exists a point   (, ) such that

                                           () -  () =  ()( - ).

    For a geometric interpretation of the mean value theorem, see Figure 4.5. The idea is
that the value -  ()-  () is the slope of the line between the points ,  () and ,  () .
Then  is the point such that  () = -  ()-  () , that is, the tangent line at the point ,  ()
has the same slope as the line between ,  () and ,  () . The name comes from the
fact that the slope of the secant line is the mean value of the derivative, so the average
derivative is achieved in the interior of the interval.

    The theorem follows from Rolle's theorem by subtracting from  the affine linear
function with the derivative -  ()-  () with the same values at  and  as  . That is, we
subtract the function whose graph is the straight line ,  () and ,  () . Then we are
looking for a point where this new function has derivative zero.

                              ( , ( ))

                               ( , ( ))

  Figure 4.5: Graphical interpretation of the mean value theorem.

Proof. Define the function  : [, ]   by
                                ()  () -  () -  () -  ()  -  ( - ).
4.2. MEAN VALUE THEOREM                                          165

The function  is differentiable on (, ), continuous on [, ], such that () = 0 and
() = 0. Thus there exists a   (, ) such that () = 0, that is,

                    0 = () =  () -  () -  ()  -  .

In other words,  () -  () =  ()( - ).                            

    The proof generalizes. By considering ()  () -  () - ()-()  ()-  () () - () , one
can prove the following version. We leave the proof as an exercise.

Theorem 4.2.5 (Cauchy's mean value theorem). Let  : [, ]   and  : [, ]   be
continuous functions differentiable on (, ). Then there exists a point   (, ) such that

                     () -  () () =  () () - () .

    The mean value theorem has the distinction of being one of the few theorems cited in
court. That is, when police measure the speed of cars by aircraft, or via cameras reading
license plates, they measure the time the car takes to go between two points. The mean
value theorem then says that the car must have somewhere attained the speed you get by
dividing the difference in distance by the difference in time.

4.2.4 Applications

Let us look at a few applications of the mean value theorem. The applications show the
typical use of the theorem, which is to get rid of a limit by finding the right sort of points
where the derivative is not just close to some difference quotient, but actually equal to one.
First, we solve our very first differential equation.

Proposition 4.2.6. Let  be an interval and let  :    be a differentiable function such that
 () = 0 for all   . Then  is constant.

Proof. Take arbitrary ,    with  < . As  is an interval, [, ]  . Then  restricted to

[, ] satisfies the hypotheses of the mean value theorem. Therefore, there is a   (, )

such that                 () -  () =  ()( - ).

As  () = 0, we have  () =  (). Hence, the function is constant.  

    Now that we know what it means for the function to stay constant, we look at increasing
and decreasing functions. We say  :    is increasing (resp. strictly increasing) if  < 
implies  ()   () (resp.  () <  ()). We define decreasing and strictly decreasing in the
same way by switching the inequalities for  .

Proposition 4.2.7. Let  be an interval and let  :    be a differentiable function.

   (i)  is increasing if and only if  ()  0 for all   .

  (ii)  is decreasing if and only if  ()  0 for all   .
166                                                CHAPTER 4. THE DERIVATIVE

Proof. Let us prove the first item. Suppose  is increasing. For all ,    with   ,

                                                  () -  ()  -   0.
Taking a limit as  goes to , we see that  ()  0.

    For the other direction, suppose  ()  0 for all   . Take any ,    where  < ,
and note that [, ]  . By the mean value theorem, there is some   (, ) such that

                                       () -  () =  ()( - ).

As  ()  0 and  -  > 0, then  () -  ()  0 or  ()   (), and so  is increasing.

We leave the second item, decreasing  , to the reader as an exercise.                               

A similar but weaker statement is true for strictly increasing and decreasing functions.

Proposition 4.2.8. Let  be an interval and let  :    be a differentiable function.
   (i) If  () > 0 for all   , then  is strictly increasing.
  (ii) If  () < 0 for all   , then  is strictly decreasing.

The proof of (i) is left as an exercise. Then (ii) follows from (i) by considering -  instead.

The converse of this proposition is not true. The function  ()                  3 is strictly increasing,
but  (0) = 0.

    Another application of the mean value theorem is the following result about the location

of extrema, sometimes called the first derivative test. The result is stated for an absolute
minimum and maximum. To apply it to find relative minima and maxima, restrict  to an
interval ( - ,  + ).

Proposition 4.2.9. Let  : (, )   be continuous. Let   (, ) and suppose  is differentiable
on (, ) and (, ).

   (i) If  ()  0 whenever   (, ) and  ()  0 whenever   (, ), then  has an absolute
       minimum at .

  (ii) If  ()  0 whenever   (, ) and  ()  0 whenever   (, ), then  has an absolute
       maximum at .

Proof. We prove the first item and leave the second to the reader. Take   (, ) and a
          {  }
sequence              such  that      <      <      for all  and lim            =  .  By the preceding
                  =1
proposition,  is decreasing on (, ) so  ()   () for all . As  is continuous at , we
take the limit to get  ()   ().
                                             }
Similarly,  take        (,    )  and  {            a sequence such that    <    <     and lim    =  .
                                               =1
The function is increasing on (, ) so  ()   () for all . By continuity of  , we get
 ()   (). Thus  ()   () for all   (, ).
                                                                                                    

    The converse of the proposition does not hold. See Example 4.2.12 below.

    Another often used application of the mean value theorem you have possibly seen in
calculus is the following result on differentiability at the end points of an interval. The
proof is Exercise 4.2.13.
4.2. MEAN VALUE THEOREM                    167

Proposition 4.2.10.
   (i) Suppose  : [, )   is continuous, differentiable in (, ), and lim  () = . Then
         is differentiable at  and  () = .
  (ii) Suppose  : (, ]   is continuous, differentiable in (, ), and lim  () = . Then
         is differentiable at  and  () = .

    In fact, using the extension result Proposition 3.4.6, you do not need to assume that  is
defined at the end point. See Exercise 4.2.14.

4.2.5 Continuity of derivatives and the intermediate value theorem

Derivatives of functions satisfy an intermediate value property.

Theorem 4.2.11 (Darboux). Let  : [, ]   be differentiable. Suppose    is such that
 () <  <  () or  () >  >  (). Then there exists a   (, ) such that  () = .

    The proof follows by subtracting  and a linear function with derivative . The new
function  reduces the problem to the case  = 0, where () > 0 > (). That is,  is
increasing at  and decreasing at , so it must attain a maximum inside (, ), where the
derivative is zero. See Figure 4.6.

                         ( ) = 0  ( ) < 0

( ) > 0

  Figure 4.6: Idea of the proof of Darboux theorem.

Proof. Suppose  () <  <  (). Define
                                               ()  -  ().

The function  is continuous on [, ], and so  attains a maximum at some   [, ].
    The function  is also differentiable on [, ]. Compute () =  -  (). Thus () > 0.

As the derivative is the limit of difference quotients and is positive, there must be some
difference quotient that is positive. That is, there must exist an  >  such that

                                                 () - ()  -  > 0,
168                                                      CHAPTER 4. THE DERIVATIVE

or () > (). Thus  cannot possibly have a maximum at . Similarly, as () < 0,
we find an  <  (a different ) such that - ()-() < 0 or that () > (), thus  cannot
possibly have a maximum at . Therefore,   (, ), and Lemma 4.2.2 applies: As  attains
a maximum at , we find () = 0 and so  () = .
Similarly, if  () >  >  (), consider ()  () - .
                                                                                               

    We have seen already that there exist discontinuous functions that have the intermediate
value property. While it is hard to imagine at first, there also exist functions that are
differentiable everywhere and the derivative is not continuous.

Example 4.2.12: Let  :    be the function defined by

                                  ()  sin(1/) 2 if   0,
                                          0         if  = 0.

We claim that  is differentiable everywhere, but   :    is not continuous at the origin.
Furthermore,  has a minimum at 0, but the derivative changes sign infinitely often near

the origin. See Figure 4.7.

Figure 4.7: A function with a discontinuous derivative. The function  is on the left and   is
on the right. Notice that  ()  2 on the left graph.

Proof: It is immediate from the definition that  has an absolute minimum at 0; we

know  ()  0 for all  and  (0) = 0.

For   0,  is differentiable and the derivative is 2 sin(1/)  sin(1/) - cos(1/) . As an
                                                          ()
exercise,  show  that  for    =      4    we  have  lim       =  -1,  and  for    =      4    we

                                 (8+1) ,                                             (8+3) ,
have lim  () = 1. So   cannot be continuous at 0 no matter what  (0) is.
Let us show that  is differentiable at 0 and  (0) = 0. For   0,

                        () -  (0)  - 0 - 0 = 2 sin2(1/)  =  sin2(1/)  || .
4.2. MEAN VALUE THEOREM                                                                                                         169

And, of course, as  tends to zero, || tends to zero, and hence -0  ()-  (0) - 0 goes to zero.
Therefore,  is differentiable at 0 and the derivative at 0 is 0. A key point in the calculation
above is that  ()  2, see also Exercises 4.1.11 and 4.1.12.

    It is sometimes useful to assume the derivative of a differentiable function is continuous.
If  :    is differentiable and the derivative   is continuous on , then we say 
is continuously differentiable. It is common to write 1() for the set of continuously
differentiable functions on .

4.3 Taylor's theorem

Note: less than a lecture (optional section)

4.3.1 Derivatives of higher orders

When  :    is differentiable, we obtain a function   :   . The function   is called
the first derivative of  . If   is differentiable, we denote by   :    the derivative of  .
The function   is called the second derivative of  . We similarly obtain  ,  , and so on.
With a larger number of derivatives the notation would get out of hand; we denote by  ()
the th derivative of  . When  possesses  derivatives, we say  is  times differentiable.

4.3.2 Taylor's theorem

Taylor's theorem is a generalization of the mean value theorem. Mean value theorem says
that up to a small error  () for  near 0 can be approximated by  (0), that is

                         () =  (0) +  ()( - 0),

where the "error" is measured in terms of the first derivative at some point  between 

and 0. Taylor's theorem generalizes this result to higher derivatives. It tells us that up to
a small error, any  times differentiable function can be approximated at a point 0 by a
polynomial. The error of this approximation behaves like ( - 0) near the point 0. To
see why this is a good approximation, notice that for a big , ( - 0) is very small in a
small interval around 0.

Definition 4.3.1. For an  times differentiable function  defined near a point 0  ,
define the th order Taylor polynomial for  at 0 as

  0            ()(0)( - 0)                        (3)(0) ( - 0)3
            =0 !                                    6
 ()          (0) +  (  (0) 0)( - 0) + ( - 0)2 +
         =
                                              2
              + · · · +  ()(0)( - 0).

                            !

    See Figure 4.8 for the odd-degree Taylor polynomials for the sine function at 0 = 0.
The even-degree terms are all zero, as even derivatives of sine are again sines, which are

zero at the origin.
    Taylor's theorem says a function behaves like its th Taylor polynomial. The mean

value theorem is really Taylor's theorem for  = 0.

     Named for the English mathematician Brook Taylor (1685-1731). It was first found by the Scottish
mathematician James Gregory (1638-1675). The statement we give was proved by Joseph-Louis Lagrange
(1736-1813).

Theorem 4.3.2 (Taylor). Suppose  : [, ]   is a function with  continuous derivatives on
[, ] and such that  (+1) exists on (, ). Given distinct points 0 and  in [, ], we can find a
point  between 0 and  such that

                                  0  (+1)() +1
                           () =  () +                ( - 0) .

     0           (+1)()              +1
The term  () (+1)! ( - 0) is called the remainder term. This form of the
remainder term is called the Lagrange form of the remainder. There are other ways to write

the remainder term, but we skip those. Note that  depends on both  and 0.

Proof. Find a number ,0 (depending on  and 0) solving the equation

                                  0                  +1
                           () =  () + ,0( - 0) .

Define a function () by

                                     0                         +1
                         ()  () -  () - ,0( - 0) .

We compute the  th derivative at  0                                                     0 ()  =   ()(0) for

                                     of the Taylor polynomial ( ) (0)
 = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,  (the zeroth derivative of a function is the function itself). Therefore,

                (0) = (0) = (0) = · · · = ()(0) = 0.

In particular, (0) = 0. On the other hand () = 0. By the mean value theorem, there
exists an 1 between 0 and  such that (1) = 0. Applying the mean value theorem to ,
we obtain that there exists 2 between 0 and 1 (and therefore between 0 and ) such
that (2) = 0. We repeat the argument  + 1 times to obtain a number +1 between 0
and  (and therefore between 0 and ) such that (+1)(+1) = 0.
4.3. TAYLOR'S THEOREM                                                                                     173

Let  +1. We compute the ( + 1)th derivative of  to find

                              (+1)() =  (+1)() - ( + 1)! ,0 .

Plugging in  for  we obtain ,0 = (+1)!  (+1)() , and we are done. 

In  the  proof,    we  found      0 ()   =     ()(0)    for    =  0, 1, 2, . . . , .   Therefore,    the  Taylor

                              ( ) (0)
polynomial has the same derivatives as  at 0 up to the th derivative. That is why the

Taylor polynomial is a good approximation to  . Notice how in Figure 4.8 the Taylor

polynomials are reasonably good approximations to the sine near  = 0.

We do not necessarily get good approximations by the Taylor polynomial everywhere.
                                               
Consider expanding the function  ()           1-        around    0,   for     <  1,   we  get  the  graphs     in

Figure 4.9. The dotted lines are the first, second, and third degree approximations. The

dashed line is the 20th degree polynomial. The approximation does seem to get better as

the degree rises for  > -1. For  < -1, it in fact gets visibly worse. The polynomials are
                                                        
the partial sums of the geometric series      =1          ,  and  the  series  only    converges     on   (-1,  1).

See the discussion of power series §2.6.

polynomial     20  (dashed).

If  is infinitely differentiable, that is, if  can be differentiated any number of times, then

we define the Taylor series:               ()(0)( - 0).
                                         =0 !

There is no guarantee that this series converges for any   0. Even where it does converge,
there is no guarantee that it converges to the function  . Functions  whose Taylor series
at every point 0 converges to  in some open interval containing 0 are called analytic

functions. Many functions one tends to see in practice are analytic. See Exercise 5.4.11, for

an example of a non-analytic function.
174                                              CHAPTER 4. THE DERIVATIVE

    The definition of derivative says that a function is differentiable if it is locally approxi-

mated by a line. We mention in passing that there exists a converse to Taylor's theorem,

which we will neither state nor prove, saying that if a function is locally approximated in a
certain way by a polynomial of degree , then it has  derivatives.

    Taylor's theorem gives us a quick proof of a version of the second derivative test. By a
strict relative minimum of  at , we mean that there exists a  > 0 such that  () >  () for
all   ( - ,  + ) where   . A strict relative maximum is defined similarly. Continuity

of the second derivative is not needed, but the proof is more difficult and is left as an
exercise. The proof also generalizes immediately into the th derivative test, which is also

left as an exercise.

Proposition 4.3.3 (Second derivative test). Suppose  : (, )   is twice continuously
differentiable, 0  (, ),  (0) = 0 and  (0) > 0. Then  has a strict relative minimum at 0.

Proof. As   is continuous, there exists a  > 0 such that  () > 0 for all   (0 - , 0 + ),
see Exercise 3.2.11. Take   (0 - , 0 + ),   0. Taylor's theorem says that for some 
between 0 and ,

      () =  (0) +  (  () 0)( - 0) + ( - 0)2 =  (  () 0) + ( - 0)2.
     2                                           2

As  () > 0 and ( - 0)2 > 0, we have  () >  (0).

4.4 Inverse function theorem

Note: less than 1 lecture (optional section, needed for §5.4, requires §3.6)

4.4.1 Inverse function theorem

We start with a simple example. Consider the function  ()  for a number   0.
                                                                 -1()                            ()
Then    :           is  bective,   and        the  inverse  is         =  1 .  In  particular,       =    and

(  -1)()   =  1.  As  differentiable  functions    are                         like"   linear   functions,  we
                                                            "infinitesimally
              
expect the same sort of behavior from the inverse of a differentiable function. The main

idea of differentiating inverse functions is the following lemma.

Lemma 4.4.1. Let ,    be intervals. If  :    is strictly monotone (hence one-to-one),
onto (  () = ), differentiable at 0  , and  (0)  0, then the inverse  -1 is differentiable at
0 =  (0) and

                                     (  -1)(0) = 1    -1( = 0)   1( . 0)

If  is continuously differentiable and   is never zero, then  -1 is continuously differentiable.

Proof. By Proposition 3.6.6,  has a continuous inverse. For convenience, call the inverse

 :   . Let 0, 0 be as in the statement. For   , write   (). If   0, and so
  0, we find

                        () - (0) =   () -   (0) =  - 0 .
                         - 0                        () -  (0)              () -  (0)

See Figure 4.10 for the geometric idea.

         slope =  - 0 ( )- ( 0) =     -0                                           -0    ( )- ( 0)
                                   ( )- ( 0)                    slope = ( )- ( 0) = - 0
      ( 0) = 0

                                                            0 = ( 0)

                      = ( ) 0 = ( 0)                                               ( )=         ( 0) = 0

4.4. INVERSE FUNCTION THEOREM                                           177

Let -0                                  if   0,
                              ()-  (0)  if  = 0 (notice that  (0)  0).
()                             1

                              (0)

As  is differentiable at 0,

lim () = lim  - 0 =  1 = (0),
0                                  0  () -  (0)  (0)

that is,  is continuous at 0. As () is continuous at 0, the composition  () =
-0 ()-(0) is continuous at 0 by Proposition 3.2.7. Therefore,

1 =  (0) = lim  () = lim () - (0) .
  (0)                                   0     0  - 0

So  is differentiable at 0, and   (0) = ((0) 1 ) .
    If   is continuous and nonzero at all   , then the lemma applies at all   . As  is

also continuous (it is differentiable), the derivative   () = (() 1 ) must be continuous. 

    What is usually called the inverse function theorem is the following result.
Theorem 4.4.2 (Inverse function theorem). Let  : (, )   be a continuously differentiable
function, 0  (, ) a point where  (0)  0. Then there exists an open interval   (, ) with
0  , the restriction  | is injective with a continuously differentiable inverse  :    defined
on an interval   (), and

                                 () = 1   ()  for all   .

Proof. Without loss of generality, suppose  (0) > 0. As   is continuous, there must exist
an open interval  = (0 - , 0 + ) such that  () > 0 for all   . See Exercise 3.2.11.

    By Proposition 4.2.8,  is strictly increasing on , and hence the restriction  | is bective
onto  :=  (). As  is continuous, Corollary 3.6.3 (or directly via the intermediate value

theorem) implies that  () is an interval. Now apply Lemma 4.4.1.        
                                                                        
In Example 1.2.3, we saw how difficult an endeavor was proving the existence of 2

without any tools. With the intermediate value theorem, the the existence of roots is almost

trivial, and with the machinery of this section, we will prove far more than mere existence.

Corollary 4.4.3. Given    and   0, there exists a unique number   0 (denoted 1/ ),
such that  = . Furthermore, the function  : (0, )  (0, ) defined by () 1/ is

continuously differentiable and

using the convention /         () = 1 (-1)/ = 1 (1-)/ ,
                             ( 1/ ) .
178  CHAPTER 4. THE DERIVATIVE

Proof. For  = 0, the existence of a unique root is trivial.
    Let  : (0, )  (0, ) be defined by  () . The function  is continuously

differentiable, and  () =  -1, see Exercise 4.1.3. For  > 0, the derivative   is strictly
positive, and so again by Proposition 4.2.8,  is strictly increasing (this can also be proved
directly) and hence injective. Suppose  and  are such that  > 1 and 1 >  > 0. Then
 () =    and  () =   . For every  with  <  < , we have, by the
intermediate value theorem, that    [, ]   (0, ) . As  and  were arbitrary, 
is onto (0, ), and hence  is bective. Let  be the inverse of  , and we obtain the existence
and uniqueness of positive th roots. Lemma 4.4.1 says that  has a continuous derivative
and   () = (() 1 ) = (1/) 1 -1 . 

Example 4.4.4: The corollary provides a good example of where the inverse function
theorem gives us an interval smaller than (, ). Take  :    defined by  () 2.
Then  (0)  0 as long as 0  0. If 0 > 0, we can take  = (0, ), but no larger.

Example 4.4.5: Another useful example is  () 3. The function  :    is one-to-one
and onto, so  -1() = 1/3 exists on the entire real line, including zero and negative . The
function  has a continuous derivative, but  -1 has no derivative at the origin. The point is
that  (0) = 0. See Figure 4.11 for a graph. Notice the vertical tangent on the cube root at
the origin. See also Exercise 4.4.4.

The Riemann Integral

5.1 The Riemann integral

Note: 1.5 lectures

    An integral is a way to "sum" the values of a function. There is sometimes confusion
among students of calculus between the integral and the antiderivative. The integral is
(informally) the area under the curve, nothing else. That we can compute an antiderivative
using the integral is a nontrivial result we must prove. We will define the Riemann integral
using the Darboux integral, an equivalent but technically simpler definition.

5.1.1 Partitions and lower and upper integrals

We want to integrate a bounded function defined on an interval [, ]. We first define two
auxiliary integrals that are defined for all bounded functions. Only then can we talk about
the Riemann integral and the functions which it can integrate, the Riemann integrable
functions.

Definition 5.1.1. A partition  of [, ] is a finite set of numbers {0, 1, 2, . . . , } such

that
                                  = 0 < 1 < 2 < · · · < -1 <  = .

We write

            - -1.

Suppose  : [, ]   is bounded and  is a partition of [, ]. Define

 inf       () : -1     ,   sup  () : -1     ,
(,  )
                                                

                ,         (,  )                       .

          =1                                    =1

We call (,  ) the lower Darboux sum and (,  ) the upper Darboux sum.

Named after the German mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866).
Named after the French mathematician Jean-Gaston Darboux (1842-1917).
182                                            CHAPTER 5. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

    The geometric idea of Darboux sums is indicated in Figure 5.1. The lower sum is

the area of the shaded rectangles, and the upper sum is the area of the entire rectangles,
shaded plus unshaded parts. The width of the th rectangle is , the height of the shaded
rectangle is , and the height of the entire rectangle is .

Proposition 5.1.2. Let  : [, ]   be a bounded function. Let ,    be such that for all
  [, ], we have    ()  . Then for every partition  of [, ],

                 ( - )  (,  )  (,  )  ( - ).                              (5.1)

Proof. Let  be a partition of [, ]. Note that    for all  and    for all . Also,
   for all . Finally,                (  -  ).
                       =1         =            Therefore,

                                          

( - ) =                =    

          =1           =1                 =1

                                                                  

                                      =                                   = ( - ).

                                     =1           =1             =1

Hence we get (5.1). In particular, the sets of lower and upper sums are bounded sets. 

Definition 5.1.3. As the sets of lower and upper Darboux sums are bounded, we define

          

                ()          sup (,  ) :  a partition of [, ] ,

            

          

                  ()  inf (,  ) :  a partition of [, ] .

                                           
We call the lower Darboux integral and the upper Darboux integral. To avoid worrying

about the variable of integration, we often simply write

                                                              
                                                                    () .
                             ()  and                  
                                                                
5.1. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL                                          183

    If integration is to make sense, then the lower and upper Darboux integrals should
be the same number, as we want a single number to call the integral. However, these two
integrals may differ for some functions.

Example 5.1.4: Take the Dirichlet function  : [0, 1]  , where  ()  1 if    and

 () 0 if   . Then  1              1

                       = 0 and        = 1.

                   0              0

The reason is that for any partition  and every , we have  = inf  () :   [-1, ] = 0
and  = sup  () :   [-1, ] = 1. Thus

                                              

(,  ) = 0 ·  = 0,          and (,  ) = 1 ·  =  = 1.

                  =1                 =1     =1

Remark 5.1.5. The same definition of     and     is used when  is defined on a larger set
 such that [, ]  . In that case, we use the restriction of  to [, ] and we must ensure
that the restriction is bounded on [, ].

    To compute the integral, we often take a partition  and make it finer. That is, we cut
intervals in the partition into yet smaller pieces.

Definition 5.1.6. Let  = {0, 1, . . . , } and  = {0, 1, . . . ,  } be partitions of [, ].
We say  is a refinement of  if as sets   .

    That is,  is a refinement of a partition if it contains all the numbers in  and perhaps
some other numbers in between. For example, {0, 0.5, 1, 2} is a partition of [0, 2] and
{0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.75, 2} is a refinement. The main reason for introducing refinements is
the following proposition.

Proposition 5.1.7. Let  : [, ]   be a bounded function, and let  be a partition of [, ].
Let  be a refinement of . Then

(,  )  (,  ) and (,  )  (,  ).

Proof. The tricky part of this proof is to get the notation correct. Let  = {0, 1, . . . ,  } be
a refinement of  = {0, 1, . . . , }. Then 0 = 0 and  =  . In fact, there are integers
0 < 1 < · · · <  such that  =  for  = 0, 1, 2, . . . , .

     =1           =1 =-1+1                             =1

    The proof of (,  )  (,  ) is left as an exercise.                          

    Armed with refinements, we prove the following. The key point of this next proposition
is that the lower Darboux integral is less than or equal to the upper Darboux integral.

Proposition 5.1.8. Let  : [, ]   be a bounded function. Let ,    be such that for all
  [, ], we have    ()  . Then

                     

           ( - )      ( - ).                                                (5.2)
                            

Proof. By Proposition 5.1.2, for every partition ,

                                ( - )  (,  )  (,  )  ( - ).

The inequality ( -)  (,  ) implies ( -)      . The inequality (,  )  ( -)
implies      ( - ).

    The middle inequality in (5.2) is the main point of the proposition. Let 1, 2 be
partitions of [, ]. Define  1  2. The set  is a partition of [, ], which is a
refinement of 1 and a refinement of 2. By Proposition 5.1.7, (1,  )  (,  ) and
(,  )  (2,  ). So

           (1,  )  (,  )  (,  )  (2,  ).
5.1. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL                                        185

In other words, for two arbitrary partitions 1 and 2, we have (1,  )  (2,  ). Recall
Proposition 1.2.7, and take the supremum and infimum over all partitions:

  
         = sup (,  ) :  a partition of [, ]

      

                                                                                                  
                                               inf (,  ) :  a partition of [, ] =  . 

                                                                                                                                               

5.1.2 Riemann integral

We can finally define the Riemann integral. However, the Riemann integral is only defined
on a certain class of functions, called the Riemann integrable functions.

Definition 5.1.9. Let  : [, ]   be a bounded function such that

                                     

                              ()  =  () .
                                     

Then  is said to be Riemann integrable. The set of Riemann integrable functions on [, ] is
denoted by R [, ] . When   R [, ] , we define

                                       
       () 
                                    ()  =  () .
                                             

As before, we often write          

                                      () .

The number     is called the Riemann integral of  , or sometimes simply the integral of  .

    By definition, a Riemann integrable function is bounded. Appealing to Proposition 5.1.8,
we immediately obtain the following proposition. See also Figure 5.3.

Proposition 5.1.10. Let  : [, ]   be a Riemann integrable function. Let ,    be such
that    ()   for all   [, ]. Then

                                                    
                                       ( - )    ( - ).

                                                                             

A weaker form of this proposition is often useful: If  ()   for all   [, ], then

                             
                                     ( - ).

                               
186                                      CHAPTER 5. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Figure 5.3: The area under the curve is bounded from above by the area of the entire rectangle,
( - ), and from below by the area of the shaded part, ( - ).

Example 5.1.11: We integrate constant functions using Proposition 5.1.8. If  ()  for
some constant , then we take  =  = . In inequality (5.2) all the inequalities must be

                                                        
equalities. Thus  is integrable on [, ] and   = ( - ).

Example 5.1.12: Let  : [0, 2]   be defined by

                                                    1 if  < 1,
                                                    
                                              () 1/2 if  = 1,
                                                    0 if  > 1.
We claim  is Riemann integrable and 0  2  = 1.
    Proof: Let 0 <  < 1 be arbitrary. Let  {0, 1 - , 1 + , 2} be a partition. We use the
notation from the definition of the Darboux sums. Then

     1 = inf   () :   [0, 1 - ] = 1,     1 = sup   () :   [0, 1 - ] = 1,
     2 = inf   () :   [1 - , 1 + ] = 0,  2 = sup   () :   [1 - , 1 + ] = 1,
     3 = inf   () :   [1 + , 2] = 0,     3 = sup   () :   [1 + , 2] = 0.

Furthermore, 1 = 1 - , 2 = 2, and 3 = 1 - . See Figure 5.4.
    We compute

                                 3

              (,  ) =  = 1 · (1 - ) + 0 · 2 + 0 · (1 - ) = 1 - ,

                                =1

                                  3

              (,  ) =  = 1 · (1 - ) + 1 · 2 + 0 · (1 - ) = 1 + .

                                 =1

Thus,         2 2

                  -   (,  ) - (,  ) = (1 + ) - (1 - ) = 2.

By Proposition 5.1.8, 0  2   0  2  . As  was arbitrary, 0  2  = 0  2  . So  is Riemann

integrable. Finally,  2

                 1 -  = (,  )    (,  ) = 1 + .

2                                   0          2

Hence, 0  - 1  . As  was arbitrary, we conclude 0  = 1.

    It may be worthwhile to extract part of the technique of the example into a proposition.
Note that (,  ) - (,  ) is exactly the total area of the white part of the rectangles in

Figure 5.1.

Proposition 5.1.13. Let  : [, ]   be a bounded function. Then  is Riemann integrable if
for every  > 0, there exists a partition  of [, ] such that

                                  (,  ) - (,  ) < .

Proof. If for every  > 0 such a  exists, then

                  

                 0   -   (,  ) - (,  ) < .
                                  

Therefore,     =     , and  is integrable. 

Example 5.1.14:  Let us show   1  is integrable on [0, ] for all   > 0.  We will see later that
                              1+
continuous functions are integrable, but let us demonstrate how we do it directly.

    Let  > 0 be given. Take    and let  / form the partition  {0, 1, . . . , }
of [0, ]. Then  = / for all . As  is decreasing, for every subinterval [-1, ],

 = inf 1 1 +  :   [-1, ] = 1 1 +  ,  = sup 1 1 +  :   [-1, ] = 1 1 + - .1
188                                        CHAPTER 5. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Then                                       1 1 + (-1)/ - 1 1 + / =
   (,  ) - (,  ) = ( - ) =                    =  1  1 + 0/ - 1 1 + /

The sum telescopes, the terms successively cancel each other, something we have seen

                                                              2

before. Picking  to be such that (+1) < , the proposition is satisfied, and the function is
integrable.

Remark 5.1.15. A way of thinking of the integral is that it adds up (integrates) lots of local
information--it sums  ()  over all . The integral sign was chosen by Leibniz to be
the long S to mean summation. Unlike derivatives, which are "local," integrals show
up in applications when one wants a "global" answer: total distance travelled, average
temperature, total charge, etc.

5.1.3 More notation

When  :    is defined on a larger set  and [, ]  , we say  is Riemann integrable on

[, ] if the restriction of  to [, ] is Riemann integrable. In this case, we say   R [, ] ,
                 
and we write   to mean the Riemann integral of the restriction of  to [, ].
                                              
It is useful to define the integral   even if   . Suppose  <  and   R [, ] ,
then define
                                           

                                            - .
                                           

For any function  , define    
                                     0.

                                

At times, the variable  may already have some other meaning. When we need to write

down the variable of integration, we may simply use a different letter. For example,

                                           
                                   ()             () .

5.2 Properties of the integral

Note: 2 lectures, integrability of functions with discontinuities can safely be skipped

5.2.1 Additivity

Adding a bunch of things in two parts and then adding those two parts should be the same
as adding everything all at once. The corresponding property for integrals is called the
additive property of the integral. First, we prove the additivity property for the lower and
upper Darboux integrals.

Lemma 5.2.1. Suppose  <  <  and  : [, ]   is a bounded function. Then

                                              

                    = +          and            =  + .
                                                   

Proof. If we have partitions 1 = {0, 1, . . . , } of [, ] and 2 = { , +1, . . . , } of
[, ], then the set  1  2 = {0, 1, . . . , } is a partition of [, ]. We find

                                          

         (,  ) =  =  +                          = (1,  ) + (2,  ).

                  =1    =1                =+1

When we take the supremum of the right-hand side over all 1 and 2, we are taking
a supremum of the left-hand side over all partitions  of [, ] that contain . If  is a
partition of [, ] and  =   {}, then  is a refinement of  and so (,  )  (,  ).
Therefore, taking a supremum only over the  that contain  is sufficient to find the
supremum of (,  ) over all partitions , see Exercise 1.1.9. Finally, recall Exercise 1.2.9 to

compute


      = sup (,  ) :  a partition of [, ]

  

= sup (,  ) :  a partition of [, ],   

= sup (1,  ) + (2,  ) : 1 a partition of [, ], 2 a partition of [, ]

= sup (1,  ) : 1 a partition of [, ]      + sup  (2,  ) : 2 a partition of [, ]
   

=  + .
           

Similarly, for , 1, and 2 as above, we obtain

                                          

         (,  ) =  =  +                          = (1,  ) + (2,  ).

             =1         =1                =+1
192                                             CHAPTER 5. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

We wish to take the infimum on the right over all 1 and 2, and so we are taking the
infimum over all partitions  of [, ] that contain . If  is a partition of [, ] and

 =   {}, then  is a refinement of  and so (,  )  (,  ). Therefore, taking an

infimum only over the  that contain  is sufficient to find the infimum of (,  ) for all .

We obtain            

                                          =  + .              
                                                  

Proposition 5.2.2. Let  <  < . A function  : [, ]   is Riemann integrable if and only if
 is Riemann integrable on [, ] and [, ]. If  is Riemann integrable, then

                     

                                          =  + .
                                                  

Proof. Suppose   R [, ] , then it is bounded and     =     =     . The lemma gives

                  

              =  =  +    +  =  = .
                                                            

Thus the inequality is an equality,

                    

                                      +  =  + .
                                                      

As we also know          and          , we conclude

                                                   

                 =                         and         = .
                                                        

Thus  is Riemann integrable on [, ] and [, ] and the desired formula holds.
    Now assume  is Riemann integrable on [, ] and on [, ]. Again it is bounded, and

the lemma gives

                  

              =  +  =  +  =  +  = .
                                                            

Therefore,  is Riemann integrable on [, ], and the integral is computed as indicated. 

    An easy consequence of the additivity is the following corollary. We leave the details to
the reader as an exercise.

Corollary 5.2.3. If   R [, ] and [, ]  [, ], then the restriction  |[,] is in R [, ] .

5.2.2 Linearity and monotonicity

A sum is a linear function of the summands. So is the integral.

Proposition 5.2.4 (Linearity). Let  and  be in R [, ] and   .

(i)   is in R [, ] and                         

                                   ()  =   () .
                                               

(ii)  +  is in R [, ] and

                                                 

                         () + ()  =  ()  + () .
                                                 

Proof. Let us prove the first item for   0. Let  be a partition of [, ], and  inf  () :
  [-1, ] as usual. As   0, the multiplication by  moves past the infimum,

            inf   () :   [-1, ] =  inf  () :   [-1, ] = .

Therefore,                                   

                    (,   ) =  =   = (,  ).

                           =1              =1

Similarly,

                               (,   ) = (,  ).

Again, as   0, we may move multiplication by  past the supremum. Hence,

              
                     ()  = sup (,   ) :  a partition of [, ]

                

                           = sup (,  ) :  a partition of [, ]

                           =  sup (,  ) :  a partition of [, ]
                               

                           =   () .

                                    

Similarly, we show                         

                                 ()  =   () .
                                             

The conclusion now follows for   0.

To finish the proof of the first item (for  < 0), we need to show that -  is Riemann
                           
integrable and  -  ()  = -   () . The proof of this fact is left as Exercise 5.2.1.
The proof of the second item is left as Exercise 5.2.2. It is not difficult, but it is not as

trivial as it may appear at first glance.                                            
194                                           CHAPTER 5. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

    The second item in the proposition does not hold with equality for the Darboux integrals,
but we do obtain inequalities. The proof of the following proposition is Exercise 5.2.16. It
follows for upper and lower sums on a fixed partition by Exercise 1.3.7, that is, supremum
of a sum is less than or equal to the sum of suprema and similarly for infima.

Proposition 5.2.5. Let  : [, ]   and  : [, ]   be bounded functions. Then

                                                                  

       (  + )   + ,                      and      ( + )   + .
                                                                    

    Adding up smaller numbers should give us a smaller result. That is true for an integral
as well.

Proposition 5.2.6 (Monotonicity). Let  : [, ]   and  : [, ]   be bounded, and
 ()  () for all   [, ]. Then

                                                 

            and                                     .
                                                  

Moreover, if  and  are in R [, ] , then

                           

                                           .
                                              

Proof. Let  = {0, 1, . . . , } be a partition of [, ]. Then let

      inf  () :   [-1, ]                 and  inf () :   [-1, ] .

As  ()  (), then   . Therefore,

                                              

       (,  ) =    = (, ).

         =1                              =1

We take the supremum over all  (see Proposition 1.3.7) to obtain

                           

                                           .
                                              

Similarly, we obtain the same conclusion for the upper integrals. Finally, if  and  are

Riemann integrable all the integrals are equal, and the conclusion follows.  

5.2.3 Continuous functions

Let us show that continuous functions are Riemann integrable. We can even allow some
discontinuities. We start with a function continuous on the whole closed interval [, ].
5.2. PROPERTIES OF THE INTEGRAL                                                                             195

Lemma 5.2.7. If  : [, ]   is a continuous function, then   R [, ] .

Proof. As  is continuous on a closed bounded interval, it is bounded and uniformly

continuous. Given  > 0, find a  > 0 such that            -   <  implies         () -  ()           < .

                                                                                                       -
Let  = {0, 1, . . . , } be a partition of [, ] such that  <  for all  = 1, 2, . . . , .
                                -                         (  -    )+                               [  -1 ,    ],
For example, take    such that     <  , and let                       .  Then  for  all  ,  
                                                         
we have  -    < , and so

                               () -  ()   () -  () <   -  .

As  is continuous on [-1, ], it attains a maximum and a minimum on this interval. Let
 be a point where  attains the maximum and  be a point where  attains the minimum.

Then  () =  and  () =  in the notation from the definition of the integral. Therefore,

                                 -  =  () -  () <   -  .

And so

                         

                               -   (,  ) - (,  )
                                   

                                                                  

                                           =         -              

                                                =1              =1

                                                

                                           = ( - )

                                              =1

                                           <        

                                                       
                                               -  =1
                                           =  ( - ) = .
                                              -

As  > 0 was arbitrary,                      

                                                   = ,
                                                       

and  is Riemann integrable on [, ].                                                                         

The second lemma says that we need the function to only be "Riemann integrable inside

the interval," as long as it is bounded. It also tells us how to compute the integral.

Lemma   5.2.8.  Let  :  [, ]         be    a  bounded  function,  {   }       and  {  }        be  sequences

                                                                          =1               =1
such that  <  <  <  for all , with lim  =  and lim  = . Suppose
  R [ , ] for all . Then   R [, ] and

                                                        

                                               = lim      .
                                                     
196                                CHAPTER 5. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Proof. Let  > 0 be a real number such that  ()  . As ( - )  ( - ),

                -( - )  -( - )                   ( - )  ( - ).

                                 
Therefore, the sequence of numbers      =1  is bounded and by Bolzano-Weierstrass
has a convergent subsequence indexed by . Let us call  the limit of the subsequence
   
  =1.
Lemma 5.2.1 says that the lower and upper integral are additive and the hypothesis

says that  is integrable on [ ,  ]. Therefore
                                                

                =      +      +   -( - ) +                            - ( -  ).
                               

We take the limit as  goes to  on the right-hand side,
                                    
                                              - · 0 +  -  · 0 = .

                                                       

Next we use additivity of the upper integral,

                                                

                =      +      +   ( - ) +                             + ( -  ).
                                                     
                                           
We take the same subsequence {   }=1 and take the limit to obtain

                          

                                  · 0 +  +  · 0 = .

                            

Thus     =     =  and hence  is Riemann integrable and     = . In particular, no

matter what subsequence we chose, the  is the same number.

To prove the final statement of the lemma we use Proposition 2.3.7. We have shown that
                                                     
every convergent subsequence   =1 converges to  =   . Therefore, the sequence
   
                                 
  =1 is convergent and converges to   .                                          

    We say a function  : [, ]   has finitely many discontinuities if there exists a finite set
 = {1, 2, . . . , }  [, ], and  is continuous at all points of [, ] \ .

Theorem 5.2.9. Let  : [, ]   be a bounded function with finitely many discontinuities.
Then   R [, ] .

Proof. We divide the interval into finitely many intervals [ , ] so that  is continuous on
the interior ( , ). If  is continuous on ( , ), then it is continuous and hence integrable
on [ , ] whenever  <  <  < . By Lemma 5.2.8, the restriction of  to [ , ] is

intervals.

5.2.4 More on integrable functions

Sometimes it is convenient (or necessary) to change certain values of a function and then
integrate. The next result says that if we change the values at finitely many points, the
integral does not change.

Proposition 5.2.10. Let  : [, ]   be Riemann integrable. Let  : [, ]   be such that
 () = () for all   [, ] \ , where  is a finite set. Then  is Riemann integrable and

                      

                                    = .
                                     

Sketch of proof. Using additivity of the integral, split the interval [, ] into smaller intervals

such that  () = () holds for all  except at the endpoints (details are left to the reader).

Therefore, without loss of generality suppose  () = () for all   (, ). The proof

follows by Lemma 5.2.8, and is left as Exercise 5.2.3.    

    Finally, monotone (increasing or decreasing) functions are always Riemann integrable.
The proof is left to the reader as part of Exercise 5.2.14.

Proposition 5.2.11. Let  : [, ]   be a monotone function. Then   R [, ] .

Hint: One way to do it is to use Proposition 5.1.7 to find a single partition  such that (,  ) - (,  ) < /2

                                             =  + .

               () 1/ if  = / where ,    and  and  have no common divisors,
                           0 if  is irrational.

Show 0  1  = 0.
    If    is a bounded interval, then the function

                                        ()  1 if   ,
                                            0 otherwise,

function  is integrable on [, ], and find the integral in terms of , , and the endpoints of .

    A function  is called a step function if it can be written as

5.3 Fundamental theorem of calculus

Note: 1.5 lectures

    In this section we discuss and prove the fundamental theorem of calculus. The entirety
of integral calculus is built upon this theorem, ergo the name. The theorem relates the
seemingly unrelated concepts of integral and derivative. It tells us how to compute the
antiderivative of a function using the integral and vice versa.

5.3.1 First form of the theorem

Theorem 5.3.1. Let  : [, ]   be a continuous function, differentiable on (, ). Let
  R [, ] be such that  () = () for   (, ). Then

                                           
                                                     = () - ().

                                                                 

    It is not hard to generalize the theorem to allow a finite number of points in [, ] where
 is not differentiable, as long as it is continuous. This generalization is left as an exercise.

Proof. Let  = {0, 1, . . . , } be a partition of [, ]. For each interval [-1, ], use the
mean value theorem to find a   (-1, ) such that

                               () = ()( - -1) = () - (-1).

See Figure 5.5, and notice that the area of the th rectangle is (+1) - (-2) for all three
rectangles. The idea is that by taking smaller and smaller subintervals we prove that this
area is the integral of  .

     ( -1)                   = ( ) = ( )    area = ( +1) +1
       ()                                         = ( +1) - ( )

            area = ( -1) -1 area = ( )

     ( +1)  = ( -1) - ( -2)  = ( ) - ( -1)

            -2 -1            -1             +1                   +1

                         -1                  +1

the curve.
5.3. FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS                                               201

    Using the notation from the definition of the integral,    ()  , and multiplying
by  gets

                                       () - (-1)   .

We sum over  = 1, 2, . . . ,  to get

                                                                                

                                                 () - (-1)                 .

                        =1                   =1                               =1

In the middle sum, all the terms except the first and last cancel and we end up with
() - (0) = () - (). The sums on the left and on the right are the lower and the

upper sum respectively. So

                            (,  )  () - ()  (,  ).

We take the supremum of (,  ) over all partitions  and the left inequality yields

                                            
                                                     () - ().

                                                                 

Similarly, taking the infimum of (,  ) over all partitions  yields

                                                              
                                             () - ()   .

                                                                        

As  is Riemann integrable, we have

                                                             

                             =   () - ()   =  .
                                                                          

The inequalities must be equalities and we are done.                               

    The theorem is used to compute integrals. Suppose we know that the function  () is a
                                                                                                        

derivative of some other function (), then we can find an explicit expression for   .

5.3.2 Second form of the theorem

The second form of the fundamental theorem gives us a way to solve the differential
equation () =  (), where  is a known function and we are trying to find an  that
satisfies the equation.

Theorem 5.3.3. Let  : [, ]   be a Riemann integrable function. Define

                                      

                                ()                      .

First,  is continuous on [, ]. Second, if  is continuous at   [, ], then  is differentiable at
 and () =  ().

Proof. As  is bounded, there is an  > 0 such that  ()   for all   [, ]. Suppose
,   [, ] with  > . Then

                                                           

                   () - () =    -  =                           - .
                                    

By symmetry, the same also holds if  < . So  is Lipschitz continuous and hence

continuous.
    Now suppose  is continuous at . Let  > 0 be given. Let  > 0 be such that for

  [, ], | - | <  implies  () -  () < . In particular, for such , we have

                    () -  <  () <  () + .

Thus if  > , then

                                                         () +  ( - ).
                    () -  ( - )   

                                                      

When  > , then the inequalities are reversed. Therefore, assuming   , we get
                                        () -         () + .
                                                       -

As                 () - () =     -     =     ,
we have            -                  -                      -

                              () - ()  -  -  ()  .

The result follows. It is left to the reader to see why is it OK that we just have a non-strict

inequality.                                                                   
5.3. FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS                                                   203

    Of course, if  is continuous on [, ], then it is automatically Riemann integrable,  is
differentiable on all of [, ] and () =  () for all   [, ].

Remark 5.3.4. The second form of the fundamental theorem of calculus still holds if we let

  [, ] and define  

()                   .

That is, we can use any point of [, ] as our base point. The proof is left as an exercise.

Let us look at what a simple discontinuity can do. Take  ()       -1 if  < 0, and

                                                   
 () 1 if   0. Let () 0  . It is not difficult to see that () = ||. Notice that  is
discontinuous at 0 and  is not differentiable at 0. However, the converse in the theorem

                                                                                                                                   
does not hold. Let () 0 if   0, and (0) 1. Letting () 0 , we find that
() = 0 for all . So  is discontinuous at 0, but (0) exists and is equal to 0.

A common misunderstanding of the integral for calculus students is to think of integrals

whose solution cannot be given in closed-form as somehow deficient. This is not the case.

Most integrals we write down are not computable in closed-form. Even some integrals

that we consider in closed-form are not really such. We define the natural logarithm as the
antiderivative of 1/ such that ln 1 = 0:

  ln  1 .
           1

How does a computer find the value of ln ? One way todo it is to numerically approximate

                                                                                                     1

this integral. Morally, we did not really "simplify" 1   by writing down ln . We
simply gave the integral a name. If we require numerical answers, it is possible we end up

doing the calculation by approximating an integral anyway. In the next section, we even

define the exponential using the logarithm, which we define in terms of the integral.

Another common function defined by an integral that cannot be evaluated symbolically

in terms of elementary functions is the erf function, defined as

erf()  2 -2  
                      .
       0

This function comes up often in applied mathematics. It is simply the antiderivative of
(2/) -2 that is zero at zero. The second form of the fundamental theorem tells us that
we can write the function as an integral. If we wish to compute any particular value, we
numerically approximate the integral.

5.3.3 Change of variables

A theorem often used in calculus to solve integrals is the change of variables theorem, you
may have called it -substitution. Let us prove it now. Recall a function is continuously
differentiable if it is differentiable and the derivative is continuous.
204                                    CHAPTER 5. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Theorem 5.3.5 (Change of variables). Let  : [, ]   be a continuously differentiable

function, let  : [, ]   be continuous, and suppose  [, ]  [, ]. Then

             () ()  =                              ()

                                                  ()    () .

Proof. As , , and  are continuous,  () () is a continuous function of [, ],

therefore it is Riemann integrable. Similarly,  is integrable on every subinterval of [, ].

Define  : [, ]   by  

                               ()            () .

                                       ()

By the second form of the fundamental theorem of calculus (see Remark 5.3.4 and
Exercise 5.3.4),  is a differentiable function and () =  (). Apply the chain rule,

             () =  () () =  () ().

Note that  () = 0 and use the first form of the fundamental theorem to obtain

      ()

     ()    ()  =  () =  () -  ()

                                 =    ()  =  ()    () . 
                                                       

The change of variables theorem is often used to solve integrals by changing them to

integrals that we know or that we can solve using the fundamental theorem of calculus.

Example 5.3.6: The derivative of sin() is cos(). Using () 2, we solve
      cos(2  )  = cos    ()  = 1   cos()  = sin() - sin(0) = 0.
            02                         20                     2
     0

However, beware that we must satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem. The following

example demonstrates why we should not just move symbols around mindlessly. We must

be careful that those symbols really make sense.

Example 5.3.7: Consider             1 ln || .
It may be tempting to take ()        -1 

                               ln ||. Compute () = 1/ and try to write

                                (1)    0

                               (-1)    =   = 0.

                                       0

This "solution" is incorrect, and it does not say that we can solve the given integral. First

                            ln||

problem is that  is not continuous on [-1, 1]. It is not defined at 0, and cannot be made

                                                                                ln||

continuous by defining a value at 0. Second,  is not even Riemann integrable on [-1, 1]
(it is unbounded). The integral we wrote down simply does not make sense. Finally,  is
not continuous on [-1, 1], let alone continuously differentiable.

5.4 The logarithm and the exponential

Note: 1 lecture (optional, requires the optional sections §3.5, §3.6, §4.4)

We now have the tools required to properly define the exponential and the logarithm

that you know from calculus so well. We start with exponentiation. If  is a positive integer,

it is obvious to define           ·  · · · · ·  .

                                                                                 times

It makes sense to define 0 1. For negative integers, let - 1/. If  > 0, define 1/
as the unique positive th root. Finally, for a rational number / (in lowest terms), define

                                                / 1/  .

It is not difficult to show we get the same number no matter what representation of / we
use, so we do not need to use lowest terms.

                                               2  
    However, what do we mean by 2 ? Or  in general? In particular, what is  for
all ? And how do we solve  =  for ? This section answers these questions and more.

5.4.1 The logarithm

It is convenient to define the logarithm first. Let us show that a unique function with the
right properties exists, and only then will we call it the logarithm.
Proposition 5.4.1. There exists a unique function  : (0, )   such that

   (i) (1) = 0.
  (ii)  is differentiable and () = 1/.
 (iii)  is strictly increasing, bective, and

                         lim () = -, and lim () = .
                         0                         

(iv) ( ) = () + () for all ,   (0, ).
(v) If  is a rational number and  > 0, then () = ().

Proof. To prove existence, we define a candidate and show it satisfies all the properties. Let
                                               () 1 .
                                                            1

Obviously, (i) holds. Property (ii) holds via the second form of the fundamental theorem

of calculus (Theorem 5.3.3).

To prove property (iv), we change variables  =  to obtain

  () = 1    = 1    = 1    - 1  = ( ) - ().
1                               1                  1
208                                      CHAPTER 5. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Let us prove (iii). Property (ii) together with the fact that () = 1/ > 0 for  > 0,

implies that  is strictly increasing and hence one-to-one. Let us show  is onto. As 1/  1/2

when   [1, 2],      2 (2) = 1   1/2.
                             1

By induction, (iv) implies that for   ,

                (2) = (2) + (2) + · · · + (2) = (2).

Given  > 0, by the Archimedean property of the real numbers (notice (2) > 0), there is
an    such that (2) > . The intermediate value theorem gives an 1  (1, 2) such
that (1) = . Thus (0, ) is in the image of . As  is increasing, () >  for all  > 2,
and so

                                                  lim () = .

                                                                   

Next 0 = (/) = () + (1/), and so () = -(1/). Using  = 2-, we obtain as above
that  achieves all negative numbers. And

                lim () = lim -(1/) = lim -() = -.
                0  0                     

In the limits, note that only  > 0 are in the domain of .
    Let us prove (v). Fix  > 0. As above, (iv) implies () = () for all   . We

already found that () = -(1/), so (-) = -() = -(). Then for   

                   () =  (1/) =  1/ .

Putting everything together for    and   , we have (/) = (1/) = (/)().
    Uniqueness follows using properties (i) and (ii). Via the first form of the fundamental

theorem of calculus (Theorem 5.3.1),

                                                () = 1 
                                                            1

is the unique function such that (1) = 0 and () = 1/.  

    Having proved that there is a unique function with these properties, we simply define
the logarithm or sometimes called the natural logarithm:

                                                  ln() ().

See Figure 5.6. Mathematicians usually write log() instead of ln(), which is more familiar
to calculus students. For all practical purposes, there is only one logarithm: the natural
logarithm. See Exercise 5.4.2.

5.4.2 The exponential

Just as with the logarithm we define the exponential via a list of properties.

Proposition 5.4.2. There exists a unique function  :   (0, ) such that

(i) (0) = 1.
(ii)  is differentiable and () = ().

(iii)  is strictly increasing, bective, and

   lim () = 0, and lim () = .
   -                                               

(iv) ( + ) = ()() for all ,   .
(v) If   , then () = ().

Proof. Again, we prove existence of such a function by defining a candidate and proving
that it satisfies all the properties. The  = ln defined above is invertible. Let  be the
inverse function of . Property (i) is immediate.

    Property (ii) follows via the inverse function theorem, in particular via Lemma 4.4.1:
 satisfies all the hypotheses of the lemma, and hence

                       () = 1  () = ().

    Let us look at property (iii). The function  is strictly increasing since () = () > 0.
As  is the inverse of , it must also be bective. To find the limits, we use that  is strictly
increasing and onto (0, ). For every  > 0, there is an 0 such that (0) =  and
()   for all   0. Similarly, for every  > 0, there is an 0 such that (0) =  and
() <  for all  < 0. Therefore,

lim () = 0, and lim () = .
-                                                  
210                                               CHAPTER 5. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

    To prove property (iv), we use the corresponding property for the logarithm. Take
,   . As  is bective, find  and  such that  = () and  = (). Then

                ( + ) =  () + () =  () =  = ()().

    Property (v) also follows from the corresponding property of . Given   , let  be
such that  = () and

                               () =  () =  () =  = ().

Uniqueness follows from (i) and (ii). Let  and  be two functions satisfying (i) and (ii).

            ()(-) = ()(-) - (-)() = ()(-) - (-)() = 0.

Therefore, by Proposition 4.2.6, ()(-) = (0)(-0) = 1 for all   . Next, 1 = (0) =
( - ) = ()(-). Then

             0 = 1 - 1 = ()(-) - ()(-) = () - () (-).

Finally, (-)  0 for all   . So () - () = 0 for all , and we are done.                     

Having proved  is unique, we define the exponential function (see Figure 5.7) as

                                      exp() ().

                                      4
                                      3

equation     =    means  that    =    follows  these  slopes.
          

      is a function into (0, ) after all. However, (-)  0 also follows from ()(-) = 1. Therefore, we
can prove uniqueness of  given (i) and (ii), even for functions  :   .
5.4. THE LOGARITHM AND THE EXPONENTIAL                                                            211

     If    and  > 0, then

                             = exp ln() = exp  ln() .

We can now make sense of exponentiation  for arbitrary   ; if  > 0 and  is irrational,

define                                 exp  ln() .

As exp is continuous, then  is a continuous function of . Therefore, we would obtain
                                                                       {  }
the  same  result  had  we  taken  a  sequence  of  rational  numbers              approaching    and
defined  = lim  .                                                              =1

     Define the number , called Euler's number or the base of the natural logarithm, as

                                                    exp(1).
Let us justify the notation  for exp():

                                          = exp  ln() = exp().

    The properties of the logarithm and the exponential extend to irrational powers. The
proof is immediate.

Proposition 5.4.3. Let ,   .
   (i) exp( ) = exp() .
  (ii) If  > 0, then ln() =  ln().

Remark 5.4.4. There are other equivalent ways to define the exponential and the logarithm.
A common way is to define  as the solution to the differential equation () = (),
(0) = 1. See Example 6.3.3, for a sketch of that approach. Yet another approach is to
define the exponential function by power series, see Example 6.2.14.
Remark 5.4.5. We proved the uniqueness of the functions  and  from just the properties
(1) = 0, () = 1/ and the equivalent condition for the exponential () = (), (0) = 1.
Existence also follows from just these properties. Alternatively, uniqueness also follows
from the laws of exponents, see the exercises.

5.5 Improper integrals

Note: 2-3 lectures (optional section, can safely be skipped, requires the optional §3.5)

    Often it is necessary to integrate over the entire real line, or an unbounded interval of
the form [, ) or (-, ]. We may also wish to integrate unbounded functions defined
on an open bounded interval (, ). For such intervals or functions, the Riemann integral

is not defined, but we will write down the integral anyway in the spirit of Lemma 5.2.8.

These integrals are called improper integrals and are limits of integrals rather than integrals

themselves.

Definition 5.5.1. Suppose  : [, )   is a function (not necessarily bounded) that is
Riemann integrable on [, ] for all  < . We define

                                                                  
                                                             lim 

                                                             - 

if the limit exists.

Suppose  : [, )   is a function such that  is Riemann integrable on [, ] for all

 < . We define                                                     

                                                             lim 

                                                              

if the limit exists.

If the limit exists, we say the improper integral converges. If the limit does not exist, we

say the improper integral diverges.

We similarly define improper integrals for the left-hand endpoint, we leave this to the

reader.

    For a finite endpoint , if  is bounded, then Lemma 5.2.8 says that we defined nothing
new. What is new is that we can apply this definition to unbounded functions. The
following set of examples is so useful that we state it as a proposition.

Proposition 5.5.2 (-test for integrals). The improper integral
                                                   1 
                                                      1 

converges  to   1  if     >  1  and   diverges  if  0  <       1.
               -1

The improper integral                                   1 1 
                                                        0 

converges  to   1  if  0  <     <  1  and  diverges    if      1.
               1-

Proof. The proof follows by application of the fundamental theorem of calculus. Let us do
the proof for  > 1 for the infinite right endpoint and leave the rest to the reader. Hint:
You should handle  = 1 separately.
5.5. IMPROPER INTEGRALS                                                                                    215

    Suppose  > 1. Then using the fundamental theorem,

               1    = -  = -+1 - 1-+1 = -1 + 1 .
             1  1                                - + 1 - + 1 ( - 1)-1  - 1

As    >  1,  then    -  1  >  0.  Take  the  limit  as          to  obtain  that    1   goes  to  0.  The  result
                                                                                    -1
follows.                                                                                                   

    We state the following proposition on "tails" for just one type of improper integral,
though the proof is straightforward and the same for other types of improper integrals.

Proposition 5.5.3. Let  : [, )   be a function that is Riemann integrable on [, ] for all
                                                                            
 > . For every  > , the integral   converges if and only if   converges, in which case

                                          

                                                  =  + .
                                                                

Proof. Let  > . Then                      

                                                  =  + .
                                                                

Taking the limit    finishes the proof.                                                                    

    Nonnegative functions are easier to work with as the following proposition demon-
strates. The exercises will show that this proposition holds only for nonnegative functions.
Analogues of this proposition exist for all the other types of improper limits and are left to
the student.

Proposition 5.5.4. Suppose  : [, )   is nonnegative (  ()  0 for all ) and  is Riemann
integrable on [, ] for all  > .

(i)    

                                                  = sup          : .

                                                                            
(ii) Suppose {}=1 is a sequence with lim  = . Then   converges if and only if
              
      lim   exists, in which case

                                                                 

                                                         = lim      .
                                                           

    In the first item we allow for the value of  in the supremum indicating that the integral

diverges to infinity.

Proof. We start with the first item. As  is nonnegative,     is increasing as a function of
                                                                                              
. If the supremum is infinite, then for every    we find  such that    . As
                                                          
  is increasing,     for all   . So   diverges to infinity.

    Next suppose the supremum is finite, say  sup     :    . For every  > 0, we
find an  such that  -     < . As     is increasing, then  -     <  for all   
             
and hence   converges to .   
    Let us look at the second item. If   converges, then every sequence {}=1 going
to  infinity  works.  The    trick  is  proving  the   other  direction.  Suppose     {   }       is  such  that

lim  =  and                                                                                   =1

                                                          =

                                              lim

                                               
converges. Given  > 0, pick  such that for all   , we have  -  <     <  + .
      
Because   is increasing as a function of , we have that for all   
                                                                

                                         - <               .
                                                                  

As  {   }       goes  to  ,  then   for  any  given  ,   there  is  an    such  that              and       .

            =1
Then
                                                  

                                                          <  + .

                                              
In particular, for all    , we have   -  < .                                                                

Proposition 5.5.5 (Comparison test for improper integrals). Let  : [, )   and

 : [, )   be functions that are Riemann integrable on [, ] for all  > . Suppose

that for all   ,

                                                  ()  ().

(i) If     converges, then     converges, and in this case                          .
(ii) If     diverges, then     diverges.

Proof. We start with the first item. For every  and , such that     , we have

-()   ()  (), and so                                  
                                        

                                              -    .
                                                                  

In other words,         .

    Let  > 0 be given. Because of Proposition 5.5.3,

                                           

                                               =  + .
                                                                
As     goes to     as  goes to infinity,     goes to 0 as  goes to infinity. Choose 
such that
                                                 

                                                      < .

                                                 
5.5. IMPROPER INTEGRALS                                                                       217

                                                                          
As  is nonnegative, if    < , then   <  as well. Let {}=1 be a sequence going
to infinity. Let  be such that    for all   . Take ,   , with   ,

                                 -            =                    < .

                                                              

Therefore, the sequence     =1  is Cauchy and hence converges.
  We  need  to  show  that  the  limit  is  unique.  Suppose  {   }       is  a  sequence  converging
                           
                                                                      =1
to infinity such that   =1 converges to 1, and {}=1 is a sequence converging
                              
to infinity such that   =1 converges to 2. Then there must be some  such that
                       
  - 1 <  and   - 2 < . We can also suppose    and   . Then

  |1 - 2|  1 -              +             -       +            - 2 <  +              +  < 3.

                                                                                 

As  > 0 was arbitrary, 1 = 2, and hence     converges. Above we have shown that
      
     for all  > . By taking the limit   , the first item is proved.

  The second item is simply a contrapositive of the first item.                               

Example 5.5.6: The improper integral

                                      sin(2)( + 2) 
                                                3 + 1
                                        0

converges.

    Proof: Observe we simply need to show that the integral converges when going from 1
to infinity. For   1 we obtain

                      3 sin(2)( + 2) + 1  3 + 2 + 1  3  + 2  3  + 2  23 .

Then                             3                1

                                 1 2         = 3     1   2  = 3.

So using the comparison test and the tail test, the original integral converges.

Example 5.5.7: You should be careful when doing formal manipulations with improper

integrals. The integral                       2 
                                             2 2 - 1

converges via the comparison test using 1/2 again. However, if you succumb to the

temptation to write

                                    2 2- 1 = 1  - 1 - 1  + 1
218                                       CHAPTER 5. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

and try to integrate each part separately, you will not succeed. It is not true that you can
split the improper integral in two; you cannot split the limit.

                 2                   2
                             = lim        2 
                2 2 - 1      2  - 1
                                                
                                          1  -         1 
                            = lim   2 -1  2 +1
                            

                            
                             1  - 1 .
                                    2 -1     2 +1

The last line in the computation does not even make sense. Both of the integrals diverge to
infinity, since we can apply the comparison test appropriately with 1/. We get  - .

Now suppose we need to take limits at both endpoints.

if the limits exist.

    Suppose  :    is a function such that  is Riemann integrable on all bounded
intervals [, ]. Then we define

                                             
                                  
                                    lim lim     
                              -     -  

if the limits exist.
    We similarly define improper integrals with one infinite and one finite improper

endpoint, we leave this to the reader.

    One ought to always be careful about double limits. The definition given above says
that we first take the limit as  goes to  or  for a fixed , and then we take the limit in .

We will have to prove that in this case it does not matter which limit we compute first.

Example 5.5.9:

      1          = lim lim   1      2  = lim lim arctan() - arctan() = .

     - 1 + 2    -   1 +                   - 

    In the definition, the order of the limits can always be switched if they exist. Let us
state and prove this fact only for the limits at infinity.

Proposition 5.5.10. Suppose  :    is integrable on every bounded interval [, ]. Then

                                                                             

        lim lim           converges     if and only if          lim lim                  converges,
      -                                                          - 

in which case the two expressions are equal. If either of the expressions converges, then the improper

integral converges and                     

                                     lim        =            .
                                      -                   -

Proof. Without loss of generality, assume  < 0 and  > 0. Suppose the first expression
converges. Then

                                        0                              0

                                        0           0                           0 

                          = lim    lim        +  = lim lim                               +  .
                                   -                               -               
                                                       0                                      0

Similar computation shows the other direction. Therefore, if either expression converges,
then the improper integral converges and

                                                                                0

                                                                                                           

Example 5.5.11: On the other hand, you must be careful to take the limits independently
                                                
before  you  know  convergence.    Let   ()  =  ||  for        0  and   (0)  =  0.   If    <  0  and    >  0,

then                              0 

                                      =  +  =  + .
                                          
                                                       0

For every fixed  < 0, the limit as    is infinite. So even the first limit does not exist,

                                                   

and the improper integral -  does not converge. On the other hand, if  > 0, then

                                     
                                            = (-) +  = 0.

                                       -

Therefore,                                   
                                        lim  = 0.

Example 5.5.12: An example to keep in mind for improper integrals is the so-called sinc
function. This function comes up quite often in both pure and applied mathematics. Define

Figure 5.8: The sinc function.

It is not difficult to show that the sinc function is continuous at zero, but that is not

important right now. What is important is that

                                          while            
                  sinc()  = ,                                    |sinc()|  = .

              -                                              -

The integral of the sinc function is a continuous analogue of the alternating harmonic
            (-1)/,                                                                          1/.
series  =1          while  the  absolute  value  is  like  the  regular  harmonic  series
                                                                                           =1

In particular, the fact that the integral converges must be done directly rather than using

comparison test.

We will not prove the first statement exactly. Let us simply prove that the integral of the
                                                                                   sin(-) sin()
sinc function converges, but we will not worry about the exact limit. Because - =  ,
it is enough to show that
                                          sin()
                                          2  

converges. We also avoid  = 0 this way to make our life simpler.

For every   , we have that for   [2, (2 + 1)],

Similarly,                  -2  (2+2)  sin()   -1 .

                          (2 + 1) (2+1)                       ( + 1)

As  goes to infinity, the first term on the right-hand side goes to , and the second term

on the right-hand side goes to zero. Hence

    The double-sided integral of sinc also exists as noted above. We leave the other
statement--that the integral of the absolute value of the sinc function diverges--as an
exercise.

5.5.1 Integral test for series

The fundamental theorem of calculus can be used in proving a series is summable and to
estimate its sum.

Proposition 5.5.13 (Integral test). Suppose  : [, )   is a decreasing nonnegative function
where   . Then

                          converges      if and only if          converges.
                                                               
                      ()
                                                           
                =

In this case                                             

                                ()   () +  .

additional hypotheses of integrability.

rectangles,  (2) +  (3) +  (4) + · · · , and bounded above by the area entire rectangles,  (1) +
 (2) +  (3) + · · · .

    Suppose first that     converges and let  > 0 be given. As before, since  is positive,
                                                              

then there exists an    such that if   , then   < /2 for all    . The function 
must decrease to zero (why?), so make  large enough so that for   , we have  ( ) < /2.

Thus, for  >   , we have via (5.3),

                                     

       ()   ( ) +                           < /2 + /2 = .

   =

The series is therefore Cauchy and thus converges. The estimate in the proposition is

obtained by letting  go to infinity in (5.3) with  = .

                                                

    Conversely, suppose   diverges. As  is positive, then by Proposition 5.5.4, the
              

sequence {   }= diverges to infinity. Using (5.3) with  = , we find

                                           -1

                                        ().

                                           =

As the left-hand side goes to infinity as   , so does the right-hand side.                        

Example 5.5.14: The integral test can be used not only to show that a series converges, but
                                                         
to estimate its sum to arbitrary precision. Let us show  =1  1  exists  and  estimate  its  sum
                                                             2
to within 0.01. As this series is the -series for  = 2, we already proved it converges (let us

pretend we do not know that), but we only roughly estimated its sum.

The fundamental theorem of calculus says that for all   ,
                           1  = 1 .
                                      2        

In particular, the series must converge. But we also have

1 1                                  1 1 1                      11
=     2                              2 2+                  2  = 2 + .
                         =

Adding the partial sum up to  - 1 we get

                              1 -1 + 1   1  1 + 1 -1 + 1 .
                               =1 2 =1 2 2  =1 2

In other words, 1/ +          -1 1/2    is  an  estimate     for  the  sum  to     within  1/2.  Therefore,           if  we

                              =1
wish to find the sum to within 0.01, we note 1/102 = 0.01. We obtain

                              1 9 1 1 1 1 9 1
             1.6397 . . .  +                2            2 + +                          2  1.6497 . . . .
                           10 =1  =1  100 10 =1 

The actual sum is 2/6  1.6449 . . ..

Sequences of Functions

6.1 Pointwise and uniform convergence

Note: 1-1.5 lecture

    Up till now, when we talked about limits of sequences we talked about sequences
of numbers. A very useful concept in analysis is a sequence of functions. For example,
a solution to some differential equation might be found by finding only approximate
solutions. Then the actual solution is some sort of limit of those approximate solutions.

    When talking about sequences of functions, the tricky part is that there are multiple
notions of a limit. Let us describe two common notions of a limit of a sequence of functions.

6.1.1 Pointwise convergence

Definition 6.1.1.  For every     , let   :     be a function.                    The  sequence    {   }

converges pointwise to  :    if for every   , we have                                                     =1

                                  () = lim ().

                                             

Limits  of  sequences  of  numbers  are  unique,  and  so  if  a  sequence            {   }       converges

                                                                                              =1
pointwise, the limit function  is unique. It is common to say that  :    converges
pointwise to  on    for some  :   . In that case we mean  () = lim () for
every   . In other words, the restrictions of  to  converge pointwise to  .

Example 6.1.2: On [-1, 1], the sequence of functions defined by ()                       2 converges
pointwise to  : [-1, 1]  , where

                            () = 1 if  = -1 or  = 1,
                                     0 otherwise.

See Figure 6.1.

     Unless otherwise specified, converges generally means converges pointwise.

                                                         2  4           6 16

Figure 6.1: Graphs of 1, 2, 3, and 8 for () 2.

To see this is so, first take   (-1, 1). Then 0  2 < 1. We have seen before that
                                2 - 0 = (2)  0 as   .

Therefore, lim () = 0.
    When  = 1 or  = -1, then 2 = 1 for all  and hence lim () = 1. For all other

                                          

, the sequence () =1 does not converge.

    Often, functions are given as a series. In this case, we use the notion of pointwise
convergence to find the values of the function.

Example 6.1.3: We write                         
to denote the limit of the functions
                                                   

                                               =0

                                           ()       

                                                       .

                                                   =0

When studying series, we saw that for (-1, 1) the  converge pointwise to

                                               1 1 -  .

The  subtle  point  here  is  that  while   1  is  defined  for  all      1,  and    are  defined  for  all
                                           1-
 (even at  = 1), convergence only happens on (-1, 1). Therefore, when we write

                                            ()      

                                                       

                                                   =0

we mean that  is defined on (-1, 1) and is the pointwise limit of the partial sums.
6.1. POINTWISE AND UNIFORM CONVERGENCE                                                                  229

Example 6.1.4: Let () sin(). Then  does not converge pointwise to any function
on any interval. It may converge at certain points, such as when  = 0 or  = . It is left as
an exercise that in any interval [, ], there exists an  such that sin() does not have a

limit as  goes to infinity. See Figure 6.2.

Figure 6.2: Graphs of sin() for  = 1, 2, . . . , 10, with higher  in lighter gray.

    Before we move to uniform convergence, let us reformulate pointwise convergence in a
different way. We leave the proof to the reader--it is a simple application of the definition
of convergence of a sequence of real numbers.

Proposition 6.1.5. Let  :    and  :    be functions.                              Then  { }             converges

                                                                                               =1
pointwise to  if and only if for every    and every  > 0, there exists an    such that

                                     () -  () <  for all    .

    The key point is that  can depend on , not just on . For each , we can pick a different
. If we could pick one  for all , we would have what is called uniform convergence.

6.1.2 Uniform convergence

Definition  6.1.6.    Let     :          and      :        be  functions.    The  sequence  {   }       converges

                                                                                                    =1
uniformly to  if for every  > 0, there exists an    such that for all   ,

                                    () -  () <  for all   .

    In uniform convergence,  cannot depend on . Given  > 0, we must find an 
that works for all   . See Figure 6.3 for an illustration. Uniform convergence implies

pointwise convergence, and the proof follows by Proposition 6.1.5:

Proposition      6.1.7.  Let  { }        be  a  sequence   of  functions   :   .  If    { }             converges

                                     =1                                                        =1
uniformly  to    :         ,  then  { }         converges  pointwise  to  .

                                           =1

The converse does not hold.

                            -

Figure 6.3: In uniform convergence, for   , the functions  are within a strip of ± from  .

Example 6.1.8: The functions () 2 do not converge uniformly on [-1, 1], even

though they converge pointwise. To see this, suppose for contradiction that the convergence
is uniform. For  1/2, there would have to exist an  such that 2 = 2 - 0 < 1/2 for

all   (-1, 1) (as () converges to 0 on (-1, 1)). But that means that for every sequence
{   }           (-1, 1)                                         2      1/2
            in           such  that  lim    =   1,  we    have      <       for  all  .  On  the  other  hand,
        =1                                                        
2 is a continuous function of  (it is a polynomial). Therefore, we obtain a contradiction

                                        1 = 12 = lim 2  1/2.

                                                           

However,        if  we   restrict  our  domain  to  [- ,  ]  where  0  <    <  1,  then  {   }       converges

                                                                                                 =1
uniformly to 0 on [-, ]. Note that 2  0 as   . Given  > 0, pick    such that
2 <  for all   . If   [-, ], then ||  . So for all    and all   [-, ],

                                        2 = ||2  2 < .

6.1.3 Convergence in uniform norm

For bounded functions, there is another more abstract way to think of uniform convergence.
To every bounded function we assign a certain nonnegative number that measures the
"distance" of the function from the constant function 0. This number allows us to "measure"
how far two functions are from each other. We then translate a statement about uniform
convergence into a statement about a certain sequence of real numbers converging to zero.

Definition 6.1.9. Let  :    be a bounded function. Define

                                            sup  () :    .

We call · the uniform norm. Sometimes other notation is used, such as   .

     The notation nor terminology is not completely standardized. The norm is also called the sup norm or
infinity norm, and in addition to    and    it is sometimes written as    or   ,.
6.1. POINTWISE AND UNIFORM CONVERGENCE                                                                                 231

The subscript is the set over which the supremum is taken. So if    then

                                                   = sup  () :    .

Proposition 6.1.10. A sequence of bounded functions  :    converges uniformly to  :

                                               lim   -   = 0.

                                                                

Proof. First suppose lim  -   = 0. Let  > 0 be given. There exists an  such that
for   , we have   -   < . As  -   is the supremum of () -  () , we see
that for all   , we have () -  ()    -   < .
                                                  { }
On          the  other     hand,      suppose                converges    uniformly      to     .    Let   >    0 be given.
                                                         =1
Then find  such that for all   , we have () -  () <  for all   . Taking the
supremum over   , we see that   -    . Hence lim  -   = 0.
                                                                                                                         

Sometimes              it  is  said   that  { }          converges  to    in  uniform    norm       instead   of  converges

                                                   =1
uniformly if   -    0. The proposition says that the two notions are the same thing

for bounded functions.

                                                                                         +sin(  2 )                    
Example 6.1.11: Let  : [0, 1]   be defined by ()                                          . We claim { }=1
converges uniformly to  () . Let us compute:

                                -  [0,1] = sup              + sin(2)  -  :   [0, 1]
                                             = sup         sin(2) :   [0, 1]

                                                               

                                                 sup 1/ :   [0, 1]
                                                = 1/.

    Using the uniform norm, we define Cauchy sequences in a similar way as we define
Cauchy sequences of real numbers.

Definition 6.1.12. Let  :    be bounded functions. The sequence is Cauchy in the
uniform norm or uniformly Cauchy if for every  > 0, there exists an    such that for all
,   ,

                                                    -   < .

Proposition      6.1.13.       Let    :              be  bounded  functions.  Then  {   }       is  Cauchy  in  the  uniform
                                                                  { }
            and            there                  :                                         =1       to    .
norm    if       only  if           exists  an               and         =1   converges  uniformly

Proof.  First    suppose       {      }     is Cauchy in the uniform norm.             Let us define        .   Fix .  The
                           
                                        =1
sequence () =1 is Cauchy because

                                                () - ()   -   .

Thus () =1  converges to some real number. Define  :    by

                                                           () lim ().

                                                                       

The   sequence       { }        converges       pointwise           to    .     To  show     that    the    convergence          is  uniform,

                            =1
let  > 0 be given. Find an  such that for all ,   , we have  -   < /2. In other
words, for all , we have () - () < /2. For any fixed , take the limit as  goes to
infinity. Then () - () goes to () -  () . Consequently for all ,

                                                     () -  ()  /2 < .

Hence,  {    }       converges         uniformly.                               { }

                 =1        the   other                          Suppose                =1    converges                               .  Given
Next,       we   prove                     direction.                                                            uniformly    to

 > 0, find  such that for all   , we have () -  () < /4 for all   . Therefore,
for all ,    and all ,

() - () = () -  () +  () - ()
                                                  () -  () +  () - () < /4 + /4 = /2.

Take the supremum over all  to obtain

                                                           -    /2 < .

6.2 Interchange of limits

Note: 1-2.5 lectures, subsections on derivatives and power series (which requires §2.6) optional.

    Large parts of modern analysis deal mainly with the question of the interchange of two
limiting operations. When we have a chain of two limits, we cannot always just swap the
limits. For instance,

                             0 = lim lim   lim lim  = 1.
                                     +     + 

    When talking about sequences of functions, interchange of limits comes up quite often.
We look at several instances: continuity of the limit, the integral of the limit, the derivative
of the limit, and the convergence of power series.

6.2.1 Continuity of the limit

If  we  have     a  sequence  {   }       of   continuous   functions,   is    the  limit  continuous?   Suppose
                                            }
                                      =1
    is  the  (pointwise)  limit  of  {        =1  .  If  lim   =     ,   we    are  interested  in  the  following
                                          

interchange of limits, where the equality to prove is marked with a question mark. Equality

is not always true, in fact, the limits to the left of the question mark might not even exist.

                                                                    ?

             lim  () = lim lim () = lim lim () = lim () =  ().
                                                                                    

We   wish    to  find  conditions  on     the  sequence  {   }       so  that  the  equation  above  holds.  If  we

                                                                 =1
only require pointwise convergence, then the limit of a sequence of functions need not be

continuous, and the equation above need not hold.

Example 6.2.1: Define  : [0, 1]   as

                                          ()             1 -   if  < 1/,
                                                         0     if   1/.

See Figure 6.4.
    Each function  is continuous. Fix an   (0, 1]. If   1/, then   1/. Therefore for

  1/, we have () = 0, and so

                                                     lim () = 0.

                                                     

On the other hand, if  = 0, then

                                               lim (0) = lim 1 = 1.
                                                            

Thus the pointwise limit of  is the function  : [0, 1]   defined by

                                                () 1 if  = 0,
                                                          0 if  > 0.

The function  is not continuous at 0.

If we, however, require the convergence to be uniform, the limits can be interchanged.

Theorem   6.2.2.    Suppose       .  Let   { }          be  a  sequence  of  continuous   functions   :        

                                                  =1
converging uniformly to  :   . Then  is continuous.

Proof.  Let      be fixed.      Let  {   }       be  a  sequence  in     converging       to  .

                                             =1
Let       >  0  be  given.  As  { }        converges    uniformly     to     ,  we  find  a        such  that
                                                                                                 
                                       =1

                                           () -  () < /3

for all   . As  is continuous at , we find an    such that for all   ,

                                           () - () < /3.

Thus for all   ,

                 () -  () =  () - () + () - () + () -  ()
                                   () - () + () - () + () -  ()
                                 < /3 + /3 + /3 = .

Therefore,  () =1  converges to  (), and consequently  is continuous at . As  was
arbitrary,  is continuous everywhere.                                                                          

6.2.2 Integral of the limit

Again, if we simply require pointwise convergence, then the integral of a limit of a sequence
of functions need not be equal to the limit of the integrals.

    Each  is Riemann integrable (it is continuous on (0, 1] and bounded), and the
fundamental theorem of calculus says that

Let  us  compute  the     pointwise       limit  of   {  } .      Fix an       (0, 1].      For        1/, we have

  1/ and so () = 0. Hence,                                    =1

                                                 lim () = 0.

                                                 

We   also  have   (0)  =  0  for  all  .  So  the  pointwise      limit  of  { }        is  the  zero  function.  In

                                                                                    =1

     But if we require the convergence to be uniform, the limits can be interchanged.

     Weaker conditions are sufficient for this kind of theorem, but to prove such a generalization requires

more sophisticated machinery than we cover here: the Lebesgue integral. In particular, the theorem holds
with pointwise convergence as long as  is integrable and there is an  such that  [,]   for all .

Theorem    6.2.4.  Let  { }        be  a  sequence   of   Riemann  integrable  functions    :  [, ]      

                               =1
converging uniformly to  : [, ]  . Then  is Riemann integrable, and

                                                            

                                                 = lim .
                                                      

Proof. Let  > 0 be given. As  goes to  uniformly, we find an    such that for all
  , we have        () -  ()                                    [, ].
                                   <      2(-)  for  all              In  particular,  by  reverse  triangle

inequality,   ()   < +             ()       for all . Hence  is bounded, as  is bounded. Note

                       2(-)
that  is integrable and compute

                                                          

  - =                    () - () + ()  -                        () - () + ()

             =           () - ()  + ()  -                                  () - ()  - () 
                                                                                               

                                                

             =           () - ()  -                   () - () 

               2( - ) ( - ) +  2( - ) ( - ) = .

The first inequality is Proposition 5.2.5. The second inequality follows by Proposition 5.1.8
                                                           -
and the fact that for all          [, ], we have         2(-)  <   () -   ()   <           As       >  0 was

arbitrary,  is Riemann integrable.                                                2(-) .
                             
  Finally, we compute   . We apply Proposition 5.1.10 in the calculation. Again, for all
   (where  is the same as above),

                                                     

                                    -  =                     () - () 
                                          

                                                  2( - ) ( - ) = 2 < .

Therefore,     =1  converges to     . 

Example 6.2.5: Suppose we wish to compute

                                        1 lim  + sin(2) .
                                        0                 

It is impossible to compute the integrals for any particular  using calculus as sin(2) has
no closed-form antiderivative. However, we can compute the limit. We have shown before
238                                          CHAPTER 6. SEQUENCES OF FUNCTIONS

          +sin(  2 )

that  converges uniformly on [0, 1] to . By Theorem 6.2.4, the limit exists and

                        1 lim  + sin(2)  1  =   = 1/2.
                        0                  
                                                      0

Example 6.2.6: If convergence is only pointwise, the limit need not even be Riemann
integrable. On [0, 1] define

                       ()         1 if  = / in lowest terms and   ,
                                  0 otherwise.

Each function  differs from the zero function at finitely many points; there are only
finitely many fractions in [0, 1] with denominator less than or equal to . So  is integrable
     1      1
and 0  = 0 0 = 0. It is an easy exercise to show that { }=1 converges pointwise to the

Dirichlet function

                                       () 1 if   ,
                                                 0 otherwise,

which is not Riemann integrable.

Example 6.2.7: In fact, if the convergence is only pointwise, the limit of bounded functions
is not even necessarily bounded. Define  : [0, 1]   by

                                      ()     0 if  < 1/,
                                             1/ else.

For every  we get that ()   for all   [0, 1] so the functions are bounded. However,
{   }
            converges  pointwise  to  the  unbounded  function
        =1

                                       () 0 if  = 0,
                                                 1/ else.

6.2.3 Derivative of the limit

While uniform convergence is enough to swap limits with integrals, it is not, however,
enough to swap limits with derivatives, unless you also have uniform convergence of the
derivatives themselves.

Example 6.2.8: Let ()      sin(  )
                                   . Then  converges uniformly to 0. See Figure 6.6. The
derivative of the limit is 0. But () = cos(), which does not converge even pointwise,
for example () = (-1). Moreover, (0) = 1 for all , which does converge, but not to 0.

Hence,          =1  converges    pointwise  to   a  function  that  is                                   0.  We  compute

                                           () = 2 2 -2 .
                                                     (1 +  )

For every , lim () = 0, so the derivatives converge pointwise to 0, but the reader
can check that the convergence is not uniform on any interval containing 0. The limit of 
is not differentiable at 0--it is not even continuous at 0. See Figure 6.7.

    See the exercises for more examples. Using the fundamental theorem of calculus, we
find an answer for continuously differentiable functions. The following theorem is true
even if we do not assume continuity of the derivatives, but the proof is more difficult.

Theorem 6.2.10. Let  be a bounded interval and let  :    be continuously differentiable

functions.  Suppose           =1  converges    uniformly      to  :            ,      and       suppose

a convergent sequence for some   .               Then              converges          uniformly      to  a   continuously
differentiable function  :   , and   = .                       =1
240                                                         CHAPTER 6. SEQUENCES OF FUNCTIONS

Proof. Define  ()        lim           ( ).    As         are  continuous    and  hence     Riemann        integrable,

                                                    
then via the fundamental theorem of calculus, we find that for   ,

                                                             
                                           () = () + .

                                                                        

As  {      }   converges  uniformly        on   ,  it  converges  uniformly       on   [,   ]  (or  [,     ]  if    <  ).
           =1
Thus, the limit as    on the right-hand side exists. Define  at the remaining points

(where   ) by this limit:

                                                                                

                           () lim () + lim                            =   () +         .
                                                                                    

The function  is continuous, being the uniform limit of continuous functions. Hence  is
differentiable and  () = () for all    by the second form of the fundamental theorem.

    It remains to prove uniform convergence. Suppose  has a lower bound  and upper

bound . Let  > 0 be given. Take  such that for all   , we have  () - () < /2
       () - ()                                
and                <  2(-)       for  all       .  Then

                                                                                        

                    () - () =  () +                             - () +                 

                                                                                     

                                             () - () +                   -          
                                                                   
                                                                         () - () 
                                           =  () - () +           

                                           < 2 +  2( - ) ( - ) = . 

    The proof goes through without boundedness of , except for the uniform convergence
of  to  . As an example suppose  =  and let () /. Then () = 1/, which
                                                {   }
converges     uniformly  to  0.  However,                   converges    to  0  only  pointwise.

6.2.4 Convergence of power series

In §2.6 we saw that a power series converges absolutely inside its radius of convergence, so
it converges pointwise. Let us show that it (and all its derivatives) also converges uniformly.
This fact allows us to swap several types of limits. Not only is the limit continuous, we can
integrate and even differentiate convergent power series term by term.

Proposition 6.2.11. Let               (    -  )    be  a  convergent  power  series   with  a  radius  of  convergence
                             =0
, where 0 <   . Then the series converges uniformly in [ - ,  + ] whenever 0 <  < .

    In particular, the series converges (pointwise) to a continuous function on ( - ,  + ) if

 < , or on  if  = .
6.2. INTERCHANGE OF LIMITS                                                                             241

Proof. Let  ( - ,  + ) if  < , or let   if  = . Take 0 <  < . The series
                                                                                        
converges absolutely for every   , in particular if  =  + . So               =0  ||         converges.

Given  > 0, find  such that for all   ,

                                        

                                            ||  < .

                                     =+1

For all   [ - ,  + ] and all  > ,

                                          
    ( - ) - ( - )
                                  = ( - )

=0      =0                           =+1

                                            || | - |                             

                                                                   ||                   ||  < .

                                     =+1                      =+1               =+1

The partial sums are therefore uniformly Cauchy on [ - ,  + ] and hence converge

uniformly on that set.

Moreover, the partial sums are polynomials, which are continuous, and so their uniform

limit on [ - ,  + ] is a continuous function. As  <  was arbitrary, the limit function is

continuous on all of .                                                                                    

    As we said, we will show that power series can be differentiated and integrated term
by term. The differentiated or integrated series is again a power series, and we will show
it has the same radius of convergence. Therefore, any power series defines an infinitely
differentiable function.

    We first prove that we can antidifferentiate, as integration only needs uniform limits.

Corollary 6.2.12. Let       (  -  )  be  a  convergent  power  series  with  a  radius  of  convergence
                        =0
0 <   . Let  ( - ,  + ) if  <  or   if  = . Let  :    be the limit. Then

                                   = -1 ( - ) ,
                                 =1 

where the radius of convergence of this series is at least .

Proof. Take 0 <  < . The partial sums           (  -    )     converge  uniformly  on       [  -  ,    +  ].
                                            =0
For every fixed   [ - ,  + ], the convergence is also uniform on [, ] (or [, ] if  < ).

Hence,

 = lim ( - )  = lim ( - )         +1  = lim -1 ( - ) . 
   =0                                  =0                                =1

Corollary 6.2.13. Let      (        -  )  be  a  convergent  power  series  with  a  radius  of  convergence
                       =0
0 <   . Let  ( - ,  + ) if  <  or   if  = . Let  :    be the limit. Then

 is a differentiable function, and

                                                 

                                    () = ( + 1)+1( - ) ,

                                                =0

where the radius of convergence of this series is .

Proof. Take 0 <  < . The series converges uniformly on [ - ,  + ], but we need uniform
convergence of the derivative. Let

                                        lim sup ||1/ .

                                                  

As the series is convergent  < , and the radius of convergence is 1/ (or  if  = 0).
    Let  > 0 be given. In Example 2.2.14, we saw lim 1/ = 1. Hence there exists an

 such that for all   , we have 1/ < 1 + . So

      = lim sup ||1/  lim sup ||1/  (1 + ) lim sup ||1/ = (1 + ).
                                                                   

As  was arbitrary, lim sup ||1/ = . Therefore,                              (        -  )    has  radius   of
                                                                      =1                
convergence . By dividing by ( - ), we find                  =0( + 1)+1( - ) has radius of

convergence  as well.                                             ),

Consequently, the partial sums            =0(     +  1)+1(     -        which     are   derivatives    of  the
                          ),
partial sums    +1  (  -         converge  uniformly    on   [  -  ,    +   ].  Furthermore,      the  series
                =0
clearly converges at  = . We may thus apply Theorem 6.2.10, and we are done as  < 

was arbitrary.                                                                                             

Example 6.2.14: We could have used this result to define the exponential function. That is,

the power series                            () 
                                                   =0 !

has radius of convergence  = . Furthermore,  (0) = 1, and by differentiating term by
term, we find that  () =  ().

Example 6.2.15: The series                        

                                                     

                                                 =1

converges to  (1-)2 on (-1, 1).                                             
                                                   1                        =1      -1
Proof: On (-1, 1),                 converges  to        The  derivative                 then      converges

uniformly to a function  such that  is not differentiable. Hint: There are many possibilities, simplest is

perhaps  to  combine     ||  and   2      +  1,  another  is  to  consider      2 + (1/)2. Show that these functions are

                                  2          2

differentiable, converge uniformly, and then show that the limit is not differentiable.

Exercise 6.2.4: Show lim -2  = 0. Feel free to use calculus facts about the exponential.

                                      1

Exercise 6.2.5: Find an example of a sequence of continuous functions on (0, 1) that converges pointwise to a
continuous function on (0, 1), but the convergence is not uniform.

    Note: In the previous exercise, (0, 1) was picked for simplicity. For a more challenging exercise,
replace (0, 1) with [0, 1].

Exercise 6.2.6:  True/False; prove or find a counterexample to the following statement:                If  {    }     is  a  sequence

                                                                                                                  =1
of everywhere discontinuous functions on [0, 1] that converge uniformly to a function  , then  is everywhere

discontinuous.

Exercise 6.2.7: For a continuously differentiable function  : [, ]  , define

                                                  1            [,] +   [,] .

Suppose  {   }       is  a  sequence  of  continuously  differentiable  functions  such     that  for  every    >  0,  there  exists

                 =1
an  such that for all ,   , we have

                                                         -  1 < .

Show  that   { }         converges  uniformly    to  some  continuously     differentiable  function       :  [, ]        .

                    =1

Suppose  : [0, 1]   is Riemann integrable. For the following two exercises define the number

                                                              1

It is true that  is integrable whenever  is, see Exercise 5.2.15. The number is called the 1-norm
and defines another very common type of convergence called the 1-convergence. It is, however, a

bit more subtle.

Exercise 6.2.8:      Suppose  {   }          is a sequence of Riemann integrable functions on [0, 1] that converges

uniformly to 0. Show that             =1

Exercise 6.2.17 (Challenging): The Dirichlet function  : [0, 1]  , that is the function such that

6.3 Picard's theorem

Note: 1-2 lectures (can be safely skipped)

    A first semester course in analysis should have a pièce de résistance caliber theorem. We
pick a theorem whose proof combines everything we have learned. It is more sophisticated
than the fundamental theorem of calculus, the first highlight theorem of this course.
The theorem we are talking about is Picard's theorem on existence and uniqueness of
a solution to an ordinary differential equation. Both the statement and the proof are
beautiful examples of what one can do with the material we mastered so far. It is also a
good example of how analysis is applied, as differential equations are indispensable in
science of every stripe.

6.3.1 First order ordinary differential equation

Modern science is described in the language of differential equations. That is, equations
involving not only the unknown, but also its derivatives. The simplest nontrivial form of a
differential equation is the so-called first order ordinary differential equation

                                                    = (, ).

Generally, we also specify an initial condition (0) = 0. The solution of the equation is a
function () such that (0) = 0 and () =  , () . See Figure 6.8 for a graphical
representation as a so-called slope field.

                      ( 0, 0)

  Figure 6.8: A slope field giving the slope (, ) at each point, in this case (, ) = (1 - ). A
  solution is drawn going through the point (0, 0) = (1, 0.3), notice how it follows the slopes.

    When  involves only the  variable, the solution is given by the fundamental theorem of
calculus. On the other hand, when  depends on both  and , we need far more firepower.
It is not always true that a solution exists, and if it does, that it is the unique solution.
Picard's theorem gives us certain sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness.

     Named for the French mathematician Charles Émile Picard (1856-1941).

6.3.2 The theorem

We need a definition of continuity in two variables. A point in the plane 2 =  × 
is denoted by an ordered pair (, ). For simplicity, we give the following sequential
definition of continuity.

Definition 6.3.1. Let   2 be a set,  :    a function, and (, )   a point. The

                                                                                                                 

function  is continuous at (, ) if for every sequence ( , ) =1 of points in  such that
lim  =  and lim  = , we have

                                            lim ( , ) = (, ).

                                                           

We say  is continuous if it is continuous at all points in .

Theorem 6.3.2 (Picard's theorem on existence and uniqueness). Let ,    be closed bounded
intervals, let  and  be their interiors, and let (0, 0)   × . Suppose  :  ×    is
continuous and Lipschitz in the second variable, that is, there exists an    such that

(, ) - (, )    -  for all ,   ,   .

Then there exists an  > 0 such that [0 - , 0 + ]   and a unique differentiable function
 : [0 - , 0 + ]     such that

 () =  ,  () and  (0) = 0.                                     (6.1)

Proof. Suppose we could find a solution  . Using the fundamental theorem of calculus
we integrate the equation  () =  ,  () ,  (0) = 0, and write (6.1) as the integral

equation  

                        () = 0 +  ,  () .                      (6.2)
                                    0

The idea of our proof is that we try to plug in approximations to a solution to the right-hand

side of (6.2) to get better approximations on the left-hand side of (6.2). We hope that in the

end the sequence converges and solves (6.2) and hence (6.1). The technique below is called
Picard iteration, and the individual functions  are called the Picard iterates.

    Without loss of generality, suppose 0 = 0 (exercise below). Another exercise tells us
that  is bounded as it is continuous. Therefore pick some  > 0 so that (, )   for
all (, )   × . Pick  > 0 such that [-, ]   and [0 - , 0 + ]  . Define

                        min ,   +  .

Observe [-, ]  .
    Set 0() 0. We define  inductively. Assuming -1([-, ])  [0 - , 0 + ], we

see  , -1() is a well-defined function of  for   [-, ]. Further if -1 is continuous

By interior of [, ], we mean (, ).
248                                                       CHAPTER 6. SEQUENCES OF FUNCTIONS

on [-, ], then  , -1() is continuous as a function of  on [-, ] (left as an exercise).

Define                                                 

                                        ()        0 +  , -1() ,

                                                            0

and  is continuous on [-, ] by the fundamental theorem of calculus. To see that 
maps [-, ] to [0 - , 0 + ], we compute for   [-, ]

                   () - 0 =  , -1()    ||        .
                                                                                 + 
                                     0

We next define +1 using  and so on. Thus we have inductively defined a sequence
{ }
           of functions.       We need to show that it converges to a function               that solves the
       =1
equation (6.2) and therefore (6.1).
                                                        }
    We     wish  to  show      that  the  sequence  {           converges  uniformly  to   some  function  on
                                                            =1
[-, ]. First, for   [-, ], we have the following useful bound

                      , () -  , ()   () - ()    -  [-,] ,

where  -  [-,] is the uniform norm, that is the supremum of () - () for
     [-  ,  ].                       ||              
                Now  note      that                       Therefore
                                                  + .

                                                                     

                     () - () =                     , -1()  -  , -1() 

                                               0                     0

                                          =        , -1() -  , -1() 

                                               0

                                            -1 - -1 [-,] ||

                                             +  -1 - -1 [-,] .

Let                  and   note  that     <  1.   Taking  supremum   on    the  left-hand  side  we  get
            +

                                      -  [-,]   -1 - -1 [-,] .

Without loss of generality, suppose   . Then by induction we can show

                                         -  [-,]    - - 0 [-,] .

For   [-, ], we have

                                     -() - 0() = -() - 0  .

Therefore,                        -  [-,]    - - 0 [-,]    .

As    <     1,  { }        is  uniformly  Cauchy    and   by    Proposition  6.1.13  we  obtain  that  { }

                       =1                                                                                     =1
converges uniformly on [-, ] to some function  : [-, ]  . The function  is the
6.3. PICARD'S THEOREM                                                                            249

uniform limit of continuous functions and therefore continuous. Furthermore, since

 [-, ]  [0 - , 0 + ] for all , then  [-, ]  [0 - , 0 + ] (why?).
    We now need to show that  solves (6.2). First, as before we notice

                   , () -  ,  ()   () -  ()    -  [-,] .

As  -  [-,] converges to 0, then  , () converges uniformly to  ,  () for
  [-, ]. Hence, for   [-, ] the convergence is uniform for   [0, ] (or [, 0] if

 < 0). Therefore,

                                 
    0 + (,  ()
                       = 0 +  , lim () 
              0                             
                                 0

                         = 0 + lim  , ()                     (by continuity of )
                                                             (by uniform convergence)
                                       0 

                                         

                         = lim 0 +  , () 
                             
                                         0

                         = lim +1() =  ().

                            

We apply the fundamental theorem of calculus (Theorem 5.3.3) to show that  is differen-
tiable and its derivative is  ,  () . It is obvious that  (0) = 0.

    Finally, what is left to do is to show uniqueness. Suppose  : [-, ]     is another
solution. As before we use the fact that  ,  () -  , ()    -  [-,]. Then

                                                   

         () - ()   = 0 +  ,  ()  - 0 +  , () 

                       0 0

                   =          ,  () -  , () 

                          0                    -  [-,]   +                  -  [-,] .

                      -  [-,] ||  

As  before,    =      <  1.  By  taking  supremum  over      [-  ,  ]  on  the  left-hand  side  we
                  +
obtain

                                  -  [-,]    -  [-,] .

This is only possible if  -  [-,] = 0. Therefore,  = , and the solution is unique. 

6.3.3 Examples

Let us look at some examples. The proof of the theorem gives us an explicit way to find an
 that works. It does not, however, give us the best . It is often possible to find a much
larger  for which the conclusion of the theorem holds.

    The proof also gives us the Picard iterates as approximations to the solution. So the
proof actually tells us how to obtain the solution, not just that the solution exists.
250                                      CHAPTER 6. SEQUENCES OF FUNCTIONS

Example 6.3.3: Consider   () =  (),  (0) = 1.

That is, we suppose (, ) = , and we are looking for a function  such that  () =  ().

Let us forget for the moment that we solved this equation in §5.4. See also Figure 5.7 for a
plot of both the equation, showing the slope (, ) =  at each point, and the solution, the
exponential, that satisfies  (0) = 1.

    We pick any  that contains 0 in the interior. We pick an arbitrary  that contains 1 in
its interior. We can use  = 1. The theorem guarantees an  > 0 such that there exists a
unique solution  : [-, ]  . This solution is usually denoted by

                                        ().

We leave it to the reader to verify that by picking  and  large enough the proof of the
theorem guarantees that we are able to pick  such that we get any  we want as long as
 < 1/2. We omit the calculation. Of course, we know this function exists as a function for
all , so an arbitrary  ought to work, but the theorem only provides  < 1/2.

    By same reasoning as above, no matter what 0 and 0 are, the proof guarantees
an arbitrary  as long as  < 1/2. Fix such an . We get a unique function defined on
[0 - , 0 + ]. After defining the function on [-, ] we find a solution on the interval
[0, 2] and notice that the two functions must coincide on [0, ] by uniqueness. We thus
iteratively construct the exponential for all   . Therefore, Picard's theorem could be

used to prove the existence and uniqueness of the exponential.                   1. Then
    Let us compute the Picard iterates. We start with the constant function 0()

     

     1() = 1 + 0()  = 1 + ,

     2() = 1 + 1()  = 1 + (1 + )  = 1 +  + ,

     0                                0

     3() = 1 + 2()  = 1 +                1 +  +   = 1 +  +  +  .223

We recognize the beginning of the Taylor series for the exponential. See Figure 6.9.

derivative of the solution grows as 2, and so the  required has to be larger and larger as

0  grows.  If  we  apply  the  theorem  with  0  close  to  1  and  0  =    1  we  find  that  the    that
                                                                          1-0
the proof guarantees is smaller and smaller as 0 approaches 1.

    The  from the proof is not the best . By picking  correctly, the proof of the theorem
guarantees  = 1 - 3/2  0.134 (we omit the calculation) for 0 = 0 and 0 = 1, even though

we saw above that any  < 1 should work.

Example 6.3.5: Consider the equation

                                () = 2  () ,  (0) = 0.

The function (, ) = 2  is continuous, but not Lipschitz in  (why?). The equation
does not satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem. The function

                                             () = -2 2 if   0, if  < 0,

is a solution, but  () = 0 is also a solution. A solution exists, but is not unique.

Example 6.3.6: Consider  = () where () 0 if    and () 1 if   . In
other words, the (, ) = () is discontinuous. The equation has no solution regardless
of the initial conditions. A solution would have derivative , but  does not have the
intermediate value property at any point (why?). No solution exists by Darboux's theorem.

    The examples show that without the Lipschitz condition, a solution might exist but not
be unique, and without continuity of , we may not have a solution at all. It is in fact a
theorem, the Peano existence theorem, that if  is continuous a solution exists (but may not
be unique).

Remark 6.3.7. It is possible to weaken what we mean by "solution to  = (, )" by

                                                                                        
focusing on the integral equation  () = 0 + 0  ,  () . For example, let  be the
Heaviside function , that is () 0 for  < 0 and () 1 for   0. Then  = (),                                   

(0) = 0, is a common equation. The "solution" is the ramp function  ()                                     0 if  < 0

                                                                                                         
and  ()  if   0, since this function satisfies  () = 0 () . Notice, however, that
 (0) does not exist, so  is only a so-called weak solution to the differential equation.

Metric Spaces

7.1 Metric spaces

Note: 1.5 lectures

    As mentioned in the introduction, the main idea in analysis is to take limits. In chapter 2
we learned to take limits of sequences of real numbers. And in chapter 3 we learned to
take limits of functions as a real number approached some other real number.

    We want to take limits in more complicated contexts. For example, we want to have
sequences of points in 3-dimensional space. We wish to define continuous functions of
several variables. We even want to define functions on spaces that are a little harder to
describe, such as the surface of the earth. We still want to talk about limits there.

    Finally, we have seen the limit of a sequence of functions in chapter 6. We wish to unify
all these notions so that we do not have to reprove theorems over and over again in each
context. The concept of a metric space is an elementary yet powerful tool in analysis. And
while it is not sufficient to describe every type of limit we find in modern analysis, it gets
us very far indeed.

Definition 7.1.1. Let  be a set, and let  :  ×    be a function such that for all
, ,   

(i) (, )  0.                       (nonnegativity)

(ii) (, ) = 0 if and only if  = .  (identity of indiscernibles)

(iii) (, ) = (, ).                 (symmetry)

(iv) (, )  (, ) + (, ).            (triangle inequality)

The pair ( , ) is called a metric space. The function  is called the metric or the distance
function. Sometimes we write just  as the metric space instead of ( , ) if the metric is

clear from context.

    The geometric idea is that  is the distance between two points. Items (i)-(iii) have
obvious geometric interpretation: Distance is always nonnegative, the only point that is
256                                                             CHAPTER 7. METRIC SPACES

distance 0 away from  is  itself, and finally that the distance from  to  is the same as the
distance from  to . The triangle inequality (iv) has the interpretation given in Figure 7.1.

                                      (, ) 

Figure 7.1: Diagram of the triangle inequality in metric spaces.

    For the purposes of drawing, it is convenient to draw figures and diagrams in the plane
with the metric being the euclidean distance. However, that is only one particular metric
space. Just because a certain fact seems to be clear from drawing a picture does not mean it
is true in every metric space. You might be getting sidetracked by intuition from euclidean
geometry, whereas the concept of a metric space is a lot more general.

    Let us give some examples of metric spaces.

Example 7.1.2: The set of real numbers  is a metric space with the metric

                                   (, )  -  .

Items (i)-(iii) of the definition are easy to verify. The triangle inequality (iv) follows
immediately from the standard triangle inequality for real numbers:

            (, ) = | - | =  -  +  -    -  +  -  = (, ) + (, ).

This metric is the standard metric on . If we talk about  as a metric space without
mentioning a specific metric, we mean this particular metric.

Example 7.1.3: We can also put a different metric on the set of real numbers. For example,
take the set of real numbers  together with the metric

                                   (, )            - .
                                                 - +1

Items (i)-(iii) are again easy to verify. The triangle inequality (iv) is a little bit more difficult.
                                                  
Note  that  (,  )  =  (    -    )  where  ()  =  +1  and    is  an  increasing  function  (positive

derivative, see Figure 7.2). Hence

                (, ) = (| - |) = (  -  +  -  )
                                           (  -  +  -  )
                                          = - + -
                                              - + - +1
                                          = - + -
                                              - + - +1 - + - +1
                                            -  +  -  = (, ) + (, ).
                                              - +1 - +1

The function  is thus a metric, and gives an example of a nonstandard metric on . With
this metric, (, ) < 1 for all ,   . That is, every two points are less than 1 unit apart.

    An important metric space is the -dimensional euclidean space  =  ×  × · · · × .
We use the following notation for points:  = (1, 2, . . . , )  . We will not write ì
nor x for a point in  as is common in multivariable calculus, we simply give it a name
such as  and we will remember that  is an element of . We also write simply 0  
to mean the point (0, 0, . . . , 0). Before making  a metric space, we prove an important
inequality, the so-called Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

Lemma 7.1.4 (Cauchy-Schwarz inequality). Suppose  = (1, 2, . . . , )  ,  =
(1, 2, . . . , )  . Then

                                              2                     

                                                                2      2 .

                                  =1                                       
                                                                   =1
                                                        =1

     Sometimes it is called the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality. Karl Hermann Amandus Schwarz
(1843-1921) was a German mathematician and Viktor Yakovlevich Bunyakovsky (1804-1889) was a Ukrainian
mathematician. What we stated should really be called the Cauchy inequality, as Bunyakovsky and Schwarz
provided proofs for infinite-dimensional versions.

Proof. A square of a real number is nonnegative. Hence a sum of squares is nonnegative:

           =1  =1

                                                                    

     =         2             2 +          2          2  -2               .

                                                                    =1

           =1       =1                =1       =1           =1

We relabel and divide by 2 to obtain precisely what we wanted,

                                                                2

                                =1        =1            =1

Example 7.1.5: Let us construct the standard metric for . Define

     (, )      (1 - 1)2 + (2 - 2)2 + · · · + ( - )2 =               

                                                                       ( - )2.

                                                                   =1

For  = 1, the real line, this metric agrees with what we defined above. For  > 1, the
only tricky part of the definition to check, as before, is the triangle inequality. It is less
messy to work with the square of the metric. In the following estimate, note the use of the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

                          

     (, ) 2 = ( - )2

             =1

             =1

                                                          

           = ( - )2 + ( - )2 + 2 ( - )( - )

             =1                     =1                  =1

                                                                   

            ( - )2 + ( - )2 + 2                                 ( - )2 ( - )2

             =1                     =1                      =1     =1

                       2

                   =1                     =1

Because the square root is an increasing function, the inequality is preserved when we take
the square root of both sides, and we obtain the triangle inequality.

Example 7.1.6: The set of complex numbers  is the set of numbers  =  + , where 
and  are in . By imposing 2 = -1, we make  into a field. For the purposes of taking
limits, the set  is regarded as the metric space 2, where  =  +     corresponds to

(, )  2. For  =  +   define the complex modulus by || 2 + 2. Then for two
complex numbers 1 = 1 +  1 and 2 = 2 +  2, the distance is

        (1, 2) = (1 - 2)2 + (1 - 2)2 = |1 - 2|.

Furthermore, when working with complex numbers it is often convenient to write the
metric in terms of the so-called complex conjugate: The conjugate of  =  +  is ¯  - .

Then ||2 = 2 + 2 = ¯, and so |1 - 2|2 = (1 - 2)(1 - 2).

Example 7.1.7: An example to keep in mind is the so-called discrete metric. For any set ,

define

                    (, )      1 if   ,
                              0 if  = .

That is, all points are equally distant from each other. When  is a finite set, we can draw a

diagram, see for example Figure 7.3. Of course, in the diagram the distances are not the
normal euclidean distances in the plane. Things become subtle when  is an infinite set

such as the real numbers.

                            1

Figure 7.3: Sample discrete metric space {, , , , }, the distance between any two points is 1.

    While this particular example may seldom come up in practice, it gives a useful "smell
test." If you make a statement about metric spaces, try it with the discrete metric. To show
that ( , ) is indeed a metric space is left as an exercise.

Example 7.1.8: Let  [, ],  be the set of continuous real-valued functions on the
interval [, ]. Define the metric on  [, ],  as

                    (  , )   sup  () - () .

                            [,]

Let us check the properties. First, (  , ) is finite as  () - () is a continuous function
on a closed bounded interval [, ], and so is bounded. It is clear that (  , )  0, it is the
260                                                   CHAPTER 7. METRIC SPACES

supremum of nonnegative numbers. If  = , then  () - () = 0 for all , and hence
(  , ) = 0. Conversely, if (  , ) = 0, then for every , we have  () - ()  (  , ) = 0,
and hence  () = () for all , and so  = . That (  , ) = (,  ) is equally trivial. To

show the triangle inequality we use the standard triangle inequality;

        (  , ) = sup           () - () = sup  () - () + () - ()

                         [,]                           [,]

                  sup          () - () + () - ()

                         [,]   () - () + sup () - () = (  , ) + (, ).

                  sup                                  [,]

                         [,]

When treating  [, ],  as a metric space without mentioning a metric, we mean this
particular metric. Notice that (  , ) =  -  [,], the uniform norm of Definition 6.1.9.

    This example may seem esoteric at first, but it turns out that working with spaces
such as  [, ],  is really the meat of a large part of modern analysis. Treating sets of

functions as metric spaces allows us to abstract away a lot of the grubby detail and prove

powerful results such as Picard's theorem with less work.

Example 7.1.9: Another useful example of a metric space is the sphere with a metric

usually called the great circle distance. Let 2 be the unit sphere in 3, that is 2 { 

3    :  2 + 2 + 2  = 1}.  Take  and  in 2, draw a line through the origin and , and

          123
another line through the origin and , and let  be the angle that the two lines make.

Then define (, ) . See Figure 7.4. The law of cosines from vector calculus says

(, ) = arccos(11 + 22 + 33). It is relatively easy to see that this function satisfies

the first three properties of a metric. Triangle inequality is harder to prove, and requires a

bit more trigonometry and linear algebra than we wish to indulge in right now, so let us

leave it without proof.

                              2

  Figure 7.4: The great circle distance on the unit sphere.

    This distance is the shortest distance between points on a sphere if we are allowed
to travel on the sphere only. It is easy to generalize to arbitrary diameters. If we take a
sphere of radius , we let the distance be (, ) . As an example, this is the standard
distance you would use if you compute a distance on the surface of the earth, such as
computing the distance a plane travels from London to Los Angeles.

    Oftentimes it is useful to consider a subset of a larger metric space as a metric space
itself. We obtain the following proposition, which has a trivial proof.

Proposition 7.1.10. Let ( , ) be a metric space and   . Then the restriction |× is a
metric on .

Definition 7.1.11. If ( , ) is a metric space,   , and   |×, then (, ) is said to
be a subspace of ( , ).

    It is common to simply write  for the metric on , as it is the restriction of the metric
on . Sometimes we say  is the subspace metric and  has the subspace topology.

    A subset of the real numbers is bounded whenever all its elements are at most some
fixed distance from 0. When dealing with an arbitrary metric space there may not be some
natural fixed point 0, but for the purposes of boundedness it does not matter.

Definition 7.1.12. Let ( , ) be a metric space. A subset    is said to be bounded if there
exists a    and a    such that

                         (, )   for all   .

We say ( , ) is bounded if  itself is a bounded subset.

    For example, the set of real numbers with the standard metric is not a bounded metric
space. It is not hard to see that a subset of the real numbers is bounded in the sense of
chapter 1 if and only if it is bounded as a subset of the metric space of real numbers with
the standard metric.

    On the other hand, if we take the real numbers with the discrete metric, then we obtain
a bounded metric space. In fact, any set with the discrete metric is bounded.

    There are other equivalent ways we could generalize boundedness, and are left as
exercises. Suppose  is nonempty to avoid a technicality. Then    being bounded is
equivalent to either

   (i) For every   , there exists a  > 0 such that (, )   for all   .

  (ii) diam() sup (, ) : ,    < .

The quantity diam() is called the diameter of a set and is usually only defined for a
nonempty set.

7.2 Open and closed sets

Note: 2 lectures

7.2.1 Topology

Before we get to convergence, we define the so-called topology. That is, we define open and
closed sets in a metric space. And before that, we define two special open and closed sets.

Definition 7.2.1. Let ( , ) be a metric space,   , and  > 0. Define the open ball, or
simply ball, of radius  around  as

                           (, )    : (, ) <  .

Define the closed ball as

                           (, )    : (, )   .

    When dealing with different metric spaces, it is sometimes vital to emphasize which
metric space the ball is in. We do this by writing (, ) (, ) or (, ) (, ).

Example 7.2.2: Take the metric space  with the standard metric. For    and  > 0,

(, ) = ( - ,  + ) and (, ) = [ - ,  + ].

Example 7.2.3: Be careful when working on a subspace. Consider the metric space [0, 1] as
a subspace of . Then in [0, 1],

                    (0, 1/2) = [0,1](0, 1/2) =   [0, 1] : 0 -  < 1/2 = [0, 1/2).

This is different from (0, 1/2) = (-1/2, 1/2). The important thing to keep in mind is which
metric space we are working in.

Definition 7.2.4. Let ( , ) be a metric space. A subset    is open if for every   ,
there exists a  > 0 such that (, )  . See Figure 7.5. A subset    is closed if the
complement  =  \  is open. When the ambient space  is not clear from context, we
say  is open in  and  is closed in .

    If    and  is open, then we say  is an open neighborhood of  (or sometimes just
neighborhood).

    Intuitively, an open set  is a set that does not include its "boundary." Wherever we
are in , we are allowed to "wiggle" a little bit and stay in . Similarly, a set  is closed if
everything not in  is some distance away from . The open and closed balls are examples
of open and closed sets (this must still be proved). But not every set is either open or closed.
Generally, most subsets are neither.
7.2. OPEN AND CLOSED SETS                                                  265

                                                     

                                                         
                                                     (, )

Figure 7.5: Open set in a metric space. Note that  depends on .

Example 7.2.5: The set (0, )   is open: Given any   (0, ), let  . Then

(, ) = (0, 2)  (0, ).                                                     -. Then (, ) =
    The set [0, )   is closed: Given   (-, 0) = [0, ), let 

(-2, 0)  (-, 0) = [0, ).

The set [0, 1)   is neither open nor closed. First, every ball in  around 0, (0, ) =

(-, ), contains negative numbers and hence is not contained in [0, 1). So [0, 1) is not open.

Second, every ball in  around 1, (1, ) = (1 - , 1 + ), contains numbers strictly less
than 1 and greater than 0 (e.g. 1 - /2 as long as  < 2). Thus [0, 1) =  \ [0, 1) is not open,

and [0, 1) is not closed.

If ( , ) is any metric space, and    is a point, then {} is closed (exercise). On the

other hand, {} may or may not be open depending on . The set {0}   is not open as

(0, ) contains nonzero numbers for every  > 0. If  = {}, then {} is open.

Proposition 7.2.6. Let ( , ) be a metric space.
   (i)  and  are open.
  (ii) If 1, 2, . . . ,  are open subsets of , then

                                           

                                              

                                          =1

      is also open. That is, a finite intersection of open sets is open.
(iii) If {} is an arbitrary collection of open subsets of , then

                                              

                                          

       is also open. That is, a union of open sets is open.    , we simply mean the set of

    The index set  in (iii) can be arbitrarily large. By
all  such that    for at least one   .

Proof. The sets  and  are obviously open in .
                             
Let us prove (ii). If                                for all  .  As       are all open, for every  
                             =1 , then
there exists a  > 0 such that (, )  . Take  min{1, 2, . . . , } and notice  > 0.

We have (, )  (, )   for every  and so (, )                                                 Consequently the

                                                                                   =1 .

intersection is open.

    Let us prove (iii). If    , then    for some   . As  is open, there exists
a  > 0 such that (, )  . But then (, )   , and so the union is open. 

Example 7.2.7: Notice the difference between items (ii) and (iii). Item (ii) is not true for an
                                        (-1/,
arbitrary intersection. For instance,          1/)  =  {0},  which                 is  not  open.
                                       =1

    The proof of the following analogous proposition for closed sets is left as an exercise.
Proposition 7.2.8. Let ( , ) be a metric space.

   (i)  and  are closed.
  (ii) If {} is an arbitrary collection of closed subsets of , then

                                           

                                       

      is also closed. That is, an intersection of closed sets is closed.
(iii) If 1, 2, . . . ,  are closed subsets of , then

                                                                                 

                                                              

                                                                               =1

       is also closed. That is, a finite union of closed sets is closed.

    Despite the naming, we have not yet shown that the open ball is open and the closed
ball is closed. Let us show these facts now to justify the terminology.

Proposition 7.2.9. Let ( , ) be a metric space,   , and  > 0. Then (, ) is open and
(, ) is closed.

Proof. Let   (, ). Let   - (, ). As  > 0, consider   (, ). Then

     (, )  (, ) + (, ) < (, ) +  = (, ) +  - (, ) = .

Therefore,   (, ) for every   (, ). So (, )  (, ), and so (, ) is open.

See Figure 7.6.

The proof that (, ) is closed is left as an exercise.                                              

    Again, be careful about which metric space we are in. The set [0, 1/2) is an open ball in
[0, 1], and so [0, 1/2) is an open set in [0, 1]. On the other hand, [0, 1/2) is neither open nor
closed in .

Proposition 7.2.10. Let ,  be two real numbers,  < . Then (, ), (, ), and (-, ) are
open in . Also [, ], [, ), and (-, ] are closed in .

    The proof is left as an exercise. Keep in mind that there are many other open and closed
sets in the set of real numbers.

Proposition 7.2.11. Suppose ( , ) is a metric space, and   . Then    is open in 
(in the subspace topology) if and only if there exists an open set    (so open in ) such that
   = .

    For example, let  ,    [0, 1],   [0, 1/2). We saw that  is an open set in . We
may take  (-1/2, 1/2).

Proof. Suppose    is open and    = . Let   . As  is open and   , there
exists a  > 0 such that (, )  . Then

                     (, ) = (, )       = .

So  is open in .

The proof of the opposite direction, that is, that if    is open in the subspace

topology there exists a  is left as Exercise 7.2.12.                                       

    A hint for finishing the proof (the exercise) is that a useful way to think about an open
set is as a union of open balls. If  is open, then for each   , there is a  > 0 (depending
on ) such that (, )  . Then  =  (, ).

    In the case of an open subset of an open set or a closed subset of a closed set, matters
are simpler.

Proposition 7.2.12. Suppose ( , ) is a metric space,    is open, and    is closed.

   (i)    is open in the subspace topology if and only if  is open in .
  (ii)    is closed in the subspace topology if and only if  is closed in .

Proof. We prove (i) and leave (ii) as an exercise.

If    is open in the subspace topology, by Proposition 7.2.11, there is a set   

open in  such that  =   . Intersection of two open sets is open so  is open in .

Now suppose  is open in . Then  =   . So  is open in  again by

Proposition 7.2.11.

7.2.2 Connected sets

Let us generalize the idea of an interval to general metric spaces. One of the main features
of an interval in  is that it is connected--that we can continuously move from one point
of it to another point without jumping. For example, in  we usually study functions on
intervals, and in more general metric spaces we usually study functions on connected sets.

Definition 7.2.13. A nonempty metric space ( , ) is connected if the only subsets of 
that are both open and closed (so-called clopen subsets) are  and  itself. If a nonempty
( , ) is not connected we say it is disconnected.

    When we apply the term connected to a nonempty subset   , we mean that  with
the subspace topology is connected.

    In other words, a nonempty  is connected if whenever we write  = 1  2 where
1  2 =  and 1 and 2 are open, then either 1 =  or 2 = . So to show  is
disconnected, we need to find nonempty disjoint open sets 1 and 2 whose union is .
For subsets, we state this idea as a proposition. The proposition is illustrated in Figure 7.7.

Proposition 7.2.14. Let ( , ) be a metric space. A nonempty set    is disconnected if and
only if there exist open sets 1 and 2 in  such that 1  2   = , 1    , 2    ,
and

                                            = 1    2   .

     1    2

Figure 7.7: Disconnected subset. Notice that 1  2 need not be empty, but 1  2   = .

Proof. First suppose  is disconnected: There are nonempty disjoint 1 and 2 that are
open in  and  = 1  2. Proposition 7.2.11 says there exist 1 and 2 that are open in 
such that 1   = 1 and 2   = 2.

    For the other direction start with the 1 and 2. Then 1   and 2   are open in 
by Proposition 7.2.11. Via the discussion before the proposition,  is disconnected. 

Example 7.2.15: Suppose    and there are , ,  such that  <  <  with ,    and
  . Claim:  is disconnected. Proof: Notice

                                       (-, )    (, )   = .

     Some authors do not exclude the empty set from the definition, and the empty set would then be
connected. We avoid the empty set for essentially the same reason why 1 is neither a prime nor a composite
number: Our connected sets have exactly two clopen subsets and disconnected sets have more than two. The
empty set has exactly one.
7.2. OPEN AND CLOSED SETS                                          269

Proposition 7.2.16. A nonempty set    is connected if and only if  is an interval or a single
point.

Proof. Suppose  is connected. If  is a single point, then we are done. So suppose  < 

and ,   . If    is such that  <  < , then (-, )   is nonempty and (, )  

is nonempty. The two sets are disjoint. As  is connected, we must have they their union is

not , so   . By Proposition 1.4.1,  is an interval.

If  is a single point, it is connected. Therefore, suppose  is an interval. Consider open

subsets 1 and 2 of  such that 1  and 2  are nonempty, and  = 1   2  .
We will show that 1   and 2   contain a common point, so they are not disjoint,
proving that  is connected. Suppose   1   and   2  . Without loss of
generality, assume  < . As  is an interval, [, ]  . Note that 2  [, ]  , and let
 inf(2  [, ]). We wish to show that   1. If  = , then   1. If  > , then
for every  > 0, the ball (, ) = ( - ,  + ) contains points of [, ] not in 2, as  is
the infimum of 2  [, ]. So   2 as 2 is open. Therefore,   1 as every point of
[, ] is in 1 or 2. As 1 is open, (, )  1 for a small enough  > 0. As  is the
infimum of the nonempty set 2  [, ], there must exist some   2  [, ] such that
  [,  + )  (, )  1. Therefore,   1  2  [, ]. So 1   and 2   are

not disjoint, and  is connected. See Figure 7.8.                   

                                   1                    2
                                                                 

                                            ( - ,  + )

Figure 7.8: Proof that an interval is connected.

Example 7.2.17: Oftentimes a ball (, ) is connected, but this is not necessarily true in
every metric space. For a simplest example, take a two point space {, } with the discrete
metric. Then (, 2) = {, }, which is not connected as (, 1) = {} and (, 1) = {} are

open and disjoint.

7.2.3 Closure and boundary

Sometimes we wish to take a set and throw in everything that we can approach from the
set. This concept is called the closure.
Definition 7.2.18. Let ( , ) be a metric space and   . The closure of  is the set

                           {   :  is closed and   }.

That is,  is the intersection of all closed sets that contain .
270                                       CHAPTER 7. METRIC SPACES

Proposition 7.2.19. Let ( , ) be a metric space and   . The closure  is closed, and   .
Furthermore, if  is closed, then  = .

Proof. The closure is an intersection of closed sets, so  is closed. There is at least one

closed set containing , namely  itself, so   . If  is closed, then  is a closed set that

contains . So   , and thus  = .                                                     

Example 7.2.20: The closure of (0, 1) in  is [0, 1]. Proof: If  is closed and contains (0, 1),
then  contains 0 and 1 (why?). Thus [0, 1]  . But [0, 1] is also closed. Hence, the closure

(0, 1) = [0, 1].

Example 7.2.21: Be careful to notice what ambient metric space you are working with.
If  = (0, ), then the closure of (0, 1) in (0, ) is (0, 1]. Proof: Similarly as above, (0, 1]
is closed in (0, ) (why?). Any closed set  that contains (0, 1) must contain 1 (why?).

Therefore, (0, 1]  , and hence (0, 1) = (0, 1] when working in (0, ).

    Let us justify the statement that the closure is everything that we can "approach" from
within the set.

Proposition 7.2.22. Let ( , ) be a metric space and   . Then    if and only if for every
 > 0, (, )    .

Proof. Let us prove the two contrapositives. Let us show that    if and only if there

exists a  > 0 such that (, )   = . 
    First suppose   . We know  is closed. Thus there is a  > 0 such that (, )   .

As    we see that (, )     and hence (, )   = .

    On the other hand, suppose there is a  > 0 such that (, )   = . In other words,
  (, ). As (, ) is a closed set, as   (, ), and as  is the intersection of

closed sets containing , we have   .                                                

    We can also talk about the interior of a set (points we cannot approach from the
complement), and the boundary of a set (points we can approach both from the set and its
complement).

Definition 7.2.23. Let ( , ) be a metric space and   . The interior of  is the set

      {   : there exists a  > 0 such that (, )  }.

The boundary of  is the set    \ .

    Alternatively, the interior is the union of open sets lying in , see Exercise 7.2.14. By
definition,   ; however, the points of the boundary may or may not be in .

Example 7.2.24: Suppose      (0, 1] and   . Then  = [0, 1],  = (0, 1), and
 = {0, 1}.
7.2. OPEN AND CLOSED SETS                                           271

Example 7.2.25: Consider   {, } with the discrete metric, and let   {}. Then
 =  =  and  = .

Proposition 7.2.26. Let ( , ) be a metric space and   . Then  is open and  is closed.

Proof. Given   , there is a  > 0 such that (, )  . If   (, ), then as open
balls are open, there is an  > 0 such that (, )  (, )  . So   . Therefore,
(, )  , and so  is open.

As  is open, then  =  \  =   () is closed.                                                

    The boundary is the set of points that are close to both the set and its complement. See
Figure 7.9 for a diagram of the next proposition.

Proposition 7.2.27. Let ( , ) be a metric space and   . Then    if and only if for every
 > 0, (, )   and (, )   are both nonempty.

                               
                                                       
                                                             

                               (, )

Figure 7.9: Boundary is the set where every ball contains points in the set and also its
complement.

Proof. Suppose    =  \  and let  > 0 be arbitrary. By Proposition 7.2.22, (, )
contains a point of . If (, ) contained no points of , then  would be in . Hence
(, ) contains a point of  as well.

Let us prove the other direction by contrapositive. Suppose   , so    or   .
If   , then (, )   for some  > 0 as  is closed. So (, )   is empty, because
  . If   , then (, )   for some  > 0, so (, )   is empty.
                                                                                          

    We obtain the following immediate corollary about closures of  and . We simply
apply Proposition 7.2.22.

Corollary 7.2.28. Let ( , ) be a metric space and   . Then  =   .

7.3 Sequences and convergence

Note: 1 lecture

7.3.1 Sequences

The notion of a sequence in a metric space is very similar to a sequence of real numbers.

The related definitions are essentially the same as those for real numbers in the sense of
chapter 2, where  with the standard metric (, ) =  -  is replaced by an arbitrary
metric space ( , ).

Definition 7.3.1. A sequence in a metric space ( , ) is a function  :   . As before we
write  for the th element in the sequence, and for the whole sequence use the notation

                                                         {   }=1 .

    A   sequence    {   }       is   bounded    if   there  exists  a  point         and             such    that

                            =1

                                         (, )   for all   .

In  other  words,   the    sequence      {   }       is  bounded    whenever    the  set  {    :        }    is  bounded.
        {   }
    If                  a  sequence              =1                                  +1   >        for  all  ,   then
                =1  is                   of  natural     numbers       such  that                                      the
                    }                                            {   }=1 .
sequence   {               is  said  to  be  a  subsequence  of
                      =1

    Similarly we define convergence. See Figure 7.10, for an idea of the definition.

Definition  7.3.2.      A  sequence      {   }       in  a  metric  space     (, )   is  said  to  converge  to  a  point

                                                 =1
   if for every  > 0, there exists an    such that ( , ) <  for all   . The
point  is said to be a limit of {}=1. If the limit is unique, we write

                                                     lim  .

                                                     

    A sequence that converges is convergent. Otherwise, the sequence is divergent.

                                                                     8

                                                               10 2 1

                                                6                9
                                         573

Figure 7.10: Sequence converging to . The first 10 points are shown and  = 7 for this .
7.3. SEQUENCES AND CONVERGENCE                                                                                              275

    The limit is unique. The proof is almost identical (word for word) to the proof of the
same fact for sequences of real numbers, Proposition 2.1.6. Proofs of many results we
know for sequences of real numbers can be adapted to the more general settings of metric
spaces. We must replace  -  with (, ) in the proofs and apply the triangle inequality
correctly.

Proposition 7.3.3. A convergent sequence in a metric space has a unique limit.

Proof.  Suppose         {   }       has limits        and    .  Take an arbitrary        >     0.  From the definition

                                =1
find an 1 such that for all   1, ( , ) < /2. Similarly find an 2 such that for all
  2, we have ( , ) < /2. Now take an  such that   1 and also   2, and

estimate

                                              (, )  (, ) + (, )
                                                       <  +  = .

As (, ) <  for all  > 0, then (, ) = 0 and  = . Hence the limit (if it exists) is

unique.                                                                                                                        

The proofs of the following propositions are left as exercises.

Proposition 7.3.4. A convergent sequence in a metric space is bounded.

Proposition       7.3.5.  A  sequence     {   }       in  a  metric    space   ( ,  )  converges   to          if  and  only   if
                             {   }
there  exists     sequence                        =1                   that
               a                     =1   of  real  numbers     such

                          ( , )   for all   , and lim  = 0.

                                                                                                    

Proposition       7.3.6.  Let  {   }       be  a    sequence    in  a  metric  space   ( , ).

                                       =1

(i)     If  {   }       converges   to        ,     then  every  subsequence        {  }       converges   to  .

                    =1                                                                   =1

(ii)    If for some            the  -tail     {   }          converges  to          ,  then    {   }       converges    to  .

                                                      =+1                                              =1

Example 7.3.7: Take  [, ],  be the set of continuous functions with the metric being

the uniform norm. We saw that we obtain a metric space. If we look at the definition
                                                                                                                    { }
of convergence, we notice that it is identical to uniform convergence.                                   That  is,
                                                                                                                           =1
converges uniformly if and only if it converges in the metric space sense.

Remark 7.3.8. It is perhaps surprising that on the set of functions  : [, ]   (continuous
or not) there is no metric that gives pointwise convergence. Although the proof of this fact
is beyond the scope of this book.

7.3.2 Convergence in euclidean space

In the euclidean space , a sequence converges if and only if every component converges:
276                                                                                CHAPTER 7. METRIC SPACES

Proposition     7.3.9.   Let  {   }        be    a  sequence  in  ,    where             =  ,1, ,2, . . . , ,               .
      {   }                                          {, }=1
Then                                   =1                                                         =  1, 2, . . .  , ,
               =1  converges   if  and  only     if                converges       for   every                         in  which

case

                          lim  = lim ,1, lim ,2, . . . , lim , .
                                                                                   

Proof.   Suppose    {   }        converges to          = (1, 2, . . . , )                .    Given     >   0, there exists

                             =1
an  such that for all   , we have

                                                     (, ) < .

Fix some  = 1, 2, . . . , . For all   ,

                    - , =             - , 2                      

                                                                      - , 2 = (, ) < .

                                                                 =1

Hence the sequence {,}=1 converges to .
    For the other direction, suppose {,}=1 converges to  for every  = 1, 2, . . . , .

Given  > 0, pick an  such that if   , then  - , < / for all  = 1, 2, . . . , .

Then                                                                  2                       2 = .
                                                                          =                 =1 
                    (, ) =                 - , 2 <
                                                                    =1 
                                     =1

That  is,  the  sequence  {   }         converges        to     =   (1,  2,  .  .  .  ,  )      .                          

                                   =1

Example 7.3.10: As we said, the set  of complex numbers  =  +  is considered as the
                                                                             {   }                       }
metric   space  2.  The   proposition       says     that  the  sequence                    =   {    +             converges
                                     {   }                                           =1                        =1
to    =    +    if  and  only    if              converges      to    and  {  }             converges   to  .
                                             =1
                                                                                   =1

7.3.3 Convergence and topology

The topology--the set of open sets of a space--encodes which sequences converge.

Proposition 7.3.11.      Let   ( ,   )  be  a    metric  space    and  {   }             a sequence in .    Then       {   }

                                                                               =1                                              =1
converges to    if and only if for every open neighborhood  of , there exists an    such

that for all   , we have   .

Proof.   Suppose    {    }     converges to .          Let        be an open neighborhood of , then there

                           =1
exists an  > 0 such that (, )  . As the sequence converges, find an    such that

for all   , we have (, ) < , or in other words   (, )  .

    Let us prove the other direction. Given  > 0, let  (, ) be the neighborhood of .

Then there is an    such that for   , we have    = (, ), or in other words,
(, ) < .
                                                                                                                           

    A closed set contains the limits of its convergent sequences.

Proposition        7.3.12.      Let     (, )      be  a  metric        space,            a  closed    set,  and    {   }       a   sequence       in

 that converges to some   . Then   .                                                                                       =1

Proof.     Let us prove the contrapositive.                       Suppose          {   }       is  a  sequence        in    that converges

                                                                                           =1
to   . As  is open, Proposition 7.3.11 says that there is an  such that for all   ,
        .        {   }
            So                  is  not     a  sequence       in      .                                                                           
                         =1

    To take a closure of a set , we start with , and we throw in points that are limits of
sequences in .

Proposition 7.3.13. Let ( , ) be a metric space and   . Then    if and only if there
                            }
exists  a  sequence     {               of elements in  such that                  lim         =   .
                              =1                                                   

Proof. Let   . For every   , Proposition 7.2.22 guarantees a point   (, 1/)  .
As (, ) < 1/, we have lim  = .

    For the other direction, see Exercise 7.3.1.

7.4.1 Cauchy sequences and completeness

Just like with sequences of real numbers, we define Cauchy sequences.

Definition   7.4.1.  Let  ( ,  )   be  a  metric  space.  A  sequence  {   }       in    is  a  Cauchy  sequence

                                                                               =1
if for every  > 0, there exists an    such that for all    and all   , we have

                                                  (, ) < .

    The definition is again simply a translation of the concept from the real numbers to

metric spaces. A sequence of real numbers is Cauchy in the sense of chapter 2 if and only

if it is Cauchy in the sense above, provided we equip the real numbers with the standard
metric (, ) =  -  .

Proposition 7.4.2. A convergent sequence in a metric space is Cauchy.

Proof.  Suppose   {   }       converges   to  .     Given    >  0, there is an     such that for all      ,

                          =1
we have (, ) < /2. Hence for all ,   , we have ( , )  ( , ) + (, ) <
/2 + /2 = .
                                                                                                          

Definition 7.4.3. We say a metric space ( , ) is complete or Cauchy-complete if every Cauchy
          {   }
sequence              in    converges     to  a        .
                  =1

Proposition 7.4.4. The space  with the standard metric is a complete metric space.

    For  = 1, completeness was proved in chapter 2. The proof of completeness in  is
a reduction to the one-dimensional case.

Proof.  Let  {   }        be a Cauchy sequence in , where                =  ,1, ,2, . . . , ,            .

                      =1
As the sequence is Cauchy, given  > 0, there exists an  such that for all ,   ,

                                                  (, ) < .

Fix some  = 1, 2, . . . , . For ,   ,

             , - , =               , - , 2                 

                                                               , - , 2 = ( , ) < .

                                                           =1

Hence the sequence {,}=1 is Cauchy. As  is complete the sequence converges;
there exists a    such that  = lim ,. Write  = (1, 2, . . . , )  . By
                      {   }                              ,               
Proposition  7.3.9,                converges     to          and  hence     is     complete.              
                               =1
280                                                                               CHAPTER 7. METRIC SPACES

    In the language of metric spaces, the results on continuity of section §6.2, say that the
metric space  [, ],  of Example 7.1.8 is complete. The proof follows by "unrolling the

definitions," and is left as Exercise 7.4.7.

Proposition 7.4.5. The space of continuous functions  [, ],  with the uniform norm as
metric is a complete metric space.

A subset of a complete metric space such as  with the subspace metric need not be
                                                                                  as {1/}
complete.  For example,  (0, 1] with the subspace metric is not complete,                          is a
                                                                                               =1
Cauchy sequence in (0, 1] with no limit in (0, 1]. However, a closed subspace of a complete

metric space is complete. After all, one way to think of a closed set is that it contains all

points reachable from the set via a sequence. The proof is Exercise 7.4.16.

Proposition 7.4.6. Suppose ( , ) is a complete metric space and    is closed. Then  is a
complete metric space with the subspace metric.

7.4.2 Compactness

Definition 7.4.7. Let ( , ) be a metric space and   . The set  is said to be compact if
for every collection of open sets {} such that

                                                     ,

                                                                              

there exists a finite subset {1, 2, . . . , }   such that

                                                                               

                                                      .

                                                                              =1

    A collection of open sets {} as above is said to be an open cover of . A way to say
that  is compact is to say that every open cover of  has a finite subcover.

Example 7.4.8: Let  be the metric space with the standard metric.

The set  is not compact. Proof: For   , let  (-, ). Any    is in some

 (by the Archimedean property), so we have an open cover. Suppose we have a finite
subcover   1  2  · · ·   , and suppose 1 < 2 < · · · < . Then    , but that
is a contradiction as    on one hand and    = (- , ) on the other.
The set (0, 1)   is also not compact. Proof: Take the sets  (1/, 1 - 1/) for
 = 3, 4, 5, . . .. As above (0, 1) =  
                                            And similarly as above,               if there exists a finite
                                      =3 .
subcover, then there is one  such that (0, 1)  , which again leads to a contradiction.
The set {0}   is compact. Proof: Given an open cover {}, there must exist a 0
such that 0  0 as it is a cover. But then 0 gives a finite subcover.
We will prove below that [0, 1], and in fact every closed and bounded interval [, ], is

compact.

Proposition 7.4.9. Let ( , ) be a metric space. If    is compact, then  is closed and
bounded.
7.4. COMPLETENESS AND COMPACTNESS                                                 281

Proof. First, we prove that a compact set is bounded. Fix   . We have the open cover

                                                                        

                                               (, ) = .

                                                                       =1

If  is compact, then there exists some set of indices 1 < 2 < . . . <  such that

                                                                 

                                           (, ) = (, ).

                                                                 =1

As  is contained in a ball,  is bounded. See the left-hand side of Figure 7.11.

Next, we show a set that is not closed is not compact. Suppose   , that is, there is a

point    \ . If   , then   (, 1/) for    such that 1/ < (, ). Furthermore,

  , so                         

                        (, 1/) .

                               =1

A closed ball is closed, so its complement (, 1/) is open, and we have an open cover. If

we take any finite collection of indices 1 < 2 < . . . < , then

                      

                          (, 1/) = (, 1/)

                      =1

As  is in the closure of , then (, 1/)    . So there is no finite subcover and  is

not compact. See the right-hand side of Figure 7.11.                              

                      3                                                 (, 1/4)
               12       (, 1)                                           (, 1/3)
                                                                        (, 1/2)

Figure 7.11: Proving compact set is bounded (left) and closed (right).

    We prove below that in a finite-dimensional euclidean space, every closed bounded set
is compact. So closed bounded sets of  are examples of compact sets. It is not true that

in every metric space, closed and bounded is equivalent to compact. A simple example
is an incomplete metric space such as (0, 1) with the subspace metric from . There are
282                                               CHAPTER 7. METRIC SPACES

many complete and very useful metric spaces where closed and bounded is not enough to
give compactness:  [, ],  is a complete metric space, but the closed unit ball (0, 1) is
not compact, see Exercise 7.4.8. However, see also Exercise 7.4.12.

    Not worrying about the boundedness for a moment, note further the difference between
being closed and being compact. Being closed depends on the ambient metric space: The
set (0, 1] is not closed in , but it is closed in the subspace (0, ). However, a set  is
compact in some metric space ( , ) if and only if it is compact in the subspace metric on .
So for a compact set, we do not have to ask what metric space it lives in. On the other hand,
every set is always closed in the subspace metric as a subset of itself. See also Exercise 7.4.6.

    A useful property of compact sets in a metric space is that every sequence in the set has
a convergent subsequence converging to a point in the set. Such sets are called sequentially
compact. We will prove that in the context of metric spaces, a set is compact if and only if it
is sequentially compact. First we prove a lemma.

Lemma 7.4.10 (Lebesgue covering lemma). Let ( , ) be a metric space and   . Suppose
every sequence in  has a subsequence convergent in . Given an open cover {} of , there
exists a  > 0 such that for every   , there exists a    with (, )  .

Proof. We prove the lemma by contrapositive. If the conclusion is not true, then there is
an open cover {} of  with the following property. For every   , there exists an
   such that ( , 1/) is not a subset of any . Take any   . There is a    such
that   . As  is open, there is an  > 0 such that (, )  . Take  such that
1/ < /2. If   (, /2) and   , then

           (, 1/)  (, 1/)  (, /2)  (, )  ,

where (, /2)  (, ) follows by triangle inequality. See Figure 7.12. Thus   .
In other words, for all   ,   (, /2). The sequence cannot have a subsequence
converging to . As    was arbitrary we are done.
                                                                                

     It is important to recognize what the lemma says. It says that if  is sequentially

compact, then given any cover there is a single  > 0. The  depends on the cover, but, of

course, it does not depend on .

    For example, let  [-10, 10] and let  (,  + 2) for    give an open cover.
Consider   . There is an   , such that    <  + 1. If    <  + 1/2, then

 , 1/2  -1. If  + 1/2   <  + 1, then  , 1/2  . So  = 1/2 will do. The sets
      +2   , again give an open cover, but now the largest  that works is 1/4.

     2, 2
     On the other hand,    is not sequentially compact. It is an exercise to find a cover

for which no  > 0 works.

Theorem 7.4.11. Let ( , ) be a metric space. Then    is compact if and only if every
sequence in  has a subsequence converging to a point in .

     Named after the French mathematician Henri Léon Lebesgue (1875-1941). The number  is sometimes
called the Lebesgue number of the cover.

                                               (, )

Figure 7.12: Proof of Lebesgue covering lemma. Note that (, /2)  (, ) by triangle
inequality.

Proof.  Claim:  Let               be a subset of        and   {   }       a sequence in  .    Suppose that for each

                                                                      =1
  , there is a ball (, ) for some  > 0 such that   (, ) for only finitely many
  . Then  is not compact.

Proof of the claim: Notice

                                                 (, ).

                                                       

Any  finite  collection  of  these    balls    contains   at  most  finitely  many  elements        of  {    } ,   and

                                                                                                               =1
so there must be an    not in their union. Hence,  is not compact and the claim is

proved.                                               {   }

So suppose that              is   compact      and            =1  is a sequence in .     Then there exists an

   such that for all  > 0, (, ) contains  for infinitely many   . We define the
subsequence inductively. The ball (, 1) contains some , so let 1 . Suppose -1
is defined. There must exist a  > -1 such that   (, 1/). Define  . We now
                           {          }               (,   )      1/,
posses  a   subsequence                     .  Since          <        Proposition  7.3.5     says  lim            =  .
                                        =1
For the other direction, suppose every sequence in  has a subsequence converging

in . Take an open cover {} of . Using the Lebesgue covering lemma above, find a
 > 0 such that for every   , there is a    with (, )  .

    Pick 1   and find 1   such that (1, )  1. If   1, we stop as we
have found a finite subcover. Otherwise, there must be a point 2   \ 1. Note that
(2, 1)  . There must exist some 2   such that (2, )  2. We work inductively.
Suppose -1 is defined. Either 1  2  · · ·  -1 is a finite cover of , in which case
we stop, or there must be a point    \ 1  2  · · ·  -1 . Note that ( , )  
for all  = 1, 2, . . . ,  - 1. Next, there must be some    such that ( , )   . See

Figure 7.13.

Either at some point we obtain a finite subcover of , or we obtain an infinite sequence
{   }
            as  above.  For contradiction, suppose that there is no finite subcover and we
        =1

first three balls of radius  are drawn.

Example 7.4.12: Theorem 2.3.8, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem for sequences of real

numbers, says that every bounded sequence in  has a convergent subsequence. Therefore,
every sequence in a closed interval [, ]   has a convergent subsequence. The limit is
also in [, ] as limits preserve non-strict inequalities. Hence a closed bounded interval
[, ]   is (sequentially) compact.

Proposition 7.4.13. Let ( , ) be a metric space and let    be compact. If    is a closed
set, then  is compact.

    Because  is closed,  is closed in  if and only if it is closed in . See Proposition 7.2.12.

Proof.  Let  {   }       be  a  sequence       in    .  It is also a sequence in .     Therefore, it has a
                                         }

a sequence in  is also in  and so   . Thus  must be compact.                                                   

Theorem 7.4.14 (Heine-Borel). A closed bounded subset    is compact.

    So subsets of  are compact if and only if they are closed and bounded, a condition
that is much easier to check. Let us reiterate that the Heine-Borel theorem only holds for
 and not for metric spaces in general. The theorem does not hold even for subspaces of
, just in  itself. In general, compact implies closed and bounded, but not vice versa.

Proof. For  = 1, suppose    is closed and bounded. Then   [, ] for some closed
and bounded interval, which is compact by Example 7.4.12. As  is a closed subset of a

compact set, it is compact by Proposition 7.4.13.
    We carry out the proof for  = 2 and leave arbitrary  as an exercise. As   2 is

bounded, there exists a set  = [, ] × [, ]  2 such that   . We will show that  is
compact. Then , being a closed subset of a compact , is also compact.

                              

    Let ( , ) =1 be a sequence in . That is,      and      for all . A
bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence so there is a subsequence

     Named after the German mathematician Heinrich Eduard Heine (1821-1881), and the French mathe-
matician Félix Édouard Justin Émile Borel (1871-1956).

exists      a   subsequence                 =1   that  is  convergent.   A    subsequence      of  a  convergent  sequence

By Proposition 7.3.9, ( ,  ) =1  converges to (, ). Furthermore, as      and
     for all , we know that (, )  .                                                                                   

Example 7.4.15: The discrete metric provides interesting counterexamples again. Let ( , )
be a metric space with the discrete metric, that is, (, ) = 1 if   . Suppose  is an
infinite set. Then

   (i) ( , ) is a complete metric space.

  (ii) Any subset    is closed and bounded.

 (iii) A subset    is compact if and only if it is a finite set.

 (iv) The conclusion of the Lebesgue covering lemma is always satisfied, e.g. with  = 1/2,
       even for noncompact   .

The proofs of the statements above are either trivial or are relegated to the exercises below.

Remark 7.4.16. A subtle issue with Cauchy sequences, completeness, compactness, and
convergence is that compactness and convergence only depend on the topology, that is,
on which sets are the open sets. On the other hand, Cauchy sequences and completeness
depend on the actual metric. See Exercise 7.4.19.

7.5 Continuous functions

Note: 1.5-2 lectures

7.5.1 Continuity

Definition 7.5.1. Let ( , ) and (, ) be metric spaces and   . Then  :    is
continuous at  if for every  > 0 there is a  > 0 such that whenever    and (, ) < ,
then   (),  () < .

    When  :    is continuous at all   , we simply say that  is a continuous function.

    The definition agrees with the definition from chapter 3 when  is a real-valued function
on the real line--as long as we take the standard metric on , of course.

Proposition 7.5.2. Let ( , ) and (, ) be metric spaces. Then  :    is continuous at
                                                                                                
   if and only if for every sequence {}=1 in  converging to , the sequence  () =1
converges to  ().

Proof.  Suppose    is continuous at .  Let  {   }       be  a  sequence  in    converging to .  Given

                                                    =1
 > 0, there is a  > 0 such that (, ) <  implies   (),  () < . So take  such
that for all   , we have ( , ) < , then   (),  () < . Hence  () =1 
converges to  ().

On the other hand, suppose  is not continuous at . Then there exists an  > 0, such that

for every    there exists an   , with ( , ) < 1/ such that   (),  ()  .
                                            
Then {}=1 converges to , but  () =1 does not converge to  ().                                     

Example 7.5.3: Suppose  : 2   is a polynomial. That is,

           -

 (, ) =               = 0 0 + 1 0  + 0 1  + 2 0 2 + 1 1  + 0 2 2 + · · · + 0  ,

          =0 =0

for some    (the degree) and   . We claim  is continuous. Let ( , ) =1  be a
sequence in 2 that converges to (, )  2. We proved that this means lim  = 
and lim  = . By Proposition 2.2.5,

                             -                                  -

          lim  ( , ) = lim                     =                         =  (, ).
                    =0 =0
                                                               =0 =0

So  is continuous at (, ), and as (, ) was arbitrary  is continuous everywhere.
Similarly, a polynomial in  variables is continuous.

    Be careful about taking limits separately. Consider  : 2   defined by  (, )
2+2  outside the origin and  (0, 0) 0. See Figure 7.14. In Exercise 7.5.2, you are
asked to prove that  is not continuous at the origin. However, for every , the function
()  (, ) is continuous, and for every , the function ()  (, ) is continuous.
7.5. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS                                                                         289

Figure 7.14: Graph of 2+2  .

Example 7.5.4: Let  be a metric space and  :    a complex-valued function. Write

 () = () +  (), where  :    and  :    are the real and imaginary parts of  .

Then  is continuous at    if and only if its real and imaginary parts are continuous at .

                                                                                            
This fact follows because  () = () +  () =1 converges to  () = () +  () if
                                                       
and only if () =1 converges to () and () =1 converges to ().

7.5.2 Compactness and continuity

Continuous maps do not map closed sets to closed sets. For example,  : (0, 1)   defined
by  ()  takes the set (0, 1), which is closed in (0, 1), to the set (0, 1), which is not closed

in . On the other hand, continuous maps do preserve compact sets.

Lemma 7.5.5. Let ( , ) and (, ) be metric spaces and  :    a continuous function. If
   is a compact set, then  () is a compact set.

                                                                             
Proof. A sequence in  () can be written as  () =1, where {}=1 is a sequence in .
The  set    is  compact  and  therefore  there  is  a  subsequence  {  }     that  converges  to  some

  . By continuity,                                                       =1

                              lim  ( ) =  ()   ().

                              

So every sequence in  () has a subsequence convergent to a point in  (), and  () is

compact by Theorem 7.4.11.                                                                        

As before,  :    achieves an absolute minimum at    if

                               ()   () for all   .

On the other hand,  achieves an absolute maximum at    if

                               ()   () for all   .
290          CHAPTER 7. METRIC SPACES

Theorem 7.5.6. Let ( , ) be a nonempty compact metric space and let  :    be continuous.
Then  is bounded and in fact  achieves an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum on .

Proof. As  is compact and  is continuous,  ()   is compact. Hence  () is closed

and bounded. In particular, sup  ()   () and inf  ()   (), because both the sup

and the inf can be achieved by sequences in  () and  () is closed. Therefore, there is

some    such that  () = sup  () and some    such that  () = inf  ().                      

7.5.3 Continuity and topology

Let us see how to define continuity in terms of the topology, that is, the open sets. We have
already seen that topology determines which sequences converge, and so it is no wonder
that the topology also determines continuity of functions.

Lemma 7.5.7. Let ( , ) and (, ) be metric spaces. A function  :    is continuous at
   if and only if for every open neighborhood  of  () in , the set  -1() contains an open
neighborhood of  in . See Figure 7.15.

       -1()

       

              ()

Figure 7.15: For every neighborhood  of  (), the set  -1() contains an open neighborhood
 of .

Proof. First suppose that  is continuous at . Let  be an open neighborhood of  () in
, then   (),    for some  > 0. By continuity of  , there exists a  > 0 such that
whenever  is such that (, ) < , then   (),  () < . In other words,

       (, )   -1   (),    -1(),

and (, ) is an open neighborhood of .                          contains an open
    For the other direction, let  > 0 be given. If  -1   (), 

neighborhood  of , it contains a ball. That is, there is some  > 0 such that

      (, )     -1   (),  .

That means precisely that if (, ) < , then   (),  () < . So  is continuous

at .                                                                                      
7.5. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS                       291

Theorem 7.5.8. Let ( , ) and (, ) be metric spaces. A function  :    is continuous if
and only if for every open   ,  -1() is open in .

    The proof follows from Lemma 7.5.7 and is left as an exercise.

Example 7.5.9: Let  :    be a continuous function. Theorem 7.5.8 tells us that if   
is closed, then  -1() =  \  -1() is also closed. Therefore, if we have a continuous
function  :   , then the zero set of  , that is,  -1(0) =    :  () = 0 , is closed.
We have just proved the most basic result in algebraic geometry, the study of zero sets of
polynomials: The zero set of a polynomial is closed.

    Similarly, the set where  is nonnegative,  -1 [0, ) =    :  ()  0 , is closed.
On the other hand, the set where  is positive,  -1 (0, ) =    :  () > 0 , is open.

7.5.4 Uniform continuity

As for continuous functions on the real line, in the definition of continuity it is sometimes
convenient to be able to pick one  for all points.

Definition 7.5.10. Let ( , ) and (, ) be metric spaces. Then  :    is uniformly
continuous if for every  > 0 there is a  > 0 such that whenever ,    and (, ) < ,
we have   (),  () < .

    A uniformly continuous function is continuous, but not necessarily vice versa as we
have seen.

Theorem 7.5.11. Let ( , ) and (, ) be metric spaces. Suppose  :    is continuous
and  is compact. Then  is uniformly continuous.

Proof. Let  > 0 be given. For each   , pick  > 0 such that   (),  () < /2
whenever   (, ). The balls (, ) cover , and the space  is compact. Apply the
Lebesgue covering lemma to obtain a  > 0 such that for every   , there is a    for
which (, )  (, ).

    Suppose ,    where (, ) < . Find a    such that (, )  (, ). Then
  (, ). By the triangle inequality and the definition of ,

  (),  ()    (),  () +   (),  () < /2 + /2 = .  

    As an application of uniform continuity, we prove a useful criterion for continuity of
functions defined by integrals. Let  (, ) be a function of two variables and define

                           

()                            (, ) .

Question is, is  is continuous? We are really asking when do two limiting operations

commute, which is not always possible, so some extra hypothesis is necessary. A useful
sufficient (but not necessary) condition is that  is continuous on a closed rectangle.
292                                              CHAPTER 7. METRIC SPACES

Proposition 7.5.12. If  : [, ] × [, ]   is continuous, then  : [, ]   defined by

                    

                ()              (, )   is continuous.

Proof. Fix   [, ] and let  > 0 be given. As  is continuous on [, ] × [, ], which is

compact,  is uniformly continuous. In particular, there exists a  > 0 such that whenever
                                                  
  [, ] and  -   < , we have     (, ) -  (, )  <  -  for  all      [, ].  So suppose

 -  < . Then

                    

() - () =        (, )  -  (, ) 
                             

                                 =  (, ) -  (, )   ( - )  = . 
                                                                  -

    In applications, if we are interested in continuity at 0, we just need to apply the
proposition in [, ] × [0 - , 0 + ] for some small  > 0. For example, if  is continuous
in [, ] × , then  is continuous on .

Example 7.5.13: Useful examples of uniformly continuous functions are again the so-
called Lipschitz continuous functions. That is, if ( , ) and (, ) are metric spaces, then
 :    is called Lipschitz or -Lipschitz if there exists a    such that

                              (),  ()   (, ) for all ,   .

A Lipschitz function is uniformly continuous: Take  = /. A function can be uniformly
                                                                 

continuous but not Lipschitz, as we already saw:  on [0, 1] is uniformly continuous but
not Lipschitz.

    It is worth mentioning that, if a function is Lipschitz, it tends to be easiest to simply
show it is Lipschitz even if we are only interested in knowing continuity.

7.5.5 Cluster points and limits of functions

While we have not started the discussion of continuity with them and we will not need
them until volume II, let us also translate the idea of a limit of a function from the real line
to metric spaces. Again we need to start with cluster points.

Definition 7.5.14. Let ( , ) be a metric space and   . A point    is called a cluster
point of  if for every  > 0, the set (, )   \ {} is not empty.

    It is not enough that  is in the closure of , it must be in the closure of  \ {} (exercise).
So,  is a cluster point if and only if there exists a sequence in  \ {} that converges to .
7.5. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS                                                                                   293

Definition 7.5.15. Let ( , ), (, ) be metric spaces,   ,    a cluster point of ,
and  :    a function. Suppose there exists an    and for every  > 0, there exists a
 > 0 such that whenever    \ {} and (, ) < , then

                                         (),  < .

Then we say  () converges to  as  goes to , and  is a limit of  () as  goes to . If  is
unique, we write

                                                  lim  () .

                                                                    

If  () does not converge as  goes to , we say  diverges at .

    As usual, we prove that the limit, if it exists, is unique. The proof is a direct translation
of the proof from chapter 3, so we leave it as an exercise.

Proposition 7.5.16. Let ( , ) and (, ) be metric spaces,   ,    a cluster point of ,
and let  :    be a function such that  () converges as  goes to . Then the limit of  () as
 goes to  is unique.

    In any metric space, just like in , continuous limits may be replaced by sequential
limits. The proof is again a direct translation of the proof from chapter 3, and we leave it as
an exercise. The upshot is that we really only need to prove things for sequential limits.

Lemma 7.5.17. Let ( , ) and (, ) be metric spaces,   ,    a cluster point of , and
let  :    be a function.
                                                                                            {   }
Then    ()  converges  to        as    goes  to    if  and  only  if  for  every  sequence              in   \{}
                                                                                                    =1
such that lim  = , the sequence  () =1 converges to .

    By applying Proposition 7.5.2 or the definition directly we find (exercise) as in chapter 3,
that for cluster points  of   , the function  :    is continuous at  if and only if

                                       lim  () =  ().

7.6 Fixed point theorem and Picard's theorem again

Note: 1 lecture (optional, does not require §6.3)

    In this section we prove the fixed point theorem for contraction mappings. As an
application we prove Picard's theorem, which we proved without metric spaces in §6.3.
The proof presented here is similar, but the proof goes a lot smoother with metric spaces
and the fixed point theorem.

7.6.1 Fixed point theorem

Definition 7.6.1. Let ( , ) and (, ) be metric spaces. A map  :    is a contraction
(or a contractive map) if it is a -Lipschitz map for some  < 1, i.e. if there exists a  < 1
such that

                             (), ()   (, ) for all ,   .

Given a map  :   , a point    is called a fixed point if () = .

Theorem 7.6.2 (Contraction mapping principle or Banach fixed point theorem). Let ( , )
be a nonempty complete metric space and  :    a contraction. Then  has a unique fixed

point.

The words complete and contraction are necessary. See Exercise 7.6.6.

Proof.  Pick 0    .  Define  a  sequence  {   }       by  +1  (). Then

                                                  =1

                     (+1, ) =  (), (-1)  ( , -1).

Repeating  times, we get (+1, )   (1, 0). For  > ,

                                -1

                     ( , )  (+1, )

                                =

                                    -1

                                 (1, 0)

                                =

                                          --1

                                = (1, 0)                  

                                                          =0

                                  (1, 0)  =   (1, 0) 1 .
                                                  =0 1 - 

In particular, the sequence is Cauchy (why?). Since  is complete, we let   lim ,
and we claim that  is our unique fixed point.

Named after the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach (1892-1945) who first stated the theorem in 1922.
7.6. FIXED POINT THEOREM AND PICARD'S THEOREM AGAIN                                          297

Fixed point? The function  is a contraction, so it is Lipschitz continuous:

                      () =  lim  = lim () = lim +1 = .
                                                               

Unique? Let  and  be fixed points.

                             (, ) =  (), ()   (, ).

As  < 1, the inequality means that (, ) = 0, and hence  = . The theorem is proved. 

    The proof is constructive. Not only do we know a unique fixed point exists, we know
how to find it. Start with any point 0  , then iterate (0), ((0)), (((0))), etc.
to find better and better approximations. We can even find how far away from the fixed

point we are, see the exercises. The idea of the proof is therefore useful in real-world

applications.

7.6.2 Picard's theorem

We start with the metric space where we will apply the fixed point theorem: the space

 [, ],  of Example 7.1.8, the space of continuous functions  : [, ]   with the

metric

                         (  , )       - [,] = sup  () - () .

                                                             [,]

Convergence in this metric is convergence in uniform norm, or in other words, uniform
convergence. Therefore,  [, ],  is a complete metric space, see Proposition 7.4.5.

Consider now the ordinary differential equation

                                                    = (, ).
Given some 0, 0, we desire a function  =  () such that  (0) = 0 and such that

                                       () =  ,  () .

To avoid having to come up with many names, we often simply write  = (, ) for the

equation and () for the solution.
    The simplest example is the equation  = , (0) = 1. The solution is the exponential

() = . A somewhat more complicated example is  = -2 , (0) = 1, whose solution

is the Gaussian () = -2.
    A subtle issue is how long does the solution exist. Consider the equation  = 2,

(0)  =  1.  Then  ()  =   1  is  a  solution.  While    is  a  reasonably  "nice"  function  and  in
                         1-
particular it exists for all  and , the solution "blows up" at  = 1. For more examples

related to Picard's theorem, see §6.3.
298  CHAPTER 7. METRIC SPACES

    We will look for the solution in  [, ],  , which may feel strange at first as we
are searching for a differentiable function. The explanation is that we consider the
corresponding integral equation

                                                     
                                         () = 0 +  ,  () .

                                                                               0

To solve this integral equation, we only need a continuous function, so in some sense our
task should be easier--we have more candidate functions to try. This way of thinking is
quite typical when solving differential equations.

Theorem 7.6.3 (Picard's theorem on existence and uniqueness). Let ,    be closed and
bounded intervals, let  and  be their interiors, and let (0, 0)   × . Suppose  :  ×   
is continuous and Lipschitz in the second variable, that is, there exists an    such that

                         (, ) - (, )    -  for all ,   ,   .

Then there exists an  > 0 such that [0 - , 0 + ]   and a unique differentiable function
 : [0 - , 0 + ]     such that

                                 () =  ,  () and  (0) = 0.

Proof. Without loss of generality, assume 0 = 0 (exercise). As  ×  is compact and  is
continuous,  is bounded. So find an  > 0 such that (, )   for all (, )   × .
Pick  > 0 such that [-, ]   and [0 - , 0 + ]  . Let

                                             min ,   +  .
Note [-, ]  . Let

                                  [-, ],  :  [-, ]   .

That is,  is the set of continuous functions on [-, ] with values in , in other words,
exactly those functions where  ,  () makes sense. It is left as an exercise to show
that  is a closed subset of  [-, ],  (because  is closed). The space  [-, ],  is
complete, and a closed subset of a complete metric space is a complete metric space with
the subspace metric, see Proposition 7.4.6. So  with the subspace metric is a complete
metric space. We will write (  , ) =   - [-,] for this metric.

    Define a mapping  :    [-, ],  by
                                                       

                                     (  )() 0 +  ,  () .

                                                                                  0

It is an exercise to check that  is well-defined, and that for   , (  ) really is in
 [-, ],  . Let    and ||  . As  is bounded by , we have

                                                 
                              (  )() - 0 =  ,  () 

                                                                         0

                                                 ||       +   .
7.6. FIXED POINT THEOREM AND PICARD'S THEOREM AGAIN                                                     299

So (  ) [-, ]  [0 - , 0 + ]  , and (  )  . In other words, ()  . From now
on, we consider  as a mapping of  to .

    We claim  :    is a contraction. First, for   [-, ] and  ,   , we have

                          ,  () -  , ()    () - ()   (  , ).

Therefore,

                                      

              (  )() - ()()        =        ,  ()    -  , ()              
                                                      (  , ) 
                                        0                                    
                                                                           + 
                                    ||  (  , )                                      (  , ).

We  chose     >  0  and  so      <  1.  Take  supremum     over           [-  ,  ]  of  the  left-hand  side
                             +        
above to obtain  (  ), ()           +      (  ,  ),  that  is,   is  a  contraction.

    The fixed point theorem (Theorem 7.6.2) gives a unique    such that (  ) =  . In

other words,                                   
                                  () = 0 +  ,  () .

                                                        0

Clearly,  (0) = 0. By the fundamental theorem of calculus (Theorem 5.3.3),  is differen-
tiable and its derivative is  ,  () . Differentiable functions are continuous, so  is the
unique differentiable  : [-, ]   such that  () =  ,  () and  (0) = 0.
