                1.4: Rates and Proportions

Group Activity

1. List 3 things in life that are generally proportional and 3 things that are not generally
    proportional.

Unit Rates

2. Would you rather buy a box of 90 zipper sandwich bags for $1.79, a box of 150 for $2.79
    or a box of 280 for $5.69? Calculate the unit price for each. Assume they are all the same
    brand and the brand you want to buy.

Solving Proportion Problems

Use any method to solve these problems. Show your steps so we can follow your thinking.

3. Thai made $87,000 in gross income last year and paid $15,051 in taxes. If tax rates are
    proportional, how much should someone who makes $1,000,000 pay? Do you think tax
    rates are proportional?

4. A crepe recipe calls for 2 eggs, 3/4 cup of flour and 1 cup of milk. How much flour would
    you need if you use 5 eggs?

5. The Daytona 500 NASCAR race is 200 laps and 500 miles. The best time is 3 hours and 27
    minutes. If a driver could keep that same average speed, how long would it take them to
    finish the South Point 400 which is 267 laps and 400.5 miles.

Problems with unit conversions and/or geometry

It may be helpful to recall some formulas for areas and volumes of a few basic shapes.

Areas               Circle, radius r
Rectangle
Area: L W           Area: r2
Perimeter: 2L + 2W  Circumference = 2r

                                                                   radius
W

         L

Volumes             Cylinder
Rectangular Box     Volume: r2H
Volume: L·W·H
                                 r

H                   H

             L

6. Painting a wall rates - scaling a ratio. Sally can paint a 10x10 foot wall in 2 hours. At the
    same rate, how long would it take her to paint a 30x8 foot wall? Do you think the rates
    would be the same? What are some factors that would affect this?

7. Now Sally is painting all 4 walls in a 10x12x9 foot room. At the same rate, how long would
    it take her to paint this room. Do you think her rate would actually be the same as for the
    single wall? Why or why not?

9. Would you rather purchase Shake Mix A for $23 OR Shake Mix B for $110?

Whichever answer you choose, justify your reasoning with mathematics.

What other information would you like to know about Shake A and/or Shake B? How would
that information influence your decision?
