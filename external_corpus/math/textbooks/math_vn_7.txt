          4.1: Contingency Tables

Relating Venn Diagrams to Contingency Tables:

250 households were surveyed and 180 said they have a cat, 95 said they have a dog, and 52
said they have a cat and a dog. Fill in the Venn diagram and the contingency table.

Cat       Dog                                         Dog No Dog Total

                                               Cat

               No Cat

                                               Total

4 types of probabilities: Marginal, AND, OR, Conditional, using contingency tables
MARGINAL

         Find the probability that a randomly selected person from the study has a cat.

         P(cat) =

AND
         Find the probability that a randomly chosen person from the study has a cat AND a
         dog.

         P(cat AND dog) =

OR
         Find the probability that a randomly chosen person from the study has a cat OR no
         dog.

         P(cat OR no dog) =

CONDITIONAL
         Given that a person from the study has a dog, what is the chance they have a cat?

         P(cat given dog) =

                                4.2: Fundamentals of Probability

Three Types of Probabilities, Theoretical, Empirical, Subjective

Theoretical Probability- Based on counting equally likely outcomes

Example 1. You have a
quarter, a dime, and a nickel.
You toss them in the air, and
record whether they land on
heads or tails.

a. Draw a tree to see the
    possible outcomes.

b. Can you think of a way to
    multiply to find the
    number of outcomes?
    (Multiplication Principle)

c. What is the probability of getting 3  d. exactly 1 head?
    heads?

Theoretical Probability Model: We are interested in the number of heads, so we will list the
possible outcomes for the number of heads, along with the probability of getting each.
Number
of Heads

Probability

e. What is the probability of getting 1  f. What is the probability of getting
    or2 heads?                               fewer than 2 heads?

g. What is the probability of not        h. What is the probability of getting at
    getting 2 heads (Complement)?            least one head? (Complement of
                                             none)

Empirical Probability (Relative Frequency) - Based on observations or an experiment
15% of the parts sampled were found to be defective, so there is a 15% chance that a
randomly selected part will be defective.

Subjective Probability - Based on intuition, experience or feeling
What's the chance you will go to the party on Friday?

Relationship between Odds and Probability

Example 2. A team is given odds of winning of 4:7. What is the chance they will win? Lose?

Gambling Odds: "odds on" means "odds against"

Example 3. At a horse race, the odds on My Little Pony are given as 8 to 1. What is the
probability of My Little Pony winning and losing? The 8 to 1 odds mean that for every $1 you
bet on My Little Pony, you get $8 if you win. If you bet $10 and My Little Pony wins, how
much do you win?

                            Combining Probabilities

Example 4. You have 10 prizes in a bag and people are going to draw them at random. Two

are yellow erasers, one is a yellow calculator, three are green calculators and four are red

erasers. First, let's find the individual probabilities:

P(YE)=          P(YC)=      P(GC)=                        P(RE)=

P(Calculator)=  P(Eraser)=  P(Red)=                       P(Yellow)=  P(Green)=

"Or" Events (Single Draw)                                 "And" Events (Multiple Draws)

              Add          Add                   Multiply                    Multiply
( or ) = () + ()   Be careful not to  ( and ) = ()  ()                     Change the
                   double count the                                   probability for each

                      intersection                                             draw

"Or" Events
a. What is the probability of drawing a yellow or green item?

b. What is the probability of drawing a red item or an eraser?

"And" Events
c. If we put the items back in each time, (draw with replacement), what is the probability of

    drawing three red erasers in a row?

d. If we do not put the marbles back in each time, (draw without replacement), what is the
    probability of drawing three red erasers in a row?

             4.3: The Law of Large Numbers and Expected Value

The Law of Large Numbers:
In an experiment with independent trials, as you increase the number of trials the relative
frequency gets closer to the theoretical probability.

Example 1. Theo rolled a standard 6-sided die 1,000 times and recorded that the number 2
came up 100 times. He suspects that the die is not fair. Is he correct?

Gambler's Fallacy:
The mistaken belief that a streak or run of bad luck will make the opposite outcome more
likely.

Expected Value:
The long run average or mean value for many repeated samples.

The expected value is an        that is weighted by the                                      .

Example 2. A lottery ticket has five possible prize amounts and the chances of winning each
are shown in the probability model.

Prize                     $1 $10 $50 $1000                            0

Probability               1  1  1                            1  1539=0.7695

                          5  50 100 2000                        2000

a. Find the expected value for this lottery ticket.

         b. If the cost of the ticket is $2, what are your expected winnings?

Example 3. Primo Insurance sells an annual car insurance policy for $1,350. Based on past
data collected, an average of 1 in 50 policyholders will file a $6,000 claim, an average of 1 in
100 policyholders will file a $15,000 claim, and an average of 1 in 300 policyholders will file a
$33,000 claim.

         Insurance Payout
         Probability

         a. Find the expected value for the amount that Primo will pay per policy.

         b. What is the expected profit or loss per policy?              Page 4
