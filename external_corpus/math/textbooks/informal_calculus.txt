Welcome to Informal Calculus! This book came from teaching Survey of Calculus at the University of
Montana Western. You'll find that this book reflects the needs of that course, which are:

        Intuition behind the main concepts of calculus,
        Short, to-the-point explanations about how to do calculations,
        Build-in review for algebra along the way, with trigonometry not being a pre-requisite
        Applications to biology and environmental science, the two main science majors at my

           university.

A huge thanks to my collaborators for this project: Michelle Anderson who helped with biology ideas,
problems, and projects; Rebekah Levine, who assisted with environmental science ideas, problems,
and projects; and Debbie Seacrest, who advised on mathematical content and edited the entire book.
This work was partially supported by a grant from TRAILS Montana. Thanks to Christina Trunnell
for helping with many aspects of this book directly, as well as supporting OER projects all over
Montana.

ALGEBRA TIPS AND TRICKS PART I (COMBINING TERMS,
            DISTRIBUTING, FUNCTIONS, GRAPHING)

H ere are a few algebra tips and tricks to get you started. In later chapters, we will have some
          "just-in-time" algebra review, so you'll review an algebra concept just before you need it.

                                                                  COMBINING LIKE TERMS

A term is one or more things multiplied together: for example, is a term since it is times times
 , is a term, since it is times and is a term. If there is also a number multiplied in front of a

term, that is called the coefficient (if no coefficient is present, the coefficient is ). Two terms are like
terms if they have the same variables multiplied (but may have different coefficients). If two like terms
are added together, they can be combined into one term by adding the coefficients.

Problem Combine like terms:  .

                                                                          DISTRIBUTING

If you are multiplying by a sum in parentheses, the rule is to distribute
   Here is another version in "table" form.

   It works, check it out:
8                          TYLER SEACREST

   Here is an example:

   Problem Distribute and combine like terms:  .

                                                                               FOILING

When multiplying two sums, every term of the first must be multiplied by every term of the second.
Thus, if there are two terms in the first sum and two in the second, there are four total terms in the
product: the (f)irst two terms, the (o)utside terms, the (i)nside terms, and the (l)ast two terms. We can
use the acronym "foil":

   Here is the same calculation in table form:

   Here is an example:

   Problem Foil:        .

                                                         DISTRIBUTING WITH THREE TERMS

When you have three expressions multiplied together, things get a bit trickier. Let's do some examples.
                                       INFORMAL CALCULUS                                   9

Problem Find                       .

To do this, we first multiply the      . This is                                 . We then

multiply                          . This is done by combining every term in the first product with every

term in the last product. One way to do this is times everything in              , plus times

everything in  .

There you go.
Alternatively, we can use the table method. We start by foiling two of the terms together

Adding the blue terms, we get an intermediate answer of   . Now we can multiply this by
     .

Combining like terms gives the answer             , the same answer we got before!
                                       . We then can do
Problem Find   .

We see this is the same thing as

I won't do it this time, but you could use the table method if you prefer that!

                                        FUNCTIONS

A function is anything that produces an output for every possible input. So for example,          is
                                                                                             , etc.).
the function that take in an input , and outputs double (i.e.          ,             ,

Here are some examples:

Problem If       , find              and .

We see that              , and                 .

Problem If                   , find , , and                    .

In each case, just replace the with the input to the function. For example,

, and                                .

A tricky one is  . Here, we replace the with                        in the formula.

Tip: Always do substitutions or replacements like this in parentheses to keep it all together.

Here is what it would look like:

Problem If                   , find         .

We have to replace the with             in the formula. So we have

Problem If                   and               , what is            ?

Here, the idea is to replace with       in the formula. In other words, becomes           :
INFORMAL CALCULUS                                                                       11

GRAPHING FUNCTIONS

Graphing is a great way to visualize a function. For example, consider the graph of  .

   Choose any point on the curve. If you go down to the -axis, you'll get the input value, and if you
go directly left (or right) to the -axis, you'll get the output value. For example,
12                                      TYLER SEACREST

                                                   output

                                                              input

This reflects the fact that             .

Note: Anything with multiple outputs for one input is considered not a function. A handy way to

determine this is the "vertical line test" -- any vertical line should hit a function only once.

               Function                                       Not

                             hits once                     hits more
                                                           than once

                                                            TABLE METHOD FOR GRAPHING

If you want to graph a function by hand, a way that works for virtually any function is the table
method. Say we want to do the following:

Problem Graph                using the table method.

We can just start by plugging in some values like       ,  ,  , etc., and fill out a whole

table. For example, for      , we can compute                                                     . Since

    , we know that the point                       lies on the graph. Filling out the rest of the

table, we get
                                 INFORMAL CALCULUS          13

We can then plot these input-output pairs on the graph, and they trace out a curve. (Note that the

pair  didn't fit on the graph.)

    a boat load of cash, launders it, and makes bank. However, the Feds in the 2000s came out

    with these new benjamins with watermarks and stuff like that, and she can't counterfeit it

    anymore. She loses all her money gambling on water polo. She tries to get her business back

P urpose of the project: get familiar with the idea of creating a velocity function based on
        position data

Above are frames from a video of a simple ball toss. Every other frame from the 30 frames per

second video is shown, so the time between the frames is approximately  of a second.

1. Fill in the position data for each time in the table below. Velocity is usually defined as
    . How could you calculate velocities for each data point? Fill these in as well.

    Time (s) Position (cm) Velocity (cm/s)

    2. Create two graphs, either by hand or with graphing software: position versus time, and
        velocity versus time. In each case, time is the -axis, while the -axis is position in the first
        graph and velocity in the second graph. How are the two graphs related?

        Going from a position graph to a velocity graph like this is called a derivative, which we'll talk
        a lot more about in upcoming chapters.
    3. While your velocity graph is probably not a perfect line, imagine that it is linear for a second.
        What is the slope of the velocity graph? This is the rate of acceleration due to gravity, an
        important quantity in physics.
                        CHAPTER 4
             POSITION TO VELOCITY

T he idea of position of an object versus the velocity of an object encompasses all the big ideas of
        calculus. So that's where we'll start!
                                                                     HEADING TO A LAKE

Problem Suppose you're given a graph of your distance from home during a trip to the lake. It
might look something like this:

             POSITION GRAPH

Distance  2

from

home

(miles)

             0.5  1  1.5
                  Time (hours)

This graph might represent you walking to a lake two miles away, hanging out for half an hour,
then walking home. The first part of the graph that slants upwards represents your walk to
the lake, since your distance from home is increasing (higher on the graph). The second part
of the graph represents you hanging out at the lake. It's flat since your distance from home is
not changing. Finally, the part of the graph that slants down represents you walking home. Your
distance to home is decreasing, so the line goes down on the graph.

   Now here is the question: what is your velocity during this journey?

Velocity is a measure of speed, and essentially boils down to this equation:

   While you're walking to the lake, you're traveling at a rate of 2 miles every half hour (your change
in distance is two, during the half hour change in time). Therefore your velocity is . We can simplify
this fraction by multiplying top and bottom by , and we see
24                    TYLER SEACREST

   So you were walking at 4 miles per hour to the lake. This velocity doesn't change as you walk
to the lake, and so we call this a constant velocity. Graphically, we represent constant velocity with a
horizontal line:

                      VELOCITY GRAPH

                   4  0.5  1          1.5
    Velocity
    (miles per
    hour)

                                               Time (hours)

While at the lake, your position is not really changing 'cause you're just hanging out. So your velocity
is zero. To relate this back to the formula, your change of distance is zero while your change in time
is . So by the formula we have

   but we didn't really need to do the formula since we knew we weren't going anywhere. Graphically,
a velocity of zero looks like this:

                      VELOCITY GRAPH

                   4  0.5  1          1.5
    Velocity
    (miles per
    hour)

                            -4
                                               Time (hours)

Finally, while coming back home, again we have a change in distance of miles over a half an hour.
So you might think the velocity is again, but it is actually very natural to call this a negative velocity,
since the distance is going down. So we say that the change in distance is actually , and therefore:

Graphically:

                                               Time (hours)

Okay, now let's look at the position and velocity graphs together. I'll color each segment to emphasize
how the different parts correspond.

Another way to think of velocity is that it is the same as the slope of a line. Recall that the slope of a
line is a measure of how steep the line is, and the formula follows the phrase "rise over run". Let's look
again at the position and velocity graphs from the last subsection:
26                    TYLER SEACREST

                      POSITION GRAPH

                                               Time (hours)

   What is the slope of the red line? Well, rise over run would be , which is . That's the same as the
velocity graph! Same thing for the green line: it has a slope of zero, and the velocity graph is at zero.
Finally, the slope of the blue line is which is , and that is what we have for the velocity graph.

   So "slope" and "velocity" are the same thing. But there is another name for this concept that we will
use a lot: derivative. Derivative, slope, and velocity all mean the same thing.

                                                         OTHER EXAMPLES OF DERIVATIVES

Let's see some other examples. Note for each of these, the position graphs is always piecewise linear, or
made up of line segments. This makes it easier to find the velocity, or slope.

   Example Position to Velocity

      Problem Find the velocity graph (i.e. the derivative) corresponding to the following position
      graph.

                                                 40
                                                 20

                                                             5 10 15
                                                               seconds

To solve this problem, we need to find the velocity, or slope, of each of the lines in the graph.

The first line has a change of distance of , and a change of time of seconds, so the velocity is

. Next, the we have a negative change of distance of                       since the graph goes from

to . This also occurs over seconds, so the velocity is                     . Finally, we gain a distance

of in the final line over five seconds, so the velocity is              .

We can also go in the reverse direction: take a velocity graph, and create a position graph. This is called
integration or taking an integral. This can be tricky but we can do it at this point if the function is what
is called a step function, which is basically a function consisting of a bunch of flat parts.

   Example Integration

      Problem Given the following velocity graph, create a position graph.

                      VELOCITY GRAPH

                  -5

                 -10

Given these velocities, we want to graph where the person travels, and the person can start
wherever we want. For convenience we will start the person at location zero. If we focus on the
first section, we see the person is traveling at 5 miles per hour for three hours. This corresponds
to the person traveling miles total during the first three hours. It would look something like
this:

                      POSITION GRAPH

for hours: this would be a total of

To find out the position, note that we use multiplication. For example, in the first 3 hours, they

move at 4 miles per hour, so we multiply:                  miles. In the next hour stretch, we're

at mph, so we multiply                     . The last bit is two hours long at 12 mph, so we

multiply  . Note that we ALSO multiply when we find area, so we can think of these

calculations (velocity to position) as area calculations:

                               12

          velocity             4 area 12                   area 24

The following graphs are not made up of straight lines -- but we can still tell if the derivative is
positive or negative. A positive derivative means a quantity is increasing -- and graphically that is
represented by a graph the climbs as you go from left to right. A negative derivative means a quantity is
getting smaller -- graphically going downward from left to right.

That's the graph of ! It is called a piecewise defined function. Since each piece is linear, sometimes

it is called a piecewise linear function.

There is one more detail to clear up. What is the value of the function at  ?

Well, going back to the original function, we see that     was defined as      for  , and this

includes  . So we should use the blue line to determine the y-coordinate for        . To indicate

this on the graph, a filled in dot can be added to the blue graph (indicating the endpoint is included),

and an open or not-filled-in dot is added to the green graph (to indicate the endpoint is not included).

                LIMITS

I n Section 1A, we saw how to go from a position graph to a velocity graph. However, the graphs we
    were dealing with were piecewise linear, which made it very easy to find the velocities, or the
    slopes. If the position graphs are not piecewise linear, it is more difficult to find the slope at a given
point on the graph.

   There is a very nice way of doing this for many functions, but if we're not careful, it will require
division by zero! What does being careful entail? It means knowing your limits!

               NUMERICAL LIMITS

Suppose you wanted to evaluate the function       at  . Plugging in  into the

formula gives

But there is a problem -- we've divided by zero.

                                                     (image credit: Jaggery)
   Hopefully you didn't actually do the division by zero. What can we do instead? Let's make a table to
see what happens when we get close to putting in two, without actually doing it.

If you look at the table, it looks like  SHOULD be equal to at             . We can't plug in

because of division by zero, but it really should be if it has a value. Can we just say it's 12 and call

it a day? Well, not quite, since we want to distinguish between functions that are actually equal to 12,

and ones that just should be. That's where limits come in.

   We say       is undefined, but we can write              , which we read as "the limit of of

   as approaches two is twelve". That example is the idea behind a limit.

   More technically, a limit is a value the -value of a function           approaches as the -value

approaches a certain value , either from the right, the left or both. Notationally,

is the left hand limit,                  is the right hand limit, and                is the two-

sided limit. Let's look at some pictures to make this more intuitive.

                                         GRAPHICAL LIMITS

Consider the following   .

                                y-axis

                         12

                          4

                                     1 2 3 x-axis

To find the value of a function, recall that you look at how high that function is at a given value. For

example,        is about , and  is about .

                                10
                                 8

                                 4

                                            1 2 3 x-axis

What's happening at             , or  ? The filled-in circle shows the function value. The white circle

indicates that value is not part of the function. So             .

                                      y-axis

                                12
                                 8
                                 4

                                            1 2 3 x-axis

However, there is something funny going on at            . Namely, the function seems to "jump from ,

stop at momentarily, then finally jump to and continue. This is called a discontinuity, and is usually

a bad thing, or at least something that can be hard to deal with. This is where limits can be helpful.

The notation                    indicates the -value of the function as approaches the value of from

the left. Here is the picture:

                                      y-axis

                                12
                                 8
                                 4

                                            1 2 3 x-axis

In other words,                       is the value that  should be at , if you were approaching
from the left. In this case,
                                      should be 4 if everything were right in the world. Therefore,
44                                  TYLER SEACREST

           . The limit allows us to fill in what the function should be, even though it isn't the

case.

The right handed limit              is the same way, but it approaches from the right.

                            y-axis

                        12
                         8
                         4

                                    1 2 3 x-axis

Here, the function approaches as we approach     from the right, and therefore we write
                     .
                                                        . In other words, if the left and right
   A two-sided limit exists if                  . Since the left and right limits are different,
limits are the same. The notation for this is
so we just write "Does Not Exist" or "DNE". So                    .

1. We are looking at the function at                   . The actual value here is                    . However,

    the value it should be if we were coming at from the left is , so

                                   . Coming from the right, it should be , so                              .

    Finally,                              , since the left and right limits are not equal.

2. We are looking at the function at                   . We have               , since that's where the

    black dot is. But the value SHOULD be , whether we approach from the right or left. So

                                                       . Since the left and right limits are equal, we have

                             .

3. We have                      ,                           ,                      , and

                                   .

4. Everything is nice and happy -- there are no discontinuities here. Therefore

                                                                        .

5. We have what is called a vertical asymptote, and the function basically goes off infinitely far

    in both directions. Here, we say                           , since there is no obvious value to make

    equal to. We say                          , since it goes up infinitely high (the symbol means

    "infinity"). Likewise,                                     , since it goes down infinitely low. Therefore,

    we can see                     does not exist.

6. We have                ,                         ,                   , and

    .

7. We have                . What we are asking here is what happens to             as gets really big. In

    other words, what happens to the function as goes to infinity? Well, it looks like perhaps

           is just heading towards zero. So we say                      . There is no such thing as a

    right hand or two-sided limit in this case, nor does it make sense to talk about                    . So we

    just leave it as                      . This is the same thing as a horizontal asymptote.

8. Similarly we are looking at what happens to                    when goes more and more negative. It

    looks like maybe               is heading towards , so we write                          .

pencil at some point, that point is called a discontinuity. If the whole function is continuous

everywhere, then the function itself is called continuous.

and         , this works for both                    and      . Thus,

Let's do a couple more examples.

 Problem Factor                     .

In this case we want                            and       .        and                 works, so

This is a bit harder because the numbers are bigger, but we can still do it. We want

hence             , which means                 . That means  , so            (or vice versa).

                    ALGEBRAIC LIMITS

A lot of times you don't need to look at a graph or make a table to find a limit. Consider the
         following:
Problem Find  .

For this problem, we could make a table, or look at a graph, but        is such a nice function that
there really isn't any point in doing all that. Everything is happy at  , so we can just plug in that
value.

   In fact, any polynomial, logarithmic, or exponential function that you might run into is what is
called continuous. Continuous means that the limit is what you get if you just plug the value into the
function. So why bother with limits? Well, there are some functions that are not continuous, such as
rational functions. And rational functions are exactly what crop up when taking derivatives. Consider
this example:

Problem Find     .

Look at what happens when you plug in  .

   This is the same problem we saw in the numerical limits section. The fraction  is called the
indeterminate case. Here is where a graph or a table might be useful.

Looks like the limit should be equal to .
   But there is algebraic way. Just remember this: factor the top, and cancel like terms. Let's see it in

action.

   Notice though that it's not right to say                  always, since they are not equal when

        . At     ,  is not defined, and      is. However, if you're inside a limit as         ,

then is not equal to , it is just approaching . Hence it is okay to cancel those terms.

   When dealing with rational expressions, sometimes you can't cancel terms but can still find the

value of the limit. For example,

   Problem Find                   ,

The numerator does not factor. So there isn't anything we can cancel. But if we just plug in  ,

we see
                 INFORMAL CALCULUS                           57

   In this example, the top is approaching , and the bottom . Since there is no division by zero
here, the limit value is just . Easy peasy!

   If you plug in a value to take a limit and you get a nonzero number divided by zero, you can just say
the limit does not exist. For example,

   Problem

we see

   Here, the denominator is approaching zero, while the numerator is holding steady at . The result
of this is dividing by smaller and smaller numbers, which means the value is getting bigger and bigger
to infinity. Thus, the limit does not exist. Check out the table for this problem.

                               Simplified

As you can see,  is really large when is close to . In short: is the indeterminate case where

factoring and cancelling is a good idea. Anything else divided by zero is easy to determine: does not

exist.

                         INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY

W hat can we say about velocity if the position graph is a curve?
Problem For example, if                , we'd get a graph that looks like this.

                                       POSITION

                                           seconds

                         ? Seriously, what is it? I want to know.

Well, a first stab might be that it is the slope, since that is what we said before. But generally slope is
only applied to lines, not curves like this. How could we find slope for a curve?

   Well, recall that slope is just how steeply something is increasing. It turns out, we can take a line that
is increasing with the same steepness as the curve at a given point, and measure the slope of the line.

                                       POSITION

                                       5 10 15

Here, the red line is the same steepness as the curve at  . This is called a tangent line. Note that

often the tangent line only touches the curve once. Since it is a line, we can measure the slope, and

this should represent the velocity at  . But since it touches one time, we don't have two points

to compute the slope. This may seem like a minor problem, but to find the exact slope takes one of
62                                 TYLER SEACREST

the major insights in calculus: we need to develop a process to get closer and closer, and then use a
limit to find the exact value. This might seem like a lot of work but it is worth it, as it demonstrates
the power of calculus.

   Let's zoom in a bit on the graph:

                                   5

Okay, now we can start to see some things. First, notice we know the -value or function value at the

point   . Why? Since the function     is giving the position, we can plug in  .

We see      .

        50

                                           5

But this doesn't give us the slope. To find a slope, you need two points -- then you can use the rise over
run formula. But we only have one point. So instead let's look at a line that does have two intersection
points, but is not quite the line we want.

                                   5               6

Now we can find the slope of the green line. It's                , since that is what rise over run tells

us. But again, it isn't quite the line we want. Instead, we could choose a blue line that's even closer.

   50

                                                 5 5.5 6

Now the slope of the blue line is                  . Still not there. But we can get closer and

closer and closer. Instead of repeating this calculation every time, let us use variables. So instead of
64                                           TYLER SEACREST         , or to the right of where the

red line crosses.

                                            h

What is the blue question mark? Well, we just plug

There you go.

                         50

                                             5 5+h
                                                h

Now the slope is rise over run, and we have
                              INFORMAL CALCULUS                                                    65

Okay, what we are really interested in is when gets really, really small. That's when the blue line

slope will equal the red line slope, and the red line slope is what we want. But we can't plug in  ,

since that would give a division by zero explosion. So instead, we can use a limit!

And there you have it. The slope of the red line is !

Now, suppose instead of       , we were interested in the instantaneous velocity at                . And

suppose instead of            , we had some other function describing position, which we call .

What would the picture look like then? Well, it would look very similar to the last picture.

                    f(x + h)                           f(x)
                    f(x)

                                              x x+h
                                               h

And this is the picture that gives us the definition of the derivative. What is the blue slope? It's

   So how do we find the red slope? We just take the limit as the blue line approaches the red -- that
is, see what happens as goes to zero.

   The reason is when we multiply fractions, we multiply straight across, and we can always think of

as . Hence  .

                                                                    COMPLEX FRACTIONS

If you have "fractions within fractions", this calls out to be simplified. One way to do it is to multiply
top and bottom of the outer fraction by the same number so that the inner fractions go away. For
example,

   Problem

If we multiply top and bottom by  in the following example, that gets rid of the  and the
denominators:

You can also multiply by the reciprocal instead of dividing. Like this:

   The same thing happens with variables. Consider this problem:
   Problem

We can simplify this by multiplying by to get rid of the and denominators on top.

Here's one more example.

I n the last section, we saw the instantaneous rate of change, or derivative, of a function  at a

point is given by

Problem Find the derivative of the function       using the definition of the
derivative.

To use this in the formula                    , first we need to replace the                 part of

the formula. This is the same as    which is      , except we replace with that

in parantheses. Like the following. The colors are only to highlight the substitution of

Now we continue to simplify and find the answer.

        PROJECT: HARD DEFINITION OF DERIVATIVE PROBLEMS

P urpose of the project: Struggle through a difficult but important calculus problem.
           Each of the following is a difficult definition of the derivative problem. Your group will be
        assigned one of the following, and then you can present the solution to the class. In each case,
the "stuff in the example box" is not your problem, but look at it and hopefully it will help with your
problem.

Example Simplify  .We can do this problem by splitting it up into

                  . We know                             -- that means

   To solve from here, we need to multiply every term of               by , then every
term by , then every term by , and add it all up. Here we go:

2. Let             . Using the definition of the derivative, find     (which can also be written
        or ).

Example Rationalize the numerator of  .

To "rationalize the numerator", the trick is to multiply top and bottom by what is known

as the conjugate: it is the same as the numerator, only the sign is flipped so that

subtraction becomes addition or vice versa. In this case, the conjugate is  .

We see
78                TYLER SEACREST

    The numerator is now rationalized.

    3. Let        . Using the definition of the derivative, find  (which can also be
        written
                 or ). There are three facts we need to compute this derivative:

                         PROJECT: KILLDEER MIGRATION SPEED

P urpose: To calculate a derivative with messy and incomplete data.

   (image credit: Becky Matsubara)
   Killdeer are small birds famous for their loud, squeaky call and defense behavior that includes
feigning wing injuries. Their population is also mysteriously declining, so getting a handle on their
numbers and migratory patterns is important. They are partially migratory, with some going from the
southern US and Mexico up to the northern US and Canada, while some stay put. The main question
here is to use messy data to get some sort of idea of how fast they are moving at any given time.

      1. To simplify things, suppose there are just three migrating killdeer birds, and they don't
           migrate together necessarily. These three birds were seen at various positions along a
88  TYLER SEACREST

    migration route. Note that each data point is only one of the three birds, and you don't
    know which one.

           The goal is to fill out a new table with the velocity or derivative of the killdeer at any given
        time. Since you don't really know which killdeer is which, this velocity will represent some
        sort of average or aggregate velocity for the three killdeer.

           What are some different ways you can do this? Talk about it as a group, and then work
        towards filling in the second table. Do the birds seem to be getting faster as time passes, or
        slower?
    2. Same type of question with a new setup. The goal is to figure out a rough speed of migration
        (just one number this time). There are three areas: Mexico, Oklahoma, and Montana, and
        you have rough esimates for the abundance in each of the three areas during both the non-
        breeding and breeding seasons. For simplicity, assume all the killdeer stay within these three
        areas (even though that is clearly false). How can you figure some sort of average velocity of
        the killdeer in this case?

      3. Look at the excel spreadsheet entitled "Killdeer abundance data", with data taken from the
           eBird data repository.

           Click here for a cool visualization of this data.
              Use the data in the spreadsheet to create a best guess average velocity during the time

           period starting with the non-breeding season and ending with the breeding season (roughly
           January through June). The final answer is just that one number, but there is a lot of data to
           sort through to get there!

W hen simplifying exponents, remember the exponentiation is just repeated multiplications. So
            if you have something like
   This is three s multiplied by seven s, so that's ten s all multiplied together.
   Similarly, all these other rules don't even have to be memorized if you just think about how repeated
multiplication would work. But here they are anyway.

Some examples:

 Problem .

Here we have eleven s, and we are taking away via division five of them then four of

them. Hence we have two s left over:  . Note that is a fundamental constant in
mathematics, like , equal to                 approximately, but we just use for
the exact value.

same thing as taking a square root, cube root, 4th root, etc, depending on what the denominator is.

"I' ve got the power!" -Snap (German band)
                If you apply the definition of the derivative to several functions, you'll see:

   See the pattern?

   As we'll see in the next section, this even works for non-integers. The key is to multiply by the
exponent, then decrease the exponent by one.

   The next rules say that constant multiples and addition work nicely.

   The key is you can just worry about the derivative of each piece of a sum separately. Constant
multiples "come along for the ride". With only these three rules, you can now take the derivative of
any polynomial. Check it out.

    constant, so it does not affect the slope. Hence we get   .

Note that the power rule works with fractional and negative exponents as well! Here are some
examples.

                                       LOGARITHMS

A logarithm is the inverse function to an exponential function. For example, for the exponential
function             , if we have an input of    , we get an output of     , and we write

           . The logarithmic function            is the reverse of this. We swap the input and

the output, so now   and  . We see                 .

In calculus, we will mostly use the exponential function and its inverse,  . Below are some

important formulas:

Examples:

Problem              .

There are two ways to do this one. First, we can bring down the exponent of two down in front

           . Then can combine the like terms of       and              :

Alternatively, we can rewrite the subtraction as a division, like so:

Find the following derivatives.

     1. Problem

     We just need to take the derivative of each term. The stays the same when you take the

     derivative, so we just leave that piece. The  , as we saw above, has derivative . Hence

     2. Problem

      We can use the power rule on -- multiply by the two, and subtract one from the two,
      to get . We then see that is , and the stays along for the ride. So

     3. Problem

     Remember that to take the derivative of , we rewrite as and use the power rule, and

     we have     . For  , the        becomes , and the four multiplies. Therefore we
     have

   But wait -- these fraction actually can be added together. First, change the  back
into . Then we'll get a common denominator, and simplify.

                 Hence we have

Two more quick formulas.

   We'll prove the first rule once we have the chain rule up and running. For the second rule, the proof
only requires the base change formula.

   Example Log in base proof
      Problem Prove the following rule
             

   We use the base change formula, which states
      From this we see
106                                    TYLER SEACREST

   Now this proof demonstrates a tricky thing in calculus: sometimes we can just "bring things
out" of the derivative like we did with , and other times we cannot. The reason we could take

the  out is that it is considered a constant. The derivative is only measuring the change as

changes, not as changes. So  is a constant, or unchanging value as      changes. Therefore, by

the constant multiple rule, we can just take it out of the derivative.

Now to use the new rules.
   Example Base examples
   Compute the following derivatives.

     1. Problem

      We use the formula on and see the derivative is                         . Same goes for
                                 . So the end result is                 .

     2. Problem

     We use the formula to get                         , and multiply the answer by and get
                  .

more. Cosine, denoted

radians. You can also use and with degree angle measurements, but for calculus, it works

much better in radians. Make sure your calculator is in radian mode for this class. Notice also that

the outputs for  and  with  are the same as with      . That's not a coincidence

                                PRODUCT RULE

O kay, but what about           ? Can we just take the derivative of each like this?

Unfortunately, no. Just to be clear: the above calculation is false!

Think about  . We know          , so therefore you might think

But we also know that           . So what do we make of this? Well, we just have to

give up on the idea of "taking the derivative of each" with products. Luckily, there is a rule called the

product rule that works great:

   The motto for this rule is "the first times the derivative of the second, plus the second times the
derivative of the first."

   Where does this rule come from? Well, consider this picture:
112                                       TYLER SEACREST

Here we have a rectangle. The height is , the width is . The area of the rectangle is . If we were

to make bigger by a little bit, by say , and bigger by , then the rectangle would become

bigger too. We want to find out how quickly the area is increasing. So how quickly is it increasing? You

can see in the picture we add three sections on:     ,        , and     . If you think of and

     as being really small, though, the           terms is incredibly tiny -- so tiny it does not affect

the answer in the limit. Therefore, the new area is                  . This is where the product rule

comes from -- it's how an area changes as you change each side length.

Let's see this rule in action.
   Example

In this case, we can attack this using the product rule with  , and              . We can easily take

the derivative of each part:       , and             . Hence, using the formula

We see                and                             . Hence, we have

W hat about      ? Can we just take the derivative of the top and bottom separately, and put

them together? Nope, we need a quotient rule.

   Where did this strange formula come from? Some fancy algebra will get you there as the next
example shows.

Problem Prove the quotient rule                    .

Note that I'm using and instead of and right now because we will need and to mean

something else in just a second.

So what can we do? One way it to use the product rule in a strange manner. We are going to

apply it to      . We set         , and  . We see

But notice that                          . Hence, we have

Now we just have to solve for , and we have a formula for derivatives of quotients!

     If we turn this equation around, it gives the same quotient rule I mentioned earlier:

     This has a cute rhyme to it: "low dee high minus high dee low, over the square of what's below".

The "low dee high" means , since is the "low" and is the "dee high". Then "minus high dee

low" is  . Finally, "over the square of what's below" is .

                                      CHAIN RULE

W ith one additional rule, we will have the power to take the derivative of any function we can
            write down. What is this amazing rule? Why, it's called the chain rule. The chain rule is
                                                       . If we drop the  on each function (note that it is still
there, it is just implied), we have a slightly shorter version:

Here,        is called function composition. It does not mean times . It means we are sticking

inside of ! Like is eating ! That's actually cannibalism if you think about it -- so don't think about

it too closely. But do remember how to do function composition.

Why does this work? I'm not going to do a formal proof, but let's run through an idea behind it.

Recall that the derivative is the slope or how steep the graph of a function is. This is a lot easier to

think about if we're talking about lines. For example, suppose           , and  . As we

know from algebra, the slope of the line is , and the slope of the line is .

So what is the slope of  ? What this means is we are putting inside of . So if

, and        , we take the blue       and use that to replace the red . Here is what is would
look like:

So again, what is the slope of   ? We can see from this calculation that it is , the product of the

two slopes and . That's why you have  in the formula.

Okay, but what about the after the in the formula? One way to think about the function

composition  is we are looking at the curve at the -location of . When you take the

derivative, you're still looking at that same location (now on the       curve), so you still need that
there to specify that location.
124                                    TYLER SEACREST

Example Chain rule with

     Problem Find                   .

We must identify an "inside" (g) and "outside" (f) function in order to use the chain rule. Often,
the "inside" function will be in parentheses (though not always). That works in this case, so the

"inside" function is          , so     . The outside function is , and hence                .

We also know             and           . Now to use the chain rule, we first need   . What is

this? Well, remember that this is not multiplication, but it is sticking one function inside another.

In this case, we are taking            and sticking it into the function         . This means we

replace the in , replacing it with     , and get                   . Hence we have

     There you have it!

Example Chain rule with       in two different ways: using power rule, and using the chain

   rule.

Using              the        power              rule,         we         first     multiply

                                                                          . In this form, it is

easy to find the derivative:                                .      , and the outside function as
   Using the chain rule, we identify the inside  function as
   . We then have

Again, math just works!

Things can get quite complicated with the chain rule.
   Example Complicated chain rule

Problem Find                 .

There are no explicit parentheses here, but the square root acts like parentheses, and it designates

an inside function of               . The outside function is therefore  . If we rewrite

as , we can use the power rule and find                  . We also have       .

Hence, the chain rule gives

That's as simplified as we can get the answer to be.

O kay, let's talk about                . If you're thinking this looks like a product rule, but it

        also looks like a chain rule, you're right. To compute this derivative, we need to do the chain

        rule and the product rule. This is because it is a multirule problem. Let's do this example

So, suppose I ask the question "what is the anti-derivative of ?" There are many possible

solutions, including ,        ,        , etc. However, all of these solutions are basically the same

thing. To get around this problem, we say often use the notation  . Here, is called the constant

of integration. In this form, the antiderivative is called an indefinite integral.

If we are dealing with a polynomial, we know the derivative follows the power rule. With anti-

derivatives, it follows the inverse power rule:

Note that this only works if           . Can you see what goes wrong in the formula if      ?

We also have the rules of linearity work in reverse. So when taking anti-derivatives, you can just

look at one term at a time, and the constant will stay during the anti-derivative process.

Here are some examples.
Example Antiderivative Examples

      Problem Find              .

     Using the inverse power rule, we have                        .

      Problem Find                 .

     The constant will "come along for the ride", or not be affected by the anti-derivative
     process. Hence we see

Note that the in the part of the answer is not really necessary. What is important

is we are indicating that you can add any constant of integration we'd like. Therefore, we

will often replace the  , and we have the answer

   In fact, often we will just wait to add the until the end. In that case, we would arrive
at an answer of , then we'd add the at that stage, and get an answer of

   Notice we didn't add the constant of integration until the last step, and that's perfectly
okay.

In a sum, we can just treat each term separately. And the constants come along for the

                                  DERIVATIVES AND GRAPHS

A s we've seen, one of the most important connections between a function and its derivative is
         that a positive derivative means the quantity is increasing, and a negative derivative means the quantity
         is decreasing.
   Example Increasing and Decreasing

              Problem Outside temperature has a positive derivative from 3am to 3pm, and a
                 negative derivative from 3pm to 3am. Draw a graph of this, and label each part of
                 the graph as "increasing" or "decreasing".

              With the positive derivative from 3am to 3pm, this should go up and be labeled
              "increasing". From 3pm to 3am, the graph is going down and labeled "decreasing".

              Increasing              ing

midnight 3am              3pm              3am

At the interface between increasing and decreasing, at 3pm, is when the temperature is the highest.
142  TYLER SEACREST

This is the key to one of the most useful applications of calculus: optimization! Optimization is either
finding out when a quantity is maximized, or as high as possible, or finding out when a quantity is
minimized, or as low as possible. Often this is at the interface of increasing and decreasing, and thus
at the where a function goes from positive derivative to negative derivative. Hence, one of the most
important maxims of calculus: optimization happens when the derivative is zero! We will come back to this
in a future section.

   For now, using this idea of when the derivative is positive, negative, or zero, we can draw a rough
sketch of the derivative based on the graph of a function. Let's see an example

   Example Derivative sketching

      Problem Sketch the derivative of the following function.

When sketching the derivative, keep this idea in mind: slopes become -values. First, let's mark
where the derivative is zero:

                                               negative
     positive
                                              positive
                                     INFORMAL CALCULUS                                       143

These are the places that, in the derivative graph, have zero for the -value. That means these are
the -intercepts!

   Now let's mark where the derivative is positive, and where it is negative.

positive                             negative
                                         positive

Finally, we can use this as a rough guide for a sketch, again keeping in mind slope becomes
-values. Here, the derivative is in black, while the original function is in grey.

                                               negative
positive
                                         positive

Let's see another example.
   Example Derivative Sketching 2
      Problem Sketch the derivative
144  TYLER SEACREST

In this case, the graph is always going down, so the derivative is always negative. That doesn't
really tell you a lot about what the derivative graph looks like. However, there is a special point
called an inflection point right here:

                                                                 inflection point

It's not where the slope is zero, but it is where the slope gets the closest to zero. Everywhere else
the slope is more negative than at the inflection point. So in the derivative graph this becomes a
maximum or highest point, like this:
INFORMAL CALCULUS  145

                                                                 inflection point

As long as that inflection point is the highest point (but still a negative -value due to the negative
slope of the original graph), that's about the best you can do on that one.

SECOND DERIVATIVES AND INTERPRETING THE DERIVATIVE

W e understand velocity versus position at this point, but what about the derivative of other
            changing quantities? What does it mean? Let's look at an example.
   Example Glacial Loss

Problem Let     be the mass in metric tonnes of a glacier over a given time , where is

measured in years. What do you think the graph of  looks like? Given global warming,

it's probably going down, like this:

              M(t)

             (metric tonnes)

                                                   time (years)

Question: What is the derivative measuring now? What would the graph of the derivative
look like?

Answers: Good questions! Just like the derivative of position is velocity, or how fast the position

is changing, the derivative of            is going to be how fast the mass of the glacier is changing. In

this case, it is how fast it is melting.

We can automatically assign units to the derivative. Since the original graph is metric tonnes

on the -axis, and years on the -axis, we know the unit of the derivative (unless we want to

convert) is going to be metric tonnes per year. We might then talk about the derivative being

             .
156                                   TYLER SEACREST

   Notice I assumed the derivative was negative. Why did I do that? That is because the graph is
going down, and the glacier is losing mass.

   Note further that it isn't just going down like a line going down. It's a curve downward. What
does this mean for the derivative? Well, the derivative starts negative since it's going down, and
continues to be negative as it goes down. But it goes down faster and faster as you move to the
right -- that means the derivative is getting more and more negative. Like this:

                                                      time (years)

                  )   M'(t)
                     ) metric tonnes

                           year

So we can see that this derivative is negative, but it's worse than that -- it's negative and going
down. That's not good news for the glacier. Looking at whether the derivative is going up or
down is known as the second derivative. We will see in the next section this is easy to calculate.

As we saw in the above example, sometimes we need to repeat the process of taking derivatives. This
gives the second derivative, third derivative, and so on. The notation is

   You can also take three, four, or more derivatives. Instead of writing several primes, we write
for the fourth derivative, for the fifth derivative, and so on. Let's do a couple of examples.

For (3), we take the derivative of  . This is .

S ometimes we have a function and we just really want to know what its high point or low point
        is in terms of -value. The high point is called a maximum, and the low point is called a
        minimum. For most functions, these points occur when the derivative is zero or undefined (we
talked about why this is briefly in a previous section).

Example Optimization

Problem The height of a baseball follows the function        , where

is measured in meters and is measured in seconds.. What value of maximizes the height?

We will follow the maxim "optimization happens when the derivative is zero". First we find the

derivative using the power rule  . Then we set this equal to zero, so we solve

   Hence, the height is maximized when the time is equal to  seconds. At this point, the height
of the ball is                                                            meters. Here's a rough
sketch based on what we know about this function:

plugging         into the original equation) is just  . Not too bad!

                                     DERIVATIVES IN SPACE

S o far when we have thought about applying derivatives, we've always thought in terms of time.
        So we've focused on rates like meters per second, degrees Celsius per second, liters per minute,
        and so on, everything per unit time. However, we don't always get derivatives with respect to
time.

   For example, consider this box:

And let's consider the temperature of the box at every point. We can show this using red to mean hot
and blue to mean cold:
Note that the temperature changes, but not in time. Instead, the temperature changes as you move
down the box -- that is, the temperature changes in space. We can show the same thing in the graph:
178                                            TYLER SEACREST

                                                  distance from the back (cm)

And just as before, the slope of this graph at any point is the derivative. What are the units? Well, they

would be .
   Let's continue with this example.

Example Temp in a box

              Problem Suppose the equation                                 described the temperature, in

              Celsius, of the box from the previous diagrams at a distance of centimeters from the back.

                        1. What is the derivative of the temperature halfway down the box?
                        2. What is the derivative of the temperature three-quarters of the way down the box?
                        3. Let's go back to thinking about time. According to the heat equation, a point in

                            space will tend to get hotter if the second derivative in space is positive, and colder
                            if the second derivative in space is negative. Based on this statement, is this box
                            going to get hotter or colder? What does that mean regarding its derivative in time?

              1. We can see from the previous graph that the box is centimeters long, so half way

                        would be  cm. We know                              . So if we just plug in

                        , we get

                                                   . Again, the units are  . So that means for every cm you
                                              C colder.
                        travel, the box gets

              2. Now we just plug in          into the derivative we already found                        , and
                          INFORMAL CALCULUS                                                  179

we see                    . This means, at this point in the box, the box is

getting colder faster. You can see this in the graph as well.

3. To answer this question, we need the second derivative      . This is just the derivative

of      , and so we just drop the and get                      . Since the second

derivative with respect to space is negative, the heat equation says the first derivative

with respect to time is also negative. So if we just leave this box alone, it would tend to

get colder. That is, the  is negative as well.

                      HOMEWORK: DERIVATIVES IN SPACE

1. We've talked a lot about how derivatives measure slope, but literal slope on a topographic
    map is a good example of derivatives in space. Consider this picture:

       src: usgs.gov's topoview
       The thinnest contours on the map represent a height gain of feet, and the slightly thicker
    contours are a height gain of feet. Each thick red line has a length of roughly feet.
    What is the slope of the mountain at the thick red lines?
2. Consider the following thermal image of wolves howling:
182  TYLER SEACREST

            src: usgs.gov
                a. Why is the eyes and mouth much hotter than other parts of the wolves, like the
                    neck?
                b. According to the heat equation, things get colder or warmer depending on the
                    second derivative with respect to space. Assuming these wolves are a constant
                    temperature, that means the second derivative of temperature with respect to space
                    is zero. What does it mean for the first derivative if the second derivative is zero?
                    What does that mean for the temperature of the wolves at different places on its
                    body where the fur is thinner or thicker?

     3. Consider a cylinder filled with particles of some important nutrient (say oxygen). Suppose
         the concentration isn't constant, but instead looks something like this:

         The oxygen particles will tend to move from areas of high concentration to areas of low
         concentration, a process called diffusion. Diffusion is extremely important in biology, since
         that is how many cells get their nutrients.

                a. Based on the diagram of the cylinder, draw a rough sketch of the concentration
                    graph. On the -axis should be concentration (molecules per cm ), and on the
                    -axis should be distance from the back of the cylinder measured in cm.

                b. Based on your graph, estimate the slope at two points of your choosing. The
                    notation for your answers would be .
INFORMAL CALCULUS  183

c. The rate at which the particles move in diffusion is called flux. It follows Fick's law:

   Here, flux is how fast the particles are moving, is the diffusion coefficient (a
constant), and is what we found in the previous part. Why is there a negative in
the equation? Explain it in words, and talk about your graph and your answers for
from the previous part.

             RECURRANCE RELATIONS

A s we'll see in the next section, a differential equation looks like this:          . What I

     want to first talk about though are recurrence relations. Let me introduce these with a magic

     trick.

Example Magic Trick
Pick a number between 1 and 100, and I'm going to guess it. But not before we mix it up a bit.

     1. Take your number and divide by five, and round to the nearest whole number.
     2. Then add to the result.
     3. Repeat steps (1) and (2) twice more, for a total of three iterations.

Done? I bet you ended with the number 45. Are you amazed?

This trick is based off the recurrence relation            . Think of as the previous value,

and  as the new value. How do you get from one to another? Well, ignoring the rounding, you

divide by and add , and that's exactly what                is telling you to do. In order to use

such a equation, we need an initial value or . In the trick, this was the original number you picked.

Let's create a graph with the initial value      :
188                                        TYLER SEACREST

As you can see, this recurrence relation quickly converges to  by the time     . That's why

the trick works! If we started somewhere else, the graph looks much the same and it converges to 45

anyway.

However, recurrence relations are useful for more than just magic tricks.

Example Logging

     Problem Let be the biomass of a forest in year . Suppose it expands by each year, but

     also loses       metric tonnes to logging. What might be a recurrence relation that explains

     this situation?

Well, since this is a recurrence relation, we want to relate the quantity under consideration, to
its value the next year, which is . So it will look something like

     but those aren't the right values yet -- just want to have some idea of where this is going.

     The first thing we need to encode is the expansion by . We can take , or  and multiply

by like so:           . But the old forest is still there (except for the logging, which we'll worry

about in a second), so let's add as well:  . If we factor out , we get
                   INFORMAL CALCULUS                                                        189

This is the growth by . What about that logging? Well, that's not a percent change, so we'll

just subtract the  to represent the loss of biomass. So our final recurrence relation is->

Problem What happens to the forest in the long run according to your recurrence relation?

Well, let's play with it a bit and see what happens. But before we can do that, we need an initial

value . Let's guess something. Since we are losing             a year, we'll need a much bigger

number than        . Let's just guess that is  metric tonnes.

Now we can compute several values:

We can see that the biomass is going down -- not a good sign for the forest. We can speed these

calculations up quite a bit in excel. If you do that, you can see that the forest will be totally gone

in by , in less than thirty years. However, that's not a full answer, since it may depend on how

much biomass we start with. Suppose it's a larger forest with       . Then we see

And the forest just grows from there.

Let's see an even more complicated example.

Example Life Cycle of Cutthroat Trout

Problem Recurrence relations can model the life of plant and animals species as they move

from one stage of life to the next. For example, let , , , , , be the amount of

cutthroat trout (oncorhynchus clarkii) in southwest Montana of age , , , , , and or

more respectively. Here, is a measured in years starting from some  . Then according

to https://compadre-db.org/Species/47501, these quantities follow the recurrence relation
190                                             TYLER SEACREST

     Explain what each number in these recurrence relations mean.

My goodness, that's a complicated mess of symbols. But with a little patience, we can figure it out

I think.

     Let's start with the line                  . We know from the problem statement that are the

trout of age 0 at year . The quantity           is the amount of one year old trout at year       . This

equation is relating the number of year olds with the number of year olds a year later. What

it is saying is     times the number of zero year olds gives you the number of one year olds a

year later. In other words, this equation is giving a           survival rate from age zero to age one.

From here, we can now easily decode several other equations.          gives a

survival rate from age one to age two. The similar we find            survival rate from age

two to age three, and the same rate from age three to age four. The equation

                                is a bit more complicated, since trout of age 5+ come from the

age 4 trout, but also the age 5+ stay within that category, so there are two ways to get there. Both

of these involve a              survival rate.

Notice these survival rates are pretty low by human standards. However, there is some good news

for the species: look at the first equation                           . What do you

make of this? That's right -- these are the new baby trout! As you can see, there are a lot of new

babies that help balance the low survival rates we noticed before. In particular, each three year

old produces roughly 5 new offspring, each four year old produces on average 18 new offspring,

and an average 5+ year old produces almost 25 offspring.

     Problem Starting with             ,        ,               ,  ,  , and

                   , create a graph that shows how the population of the cutthroat trout changes
     over time. What does the graph show?

I created this graph in Excel (see the file "cutthroat-life-cycle.xlsx" for the formulas and data):
INFORMAL CALCULUS                                                           191

And here are just the last four stages to get a better look at these ones:
192  TYLER SEACREST

   As we can see, the population seems to be fairly stable. One thing that stands out to me is how
many age zero and age one fish there are compared to other groups.

    stable? That is, the biomass of the forest is not changing from year to year (this is known as a
    fixed point).

2. Find a species of your choosing on the website https://compadre-db.com/ExploreDatabase,
    like we did for the cutthroat trout in the previous section. Use a spreadsheet program to see

                    INTRODUCTION TO DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

S ometimes we don't quite know what kind of function we are dealing with exactly, but we know
some basic things about its derivative. For example, consider how many people live in a town

or city. We'll call this  . One general principle that often holds true for population is that

the rate it is growing is proportional to the size of the population. That is, the bigger the city, the faster

the growth. This is just saying in terms of raw numbers, a city like Hong Kong has the ability to add

people much faster than Dillon, Montana, since Hong Kong is a much bigger city. Now, this doesn't

have to hold: some big cities actually shrink, while some small towns explode in population overnight.

But on average, this is true. It follows the equation

The left hand side represents how fast is growing, and the right hand side represents some

fraction of . The value   is called the growth rate. This is an example of a differential equation.

A differential equation is an equation relating a unknown function and its derivatives. Another way to

write the same differential equation is to use Newton's notation.

Again, this is just saying how fast  is growing is equal to some constant times the size of  .

We'll learn how to "solve" an differential equation later on. But for now, note that

solves this differential equation. Why? We'll, note that           by the chain rule. Hence,

we can verify that        solves this differential equation by using substitution.

   Since we get the same thing on both sides via substitution, we know that the differential equation is
verified! What does this mean? Well, this says that population follows the exponential function
. This means populations eventually start to grow extremely fast.
196                    TYLER SEACREST

   While exponential functions grow bigger and bigger forever, in practice, population growth will
eventually slow or even stop due to geographic or other constraints. No exponential function lasts forever
in real life!

   Let's see a couple other examples of creating differential equations.

   Example Creating Differential Equations

      Problem Let  be the earnings of a large company, measured in millions of

     dollars. This company's growth in earnings is 0.07 times their current earnings.

     What is a differential equation that models this situation?

     We see that growth in earnings is the same thing as derivative. Hence                is the

     growth in earnings, and this is equal to                     times their current earnings, so

                    .

      Problem The growth of a function is less than              times the value of the
        function. What is the differential equation now?

     We see that this can be translated as                        .

Here are some examples of verifying a given solution is correct.

      1. Understand what each variable is measuring with correct units.
      2. Write down what relationship the differential equation is describing in common, no-

           nonsense language.
      3. Explain why those relationships seem to make sense.

Let's do an example with the population equation.

Example Simple Population Growth

Problem A population of snakes is declining according to the model               ,

where  is number of snakes, and is measured in years. Follow the steps above to

explain this differential equation.

1. Understand what each variable is measuring with correct units.

As given in the problem,             is number of snakes at time , is measured in years. Since

       is a rate of change of the snakes, it is snakes lost per year.

2. Write down what relationship the differential equation is describing in common, no-nonsense

language.

    The population of snakes is decreasing, because of the negative sign, in proportion to the
    number of snakes. Hence, a good answer here is "The more snakes you have, the more
    snakes you lose."
3. Explain why those relationships seem to make sense.

Of course we don't know why the snakes are dying off, but it makes sense that the more
snakes you have the more you lose, since there are more snakes with the potential to die.

The next example involves a system of differential equations which makes it a bit more complicated.
A system of differential equations is just like a system of equations: you now have perhaps several
unknown functions, and you want to find all the unknown functions so that all the equations are true
at the same time.

Example Wolves and Deer

     Problem Let  be the population of wolves and               be the population of deer, with

     measured in years. They satisfy the differential equation

     Explain this differential equation.

     1. Understand what each variable is measuring with correct units.

     As given in the problem,             is the number of deer at a given time,  the number of

     wolves, and is measured in years.    is how fast the deer population is changing in

     deer per year, and           the same thing for wolves measured in wolves per year.

     2. Write down what relationship the differential equation is describing in common, no-nonsense

     language.

         We see that a wolf population larger than makes the deer population go down. A deer
         population above 300 makes the wolf population go up.
     3. Explain why those relationships seem to make sense.

     These relationships make sense since if we have a lot of wolves, they hunt the deer and
     the population of deer goes down. If we have a lot of deer, there is a lot of food for the
     wolves, so the wolf population goes up.

Let's look at a rocket equation.

Example Rocket Equation

     Problem A rocket that is blasting off has height in meters and has mass of fuel             in

     kg (here, is measured in seconds). These quantities follow the differential equations

     Use the steps to explain this differential equation.

     1. Understand what each variable is measuring with correct units.

     As given in the problem,             is the height measured in meters,       is the mass of fuel
                              INFORMAL CALCULUS                                                 205

in kg, and is time measured in seconds. We also have    would be the velocity in the

upward direction in m/s, and  is acceleration upward of the rocket in m/s .

is the change in mass of rocket fuel in kg/s.

2. Write down what relationship the differential equation is describing in common, no-nonsense

language.

We see that acceleration,     , is related to           . That means as we lose rocket

fuel, we gain faster acceleration. We also have         in the bottom of the fraction --

that means we gain acceleration more slowly since we are dividing by this quantity. We

also lose 9.8 additional units of acceleration.

The second equation is much simpler -- it just says we are losing rocket fuel at a rate

of 0.1 kg/s.

3. Explain why those relationships seem to make sense.

This is more complicated, but these relationships do make sense. For example, the 9.8
units of acceleration lost are due to gravity. It makes sense that we gain acceleration as we
lose fuel, since we burn fuel to make the rocket go faster. Finally, dividing by
is to account for the fact that the heavier the rocket is, the slower it will accelerate.

                            INITIAL VALUE PROBLEMS

O ften a differential equation has many solutions. Consider the population equation
     We saw in the last section that            solves this differential equation. However,
    also solves this differential equation:

So           and          both solve the differential equation         . In fact, any function

of the form                 solves this differential equation.   is called the general solution, and

is called a free parameter, since it can be anything that we like. However, sometimes there are certain

conditions called initial conditions which specify what the free parameters must be (in which case it

wouldn't be very free!). A differential equation with given initial conditions is called an initial value

problem. I won't ask you to solve the differential equation fully in this book, but solving for the free

parameters is very doable.

Example Initial Value Problem

Problem Solve                     where                         . (Hint: The general solution is
                      ).

In this case, we just need to specify what , since it is the only free parameter. We see that

                  and             . Therefore,                   . Anything to the zero is ,

hence we see                , so       . So the final answer is                      .

Example Another Initial Value Problem

Problem Verify                    satisfies the differential equation  . Then
solve for the free parameter if                 .
210                             TYLER SEACREST
   We see that
                                , and we can compute            using the chain rule:

                                . But notice this exactly fits the differential equation:

Thus we have verified the solution to the differential equation. To find the free parameter ,

we use          , and see that  , and hence                     , and so                   . This

completes the verification and solving for the free parameter.

                   GROWTH AND DECAY

W e've seen a differential equation pop up several times already, and it is the most common and
            simplest of all differential equations:
   When is positive, this is saying that is growing at a rate proportional to the value of the function

at any given point. As we've seen, population tends to follow this rule, but several other things do as

well. When is negative, this is saying that is decreasing at a rate proportional to its value, and this

is true for several things as well. These are called the growth and decay equations respectively.

And there is a simple solution to the differential equation                  . It is               . Let's

see some examples

Example Decay

Problem A radioactive isotope decays at a rate of            times its mass in grams per day.

Initially, a sample contains grams of the isotope at         .

      1. How much of the isotope will there be left at          ?

      2. At what time will there be gram left?

Let    be the mass of isotope in grams at time . Thus,             , since we start with

grams. Since the isotope decays at a rate of                 times its current mass, we see that

                   . The negative is in there because it is a decay rate -- the amount of isotope

is going down. We know the solution to a differential equation like this is

Since              , we also have                                  , and hence                     . Our
                                                                     . We plug in                    and
equation for the mass of the isotope is now

From here, we can now tell how much isotope will be left at

This solves part (1).
To find out when there will be gram left, we solve

                EXPLORING GRAPHS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

I n this section we will focus on differential equations that model climate change. Now compared
    to sophisticated climate models used by climate scientists, this is just a toy model and doesn't cover
    all the complexities of real climate. However, it does show how feedback loops can amplify the
effects of climate change.

   Photo by Ian Barbour
   In terms of global earth temperature, what greenhouse gas is responsible for trapping the most
heat? You may be surprised to learn that it is H O, not CO . Water vapor is a more effective
greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and there is a lot more of it too. So why don't more people talk
about H O in regards to global warming? It's because the amount of H O is not a driving force behind
climate change. The H O is dependent on temperature to begin with. Since you can't increase the H
220                                        TYLER SEACREST

O without increasing temperature, you can't use H O to increase temperature. However, that doesn't

mean H O can be ignored either.

Consider the following set of differential equations.      is the global temperature,                is the

amount of water, and       the amount of carbon.

Problem Follow the steps from the section on understanding differential equations to
understand what this differential equation is saying

Okay, let's go through the steps.

     1. Understand what each variable is measuring with correct units.

     There are no units listed in the problem, so we will make up some reasonable guesses for what

     they are. Anyway, is a measure of time as usual, we could say measured in years after some

     starting date.        is the global temperature, we will say measured in Celsius.               is the

     average concentration of water vapor globally at time , and        is similar for CO . We will

     assume           and          are measured in parts per million, or ppm. Then we have is how

     fast the temperature is changing globally (in degrees Celsius per year),  is the change of

     water concentration (in ppm per year), and is the change in CO (in ppm per year). Note

     that while I "guessed" the units for ,       and , the units for a derivative are forced from

     those choices, so I can't just make up new units for say           . See this chapter on interpreting

     the derivative for more information.

     So what are                   ? Well, we'll talk about these more in the next step but they are

     basically parameters that relate how much of an effect various quantities have on each other.

     2. Write down what relationship the differential equation is describing in common, no-nonsense

     language.

     Let's start with the simplest equation:           . This is just saying that carbon is increasing

     (or decreasing) at a constant rate . This tells us what is as well; assuming is positive, it's

     how fast we're putting carbon into the atmosphere.

     The next simplest equation is                             . Ignoring and for a second, this

     tells us that water vapor increases at a rate that looks like the difference between temperature

     and water vapor. So a hot and dry atmosphere will tend to get wetter, while a cool or damp

     atmosphere might mean a negative difference so it would get less wet. The values of and

     affect the severity of these trends.

     Finally, let's look at the more complicated equation:                                           . Let us
                             INFORMAL CALCULUS                                          221

break that down into two pieces, starting with          . Assuming is positive, the is

basically a constant source of temperature increase. However, as the temperature increases,

we see that the        term will tend to cool things off. We will see in the next step what these

terms really mean. But for now, let's move on to              . This is saying that the bigger

and are, the hotter the earth will get.

3. Explain why those relationships seem to make sense.

We just got done thinking about the equation                  , so let's start

there. Let's focus on        . Why are these terms here influencing temperature? Well, we

said was a constant source of temperature increase -- does that ring a bell? Yes, it's the sun!

Ignoring other effects, we will continue to absorb solar energy until we are hotter than Venus.

So hopefully there is something that will cool us off. In this equation it is the term  . Why

is this term here? Well, it turns out the hotter the earth gets, the more heat energy will be

radiated away. We don't generally see this energy with our eyes, because it is infrared, but it's

there. This      is the basic energy balance that determines the temperature of the earth.

A similar equation would hold true for any planet.

However, to this, we add                 . Why? That's right -- water and carbon are

greenhouse gases, so the more and , the hotter the earth will tend to get. Now

technically, these are really just absorbing that infrared energy from the earth, so they are not

actually separate from the   term, but for simplicity I've just listed them as separate terms.

This is one of many simplifications in this model that a real climate model would correct. It's

important to note at this point that, even though carbon is the driver behind global warming,

it's actually the water that is the better greenhouse gas and much more prevalent. Because of

this, the term should be much larger than the term.

Let's focus now on the                                  equation. We already said that this equation

implies that hot and dry air will tend to absorb more water, while cool and damp air would

lose water. This makes sense since hot air just holds more water. Also, the hot air will heat the

oceans causing evaporation.

Finally, why do we have the equation                    ? Well, the amount of carbon in the

atmosphere is a very complex system. But for simplicity we can say it is increasing at a

constant rate , due mostly to humanity burning fossil fuels.

Okay, now we understand some things about these differential equations, what do they tell us? For
this, we will turn to computers to create some graphs for us. These graphs are all solutions to the
differential equations. And while these graphs won't perfectly depict reality, they will show us some
aspects of climate change you might not realize. We will use this website that graphs the solution for
us. It looks like this:
222  TYLER SEACREST
                        INFORMAL CALCULUS                                                   223

Let's take a closer look at that graph. Note we have  ,  ,  ,                            ,

, and  . Notice that is much smaller than , reflecting how much less of an effect carbon

has compared to water.

Okay, not a lot happening yet. But you can start to get familiar with the graph. First, you'll note

that Global Temperature, Water, and Carbon levels are all around . Note that does not mean the

temperature is C, or that Carbon is ppm. Instead this represents some sort of "relative" value of

these quantities compared to normal. This makes it easier to put these things on the same graph. So

represents normal, would be twice normal, would be half of normal, and so on.

The amount of carbon in the atmosphere related to the value. So if I increase this from     to

about , we see the change in the graph below.
224  TYLER SEACREST

Now the carbon is taking off, but not much is happening to the global temperature. Why is this?
                     INFORMAL CALCULUS                                                         225

Well, notice we set  . This has the effect of keeping the water value constant, even though in

reality it would increase as the temperature increases. So let's see what happens when we set  :

   Now we can see how the temperature increases the water vapor, which furthers increases the
temperature, which further increases the water vapor, and so on. This is a classic example of a climate
feedback loop. The end result is a much higher global temperature with the same basic increase in
carbon. This is consistent with more advanced models, which show that water roughly doubles the
effect of carbon. Note that I don't expect a 25% increase in temperature over the next years - this
is exaggerated to illustrate the relationships.
A couple more things: Suppose we don't increase carbon anymore, but still have that water vapor
effect. What happens? Here, I've left at , but reduced to .
226  TYLER SEACREST

   Clearly, this is much better than when we were increasing carbon so fast. However, notice there is
still an increase in temperature. That's because these feedback loops continue to operate even after
we stop increasing carbon. As a result, scientists expect global temperatures to rise for several decades
even if we manage to become carbon neutral as a planet.

   Finally, the worst-case scenario is as follows. It has the same settings as the previous example, just
with (the effect of water vapor) increased 10%
INFORMAL CALCULUS  227

   This is the "runaway greenhouse effect", where a feedback loop gets out of control, and even with
no additional carbon the temperature increases to the point where the seas boil away. Most scientists
think this isn't possible for earth even with large amounts of additional carbon, but with the right
conditions this sort of thing is possible. Scientists think this is what happened to Venus hundreds of
millions of years ago.

Please feel free to play around with the model yourself!

INTUITION FOR INTEGRATION

                               INTRODUCTION TO INTEGRALS

S uppose construction workers needed to remove dirt in a hill in order to run a road though it.
        The swath needed to be excavated is meters wide, and the hill is parabola shaped. Here is a
        picture:

How much dirt needs to be removed? What do we need to know to solve the problem?
   That's right -- we need to know the volume of the region we're excavating. Here is a picture of the

region we are removing:

Such an object is called a "prism" -- it's basically two dimensional shape that has been given a little
thickness. Finding the volume involves finding the area of the shape times its thickness:

                                                            A

                                                                  10 m
236                                            TYLER SEACREST

In this case, the area is labeled in the diagram, and the width is . So the amount of dirt being

hauled away is . But what is ? How do we find it? That is where integration comes in.

     is a parabola like shape, but let's say it is bounded on top by the function              .

Thus you get a picture like this:

                                                                                                                                                              y = x(50-x)/125

                                                      A

How do we find the area of a curved shape like this? Well, we don't know how to find the area of an
arbitrary curved shape. But we DO know how to find the area of a rectangle: it is height times width.
So let's use rectangles:

                                                               y = x(50-x)/125

                                           10  20   30         40   50

So it's not a great approximation yet, but bear with me. The area of the boxes does approximate the

area under the curve to some extent. But how do we figure out the area of the rectangles? Well, that's

height times width, and we can see that the width of each box is . So we just need the height of each

rectangle.

When I drew each rectangle, I made it so that the right side of the rectangle was exactly the

height of the function. The height of the function is something we can find! That's because we

know the hill follows the function                      . The height of the hill, and the height of the

rectangles can then be found. For example, the height of the first rectangle is just plugging

into our function. So the height is                                                         . The height

of the second rectangle is                                                             . The third rectangle

has height                                                     , the fourth rectangle has height

                                     ,         and             the              fifth  has     height

                                        .

If we take these heights and multiply by the width, we get the area of each rectangle.

Adding up all the area from all the rectangles, we have                                      m . This is an

approximation of the area.

Now you might say that this approximation might not be very good, and you're correct. It certainly

gives the rough idea, which might be all that we need. But if we need a very precise answer, isn't

good enough. So what can we do? Let's use more rectangles!

                                                            y = x(50-x)/125

The idea of using rectangles like this to get better and better approximations of area is called a

Riemann Sum. Now, we could find the height and width of each of those rectangles, but it would

be a bit tedious. Since mathematicians are lazy, we often have a computer do the work for us.

For example, website "MathWorld" has a Riemann Sum calculator: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/

RiemannSum.html. Using this calculator, we can see that when using rectangles, the sum becomes

. This is called numeric integration (If you use more and more rectangles, you can actually find a

very precise answer of        -- this is how the program computes the "actual area". However, this

is still an approximation, not an exact value.)

What does this have to do with the dirt problem? Remember, we were trying to find the volume of
this slice:

                                                         A

                                   10 m

What we have done with the Riemann sums is find                                              . To find how much dirt is hauled

away, we just need to multiply by the width of the prism, which is m. Hence                  cubic meters

of dirt must be hauled away.

T his process of finding the area underneath a curve is used for a lot more than finding how much
        dirt needs to be hauled away -- in fact, it's vital to many physics, engineering problems, and it
        even crops up in environmental science and biology problems. Let's do some more examples to
get a feel for how it works, and to introduce the notation for it.

Given a function  , the area under the curve from  to  looks something like this:

                                                       f(x)

                  x = a                                x = b

   This area is denoted by mathematicians as

   Here, the and indicate the left and right boundaries of the area we are interested in. The and
the you can think of as just part of the notation for now, though they relate to how mathematicians
write finite sums (with the integral being a sort of infinite sum). Sometimes this is called a definite
integral to separate it from an indefinite integral. A definite integral is an area under a curve, and
indefinite integral is an anti-derivative.

   A weird quirk of definite integrals as area is that sometimes the area goes negative! This happens
whenever the function drops below the -axis.

                                                                             f(x)

                                     negative area

Here are some examples.              using five rectangles.
   Example
   Riemann Sum I
      Problem Approximate

First, if we graph this function, we see it looks something like (not to scale)

                                                                                    f(x) = 1/16 x2

                                     x = 4          x = 14

We will approximate the area in this case with five rectangles:

                                                                                    f(x) = 1/16 x2

                                     x = 4          x = 14

This is called the "right rectangle rule", since it is the top right of the rectangles that match the

height of the function.

     We just need to find the areas of these rectangles, add them up, and be done. We see the

width of each rectangle is , since the distance from to is , and there are rectangles. The

heights can be found by plugging in                         into the function. We see the heights are

     ,                        ,             ,               , and                                      . Adding these

up, we see the total area is                                                                        .

                  FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS

I n the previous two sections, we saw that the area under a curve can be found using more and more
    rectangles. However, this process can be tedious and not very enlightening. There is a powerful
    theorem that allows us to compute area under the curve quickly in many cases.
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Given a function  where              is an anti-derivative of  , we have

   This is a really remarkable theorem. At first blush, finding the area under a curve and finding
the slope of a tangent line have nothing in common. What this theorem is saying is that these
are intimately tied, and in fact that are exactly inverse operations. That is, one undoes the other.
Moreover, this gives an exact answer to integral problems, something that eluded us in the previous
sections.

   For example, let's say we wanted to solve the following:

Problem Find      .

To use the fundamental theorem, we need an anti-derivative of             . The anti-derivative in this

case, by the inverse power rule, is  . Therefore               . The answer then is  ,

which is
252                                 TYLER SEACREST

   The area under the curve is   . Note that        is sometimes denoted  We'll see
that in the following examples.

Example

Fundamental Theorem Examples

      Problem Find              .

     To solve this, we find the anti-derivative of  , and then plug in the end points and
     subtract the result. First note that                  .

        Notice how the constants of integration cancel? For definite integral problems, we can
     essentially ignore the constant of integration for this reason.

      Problem Find                 .

     We integrate and then evaluate again.

Why does the fundamental theorem of calculus work? As we have seen earlier, it is sometimes easiest

to see in terms of position versus velocity. Let  be the position function of a car, let  be the

velocity function of the car, and let be the time in hours. For simplicity, let's say     is constant

from  to  :

So if this is the velocity function, what is happening to the position function? As we've seen, we just

need to multiply: its the   times the four hours, gives a change of 40 miles. That means
looks something like this:
254                              TYLER SEACREST

Note it need not start at miles, but that is one possibility.

Now let's look at the fundamental theorem again:

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Given a function      where  is an anti-derivative of          , we have

Can you see why the fundamental theorem worked out in this case? We see see       is just

the change of position between hour and hour , which is        or miles. What is  ?

Well, that's the area under the velocity curve. How do you find area? That's right, it's multiplication!

In particular, it is  times the four hours, again giving a change of miles.

You can see how both area under the curve and antiderivatives come down to the same basic
calculation. That's why the fundamental theorem of calculus can claim they are the same thing.

   If the velocity function is more complicated, this still works. We can think of a more complicated
function as a combination of these constant functions.

     HOMEWORK: THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS

1. What is the fundamental theorem of calculus saying? Think intuitively, big picture, etc. Use
    your own words.
    There are some possible answers I'm looking for:
             Area under the curve can be computed using an anti-derivative
             Integrals and derivatives cancel!
             Finding area is related to finding slopes
             Finding area and finding slope are inverse operations
             To find how far something has gone using a velocity graph, use the area under the
               curve.

                           PROJECT: MEASURING STREAMFLOW

P urpose of the project: Apply numeric integration techniques to a real-world problem.

How do you measure streamflow? The basic idea is simple: it is area times velocity. For example,
suppose you had a river that was feet wide, feet deep, and had water moving at feet per second.
Then we multiply the and the to get an area of ft , and the multiply by the ft per second
to get ft per second. This works great if you have a rectangular river where the water moves at
a constant velocity. But what if the river is not a rectangle? What if the velocity changes depending
on where in the river you are? How can you find the streamflow? And what does this have to do with
numeric integration techniques?

      1. Come up with two different ways to find streamflow in a river. Why do they work? And how
           do they relate to the numeric integration techniques we studied?

      2. Try both methods on the virtual river (see river.html). I recommend using a spreadsheet to
           record your data and to automatically do the calculations for you.

      3. If you have access to a flow meter or some method of calculating water velocity, try out both
           methods in a real river. Which method do you feel worked better? Why?

   In 1959, an 7.2 magnitude earthquake caused a massive landslide in southwest Montana near
Yellowstone National Park. 28 people were killed in the quake, and the landslide created a natural
dam of the Madison river which created a new lake called Earthquake Lake or Quake Lake. See this
travel blog for some additional photos and diagrams. The area where the land slid away is still mostly
barren of trees today.
   The main question behind this project: roughly how much volume of rock and earth was moved in
the landslide?
260  TYLER SEACREST

     1. What are some possible ways to figure how much volume?
     2. Using Google Earth and USGS topographical maps, give a very rough estimate of how many

         cubic meters or cubic feet of earth was moved in the landslide.
     3. Find an online reference for the volume of the landslide. Is your number high, low, or just

         right? Can you guess why your estimate was off in the direction it was?

            POWER, EXPONENTIAL, TRIG, AND LOGARITHM RULES

W e've already seen the inverse power rule, but here it is again:

Note that this only works if     . However, we haven't seen how this works with fractional

and negative powers yet. We'll do some examples of this.

We can also "undo" the derivatives for exponential, logarithmic functions, or trigonometric

functions.

On to the examples. Recall that  and                      .

Example

            Negative and fractional powers work the same way as the positive powers we've been
            working with. We see

     At this point, let's just type it into a calculator to get an approximate answer. We see

     that the integral is about     .

     This problem becomes an inverse power rule problem if we notice that  . We

     For this problem, you may be tempted to write this as    and use the inverse power

     rule. Good instincts, but in this case it won't work (try it: it leads to division by zero!). So

     instead, let's invert the natural logarithm derivative.

                                U-SUBSTITUTION

R ecall the chain rule:

   The method of " -substitution" is a way of doing integral problems that undo the chain rule. It also
helps deal with constants that crop up.

-substitution:

1. Identify an "inside" function whose derivative is multiplied on the outside, possibly with a
    different constant. Call this "inside" function .

2. Compute and solve for .

3. Use substitution to replace  and                     , and cancel any remaining terms if

possible.

4. Integrate with respect to . If at this point you still have any s in your problem, either you

made a mistake or the method of -substitution will not work for this problem.

5. Substitute back the s back into the answer before evaluating the definite integral.

Let's do some examples.

Example -substitution

Problem Find             .

We will follow the steps of substitution.

1. In this case, the "inside function" is            .

2. If we compute         , we see the derivative of     is . Hence  and we have

There we go.

Example -substitution

Again, we will go through the steps of -substitution.

1. The inside function in this case is  . We can see that the derivative is , and this

is good since there is an multiplied out in front (the is just a constant we can deal

with.) Set             .

2. We see              , and hence solving for we have    .

3. Subbing in             and           , we have

     4. We can now integrate with respect to .

     5. Finally, we sub in the s again using               .

     Since this is an indefinite integral, we add the constant of integration.

1. The inside function in this case is   . We can see that the derivative is , and this is

good since there is an dividing the rest of the problem. Set  .

2. We see          , and hence solving for we have         .

3. Subbing in      and                   , we have

       Great, the s are all gone!
4. We can now integrate with respect to .

5. Finally, we sub in the s again using             .

If the inside function is linear, the -substitution is much simpler, and there is even a formula for it

(just like in the  example above). By the chain rule with     and  , we have
278                                         TYLER SEACREST

   If we integrate both sides of this equation, we have the following useful rule which I call the "chain
rule shortcut":

This is especially important if             . In this case, we have

In other words, you integrate just like normal without any -substitution, and then add a  factor

for the fact that you have       inside the function instead of just an .

Let's see a couple of examples of this:

Example Chain rule shortcut

      Problem Find                      .

     Using the inverse power rule, we see this becomes               . However, we need that

     factor since the problem has a            in it. So the final answer is

        You'd get the same thing doing a full -substitution with              . This way,
     though, you save some time by just multiplying by .

      Problem Find                         .

     Again, we use the -sub shortcut -- we just need to do power rule and remember a

                       INTEGRAL APPLICATIONS

I n derivative story problems, often you're given a function that describes the amount of something,
    and you're asked to find the rate of change. With integral story problems, the reverse is often true.
    You'll be given a function the describes the rate of change over time, and you'll be asked to get the
amount.

Problem At time        seconds, train starts with velocity meters per second, and eventually

gets up to a speed of  meters per second at time              seconds. How far has it gone from

to               ?

Discussion: We know that distance is equal to velocity multiplied by time. So if we can figure out the
train's velocity, we can just multiply by seconds and get an answer. So here are some potential
answers:

Why can't we just go with meters per second? Because the train "eventually" gets up to meters

per second doesn't mean it was going meters per second the whole time -- most of the trip it may

have been going slower. So the answer of           meters (or kilometers) is an upper bound, but

isn't the final answer. We need more information.

Problem (Additional information) The speed of the train is given by the function
meters per second.

What this additional information is telling us is that there isn't just a single velocity we can use and

multiply by the     seconds -- instead, the velocity is changing all the time so there are lots of

velocities. Since the train goes from to meters per second, can we just use the "average" which is

meters per second? Well, let's look at the speeds over time:
286                            TYLER SEACREST

You can see the train spends much more time above 20 m/s than it does below, so that the train

probably goes farther than     meters ( km).

What about the speed at time   which is  m/s? Can we use this value? Well, let's see what

that would mean visually. That's basically treating the speed at the half-way point like it is a constant

velocity:

So if we use a velocity of     meters per second, that would give a final distance of

           meters (22.6 km). But even this isn't quite right. The train spends an equal

amount of time slower than     and faster than , but the slow region (from time to time

) is slower than the fast region (time to time ) is fast. They don't exactly cancel, so likely the

train won't quite reach        km. Somehow, instead, we need to take into account the speed of the

train at every instant. Sound familiar? This is where an integral is going to come it. Basically if we take

the speed of the train at a small time frame, and multiply by the time it is going that speed, you get a

picture that looks like this:
INFORMAL CALCULUS  287

   This is of course just the area under the curve! So we use the fundamental theorem of calculus to
find the actual answer:

   A quick check to see if this is reasonable: we're saying the train went 21.3 km in those 13 minutes.
Seems a bit fast for a train but not impossible. It's less than our max of 32 km, but more than the guess
of 16 km that we thought it would beat. Seems reasonable!

12. Submarine Navigation

      Nuclear submarines spend months underwater with no access to GPS or similar navigation
      techniques. Instead, they use a "dead reckoning" approach where accelerometers are used to
      keep track of how fast they are moving, from which their position can be determined. A
      submarine starts not moving at all. Given the following list of accelerations, estimate how far
      the submarine has gone.

                             INTEGRATION BY PARTS

R ecall the product rule:    and , this becomes
   If we use and instead of

Now let's integrate both sides and solve for

   Flipping this around, we have the inverse product rule, also called integration by parts.

   The tricky part is what to use as , and what to use as . Here are some steps and guidelines
to follow, but it takes some intuition building before you know how to use it sometimes, and some
product integrals cannot be solved with integration by parts.

Integration by parts:

      1. Think of your original integral as a product. Identify a function that is easy to integrate, and
           set it equal to . The other function should be something that will simplify nicely once you
           take the derivative.

      2. Find (take the derivative of ) and find (integrate )
      3. Using substitution, plug in the values for , , and in the integration by parts formula.
      4. This gives you another integral -- hopefully this one is easier. If not, you may need to use

           -substitution, or even integration by parts a second time.

Example Integration by parts

     Problem Find      .

Let's follow the integration by parts steps:

     1. The function we are integrating is , which is a product in two pieces: and .

     While is easy to integrate, is even nicer. We will start with    , and             .

     2. We see                , and                 (you don't need to worry about the
         for now).

     3. Using the formula with       ,           ,  , and  , we have

     4. We now have reduce the problem to an easier one:   . We continue:

     So the answer is                         .

Notice if the problem contains an variable, then this is usually a good choice for since it will
go away once you take the derivative .

   Problem Use integration by parts to find

This one will involve integration by parts and a -substitution shortcut. Here are the steps of
integration by parts:

1. We can integrate either function, but just like the previous case it's best to set         .

This leaves                   .

2. We see                     . Notice                     is a bit harder -- this is a -sub

shortcut though. Let's write it as                         . Using the inverse power rule, and

remembering the factor from the -sub shortcut, we have

     3. Applying the formula with  ,       ,       , and          , we see

     At this point, doing the integral of          may not seem easy. However, don't

     fret -- it's a power rule and -sub shortcut problem. Watch.
