Units

Introduction

Engineering is a field of study that involves a very high level of
calculations. Thus students of engineering must become familiar with a
wide range of formulas and computational methods. Virtually all the
calculations that engineers perform involve the use of units. Because many
calculations involve the use of multiple units, an engineer must become
competent in the process of unit conversions. Unit conversions allow an
engineer with the ability to convert units in one system of measurement
(say, the British system of measure) to those of another system (say, the
System Internationale or SI system of measure.)

Units and unit conversion are important not just to engineers, but all
members of society. Everyday activities such as driving an automobile,
shopping at a grocery store, or visiting an pharmacy illustrate situations
where an individual experiences units and unit conversions. Let us consider
driving an automobile. A simple glance at a vehicle's speedometer reveals
that the speed of the vehicle can be expressed in the units miles/hour or
kilometers/hour. Depending upon the country in which you reside, gasoline
is sold in the units of gallons or liters. At the grocery store, the volume of a
can of your favorite soda is often expressed in terms of ounces or milliliters.
Likewise, the dosage of cough syrup that you obtain from your local
pharmacy can be expressed in terms of the units ounces or milliliters. This
list of examples from everyday life that involve units can be expanded
without bound.

Whenever an engineer deals with a physical quantity, it is essential that
units be included. Units are especially important to engineers for they
provide the ability for engineers to express their thoughts precisely and to
provide meaning to the numerical values that result from engineering
calculations. Units provide a means for engineers to communicate results
among other engineers as well as laymen.

Units are an integral part of what could be called the language of
engineering. As a student of engineering, you should become accustomed to
the inclusion of units with virtually all your answers to engineering
problems. Failure to include units with your numerical results can lead to
your having points deducted from your grades on assignments, laboratory
exercises and examinations.

Metric Mishaps

Failing to include the proper units with the results of engineering
calculations can lead to unanticipated failures in engineering systems.
Serious errors that result from the dual usage of metric and non-metric units
are often grouped under the heading of metric mishaps. Some common
examples of metric mishaps include the following:

      According to the National Transportation Safety Board, confusion
      surrounding the use of pounds and kilograms often results in aircraft
      being overloaded and unsuited for flight.
      The Institute for Safe Medication Practices has reported that confusion
      between the units grains and grams is a common reason for errors
      associated with the dosage of medication.

A Notable Engineering Failure: The NASA Mars Climate Orbiter

In 1999, NASA experienced the failure of its Mars Climate Orbitor
spacecraft because a Lockheed Martin engineering team used English units
of measurement while a NASA engineering team used the more
conventional metric system for a key spacecraft operation. (NASA, 1999).
This mismatch in units prevented the navigation information from
transferring properly as in moved between the Mars Climate Orbiter
spacecraft team in at a Lockheed Martin ground station in Denver and the
flight team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

Working with NASA and other contractors, Lockheed Martin helped build,
develop and operate the spacecraft for NASA. Its engineers provided
navigation commands for Climate Orbiters thrusters in British units
although NASA had been using the metric system predominantly since at
least 1990.

After a 286 day journey, the spacecraft neared the planet Mars. As the
spacecraft approached the surface of Mars, it fired its propulsion engine to
push itself into orbit. Instead of the recommended 276 kilometer orbit, the
spacecraft entered an orbit of approximately 57 kilometers. Because the
spacecraft was not in the proper orbit, its propulsion system overheated and
was subsequently disabled. This allowed the Mars Climate Orbiter to plow
through the atmosphere out beyond Mars. It is theorized that it could now
be orbiting the sun

The primary cause of this discrepancy was human error. Specifically, the
flight system software on the Mars Climate Orbiter was written to
calculate thruster performance using the metric unit Newtons (N), while the
ground crew was entering course correction and thruster data using the
Imperial measure Pound-force (lbf). This error has since been known as the
metric mixup and has been carefully avoided in all missions since by
NASA.

Unit Conversion Procedure

The process of transforming from one unit of measure to another is called
unit conversion. One can easily perform unit conversion using the
procedure that will be presented in this section. You will soon discover that
performing unit conversion can be reduced to multiplying one measurement
by a carefully selected form of the integer 1 to produce the desired
measurement.
Prior to presenting the procedure of unit conversion, it is important to
understand a simple fact. Numbers with units such as 25.2 kilometers or
36.7 miles can be thought of and treated in exactly the same manner as
coefficients that multiply variables, such as 25.2 x or 36.7 y. Of course here,
x and y are variables.

From Algebra, we know that we can always multiply a quantity by 1 and
retain its value. The key idea of unit conversion is to choose carefully the
form of 1 that is used. We will illustrate this idea by means of an example.

Suppose that we wish to convert 25.2 kilometers to miles. In order to
accomplish this conversion of units, it is important that one know the
following information
Equation:

                                                                  1km = 0.621mile

Let us take this equation and divide each side by the term 1 km, as shown
below
Equation:

1km     0.621mile

     =

1km     1km

Clearly the left hand side of this equation is equal to 1. That is
Equation:

1=   0.621mile
           1km

This will serve as our conversion factor to solve our problem at hand. It is
important to remember that this conversion factor is nothing more than a
carefully selected form of the number 1.

Let us return to the quantity 25.2 kilometers that we wish to convert to
miles. We can apply the conversion factor as follows
Equation:

                     0.621mile     25.2km × 0.621mile

           25.2km ×             =

                     1km               1km

We observe that the unit (km) appears in both the numerator and
denominator and can be removed from the from the fraction. So our result
is
Equation:

                                             25.2km × 0.621mile = 15.65miles

Thus we establish the result that 25.2 km is equivalent to 15.65 miles.

In obtaining the result, we developed a fraction that was equal to the integer
1. We then multiplied our original quantity by that fraction to give rise to
our result. This is the basic idea behind unit conversion.

A Two-Step Procedure for Producing Correct Unit Conversion Factors

Here we will present a simple two-step procedure that produces the
conversion factor that can be used to convert between a given unit and a
desired unit. For the purpose of illustration, let us use the conversion
between the given unit (pounds) and the (desired) unit of kg.

Step 1: We begin by writing an equation that relates the given unit and the
required unit.
Equation:

                                                                      1kg = 2.205lb

Step 2: Convert the equation to fractional form with the desired units on top
and the given units on the bottom.

Equation:

                     k             lb
           1kg         2.205lb

                    =

           2.205lb     2.205lb

Equation:

           0.454kg     =1
                  lb

So to covert from pounds to kg we may use this as the proper conversion
factor.

Another Notable Engineering Failure: The "Gimli Glider"

Like the NASA Mars Climate Orbiter, the "Gimli Glider" incident is an
engineering failure that can be attributed directly to the errors involving the
mismatch of units. The "Gimli Glider" is the nickname of the Air Canada
commercial aircraft that was involved in an incident that took place on July
23, 1983. In the incident, a Boeing 767 passenger jet ran out of fuel at an
altitude of 26,000 feet, about midway through its flight from Montreal to
Edmundton via Ottawa. The aircraft safely landed at a former Canadian Air
Force base in Gimli, Manitoba, thus contributing to the nickname
associated with the aircraft. (New York Times, 1983) We will trace some of
the steps that led to the incident while making use of data drawn from the
website (Wikipedia).

Air Canada Flight 143 originated in Montreal. It safely arrived in Ottawa on
its first leg. At that time, the pilot properly determined that the second leg
of the flight (from Ottawa to Edmundton) would require 22,300 kilograms
of jet fuel. The ground crew at the Ottawa airport, performed a dipstick
check on the fuel tanks. They measured that there were 7,682 liters of fuel
onboard the aircraft upon its arrival to Ottawa.

Based on these data, the air and ground crew proceeded to calculate the
amount of jet fuel that would need to be transferred to the fuel tanks in
order to assure safe arrival in Edmundton. However, they used an incorrect
conversion factor in their calculations. At the time of the incident Canada
was converting from the Imperial system of measurement to the metric
system. The new Boeing 767 aircraft were the first of the Air Canada fleet
to calibrated to the new system, using kilograms and liters rather than
pounds and Imperial gallons.

The crew wished to convert the 7,682 liters of fuel to its equivalent went in
kilograms. In order to do so the crew applied an incorrect conversion factor
(1 liter of fuel weighs 1.77 kg.) Actually, 1 liter of fuel weighs 0.803
pounds, but the crew used an improper weight.

The crew inaccurately calculated ed the weight of the fuel onboard the
aircraft to be 13,597 kilograms. The erroneous calculation is shown below.
Equation:

         1.77kg

7,682 ×          = 13 597kg

           1

Next, the crew went about determining the weight of fuel that would need
to be transferred to the fuel tanks. They found this to be 8,703 kilograms, as
shown in the differencing operation below
Equation:

                                                22 300kg - 13 597kg = 8,703kg

Finally, the volume of fuel in liters that needed to be transferred to the fuel
tanks before departure for Edmundton was calculated. Once again, the
erroroneous conversion factor was used as shown below
Equation:

8,703kg ×        1  = 4,916
           1.77kg

As consequence of these steps, the ground crew transferred 4,916 liters of
jet fuel into the fuel tanks. Both the air and ground crews incorrectly
believed that this volume of jet fuel (4,916 liters) would be sufficient to
insure a safe arrival in Edmundton. Unfortunately, the sequence of
calculations contained errors and the aircraft was forced to glide to a safe
landing well short of its desired target.

Let us now examine the steps of calculation that should have been
performed and that would have enabled a safe landing of the aircraft in
Edmundton. We first determine the correct weight of fuel that remained in
the fuel tanks upon the aircraft's arrival in Ottawa. Here, we use the proper
conversion information. That is one liter of jet fuel weighs 0.803 kilograms.
Equation:

           1 = 0.803kg

Equation:

           1     0.803kg

              =

           1                    1

Equation:

           1=    0.803kg
                        1

Equation:

                                0.803kg

           7,682 × 1 = 7,682 ×           = 6,169kg

                                   1

So only 6,169 kilograms of fuel remained in the fuel tank when the aircraft
landed in Ottawa. The next step involves the determination of how much
fuel needed to be transferred to the fuel tank in order to accomplish the
flight to Edmundton. This is properly computed by differencing the weight
of the fuel needed to accomplish the flight to Edmundton and the weight of
the fuel remaining in the fuel tanks.
Equation:

                                                22 300kg - 6,169kg = 16 131kg
Thus a quantity of jet fuel weighing 16,131 needed to be transferred by the
ground crew into the fuel tanks in order to insure the safe arrival of the
aircraft in Edmundton. This weight of fuel (kilograms) can be converted to
a volume (liters) as follows
Equation:

           1 = 0.803kg

Equation:

           1           0.803kg

                    =

           0.803kg     0.803kg

Equation:

              1.245    =1
                  kg

Now this conversion factor can be used to determine the number of liters of
fuel that should have been transferred to the fuel tanks.
Equation:

           16 131kg × 1 = 16 131kg ×  1.245   = 20 088
                                          kg

We conclude that 20,088 liters of fuel needed to be transferred to the fuel
tank to successfully complete the leg of the flight from Ottawa to
Edmundton. This represents approximately 4 times as many liters of fuel as
was incorrectly calculated by the air and ground crew in 1983. The
inadequacy in the provisioning of fuel resulted in the "Gimli Glider" having
to perform an emergency landing well short of its desired arrival location.
Due to some skillful piloting of the aircraft, no one onboard was seriously
injured.

Summary
This chapter has attempted to illustrate the level of importance that
engineering students should assign to the topic of units. In addition, a
procedure that allows for the conversion of a quantity expressed in one unit
to another unit has been presented. This method is quite simple in that all it
requires is that one multiply the quantity expressed in the original unit to be
multiplied by a fractional form that is equal to the integer 1. A process for
correctly determining the proper fractional form is presented also.

Engineering students should view mastering the topic of units as an
importance step in their formal education as an engineer. They should keep
in mind that virtually all problems in engineering courses will involve
solutions that include units.

Events surrounding the NASA Mars Climate Orbiter and the "Gimli
Glider" show how seemingly small mistakes involving units and conversion
factors can cause failures to complex systems.

Significant Digits
This module is part of a collection of modules intended for students
enrolled in PreCalculus (MATH 1508) at the University of Texas at El Paso.

Significant Digits

Introduction

Though easy to comprehend, significant digits play an important role in
engineering calculations. In this module, the rules are presented that govern
how to determine which digits present in a number are significant. In
addition, several applications are used to illustrate how significant digits
can be used to express the results of engineering calculations.

Basic Rules

A number can be thought of as a string of digits. Significant digits represent
those digits present in a number that carry significance or importance to the
precision of the number.

Rule 1: All digits other than 0 are significant. For example, the number 46
has two significant digits and the number 25.8 has three significant digits.

Rule 2: Zeros appearing anywhere between two non-zero digits are
significant. Let us consider the number 506.72. The 0 that occurs between
the 5 and 6 is significant according to Rule 2. Thus the number 506.72 has
five significant digits.

Rule 3: Leading zeros are not significant. For example, 0.00489 has threee
significant digits.

Rule 4: Trailing zeros in a number containing a decimal point are
significant. For example, the number 36.500 has five significant digits.

Rule 5: Zeroes at the end of a number are significant only if they are behind
a decimal point. Let us consider 4,600 as the number. It is not clear whether
the zeros at the end of the number are significant. As a result, there could be
two, three or four significant digits present. To avoid ambiguity, one may
express the number by means of scientific notation. If the number is written
as 4.6 ×103, then it has two significant digits. If the number is written as
4.60 ×103, then it has three significant digits. Lastly, if the number is
written as 4.600 ×103, then it has four significant digits.

Rounding

The concept of significant digits is often used in connection with rounding.
Rounding to n significant digits is a more general-purpose technique than
rounding to n decimal places, since it handles numbers of different scales in
a uniform way.

Let us consider the population of a town. The population of the town might
be known to the nearest thousand, say 12,000. Now let us consider the
population of a state. The might be known only to the nearest million and
might be stated as 12,000,000. The former number might be in error by
hundreds while the latter number might be in error by hundreds of
thousands of individuals. Despite this, the two numbers have the same
significant digits. They are 5 and 2. This reflects the fact that the
significance of the error (its likely size relative to the size of the quantity
being measured) is the same in both cases.

The rules for rounding a number to n significant digits are:

Start with the leftmost non-zero digit (e.g. the "7" in 7400, or the "4" in
0.0456).

      Keep n digits. Replace the rest with zeros.
      Round up by one if appropriate. For example, if rounding 0.89 to 1
      significant digit, the result would be 0.9.
      Or, round down by one if appropriate. For example, if rounding 0.042
      to one significant digit, the result would be 0.04
Multiplication and Division

In a calculation involving multiplication, division, trigonometric functions,
etc., the number of significant digits in an answer should equal the least
number of significant digits in any one of the numbers being multiplied,
divided etc.

The product, 4.56 × 3.456, involves the multiplication of a number with
three significant digits and another with four significant digits. The product
should be expressed as a number with three significant digits. Using a
calculator the number, 15.75936, appears on the display of the device. It
should then be rounded to three significant digits. So the product expressed
using three significant digits is 15.8. Note that in this example, upward
rounding was employed.

Addition and Subtraction

The results that one obtains through the operations of addition and
subtraction follow the following rule. The result of addition and subtraction
should have as many decimal places as the number with the smallest
number of decimal places. For example the sum 13.678 + 2.59 should be
expressed as 16.27.

Something to Remember

When performing calculations, you are encouraged to keep as many digits
as is practical. This practice will help you obtain more precise results by
eliminating some of the error introduced by the rounding operation. Once
you have a final answer, then one should go about applying the rules
presented in this section to produce a result that is consistent from the
standpoint of significant digits.

Example: Finding Current Using Ohm's Law
Let us put to work the ideas put forth earlier in the context of an example
that involves calculations centering on Ohm's Law. Let us suppose that we
are presented with the circuit shown in Fig. 1.

Electric circuit.

Suppose that the voltage (V) is 15 V and that the resistance is (R) 3.3 k.
What is the value of the current (I)?

Ohm's Law tells us that the current is the ratio of the voltage and the
resistance.
Equation:

                                                                                            V
                                                                               I=

                                                                                            R

Substituting the values for V and R into the equation yields the result
Equation:

I=                    15V  = 0.004545454A
                   3,300
Now, let us consider this result in the context of significant digits. Both the
voltage and the resistance were expressed using two significant digits. We
realize that the resulting value for the current (I) should contain two
significant digits. We can accomplish this by expressing the result after
rounding to two significant digit precision.
Equation:

                                                                        I = 0.0045A

Thus the answer to this example should be expressed as 0.0045 A.

We may choose to express this number using engineering notation and the
result becomes
Equation:

                                                                                                                           -3

                                                      I = 4.5 × 10 A = 4.5mA

This is the preferred manner for expressing the result.

Example: Finding Acceleration by means of Newton's Law of Motion

Sir Issac Newton was the first to formulate the relationship between force,
mass and acceleration of an object. He found that a force (F) exerted on an
object of mass (m) will produce an acceleration (a) according to the
following equation
Equation:

                                                                              F = ma

Let us assume that we have a mass that weighs 120.6 kg. How much force
is required to accelerate the mass at a rate of 26.1 m/s2?

We recognize that the value for mass is expressed using four significant
digits, while the value for the acceleration is expressed using only three
significant digits. We substitute the values for mass and acceleration into
Newton's Law of Motion
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                        2

                                                        F = 120.6kg × 26.2m/s

Equation:

                                                                      F = 3147.66N

The number (3147.66) represents what is displayed on the calculator upon
calculation of the product. This number has six significant digits. We wish
our result to be expressed by the smaller of the number of significant digits
contained in the two numbers that were multiplied. In this case the number
should be expressed using just three significant digits. So the result
expressed using three significant digits is
Equation:

                                                                         F = 3,150N

In order to remove any uncertainty relating to the trailing 0, the result can
be written in engineering notation as
Equation:

                                                                         F = 3.15kN

This is the preferred form for the solution.

Adding Fractions
This module is part of a collection of modules written for students enrolled
in a Pre Calculus Course for Pre Engineers (MATH 1508) at the University
of Texas at El Paso. The module introduces how fractions can be added
through the use of the lowest common denominator method. To illustrate
the principle, an introduction to Ohm's Law is presented. In addition, the
rules that govern the determination of the equivalent resistance of series and
parallel connections of resistors are introduced. Finally, exercises involving
the addition of fractions in the context of parallel connections of resistors
are included to emphasize the importance of the lowest common
denominator method in engineering calculations.

Adding Fractions

Introduction

In order to enjoy success as an engineer, it is important to learn how to add
fractions. In this module, you will learn to add fractions using the lowest
common denominator (LCD) method. Also, you will learn the role that the
addition of fractions plays in determining the equivalent resistance of
resistors connected in parallel.

Lowest Common Denominator (LCD) Method

In the course of working algebraic problems, one often encounters
situations that require the addition of fractions with unequal denominators.
For example, let us consider the following
Equation:

3      1

    +

10     12

In order to add the two fractions, it is important to rewrite each fraction
with the same denominator. In order to accomplish this, we begin by
expressing the denominator of the first fraction in terms of a product of its
factors
Equation:

                                                                           10 = 2 × 5

We do the same with the denominator of the second fraction
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                       2

                                                         12 = 2 × 2 × 3 = 2 × 5

We can express the lowest common denominator as
Equation:

                                                                                                                    2

                                                          LCD = 2 × 3 × 5 = 60

We proceed to express the sum of fractions using the lowest common
denominator just found
Equation:

3      1      3×6        1×5         18                                                                                   5                               23

    +      =          +           =                                                                                    +      =

10     12     10 × 6     12 × 5      60                                                                                   60                              60

Thus we obtain the result of the addition as 23/60.

Let us consider another example in which three fractions are to be added
Equation:

                   2     3     5

                      +     +

                   3     2     7

The denominator of each fraction is a prime number, so the lowest common
denominator is their product
Equation:
                       LCD = 3 × 2 × 7 = 42

We must rewrite each fraction as an equivalent fraction with a denominator
of 42
Equation:

                       2          2×2×7         28

                           =                 =

                       3          3×2×7         42

Equation:              3          3×3×7         63
Equation:
                           =                 =

                       2          3×2×7         42

                       5          5×3×2         30

                           =                 =

                       7          3×2×7         42

Next, we express the sum of fractions using those equivalent fractions just
determined
Equation:

2          3     5     28         63     30     28 + 63 + 30     121

   +          +     =      +          +      =                =

3          2     7     42         42     42         42           42

So 121/42 is the desired result.

Application: Combining Resistors in Parallel

Figure 1 depicts a physical device known as a resistor. A resistor is often
used in an electrical circuit to control the amount of current that flows
throughout the circuit. The relationship between voltage, current and
resistance in an electric circuit is governed by a fundamental law of Physics
known as Ohm's Law. Stated in words, Ohm's Law tells us that the
potential difference (V) measured in Volts across a resistor is directly
proportional the current (I) measured in Amps that flows through the
resistor. Additionally, the constant of proportionality is the value of the
resistance (R), measured in Ohms. Ohm's Law can be stated
mathematically as
Equation:

                           V = IR

Photograph of a resistor.

Instead of a single resistor, electric circuits often employ multiple resistors.
Let us consider the case where we have two resistors that are denoted as R1
and R2.

The two resistors can be connected in an end-to-end manner as shown in
Figure 2 (a).
                   Series and parallel connections of resistors.

Resistors connected in this manner are said to be connected in series. We
may replace a series connection of two resistors by a single equivalent
resistance, Req. From an electrical standpoint, the single equivalent
resistance will behave exactly the same as the combination of the two
resistors connected in series. The equivalent resistance of two resistors
connected in series can be calculated by summing the resistance value of
each of the two resistors.
Equation:

                                                                     Req = R1 + R2
Let us now consider the case where the two resistors are placed side-by-side
and then connected at both ends. This situation is depicted in Figure 2 (b)
and is called a parallel combination of resistors. Whenever resistors are
connected in this manner, they are said to be connected in parallel. The
equivalent resistance of two resistors connected in parallel obeys the
following relationship.
Equation:

      1           1        1

               =        +

      R eq        R1       R2

Once this quantity is calculated, one may easily take the reciprocal of the
result to obtain the value of Req.

The rule governing the determination of the equivalent resistance for the
series connection of more than two resistors can be expanded to
accommodate any number (n) of resistors. For n resistors connected in
series, the equivalent resistance is equal to the sum of the n resistance
values.

In addition, the rule governing the determination of the equivalent
resistance for the parallel connection of more than two resistors can be
expanded. For n resistors connected in parallel,
Equation:

1           1        1         1

      =        +        +

R eq     R1       R2           Rn

It is clear to see that one's ability to determine the equivalent resistance of
parallel resistors depends upon one's ability to add fractions. The following
exercises are included to reinforce this idea.

Example 1: Two resistors are connected in series. The value of resistance
for the first resistor is 5 , while that of the second is 9 . Find the
equivalent resistance of the series combination.
Equation:
                    Req = 5 + 9 = 14

Example 2: Consider the two resistors presented in Example 1. Let the two
resistors now be connected in parallel. Find the equivalent resistance of the
parallel combination.
Equation:

                    1           1       1

                           =        +

                    R eq        5       9

The lowest common denominator is 45 . So we incorporate it into our
analysis.
Equation:

                    1           9       5

                          =         +

                    R eq        45      45

Equation:

                          1         14

                                =

                          R eq     45

Equation:

                    Req =    45     = 3.21
                               14

Example 3: Three resistors of values 2 k, 3 k, and 5 k are connected in
parallel. Find the equivalent resistance.
Equation:

           1        1               1         1

                 =           +             +

           R eq     2,000       3,000         5,000
The lowest common denominator for the fractional terms is
Equation:

                                       LCD = 2 × 3 × 5 × 1,000 = 30,000

We rewrite the original equation to reflect the lowest common denominator
Equation:

                  1        15         10         6

                        =          +          +

                  R eq     30,000     30,000     30,000

Equation:

                               1      31

                                   =

                           R eq       30,000

Req =  30,000     = 968
              31

Exponents
This module is part of a collection of modules that present topics covered in a
PreCalculus (MATH 1508) class at the University of Texas at El Paso.

Exponents

Introduction

Exponentiation is a mathematical operation that is employed extensively in
applications in fields that range from science and engineering to finance and
economics. This module will begin with a brief discussion of the terminology and the
mathematics involved with exponentiation. This will be followed with some
applications of exponentiation in science and engineering.

Scientific notation and engineering notation are introduced in this module as two
common means for expressing physical quantities. Each of these representational
schemes involve the use of exponents. Applications are presented on topics including
electrical power, gravitatitational force and electrostatic force are presented as a
means for illustrating how exponentiation can be useful in problem solving.

Definition and Terminology

Exponentiation is an operation in mathematics that makes use of two numbers known
as the base (x) and the exponent (n) and is expressed as
Equation:

                                                                                                                                              n

                                                                                                 x

In this module, we will restrict our discussion to situations where the exponent (n) is
an integer. Being an integer, the exponent may be positive, negative or equal to 0. We
will consider each case below.

If the exponent n is a positive integer, then the operation of exponentiation is
equivalent to the multiplication of the base x with itself a total of n times.

In the situation where the base (x) is 5 and the exponent (n) is 3, we obtain the result
Equation:

                                                                                                                3

                                                                            5 = 5  5  5 = 125
Now, let us the case where the exponent is a negative integer. In this case, the process
of exponentiation is equivalent to dividing one by the base x by n times.

Let us consider an example where the base (x) is 5, but now the exponent (n) is -3. In
this example, we obtain the result
Equation:

              -3 1 1

           5  =         =                         = 0.008

                 555         125

Suppose that we form the product of 53 with 5-3.
Equation:

              3     -3
              5 ×5      = 125 × 0.008

Equation:

                    5   3-3  =1

Equation:

                            0

                        5 =1

The result of the multiplication reminds us of the property of exponents that states
whenever a base (x) is raised to an exponent (n) that is zero, the result is 1.

Scientific and Engineering Notation

One of the most important uses of exponents in the fields of science and engineering
is that of scientific notation. As is often the case, in the fields of science and
engineering one often deals with numbers that are extremely large or extremely small.
Scientific notation is an effective means for writing such number that makes use of
exponents. In many cases, scientific notation enables one to write very large or very
small numbers in a manner that is more convenient, insightful and compact that
writing numbers using decimal notation.

Numbers can be written in scientific notation in the following form
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                        b

                                                                                           a × 10
where a is the coefficient which can be any real number in the range 1 < |a| <10 and b
is an integer that represents the exponent.

Example (Avogadro's Number)

In chemistry, the quantity of an element having a weight in grams numerically equal
to that element's atomic weight is the gram atomic weight of that element. This
quantity is often refererred to as a gram atom. A gram atom of any element contains
the same number of atoms as the gram atom of any other element. The number of
atoms in any gram atom is called Avogadro's number (N). Through meticulous
experimental study, the value of Avogadro's number has been determined as
Equation:

                                                  N = 602,300,000,000,000,000,000,000

Question: How can Avogadro's number be expressed in scientific notation?

Solution: Avogadro's number can be written as the product of a real number (6.023)
by the term (100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000)
Equation:

                                        N = 6.023 × 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                       23

                                                                             N = 6.023 × 10

Rather than trying to perform calculations using the decimal form for Avogadro's
number, chemists have learned to appreciate the more mathematically tractable
scientific notation form of this important constant.

Engineering notation is quite similar to scientific notation. Numbers are written in
engineering notation in the following form
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                        c

                                                                                           a × 10

where the coefficient a is a real number in the range 1 < |a |< 1,000 and the exponent
c is restricted to be an integer multiple of 3.
An additional restriction on the coefficient (a) requires that a be expressed using no
more than 3 significant digits. The restriction that the exponent be an integer multiple
of 3 allows the numbers that result from the transformation to engineering notation to
be expressed using the standard prefixes associated with the Scientifique
Internationale (SI) system of units.

Example (Width of the Asteroid Belt)

Let's consider the following application of engineering notation. The width of the
asteroid belt has been determined to be 280,000,000 m.

Question: What is the width of the asteroid belt expressed in engineering notation?

Solution: Let us begin by expressing this quantity using scientific notation
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                         8

                                                              280,000,000m = 2.80 × 10 m

We notice that the exponent is not an integer multiple of 3, so this quantity is not yet
expressed in engineering notation. We do know that
Equation:

           8        2+6  2          6

           10 = 10       = 10 × 10

This quantity can be substituted into the previous equation to yield the expression for
the width of the asteroid belt in engineering notation
Equation:

                                                                                                            8

           280,000,000m = 2.80 × 10 m

Equation:

                            2                                                                                  6

           280,000,000m = 2.80 × 10 × 10 m

Equation:

                                                                                                                                          6

           280,000,000m = (2.80 × 100) × 10 m

Equation:

                                                                                                         6

           280,000,000m = 280 × 10 m
Equation:

           280,000,000m = 280Mm

Application: Electrical Power

We will begin our investigation of applications of exponents with a discussion of
electrical power. Consider the electrical circuit diagram that shows a source voltage
(V) attached to a resistor (R) to produce a current (I).

The relationship between V, R and I is summarized by Ohm's Law
Equation:

                                                                                      V = I ×R

where V is measured in volts (V) , I is measured in amps (A), and R is measured in
ohms ().

   Simple electric circuit.

We may write an expression for the current as
Equation:

                                                                                                       V
                                                                                           I=

                                                                                                       R
The power that is absorbed by the resistor is known to be the product of the current
flowing through the resistor time the potential difference (voltage) across the
terminals of the resistor. If we denote the power absorbed by the resistor as PR, then
it can be expressed mathematically as
Equation:

                                                                                     PR = I × V

Substitution of the expression for I obtained from Ohm's Law yields an equivalent
expression for the power absorbed by the resistor
Equation:

        V V2

PR = (     )V =

        R        R

Paying attention to the exponent, we can say that the power absorbed by the resistor
is the square of the voltage across the terminals of the resistor divided by the
resistance. The units associated with power are Watts (W).

We can obtain an alternative form for the power absorbed by the resistor. We begin
with the general expression for the power absorbed by a resistor
Equation:

                                                                                     PR = I × V

If we now substitute the expression for V provided by Ohm's Law into this equation,
we obtain an alternative expression for power
Equation:

                                                                               PR = I  (I × R)

Equation:

                                                                                                                                                      2

                                                                                       PR = I R

This relationship expresses the electrical power absorbed by the resistor as a product
of the square of the current by the resistance.

Thus we have two equally useful formulas for the computation of the power absorbed
by a resistor. One involves the square of the voltage, while the other incorporates the
square of the current. Each formula involves a term that is raised to an exponent of 2.
Example (Electrical Power)
A 9 Volt battery is connected to a single 10 k resistor.

Equation:

                         -4          V2

                   PR = 81 × 10 (                      )

                                     

Equation:

                         -1                            -3

                   PR = 81 × (10 × 10 )W

Equation:
                                    -1       -3

                     PR = (81 × 10 ) × 10 W

Equation:                                                                -3
Equation:
                     PR = 8.1 × 10 W

                     PR = 8.1mW

Gravitational Force

Every object of finite mass near the surface of the earth experiences a force that pulls
it downward. This force is called weight. In the 17th Century, Sir Isaac Newton
postulated that this force which attracts objects to the earth might well be a particular
example of a more general kind of interaction between objects. Newton was engaged
in the study of the motion of planets around the sun and felt that the planets should
obey the same laws of motion as objects falling toward the earth due to their weight.
In one of humankind's greatest bits of insight, Newton discovered that the forces
responsible for both planetary motion and the phenomenon of weight could be
equally understood if one hypothesized that every object of finite mass attracts every
other object of finite mass with a force that depends upon the individual masses of the
objects. Such forces are known as gravitational forces and they serve as a basis for
what is now known as Newton's law of gravitation.

Let us consider two objects of respective masses m1 an m2 that are separated by a
distance that we denote as r. Newton's law of gravitation states that each object will
exert on the other an attractive force, directed along a straight line connecting the two
objects. The magnitude of the force that mass m1 exerts on m2 is equal to the
magnitude of the force that m2 exerts on m1. The magnitude of the force that the first
mass exerts on the second is provided by the equation
Equation:

                                    m1m2

                     F =G                 .

                                    r2

Here, G represents the universal gravitational constant and is given by
Equation:

                                    -11      2                               2

                     G = 6.67 × 10       N - m /kg .
Because the universal constant is so small, the gravitational forces that exists between
objects of ordinary mass are extremely small.

We can incorporate the value for G along with the use of exponents in the equation
for the magnitude of the force to yield the expression that follows.
Equation:

                               -11       2  2                      -2

           F = (6.67 × 10           Newton - meter /kg )(m1 m2 )r

Thus we can see that exponents play an important role in the formulation of Newton's
law of gravitation. Exponents are important to the expression of the universal
gravitational constant and the attractive force between two objects depends upon the
reciprocal of the square of the distance between the objects.

Example (Gravitational Force)

The mass of the sun is 2 × 10 kg 30 . The mass of the earth is 5.97 × 10 kg 24 . The
approximate distance between the sun and the earth is 149.6 × 10 km. 6

Coulomb's Law

Electrons and protons are examples of charged particles. In the case of the proton,
charge is positive. The charge of a proton is thus said to have positive polarity. On the
other hand, an electron has a negative charge. Thus the charge of an electron is said to
have negative polarity.

An electrostatic force exists between two charged particles. If the charges associated
with the two particles are of the same polarity, the electrostatic force will be
repulsive. On the other hand if the charges for two particles have opposite polarity,
the electrostatic force will be attractive.

Through extensive laboratory work, the physicist Charles Coulomb first established a
mathematical expression that calculates the magnitude of the electrostatic force that
results from the interaction of two charged particles. This expression which is known
as Coulomb's law for electrostatic forces is given by
Equation:

                                  (  )
                                          qQ

                                  F = k(      )

                                          r2

where q and Q are the values of the charges measured in the units Coulombs, r is the
distance measured in meters that separates the charged particles and k is a constant
Equation:

                               9                    2      2

k = 9 × 10 Newton - meters /Coulomb

It is interesting to note the similarity of the general form of Coulomb's law for
electrostatic forces with Newton's law of gravitational force. Just as was the case with
the gravitational force, the magnitude of the electrostatic force decreases with the
square of the distance separating the two particles.

Example (Electrostatic Force)

The charge on an electron is given by the equation
Equation:

                                        -19

qe = -1.60 × 10                              Coulombs(C )

Equation:

                                        -19

qp =+1.60 × 10                               Coulombs(C )

Suppose that an electron and a proton are separated by a distance of

        -6

10 nanometers.

                         F = 230N

Because the charges on the electron and the proton differ in polarity, the electrostatic
force is attractive.

Linear Equations
This module is part of a collection of modules intended for students
enrolled in a PreCalculus (MATH 1508) course for PreEngineers at the
University of Texas at El Paso.

Linear Equations

Introduction

This module is intended to illustrate concepts related to the solution of
engineering problems using straight lines. It has formed the basis of a
Laboratory session associated with a MATH 1508 (Precalculus) course
taught at the University of Texas at El Paso. The examples contained herein
are drawn from the fields of fluid mechanics, mechanics, and electric
circuits. Exercises are included at the end of this module.

Fluid Mechanics - Continuity Equation

Figure 1 illustrates a piping system that consists of two pipes. Pipe1 has a
radius of r1 while the radius of Pipe 2 is r2. These two pipes are joined so
that water can pass from the left to the right.

Quite some time ago, engineers observed that the velocity of a fluid in Pipe
1 (v1) for such a system would be quite a bit lower in value than the velocity
of the fluid in Pipe 2 (v2). As a consequence, engineers sought a means for
determining the relationship between the velocity of fluids in the two pipes
that comprise this sort of system.

Their solution to the problem of determining the relationship between the
two velocities (v1 and v2 ) is provided by a very important principle in fluid
mechanics that is called the continuity equation. The continuity equation
states
Equation:

                                                                        A1v1 = A2v2
where A1 represents the cross-sectional area of Pipe 1 and A2 represents the
cross-sectional area of Pipe 2. For the continuity equation to be valid it is
important to recognize that the flow of water be continuous as it passes
from the first to the second pipe.

Connection of two pipes of different sizes.

By rearranging terms in equation (1), we can formulate an equivalent
expression that may be a bit more insightful
Equation:

           A1v1      A2v2

                  =

           A2        A2

Equation:

              A1

           (      )v1 = v2

              A2
Equation:

                                                A1

                                    v2 = (          )v1

                                                A2

Thus we can conclude that the ratio of the area of the two pipes provides a
multiplicative constant relating the velocities of the fluid in the two pipes.

We recall that the equation for a straight line takes the form
Equation:

                                                                          y = mx + b

Equation (4) indicates that there is a linear (straight line) relationship

between the velocity (v2) of the fluid in the second pipe and the velocity
(v1) of the fluid in the first pipe. If we establish v1 as the independent
variable, then the dependent variable v2 is defined as a linear function of v1.

The  slope  (m)  of  the  line  is  the  ratio  of  the  cross-sectional                                           areas  (  A2  ),
                                                                                                                             A1

while the y-intercept (b) is zero.

Let us now apply our knowledge of the continuity equation to a problem.

Question: Suppose that the radius of Pipe 1 is 4.00 cm and the radius of
Pipe 2 is 2.50 cm. The velocity of the water in Pipe 1 is measured to be 3.00
m/sec. Find the velocity of the water in Pipe 2.

Solution: We begin our solution by establishing the cross-sectional areas of
each pipe. Because the cross-sectional profile of each pipe is a circle, we
may compute the two cross-sectional areas using the formula for the area of
a circle:
Equation:

                                                                                                                2

                          A1 = r12 = (4.00cm)

Equation:
                                                                                                 2

           A2 = r22 = (2.50cm)

We can apply equation (4) to find the velocity of the fluid in Pipe 2. The
steps are shown below
Equation:

                   (4.00cm)2

           v2 = (  (2.50cm)2  )(v1 )

Equation:

           v2 =    16.00
                                  (v1 )

                    6.25

Equation:

           v2 = 2.56v1

Equation:

           v2 = 2.56 × 3.00m/s

Equation:

           v2 = 7.68m/s

If we compare our result for the velocity of the fluid in Pipe 2 with the
velocity of fluid in Pipe 1, we immediately see that the velocity of the fluid
increases as it moves from a pipe with a larger cross-sectional area to
another pipe with a smaller cross-sectional area. This result is intuitive with
what we may have observed through personal experience.

Question: Make a plot that relates the dependent variable (v2) and the
independent variable (v1).

Referring to equation (10), we note that a linear relationship exists between
v2 and v1. For the straight line, the slope is 2.56 and the y-intercept is 0. We
plot the line below

              Graph of the linear relationship between velocities.
It is important to note that each axis is labeled and includes the units
associated with each variable.
Mechanics - Velocity and Acceleration
Let us consider a car that is traveling at an unknown initial velocity (v0).
The driver of the car decides to enter the on-ramp of a freeway. The driver
knows that he will need to increase his velocity in order blend in with the
other traffic on the freeway. While situated in the on-ramp, the driver of the
car applies pressure to the accelerator of the car. Let us consider that this
action occurs at a specific instant of time (t0). By applying constant pressure
on the accelerator, the driver causes the car to accelerate at a constant
acceleration (a).

This constant acceleration causes the velocity of the car to increase. During
the time interval that the driver applies constant pressure to the accelerator,
the velocity of the car can be expressed as a function of time
Equation:

                                                                      v(t) = at + v0

Inspection of this equation reveals that the velocity is a linear function of
time. Here the dependent variable would be velocity and the independent
variable would be time. The slope of the straight line that is associated with
the equation would equal to the acceleration (a). The y-intercept of the
equation would be the initial velocity (v0).

Let us apply what we have learned about the relationship between velocity
and acceleration coupled with our knowledge of linear equations to work a
problem.

Question: At an instant of time (t1 = 1.00 s) after depressing the
accerlerator, the driver observes that the car is traveling at a velocity (v1 =
17.00 m/s). At an instant of time one second later (that is at t2 = 2.00 s), the
driver observes that the velocity of the car has increased to a value (v2 =
22.0 m/s). Determine the initial velocity of the vehicle and the value for the
constant acceleration (a).

Solution: We know the values of the velocity at two instants of time, 1.00
seconds and 2.00 seconds. Because the acceleration is constant, we also
know that the relationship between velocity and time is linear.

The slope of the line that relates velocity to time is equal to the acceleration
(a) and the y-intercept corresponds to the intial velocity (v0).
We begin by stating the two points on the line which are known. They are

(t1, v1) and (t2, v2). The numerical values of these points are (1.00 s, 17.00
m/s) and (2.00 s, 22.00 m/s) respectively.

Our knowledge of straight lines tells us that we can calculate the slope
through a differencing operation
Equation:

               m=  v2 - v1
                   t2 - t1

Next we enter the numerical values of the problem
Equation:

           m=  22.00m/s - 17.00m/s
                          2.00s - 1.00s

Equation:

                                                                 2

               m = 5.00m/s

We can therefore conclude that the acceleration is 5.00 m/s2. We can
incorporate this value into the linear equation that relates velocity to time
Equation:

                                                                                                                                             2

                                                         v(t) = (5.00m/s )t + v0

Either of the data points can be used to solve for the intital velocity. Let us
substitute the values associated with the first data point into the equation.
We obtain
Equation:

                                                                                                                                       2

                                      17.00m/s = (5.00m/s ) × (1.00s) + v0

Equation:
Equation:  17.00m/s = 5.00m/s + v0
                         v0 = 12.00m/s

So we conclude that the initial velocity of the vehicle is 12.00 m/s and the

constant acceleration of the car while it is situated on the on-ramp is 5.00
m/s2.

Electric Circuits - Variable Source Voltage

Suppose that we are presented with an electric circuit that contains a fixed
voltage source (v), a variable source voltage (vs) and a resistor (R). This
situation is shown in Figure 3. In this figure, the variable source voltage is
indicated by the circle and represented by the variable vs. Its units are Volts.
The current that flows through the circuit is indicated by the variable i and
flows in the direction indicated by the arrow. The current has the units
Amps. The fixed voltage source is represented by the constant v.

Electrical circuit with a variable
          source voltage.
One of the most important laws of Physics that govern the behavior of
electric circuits is Kirchoff's Voltage Law. This law states the algebraic sum
of the voltage drops experienced as one passes through a complete path
through a circuit is equal to zero.

Application of Kirchoff's Voltage Law to this circuit yields the equation
Equation:

                                                                  -vs + Ri + v = 0

The terms of this equation may be arranged to produce the following
equation
Equation:

                                                                         vs = Ri + v

Let us consider the source voltage (vs) as the dependent variable and the
current (i) as the independent variable. Examination of the equation reveals
that there is a linear relationship between vs and i. For this linear equation,
the value of the resistor (R) is the slope and the fixed voltage (v) represents
the y-intercept.

Let us apply our knowledge of linear equations to solve a problem
associated with this circuit.

Question: It is observed through measurement that the when the variable
source voltage is 6.00 Volts, the current takes on the value of 1.00 Amp.
When the variable source voltage is raised to 12.00 Volts, the current rises
to a value of 1.50 Amps. Find the values for the resistance and the fixed
voltage.

Solution: We can draw some insight into the solution of this problem by
applying our knowledge of straight lines.
Let us begin by finding the value of the slope or equivalently the value of
the resistance. We have two ordered points to consider (1.00 A, 6.00 V) and
(1.50 A, 12.00 V). The slope of the line that connects these two points is
Equation:

           m=  v2 - v1
               i2 - i1

Equation:

           m=  12.00V - 6.00V
                1.50A - 1.00A

Equation:

           m = 12.0(V /A)

We recognize that the ratio (volts/amps) is equivalent to the unit (). We
make the substitution to yield
Equation:

                                                                          m = 12.0

Earlier we stated that the slope of the line would be equal to the value of the
resistance, so we have the following result
Equation:

                                                                           R = 12.0

The next step in the solution is to solve for the value of the fixed voltage.
Incorporation of the slope that was just found into the equation of the line
yields the equation
Equation:

                                                          vs = 12.0(V /A) × i + v
Let us substitute the values 1.00 A and 6.00 V into this equation
Equation:

           6.00V = 12.00(V /A) × 1.00A + v

Equation:

           6.00V = 12.00V + v

Equation:

           v = -6.00V

So we conclude that the value of the fixed voltage is -6.00 V and that the
value for the resistance is 12.0 .

Quadratic Equations
This module is part of a collection of modules that were developed to
support laboratory activities in a Precalculus for PreEngineers (MATH
1508) at the University of Texas at El Paso. Contained in this module of
applications of quadratic equations in various fields of engineering and
science. These include the motion of an object under constant acceleration,
quantitative management, and break-even analysis.

Quadratic Equations

Introduction

Quadratic equations play an important role in the modeling of many
physical situations. Finding the roots of quadratic equations is a necessary
skill. Being able to interpret these roots is an important ability that is
important in understanding physical problems. In this module, we will
present a number of applications of quadratic equations in several fields of
engineering.

Determining the Roots of Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation has the following form
Equation:

Because a quadratic equation involves a polynomial of order 2, it will have
two roots. In general, a quadratic equation will either have two roots that
are both real or have two roots that are both complex. For the present
module, we will restrict our attention to quadratic equations that have two
real roots.

There are three methods that are effective in solving for the roots of a
quadratic equation. They are:
      Solution by factoring
      Solution by completing the square
      Solution by the quadratic formula

The applications that follow will include examples of each of these three
methods of solution.

Motion of an Object under Uniform Acceleration

We will begin our study of quadratic equations by considering an
application that you will likely encounter later in physics and mechanical
engineering classes. Let us consider an object that is subject to a uniform
acceleration. By uniform, we mean an acceleration that is constant. Such an
object might be an automobile, an aircraft, a rocket, etc. The motion of an
object subjected to uniform acceleration can be expressed mathematically
by the following equation.
Equation:

where s(t) represents the position of the object as function of time t,

a represents the constant acceleration of the object,

v0 represents the value of the object's velocity at time t = 0, and
s0 represents the position of the object at time t = 0.
An equation of this sort is called an equation of motion. We will illustrate
its use in the following exercise.

Example 1: For our first example, let us consider a dragster on a drag strip
of length one-quarter mile. For time t < 0, the dragster is at rest at the
starting line. At time = 0, the driver depresses his gas pedal to produce a
uniform acceleration of 50 m/s2. Under these conditions, how far will the
dragster travel in 1 second?
Because the dragster travels in a horizontal direction, we will represent its
distance from the starting point as a fuction of time as x(t). We also know
that the value for the acceleration (a) is 30 m/s2. We can incorporate these
changes in equation (1) to produce a new equation of motion for the
dragster.
Equation:

Because the dragster is initially motionless, its initial velocity (v0) is 0. Also
since the dragster is situated at the starting point at time t = 0, its initial
position (x0) is 0. We substitute these values into (2) to obtain
Equation:

We can determine the distance that the dragster travels in 1 second by
substituting the value 1 for t.
Equation:

Thus we conclude that the dragster travels 25 meters in its first second of
travel.
Example 2: How far will the dragster travel in 2 seconds?
We may make use of the same equation (2) as before. In this case, we
substitute 2 for t to obtain the distance traveled by the dragster in 2 seconds.
Equation:
Example 3: Most drag strips are one-quarter mile in length. Assuming that
the acceleration remains uniform, how long will it take the dragster to
complete the one-quarter mile strip?
Because the equation of motion for the dragster is written is MKS units, we
must convert one-quarter mile to meters. We can do so by applying the unit
conversion factor 1 mile = 1,609.344 m. Thus,
Equation:

Once again, equation (2) can be used to model the motion of the dragster.
We will use this equation to solve for the amount of time (t1) that it will
take the dragster to travel 402.3 meters. The steps are shown below.
Equation:

Equation:

Equation:

Equation:
So we conclude that it will take the dragster slightly 4.01 seconds to
complete the quarter mile track.

Projectile Motion

Just as we could model a dragster as an object under constant acceleration,
we can also model a projectile using a similar approach. A projectile is an
object that is hurled into the air. Rockets, missiles and artillery shells are
examples of projectiles.

Projectiles experience uniform acceleration as they travel through the sky.
The uniform acceleration is due to the gravitational pull exerted on the
projectile by the Earth. This acceleration is denoted as g. It value in the
MKS system is 9.8 m/s2. In the British system of units, the value of g is
equal to 32 ft/s2.

Let us represent the height of a projectile as a function of time as y(t). Let
us represent the initial velocity in the vertical direction of the projectile and
the initial height of the projectile to be v0 and y0, respectively. We can
incorporate these constants into equation (1) to develop the following
equation of motion for a projectile.
Equation:

The presence of the minus sign in the equation of motion for a projectile is
due to the fact that the gravitation force exerted on the projectile is directed
toward the Earth which is opposite to the direction of increasing vertical
position.

We can use this equation to model the height of a projectile as a function of
time. The following exercises illustrate this principle. In the next three
exercises you can ignore any affects due to the atmosphere or wind.
Example 4: Let us consider a bottle rocket that is launched at time (t = 0)
from a flat surface. The initial velocity of the bottle rocket is 124 ft/s.
Determine the height of the bottle rocket 1.5 seconds after it is launched.
Clearly v0 is 124 ft/s. Since the bottle rocket is launched from the surface,
the value for y0 is 0. We will substitute these values into the equation of
motion for a projectile.
Equation:

Next, we substitute 32 ft/s2 for g. We use this value because in this
exercise, we make use of the British system of units.
Equation:

To find the height of the bottle rocket at a time 1.5 seconds after its launch,
we make the substitution t = 1.5 s.
Equation:

Equation:

So we conclude that the bottle rocket attains a height of 150 ft at a time 1.5
seconds after launch.
Example 5: Let us enforce that same conditions on the bottle rocket as were
presented in Example 4. Find the length of time it will take for the bottle
rocket to strike the surface.
In order to determine the time at which the bottle rocket will strike the
surface, we must find the value for t that leads to a height of 0. As before,
we make use of the equation of motion
Equation:

Because we are interested in determining when the bottle rocket hits the
surface, we set the left hand side of the equation to 0
Equation:

If we restrict the units of t to seconds, we can simplify this equation
Equation:

The left hand side of the equation can be factored as
Equation:

The roots of this equation can be found by setting each factor to 0. That is
Equation:

Equation:
As a consequence, the root associated with the first factor which is 0
corresponds to the time of the launch. The second equation yields the root,
7.75 seconds. This root corresponds to the time at which the bottle rocket
strikes the surface.
Example 6: Let us consider the same bottle rocket as before, but with one
major exception. In this exercise, assume that the launch site of the bottle
rocket is moved to a bluff whose height is 100 ft above the surface. Find the
length of time it will take for the bottle rocket to strike the surface below
the bluff.
The situation is depicted in Fig 1.

                             Flight path of a projectile.
Once again, we will make use of the equation of motion for a projectile.
However in this case we establish the term y0 as 100 ft. This is due to the
bottle rocket being launched from the bluff which is 100 ft above the
surface. Thus we have
Equation:

To find the length of time in seconds at which the bottle rocket will strike
the surface, we must solve for the roots of the following quadratic equation.
Equation:

The quadratic formula provides us with a simple way to determine the roots
of a quadratic equation of the form
Equation:

The quadratic formula tells us that the roots of this equation are given in
terms of the coefficients (a, b, and c) as follows
Equation:

For our problem we express the roots as
In the problem at hand, the values for a, b, and c are -16, 124, and 100
respectively. Substitution of these values into the quadratic formula yield
Equation:
Further arithmetic manipulation on this expression leads us to determine the
two roots to be -0.736 and 8.49 seconds. The first root is not physically
possible, so it can be ignored. The second root (8.49 seconds) tells us the
time at which the bottle rocket will strike the surface.

Quantitative Decision Making

Industrial engineers are often tasked by firms to make decisions that affect
manufacturing operations. In making decisions, industrial engineers must
weigh a variety of factors. These factors include cost, safety, regulatory
constraints, ergonomics and others.

In determining which design alternatives for manufacturing are the best,
industrial engineers often form mathematical models. With such models,
decisions can be made that are optimal in terms of various criteria. The
following exercise illustrates the sort of decision making that might be
involved in a hypothetical manufacturing situation.

Example 7: A manufacturing firm produces commercial aircraft. The firm
plans to expand its manufacturing operations to produce aircraft by opening
a second plant at another site. An industrial engineer oversees the
manufacturing operations for the firm and is charged with making decisions
that impact the operations at the new site.

The industrial engineer has a deep understanding of two processes that
could be used to govern manufacturing at the new site. For convenience let
us refer to these two processes as process A and process B. The industrial
engineer knows that manufacturing cost is a very important issue with the
firm. In researching the two options, the industrial engineer has determined
mathematical expressions that express the manufacturing cost for each of
the two options.
In order to produce n aircraft during a 30-day production run, the cost in
millions of dollars associated with process A is known to be
Equation:

The cost in millions of dollars associated with manufacturing n aircraft over
the same span of time for process B is known to be
Equation:

Which process has the lowest associated cost?
We begin the process of determining which process is most cost effective
by forming the difference between the cost associated with process A and
the cost associated with process B. Let us designate this difference by the
variable D
Equation:

Whenever D is greater than zero, one may conclude that the cost associated
with process A is greater than that associated with process B. Whenever D
is less than zero, one may conclude that the cost associated with process B
is greater than that associated with process A. The cost is the same for each
process whenever D equals zero.
D is a quadratic polynomial, so we begin by solving its roots using the
equation below
Equation:
We can solve for the roots of this equation using the method commonly
known as solution by completing the square. Let us rearrange the equation
with the terms involving n2 and n on the left hand side and the constant on
the right.
Equation:

If we add ¼ to the left and the right sides we obtain
Equation:

The left hand side can be expressed as the square (n + ½)2. We reflect this
below
Equation:

If we take the square root of each side, we are left with
Equation:

This yields the pair of roots 3 and -4.
Let us recall that the variable n represents the number of aircraft produced
during a 30-day production run. The root (-4) is physically impossible for it
is impossible to produce a negative number of aircraft. The remaining root
(3) tells us that the cost associated with process A is equal to the cost
associated with process B when 3 aircraft are produced during a 30-day
production run.
The term D can be expressed as
Equation:
We can tell much about the nature of the plot of D by examining this
equation. D is a parabola with a vertex at (-1/2, -12.25). The parabola would
be concave positive. The parabola would cross the n-axis at the values of
the roots, namely -4 and 3. Figure 2 presents a sketch of D as a function of
n.

This sketch presents us with invaluable information with regard to weighing
the costs associated with the two manufacturing processes. To begin, we see
that the value of D is positive for values of n > 3. We interpret this to mean
that whenever the number of aircraft produced in a 30-day production run
exceeds the number 3, it is more cost efficient to implement manufacturing
process B. Alternatively, whenever the number of aircraft produced in a 30-
day production run is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 3,
manufacturing process A is the most cost efficient. If 3 aircraft are
manufactured in a 30-day production run, the costs associated with process
A and process B are equal.
      Plot of the difference in cost for competing plans as a function of
                                      production.

Here we recognize that it is physically impossible to manufacture a negative
number of aircraft. Thus we may ignore the part of the curve to the left of
the D axis.

Summary
A thorough knowledge of quadratic equations is crucial for an engineer.
This module has presented several applications of quadratic equations in the
context of problems that occur in the study of engineering. We see that the
motion of dragsters, the flight of rockets and determining the most cost-
effective approach to competing manufacturing processes involve quadratic
polynomials and equations.

Rational Expressions and Equations
This module is part of collection of modules developed for use by students
enrolled in a special section of MATH 1508 (PreCalculus) for preengineers.
This module introduces several engineering applications which are based
upon rational expressions and equations.

Rational Expressions and Equations

Introduction

We have seen that much of the analysis that it takes to simplify rational
expressions and to solve rational equations is an outgrowth of the
mathematics associated with fractions. In most cases, one can begin to solve
a problem involving a rational equation by factoring the polynomials that
are constituents of the rational equation. Then, one may seek to identify if
there are any common factors in the numerator and denominator that cancel
with one another. If there are, cancelling these terms will often make our
job of solving the equation simpler.

The fields of science and engineering are filled with rational equations that
describe many different application areas. In this section of notes, we will
focus on how rational expressions and equations are solved in several
different applications. Before we do so, let us examine an example that
involves the manipulation of rational expressions to solve a numerical
problem involving positive integers.

Numerical Problem Involving Rational Expressions

Question: One positive integer is 3 more than another positive integer.
When the reciprocal of the smaller integer is added to the reciprocal of the
larger integer, the resulting sum is ½. Find the positive integer.

As a reminder the reciprocal of an integer is 1 divided by the integer. For
example, the reciprocal of 10 is 1/10.
Solution: We begin the solution by defining the variable x.

Let x = smaller positive integer

With this definition of x, we know that the larger positive integer can be
expressed algebraically as (x + 3).

Using the definition of the reciprocal, we can translate the problem
statement into a rational equation
Equation:

           1           1                        1

           ( )+(            )=

           x           x+3                      2

The rational equation consists of three fractions. The lowest common
denominator for these three fractions is (x)(x + 3)(2). We can multiply
each side of the rational equation by the lowest common denominator to
obtain the equation
Equation:

           1           1                                                          1

(2)(x)(x + 3){( ) + (       )} = (2)(x)(x + 3)

           x           x+3                                                        2

We can simplify things on a term by term basis
Equation:

Equation:  2(x + 3) + 2(x) = x(x + 3)
Equation:
Equation:                                                                      2

                 2x + 6 + 2x = x + 3x

                                                                     2

                       4x + 6 = x + 3x
                                                                                                       2

                                                                     x -x-6 = 0

This quadratic equation can be solved a variety of ways. One simple way to
do so is to employ factoring.
Equation:

                                                                (x - 3)(x + 2) = 0

The roots are therefore x = 3 and x = -2.

From the problem statement, we know that the solution for x must be
positive. We therefore can ignore the root of -2.

Our answer is therefore 3.

Rate Applications

Engineering and science abound with problems that make use of rates.
Examples of rate include concepts such as speed which is a measure of the
rate of change of distance per unit of time. Flow rates are common in fluid
mechanics problems. The flow rate of liquid in a pipe can be expressed as a
number of liters of liquid per unit of time.

An important consideration in working rate problems is to recognize that a
rate can be written as a ratio of the quantity of a particular entity over time.
The following two examples illustrate the use of rates to solve engineering
problems.

Computing the Time It Takes to Finish a Construction Project

Civil engineers perform important duties in the management of construction
projects. Suppose that a civil engineer is charged with the the completion of
a construction project. The civil engineer knows that if he (she) hires
Subcontractor A to complete the construction project, it will take 10
months. On the other hand, if Subcontractor B is hired, the construction
project can be completed in 15 months

Instead of hiring just one of the subcontractor, the civil engineer decides to
hire both Subcontractor A and Subcontractor B. By doing so, the civil
engineer expects the project to be completed more quickly.

Question: How long will it take both subcontractors working together to
complete the construction project?

Let us begin by considering Subcontractor A. Working alone, it would take
Subcontractor A 10 months to complete the project. If we consider the
completion of the construction project as a job, then Subcontractor A can
complete (1/10) of the job in one month. Another way to look at this is that
the rate at which Subcontractor A can complete the job is as (1/10)
job/month.

Now, let us look at Subcontractor B. Working alone, it would take
Subcontractor B 15 months to complete the construction project. Thus
Subcontractor B can complete (1/15) of job in one month. The rate of
Subcontractor B can be stated as (1/15) job/month

Let us define the variable t

t = the time that it takes to complete the entire job using both of the
subcontractors,

where t is measured in months.

In a length of time equal to t, the fraction of the job that Subcontractor A
can complete is equal to the product
Equation:

   1         t

(      )t =

   10        10
Similarly the fraction of the job that Subcontractor B can complete in the
same length of time is
Equation:

                                 1                                                     t

                            (       )t =

                               15           15

We may obtain the fraction of the job that can be completed in an interval
of time equal to t by adding the fraction associated with the Subcontractor
A to that of Subcontractor B, which is 10 + 15 t t

If we set this sum to one, we obtain a rational equation that can be solved to
produce the amount of time that it will take both subcontractors working
together to complete the entire job
Equation:

                            t          t

                                    +       =1

                            10         15

The solution follows
Equation:

                            15t        10t

                                    +       =1

                            150        150

Equation:

                            15t + 10t

                      150(                ) = 150(1)

                               150

Simplification of this equation yields
Equation:

                                                                            25t = 150
From this, we conclude that the two subcontractors working together can
complete the job in 6 months.

Motion of an Automobile Using Two Different Speeds

Question: Suppose that you are interested in taking an automobile trip to
visit a friend in Van Horn, Texas. On your journey, you will travel 40 miles
inside the City of El Paso. Once you leave the city limits of El Paso, you
will have to travel an additional 90 miles to reach Van Horn. Because of
traffic, you anticipate that your average speed within the city limits of El
Paso will be only half of the average speed once you leave the city limits.
You also project that the total time of your trip from El Paso to Van Horn
will be 2.5 hours,

What is your average speed within the city limits of El Paso? What would
be your average velocity outside the city limits?

Solution: We begin by defining the following variable

x = average speed (miles/hr) within in the city limits of El Paso.

The speed at which you would drive outside the city limits would be twice
that of the velocity within the city limits. Thus

2 x = average velocity (miles/hr) outside the city limits of El Paso.

The amount of time that you would spend driving in El Paso would be
Equation:

                                                                               40miles
                                                                                       x

The amount of time that you would spend driving outside the city limits
would be
Equation:

                                                                                            l
            90miles
                  2x

If we sum these together we obtain the total time of the trip
Equation:

40miles     90miles

         +            = 2.5hr

x              2x

This rational equation can be solved as follows
Equation:

2(40)miles     90miles

            +           = 2.5hr

2(x)           2x

which can be simplified as
Equation:

                                                                   170miles = 5xhr

We solve this for x to obtain the result of 34 miles/hr. This represents the
average speed within the city limits of El Paso. Outside the city limits
would be twice that within the city limits or 68 miles/hr.

Radicals
This module is part of a collection of modules intended for students
enrolled in a special section of MATH 1508 (PreCalculus) for preengineers.
This module addresses the topic of radicals. Radicals play an important role
in the modeling of physical phenomena. Several applications of radicals in
the field of engineering are presented.

Radicals

Introduction

Equations involving radicals abound in the various fields of engineering.
Students of engineering must therefore gain confidence and competence in
solving equations that include radical expressions. In this module, several
different applications that involve the use of radicals to solve engineering
problems are presented along with several exercises.

Centripetal Force

Centripetal force is the inward directed force that is exerted on one body as
it moves in a circular path about another body.

Figure 1 illustrates a body that is in circular motion about a center point.
Centripetal force for an object under rotation.

As the object moves about the circle, its angle changes. This time rate of
change of the angle is called the angular velocity and is denoted by the
symbol . The angular velocity has units of radians/sec. As an example, if
the object makes 2 revolutions in a second, it would have an angular
velocity
Equation:

   2revolutions     2(2rad)

=                =           = 4rad/s

   s                s

Examination of Figure 1 shows the centripetal force being directed inward
toward the center of the circular path of the object. The velocity of the
object is illustrated as being in the direction of the tangent at the point on
the circle occupied by the object. If for any reason the body were released
from its orbit about the center point, it would travel in a straight line path
indicated in the direction of the velocity.

Quite often, one may measure the amount of time that it takes for the object
to complete a complete revolution and denote it as the variable (T). This
value which is usually expressed in seconds is called the period of
revolution. For the example given previously where the object makes 2
revolutions per second, the period of revolution (T) is ½ second.

The period of revolution (T) measured in seconds can be calculated by
means of a relationship that involves the magnitude of the centripetal force
(F) measured in Newtons, the mass of the object (m) measured in
kilograms, and the radius (R) of the circle measured in meters.
Equation:

                                                                                        4mR2
                                                                    T =

                                                                                               F

Question: A mass of 2 kg revolves about an axis. The radius of the object
about the axis is 0.5 m. It takes 0.25 seconds for the mass to make a single
revolution. What is the value of the centripetal force?

Solution: We begin by replacing the variables of equation (2) by their
numeric values
Equation:

                                                                                      4(2)(0.5)2
                                                            0.25 = 

                                                                                                   F

Next we take the square of each side of the equation
Equation:

                      2  4 2
                           F
(0.25) =
We can isolate F on the left hand side of the equation as
Equation:

F=                                     4 2
                                     0.625

Which leads to the result F = 632N.

                      Photograph of a high-pressure nozzle.

There are several important parameters that relate to the performance of a
nozzle. These include the diameter of the nozzle (d), the nozzle pressure (P)
and the flow rate (r). The nozzle diameter is measured in inches; the flow
rate is measured in gallons/minute; and the nozzle pressure is measured in
pounds/square inch. The relationship between these parameters can be
expressed via the radical equation
Equation:

                                                                        r = 30d2 P

Question: Water flows at a rate of 2.5 pounds/s through a nozzle whose
diameter is 0.25 inches. What is the value of the nozzle pressure at the exit?
Solution: We can begin by substituting values into equation (5).
Equation:

                                                                2.5 = 30(0.25)2 P

This can be written as
Equation:

                        P =           2.5  = 1.33
                             30(0.0625)

Squaring each side of the equation yields the result P = 1.778lb/in2

Motion of a Pendulum

A pendulum is a weight suspended from a pivot so that it can swing freely.
When a pendulum is displaced from its resting or equilibrium point, it is
subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward
the equilibrium position. When released, the restoring force combined with
the pendulum's mass causes it to swing back and forth. The time for one
complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the period. A
pendulum swings with a specific period which depends on factors such as
its length. From its discovery around 1602 by Galileo, the regular motion of
pendulums was used for timekeeping, and was the world's most accurate
timekeeping technology until the 1930s.

Figure 3 shows a picture of a pendulum.
                                  Simple pendulum.

The period of the pendulum can be represented by the variable T. The
period is typically measured in seconds. The length of the pendulum can be
modeled by the variable L and is measured in feet. Under such conditions,
the relationship between the period and the length of the pendulum is
summarized by the equation
Equation:

                                                                                                   L
                                                                        T = 2

                                                                                                  32
Question: The arm of a pendulum makes a complete cycle every two
seconds. What is the length of the pendulum?

Solution: We insert the appropriate value for the period into equation (9)
Equation:

                                                                      2 = 2L/32

Next, we square each side of the equation
Equation:

                                                                                                                            2

                                                                     4 = 4 (L/32)

which can be re-arranged as
Equation:

                               L=  32
                                   2

So our solution is L = 3.24ft

Complex Numbers
This module is part of a collection of modules that address engineering
applications of PreCalculus. The collection is intended for use by students
enrolled in a special section of MATH 1508 (PreCalculus) for preengineers
at the University of Texas at El Paso.

Complex Numbers

Introduction

It is essential that engineers master the concept of complex numbers
because the important role that complex numbers play in a variety of
application areas. In this module applications in the field of electric circuits
are provided.

Alternating Current (AC) Electric Circuits

Earlier we introduced a number of components that are typically found in
common electric circuits. These included voltage sources, current sources
and resistors. We also observed that the behavior of an electric circuit could
be predicted by using several laws from Physics, including Ohm's Law and
Kirchoff's Laws.

In this laboratory exercise, we will introduce two additional components of
electric circuits: the inductor and the capacitor. These elements are typically
found in electric circuits which involve sinusoidally varying voltage or
current sources. These circuits are called alternating current or AC circuits.
AC circuits abound in the physical world. The voltage and current that
power household appliances comes from AC sources.

Figure 1 shows the plot for a sinusoidally varying waveform that represents
the output of an AC voltage source. Such a waveform could also be used to
represent the current that is supplied by an AC current source. It is
important to note that the waveform has a repetitive or periodic nature.
Sketch of a sinusoidal waveform.

In the figure, we note that the amount of time that occurs between
successive maxima of the sinusoidal waveform is equal to the period. The
angular frequency of the waveform is denoted by the symbol  and is
defined in terms of the period by the equation
Equation:

=  2
          rad/s

    T

If we denote the amplitude as Vmax, then we can express the sinusoidal
waveform for the voltage mathematically as
Equation:

                                                          v(t) = Vmax cos(t + v )
Here the instantaneous value of the voltage is measured in the units volts.
The term v is called the phase angle of the sinusoidal waveform. It is
measured in degrees. Its usage and importance in the analysis of AC circuits
will be discussed later in the course during the study of trigonometry.
Inductors and capacitors are found in circuits of all types and designs, so
their understanding is critical to the education of an engineer or scientist.
One important distinction between resistors and these two new components
(inductors and capacitors) is that they are analyzed using different
mathematic techniques. In the case of a resistor, it was quite easy to
determine the relationship between the current, voltage and resistance
present in a circuit by means of simple algebra. In the case of the inductor
and the capacitor, we will see that we must expand our knowledge of
mathematics particulary in the are of complex numbers to analyze circuits
that contain inductors and capacitors.

Inductors
An inductor is an electrical component that stores energy in the form of a
magnetic field. In its simplest form, an inductor consistsof a wire loop or
coil. Figure 2 depicts an inductor next to a coin to show its relative size and
structure.

    Photograph of an
    inductor beside a
            coin.

The inductance of the component is directly proportional to the number of
turns present in the wire that makes up the coil. Inductance also depends on
the radius of the coil and on the type of material around which the coil is
wound. The standard unit of inductance is the Henry (H).
The schematic symbol for an inductor is shown in Figure 3.

                   Schematic symbol for an inductor.

Capacitor
A capacitor is an electrical device consisting of two conducting plates
separated by an electrical insulator (the dielectric), designed to hold an
electric charge. Charge builds up when a voltage is applied across the
plates, creating an electric field between them. Current can flow through a
capacitor only as the voltage across it is changing, not when it is constant.
Capacitors are used in power supplies, amplifiers, signal processors,
oscillators, and logic gates.
The standard unit of capacitance is the farad (F). Typical capacitance values
are small. Common capacitors have values of capacitance that are expressed
in units of microfarads (µF). Figure 4 shows a photograph of a several
different capacitors.

      values.

The standard symbol for a capacitor is shown in Figure 5.

Impedance
In the case of electric circuits that are driven by a sinusoidally varying
voltage source, the impedance serves to restrict the flow of current. Like
the resistance, impedance is measured in ohms (). However, the
impedance differs from resistance in that the impedance is a complex
quantity. Because the impedance is a complex quantity, we will represent
the impedance as a complex number
Equation:

                                                                        Z = R + jX

The real part of Z as stated in equation (3) is R and the imaginary part is X.

Resistors, inductors and capacitors serve to contribute to the impedance
present in a sinusoidally varying electric circuit. The impedance of a
resistor is merely the value of its resistance.

The impedance of an inductor (ZL) can be easily computed via the
relationship
Equation:

                                                                           ZL = jL

The impedance of an inductor is measured in the units . The term  is
equal to the angular frequency of the sinusoidally varying source voltage.
Examination of equation (4) indicates that as the angular frequency
increase, so too does the impedance of the inductor. At very high
frequencies an inductor will essentially inhibit all flow of current through
itself.

The impedance of a capacitor (Zc) is given by the equation
Equation:

          1

ZC = -j(     )

          C

The impedance of a capacitance is measured in the units . Once again, the
term  is equal to the angular frequency of the sinusoidally varying source
voltage. Examination of equation (5) indicates that as the angular frequency
increases, the impedance of the capacitor decreases. At very high
frequencies a capacitor will behave as a short circuit. That is, its effect at
very high frequencies is to allow current to flow through it in an unimpeded
manner.
Series RL Circuit
Just as resistors can be combined using series and parallel connections, so
too can impedances. In the case of series connections, impedances are
merely added. One distinction is that the addition is performed using
complex arithmetic. Let us consider the RL circuit shown in Figure 6.

                                  Series RL circuit.
The series impedance is equal to the sum of the resistance with the
impedance of the inductor. Suppose that for this circuit the value of R is 10
 and that the value for the inductance is 100 mH. Suppose that the
frequency () of the source voltage is 100 rad/sec. For this specification of
values, we can compute the impedance of the series connection
Equation:

                                                                                                                                            -3

                               Z = 10 + j(100)(100 × 10 ) = 10 + j10

The square of the magnitude of the impedance can be obtained by use of the
complex conjugate.
Equation:

                                     2

               Z  = Z × Z  (10 + j10)(10 - j10) = 100 + 100 = 200

So we calculate the magnitude of the impedance to be
Equation:

                                                                        Z = 14.17

An important property of AC circuits that contain an AC source voltage
along with resistors, inductors and capacitors is that if the current i(t) will
take the form of a sinusoid
Equation:

                                                           i(t) = Imax cos(t + i )

The instantaneous value of the current is measured in Amps. The angular
frequency of the current sinusoid () will be the same as that of the
sinusoid that represents the supply voltage. In addition, electric circuits
involving resistors, capacitors and inductors will contribute to a change in
the phase angle (i) of the current sinuosoid. In general the phase angle of
the voltage sinusoid (v) will differ from that of the current sinusoid (i).
Once again, the discussion of how the phase angle of the current can be
computed will be deferred until our later discussion of trigonometry.

Once we know the magnitude of the impedance, we can use it to calculate
the amplitude of the sinusoidally varying current, Imax. This is
accomplished by the following formula.
Equation:

Imax =  V max
        Z 

So the amplitude of the current is Vmax/141.7. It is interesting to note that
this formula is similar to Ohm's Law. The differences lie in the fact that the
magnitude of the impedance appears instead of the resistance. Also, the
amplitudes of the sinusoidally varying current and voltage appear.

The formula expressed above is useful in determining the amplitude of the
current for a wide range of sinusoidally varying AC circuits. These circuits
can combine resistors with inductors and capacitors to create a wide range
of design options for electrical engineers. The following exercises illustrate
the application of complex numbers to the analysis of AC circuits.

Logarithms
This module is part of a collection of modules intended for use by
preengineering students enrolled in MATH 108 at the University of Texas at El
Paso. This module addresses some applications of logarithms in several fields
of engineering. Examples are presented.

Logarithms

Introduction

This module is intended to present some areas of engineering in which
logarithms are used. By reading the material and solving the associated
problems, you will learn about some important applications of logarithms in
engineering.

Decibels

The decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit that indicates the ratio of a physical
quantity relative to a specified or implied reference level. The decibel is used
for a wide variety of measurements in science and engineering, most
prominently in acoustics, electronics, communications, radar, sonar and control
systems.

Decibels are frequently used as a means to express the power ratio for physical
systems. It is computed by multiplying the factor 10 by the base 10 logarithm
of the ratio of the quantities under consideration. Equation (1) shows the
computation that is used to express the ratio of two powers using decibels
Equation:

                 P2

LDB = 10log10 (      )

                 P1

Gain of an Amplifier: We will begin our discussion of decibels with an
application in the field of electronics. An amplifier is an electronic device that
is capable of boosting the power present in an input signal to produce an output
signal with more power. It can be thought of as a black box as shown in Figure
1.

Block diagram of an amplifier.

In practical cases, the ratio of the power in the output signal to the power in the
input signal is a positive quantity whose value is greater than unity. The decibel
measurement of this ratio of power is often called the gain of the amplifier and
is given as
Equation:

                                P output

Gain = 10log10 (                          )dB

                                P input

Question: An electronic signal is passed through an amplifier. Suppose that the
power present in the signal at the input to the amplifier is 10 W. The power
present in the signal at the output of the amplifier is 20 W. Express the gain of
the amplifier in decibels.

We can use equation (2) to easily express the gain of the amplifier in terms of
decibels
Equation:

(  )
                  20W

Gain = 10log10 (       ) = 10log10 (2) = 3.01dB  3dB

                  10W

Signal to Noise Ratio

Electrical signals are often corrupted by a random phenomenon known as noise
when they are transmitted from one point to another . Because it is impossible
to know the exact value of the noise at any point in time, it is often becomes
difficult to extract the orignal signal at the receiver without the application of
some form of signal processing algorithm such as a filter. The situation is
depicted in Figure 2.

Communication system with signal processing.
A common figure of merit of communication systems is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Communication systems that are characterized by high signal-to-noise
ratios are in general superior to those that are characterized by low signal-to-
noise ratios.

By definition the signal-to-noise ratio or SNR is given as the ratio of the power
in a signal divided by the power in the noise that is responsible for corrupting
the signal. The signal-to-noise ratio can be expressed in decibels as follows
Equation:

                    P signal

   SNR = 10log10 (            )dB

                    P noise

where Psignal and Pnoise represent the values for the signal power and noise
power respectively.

At the receiver, the original signal arrives with an added noise component.
Communication engineers use signal processing algorithms in the form of
filters to minimize the power of the noise that is present in the received noisy
signal while seeking to retain as much of the power of the original signal as
possible. Such algorithms are based on the premise that although random, noise
may well fall into different regions of angular frequency in the electromagnetic
spectrum than the signal itself. Thus, frequency selective filters can be utilized
to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.

Suppose that we represent the signal-to-noise ratio at the input to the signal
processing algorithm as SNRin and that at its output as SNRout. For a good
designs, SNRout will be significantly higher that that of SNRin. This increase in
signal-to-noise ratio results in superior performance and more reliable
communication of information.

Question: A signal with power 30 W is sent through a noisy communication
channel. The noise introduced by the communication channel has an associated
power of 5 W. What is the signal-to-noise ratio of the noisy signal that is
received from the communication channel in decibels?

Solution: We can find the SNR by substituting the appropriate values for the
parameters into equation (4)
Equation:

(  )  (                       )
                 P signal                 30W

SNR = 10log10 (            ) = 10log10 (       ) = 10log10 (6) = 7.78dB

                 P noise                  5W

Question: Consider the noisy signal described in Example 2. Suppose that a
signal processing filter is applied to it. The filter reduces the noise power by
95% while it reduces the signal power by only 10%. What is the signal-to-noise
ratio of the filtered output?

Solution: The amount of signal power present in the filtered output is 30 W -
0.1 (30 W) or 27 W. The amount of noise power present in the filtered output is
5 W - 0.95 (5 W) or 0.25 W.

The signal-to-noise ratio of the filtered output is
Equation:

                 27W

SNR = 10log10 (            ) = 10log10 (108) = 10  2.03 = 20.33dB

                 0.25W

We see that the primary result obtained by the application of the signal
processing filter is to raise the signal to noise ratio from 7.78 dB to 20.33 dB.
This represents an increase in SNR of 20.33 - 7.78 dB = 12.55 dB. Along with
this increase in SNR, one would observe an increase in reliable communication
of information.

Transient Response (Exponential Decay)

The transient response of a circuit is response of a circuit that is expressed as a
function of time. Determining the transient response of a circuits is important in
that knowledge of the transient response reveals how a circuit will behave
whenever perturbations arise, such as the opening or closing of a switch.

Let us examine the RC circuit present in the figure below
                                Switched RC circuit.

This circuit is called an RC circuit in that it contains a resistor and a capacitor.

The switch is open for values of time (t) less than 0. Thus for negative values of
time there is no current flow. Because there is no current flow, the voltage
across the resistor (v(t)) is zero. The capacitor is initially charged. The initial
voltage across the capacitor (V0) is 10 V.

At t =0, the switch is closed. Because the voltage across the capacitor cannot
change instantaneously, the value of the voltage across the resistor immediately
after the closing of the swith (v(0+) will be 10 V. After the switch has been
closed, current will flow throughout the circuit and the voltage across the
resistor will diminish exponentially. Because the decay can be described by the
use of an exponential function, this is an example of exponential decay.
We can write an expression for the transient response, that is, the voltage across
the resistor for positive time
Equation:

                                                                                                                                             -t/RC

                                                                        v(t) = 10e

Here, the units of v(t) are Volts.

The product of the resistance and the capacitance is called the time constant for

the circuit and is often denoted as (). The time constant is measured in

seconds. For this example,

           3  -6                               -3

 = (100 × 10 )(8 × 10 ) = 800 × 10                 = 0.800s

So the transient response of the circuit becomes

Let us now work a problem about this circuit that involves logarithms.

Question: At what instant of time will the transent response be equal to 5
Volts?

Solution: We have been asked to find the value of t that satisfies the following
equation.
Equation:

                                                                -t/0.8

                                    5 = 10e

Let us divide each side of the equation by (10) and interchange the sides
Equation:

                                       -t/0.8

                                    e          = 0.5

We now take the natural logarithm of each side
Equation:

                                    -t   = -0.693
                                    0.8

Equation:
                                                             t = (0.8)(0.693) = 0.555

So we conclude that at the time 0.555 seconds after the switch closes, the value
of the voltage across the resistor will be 5.0 volts.

Compound Interest

It is always essential to consider the financial aspects of an engineering project.
The field of industrial engineering provides us with the analytical tools
necessary to weigh the merits of competing designs.

Most situations surrounding the financial aspects of an engineering project
involve the determination of what is most economical in the long run. That is,
engineers must be aware of the costs and benefits of a project over a
considerable period of time. In situations as these, it is important to consider
the time value of money. Because of the existence of interest, the current value
of a dollar is worth more than the value of a dollar some time in the future.

Interest can be defined as money that is paid for the use of money that has
been borrowed. The rate of interest is the ratio between the interest chargeable
or payable at the end of a period of time. This period of time is typically yearly,
quarterly or monthly. In this module, we will restrict our attention to interest
that is paid yearly or per annum.

As an example, a sum of money is invested at an annual rate of interest of 4%.
One year later, the interest that would be paid on the investment would be $40
(4% of $1,000). So after one year, the initial sum would grow to a value of
$1,040 one year later.

Suppose that the $1,040 were invested for a second year at the end of the first
year. At the end of the second year, the amount of interest that would be
payable would be 4% of $1,040 or $41.60. The amount of interest earned in the
second year exceeds the amount earned in the first year because of a
phenomenon known as compound interest.

Interest calculations can be quantified by mathematical formulas. Suppose that
we are concerned with making an investment of P dollars at an annual rate of
interest of i for n years. Here P denotes the present value of the investment, n
represents the number of years the money is to be invested, and i is the interest
rate per annum. Let us denote by F the future value of the investment at the end
of n years. The value of F can be calculated via the formula
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                          n

                                                                          F = P (1 + i)

Let us illustrate the use of this formula by means of a problem.

Question: A couple has just had a baby. The couple wishes to make an
investment in an account that will be used to fund college expenses. The couple
visits an investment advisor and establishes a tax-free college savings account.
By tax-free, we mean an account where income tax is not paid yearly. The
couple is advised that this feature will enable the account to grow faster.

The couple deposits $25,000 in the account. The couple is told that the value of
the account will appreciate at an annual rate of 8% . What will be the value of
the account when the child turns 18 years of age?

Solution: We are asked to find the value of F. From the problem statement, P is
$25,000, i is 0.08 and n is 18. We substitute into the interest formula to obtain
the result
Equation:

18  18
F = (25,000)(1 + 0.08) = (25,000)(1.08) = (25,000)(3.996) = 99,900

We conclude that the account will be worth $99,900 at the end of 18 years.

Let us now a related problem that involves the use of logarithms.

Question: An individual inherits $10,000 from a relative. The individual wishes
to invest the sum in a tax-free account. He/she plans to use the proceeds of this
account as a down payment on a future purchase of a home. The annual interest
rate of the account is 6%,

The individual anticipates that he/she will need at least $20,000 for the down
payment. How long will it take for the value of the account to grow to $20,000?
Solution: Once again, we begin with the identification of the parameters of the
problem. Here, P is 10,000, i is 0.06, and F is 20,000. We incorporate these
values into the interest formula
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                     n

                                                       20,000 = (10,000)(1 + 0.06)

Let us divide each side by (10,000) and re-arrange terms
Equation:

                                                                                                                                     n

                                                                              (1.06) = 2

Now let us take the logarithm of each side of the equation. We will use 1.06 as
the base of the logarithm
Equation:

                                                                           n = log1.06 (2)

The base 1.06 logarithm is related to the base 10 logarithm as follows
Equation:

    log1.06 (x) =     log10 (x)
                   log10 (1.06)

We will use this relationship to help us find the value for n
Equation:

    log10 (2)        0.301

n=                =          = 11.90

    log10 (1.06)     0.0253

So the individual should plan on waiting 11.90 years for the account to grow to
a value of $20,000.

Problems such as the previous one often make use of the relationship
Equation:
loga (x) =  logb (x)
            logb (a)

This relationship allows one to convert from the logarithm of any base to a
logarithm of another base. Typically, scientific calculators are only able to
compute base 10 and natural (base e) logarithms. One should become
acquainted with the conversion of logarithms of other bases to base 10 or base
e logarithms.

Simultaneous Equations
This module is part of a collection of modules intended for preengineering
students enrolled in MATH 1508 (PreCalculus) at the University of Texas at
El Paso.

Simultaneous Equations

Introduction

The applications of simultaneous equations in the modeling, analysis and
design of engineering systems are numerous. This module presents several
applications drawn from engineering that illustrate uses of simultaneous
equations.

Unmanned Air Vehicle (Robotics)

Many applications in engineering involve the quantities speed, distance and
time. In some applications, one is presented with two situations. In the two
situations, the speed of an object differs. The following is an example
involving an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) whose speed varies depending
upon whether the UAV travels in the same direction of the wind as opposed
to the situation where the UAV travels in the opposite direction in
opposition to the wind. Simultaneous equations can be used to solve
problems relating to situations such as this.

Example 1: In a closed course surveillance flight, the downwind leg of
length18.6 miles is completed in 2.0 hours. The upwind leg which is also
18.6 miles in length is completed in 3.5 hours. Find both the speed of the
UAV and the speed of the wind.

To address such a problem it is critical to begin with the definition of
variables. We will let V be the airspeed of the UAV measured in miles/hr.
The wind speed expressed in miles/hr will be represented by the variable
W.
We know that the distance that an object travels is equal the product of its
speed and time. When the UAV travels downwind, its speed will be equal to
the sum of its airspeed and the windspeed. When the UAV travels upwind,
its total speed will equal to the difference of its airspeed minus the
windspeed. The distance that the UAV travels is the same (18.6 miles)
whether it travels downwind or upwind.
We can use this information to establish two equations
Equation:

                                                            18.6 = 2.0 × (V + W )

Equation:

                                                            18.6 = 3.5 × (V - W )

From equation (1) we obtain
Equation:

                                                            18.6 = 2.0 × (V + W )

which can can yield an expression for the variable V
Equation:

                                                                       V = 9.3 - W

Next, we can substitute this expression for V into equation (2). By doing so,
we will be able to solve for W.
Equation:

                                                 18.6 = 3.5 × ((9.3 - W ) - W )

Dividing each side of the equation by (3.5) yields
Equation:

                                                           5.31 = (9.3 - W ) - W
This equation can be readily solved for the variable W as follows
Equation:

                                                                      -3.99 = -2W
                                                               W = 1.995miles/hr

Next, we substitute this value for W into equation (4) to solve for V.
Equation:

                                              V = 9.3 - 1.995 = 7.305miles/hr

Thus we conclude that the UAV airspeed is 7.305 miles/hr and the
windspeed is 1.995 miles/hr.

Analysis of a Torsion Beam
Torque is a term that is used to describe the tendency of a force to rotate an
object about an axis, a fulcrum or a pivot. Just as a force is a push or a pull,
a torque can be thought of as a twist. Loosely speaking, torque is a measure
of the turning force on an object such as a bolt. For example, pushing or
pulling the handle of a wrench connected to a nut or bolt produces a torque
(turning force) that loosens or tightens the nut or bolt.
Consider the torsion beam shown in Figure 1.
            Diagram of a torsion beam.

Figure 1. Torsion beam.

In this figure, we observe a situation in which forces are applied at each end
of the beam. We also note that each force is applied at a right angle to the
beam. Under such conditions, torque can be calculated as the product of the
force and the length of the beam from its end to its support point atop the
pivot point of the beam.

The force (F1) contributes a counter-clockwise torque (TCCW) on the
beam. The value of this torque can be calculated
Equation:

                                                                   TCCW = F1 × R1

The force (F2) contributes a clockwise torque (TCW) on the beam. The
value of this torque can be calculated as
Equation:

                                                                    TCW = F2 × R2
Suppose that the beam is not in motion. Engineers would say that the beam
is static or that the beam system is in equillibrium. A necessary condition
for equillibrium of the system is that the two torques be equal, that is
Equation:

                                                                       TCW = TCCW

We now will apply what we know about simultaneous equations to solve a
problem involving a torsion beam.

Example 2: Assume that a a beam of length 56 inches is supported by a
fulcrum. Force is applied at each end of the beam. Assume that the force
(F1) on the left hand side of the beam is 24 lbs while the force on the right
hand side of the beam (F2) is 32 lbs. If the beam is static, then what are the
values of R1 and R2?

We know from that the clockwise and counter-clockwise torques must
balance as a condition for equilibrium. This leads to the first equation that
we will use to solve this problem
Equation:

                                                                       24R1 = 32R2

which can be written as
Equation:

                         24R1 - 32R2 = 0

We also know that the overall length of the beam is 56 inches. Therefore,
Equation:

                                                                      R1 + R2 = 56

which can be solved for R1 as
Equation:
                             R1 = 56 - R2

We may substitute the expression for R1 in equation () to obtain
Equation:

                                                         24(56 - R2 ) - 32R2 = 0

Multiplication and rearrangement yield the equation
Equation:

                                                                       1,344 = 56R2

which can be solved for R2.
Equation:

                             R2 = 24in

The value for R1 can be easily found as
Equation:

                                          R1 = 56 - R2 = 56 - 24 = 32inches

Parallel Processing

Parallel processing is a term drawn from Compute Science that involves the
simultaneous use of more than one central processing unit (CPU) to execute
a program. Ideally, parallel processing makes programs run faster because
there are more than one processors in use to execute the program. Though
most computers have just one CPU, newer computer architectures that
feature several CPU's are becoming the norm more prevalent.

Example 3: Suppose that we are interested in implementing a computer
algorithm on two processors. Let us call these processors A and B. The
steps involved in the accomplishment of the algorithm are divided among
the two processors. In all there are 17,000,000 computations which will
need to be performed on the two processors. Working in parallel, the two
processors accomplish the algorithm. In doing so, the processor A is in
service for 3 seconds while the processor B is in services for 2 seconds.

Suppose that a second algorithm is to be accomplished by processors A and
B working in parallel. In all, the second algorithm requires the execution of
15,500,000 computations. In executing the second algorithm, 2 seconds of
computing time are required of processor A while 3 seconds of computing
time are required of processor B.

What are the processor rates for processor A and processor B?

Suppose that we define the processing rates (measured in
computations/second) for processors A and B to be represented by the
variables x and y respectively. With this definition of variables, the number
of computations that processor A can perform in 3 seconds is the product (3
x). Likewise the number of computations that processor B can perform in 2
seconds is the product (2 y). The total number of computations that must be
performed to complete the first algorithm is 17,000,000. Therefore, we
obtain the first of two simultaneous equations
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                             6

                                                               3x + 2y = 17 × 10

Let us now consider the implementation of the second algorithm. The
number of computations that processor A can make in 2 seconds is equal to
the product (2 x). Similarly, the number of computations that processor B
can make in 3 seconds is the product (3 y). We obtain the second
simultaneous equation as
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                 6

                                                             2x + 3y = 15.5 × 10

Let us use the first equation to solve for x in terms of y
Equation:

                                                                                        6

              3x = -2y + 17 × 10

which results in the expression
Equation:

              x=                                            6

                                 17 × 10 - 2y

                                                 3

Next, we substitute this expression for x into equation ()
Equation:

                                                   6                                                                 6

                    17 × 10 - 2y                      + 3y = 15.5 × 10

           2

                                    3

This equation can be simplified as follows
Equation:

           6                     3                    3                                                            6

           17 × 10 - 2y + (3y) =                                                 15.5 × 10

                                 2                    2

Equation:

              6                                                                                                         6

           17 × 10 - 2y + 4.5y = 23.25 × 10

Equation:

                                                                              6

                 2.5y = 6.25 × 10

This leads to the solution
Equation:

                                                                                                                     6

                                                  y = 2.5 × 10 computations/s
We now may solve for x through the use of equation ()
Equation:

                              6                                                                6

                          17 × 10 - 2(2.5 × 10 )

x=

                                                            3

which lead to the result
Equation:

                          x=                             6                                  6

                              12 × 10                       = 4 × 10

                                       3

Thus we conclude that processor A can perform 4 million computations per
second while processor B can perform 2.5 million computations per second.

Alloy Compositions

Metallurgical engineering involves the study of the physical and chemical
behavior of metallic elements and their mixtures, which are called alloys. It
is also involves the technology of metals. That is, metallurgical engineering
encompasses the way in which the science of metals is applied to produce
compounds for practical use.

The following example presents how simultaneous equations can be applied
in the study of alloys.

Example 4: Let us consider two alloys comprised of different percentages
of copper and zinco. Suppose that the first alloy is made up of a mixture of
70% copper and 30% zinc. The second alloy is comprised of 40% copper
and 60% zinc.

By melting the two alloys and re-combining their constituents into one 300
gram casting, the resulting alloy is 60% copper and 40% zinc.
Find the amount of copper and zinc in each of the original alloys.

We begin our solution by establishing the variables A and B as being equal
to the mass (in grams) of the first alloy and the second alloy respectively.
We know that the final casting has a mass of 300 grams, so our first
simultaneous equation is
Equation:

                                                                        A + B = 300

Because 60% of the final casting is copper, the amount of copper in the
final casting is the product 0.60 (300 grams) or 180 grams.

We know that 70% of the first alloy is copper and that 40% of the second
alloy is copper. Thus we may write the second simultaneous equation as
Equation:

                                                                0.7A + 0.4B = 180

The variable A can be expressed as (300 - B) and substituted into the
equation
Equation:

                                                                0.7A + 0.4B = 180

to yield
Equation:

           0.7(300 - B) + 0.4B = 180

This equation can be simplified as
Equation:

                                                            210 - 0.7B + B = 180
Combining terms yields
Equation:

                        -0.3B = -30

The solution for the variable B is 100. So we find that the mass of the
second alloy is 100 grams. Because the sum of the masses of the two alloys
is 300 grams, the mass of the first allow is 200 grams.

Photovoltaic Arrays

A photovoltaic system is a system which uses one or more solar panels to
convert sunlight into electricity. It consists of multiple components,
including the photovoltaic modules, mechanical and electrical connections
and mountings and means of regulating and/or modifying the electrical
output.

Due to the low voltage of an individual solar cell (typically on the order of
0.5V), several cells are wired in series in the manufacture of a "laminate".
The laminate is assembled into a protective weatherproof enclosure, thus
making a photovoltaic module or solar panel. Modules may then be strung
together into a photovoltaic array. The electricity generated can be either
stored, used directly (island/standalone plant)or fed into a large electricity
grid powered by central generation plants (grid-connected/grid-tied plant)
or combined with one or many domestic electricity generators to feed into a
small grid (hybrid plant)

A photovoltaic array (or solar array) is a linked collection of solar panels.
The power that one module can produce is seldom enough to meet
requirements of a home or a business, so the modules are linked together to
form an array. Most arrays use a device known as an inverter to convert the
DC power produced by the modules into alternating current that can be
used to power lights, household appliances, motors, and other loads. The
modules in a photovoltaic array are usually first connected in series to
obtain the desired voltage. Once this is accomplished, the individual strings
are then connected in parallel to allow the system to produce more current.
Example 6: A photvoltaic array is to be installed. It is a requirement that the
length of the array be 8 inches longer than its width. A second requirement
states that the total area of the array be 180 in2.

Find the length (L) and width (W) of the array.

We may use the first requirement to construct the first simultaneous
equation
Equation:

                                                                          L = W +8

The second requirement contributes a second simultaneous equation
Equation:

                                                                           LW = 180

We may substitute the expression for L given by equation (18) into equation
(19)
Equation:

                                                                                                         2

                                                                   W + 8W = 180

or equivalently
Equation:

                          2

                 W + 8W - 180 = 0

This quadratic equation can be factored as
Equation:

                                                          (W + 18)(W - 10) = 0

The two roots for W are 10 in and -18 in. Because it is physically
impossible to have a negative value for width, we ignore the second root
and conclude that the width of the photovoltaic array is 10 in. We use this
value to solve for the length (L) of the array
Equation:

                                                  L = W + 8 = 10 + 8in = 18in

Therefore, the dimensions of the photovoltaic array are 18 x 10 in.

Cramer's Rule

Cramer's Rule

Introduction

Cramer's Rule is a technique that can be used to solve simultaneous linear
equations. It is most often utilized when one is required to solve the system
by hand rather than by computer. This is due to the fact that there are
quicker, more efficient procedures such as Gauss elimination that can be
implemented on the computer. The approach is based upon the use of
determinants.

Mathematical Preliminaries

Before we describe the procedure known as Cramer's Rule, we begin with
some mathematical preliminaries. Let us consider a pair of two
simultaneous linear equations in two unknowns (x1 and x2). We can write
these equations as
Equation:

                                                                a11 x1 + a12 x2 = b1

and
Equation:

           a21 x1 + a22 xx = b2

Here the coefficients a11, a12, a21, and a22 are known constants.

Now, let us solve this system of equations via Gauss elimination. We should
recall that the basic idea behind Gauss elimination is to reduce the original
set of equations into an equivalent form which is triangular and to use back-
substitution once the first unknown is discovered.
We begin by multiplying each side of equation (1) by the value (-a21/a11).
This yields an equivalent equation of the form

Equation:

                a21 a12           a 21

-a21 x1 -                x2 = -         b1

                 a 11             a 11

Next, we add equation (3) to equation (2). In doing so, we note that the term

involving x1 is removed. The result of the addition of the two equations is
Equation:

        a21 a12                    a 21

(a22 -           )x2 = b2 - (            )b1

        a 11                       a 11

The value for the unknown x2 can be easily found using equation (4). The
solution is

Equation:

        x2 =      a11 b2 - a21 b1
                a11 a22 - a12 a21

This result can be substituted back into equation (1) to produce an equation

that can be solved for the unknown x1.
Equation:

                 a11 b2 - a21 b1

a11 x1 + a12 (                     ) = b1

                a11 a22 - a12 a21

The solution for the unknown, x1, proceeds as follows. The equation ( ) tells
us

Equation:

                         a11 b2 - a21 b1

a11 x1 = b1 - a12 (                         )

                       a11 a22 - a12 a21
which can be expressed as
Equation:

a11 x1 =  a11 a22 b1 - a12 a21 b1 - a11 a12 b2 + a12 a21 b1
                                           a11 a22 - a12 a21

This can be reduced to the following equation
Equation:

          a11 x1 =         a11 a22 b1 - a11 a12 b2
                                a11 a22 - a12 a21

Dividing through by the constant a11 yields an expression for x1.
Equation:

          x1 =               a22 b1 - a12 b2
                           a11 a22 - a12 a21

Equations (5) and (10) provide us the solution for the variables in terms of
the set of constants associated with the original equations. Examination of
equations (5) and (10) reveals that the solution for each variable includes
the common term
Equation:

                                                               = a11 a22 - a12 a21

Suppose we write our original equations in matrix-vector form as follows
Equation:

                           x1              b1

                           A[ ] = [ ]

                           x2              b2

where we define the coefficient matrix as
Equation:

                          a 1,1  a 1,2
           A=[                            ]

                          a 2,1  a 2,2

Clearly, we see that the term  is equal to the determinant of the coefficient
matrix
Equation:

                                                                 = det(A) = A 

Next let us consider the numerator for the solution of the unknown x1 as
expressed in equation (10). We recognize that it, too, can be expressed by
means of a determinant as is shown below
Equation:

                                                                                 b1  a 1,2
                                                                                              ]
           x1 = a2,2 b1 - a1,2 b2 = det[
                                                                                 b2  a 2,2

We note that the matrix in the equation can be obtained by merely replacing
the first column of the original coefficient matrix with the vector
Equation:

                                                                                            b1
                                                                            B=[ ]

                                                                                            b2

So the solution for the unknown x1 can be written as a ratio of determinants
Equation:

                            b1     a 1,2
                 det[                       ]

                            b2     a 2,2

           x1 =

                                 
Before we solve for the variable x2, we replace the second column of the
original coefficient matrix with the vector B. With this replacement
accomplished, we may write the solution for the unknown x2 as a ratio of
determinants
Equation:

                                       a 1,1  b1
                            det[                   ]

                                       a 2,1  b2

           x2 =                           

In the following section, we will outline a procedure that can be used to
solve simultaneous linear equations based upon determinants which is
called solution via Cramer's Rule.

Solution via Cramer's Rule

It is important that one begin by writing the set of simultaneous equations in
normal form. That is, the equations should be written as
Equation:

           a11 x1 + a12 x2 = b1

Equation:

           a21 x1 + a22 xx = b2

Next, we form the coefficient matrix
Equation:

                          a 1,1       a 1,2
           A=[                                 ]

                          a 2,1       a 2,s

At this point, we can solve for the value of  by taking the determinant of
A.
In anticipation of solving for the unknown x1, we replace the first column of
A with the elements contained in the column vector
Equation:

                                                                                            b1
                                                                            B=[ ]

                                                                                            b2

Once this is accomplished we can express the solution for x1 as the ratio
Equation:

                 b1     a 1,2
      det[                       ]

                 b2     a 2,2

x1 =

      

To obtain the solution for the unknown x2, we return to the original
coefficient matrix A. This time, we replace the second column of A with the

column vector B. Now, we can solve for x2 as a ratio
Equation:

                 a 1,1  b1
      det[                   ]

                 a 2,1  b2

x2 =                

This constitutes the procedure for solving a system of two linear equations
in two unknowns via Cramer's Rule.

Example: Mesh Current Analysis

Mesh current analysis is one of the techniques that are often employed to
analyze an electric circuit that contains more than one mesh or loop. Figure
1 provides an example of an electric circuit containing two meshs.
 Electric circuit with two
independent mesh currents.

The mesh currents are identified as I1 and I2. The set of equations that
govern the behavior of the circuit in terms of the mesh currents are
Equation:

                                                       (R1 + R3 )I1 + R3 I1 = V1

Equation:

                                                          R3 I1 + (R2 + R3 ) = V2

Suppose that the values for R1, R2 and R3 are 2 , 3, and 1  respectively.
Also, suppose that values for V1 and V2 are 6 V and 9 V. With these values
defined, the set of equations can be written as
Equation:

                                                                        3I1 + I2 = 6

and
Equation:

           I1 + 4I2 = 9
We can use Cramer's Rule to find the mesh currents. We begin by finding
the value for 
Equation:

                        3              1
 = det[                                   ] = 12 - 1 = 11

                        1              4

Next, we find the value for I1.
Equation:

                 6               1
      det[
                                    ]
                 9
                                 4        24 - 9
                
I1 =                                   =          = 1.364A

                                          11

By a similar approach, we solve for I2.
Equation:

                 3               6
      det[
                                    ]
                 1
                                 9        27 - 6
                
I2 =                                   =          = 1.909A

                                          11

Summary

This module has presented Cramer's Rule as a technique for solving
simultaneous linear equations. The discussion in this module was limited to
systems involving two simultaneous equations. This limitation was
deliberate in that Cramer's Rule is typically not applied for linear systems
comprised of large numbers of equations. An application involving the
mesh analysis of an electric circuit was provided.

3. Two types of pumps provide input into a municipal reservoir. Let us
  refer to the two types of pumps as A and B. If 4 type A and 2 type B

  gallons/min. If 3 type A and 5 type B pumps operate at maximum flow,
  the input to the reservoir is 1,600 gallons/min. Find the flow rates for
  type A and type B pumps using Cramer's Rule.

  memory chips is $7,200. The combined cost of 8 microprocessors and
  42 random access memory chips is $6,600. Find the cost of each
  microprocessor chip and each random access memory chip using
  Cramer's Rule.

5. The design of an electronic thermometer is based in part upon the
  incorporation of a component known as a thermistor. A thermistor has
  the property that its resistance varies linearly as a function of
  temperature. This linear relationship is R = R0 + mT . The term (R0)
  represents the value of the resistance at 00 C. At a temperature T = 250
  C, the resistance of the thermistor (R) is 100 . A a temperature of 550
  C, the resistance of the thermistor is 104 . Use Cramer's Rule to find
  the values for R0 and m.

Solution of an Electric Circuit with 2 Unknowns by Matrix Inversion
Let us apply our knowledge of matrices to assist us in the analysis of an
electric circuit. We consider the circuit shown below.

               Electric circuit with two node voltages specified.
In this example, we wish to solve for the two node voltages v1 and v2. Since
there are two unknowns in this problem, we must first establish two
independent equations that reflect the operation of the circuit.

Kirchoff's Current Law tells us that the sum of the currents that enter a
node must equal the sum of the currents that leave a node. Let us focus first
on node 1. The current that enters node 1 from the left can be stated
mathematically as
Equation:

                                                                             10V - v1

                                                                                     1

The current that enters node 1 from the right can be stated as
Equation:

                                                                               v2 - v1
                                                                                     1

The current that travels downward from node 1 is
Equation:

                                                                                      v1
                                                                                     2

We can arrange the expressions for each of the currents in terms of an
equation via Kirchoff's Current Law
Equation:

10V - v1     v2 - v1                                                                      v1

          +           =

1            1                                                                            2

We can combine and rearrange these terms into the equation
Equation:

                                                                   5v1 - 2v2 = 20V
Now let us turn our attention to node 2. The current entering node 2 from
the left is given by the expression
Equation:

                                                                               v1 - v2
                                                                                     1

The current entering node 2 from the right is 2 A. The current leaving node
2 in a downward direction is
Equation:

                                                                                      v2

                                                                                     4

We proceed to combine these currents via Kirchoff's Current Law
Equation:

           v1 - v2  + 2A =  v2
                1           4

This equation can be rearranged as
Equation:

                                                                -4v1 + 5v2 = -8V

So the pair of equations that we will use to solve for the two unknowns are
Equation:

                                                                   5v1 - 2v2 = 20V

and
Equation:

           -4v1 + 5v2 = -8V
These equations may be expressed in matrix-vector form as
Equation:

                5  -2 v1                          20
           [
                      ][ ] = [                        ]
              -4
                   5   v2                      -8

or                 v1                   20
Equation:
                   A[ ] = [                 ]
Equation:
                   v2                   -8

                                     5  -2
                   A=[                         ]

                                  -4      5

Let us find the inverse of the matrix A. The coefficients of this matrix are
given by
Equation:

                                                                              a1,1 = 5

Equation:

                                                                            a1,2 = -2

Equation:

                                                                            a2,1 = -4

Equation:

                                                                              a2,2 = 5
The inverse can be found making use of the following formula
Equation:

                         -1          1      a 2,2  -a 1,2
                                                                ]
A                            =           [
                                                     a 1,1
                                 detA -a2,1

It should be noted that this formula works only with (2 x 2) matrices. For
matrices of higher rank, other methods need to be applied.

For this example, the determinant of A is found as
Equation:

                                   detA = (5)(5) - (-4)(-2) = 25 - 8 = 17

We can incorporate this information to express the inverse matrix as
Equation:

                                 -1       15       2
                                                [     ]
                             A       =
                                         17 4      5

which can be written as
Equation:

                                            5       2

                                 -1         17     17

                             A       =[                 ]

                                            4       5

                                            17     17

We can apply A-1 to solve for the unknowns
Equation:

                             -1      v1                  20

                                                -1

                         A A[ ] = A [                        ]

                                     v2            -8

Recognizing that A-1A = I, we find that
Equation:

v1                  20       15       2 20                                                1 84   4.94
                                   [
           -1
                            17 4
[ ]=A [                 ]=            ][                                              ]=  [ ]=[        ]

v2         -8                         5 -8                                                17 40  2.35

So the node voltages are given as
Equation:

                                                                          v1 = 4.94V

and
Equation:

                            v2 = 2.35V

Solution of an Electric Circuit with 3 Unknowns by Gaussian
Elimination

Let us consider the electric circuit that is shown below.
           Electric circuit with three unknown currents.

Suppose that we are interested in determining the value of the three

unknown currents I1, I2 and I3. In order to do so, we rely upon Ohm's Law
and Kirchoff's Laws to develop a system of three independent, linear

equations. We should note that because we have three unknowns (I1, I2 and
I3), we must have three independent, linear equations.
Equation:

           I1 + I2 + I3 = 0

Equation:

           -2I1 + 3I2 = 24
 Equation:-3I2 + 6I3 = 0

      1  11
                      

Let us define the matrix A = -2 3 0

 0 -3 6

In order to find the unknowns, we must first find the inverse of the matrix

A. This can be accomplished using elimination. To start the process, we
adjoin the vector [0 24 0]T to the matrix A.

Equation:

1        1 10

(-2 3 024)

0 -3 6 0

Next, we wish to force the left-most constant of row 2 to take on a value of
0. We can do so by multiplying each value in the first row by (-2) and
subtracting the result from the corresponding value in row 2. This process
yields
Equation:

                                                                          1 1 10

                                                                       (0 5 224)

                                                                          0 -3 6 0

Now, we divide each term in row 2 by (5) to yield
Equation:

11       1                           0

(0 1 2/524/5)

0 -3     6                           0
 Next,weturnourattentiontoeliminatingthe(-3)terminrow3.Wecando1110

so by multiplying each term of row 2 by (-3) and subtracting the results0 1 2/5 24/5
from the corresponding terms in row 3. This produces the matrix
Equation:                  0 0 36/572/5        

We can then divide the terms of row 3 by (36/5) to produce
Equation:

                           11  1  0

                         (0 1 2/524/5)

                           00  1  2

Interpretation of the third row tells us that the value for the third unknown

(I3) is 2 A. We can use the coefficients from the second row along with the
value for I3 to solve for I2.
Equation:

                         I2 +  2            24
                                             5
                                   (I3 ) =
                               5

which yields the result
Equation:

                               I2 = 4A.

Lastly, we may use the coefficients of the first row along with the
previously determined values for I2 and I3 to produce the result for I1.

I1 + I2 + I3 = 0
Insertion of the previously found unknowns yields
Equation:

                                                                      I1 + 4 + 2 = 0

So we find the value for I1 to be -6 A.

Trigonometry

Trigonometry

Introduction

Trigonometry is a very important tool for engineers. This reading mentions
just a few of the many applications that involve trigonometry to solve
engineering problems.

Trigonometry means the study of the triangle. Most often, it refers to
finding angles of a triangle when the lengths of the sides are known, or
finding the lengths of two sides when the angles and one of the side lengths
are known.

As you complete this reading, be sure to pay special attention to the variety
of areas in which engineers utilize trigonometry to develop the solutions to
problems. Rest assured that there are an untold number of applications of
trigonometry in engineering. This reading only introduces you to a few. You
will learn many more as you progress through your engineering studies.

Virtually all engineers use trigonometry in their work on a regular basis.
Things like the generation of electrical current or a computer use angles in
ways that are difficult to see directly, but that rely on the fundamental rules
of trigonometry to work properly. Any time angles appear in a problem, the
use of trigonometry usually will not be far behind.

An excellent working knowledge of trigonometry is essential for practicing
engineers. Many problems can be easily solved by applying the
fundamental definitions of trigonometric functions. Figure 1 depicts a right
triangle for which we will express the various trigonometric functions and
relationships that are important to engineers.
               Triangle for definition of trigonometric functions.
Some of the most widely used trigonometric functions follow

Equation:
The Pythagorean Theorem often plays a key role in applications involving
trigonometry in engineering. It states that the square of the hypotenuse is
equal to the sum of the squares of the adjacent side and of the opposite side.
This theorem can be stated mathematically by means of the equation that
follows. Here we make use of the symbols (A, B, and C) that designate
associated lengths.
Equation:

In the remainder of this module, we will make use of these formulas in
addressing various applications.

Flight Path of an Aircraft

The following is representative of the type of problem one is likely to
encounter in the introductory Physics course as well as in courses in
Mechanical Engineering. This represents an example of how trigonometry
can be applied to determine the motion of an aircraft.

Assume that an airplane climbs at a constant angle of 30 from its departure
point situated at sea level. It continues to climb at this angle until it reaches
its cruise altitude. Suppose that its cruise altitude is 31,680 ft above sea
level.

With the information stated above, we may sketch an illustration of the
situation
                            Depiction of aircraft motion.

Question 1: What is the distance traveled by the plane from its departure
point to its cruise altitude?

The distance traveled by the plane is equal to the length of the hypotenuse
of the right triangle depicted in Figure 2. Let us denote the distance
measured in feet that the plane travels by the symbol C. We may apply the
definition of the sine function to enable us to solve for the symbol C as
follows.
Equation:
Rearranging terms we find
Equation:

Calculation and rounding to 3 significant digits yields the result
Equation:

Let us ponder a second question based upon the data presented in the
original problem.
Question 2: What is the ground distance traveled by the airplane as it
moves from its departure point to its cruise altitude?
Solution: Referring to Figure 2, we observe that we must find the length of
the adjacent side in order to answer the question. We can use the definition
of the tangent to guide our solution.
Equation:

Denoting the adjacent side by the symbol A, we obtain
Equation:

Equation:
After rounding to 3 significant digits, we obtain the solution
Equation:

Inclined Plane
Work is an important concept in virtually every field of science and
engineering. It takes work to move an object; it takes work to move an
electron through an electric field; it takes work to overcome the force of
gravity; etc.
Let's consider the case where we use an inclined plane to assist in the
raising of a 300 pound weight. The inclined plane situated such that one end
rests on the ground and the other end rests upon a surface 4 feet aove the
ground. This situation is depicted in Figure 3.
                            Object on an inclined plane.

Question 3: Suppose that the length of the inclined plane is 12 feet. What is
the angle that the plane makes with the ground?
Clearly, the length of the inclined plane is same as that of the hypotenuse
shown in the figure. Thus, we may use the sine function to solve for the
angle
Equation:
In order to solve for the angle, we must make use of the inverse sine
function as shown below
Equation:

Equation:

So we conclude that the inclined plane makes a 19.850 angle with the
ground.

Neglecting any effects of friction, we wish to determine the amount of work
that is expended in moving the block a distance (L) along the surface of the
inclined plane.

Surveying

Let us now turn our attention to an example in the field of surveying. In
particular, we will investigate how trigonometry can be used to help forest
rangers combat fires. Let us suppose that a fire guard observes a fire due
south of her Hilltop Lookout location. A second fire guard is on duty at a
Watch Tower that is located 11 miles due east of the Hilltop Lookout
location. This second guard spots the same fire and measures the bearing
(angle) at 2150 from North. The figure below illustrates the geometry of the
situation.
             Depiction of a scenario associated with a forest fire.

Refraction

Refraction is a physical phenomenon that occurs when light passes from

one transparent medium (such as air) through another (for example, glass.)

It is known that light travels at different speeds through different

transparent media. The index of refraction of a medium is a measure of how

much the speed of light is reduced as it passes through the medium. In the

case of glass, the index of refraction is approximately 1.5. This means that

light travels as a speed of  times the speed of light in a vacuum.

Two common properties of transparent materials can be attributed to the
index of refraction. One is that light rays change direction as they pass from
one medium through another. Secondly, light is partially reflected when it
passes from one medium to another medium with a different index of
refraction. We will focus on the first of these properties in this reading.

In optics, which is a field of physics, you will learn about Snell's law,
which is also known as Descartes' law after the scientist, Rene Descartes.
Snell's law takes the form of an equation that states the relationship
between the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction for light passing
from one medium to another. Stated mathematically, Snell's law is
Equation:

It follows that
Equation:
where          are the Index of Refraction of medium 1 and medium 2

respectively.

Consider a situation where light rays pass are shined from air through a tank
of water. This situation is illustrated below.

                 Depiction of light refraction.

The Index of refraction for air is 1.0003 and that of water is 1.3000. Let us
assume that the angle that light enters the water is 210 40', what is the angle
of refraction, w?
From Snell's law, we know
Equation:
Equation:

Substituting in the numerical values for IA, IW and a yield
Equation:

We now make use of the inverse sine function
Equation:

This leads to the result
Equation:

We conclude that the refracted ray will travel through the water at an angle
of refraction of 160 30'.

Determining the Speed of an Airplane Relative to a Stationary Observer

On occasion objects move within a medium that is itself in motion with respect to an
observer. For example, an airplane usually encounters a wind as it flies. The speed of the
airplane with respect to a stationary observer situated on the ground will not be the same
as the speedometer reading for the plane. In order to calculate the true speed of the plane,
it is essential to include the effect due to the wind. In some cases, planes encounter
headwinds which will diminish the speed of the plane relative to a stationary observer. I
other cases, planes may encounter tail winds which will increase the speed relative to a
stationary observer.

Question 1: Let us consider the example where an airplane is traveling with a speed of
880 km/hr with respect to the air. Suppose the airplane encounters a tailwind of velocity
30 km/hr. What is the resultant velocity of the airplane relative to an observer on the
ground?

This problem can be addressed using the concept of vector addition. We will represent the
velocity of the plane relative to the air as the vector V1 and that of the tail wind as the
vector V2. The velocity of the plane relative to a stationary observer on the ground can be
found by performing the vector addition of V1 and V2. This addition is accomplished by
placing the tail of vector V2 to the head of vector V1. The result, 910 km/m, is shown in
Figure 1 (a).
                                Combining velocities.

Let us now consider a different situation.

Question 2: Consider the same airplane as in Question 1. However, assume that the
airplane is encountering a head wind of 30 km/hr. What is the speed of the plane relative
to a stationary observer on the ground?

In this case, the head wind serves to slow the airplane. The situation is reflected in Figure
1 (b). We note that the vector V2 is directed opposite to that of vector V1 due to the fact
that the head wind opposes the motion of the airplane. The resulting speed relative to an
observer on the ground is computed as 850 km/hr.

Now, we will consider a situation in which we must use our knowledge of vectors and
trigonometry to find the correct result.

Question 3: Consider the same airplane as in Question 1. However, assume that the
airplane is encountering a cross wind of 30 km/hr. What is the speed of the plane relative
to a stationary observer on the ground?

This situation is depicted in Figure 2.
           Adding orthogonal velocities.

In this case, the speed of the airplane is represented by the length of the sum of vectors,
V1 + V2. Using the x-y coordinate system shown in the figure, we note that
Equation:

                                                                                           V1 = 880x ^

and
Equation:

           V2 = 30y^

we may write an expression for this sum in vector form as
Equation:

                                                                            V1 + V2 = 880x ^ + 30y^
To determine the speed of the airplane relative to a stationary observer we must find the
magnitude of the vector sum. We can do so by applying the Pythagorean Theorem
Equation:

                                             2  2

 V1 + V2 =    880 + 30 = 881km/hr

Thus, we determine speed of the airplane relative to a stationary observer on the ground
to be 881 km/hr.

We note that the heading of the plane has been redirected in light of the cross wind. Let us
find the new heading of the plane. We use the tangent function as follows
Equation:

            tan() =                              30
                                                880

Applying the inverse tangent leaves us with
Equation:

            -1                                       0

 = tan (0.341) = 1.953

So we conclude the heading of the airplane will be directed 1.9530 from its initial
heading.

Boat and Trailer on an Inclined Ramp

Let us now consider another example that will allow us to apply 2-D vectors. Suppose
that a force of 750 pounds is required to pull a boat and trailer up a ramp that is inclined
at an angle of 200 from the horizon. This situation is depicted in Figure 3 (a). Under the
assumption of no friction, what is the combined weight of the boat and trailer?
     Depiction of a boat on a landing ramp along with a trigonometric
                                      description.

Let us now use the figure to interpret the vectors shown in Figure 3. The vector BA
represents the combined weight of the boat and the trailer. This is the quantity that we
need to find. The vector BC represents the force against the ramp. The vector AC which
is parallel to the ramp represents the force applied to the boat and trailer. From the
problem description we know that it has a magnitude of 750 pounds. We use the fact that
this is a right triangle to simplify our efforts.

We can apply the definition of the sine function to obtain
Equation:

                                                                                                                AC 

                                                                                                                                         0

                                                                                 sin(20 ) =
                                                                                                                BA 

Substitution leads to the equation
Equation:
                      0  750

sin(20 ) =

                          BA 

We can now solve for the weight of the boat and trailer
Equation:

                                                                   BA = 750/0.342 = 2,192lbs

Cable Tension for a Hanging Weight

A 200-pound weight is suspended from a ceiling. The weight is supported by two cables.
One cable makes a 200 angle away from the vertical and the other a 300 angle as shown in
Figure 4. Find the tension in each of the support cables.

Mass suspended from a beam with two cables.
Statics is the field of engineering that is used to solve problems of this sort. Because the
object does not move, it is said to be static. Another way to look at this, is that the object
is at equilibrium. At equilibrium, the forces acting on an object must balance. Otherwise,
the object would indeed move. To better analyze the situation, engineers often make use
of what is known as a free body diagram. Figure 5 shows the free body diagram related to
our problem.

Free body diagram of mass suspended from a beam with two cables.

The free body diagram shows the three forces that act on the object. The Figure also
shows the x-y coordinate system employed in this solution. The tension in cable 1 can be
resolved into its x and y components and written in vector notation as
Equation:

                                 0  0

T1 = -  T1  sin(20 )x ^+  T1  cos(20 )y^

Similarly, T2 can be written as
Equation:
                                        0                                                            0

                   T2 = T2  sin(30 )x ^+  T2  cos(30 )y^

The weight (W) is expressed as
Equation:

                                   W = -200y^

The sum of the forces acting on the object must be 0. Thus
Equation:

                                                                                        T1 + T2 = W

or
Equation:

                0               0              0                                                        0

-  T1  sin(20 )x ^+  T1  cos(20 )y^+  T2  sin(30 )x ^+  T2  cos(30 )y^ - 200y^ = 0

This problem can be simplified by writing an equation for solely the x-component
Equation:

                                   0              0

                   -  T1  sin(20 )+  T2  sin(30 ) = 0

We can do the same for the y-component
Equation:

                                0              0

                    T1  cos(20 )+  T2  cos(30 ) - 200 = 0

We begin by substituting in for the trigonometric function values to yield the following
set of equations
Equation:

                                                                     -0.342  T1  +0.5  T2 = 0

and
Equation:

                   0.940  T1  +0.866  T2 = 200

First, we find
Equation:

                             T2 = 0.684  T1 

This expression can then be substituted into the other equation
Equation:

                                                        0.940  T1  +0.866(0.684)  T1 = 200

This leads to the solution
Equation:

                             T1 = 130.5lbs

Next, we solve for the other variable
Equation:

                                                 T2 = 0.684  T1 = 0.684(130.5) = 89.3lbs

So we conclude that the tension in the cables are 130.5 lbs and 89.3 lbs respectively.
