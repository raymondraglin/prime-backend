          1.1: Logic in Everyday Language

Watch the videos on Logic and take notes on these pages.

A Proposition is a statement that makes a __________________. It must be a complete sentence.

          Which of the following are propositions?
              a. Anka is sitting on the table.

          b. Where are you going after class?

             A proposition has two possible truth values: ________________or __________________.

A negation of a proposition makes the ___________________ claim.
             Write a negation of the following statements:
                  a. Anka is sitting on the table.

          b. The dog is not in the back yard.

A double negation is when a negated proposition is itself negated.
             Turn each statement into a double negation:
                  a. I will not wash my hands

          b. It is unlikely that there is an association.

Logical Connectors

Using AND, OR, or IF...THEN to connect two or more separate propositions into a single
statement.

Examples:
     Ramesh has a cat AND Ramesh has a dog
     Ramesh has a cat OR a dog
     IF Ramesh has a cat, THEN Ramesh will get a dog

"AND" Statements - Conjunctions

An "AND" statement is true only when _____________ of the statements connected by the "and"
are _____________. If either or both are false, the "and" statement is false.

             Determine whether each AND statement is true or false:
                  a. Rabbits are fish and rattlesnakes have 4 legs
                  b. Math 105 is a PCC class and Portland Community College is located in
                      Oregon
                  c. Oprah Winfrey and Bill Clinton were U.S. Presidents

"OR" Statements - Disjunctions

In everyday life, "or" statements can be interpreted as inclusive (meaning either or both) or
exclusive (meaning either but not both).

    Determine whether each OR statement is inclusive or exclusive:
         a. Will you have the vegan or meat option at dinner?
         b. We want to hire someone who knows spreadsheets or QuickBooks.

In logic and mathematics, the "or" is always inclusive unless specified otherwise.

An "OR" statement is true when _____________ or _____________ of the statements connected by
the "or" are true. If both statements are false, the "or" statement is false.

          Determine whether each OR statement is true or false:
              a. Rabbits are fish or rattlesnakes have 4 legs.
              b. Math 105 is a PCC class or Portland Community College is located in Oregon
              c. Oprah Winfrey or Bill Clinton were U.S. Presidents

IF...THEN Statements - Conditional Statements
         Example: if the animal is a bird, then the animal has a beak.
         The "if" proposition is called the ____________________.
         The "then" proposition is called the ____________________________.

          Determine the hypothesis and conclusion in the example below:

          You'll be paid overtime if you work more than 10 hours today.
              a. Hypothesis:

              b. Conclusion:

When is an "IF...THEN" Statement True or False?

An If...then is false when the hypothesis is ______________ and the conclusion is ________________.

An If...then is true for all other situations, including when both the hypothesis and the
conclusion are false.

Example: You make this statement. "If I get elected, I will reduce college tuition."

If the hypothesis is true - you get elected, there are two possibilities
     If you reduce college tuition, the statement is ________________.
     If you don't reduce college tuition, the statement is ________________.

Say the hypothesis is false - You don't get elected
     The entire statement is not false because you didn't say anything about what
         you would do if you weren't elected, so it's ________________.

         Summarize If...Then rules

              If TRUE, then TRUE  TRUE
              If TRUE, then FALSE  FALSE
              If FALSE, then TRUE  TRUE
              If FALSE, then FALSE  TRUE

Does it work to reverse an If...Then statement?

Original Conditional Statement: If A, then B
Converse: If B, then A
Inverse: If not A, then not B
Contrapositive: If not B, then not A

             Which of these 4 statements are equivalent to each other?

                  a. Original: If you are not late, then you get coffee.

         b. Converse: If you get coffee, then you are not late.

         c. Inverse: If you are late, then you don't get coffee.

         d. Contrapositive: If you don't get coffee, then you are late.

Logical Equivalence                                                       Page 3
The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.
The converse and inverse are logically equivalent.

                      1.2: Sets and Venn Diagrams

Watch the video on Venn Diagrams and take notes on this page.

Types of Relationships
Draw a Venn diagram for each situation and describe the relationships between the sets.

a. Insects and flies  b. Insects and cats                      c. Athletes and Students

Four Categorical Propositions S: Subject Set  P: Predicate Set

a. All S are P        b. No S are P           c. Some S are P   d. Some S are not P
All children are      No college              Some college      Some college
people                students are cats       students are      students are not
                                              athletes          athletes

A Venn Diagram with Three Sets and Data
130 people were surveyed about the news sources that they
used on a regular basis.
The results are given in the Venn diagram:

  T represents television, I represents the Internet, and
  N represents newspapers

          a) Write a description for each of
          the eight areas.

          b) How many people used the
          Internet?

          c) How many people used at least
          two of the three sources?

          d) How many people didn't use
          newspapers?

Another Venn Diagram Example: How do you know when to subtract?

A survey was given asking whether people like espresso and/or chocolate. People could
check one or both boxes. Use the results to draw a Venn diagram and determine how many
people did not like either chocolate or espresso.

     150 people were surveyed
     132 people liked chocolate
     96 people liked espresso
     78 people checked both boxes

What is different in this problem than in the television, Internet and newspaper example? In
other words, how will you know when to subtract?
