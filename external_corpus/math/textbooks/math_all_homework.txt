Homework Write-up Instructions (No need to turn in this page)

The purpose of write-up assignments is for you to show me what you understand and how you would
present your reasoning so that I can give you feedback before you take your midterm and final exams.

Showing Your Work
Show all of your steps, in addition to your answer. Communication is a very important part of
mathematics. You will get full credit or partial credit based on the work you show and the correctness of
your answers. Answer questions using a complete sentence where indicated.

Formatting Your Work
You can write or type your work. If you type your work, use the .doc file. In Word or copy into Google
Docs. If you want to hand-write your work, print out the pdf file. I recommend practicing on scratch
paper first or printing out a clean copy for your final draft.

Uploading Your Work
No matter which method you choose, please upload your completed worksheet as 1 PDF file (Not
JPEG, Word, or a Zip folder) in the assignments tab in D2L by the assignment due date. The PDF format
allows me to read your document clearly and handle assignments more efficiently.

         You can use one of these free scanning apps for smartphones to scan as a PDF file. You can also
         use a home scanner, or scanners available at a library or a PCC campus (all of them have free
         scanners you can use).

         Adobe: https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/mobile-app/scan-documents.html

         Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intsig.camscanner&hl=en

Reading Feedback
I will grade your work by hand and write comments about what you did well and any ways you can
improve. You will be able to see your feedback in D2L within 1 week of the due date. It is important to
view the feedback before studying for the midterm or final test.

Complete the MyOpenMath online homework first
Watch the lecture videos and take notes first. Then use your notes to complete the MyOpenMath online
homework problems. This will build your confidence by giving you instant feedback. Keep working on
each problem until you get them all correct. You have unlimited tries on each problem. Seek out help
from me, the tutoring center or etutoring as needed. The write-up is meant to be completed after
watching the videos, taking notes and completing the online homework.

Resources
Feel free to get help from me, tutoring centers and etutoring. You may also ask any clarifying questions
in the Student Q and A discussion board, where you can post anonymously, or the Homework Questions
board. If you use the discussion forums for any "how to" questions, please use examples that are similar
to, but not the same as the problems in the assignment. We will all work together to help each other!

Section 5.1: Apportionment

It's very important to acknowledge that when Hamilton, Jefferson and others were making the rules for
apportionment, black people were owned and enslaved in the United States. The 3/5 rule counted the
black population as only 3/5 of the white population. We need to remember why we still have racism and
systemic inequality now and continue to make our systems fair for everyone.

    state will get based on its population. There must be a total of 26 representatives. Determine how

         month for 10 years with the same interest, how much would he have?

2. Should the drinking age should be lowered to age 18? To address this question, researchers

    randomly select 1000 US adults: two hundred and fifty 18-24-year-olds, two hundred and fifty 25-
    40-year-olds, two hundred and fifty 40-55-year-olds, and two hundred and fifty over 55-year-olds.
    Overall, 73% of those surveyed said no, the drinking age should not be lowered to age 18. The

Note that racial categories have been socially constructed and have many limitations. The US
Census does not have a category for people from the Middle East, who have been traditionally
categorized as white. This may not feel representative to them (about 3 million people).
*Multiracial was not a category so people may be listed in more than one category. That's why the
total is more than 221 people.

Section 4.2: Theoretical Probability

2. Toma Todo, or Pirinola, is a game of chance from Mexico. Children as
    well as adults play toma todo with a pirinola, which is a six-sided top.
    Each of six possible outcomes on the pirinola is equally likely to occur.
    To win, each player must acquire all the beans from the other players.

    To begin the game, each player has 10 beans and places 1 bean in a
    center pile. Turns are taken. A turn consists of spinning the pirinola and
    following the directions on the side that is faceup after the spin.

                                                                                            Page 2

The sides of the Pirinola contain this information:

     pon 1 (put in 1 bean)
     pon 2 (put in 2)
     toma todo (take all)
     toma 1 (take 1)
     toma 2 (take 2)
     todos ponen (each player puts 1 in the pile)
If the toma todo side lands faceup, then to continue the game, each player
must place 1 bean in a center pile again. Play continues until one player has
all the beans. Source: https://www.uccs.edu/Documents/pipes/mccoyprob-games.pdf
