1.8 · Describing and Critiquing Arguments
1.8.5 · Exercises

1.8.5.1.

   a. The argument is inductive.

   b. The argument is deductive.
     1.8.5.3. Premise: All cats are scared of vacuum cleaners.
     Premise: Max is a cat.
     Conclusion: Max must be scared of vacuum cleaners.
     This is a deductive argument. It is valid. However, it is not sound because the premise all cats are afraid
     of vacuum cleaners is false. While many cats are afraid of vacuum cleaners not ALL cats are afraid.
     There are many videos of cats riding electronic vacuum cleaners.

     1.8.5.5. Premise: Kiran's female and nonbinary friends made less than Kiran's male friends.
     Conclusion: Women and nonbinary people make less than men.
     This is an inductive argument. Kiran did not gather a large diverse sample because they only asked their
     friends. Therefore, their data has sampling bias. This makes their argument weak.

     1.8.5.7. Premise: All bicycles have two wheels.
     Premise: My friend's Harley-Davidson motorcycle has two wheels.
     Conclusion: It must be a bicycle.
     This is a deductive argument. The argument is not valid. Based on the premises, we know that the
     friend's Harley-Davidson motorcycle has two wheels, but we do not know whethere or not it is a bicycle.
     Because it is not valid, it is also not sound.
                                                                                                                                    323

1.8.5.9. Premise: All students drink a lot of caffeine.
Premise: Brayer drinks a lot of caffeine.
Conclusion: He must be a student.
This is a deductive argument. The argument is not valid. We can not determine if Brayer is a student
or not. Because it is not valid it is also not sound.

1.8.5.11. Premise: People on this reality show are self-absorbed.
Premise: Laura is not self-absorbed.
Conclusion: Laura cannot be on this reality show.
This argument is deductive. The argument is valid because Laura is outside of the set of self-absorbed
people, so she must also be outside of this set of people on this reality show. Determining if this conclusion
is sound is more difficult because determining if someone is self-absorbed is subjective.
324  APPENDIX A. ODD ANSWERS

     1.8.5.13. The argument is valid and sound.
     1.8.5.15. The argument is not valid, and it is not sound.

     1.8.5.17. This argument is valid, and it is sound. Because Ethan is in the set of folks who missed 25%

   Note the entry in cell B3 here is = B2*103% and the remaining cells are computed using the fill down
   feature.

   You will have to wait a minimum of 24 full years, in each case, in order for the balance to finally exceed
   twice the opening deposit amount.

e. Since (103%)23 < 2 < (103%)24, the minimum number of full years until the opening deposit doubles
   must be the same here, for any positive opening balance that we may choose for this account.

            =PV(0.045/12,12*20,1266.71) which gives $200,223.07.

        c. This will be the present value of the remaining 120 loan payments:
           =PV(0.045/12,12*10,1266.71) which gives $122,223.99.

        d. At the beginning of the repayment period, most of each payment goes to interest (thus the loan
            balance reduces very slowly at first). Over time, more of each payment shifts to principal, and less
            to interest. At the end of the loan repayment period, nearly all the payment is going to principal.

    2.4.9.15. =FV(0.035/12,3*12,200,0) = $7,579.95. Paul will have $7,579.95 in 3 years.

    2.4.9.17. =PV(0.028/12,4*12,100,0) = $4,535.96. Miao can finance $4,535.96 in equipment to have a
    monthly loan payment of $100 for 4 years.

    2.4.9.19. =PMT(0.043/12,30*12,364500,0) = $1,803.81. Their mortgage payment would be $1,803.81.

    2.4.9.21. For the first plan: =FV(0.048/12,20*12,150,0) = $60,251.26. Zahid would have $60,251.26
    if he puts in $150 per month for 20 years.
    For the second plan: =FV(0.048/12,10*12,300,0) = $46,089.59. Zahid would only have $46,089.59 if he
    waited and put in $300 per month for 10 years.

2.5.14.1. A credit decreases your bill more. It decreases your bill by the full amount of the credit. A
deduction only decreases your tax bill by a percentage.
2.5.14.3. The amount of taxes owed is decreased by $60 because 12% of $500 is $60.
2.5.14.5. Yes, you can make adjustments and take a deduction. Adjustments to your income happen before
deductions.
2.5.14.7. Shaysiah should itemize because itemizing reduces her taxable income by $15,400. The standard
deduction would have reduced her taxable income by $14,600.
2.5.14.9. No, Fredrick should not be concerned. Only the $1000 will be taxed at 22%. The rest of his
income will be taxed at a lower level.
2.5.14.11. There is a total of $35,550 between $11,600 and $47,150. 12% of $35,550 is $4,266.
2.5.14.13. $16,589 in taxes minus $13,456 for withholdings, and they can claim and $2,500 in credits. This
leaves them owing $633.
2.5.14.15.

   a. Take the income minus the adjustments 135000 - 5600 = $129,400. Their adjusted gross income is
       $129,400.

   b. They should take the standard deduction because itemizing saves them less.

   c. Taxable income: 129400 - 29200 = 100200
       Taxes owed: 10852 + 0.22  (100200 - 94300) = $12,150
       They owe $12,150 in taxes.

   d. 12150 - 15000 = -$2,850 Take the taxes owed minus credits and withholdings. They will receive a
       refund for $2,850.

2.5.14.17.

   a. Gross Income: 96000 + 850 = $96,850

   b. Adjusted Gross Income: 96850 - 26000 = $70,850

   c. She should take itemized deductions since they are greater than the standard deduction for head of
       household.

   d. Taxable Income: 70850 - 22600 = $48,250

   e. Tax from Table: 1665 + 0.12  (48250 - 16650) = $5,457. Owed/Refund: 5457-4000-5300 = -$3,843

3.2.24.19. The graph would be more effective at displaying the true differences between the categories if
the vertical scale started at 0. The vertical axis is missing a label and units, so we can't tell if those are
frequencies or relative frequencies. A flat bar graph (instead of the 3d graph) would be easier to read.
3.2.24.21. This is a poor graph because the vertical axis does not have a numerical scale, so we cannot know
how many have each drink as a favorite drink. We also don't know if the bottom vertical line represents 0,
which is potentially misleading.

   a. In Excel:
       =average(7.50,25,10,10,7.50,8.25,9,5,15,8,7.25,7.50,8,7,12)
       = $9.80
       There are 15 amounts shown, so n = 15. The mean is:

                    x¯ = (7.50 + 25 + 10 + 10 + 7.50 + 8.25 + 9 + 5 + 15 + 8 + 7.25 + 7.50 + 8 + 7 + 12)
                                                                            15

                      = $9.80

       = $8.00
       There are 15 times shown, so n = 15. We start by listing the data in order:
       $5, $7, $7.25, $7.50, $7.50, $7.50, $8, $8, $8.25, $9, $10, $10, $12, $15, $25
       Median = $8.00

   c. Since the mean is greater than the median, we would expect the distribution will be skewed right.

   a. In Excel:
       =average(15.2,18.8,19.3,19.7,20.2,21.8,22.1,29.4)
       = 20.81 seconds
       There are 8 times shown, so n = 8.

                                    x¯ = (15.2 + 18.8 + 19.3 + 19.7 + 20.2 + 21.8 + 22.1 + 29.4)

       =median(15.2,18.8,19.3,19.7,20.2,21.8,22.1,29.4)
       = 19.95 seconds
       There are 8 times shown, so n = 8. The times are given already in order:
       15.2, 18.8, 19.3, 19.7, 20.2, 21.8, 22.1, 29.4

                                                          Median = 19.7 + 20.2
                                                                                2

                                                                      = 19.95 seconds

   c. Since the mean and median are approximately equal, we would expect that the distribution is symmet-
       ric.

3.3.7.5.
   a. In GeoGebra Classic, enter the costs into the column A and frequencies into column B of the spreadsheet
       and use the "One Variable Analysis" function. Then use the "Show Statistics" option.

                                                   Mean = 33.8 thousand dollars

   The sum of the frequencies is 75, so n = 75

                         x¯ = 15 · 3 + 20 · 7 + 25 · 10 + 30 · 15 + 35 · 13 + 40 · 11 + 45 · 9 + 50 · 7
                                                                        75

                            = 33.8 thousand dollars

b. In GeoGebra Classic, enter the costs into the column A and frequencies into column B of the spreadsheet
    and use the "One Variable Analysis" function. Then use the "Show Statistics" option.

                                  Median = 35 thousand dollars

Since there are 75 values (an odd number), we know that the median will be the single middle data

value.  Because  75  = 37.5,  we  know  it  will  be  the  38th  value  in  the  list.  The  38th  value  is  35,  so  the
                 2
median is 35 thousand dollars.

   c. Since the mean is less than the median, we would expect the distribution to be skewed left.
3.3.7.7.

a. For Researcher 1:
   In Excel:
   =average(A1:A40)
   = 23.6 months.
   =median(A1:A40)
   = 24 months
   The mean for Researcher 1's patients is 23.6 months, and the median for Researcher's 1 patients is 24
   months.
   For Researcher 2:
340  APPENDIX A. ODD ANSWERS

       In Excel:

       =average(A1:A40)

       = 22.8 months
       =median(A1:A40)

       = 22 months
       The mean for Researcher 2's patients is 22.8 months, and the median is 22 months

   b. Both the mean and median for Researcher 1's patients are greater than the mean and median for
       Researcher 2's patients. So, on average, Researcher 1's patients have a longer life time after starting
       the cancer treatment than Researcher 2's patients.

3.3.7.9. GeoGebra was used to create the histograms. You should check with your instructor to see if
histograms are to be hand-drawn or computer generated. Answers will vary depending on the size of the
margins and the programs you are using.

a. Figure A.0.1 Histogram for Average Number of Pieces Correctly Remembered by Non-players
   Figure A.0.2 Histogram for Average Number of Pieces Correctly Remembered by Beginners

       Figure A.0.3 Histogram for Average Number of Pieces Correctly Remembered by Tournament Players

   b. The mean number of pieces correctly remembered for non-players was 33.65 pieces.
       The mean number of pieces correctly remembered for beginners was 47.6 pieces.
       The mean number of pieces correctly remembered for tournament players was 64.98 pieces.

   c. The median number of pieces correctly remembered for non-players was 33.5 pieces.
       The median number of pieces correctly remembered for beginners was 51.3 pieces.
       The median number of pieces correctly remembered for tournament players was 71.1 pieces.

   d. The distribution for non-players appears to be uniform. The distribution for beginners looks unimodal
       and left-skewed. The distribution for tournament players appears bimodal and symmetric.
       The mean and median number of pieces correctly remembered were both greatest for tournament
       players, with non-players having the smallest mean and median of pieces correctly remembered.

3.3.7.11.

   a. There are many possible answers for this problem. Three data sets with 5 values each that have the
       same mean but different medians are:

                               0, 0, 0, 0, 10
                               0, 0, 2, 4, 4

                               1, 5, 10, 10, 10

3.3.7.13.

a. This graph is skewed left.

   b. I expect that the mean is less than the median because the graph is skewed left.
3.3.7.15.

3.4.10.1.

   a. In Excel:
       Entering the data values into cells A1 through A15.

                 s = stdev.s(A1 : A15)
                   = $4.82

     From Exercise 3.3.7.1, the mean is $9.80. There are 15 data values, so n = 15.
     We will make a table of data values, their deviations from the mean, and the squared deviations:

     Data Value  Deviation           Deviation Squared
     7.5         7.5 - 9.8 = -2.3    (-2.3)2 = 5.29
     25          25 - 9.8 = 15.2     (15.2)2 = 231.04
     10          10 - 9.8 = 0.2      (0.2)2 = 0.04
     10          10 - 9.8 = 0.2      (0.2)2 = 0.04
     7.5         7.5 - 9.8 = -2.3    (-2.3)2 = 5.29
     8.25        8.25 - 9.8 = -1.55  (-1.55)2 = 2.4
     9           9 - 9.8 = -0.8      (-0.8)2 = 0.64
     5           5 - 9.8 = -4.8      (-4.8)2 = 23.04
     15          15 - 9.8 = 5.2      (5.2)2 = 27.04
     8           8 - 9.8 = -1.8      (-1.8)2 = 3.24
     7.25        7.25 - 9.8 = -2.55  (-2.55)2 = 6.5
     7.5         7.5 - 9.8 = -2.3    (-2.3)2 = 5.29
     8           8 - 9.8 = -1.8      (-1.8)2 = 3.24
     7           7 - 9.8 = -2.8      (-2.8)2 = 7.84
     12          12 - 9.8 = 2.2      (2.2)2 = 4.84

     Next, we add the squared deviations and get 5.29 + 231.04 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 5.29 + 2.4 + 0.64 + 23.04 +
     27.04 + 3.24 + 6.5 + 5.29 + 3.24 + 7.84 + 4.84 = 325.78 dollars-squared.

     The sample standard deviation is:

                      
                 s = 325.78

                            14
                   = $4.82

b. In GeoGebra:

    In GeoGebra Classic, enter the data values into the column A of the spreadsheet and use the "One
   Variable Analysis" function. Then use the "Show Statistics" option to find the five-number summary.

     Min Q1 Median Q3 Max

     $5 $7.50    $8                  $10 $25
                                                                     343

From Exercise 3.3.7.1, the data listed in order is:
$5.00, $7.00, $7.25, $7.50, $7.50, $7.50, $8.00, $8.00, $8.25, $9.00, $10.00, $10.00, $12.00, $15.00, $25.00
Also from Exercise 3.3.7.1, there are 15 data values (n = 15), and the median is $8.00. The lower half
of the data is:
$5.00, $7.00, $7.25, $7.50, $7.50, $7.50, $8.00
The median of the lower half is $7.50, so the lower quartile Q1 is $7.50.
The upper half of the data is:
$8.25, $9.00, $10.00, $10.00, $12.00, $15.00, $25.00
The median of the upper half is $10.00, so the upper quartile Q3 is $10.00.
The smallest and largest data values are $5.00 and 25.00, respectively, so the min and max are $5.00
and $25.00. The five-number summary is:

                  Min Q1 Median Q3 Max

                  $5 $7.50         $8                       $10 $25

                                            = $20

The interquartile range (IQR) is:

                                   IQR = Q3 - Q1
                                         = 10 - 7.5

   a. There are many possible answers for this question. For example, the data sets {10, 10, 10, 10, 10}
       and {9, 9, 10, 11, 11} have the same mean of 10 units, but different standard deviations (0 and 1,
       respectively).

   b. There are many possible answers for this question. For example, the data sets {2, 2, 2, 2, 2} and {9,
       9, 9, 9, 9} have the same standard deviation of 0, but different means (2 and 9, respectively).

3.4.10.13.

   a. The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are, respectively, the 1st quartile, median, and 3rd quartile for
       the data sets. Reading the boxplot for CPAs, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for CPAs' salaries
       are, respectively, $40,000, $75,000, and $90,000. Reading the boxplot for actuaries, the 25th, 50th, and
       75th percentiles for actuaries' salaries are, respectively, $75,000, $90,000, and $94,000

   b. Deshawn's salary (the median salary for an actuary) is $90,000; Kelsey's salary (the first quartile salary)
       is also $75,000. So Deshawn makes more than Kelsey, by $15,000.

   c. 75% of actuaries make more than the median salary of a CPA ($75,000).

   d. 25% of all CPAs earn less than all actuaries.

   g. Yes, it appears that having no credit cards depends on age. The probability of having no credit cards for
       people over age 35 is significantly greater than the probability of having no credits for people between
       the ages of 18 and 35.

   h. Yes, it does appear that survival depended on the passenger's class. The probability of survival for
       first class passengers is significantly greater than the probability of survival for second class passengers
       and is more than double the probability of survival for third class passengers.
