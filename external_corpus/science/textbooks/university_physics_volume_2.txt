1.6 Mechanisms of Heat Transfer

INTRODUCTION Heat and temperature are important concepts for each of us, every day. How we dress in the
morning depends on whether the day is hot or cold, and most of what we do requires energy that ultimately comes
from the Sun. The study of heat and temperature is part of an area of physics known as thermodynamics. The laws
of thermodynamics govern the flow of energy throughout the universe. They are studied in all areas of science and
engineering, from chemistry to biology to environmental science.
In this chapter, we explore heat and temperature. It is not always easy to distinguish these terms. Heat is the flow of
energy from one object to another. This flow of energy is caused by a difference in temperature. The transfer of heat
can change temperature, as can work, another kind of energy transfer that is central to thermodynamics. We return
to these basic ideas several times throughout the next four chapters, and you will see that they affect everything
from the behavior of atoms and molecules to cooking to our weather on Earth to the life cycles of stars.
6  1 · Temperature and Heat

   1.1 Temperature and Thermal Equilibrium

   LEARNING OBJECTIVES
   By the end of this section, you will be able to:

       · Define temperature and describe it qualitatively
       · Explain thermal equilibrium
       · Explain the zeroth law of thermodynamics

   Heat is familiar to all of us. We can feel heat entering our bodies from the summer Sun or from hot coffee or tea after
   a winter stroll. We can also feel heat leaving our bodies as we feel the chill of night or the cooling effect of sweat
   after exercise.

   What is heat? How do we define it and how is it related to temperature? What are the effects of heat and how does it
   flow from place to place? We will find that, in spite of the richness of the phenomena, a small set of underlying
   physical principles unites these subjects and ties them to other fields. We start by examining temperature and how
   to define and measure it.

   Temperature

   The concept of temperature has evolved from the common concepts of hot and cold. The scientific definition of
   temperature explains more than our senses of hot and cold. As you may have already learned, many physical
   quantities are defined solely in terms of how they are observed or measured, that is, they are defined operationally.
   Temperature is operationally defined as the quantity of what we measure with a thermometer. As we will see in
   detail in a later chapter on the kinetic theory of gases, temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of
   translation, a fact that provides a more physical definition. Differences in temperature maintain the transfer of heat,
   or heat transfer, throughout the universe. Heat transfer is the movement of energy from one place or material to
   another as a result of a difference in temperature. (You will learn more about heat transfer later in this chapter.)

   Thermal Equilibrium

   An important concept related to temperature is thermal equilibrium. Two objects are in thermal equilibrium if they
   are in close contact that allows either to gain energy from the other, but nevertheless, no net energy is transferred
   between them, or, even when not in contact, if no net energy is transferred between them when they are brought
   into contact. If two objects remain in contact for a long time, they typically come to equilibrium. In other words, two
   objects in thermal equilibrium do not exchange energy.

   Experimentally, if object A is in equilibrium with object B, and object B is in equilibrium with object C, then (as you
   may have already guessed) object A is in equilibrium with object C. That statement of transitivity is called the zeroth
   law of thermodynamics. (The number "zeroth" was suggested by British physicist Ralph Fowler in the 1930s. The
   first, second, and third laws of thermodynamics were already named and numbered then. The zeroth law had
   seldom been stated, but it needs to be discussed before the others, so Fowler gave it a smaller number.) Consider
   the case where A is a thermometer. The zeroth law tells us that if A reads a certain temperature when in equilibrium
   with B, and it is then placed in contact with C, it will not exchange energy with C; therefore, its temperature reading
   will remain the same (Figure 1.2). In other words, if two objects are in thermal equilibrium, they have the same
   temperature.

   FIGURE 1.2 If thermometer A is in thermal equilibrium with object B, and B is in thermal equilibrium with C, then A is in thermal equilibrium
   with C. Therefore, the reading on A stays the same when A is moved over to make contact with C.

   A thermometer measures its own temperature. It is through the concepts of thermal equilibrium and the zeroth law
   of thermodynamics that we can say that a thermometer measures the temperature of something else, and to make
   sense of the statement that two objects are at the same temperature.

In the rest of this chapter, we will often refer to "systems" instead of "objects." As in the chapter on linear
momentum and collisions, a system consists of one or more objects--but in thermodynamics, we require a system
to be macroscopic, that is, to consist of a huge number (such as ) of molecules. Then we can say that a system
is in thermal equilibrium with itself if all parts of it are at the same temperature. (We will return to the definition of a
thermodynamic system in the chapter on the first law of thermodynamics.)

1.2 Thermometers and Temperature Scales

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe several different types of thermometers
    · Convert temperatures between the Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales

Any physical property that depends consistently and reproducibly on temperature can be used as the basis of a
thermometer. For example, volume increases with temperature for most substances. This property is the basis for
the common alcohol thermometer and the original mercury thermometers. Other properties used to measure
temperature include electrical resistance, color, and the emission of infrared radiation (Figure 1.3).

FIGURE 1.3 Because many physical properties depend on temperature, the variety of thermometers is remarkable. (a) In this common type

of thermometer, the alcohol, containing a red dye, expands more rapidly than the glass encasing it. When the thermometer's temperature

increases, the liquid from the bulb is forced into the narrow tube, producing a large change in the length of the column for a small change in

temperature. (b) Each of the six squares on this plastic (liquid crystal) thermometer contains a film of a different heat-sensitive liquid

crystal material. Below  , all six squares are black. When the plastic thermometer is exposed to a temperature of  , the first liquid

crystal square changes color. When the temperature reaches above  , the second liquid crystal square also changes color, and so

forth. (c) A firefighter uses a pyrometer to check the temperature of an aircraft carrier's ventilation system. The pyrometer measures

infrared radiation (whose emission varies with temperature) from the vent and quickly produces a temperature readout. Infrared

thermometers are also frequently used to measure body temperature by gently placing them in the ear canal. Such thermometers are more

accurate than the alcohol thermometers placed under the tongue or in the armpit. (credit b: modification of work by Tess Watson; credit c:

modification of work by Lamel J. Hinton, U.S. Navy)

Thermometers measure temperature according to well-defined scales of measurement. The three most common
temperature scales are Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. Temperature scales are created by identifying two
reproducible temperatures. The freezing and boiling temperatures of water at standard atmospheric pressure are
commonly used.
8  1 · Temperature and Heat

   On the Celsius scale, the freezing point of water is    and the boiling point is       The unit of temperature on

   this scale is the degree Celsius . The Fahrenheit scale (still the most frequently used for common purposes in

   the United States) has the freezing point of water at   and the boiling point at       Its unit is the degree

   Fahrenheit ( ). You can see that 100 Celsius degrees span the same range as 180 Fahrenheit degrees. Thus, a

   temperature difference of one degree on the Celsius scale is 1.8 times as large as a difference of one degree on the

   Fahrenheit scale, or

   The definition of temperature in terms of molecular motion suggests that there should be a lowest possible
   temperature, where the average kinetic energy of molecules is zero (or the minimum allowed by quantum
   mechanics). Experiments confirm the existence of such a temperature, called absolute zero. An absolute
   temperature scale is one whose zero point is absolute zero. Such scales are convenient in science because several
   physical quantities, such as the volume of an ideal gas, are directly related to absolute temperature.

   The Kelvin scale is the absolute temperature scale that is commonly used in science. The SI temperature unit is the
   kelvin, which is abbreviated K (not accompanied by a degree sign). Thus 0 K is absolute zero. The freezing and
   boiling points of water are 273.15 K and 373.15 K, respectively. Therefore, temperature differences are the same in
   units of kelvins and degrees Celsius, or

   The relationships between the three common temperature scales are shown in Figure 1.4. Temperatures on these
   scales can be converted using the equations in Table 1.1.

Converting between Temperature Scales: Room Temperature

"Room temperature" is generally defined in physics to be  . (a) What is room temperature in  ? (b) What is it in

K?

Strategy
To answer these questions, all we need to do is choose the correct conversion equations and substitute the known
values.

Solution         to , use the equation
To convert from

Substitute the known value into the equation and solve:

Similarly, we find that                 .

The Kelvin scale is part of the SI system of units, so its actual definition is more complicated than the one given
above. First, it is not defined in terms of the freezing and boiling points of water, but in terms of the triple point. The
triple point is the unique combination of temperature and pressure at which ice, liquid water, and water vapor can
coexist stably. As will be discussed in the section on phase changes, the coexistence is achieved by lowering the
pressure and consequently the boiling point to reach the freezing point. The triple-point temperature is defined as
273.16 K. This definition has the advantage that although the freezing temperature and boiling temperature of water
depend on pressure, there is only one triple-point temperature.

Second, even with two points on the scale defined, different thermometers give somewhat different results for other
temperatures. Therefore, a standard thermometer is required. Metrologists (experts in the science of measurement)
have chosen the constant-volume gas thermometer for this purpose. A vessel of constant volume filled with gas is
subjected to temperature changes, and the measured temperature is proportional to the change in pressure. Using
"TP" to represent the triple point,

The results depend somewhat on the choice of gas, but the less dense the gas in the bulb, the better the results for
different gases agree. If the results are extrapolated to zero density, the results agree quite well, with zero pressure
corresponding to a temperature of absolute zero.
Constant-volume gas thermometers are big and come to equilibrium slowly, so they are used mostly as standards to
calibrate other thermometers.

1.3 Thermal Expansion

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Answer qualitative questions about the effects of thermal expansion
    · Solve problems involving thermal expansion, including those involving thermal stress
10  1 · Temperature and Heat

    The expansion of alcohol in a thermometer is one of many commonly encountered examples of thermal expansion,
    which is the change in size or volume of a given system as its temperature changes. The most visible example is the
    expansion of hot air. When air is heated, it expands and becomes less dense than the surrounding air, which then
    exerts an (upward) force on the hot air and makes steam and smoke rise, hot air balloons float, and so forth. The
    same behavior happens in all liquids and gases, driving natural heat transfer upward in homes, oceans, and weather
    systems, as we will discuss in an upcoming section. Solids also undergo thermal expansion. Railroad tracks and
    bridges, for example, have expansion joints to allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes,
    as shown in Figure 1.5.

    FIGURE 1.5 (a) Thermal expansion joints like these in the (b) Trojan Bridge in Prague, Czech Republic allow bridges to change length
    without buckling. (credit: modification of works by "SJ"/Wikimedia Commons)

    What is the underlying cause of thermal expansion? As previously mentioned, an increase in temperature means an
    increase in the kinetic energy of individual atoms. In a solid, unlike in a gas, the molecules are held in place by
    forces from neighboring molecules; as we saw in Oscillations (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-
    volume-1/pages/15-introduction), the forces can be modeled as in harmonic springs described by the Lennard-
    Jones potential. Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/
    15-2-energy-in-simple-harmonic-motion) shows that such potentials are asymmetrical in that the potential energy
    increases more steeply when the molecules get closer to each other than when they get farther away. Thus, at a
    given kinetic energy, the distance moved is greater when neighbors move away from each other than when they
    move toward each other. The result is that increased kinetic energy (increased temperature) increases the average
    distance between molecules--the substance expands.
    For most substances under ordinary conditions, it is an excellent approximation that there is no preferred direction
    (that is, the solid is "isotropic"), and an increase in temperature increases the solid's size by a certain fraction in
    each dimension. Therefore, if the solid is free to expand or contract, its proportions stay the same; only its overall
    size changes.

      LINEAR THERMAL EXPANSION

      According to experiments, the dependence of thermal expansion on temperature, substance, and original initial
      length is summarized in the equation

                                                                                                                                                        1.1

linear expansion, a material property that varies slightly with temperature. As  is nearly constant and also very
small, for practical purposes, we use the linear approximation:                                                      1.2

it is expressed in units of degrees Celsius or kelvins; thus, may have units of  or 1/K with the same value in

either case. Approximating as a constant is quite accurate for small changes in temperature and sufficient for most

practical purposes, even for large changes in temperature. We examine this approximation more closely in the next

example.

    certain temperature, as in older or analog thermostats.

over many expansion joints so that the expansion at each joint is small.

Thermal Expansion in Two and Three Dimensions

Unconstrained objects expand in all dimensions, as illustrated in Figure 1.7. That is, their areas and volumes, as well
as their lengths, increase with temperature. Because the proportions stay the same, holes and container volumes
also get larger with temperature. If you cut a hole in a metal plate, the remaining material will expand exactly as it
would if the piece you removed were still in place. The piece would get bigger, so the hole must get bigger too.

   THERMAL EXPANSION IN TWO DIMENSIONS

   For small temperature changes, the change in area is given by
                                                                                                                                                    1.3

   where is the change in area  is the change in temperature, and is the coefficient of linear expansion,

   which varies slightly with temperature. (The derivation of this equation is analogous to that of the more

   important equation for three dimensions, below.)

FIGURE 1.7 In general, objects expand in all directions as temperature increases. In these drawings, the original boundaries of the objects
are shown with solid lines, and the expanded boundaries with dashed lines. (a) Area increases because both length and width increase. The
area of a circular plug also increases. (b) If the plug is removed, the hole it leaves becomes larger with increasing temperature, just as if the
expanding plug were still in place. (c) Volume also increases, because all three dimensions increase.

   THERMAL EXPANSION IN THREE DIMENSIONS

   The relationship between volume and temperature is given by             , where is the coefficient of

   volume expansion. As you can show in Exercise 1.60,  . This equation is usually written as

                                                                                                                  1.4

   Note that the values of in Table 1.2 are equal to except for rounding.

Volume expansion is defined for liquids, but linear and area expansion are not, as a liquid's changes in linear
dimensions and area depend on the shape of its container. Thus, Table 1.2 shows liquids' values of but not .

In general, objects expand with increasing temperature. Water is the most important exception to this rule. Water

does expand with increasing temperature (its density decreases) at temperatures greater than                   .

However, it is densest at  and expands with decreasing temperature between  and

(  ), as shown in Figure 1.8. A striking effect of this phenomenon is the freezing of water in a pond.

When water near the surface cools down to  it is denser than the remaining water and thus sinks to the bottom.

This "turnover" leaves a layer of warmer water near the surface, which is then cooled. However, if the temperature

in the surface layer drops below , that water is less dense than the water below, and thus stays near the top. As

a result, the pond surface can freeze over. The layer of ice insulates the liquid water below it from low air

    temperatures. Fish and other aquatic life can survive in  water beneath ice, due to this unusual characteristic of
    water.

    FIGURE 1.8 This curve shows the density of water as a function of temperature. Note that the thermal expansion at low temperatures is

    very small. The maximum density at  is only    greater than the density at , and  greater than that at . The

    decrease of density below  occurs because the liquid water approachs the solid crystal form of ice, which contains more empty space

    than the liquid.

    Calculating Thermal Expansion

    Suppose your 60.0-L                 -gal) steel gasoline tank is full of gas that is cool because it has just been pumped

    from an underground reservoir. Now, both the tank and the gasoline have a temperature of         How much

    gasoline has spilled by the time they warm to  ?

    Strategy

    The tank and gasoline increase in volume, but the gasoline increases more, so the amount spilled is the difference in
    their volume changes. We can use the equation for volume expansion to calculate the change in volume of the
    gasoline and of the tank. (The gasoline tank can be treated as solid steel.)

    Solution

    1. Use the equation for volume expansion to calculate the increase in volume of the steel tank:

    2. The increase in volume of the gasoline is given by this equation:

    3. Find the difference in volume to determine the amount spilled as

    Alternatively, we can combine these three equations into a single equation. (Note that the original volumes are
    equal.)

    Significance
    This amount is significant, particularly for a 60.0-L tank. The effect is so striking because the gasoline and steel
    expand quickly. The rate of change in thermal properties is discussed later in this chapter.

If you try to cap the tank tightly to prevent overflow, you will find that it leaks anyway, either around the cap or by
bursting the tank. Tightly constricting the expanding gas is equivalent to compressing it, and both liquids and solids
resist compression with extremely large forces. To avoid rupturing rigid containers, these containers have air gaps,
which allow them to expand and contract without stressing them.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 1.1

Does a given reading on a gasoline gauge indicate more gasoline in cold weather or in hot weather, or does the
temperature not matter?

Thermal Stress

If you change the temperature of an object while preventing it from expanding or contracting, the object is subjected
to stress that is compressive if the object would expand in the absence of constraint and tensile if it would contract.
This stress resulting from temperature changes is known as thermal stress. It can be quite large and can cause
damage.

To avoid this stress, engineers may design components so they can expand and contract freely. For instance, in
highways, gaps are deliberately left between blocks to prevent thermal stress from developing. When no gaps can
be left, engineers must consider thermal stress in their designs. Thus, the reinforcing rods in concrete are made of
steel because steel's coefficient of linear expansion is nearly equal to that of concrete.

To calculate the thermal stress in a rod whose ends are both fixed rigidly, we can think of the stress as developing in
two steps. First, let the ends be free to expand (or contract) and find the expansion (or contraction). Second, find the
stress necessary to compress (or extend) the rod to its original length by the methods you studied in Static
Equilibrium and Elasticity (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/12-introduction) on static
equilibrium and elasticity. In other words, the of the thermal expansion equals the of the elastic distortion
(except that the signs are opposite).

According to the chapter on static equilibrium and elasticity, the stress F/A is given by

where Y is the Young's modulus of the material--concrete, in this case. In thermal expansion,               We

combine these two equations by noting that the two  are equal, as stated above. Because we are not given

or A, we can obtain a numerical answer only if they both cancel out.

Solution

    1.4 Heat Transfer, Specific Heat, and Calorimetry

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Explain phenomena involving heat as a form of energy transfer
        · Solve problems involving heat transfer

    We have seen in previous chapters that energy is one of the fundamental concepts of physics. Heat is a type of
    energy transfer that is caused by a temperature difference, and it can change the temperature of an object. As we
    learned earlier in this chapter, heat transfer is the movement of energy from one place or material to another as a
    result of a difference in temperature. Heat transfer is fundamental to such everyday activities as home heating and
    cooking, as well as many industrial processes. It also forms a basis for the topics in the remainder of this chapter.

    We also introduce the concept of internal energy, which can be increased or decreased by heat transfer. We discuss
    another way to change the internal energy of a system, namely doing work on it. Thus, we are beginning the study of
    the relationship of heat and work, which is the basis of engines and refrigerators and the central topic (and origin of
    the name) of thermodynamics.

    Internal Energy and Heat

    A thermal system has internal energy, which is the sum of the microscopic energies of the system. This includes
    thermal energy, which is associated with the mechanical energies of its molecules and which is proportional to the
    system's temperature. As we saw earlier in this chapter, if two objects at different temperatures are brought into
    contact with each other, energy is transferred from the hotter to the colder object until the bodies reach thermal
    equilibrium (that is, they are at the same temperature). No work is done by either object because no force acts
    through a distance (as we discussed in Work and Kinetic Energy (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-
    volume-1/pages/7-introduction)). These observations reveal that heat is energy transferred spontaneously due to a
    temperature difference. Figure 1.9 shows an example of heat transfer.

    FIGURE 1.9 (a) Here, the soft drink has a higher temperature than the ice, so they are not in thermal equilibrium. (b) When the soft drink
    and ice are allowed to interact, heat is transferred from the drink to the ice due to the difference in temperatures until they reach the same

temperature, , achieving equilibrium. In fact, since the soft drink and ice are both in contact with the surrounding air and the bench, the
ultimate equilibrium temperature will be the same as that of the surroundings.

The meaning of "heat" in physics is different from its ordinary meaning. For example, in conversation, we may say
"the heat was unbearable," but in physics, we would say that the temperature was high. Heat is a form of energy
flow, whereas temperature is not. Incidentally, humans are sensitive to heat flow rather than to temperature.

Since heat is a form of energy, its SI unit is the joule (J). Another common unit of energy often used for heat is the

calorie (cal), defined as the energy needed to change the temperature of 1.00 g of water by      --specifically,

between  and  , since there is a slight temperature dependence. Also commonly used is the

kilocalorie (kcal), which is the energy needed to change the temperature of 1.00 kg of water by             . Since mass

is most often specified in kilograms, the kilocalorie is convenient. Confusingly, food calories (sometimes called "big

calories," abbreviated Cal) are actually kilocalories, a fact not easily determined from package labeling.

Mechanical Equivalent of Heat

It is also possible to change the temperature of a substance by doing work, which transfers energy into or out of a
system. This realization helped establish that heat is a form of energy. James Prescott Joule (1818-1889)
performed many experiments to establish the mechanical equivalent of heat--the work needed to produce the
same effects as heat transfer. In the units used for these two quantities, the value for this equivalence is

We consider this equation to represent the conversion between two units of energy. (Other numbers that you may

see refer to calories defined for temperature ranges other than           to  .)

Figure 1.10 shows one of Joule's most famous experimental setups for demonstrating that work and heat can
produce the same effects and measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. It helped establish the principle of
conservation of energy. Gravitational potential energy (U) was converted into kinetic energy (K), and then
randomized by viscosity and turbulence into increased average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in the
system, producing a temperature increase. Joule's contributions to thermodynamics were so significant that the SI
unit of energy was named after him.

FIGURE 1.10 Joule's experiment established the equivalence of heat and work. As the masses descended, they caused the paddles to do

work,    , on the water. The result was a temperature increase, , measured by the thermometer. Joule found that was

proportional to W and thus determined the mechanical equivalent of heat.

Increasing internal energy by heat transfer gives the same result as increasing it by doing work. Therefore, although
a system has a well-defined internal energy, we cannot say that it has a certain "heat content" or "work content." A
well-defined quantity that depends only on the current state of the system, rather than on the history of that system,
18  1 · Temperature and Heat

    is known as a state variable. Temperature and internal energy are state variables. To sum up this paragraph, heat
    and work are not state variables.

    Incidentally, increasing the internal energy of a system does not necessarily increase its temperature. As we'll see in
    the next section, the temperature does not change when a substance changes from one phase to another. An
    example is the melting of ice, which can be accomplished by adding heat or by doing frictional work, as when an ice
    cube is rubbed against a rough surface.

    Temperature Change and Heat Capacity

    We have noted that heat transfer often causes temperature change. Experiments show that with no phase change
    and no work done on or by the system, the transferred heat is typically directly proportional to the change in
    temperature and to the mass of the system, to a good approximation. (Below we show how to handle situations
    where the approximation is not valid.) The constant of proportionality depends on the substance and its phase,
    which may be gas, liquid, or solid. We omit discussion of the fourth phase, plasma, because although it is the most
    common phase in the universe, it is rare and short-lived on Earth.

    We can understand the experimental facts by noting that the transferred heat is the change in the internal energy,

    which is the total energy of the molecules. Under typical conditions, the total kinetic energy of the molecules

    is a constant fraction of the internal energy (for reasons and with exceptions that we'll see in the next chapter). The

    average kinetic energy of a molecule  is proportional to the absolute temperature. Therefore, the change in

    internal energy of a system is typically proportional to the change in temperature and to the number of molecules,

    N. Mathematically,                           The dependence on the substance results in large part from

    the different masses of atoms and molecules. We are considering its heat capacity in terms of its mass, but as we

    will see in the next chapter, in some cases, heat capacities per molecule are similar for different substances. The

    dependence on substance and phase also results from differences in the potential energy associated with

    interactions between atoms and molecules.

    HEAT TRANSFER AND TEMPERATURE CHANGE

    A practical approximation for the relationship between heat transfer and temperature change is:
                                                                                                                                                     1.5

    where Q is the symbol for heat transfer ("quantity of heat"), m is the mass of the substance, and is the

    change in temperature. The symbol c stands for the specific heat (also called "specific heat capacity") and

    depends on the material and phase. In the SI system, the specific heat is numerically equal to the amount of

    heat necessary to change the temperature of  kg of mass by  . The SI unit for specific heat is

               or                    . (Recall that the temperature change is the same in units of kelvin and degrees

    Celsius.)

    Values of specific heat must generally be measured, because there is no simple way to calculate them precisely.
    Table 1.3 lists representative values of specific heat for various substances. We see from this table that the specific
    heat of water is five times that of glass and 10 times that of iron, which means that it takes five times as much heat
    to raise the temperature of water a given amount as for glass, and 10 times as much as for iron. In fact, water has
    one of the largest specific heats of any material, which is important for sustaining life on Earth.

    The specific heats of gases depend on what is maintained constant during the heating--typically either the volume
    or the pressure. In the table, the first specific heat value for each gas is measured at constant volume, and the
    second (in parentheses) is measured at constant pressure. We will return to this topic in the chapter on the kinetic
    theory of gases.

    In general, specific heat also depends on temperature. Thus, a precise definition of c for a substance must be given

    in terms of an infinitesimal change in temperature. To do this, we note that                 and replace with d:

    Except for gases, the temperature and volume dependence of the specific heat of most substances is weak at
    normal temperatures. Therefore, we will generally take specific heats to be constant at the values given in the table.

    EXAMPLE 1.5

    Calculating the Required Heat

    A 0.500-kg aluminum pan on a stove and 0.250 L of water in it are heated from                to  . (a) How much

    heat is required? What percentage of the heat is used to raise the temperature of (b) the pan and (c) the water?

    Strategy

    We can assume that the pan and the water are always at the same temperature. When you put the pan on the stove,
    the temperature of the water and that of the pan are increased by the same amount. We use the equation for the
    heat transfer for the given temperature change and mass of water and aluminum. The specific heat values for water
    and aluminum are given in Table 1.3.

    Solution

    1. Calculate the temperature difference:

    2. Calculate the mass of water. Because the density of water is                , 1 L of water has a mass of 1 kg, and

    the mass of 0.250 L of water is                 .

    3. Calculate the heat transferred to the water. Use the specific heat of water in Table 1.3:

    4. Calculate the heat transferred to the aluminum. Use the specific heat for aluminum in Table 1.3:

    5. Find the total transferred heat:

    Significance

    In this example, the heat transferred to the water is more than the aluminum pan. Although the mass of the pan is
    twice that of the water, the specific heat of water is over four times that of aluminum. Therefore, it takes a bit more
    than twice as much heat to achieve the given temperature change for the water as for the aluminum pan.

    energy had been added with a blowtorch instead of mechanically.)

        EXAMPLE 1.6

Calculating the Temperature Increase from the Work Done on a Substance

Truck brakes used to control speed on a downhill run do work, converting gravitational potential energy into
increased internal energy (higher temperature) of the brake material (Figure 1.11). This conversion prevents the
gravitational potential energy from being converted into kinetic energy of the truck. Since the mass of the truck is
much greater than that of the brake material absorbing the energy, the temperature increase may occur too fast for
sufficient heat to transfer from the brakes to the environment; in other words, the brakes may overheat.

FIGURE 1.11 The smoking brakes on a braking truck are visible evidence of the mechanical equivalent of heat.

Calculate the temperature increase of 10 kg of brake material with an average specific heat of                if the

material retains 10% of the energy from a 10,000-kg truck descending 75.0 m (in vertical displacement) at a

constant speed.

Strategy
We calculate the gravitational potential energy (Mgh) that the entire truck loses in its descent, equate it to the
increase in the brakes' internal energy, and then find the temperature increase produced in the brake material alone.

Solution
First we calculate the change in gravitational potential energy as the truck goes downhill:

Because the kinetic energy of the truck does not change, conservation of energy tells us the lost potential energy is

dissipated, and we assume that 10% of it is transferred to internal energy of the brakes, so take             . Then

we calculate the temperature change from the heat transferred, using

where m is the mass of the brake material. Insert the given values to find

Significance

If the truck had been traveling for some time, then just before the descent, the brake temperature would probably
be higher than the ambient temperature. The temperature increase in the descent would likely raise the
temperature of the brake material very high, so this technique is not practical. Instead, the truck would use the
technique of engine braking. A different idea underlies the recent technology of hybrid and electric cars, where
22  1 · Temperature and Heat

    mechanical energy (kinetic and gravitational potential energy) is converted by the brakes into electrical energy in the
    battery, a process called regenerative braking.

    In a common kind of problem, objects at different temperatures are placed in contact with each other but isolated
    from everything else, and they are allowed to come into equilibrium. A container that prevents heat transfer in or out
    is called a calorimeter, and the use of a calorimeter to make measurements (typically of heat or specific heat
    capacity) is called calorimetry.

    We will use the term "calorimetry problem" to refer to any problem in which the objects concerned are thermally
    isolated from their surroundings. An important idea in solving calorimetry problems is that during a heat transfer
    between objects isolated from their surroundings, the heat gained by the colder object must equal the heat lost by
    the hotter object, due to conservation of energy:

                                                                                                                                                           1.6

    We express this idea by writing that the sum of the heats equals zero because the heat gained is usually considered
    positive; the heat lost, negative.

    EXAMPLE 1.7

    Calculating the Final Temperature in Calorimetry

    Suppose you pour 0.250 kg of     water (about a cup) into a 0.500-kg aluminum pan off the stove with a

    temperature of  . Assume no heat transfer takes place to anything else: The pan is placed on an insulated pad,

    and heat transfer to the air is neglected in the short time needed to reach equilibrium. Thus, this is a calorimetry

    problem, even though no isolating container is specified. Also assume that a negligible amount of water boils off.

    What is the temperature when the water and pan reach thermal equilibrium?

    Strategy

    Originally, the pan and water are not in thermal equilibrium: The pan is at a higher temperature than the water. Heat
    transfer restores thermal equilibrium once the water and pan are in contact; it stops once thermal equilibrium
    between the pan and the water is achieved. The heat lost by the pan is equal to the heat gained by the water--that is
    the basic principle of calorimetry.

    Solution

    1. Use the equation for heat transfer  to express the heat transferred from the pan in terms of the

    mass of the pan, the specific heat of aluminum, the initial temperature of the pan, and the final temperature:

    2. Express the heat gained by the water in terms of the mass of the water, the specific heat of water, the initial
         temperature of the water, and the final temperature:

    3. Note that              and          and that as stated above, they must sum to zero:

Significance

Why is the final temperature so much closer to  than to            ? The reason is that water has a greater

specific heat than most common substances and thus undergoes a smaller temperature change for a given heat

transfer. A large body of water, such as a lake, requires a large amount of heat to increase its temperature

appreciably. This explains why the temperature of a lake stays relatively constant during the day even when the

temperature change of the air is large. However, the water temperature does change over longer times (e.g.,

summer to winter).

Temperature-Dependent Heat Capacity

At low temperatures, the specific heats of solids are typically proportional to . The first understanding of this
behavior was due to the Dutch physicist Peter Debye, who in 1912, treated atomic oscillations with the quantum
theory that Max Planck had recently used for radiation. For instance, a good approximation for the specific heat of

salt, NaCl, is                       The constant 321 K is called the Debye temperature of NaCl, and

the formula works well when          Using this formula, how much heat is required to raise the temperature
of 24.0 g of NaCl from 5 K to 15 K?

Solution
Because the heat capacity depends on the temperature, we need to use the equation

We solve this equation for Q by integrating both sides:
Then we substitute the given values in and evaluate the integral:

1.5 Phase Changes

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe phase transitions and equilibrium between phases
    · Solve problems involving latent heat
    · Solve calorimetry problems involving phase changes

Phase transitions play an important theoretical and practical role in the study of heat flow. In melting (or "fusion"), a
solid turns into a liquid; the opposite process is freezing. In evaporation, a liquid turns into a gas; the opposite
process is condensation.
24  1 · Temperature and Heat

    A substance melts or freezes at a temperature called its melting point, and boils (evaporates rapidly) or condenses

    at its boiling point. These temperatures depend on pressure. High pressure favors the denser form, so typically, high

    pressure raises the melting point and boiling point, and low pressure lowers them. For example, the boiling point of

    water is  at 1.00 atm. At higher pressure, the boiling point is higher, and at lower pressure, it is lower. The

    main exception is the melting and freezing of water, discussed in the next section.

    Phase Diagrams

    The phase of a given substance depends on the pressure and temperature. Thus, plots of pressure versus
    temperature showing the phase in each region provide considerable insight into thermal properties of substances.
    Such a pT graph is called a phase diagram.

    Figure 1.12 shows the phase diagram for water. Using the graph, if you know the pressure and temperature, you can

    determine the phase of water. The solid curves--boundaries between phases--indicate phase transitions, that is,

    temperatures and pressures at which the phases coexist. For example, the boiling point of water is  at 1.00

    atm. As the pressure increases, the boiling temperature rises gradually to           at a pressure of 218 atm. A

    pressure cooker (or even a covered pot) cooks food faster than an open pot, because the water can exist as a liquid

    at temperatures greater than         without all boiling away. (As we'll see in the next section, liquid water conducts

    heat better than steam or hot air.) The boiling point curve ends at a certain point called the critical point--that is, a

    critical temperature, above which the liquid and gas phases cannot be distinguished; the substance is called a

    supercritical fluid. At sufficiently high pressure above the critical point, the gas has the density of a liquid but does

    not condense. Carbon dioxide, for example, is supercritical at all temperatures above    . Critical pressure is

    the pressure of the critical point.

    FIGURE 1.12 The phase diagram (pT graph) for water shows solid (s), liquid (l), and vapor (v) phases. At temperatures and pressure above
    those of the critical point, there is no distinction between liquid and vapor. Note that the axes are nonlinear and the graph is not to scale.
    This graph is simplified--it omits several exotic phases of ice at higher pressures. The phase diagram of water is unusual because the
    melting-point curve has a negative slope, showing that you can melt ice by increasing the pressure.

    Similarly, the curve between the solid and liquid regions in Figure 1.12 gives the melting temperature at various

    pressures. For example, the melting point is  at 1.00 atm, as expected. Water has the unusual property that ice

    is less dense than liquid water at the melting point, so at a fixed temperature, you can change the phase from solid

    (ice) to liquid (water) by increasing the pressure. That is, the melting temperature of ice falls with increased

    pressure, as the phase diagram shows. For example, when a car is driven over snow, the increased pressure from

    the tires melts the snowflakes; afterwards, the water refreezes and forms an ice layer.

    As you learned in the earlier section on thermometers and temperature scales, the triple point is the combination of

    temperature and pressure at which ice, liquid water, and water vapor can coexist stably--that is, all three phases

    exist in equilibrium. For water, the triple point occurs at                 and 611.2 Pa; that is a more accurate

     INTERACTIVE

View this video (https://openstax.org/l/21triplepoint) to see a substance at its triple point.

At pressures below that of the triple point, there is no liquid phase; the substance can exist as either gas or solid.

For water, there is no liquid phase at pressures below 0.00600 atm. The phase change from solid to gas is called

sublimation. You may have noticed that snow can disappear into thin air without a trace of liquid water, or that ice

cubes can disappear in a freezer. Both are examples of sublimation. The reverse also happens: Frost can form on

very cold windows without going through the liquid stage. Figure 1.13 shows the result, as well as showing a familiar

example of sublimation. Carbon dioxide has no liquid phase at atmospheric pressure. Solid          is known as dry ice

because instead of melting, it sublimes. Its sublimation temperature at atmospheric pressure is    . Certain air

fresheners use the sublimation of a solid to spread a perfume around a room. Some solids, such as osmium

tetroxide, are so toxic that they must be kept in sealed containers to prevent human exposure to their sublimation-

produced vapors.

FIGURE 1.13 Direct transitions between solid and vapor are common, sometimes useful, and even beautiful. (a) Dry ice sublimes directly to
carbon dioxide gas. The visible "smoke" consists of water droplets that condensed in the air cooled by the dry ice. (b) Frost forms patterns

Equilibrium

At the melting temperature, the solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium. If heat is added, some of the solid will

melt, and if heat is removed, some of the liquid will freeze. The situation is somewhat more complex for liquid-gas

equilibrium. Generally, liquid and gas are in equilibrium at any temperature. We call the gas phase a vapor when it

exists at a temperature below the critical temperature, as it does for water at  . Liquid in a closed container at

a fixed temperature evaporates until the pressure of the gas reaches a certain value, called the vapor pressure,

which depends on the gas and the temperature. At this equilibrium, if heat is added, some of the liquid will

evaporate, and if heat is removed, some of the gas will condense; molecules either join the liquid or form suspended

droplets. If there is not enough liquid for the gas to reach the vapor pressure in the container, all the liquid

eventually evaporates.

If the vapor pressure of the liquid is greater than the total ambient pressure, including that of any air (or other gas),
the liquid evaporates rapidly; in other words, it boils. Thus, the boiling point of a liquid at a given pressure is the
temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure. Liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium at
the boiling temperature (Figure 1.14). If a substance is in a closed container at the boiling point, then the liquid is
boiling and the gas is condensing at the same rate without net change in their amounts.
26  1 · Temperature and Heat

    FIGURE 1.14 Equilibrium between liquid and gas at two different boiling points inside a closed container. (a) The rates of boiling and
    condensation are equal at this combination of temperature and pressure, so the liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium. (b) At a higher
    temperature, the boiling rate is faster, that is, the rate at which molecules leave the liquid and enter the gas is faster. This increases the
    number of molecules in the gas, which increases the gas pressure, which in turn increases the rate at which gas molecules condense and
    enter the liquid. The pressure stops increasing when it reaches the point where the boiling rate and the condensation rate are equal. The
    gas and liquid are in equilibrium again at this higher temperature and pressure.

    For water,        is the boiling point at 1.00 atm, so water and steam should exist in equilibrium under these

    conditions. Why does an open pot of water at  boil completely away? The gas surrounding an open pot is not

    pure water: it is mixed with air. If pure water and steam are in a closed container at  and 1.00 atm, they will

    coexist--but with air over the pot, there are fewer water molecules to condense, and water boils away. At any given

    temperature, including when boiling, vapor is generated at the corresponding saturation vapor pressure. This may

    be less than the ambient pressure, but part of the ambient pressure is due to air, so the pressure of the vapor above

    the pot can be less than the pressure of the vapor being generated at that temperature, and evaporation continues.

    Incidentally, the equilibrium vapor pressure of solids is not zero, a fact that accounts for sublimation.

    Phase Change and Latent Heat

    So far, we have discussed heat transfers that cause temperature change. However, in a phase transition, heat
    transfer does not cause any temperature change.

    For an example of phase changes, consider the addition of heat to a sample of ice at     (Figure 1.15) and

    atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the ice rises linearly, absorbing heat at a constant rate of

    until it reaches  Once at this temperature, the ice begins to melt and continues until it has all melted, absorbing

    333 kJ/kg of heat. The temperature remains constant at        during this phase change. Once all the ice has melted,

    the temperature of the liquid water rises, absorbing heat at a new constant rate of      At                     the

    water begins to boil. The temperature again remains constant during this phase change while the water absorbs

    2256 kJ/kg of heat and turns into steam. When all the liquid has become steam, the temperature rises again,

    absorbing heat at a rate of      . If we started with steam and cooled it to make it condense into liquid

    water and freeze into ice, the process would exactly reverse, with the temperature again constant during each phase

    transition.

so that, when vaporization occurs, the vapor remains in the system. The long stretches of constant temperatures at  and  reflect

the large amounts of heat needed to cause melting and vaporization, respectively.

Where does the heat added during melting or boiling go, considering that the temperature does not change until the
transition is complete? Energy is required to melt a solid, because the attractive forces between the molecules in
the solid must be broken apart, so that in the liquid, the molecules can move around at comparable kinetic energies;
thus, there is no rise in temperature. Energy is needed to vaporize a liquid for similar reasons. Conversely, work is
done by attractive forces when molecules are brought together during freezing and condensation. That energy must
be transferred out of the system, usually in the form of heat, to allow the molecules to stay together (Figure 1.18).
Thus, condensation occurs in association with cold objects--the glass in Figure 1.16, for example.

FIGURE 1.16 Condensation forms on this glass of iced tea because the temperature of the nearby air is reduced. The air cannot hold as
much water as it did at room temperature, so water condenses. Energy is released when the water condenses, speeding the melting of the
ice in the glass. (credit: Jenny Downing)

The energy released when a liquid freezes is used by orange growers when the temperature approaches .
Growers spray water on the trees so that the water freezes and heat is released to the growing oranges. This
prevents the temperature inside the orange from dropping below freezing, which would damage the fruit (Figure
1.17).

    dropping below . Water is intentionally sprayed on orchards to help prevent hard frosts. (credit: Hermann Hammer)

    The energy involved in a phase change depends on the number of bonds or force pairs and their strength. The
    number of bonds is proportional to the number of molecules and thus to the mass of the sample. The energy per
    unit mass required to change a substance from the solid phase to the liquid phase, or released when the substance
    changes from liquid to solid, is known as the heat of fusion. The energy per unit mass required to change a
    substance from the liquid phase to the vapor phase is known as the heat of vaporization. The strength of the forces
    depends on the type of molecules. The heat Q absorbed or released in a phase change in a sample of mass m is
    given by

                                                                                                                                                           1.7

    where the latent heat of fusion and latent heat of vaporization are material constants that are determined
    experimentally. (Latent heats are also called latent heat coefficients and heats of transformation.) These constants
    are "latent," or hidden, because in phase changes, energy enters or leaves a system without causing a temperature
    change in the system, so in effect, the energy is hidden.

    FIGURE 1.18 (a) Energy is required to partially overcome the attractive forces (modeled as springs) between molecules in a solid to form a
    liquid. That same energy must be removed from the liquid for freezing to take place. (b) Molecules become separated by large distances
    when going from liquid to vapor, requiring significant energy to completely overcome molecular attraction. The same energy must be
    removed from the vapor for condensation to take place.

Phase changes can have a strong stabilizing effect on temperatures that are not near the melting and boiling points,
since evaporation and condensation occur even at temperatures below the boiling point. For example, temperatures
in humid weather rarely fall below the dew point--the temperature where condensation occurs given the
concentration of water vapor in the air--because so much heat is released when water vapor condenses.

More energy is required to evaporate water below the boiling point than at the boiling point, because the kinetic

energy of water molecules at temperatures below  is less than that at   , so less energy is available from

random thermal motions. For example, at body temperature, evaporation of sweat from the skin requires a heat

input of 2428 kJ/kg, which is about 10% higher than the latent heat of vaporization at  . This heat comes from

the skin, and this evaporative cooling effect of sweating helps reduce the body temperature in hot weather.

However, high humidity inhibits evaporation, so that body temperature might rise, while unevaporated sweat might

be left on your brow.

    EXAMPLE 1.9

    Calculating Final Temperature from Phase Change

    Three ice cubes are used to chill a soda at      with mass        . The ice is at              and each ice cube

    has a mass of 6.0 g. Assume that the soda is kept in a foam container so that heat loss can be ignored and that the

    soda has the same specific heat as water. Find the final temperature when all ice has melted.

    Strategy

    The ice cubes are at the melting temperature of  Heat is transferred from the soda to the ice for melting.

    Melting yields water at          so more heat is transferred from the soda to this water until the water plus soda

    system reaches thermal equilibrium.

    The heat transferred to the ice is

    The heat transferred by the soda is

    Since no heat is lost,                as in Example 1.7, so that

    Solve for the unknown quantity :

    Solution                                                          and the mass of soda is
    First we identify the known quantities. The mass of ice is

                            Then we calculate the final temperature:

    Significance

    This example illustrates the large energies involved during a phase change. The mass of ice is about 7% of the mass

    of the soda but leads to a noticeable change in the temperature of the soda. Although we assumed that the ice was

    at the freezing temperature, this is unrealistic for ice straight out of a freezer: The typical temperature is      .

    However, this correction makes no significant change from the result we found. Can you explain why?

    Like solid-liquid and liquid-vapor transitions, direct solid-vapor transitions or sublimations involve heat. The energy

    transferred is given by the equation         , where is the heat of sublimation, analogous to and . The

    heat of sublimation at a given temperature is equal to the heat of fusion plus the heat of vaporization at that

    temperature.

    We can now calculate any number of effects related to temperature and phase change. In each case, it is necessary
    to identify which temperature and phase changes are taking place. Keep in mind that heat transfer and work can
    cause both temperature and phase changes.

            PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

    The Effects of Heat Transfer

      1. Examine the situation to determine that there is a change in the temperature or phase. Is there heat transfer
            into or out of the system? When it is not obvious whether a phase change occurs or not, you may wish to first
            solve the problem as if there were no phase changes, and examine the temperature change obtained. If it is

sufficient to take you past a boiling or melting point, you should then go back and do the problem in

steps--temperature change, phase change, subsequent temperature change, and so on.

2. Identify and list all objects that change temperature or phase.

3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful.

4. Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). If there

is a temperature change, the transferred heat depends on the specific heat of the substance (Heat Transfer,

Specific Heat, and Calorimetry), and if there is a phase change, the transferred heat depends on the latent

heat of the substance (Table 1.4).

5. Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown).

6. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions

complete with units. You may need to do this in steps if there is more than one state to the process, such as a

temperature change followed by a phase change. However, in a calorimetry problem, each step corresponds

to a term in the single equation    .

7. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable. Does it make sense? As an example, be certain that any

temperature change does not also cause a phase change that you have not taken into account.

1.6 Mechanisms of Heat Transfer

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain some phenomena that involve conductive, convective, and radiative heat transfer
    · Solve problems on the relationships between heat transfer, time, and rate of heat transfer
    · Solve problems using the formulas for conduction and radiation

Just as interesting as the effects of heat transfer on a system are the methods by which it occurs. Whenever there is
a temperature difference, heat transfer occurs. It may occur rapidly, as through a cooking pan, or slowly, as through
the walls of a picnic ice chest. So many processes involve heat transfer that it is hard to imagine a situation where no
heat transfer occurs. Yet every heat transfer takes place by only three methods:

  1. Conduction is heat transfer through stationary matter by physical contact. (The matter is stationary on a
        macroscopic scale--we know that thermal motion of the atoms and molecules occurs at any temperature
        above absolute zero.) Heat transferred from the burner of a stove through the bottom of a pan to food in the
        pan is transferred by conduction.

  2. Convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a fluid. This type of transfer takes place in a
        forced-air furnace and in weather systems, for example.

  3. Heat transfer by radiation occurs when microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, or another form of
        electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed. An obvious example is the warming of Earth by the Sun. A
        less obvious example is thermal radiation from the human body.

In the illustration at the beginning of this chapter, the fire warms the snowshoers' faces largely by radiation.
Convection carries some heat to them, but most of the air flow from the fire is upward (creating the familiar shape of
flames), carrying heat to the food being cooked and into the sky. The snowshoers wear clothes designed with low
conductivity to prevent heat flow out of their bodies.

In this section, we examine these methods in some detail. Each method has unique and interesting characteristics,
but all three have two things in common: there is a net transfer of heat solely because of a temperature difference,
and the greater the temperature difference, the faster the heat transfer (Figure 1.19).
32  1 · Temperature and Heat

    FIGURE 1.19 In a fireplace, heat transfer occurs by all three methods: conduction, convection, and radiation. Radiation is responsible for
    most of the heat transferred into the room. Heat transfer also occurs through conduction into the room, but much slower. Heat transfer by
    convection also occurs through cold air entering the room around windows and hot air leaving the room by rising up the chimney.
    Convection also contributes to heat transfer indirectly by circulating the air in the room and thereby increasing conduction.

         CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 1.6

    Name an example from daily life (different from the text) for each mechanism of heat transfer.

    Conduction

    As you walk barefoot across the living room carpet in a cold house and then step onto the kitchen tile floor, your feet
    feel colder on the tile. This result is intriguing, since the carpet and tile floor are both at the same temperature. The
    different sensation is explained by the different rates of heat transfer: The heat loss is faster for skin in contact with
    the tiles than with the carpet, so the sensation of cold is more intense.
    Some materials conduct thermal energy faster than others. Figure 1.20 shows a material that conducts heat
    slowly--it is a good thermal insulator, or poor heat conductor--used to reduce heat flow into and out of a house.

(in summer). (credit: Giles Douglas)

A molecular picture of heat conduction will help justify the equation that describes it. Figure 1.21 shows molecules
in two bodies at different temperatures, and for "hot" and "cold." The average kinetic energy of a molecule in
the hot body is higher than in the colder body. If two molecules collide, energy transfers from the high-energy to the
low-energy molecule. In a metal, the picture would also include free valence electrons colliding with each other and
with atoms, likewise transferring energy. The cumulative effect of all collisions is a net flux of heat from the hotter
body to the colder body. Thus, the rate of heat transfer increases with increasing temperature difference

                      If the temperatures are the same, the net heat transfer rate is zero. Because the number of
collisions increases with increasing area, heat conduction is proportional to the cross-sectional area--a second
factor in the equation.

FIGURE 1.21 Molecules in two bodies at different temperatures have different average kinetic energies. Collisions occurring at the contact
surface tend to transfer energy from high-temperature regions to low-temperature regions. In this illustration, a molecule in the lower-
temperature region (right side) has low energy before collision, but its energy increases after colliding with a high-energy molecule at the
contact surface. In contrast, a molecule in the higher-temperature region (left side) has high energy before collision, but its energy
decreases after colliding with a low-energy molecule at the contact surface.

A third quantity that affects the conduction rate is the thickness of the material through which heat transfers. Figure
34  1 · Temperature and Heat

    1.22 shows a slab of material with a higher temperature on the left than on the right. Heat transfers from the left to
    the right by a series of molecular collisions. The greater the distance between hot and cold, the more time the
    material takes to transfer the same amount of heat.

    FIGURE 1.22 Heat conduction occurs through any material, represented here by a rectangular bar, whether window glass or walrus
    blubber.

    All four of these quantities appear in a simple equation deduced from and confirmed by experiments. The rate of
    conductive heat transfer through a slab of material, such as the one in Figure 1.22, is given by

                                                                                                                                                           1.9

    conductivity of the material. Table 1.5 gives representative values of thermal conductivity.

    More generally, we can write

    where x is the coordinate in the direction of heat flow. Since in Figure 1.22, the power and area are constant, dT/dx

Calculating Heat Transfer through Conduction

A polystyrene foam icebox has a total area of  and walls with an average thickness of 2.50 cm. The box

contains ice, water, and canned beverages at   The inside of the box is kept cold by melting ice. How much ice

melts in one day if the icebox is kept in the trunk of a car at  ?

Strategy

This question involves both heat for a phase change (melting of ice) and the transfer of heat by conduction. To find
the amount of ice melted, we must find the net heat transferred. This value can be obtained by calculating the rate
of heat transfer by conduction and multiplying by time.

Solution
First we identify the knowns.

for polystyrene foam;                                                          ;  ;

Then we identify the unknowns. We need to solve for the mass of the ice, m. We also need to solve for the net heat
transferred to melt the ice, Q. The rate of heat transfer by conduction is given by
36  1 · Temperature and Heat

    The heat used to melt the ice is           .We insert the known values:

    Multiplying the rate of heat transfer by the time we obtain  and solve for the mass m:
    We set this equal to the heat transferred to melt the ice,

    Significance
    The result of 3.44 kg, or about 7.6 lb, seems about right, based on experience. You might expect to use about a 4 kg
    (7-10 lb) bag of ice per day. A little extra ice is required if you add any warm food or beverages.

    Table 1.5 shows that polystyrene foam is a very poor conductor and thus a good insulator. Other good insulators
    include fiberglass, wool, and goosedown feathers. Like polystyrene foam, these all contain many small pockets of
    air, taking advantage of air's poor thermal conductivity.

    In developing insulation, the smaller the conductivity k and the larger the thickness d, the better. Thus, the ratio d/k,

    called the R factor, is large for a good insulator. The rate of conductive heat transfer is inversely proportional to R. R

    factors are most commonly quoted for household insulation, refrigerators, and the like. Unfortunately, in the United

    States, R is still in non-metric units of  , although the unit usually goes unstated [1 British thermal unit

    (Btu) is the amount of energy needed to change the temperature of 1.0 lb of water by  , which is 1055.1 J]. A

    couple of representative values are an R factor of 11 for 3.5-inch-thick fiberglass batts (pieces) of insulation and an

    R factor of 19 for 6.5-inch-thick fiberglass batts (Figure 1.23). In the US, walls are usually insulated with 3.5-inch

    batts, whereas ceilings are usually insulated with 6.5-inch batts. In cold climates, thicker batts may be used.

Note that in Table 1.5, most of the best thermal conductors--silver, copper, gold, and aluminum--are also the best
electrical conductors, because they contain many free electrons that can transport thermal energy. (Diamond, an
electrical insulator, conducts heat by atomic vibrations.) Cooking utensils are typically made from good conductors,
but the handles of those used on the stove are made from good insulators (bad conductors).

EXAMPLE 1.11

Two Conductors End to End

A steel rod and an aluminum rod, each of diameter 1.00 cm and length 25.0 cm, are welded end to end. One end of

the steel rod is placed in a large tank of boiling water at  , while the far end of the aluminum rod is placed in a

large tank of water at     . The rods are insulated so that no heat escapes from their surfaces. What is the

temperature at the joint, and what is the rate of heat conduction through this composite rod?

Strategy

The heat that enters the steel rod from the boiling water has no place to go but through the steel rod, then through
the aluminum rod, to the cold water. Therefore, we can equate the rate of conduction through the steel to the rate of
conduction through the aluminum.

We repeat the calculation with a second method, in which we use the thermal resistance R of the rod, since it simply
adds when two rods are joined end to end. (We will use a similar method in the chapter on direct-current circuits.)

Solution

1. Identify the knowns and convert them to SI units.

The length of each rod is                                    the cross-sectional area of each rod is

                                  the thermal conductivity of aluminum is                             , the

thermal conductivity of steel is                             , the temperature at the hot end is      , and the

temperature at the cold end is    .

2. Calculate the heat-conduction rate through the steel rod and the heat-conduction rate through the aluminum

rod in terms of the unknown temperature T at the joint:

3. Set the two rates equal and solve for the unknown temperature:

4. Calculate either rate:

5. If desired, check your answer by calculating the other rate.

Solution

1. Recall that          . Now

2. We know that                                              . We also know that                      and we denote

that rate of heat flow by P. Combine the equations:
38  1 · Temperature and Heat

    Thus, we can simply add R factors. Now,                     .

    3. Find the from the known quantities:

    and

    4. Substitute these values in to find    as before.

    5. Determine for the aluminum rod (or for the steel rod) and use it to find T at the joint.

         so                                , as in Solution .
    6. If desired, check by determining     for the other rod.

    Significance

    In practice, adding R values is common, as in calculating the R value of an insulated wall. In the analogous situation
    in electronics, the resistance corresponds to R/A in this problem and is additive even when the areas are unequal, as
    is common in electronics. Our equation for heat conduction can be used only when the areas are equal; otherwise,
    we would have a problem in three-dimensional heat flow, which is beyond our scope.

    How does the rate of heat transfer by conduction change when all spatial dimensions are doubled?

    Conduction is caused by the random motion of atoms and molecules. As such, it is an ineffective mechanism for
    heat transport over macroscopic distances and short times. For example, the temperature on Earth would be
    unbearably cold during the night and extremely hot during the day if heat transport into and through the atmosphere
    were only through conduction and radiation. Also, car engines would overheat unless there was a more efficient way
    to remove excess heat from the pistons. The next module discusses the important heat-transfer mechanism in such
    situations.

    Convection

    In convection, thermal energy is carried by the large-scale flow of matter. It can be divided into two types. In forced
    convection, the flow is driven by fans, pumps, and the like. A simple example is a fan that blows air past you in hot
    surroundings and cools you by replacing the air heated by your body with cooler air. A more complicated example is
    the cooling system of a typical car, in which a pump moves coolant through the radiator and engine to cool the
    engine and a fan blows air to cool the radiator.

    In free or natural convection, the flow is driven by buoyant forces: hot fluid rises and cold fluid sinks because
    density decreases as temperature increases. The house in Figure 1.24 is kept warm by natural convection, as is the
    pot of water on the stove in Figure 1.25. Ocean currents and large-scale atmospheric circulation, which result from
    the buoyancy of warm air and water, transfer hot air from the tropics toward the poles and cold air from the poles
    toward the tropics. (Earth's rotation interacts with those flows, causing the observed eastward flow of air in the
    temperate zones.)

FIGURE 1.24 Air heated by a so-called gravity furnace expands and rises, forming a convective loop that transfers energy to other parts of
the room. As the air is cooled at the ceiling and outside walls, it contracts, eventually becoming denser than room air and sinking to the
floor. A properly designed heating system using natural convection, like this one, can heat a home quite efficiently.

FIGURE 1.25 Natural convection plays an important role in heat transfer inside this pot of water. Once conducted to the inside, heat
transfer to other parts of the pot is mostly by convection. The hotter water expands, decreases in density, and rises to transfer heat to other
regions of the water, while colder water sinks to the bottom. This process keeps repeating.

     INTERACTIVE

Natural convection like that of Figure 1.24 and Figure 1.25, but acting on rock in Earth's mantle, drives plate
tectonics (https://openstax.org/l/21platetecton) that are the motions that have shaped Earth's surface.

Convection is usually more complicated than conduction. Beyond noting that the convection rate is often
approximately proportional to the temperature difference, we will not do any quantitative work comparable to the
formula for conduction. However, we can describe convection qualitatively and relate convection rates to heat and
time. Air is a poor conductor, so convection dominates heat transfer by air. Therefore, the amount of available space
for airflow determines whether air transfers heat rapidly or slowly. There is little heat transfer in a space filled with
air with a small amount of other material that prevents flow. The space between the inside and outside walls of a
typical American house, for example, is about 9 cm (3.5 in.)--large enough for convection to work effectively. The
addition of wall insulation prevents airflow, so heat loss (or gain) is decreased. On the other hand, the gap between
the two panes of a double-paned window is about 1 cm, which largely prevents convection and takes advantage of
air's low conductivity reduce heat loss. Fur, cloth, and fiberglass also take advantage of the low conductivity of air by
trapping it in spaces too small to support convection (Figure 1.26).
40  1 · Temperature and Heat

    FIGURE 1.26 Fur is filled with air, breaking it up into many small pockets. Convection is very slow here, because the loops are so small. The
    low conductivity of air makes fur a very good lightweight insulator.

    Some interesting phenomena happen when convection is accompanied by a phase change. The combination allows
    us to cool off by sweating even if the temperature of the surrounding air exceeds body temperature. Heat from the
    skin is required for sweat to evaporate from the skin, but without air flow, the air becomes saturated and
    evaporation stops. Air flow caused by convection replaces the saturated air by dry air and evaporation continues.

    EXAMPLE 1.12

    Calculating the Flow of Mass during Convection

    The average person produces heat at the rate of about 120 W when at rest. At what rate must water evaporate from
    the body to get rid of all this energy? (For simplicity, we assume this evaporation occurs when a person is sitting in
    the shade and surrounding temperatures are the same as skin temperature, eliminating heat transfer by other
    methods.)

    Strategy                                             ). Thus, the energy loss per unit time is
    Energy is needed for this phase change (

    We divide both sides of the equation by to find that the mass evaporated per unit time is

    Significance
    Evaporating about 3 g/min seems reasonable. This would be about 180 g (about 7 oz.) per hour. If the air is very dry,
    the sweat may evaporate without even being noticed. A significant amount of evaporation also takes place in the
    lungs and breathing passages.

    Another important example of the combination of phase change and convection occurs when water evaporates from
    the oceans. Heat is removed from the ocean when water evaporates. If the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets

as clouds form, possibly far from the ocean, heat is released in the atmosphere. Thus, there is an overall transfer of
heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. This process is the driving power behind thunderheads, those great
cumulus clouds that rise as much as 20.0 km into the stratosphere (Figure 1.27). Water vapor carried in by
convection condenses, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. This energy causes the air to expand and rise to
colder altitudes. More condensation occurs in these regions, which in turn drives the cloud even higher. This
mechanism is an example of positive feedback, since the process reinforces and accelerates itself. It sometimes
produces violent storms, with lightning and hail. The same mechanism drives hurricanes.

Explain why using a fan in the summer feels refreshing.

Radiation

You can feel the heat transfer from the Sun. The space between Earth and the Sun is largely empty, so the Sun
warms us without any possibility of heat transfer by convection or conduction. Similarly, you can sometimes tell that
the oven is hot without touching its door or looking inside--it may just warm you as you walk by. In these examples,
heat is transferred by radiation (Figure 1.28). That is, the hot body emits electromagnetic waves that are absorbed
by the skin. No medium is required for electromagnetic waves to propagate. Different names are used for
electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light,
ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.
42  1 · Temperature and Heat

    FIGURE 1.28 Most of the heat transfer from this fire to the observers occurs through infrared radiation. The visible light, although dramatic,
    transfers relatively little thermal energy. Convection transfers energy away from the observers as hot air rises, while conduction is negligibly
    slow here. Skin is very sensitive to infrared radiation, so you can sense the presence of a fire without looking at it directly. (credit: Daniel
    O'Neil)

    The energy of electromagnetic radiation varies over a wide range, depending on the wavelength: A shorter
    wavelength (or higher frequency) corresponds to a higher energy. Because more heat is radiated at higher
    temperatures, higher temperatures produce more intensity at every wavelength but especially at shorter
    wavelengths. In visible light, wavelength determines color--red has the longest wavelength and violet the
    shortest--so a temperature change is accompanied by a color change. For example, an electric heating element on a
    stove glows from red to orange, while the higher-temperature steel in a blast furnace glows from yellow to white.
    Infrared radiation is the predominant form radiated by objects cooler than the electric element and the steel. The
    radiated energy as a function of wavelength depends on its intensity, which is represented in Figure 1.29 by the
    height of the distribution. (Electromagnetic Waves explains more about the electromagnetic spectrum, and Photons
    and Matter Waves (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/6-introduction) discusses why
    the decrease in wavelength corresponds to an increase in energy.)

    FIGURE 1.29 (a) A graph of the spectrum of electromagnetic waves emitted from an ideal radiator at three different temperatures. The
    intensity or rate of radiation emission increases dramatically with temperature, and the spectrum shifts down in wavelength toward the
    visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. The shaded portion denotes the visible part of the spectrum. It is apparent that the shift
    toward the ultraviolet with temperature makes the visible appearance shift from red to white to blue as temperature increases. (b) Note the
    variations in color corresponding to variations in flame temperature.

    The rate of heat transfer by radiation also depends on the object's color. Black is the most effective, and white is the
    least effective. On a clear summer day, black asphalt in a parking lot is hotter than adjacent gray sidewalk, because
    black absorbs better than gray (Figure 1.30). The reverse is also true--black radiates better than gray. Thus, on a
    clear summer night, the asphalt is colder than the gray sidewalk, because black radiates the energy more rapidly

than gray. A perfectly black object would be an ideal radiator and an ideal absorber, as it would capture all the

radiation that falls on it. In contrast, a perfectly white object or a perfect mirror would reflect all radiation, and a

perfectly transparent object would transmit it all (Figure 1.31). Such objects would not emit any radiation.

Mathematically, the color is represented by the emissivity e. A "blackbody" radiator would have an      , whereas

a perfect reflector or transmitter would have  . For real examples, tungsten light bulb filaments have an e of

about 0.5, and carbon black (a material used in printer toner) has an emissivity of about 0.95.

FIGURE 1.30 The darker pavement is hotter than the lighter pavement (much more of the ice on the right has melted), although both have
been in the sunlight for the same time. The thermal conductivities of the pavements are the same.

FIGURE 1.31 A black object is a good absorber and a good radiator, whereas a white, clear, or silver object is a poor absorber and a poor
radiator.

To see that, consider a silver object and a black object that can exchange heat by radiation and are in thermal
equilibrium. We know from experience that they will stay in equilibrium (the result of a principle that will be
discussed at length in Second Law of Thermodynamics). For the black object's temperature to stay constant, it must
emit as much radiation as it absorbs, so it must be as good at radiating as absorbing. Similar considerations show
that the silver object must radiate as little as it absorbs. Thus, one property, emissivity, controls both radiation and
absorption.

Finally, the radiated heat is proportional to the object's surface area, since every part of the surface radiates. If you
knock apart the coals of a fire, the radiation increases noticeably due to an increase in radiating surface area.

The rate of heat transfer by emitted radiation is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law of radiation:

where  is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, a combination of fundamental constants

of nature; A is the surface area of the object; and T is its temperature in kelvins.

The proportionality to the fourth power of the absolute temperature is a remarkably strong temperature
44  1 · Temperature and Heat

    dependence. It allows the detection of even small temperature variations. Images called thermographs can be used
    medically to detect regions of abnormally high temperature in the body, perhaps indicative of disease. Similar
    techniques can be used to detect heat leaks in homes (Figure 1.32), optimize performance of blast furnaces,
    improve comfort levels in work environments, and even remotely map Earth's temperature profile.

    FIGURE 1.32 A thermograph of part of a building shows temperature variations, indicating where heat transfer to the outside is most
    severe. Windows are a major region of heat transfer to the outside of homes. (credit: US Army)

    The Stefan-Boltzmann equation needs only slight refinement to deal with a simple case of an object's absorption of
    radiation from its surroundings. Assuming that an object with a temperature is surrounded by an environment
    with uniform temperature , the net rate of heat transfer by radiation is

                                                                                                                                                         1.10

    where e is the emissivity of the object alone. In other words, it does not matter whether the surroundings are white,

    gray, or black: The balance of radiation into and out of the object depends on how well it emits and absorbs

    radiation. When           the quantity is positive (and when    the quantity is negative), that is, the

    net heat transfer is from hot to cold.

    Before doing an example, we have a complication to discuss: different emissivities at different wavelengths. If the
    fraction of incident radiation an object reflects is the same at all visible wavelengths, the object is gray; if the
    fraction depends on the wavelength, the object has some other color. For instance, a red or reddish object reflects
    red light more strongly than other visible wavelengths. Because it absorbs less red, it radiates less red when hot.
    Differential reflection and absorption of wavelengths outside the visible range have no effect on what we see, but
    they may have physically important effects. Skin is a very good absorber and emitter of infrared radiation, having an
    emissivity of 0.97 in the infrared spectrum. Thus, in spite of the obvious variations in skin color, we are all nearly
    black in the infrared. This high infrared emissivity is why we can so easily feel radiation on our skin. It is also the
    basis for the effectiveness of night-vision scopes used by law enforcement and the military to detect human beings.

Significance

This value is a significant rate of heat transfer to the environment (note the minus sign), considering that a person at
rest may produce energy at the rate of 125 W and that conduction and convection are also transferring energy to the
environment. Indeed, we would probably expect this person to feel cold. Clothing significantly reduces heat transfer
to the environment by all mechanisms, because clothing slows down both conduction and convection, and has a
lower emissivity (especially if it is light-colored) than skin.

The average temperature of Earth is the subject of much current discussion. Earth is in radiative contact with both
the Sun and dark space, so we cannot use the equation for an environment at a uniform temperature. Earth receives
almost all its energy from radiation of the Sun and reflects some of it back into outer space. Conversely, dark space
is very cold, about 3 K, so that Earth radiates energy into the dark sky. The rate of heat transfer from soil and grasses
can be so rapid that frost may occur on clear summer evenings, even in warm latitudes.

The average temperature of Earth is determined by its energy balance. To a first approximation, it is the temperature
at which Earth radiates heat to space as fast as it receives energy from the Sun.

An important parameter in calculating the temperature of Earth is its emissivity (e). On average, it is about 0.65, but
calculation of this value is complicated by the great day-to-day variation in the highly reflective cloud coverage.
Because clouds have lower emissivity than either oceans or land masses, they emit some of the radiation back to
the surface, greatly reducing heat transfer into dark space, just as they greatly reduce heat transfer into the
atmosphere during the day. There is negative feedback (in which a change produces an effect that opposes that
change) between clouds and heat transfer; higher temperatures evaporate more water to form more clouds, which
reflect more radiation back into space, reducing the temperature.

The often-mentioned greenhouse effect is directly related to the variation of Earth's emissivity with wavelength

(Figure 1.33). The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon responsible for providing temperatures suitable for

life on Earth and for making Venus unsuitable for human life. Most of the infrared radiation emitted from Earth is

absorbed by carbon dioxide ( ) and water ( ) in the atmosphere and then re-radiated into outer space or

back to Earth. Re-radiation back to Earth maintains its surface temperature about  higher than it would be if

there were no atmosphere. (The glass walls and roof of a greenhouse increase the temperature inside by blocking

convective heat losses, not radiative losses.)

The greenhouse effect and its causes were first predicted by Eunice Newton Foote after she designed and
conducted experiments on heating of different gases. After filling flasks with carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and regular
air, then also modifying moisture, she placed them in the sun and carefully measured their heating and, especially,
their heat retention. She discovered that the CO2 flask gained the most temperature and held it the longest. After
subsequent research, her paper "Circumstances affecting the Heat of the Sun's Rays" included conclusions that an
atmosphere consisting of more carbon dioxide would be hotter resulting from the gas trapping radiation.

    re-emits it. Since Earth's temperature is much lower than the Sun's, it re-emits the energy at much longer wavelengths, in the infrared. The
    atmosphere absorbs much of that infrared radiation and radiates about half of the energy back down, keeping Earth warmer than it would
    otherwise be. The amount of trapping depends on concentrations of trace gases such as carbon dioxide, and an increase in the
    concentration of these gases increases Earth's surface temperature.

    The greenhouse effect is central to the discussion of global warming due to emission of carbon dioxide and methane
    (and other greenhouse gases) into Earth's atmosphere from industry, transportation, and farming. Changes in global
    climate could lead to more intense storms, precipitation changes (affecting agriculture), reduction in rain forest
    biodiversity, and rising sea levels.

         INTERACTIVE

    You can explore a simulation of the greenhouse effect (https://openstax.org/l/21simgreeneff) that takes the point of
    view that the atmosphere scatters (redirects) infrared radiation rather than absorbing it and reradiating it. You may
    want to run the simulation first with no greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and then look at how adding
    greenhouse gases affects the infrared radiation from the Earth and the Earth's temperature.

    PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

    Effects of Heat Transfer

      1. Examine the situation to determine what type of heat transfer is involved.
      2. Identify the type(s) of heat transfer--conduction, convection, or radiation.
      3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful.
      4. Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).
      5. Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown).

    6. For conduction, use the equation         . Table 1.5 lists thermal conductivities. For convection, determine

    the amount of matter moved and the equation  , along with  or  if a substance

    changes phase. For radiation, the equation   gives the net heat transfer rate.

    7. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions

INTRODUCTION Gases are literally all around us--the air that we breathe is a mixture of gases. Other gases include
those that make breads and cakes soft, those that make drinks fizzy, and those that burn to heat many homes.
Engines and refrigerators depend on the behaviors of gases, as we will see in later chapters.
As we discussed in the preceding chapter, the study of heat and temperature is part of an area of physics known as
thermodynamics, in which we require a system to be macroscopic, that is, to consist of a huge number (such as

      ) of molecules. We begin by considering some macroscopic properties of gases: volume, pressure, and
temperature. The simple model of a hypothetical "ideal gas" describes these properties of a gas very accurately
under many conditions. We move from the ideal gas model to a more widely applicable approximation, called the
Van der Waals model.
To understand gases even better, we must also look at them on the microscopic scale of molecules. In gases, the
molecules interact weakly, so the microscopic behavior of gases is relatively simple, and they serve as a good
introduction to systems of many molecules. The molecular model of gases is called the kinetic theory of gases and is
one of the classic examples of a molecular model that explains everyday behavior.

    2.1 Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Apply the ideal gas law to situations involving the pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of
            molecules of a gas

        · Use the unit of moles in relation to numbers of molecules, and molecular and macroscopic masses
        · Explain the ideal gas law in terms of moles rather than numbers of molecules
        · Apply the van der Waals gas law to situations where the ideal gas law is inadequate

    In this section, we explore the thermal behavior of gases. Our word "gas" comes from the Flemish word meaning
    "chaos," first used for vapors by the seventeenth-century chemist J. B. van Helmont. The term was more
    appropriate than he knew, because gases consist of molecules moving and colliding with each other at random. This
    randomness makes the connection between the microscopic and macroscopic domains simpler for gases than for
    liquids or solids.

    How do gases differ from solids and liquids? Under ordinary conditions, such as those of the air around us, the
    difference is that the molecules of gases are much farther apart than those of solids and liquids. Because the typical
    distances between molecules are large compared to the size of a molecule, as illustrated in Figure 2.2, the forces
    between them are considered negligible, except when they come into contact with each other during collisions.
    Also, at temperatures well above the boiling temperature, the motion of molecules is fast, and the gases expand
    rapidly to occupy all of the accessible volume. In contrast, in liquids and solids, molecules are closer together, and
    the behavior of molecules in liquids and solids is highly constrained by the molecules' interactions with one another.
    The macroscopic properties of such substances depend strongly on the forces between the molecules, and since
    many molecules are interacting, the resulting "many-body problems" can be extremely complicated (see
    Condensed Matter Physics (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/9-introduction)).

    FIGURE 2.2 Atoms and molecules in a gas are typically widely separated. Because the forces between them are quite weak at these
    distances, the properties of a gas depend more on the number of atoms per unit volume and on temperature than on the type of atom.

    The Gas Laws

    In the previous chapter, we saw one consequence of the large intermolecular spacing in gases: Gases are easily
    compressed. Table 1.2 shows that gases have larger coefficients of volume expansion than either solids or liquids.
    These large coefficients mean that gases expand and contract very rapidly with temperature changes. We also saw
    (in the section on thermal expansion) that most gases expand at the same rate or have the same coefficient of
    volume expansion, . This raises a question: Why do all gases act in nearly the same way, when all the various
    liquids and solids have widely varying expansion rates?
    To study how the pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas relate to one another, consider what happens when
    you pump air into a deflated car tire. The tire's volume first increases in direct proportion to the amount of air
    injected, without much increase in the tire pressure. Once the tire has expanded to nearly its full size, the tire's walls
    limit its volume expansion. If we continue to pump air into the tire, the pressure increases. When the car is driven
    and the tires flex, their temperature increases, and therefore the pressure increases even further (Figure 2.3).

FIGURE 2.3 (a) When air is pumped into a deflated tire, its volume first increases without much increase in pressure. (b) When the tire is
filled to a certain point, the tire walls resist further expansion, and the pressure increases with more air. (c) Once the tire is inflated, its
pressure increases with temperature.

Figure 2.4 shows data from the experiments of Robert Boyle (1627-1691), illustrating what is now called Boyle's
law: At constant temperature and number of molecules, the absolute pressure of a gas and its volume are inversely
proportional. (Recall from Fluid Mechanics (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/
14-introduction) that the absolute pressure is the true pressure and the gauge pressure is the absolute pressure
minus the ambient pressure, typically atmospheric pressure.) The graph in Figure 2.4 displays this relationship as an
inverse proportionality of volume to pressure.

FIGURE 2.4 Robert Boyle and his assistant found that volume and pressure are inversely proportional. Here their data are plotted as V
versus 1/p; the linearity of the graph shows the inverse proportionality. The number shown as the volume is actually the height in inches of
air in a cylindrical glass tube. The actual volume was that height multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the tube, which Boyle did not
publish. The data are from Boyle's book A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air..., p. 60.1

Figure 2.5 shows experimental data illustrating what is called Charles's law, after Jacques Charles (1746-1823).
Charles's law states that at constant pressure and number of molecules, the volume of a gas is proportional to its
absolute temperature.

66  2 · The Kinetic Theory of Gases

    FIGURE 2.5 Experimental data showing that at constant pressure, volume is approximately proportional to temperature. The best-fit line
    passes approximately through the origin.2

    Similar is Amonton's or Gay-Lussac's law, which states that at constant volume and number of molecules, the
    pressure is proportional to the temperature. That law is the basis of the constant-volume gas thermometer,
    discussed in the previous chapter. (The histories of these laws and the appropriate credit for them are more
    complicated than can be discussed here.)
    It is known experimentally that for gases at low density (such that their molecules occupy a negligible fraction of the
    total volume) and at temperatures well above the boiling point, these proportionalities hold to a good
    approximation. Not surprisingly, with the other quantities held constant, either pressure or volume is proportional to
    the number of molecules. More surprisingly, when the proportionalities are combined into a single equation, the
    constant of proportionality is independent of the composition of the gas. The resulting equation for all gases applies
    in the limit of low density and high temperature; it's the same for oxygen as for helium or uranium hexafluoride. A
    gas at that limit is called an ideal gas; it obeys the ideal gas law, which is also called the equation of state of an
    ideal gas.

      IDEAL GAS LAW

      The ideal gas law states that
                                                                                                                                                        2.1

      where p is the absolute pressure of a gas, V is the volume it occupies, N is the number of molecules in the gas,
      and T is its absolute temperature.

    The constant is called the Boltzmann constant in honor of the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann
    (1844-1906) and has the value

    The ideal gas law describes the behavior of any real gas when its density is low enough or its temperature high
    enough that it is far from liquefaction. This encompasses many practical situations. In the next section, we'll see
    why it's independent of the type of gas.
    In many situations, the ideal gas law is applied to a sample of gas with a constant number of molecules; for
    instance, the gas may be in a sealed container. If N is constant, then solving for N shows that pV /T is constant. We

where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to any two states of the gas at different times. Again, the temperature must be
expressed in kelvin and the pressure must be absolute pressure, which is the sum of gauge pressure and
atmospheric pressure.

       EXAMPLE 2.1

Calculating Pressure Changes Due to Temperature Changes

Suppose your bicycle tire is fully inflated, with an absolute pressure of       (a gauge pressure of just

under               ) at a temperature of    What is the pressure after its temperature has risen to       on a

hot day? Assume there are no appreciable leaks or changes in volume.

Strategy

The pressure in the tire is changing only because of changes in temperature. We know the initial pressure

                    the initial temperature  and the final temperature                  We must find

the final pressure  Since the number of molecules is constant, we can use the equation

Since the volume is constant, and are the same and they divide out. Therefore,
We can then rearrange this to solve for

where the temperature must be in kelvin.
Solution

  1. Convert temperatures from degrees Celsius to kelvin

  2. Substitute the known values into the equation,

Significance
The final temperature is about greater than the original temperature, so the final pressure is about greater as
well. Note that absolute pressure (see Fluid Mechanics (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/
pages/14-introduction)) and absolute temperature (see Temperature and Heat) must be used in the ideal gas law.

        EXAMPLE 2.2
Calculating the Number of Molecules in a Cubic Meter of Gas

How many molecules are in a typical object, such as gas in a tire or water in a glass? This calculation can give us an
idea of how large N typically is. Let's calculate the number of molecules in the air that a typical healthy young adult

    Because pressure, volume, and temperature are all specified, we can use the ideal gas law,

    Solution

    1. Identify the knowns.

    2. Substitute the known values into the equation and solve for N.

    Significance

    N is huge, even in small volumes. For example,  of a gas at STP contains                    molecules. Once again,

    note that our result for N is the same for all types of gases, including mixtures.

    As we observed in the chapter on fluid mechanics, pascals are      , so                     Thus, our result for N

    is dimensionless, a pure number that could be obtained by counting (in principle) rather than measuring. As it is the

    number of molecules, we put "molecules" after the number, keeping in mind that it is an aid to communication

    rather than a unit.

    Moles and Avogadro's Number

    It is often convenient to measure the amount of substance with a unit on a more human scale than molecules. The

    SI unit for this purpose was developed by the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro (1776-1856). (He worked from the

    hypothesis that equal volumes of gas at equal pressure and temperature contain equal numbers of molecules,

    independent of the type of gas. As mentioned above, this hypothesis has been confirmed when the ideal gas

    approximation applies.) A mole (abbreviated mol) is defined as the amount of any substance that contains as many

    molecules as there are atoms. (Technically, we should say "formula units," not "molecules," but this distinction is

    irrelevant for our purposes.) The number of molecules in one mole is called Avogadro's number  and the

    value of Avogadro's number is now known to be

    We can now write                 , where n represents the number of moles of a substance.

    Avogadro's number relates the mass of an amount of substance in grams to the number of protons and neutrons in

    an atom or molecule (12 for a carbon-12 atom), which roughly determine its mass. It's natural to define a unit of

    mass such that the mass of an atom is approximately equal to its number of neutrons and protons. The unit of that

    kind accepted for use with the SI is the unified atomic mass unit (u), also called the dalton. Specifically, a carbon-12

    atom has a mass of exactly 12 u, so that its molar mass M in grams per mole is numerically equal to the mass of one

    carbon-12 atom in u. That equality holds for any substance. In other words, is not only the conversion from

    numbers of molecules to moles, but it is also the conversion from u to grams:                  See Figure 2.6.

The Ideal Gas Law Restated using Moles

A very common expression of the ideal gas law uses the number of moles in a sample, n, rather than the number of
molecules, N. We start from the ideal gas law,

and multiply and divide the right-hand side of the equation by Avogadro's number  This gives us

You can use whichever value of R is most convenient for a particular problem.

EXAMPLE 2.3

Density of Air at STP and in a Hot Air Balloon

Calculate the density of dry air (a) under standard conditions and (b) in a hot air balloon at a temperature of    .

Dry air is approximately           and              .

Strategy and Solution

a. We are asked to find the density, or mass per cubic meter. We can begin by finding the molar mass. If we have
     a hundred molecules, of which 78 are nitrogen, 21 are oxygen, and 1 is argon, the average molecular mass is

                          , or the mass of each constituent multiplied by its percentage. The same applies to the
70  2 · The Kinetic Theory of Gases

    molar mass, which therefore is

    Now we can find the number of moles per cubic meter. We use the ideal gas law in terms of moles,

                  with                ,   ,  , and                                         . The most convenient choice

    for R in this case is                 because the known quantities are in SI units:

    Then, the mass of that air is
    Finally the density of air at STP is

    b. The air pressure inside the balloon is still 1 atm because the bottom of the balloon is open to the atmosphere.

    The calculation is the same except that we use a temperature of  , which is 393 K. We can repeat the

    calculation in (a), or simply observe that the density is proportional to the number of moles, which is inversely

    proportional to the temperature. Then using the subscripts 1 for air at STP and 2 for the hot air, we have

    Significance

    Using the methods of Archimedes' Principle and Buoyancy (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/

    pages/14-4-archimedes-principle-and-buoyancy), we can find that the net force on       of air at           is

                                             or enough to lift about 867 kg. The mass density and

    molar density of air at STP, found above, are often useful numbers. From the molar density, we can easily determine

    another useful number, the volume of a mole of any ideal gas at STP, which is 22.4 L.

         CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 2.3

    Liquids and solids have densities on the order of 1000 times greater than gases. Explain how this implies that the
    distances between molecules in gases are on the order of 10 times greater than the size of their molecules.

    The ideal gas law is closely related to energy: The units on both sides of the equation are joules. The right-hand side

    of the ideal gas law equation is      This term is roughly the total translational kinetic energy (which, when

    discussing gases, refers to the energy of translation of a molecule, not that of vibration of its atoms or rotation) of N

    molecules at an absolute temperature T, as we will see formally in the next section. The left-hand side of the ideal

    gas law equation is pV. As mentioned in the example on the number of molecules in an ideal gas, pressure

    multiplied by volume has units of energy. The energy of a gas can be changed when the gas does work as it

    increases in volume, something we explored in the preceding chapter, and the amount of work is related to the

    pressure. This is the process that occurs in gasoline or steam engines and turbines, as we'll see in the next chapter.

            PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

    The Ideal Gas Law

    Step 1. Examine the situation to determine that an ideal gas is involved. Most gases are nearly ideal unless they are
    close to the boiling point or at pressures far above atmospheric pressure.

    Step 2. Make a list of what quantities are given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the known
    quantities).

    Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                    2.1 · Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas  71

Step 3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknown quantities). A written list
is useful.

Step 4. Determine whether the number of molecules or the number of moles is known or asked for to decide

whether to use the ideal gas law as  where N is the number of molecules, or                 where n is

the number of moles.

Step 5. Convert known values into proper SI units (K for temperature, Pa for pressure, for volume, molecules for
N, and moles for n). If the units of the knowns are consistent with one of the non-SI values of R, you can leave them
in those units. Be sure to use absolute temperature and absolute pressure.

Step 6. Solve the ideal gas law for the quantity to be determined (the unknown quantity). You may need to take a
ratio of final states to initial states to eliminate the unknown quantities that are kept fixed.

Step 7. Substitute the known quantities, along with their units, into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical
solutions complete with units.

Step 8. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense?

The Van der Waals Equation of State

We have repeatedly noted that the ideal gas law is an approximation. How can it be improved upon? The van der
Waals equation of state (named after the Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals, 1837-1923) improves it by
taking into account two factors. First, the attractive forces between molecules, which are stronger at higher density
and reduce the pressure, are taken into account by adding to the pressure a term equal to the square of the molar
density multiplied by a positive coefficient a. Second, the volume of the molecules is represented by a positive
constant b, which can be thought of as the volume of a mole of molecules. This is subtracted from the total volume
to give the remaining volume that the molecules can move in. The constants a and b are determined experimentally
for each gas. The resulting equation is

                                                                                                              2.4

In the limit of low density (small n), the a and b terms are negligible, and we have the ideal gas law, as we should for

low density. On the other hand, if   is small, meaning that the molecules are very close together, the pressure

must be higher to give the same nRT, as we would expect in the situation of a highly compressed gas. However, the

increase in pressure is less than that argument would suggest, because at high density the  term is

significant. Since it's positive, it causes a lower pressure to give the same nRT.

The van der Waals equation of state works well for most gases under a wide variety of conditions. As we'll see in the
next module, it even predicts the gas-liquid transition.

pV Diagrams

We can examine aspects of the behavior of a substance by plotting a pV diagram, which is a graph of pressure

versus volume. When the substance behaves like an ideal gas, the ideal gas law              describes the

relationship between its pressure and volume. On a pV diagram, it's common to plot an isotherm, which is a curve

showing p as a function of V with the number of molecules and the temperature fixed. Then, for an ideal gas,

            For example, the volume of the gas decreases as the pressure increases. The resulting graph is a

hyperbola.

However, if we assume the van der Waals equation of state, the isotherms become more interesting, as shown in
Figure 2.7. At high temperatures, the curves are approximately hyperbolas, representing approximately ideal
behavior at various fixed temperatures. At lower temperatures, the curves look less and less like hyperbolas--that
is, the gas is not behaving ideally. There is a critical temperature at which the curve has a point with zero slope.
Below that temperature, the curves do not decrease monotonically; instead, they each have a "hump," meaning that
for a certain range of volume, increasing the volume increases the pressure.

    temperature and the blue curves at temperatures below it. The blue curves have an oscillation in which volume (V) increases with
    increasing pressure (P), an impossible situation, so they must be corrected as in Figure 2.8. (credit: "Eman"/Wikimedia Commons)

    Such behavior would be completely unphysical. Instead, the curves are understood as describing a liquid-gas phase
    transition. The oscillating part of the curve is replaced by a horizontal line, showing that as the volume increases at
    constant temperature, the pressure stays constant. That behavior corresponds to boiling and condensation; when a
    substance is at its boiling temperature for a particular pressure, it can increase in volume as some of the liquid turns
    to gas, or decrease as some of the gas turns to liquid, without any change in temperature or pressure.
    Figure 2.8 shows similar isotherms that are more realistic than those based on the van der Waals equation. The
    steep parts of the curves to the left of the transition region show the liquid phase, which is almost incompressible--a
    slight decrease in volume requires a large increase in pressure. The flat parts show the liquid-gas transition; the
    blue regions that they define represent combinations of pressure and volume where liquid and gas can coexist.

exists at a temperature below the boiling temperature.

The isotherms above do not go through the liquid-gas transition. Therefore, liquid cannot exist above that
temperature, which is the critical temperature (described in the chapter on temperature and heat). At sufficiently
low pressure above that temperature, the gas has the density of a liquid but will not condense; the gas is said to be
supercritical. At higher pressure, it is solid. Carbon dioxide, for example, has no liquid phase at a temperature above

          . The critical pressure is the maximum pressure at which the liquid can exist. The point on the pV diagram at
the critical pressure and temperature is the critical point (which you learned about in the chapter on temperature
and heat). Table 2.1 lists representative critical temperatures and pressures.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the relations between microscopic and macroscopic quantities in a gas
    · Solve problems involving mixtures of gases
    · Solve problems involving the distance and time between a gas molecule's collisions

We have examined pressure and temperature based on their macroscopic definitions. Pressure is the force divided
by the area on which the force is exerted, and temperature is measured with a thermometer. We can gain a better
understanding of pressure and temperature from the kinetic theory of gases, the theory that relates the
macroscopic properties of gases to the motion of the molecules they consist of. First, we make two assumptions
about molecules in an ideal gas.

1. There is a very large number N of molecules, all identical and each having mass m.
2. The molecules obey Newton's laws and are in continuous motion, which is random and isotropic, that is, the

     same in all directions.

To derive the ideal gas law and the connection between microscopic quantities such as the energy of a typical
molecule and macroscopic quantities such as temperature, we analyze a sample of an ideal gas in a rigid container,
about which we make two further assumptions:

3. The molecules are much smaller than the average distance between them, so their total volume is much less
     than that of their container (which has volume V). In other words, we take the Van der Waals constant b, the
74  2 · The Kinetic Theory of Gases

            volume of a mole of gas molecules, to be negligible compared to the volume of a mole of gas in the container.
      4. The molecules make perfectly elastic collisions with the walls of the container and with each other. Other

           forces on them, including gravity and the attractions represented by the Van der Waals constant a, are
            negligible (as is necessary for the assumption of isotropy).

    The collisions between molecules do not appear in the derivation of the ideal gas law. They do not disturb the
    derivation either, since collisions between molecules moving with random velocities give new random velocities.
    Furthermore, if the velocities of gas molecules in a container are initially not random and isotropic, molecular
    collisions are what make them random and isotropic.

    We make still further assumptions that simplify the calculations but do not affect the result. First, we let the
    container be a rectangular box. Second, we begin by considering monatomic gases, those whose molecules consist
    of single atoms, such as helium. Then, we can assume that the atoms have no energy except their translational
    kinetic energy; for instance, they have neither rotational nor vibrational energy. (Later, we discuss the validity of this
    assumption for real monatomic gases and dispense with it to consider diatomic and polyatomic gases.)

    Figure 2.9 shows a collision of a gas molecule with the wall of a container, so that it exerts a force on the wall (by
    Newton's third law). These collisions are the source of pressure in a gas. As the number of molecules increases, the
    number of collisions, and thus the pressure, increases. Similarly, if the average velocity of the molecules is higher,
    the gas pressure is higher.

    FIGURE 2.9 When a molecule collides with a rigid wall, the component of its momentum perpendicular to the wall is reversed. A force is
    thus exerted on the wall, creating pressure.

    In a sample of gas in a container, the randomness of the molecular motion causes the number of collisions of
    molecules with any part of the wall in a given time to fluctuate. However, because a huge number of molecules
    collide with the wall in a short time, the number of collisions on the scales of time and space we measure fluctuates
    by only a tiny, usually unobservable fraction from the average. We can compare this situation to that of a casino,
    where the outcomes of the bets are random and the casino's takings fluctuate by the minute and the hour. However,
    over long times such as a year, the casino's takings are very close to the averages expected from the odds. A tank of
    gas has enormously more molecules than a casino has bettors in a year, and the molecules make enormously more
    collisions in a second than a casino has bets.

    A calculation of the average force exerted by molecules on the walls of the box leads us to the ideal gas law and to
    the connection between temperature and molecular kinetic energy. (In fact, we will take two averages: one over
    time to get the average force exerted by one molecule with a given velocity, and then another average over
    molecules with different velocities.) This approach was developed by Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782), who is best

known in physics for his work on fluid flow (hydrodynamics). Remarkably, Bernoulli did this work before Dalton
established the view of matter as consisting of atoms.

Figure 2.10 shows a container full of gas and an expanded view of an elastic collision of a gas molecule with a wall of
the container, broken down into components. We have assumed that a molecule is small compared with the
separation of molecules in the gas, and that its interaction with other molecules can be ignored. Under these
conditions, the ideal gas law is experimentally valid. Because we have also assumed the wall is rigid and the
particles are points, the collision is elastic (by conservation of energy--there's nowhere for a particle's kinetic energy
to go). Therefore, the molecule's kinetic energy remains constant, and hence, its speed and the magnitude of its
momentum remain constant as well. This assumption is not always valid, but the results in the rest of this module
are also obtained in models that let the molecules exchange energy and momentum with the wall.

FIGURE 2.10 Gas in a box exerts an outward pressure on its walls. A molecule colliding with a rigid wall has its velocity and momentum in
the x-direction reversed. This direction is perpendicular to the wall. The components of its velocity momentum in the y- and z-directions
are not changed, which means there is no force parallel to the wall.

If the molecule's velocity changes in the x-direction, its momentum changes from  to      Thus, its change

in momentum is                    According to the impulse-momentum theorem given in the

chapter on linear momentum and collisions, the force exerted on the ith molecule, where i labels the molecules

from 1 to N, is given by

(In this equation alone, p represents momentum, not pressure.) There is no force between the wall and the

molecule except while the molecule is touching the wall. During the short time of the collision, the force between

the molecule and wall is relatively large, but that is not the force we are looking for. We are looking for the average

force, so we take to be the average time between collisions of the given molecule with this wall, which is the time

in which we expect to find one collision. Let l represent the length of the box in the x-direction. Then is the time

the molecule would take to go across the box and back, a distance 2l, at a speed of Thus  and the

expression for the force becomes

This force is due to one molecule. To find the total force on the wall, F, we need to add the contributions of all N
76  2 · The Kinetic Theory of Gases

    molecules:

    We now use the definition of the average, which we denote with a bar, to find the force:

    We want the force in terms of the speed v, rather than the x-component of the velocity. Note that the total velocity
    squared is the sum of the squares of its components, so that

    With the assumption of isotropy, the three averages on the right side are equal, so

    Substituting this into the expression for F gives

    The pressure is F/A, so we obtain

    where we used   for the volume. This gives the important result

                                                                                                              2.5

    Combining this equation with       gives

    We can get the average kinetic energy of a molecule,  , from the left-hand side of the equation by dividing out
    N and multiplying by 3/2.

    AVERAGE KINETIC ENERGY PER MOLECULE

    The average kinetic energy of a molecule is directly proportional to its absolute temperature:
                                                                                                                                                     2.6

    The equation    is the average kinetic energy per molecule. Note in particular that nothing in this equation

    depends on the molecular mass (or any other property) of the gas, the pressure, or anything but the temperature. If
    samples of helium and xenon gas, with very different molecular masses, are at the same temperature, the
    molecules have the same average kinetic energy.

    The internal energy of a thermodynamic system is the sum of the mechanical energies of all of the molecules in it.

    We can now give an equation for the internal energy of a monatomic ideal gas. In such a gas, the molecules' only

    energy is their translational kinetic energy. Therefore, denoting the internal energy by  we simply have

                or

Often we would like to use this equation in terms of moles:

We can solve       for a typical speed of a molecule in an ideal gas in terms of temperature to

determine what is known as the root-mean-square (rms) speed of a molecule.

RMS SPEED OF A MOLECULE

The root-mean-square (rms) speed of a molecule, or the square root of the average of the square of the
speed , is

                                                                                                                                                 2.8

The rms speed is not the average or the most likely speed of molecules, as we will see in Distribution of Molecular
Speeds, but it provides an easily calculated estimate of the molecules' speed that is related to their kinetic energy.
Again we can write this equation in terms of the gas constant R and the molar mass M in kg/mol:

                                                                                                                                                       2.9

We digress for a moment to answer a question that may have occurred to you: When we apply the model to atoms
instead of theoretical point particles, does rotational kinetic energy change our results? To answer this question, we
have to appeal to quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, rotational kinetic energy cannot take on just any
value; it's limited to a discrete set of values, and the smallest value is inversely proportional to the rotational inertia.
The rotational inertia of an atom is tiny because almost all of its mass is in the nucleus, which typically has a radius

less than          . Thus the minimum rotational energy of an atom is much more than          for any attainable

temperature, and the energy available is not enough to make an atom rotate. We will return to this point when
discussing diatomic and polyatomic gases in the next section.

table, we find

            temperature into the translational kinetic energy equation gives

    b. Substituting this mass and the value for into the equation for  yields

    Significance

    Note that the average kinetic energy of the molecule is independent of the type of molecule. The average
    translational kinetic energy depends only on absolute temperature. The kinetic energy is very small compared to
    macroscopic energies, so that we do not feel when an air molecule is hitting our skin. On the other hand, it is much
    greater than the typical difference in gravitational potential energy when a molecule moves from, say, the top to the
    bottom of a room, so our neglect of gravitation is justified in typical real-world situations. The rms speed of the
    nitrogen molecule is surprisingly large. These large molecular velocities do not yield macroscopic movement of air,
    since the molecules move in all directions with equal likelihood. The mean free path (the distance a molecule moves
    on average between collisions, discussed a bit later in this section) of molecules in air is very small, so the
    molecules move rapidly but do not get very far in a second. The high value for rms speed is reflected in the speed of
    sound, which is about 340 m/s at room temperature. The higher the rms speed of air molecules, the faster sound
    vibrations can be transferred through the air. The speed of sound increases with temperature and is greater in gases
    with small molecular masses, such as helium (see Figure 2.11).

    FIGURE 2.11 (a) In an ordinary gas, so many molecules move so fast that they collide billions of times every second. (b) Individual
    molecules do not move very far in a small amount of time, but disturbances like sound waves are transmitted at speeds related to the
    molecular speeds.

speed equal to the escape velocity?

Strategy
Identify the knowns and unknowns and determine which equations to use to solve the problem.

Solution

  1. Identify the knowns: v is the escape velocity, 11.1 km/s.

Significance

This temperature is much higher than atmospheric temperature, which is approximately 250 K
at high elevation. Very few helium atoms are left in the atmosphere, but many were present when the atmosphere
was formed, and more are always being created by radioactive decay (see the chapter on nuclear physics). The
reason for the loss of helium atoms is that a small number of helium atoms have speeds higher than Earth's escape
velocity even at normal temperatures. The speed of a helium atom changes from one collision to the next, so that at
any instant, there is a small but nonzero chance that the atom's speed is greater than the escape velocity. The
chance is high enough that over the lifetime of Earth, almost all the helium atoms that have been in the atmosphere
have reached escape velocity at high altitudes and escaped from Earth's gravitational pull. Heavier molecules, such
as oxygen, nitrogen, and water, have smaller rms speeds, and so it is much less likely that any of them will have
speeds greater than the escape velocity. In fact, the likelihood is so small that billions of years are required to lose
significant amounts of heavier molecules from the atmosphere. Figure 2.12 shows the effect of a lack of an
atmosphere on the Moon. Because the gravitational pull of the Moon is much weaker, it has lost almost its entire
atmosphere. The atmospheres of Earth and other bodies are compared in this chapter's exercises.

    taken at night with a large spotlight. In fact, the light is coming from the Sun. Because the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is so low
    (about 1/6 that of Earth), the Moon's escape velocity is much smaller. As a result, gas molecules escape very easily from the Moon, leaving
    it with virtually no atmosphere. Even during the daytime, the sky is black because there is no gas to scatter sunlight. (credit: Harrison H.

         CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 2.4

    If you consider a very small object, such as a grain of pollen, in a gas, then the number of molecules striking its
    surface would also be relatively small. Would you expect the grain of pollen to experience any fluctuations in
    pressure due to statistical fluctuations in the number of gas molecules striking it in a given amount of time?

    Vapor Pressure, Partial Pressure, and Dalton's Law

    The pressure a gas would create if it occupied the total volume available is called the gas's partial pressure. If two
    or more gases are mixed, they will come to thermal equilibrium as a result of collisions between molecules; the
    process is analogous to heat conduction as described in the chapter on temperature and heat. As we have seen from
    kinetic theory, when the gases have the same temperature, their molecules have the same average kinetic energy.
    Thus, each gas obeys the ideal gas law separately and exerts the same pressure on the walls of a container that it
    would if it were alone. Therefore, in a mixture of gases, the total pressure is the sum of partial pressures of the
    component gases, assuming ideal gas behavior and no chemical reactions between the components. This law is
    known as Dalton's law of partial pressures, after the English scientist John Dalton (1766-1844) who proposed it.
    Dalton's law is consistent with the fact that pressures add according to Pascal's principle.

    In a mixture of ideal gases in thermal equilibrium, the number of molecules of each gas is proportional to its partial

    pressure. This result follows from applying the ideal gas law to each in the form  Because the right-

    hand side is the same for any gas at a given temperature in a container of a given volume, the left-hand side is the

    same as well.

    · Partial pressure is the pressure a gas would create if it existed alone.
    · Dalton's law states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all of the gases present.
    · For any two gases (labeled 1 and 2) in equilibrium in a container,

    An important application of partial pressure is that, in chemistry, it functions as the concentration of a gas in
    determining the rate of a reaction. Here, we mention only that the partial pressure of oxygen in a person's lungs is
    crucial to life and health. Breathing air that has a partial pressure of oxygen below 0.16 atm can impair coordination

and judgment, particularly in people not acclimated to a high elevation. Lower partial pressures of have more
serious effects; partial pressures below 0.06 atm can be quickly fatal, and permanent damage is likely even if the
person is rescued. However, the sensation of needing to breathe, as when holding one's breath, is caused much
more by high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the blood than by low concentrations of oxygen. Thus, if a small
room or closet is filled with air having a low concentration of oxygen, perhaps because a leaking cylinder of some
compressed gas is stored there, a person will not feel any "choking" sensation and may go into convulsions or lose
consciousness without noticing anything wrong. Safety engineers give considerable attention to this danger.

Another important application of partial pressure is vapor pressure, which is the partial pressure of a vapor at which
it is in equilibrium with the liquid (or solid, in the case of sublimation) phase of the same substance. At any
temperature, the partial pressure of the water in the air cannot exceed the vapor pressure of the water at that
temperature, because whenever the partial pressure reaches the vapor pressure, water condenses out of the air.
Dew is an example of this condensation. The temperature at which condensation occurs for a sample of air is called
the dew point. It is easily measured by slowly cooling a metal ball; the dew point is the temperature at which
condensation first appears on the ball.

The vapor pressures of water at some temperatures of interest for meteorology are given in Table 2.2.

    As noted in the chapter on temperature and heat, the temperature seldom falls below the dew point, because when
    it reaches the dew point or frost point, water condenses and releases a relatively large amount of latent heat of
    vaporization.

    Mean Free Path and Mean Free Time

    We now consider collisions explicitly. The usual first step (which is all we'll take) is to calculate the mean free path,

    the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with other molecules, and the mean free time , the

    average time between the collisions of a molecule. If we assume all the molecules are spheres with a radius r, then

    a molecule will collide with another if their centers are within a distance 2r of each other. For a given particle, we say

    that the area of a circle with that radius,     , is the "cross-section" for collisions. As the particle moves, it traces a

    cylinder with that cross-sectional area. The mean free path is the length such that the expected number of other

    molecules in a cylinder of length and cross-section        is 1. If we temporarily ignore the motion of the molecules

    other than the one we're looking at, the expected number is the number density of molecules, N/V, times the

    volume, and the volume is         , so we have             or

    Taking the motion of all the molecules into account makes the calculation much harder, but the only change is a
    factor of The result is

                                                                                                                                                         2.10

2.3 Heat Capacity and Equipartition of Energy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Solve problems involving heat transfer to and from ideal monatomic gases whose volumes are held
        constant

    · Solve similar problems for non-monatomic ideal gases based on the number of degrees of freedom of a
        molecule

    · Estimate the heat capacities of metals using a model based on degrees of freedom

In the chapter on temperature and heat, we defined the specific heat capacity with the equation            or

          . However, the properties of an ideal gas depend directly on the number of moles in a sample, so

here we define specific heat capacity in terms of the number of moles, not the mass. Furthermore, when talking

about solids and liquids, we ignored any changes in volume and pressure with changes in temperature--a good

approximation for solids and liquids, but for gases, we have to make some condition on volume or pressure changes.

Here, we focus on the heat capacity with the volume held constant. We can calculate it for an ideal gas.

Heat Capacity of an Ideal Monatomic Gas at Constant Volume

We define the molar heat capacity at constant volume as

This is often expressed in the form

                                                                                                           2.13
84  2 · The Kinetic Theory of Gases

    If the volume does not change, there is no overall displacement, so no work is done, and the only change in internal

    energy is due to the heat flow          (This statement is discussed further in the next chapter.) We use the

    equation            to write            and substitute for Q to find                        , which gives

    the following simple result for an ideal monatomic gas:

    It is independent of temperature, which justifies our use of finite differences instead of a derivative. This formula
    agrees well with experimental results.

    In the next chapter we discuss the molar specific heat at constant pressure which is always greater than

    EXAMPLE 2.8

    Calculating Temperature

    A sample of 0.125 kg of xenon is contained in a rigid metal cylinder, big enough that the xenon can be modeled as an

    ideal gas, at a temperature of   . The cylinder is moved outside on a hot summer day. As the xenon comes into

    equilibrium by reaching the temperature of its surroundings, 180 J of heat are conducted to it through the cylinder

    walls. What is the equilibrium temperature? Ignore the expansion of the metal cylinder.

    Solution

    1. Identify the knowns: We know the initial temperature is    , the heat Q is 180 J, and the mass m of the

    xenon is 0.125 kg.

    2. Identify the unknown. We need the final temperature, so we'll need .

    3. Determine which equations are needed. Because xenon gas is monatomic, we can use         Then

    we need the number of moles,

    4. Substitute the known values into the equations and solve for the unknowns.

    The molar mass of xenon is 131.3 g, so we obtain

    Therefore, the final temperature is     . The problem could equally well be solved in kelvin; as a kelvin is

    the same size as a degree Celsius of temperature change, you would get

    Significance

    systems.

    Suppose 2 moles of helium gas at 200 K are mixed with 2 moles of krypton gas at 400 K in a calorimeter. What is the
    final temperature?

    We would like to generalize our results to ideal gases with more than one atom per molecule. In such systems, the
    molecules can have other forms of energy beside translational kinetic energy, such as rotational kinetic energy and
    vibrational kinetic and potential energies. We will see that a simple rule lets us determine the average energies
    present in these forms and solve problems in much the same way as we have for monatomic gases.

    Degrees of Freedom

    In the previous section, we found that                   and  , from which it follows that                             .

The same equation holds for and for . Thus, we can look at our energy of    as the sum of contributions of

       from each of the three dimensions of translational motion. Shifting to the gas as a whole, we see that the 3 in

the formula     also reflects those three dimensions. We define a degree of freedom as an independent

possible motion of a molecule, such as each of the three dimensions of translation. Then, letting d represent the
number of degrees of freedom, the molar heat capacity at constant volume of a monatomic ideal gas is

where        .

The branch of physics called statistical mechanics tells us, and experiment confirms, that of any ideal gas is
given by this equation, regardless of the number of degrees of freedom. This fact follows from a more general result,
the equipartition theorem, which holds in classical (non-quantum) thermodynamics for systems in thermal
equilibrium under technical conditions that are beyond our scope. Here, we mention only that in a system, the
energy is shared among the degrees of freedom by collisions.

EQUIPARTITION THEOREM

The energy of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is partitioned equally among its degrees of freedom.
Accordingly, the molar heat capacity of an ideal gas is proportional to its number of degrees of freedom, d:

                                                                                                                                                2.14

This result is due to the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879), whose name will appear several more
times in this book.

For example, consider a diatomic ideal gas (a good model for nitrogen, and oxygen,  Such a gas has more

degrees of freedom than a monatomic gas. In addition to the three degrees of freedom for translation, it has two

degrees of freedom for rotation perpendicular to its axis. Furthermore, the molecule can vibrate along its axis. This

motion is often modeled by imagining a spring connecting the two atoms, and we know from simple harmonic

motion that such motion has both kinetic and potential energy. Each of these forms of energy corresponds to a

degree of freedom, giving two more.

We might expect that for a diatomic gas, we should use 7 as the number of degrees of freedom; classically, if the

molecules of a gas had only translational kinetic energy, collisions between molecules would soon make them

rotate and vibrate. However, as explained in the previous module, quantum mechanics controls which degrees of

freedom are active. The result is shown in Figure 2.13. Both rotational and vibrational energies are limited to

discrete values. For temperatures below about 60 K, the energies of hydrogen molecules are too low for a collision

to bring the rotational state or vibrational state of a molecule from the lowest energy to the second lowest, so the

only form of energy is translational kinetic energy, and  or                as in a monatomic gas. Above that

temperature, the two rotational degrees of freedom begin to contribute, that is, some molecules are excited to the

rotational state with the second-lowest energy. (This temperature is much lower than that where rotations of

monatomic gases contribute, because diatomic molecules have much higher rotational inertias and hence much

lower rotational energies.) From about room temperature (a bit less than 300 K) to about 600 K, the rotational

degrees of freedom are fully active, but the vibrational ones are not, and  . Then, finally, above about 3000 K,

the vibrational degrees of freedom are fully active, and  as the classical theory predicted.

    Polyatomic molecules typically have one additional rotational degree of freedom at room temperature, since they

    have comparable moments of inertia around any axis. Thus, at room temperature, they have  At high

    temperatures, the number of degrees of freedom increases by 2 for each vibrational mode. We usually assume that

    gases have the theoretical room-temperature values of d.

    As shown in Table 2.3, the results agree well with experiments for many monatomic and diatomic gases, but the
    agreement for triatomic gases is only fair. The differences arise from interactions that we have ignored between and

What about internal energy for diatomic and polyatomic gases? For such gases, is a function of temperature
(Figure 2.13), so we do not have the kind of simple result we have for monatomic ideal gases.

Molar Heat Capacity of Solid Elements

The idea of equipartition leads to an estimate of the molar heat capacity of solid elements at ordinary temperatures.
We can model the atoms of a solid as attached to neighboring atoms by springs (Figure 2.14).

FIGURE 2.14 In a simple model of a solid element, each atom is attached to others by six springs, two for each possible motion: x, y, and z.
Each of the three motions corresponds to two degrees of freedom, one for kinetic energy and one for potential energy. Thus

Analogously to the discussion of vibration in the previous module, each atom has six degrees of freedom: one kinetic
and one potential for each of the x-, y-, and z-directions. Accordingly, the molar specific heat of a metal should be
3R. This result, known as the Law of Dulong and Petit, works fairly well experimentally at room temperature. (For
every element, it fails at low temperatures for quantum-mechanical reasons. Since quantum effects are particularly
important for low-mass particles, the Law of Dulong and Petit already fails at room temperature for some light
elements, such as beryllium and carbon. It also fails for some heavier elements for various reasons beyond what we
can cover.)

        PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Heat Capacity and Equipartition

The strategy for solving these problems is the same as the one in Phase Changes for the effects of heat transfer. The
only new feature is that you should determine whether the case just presented--ideal gases at constant
volume--applies to the problem. (For solid elements, looking up the specific heat capacity is generally better than
estimating it from the Law of Dulong and Petit.) In the case of an ideal gas, determine the number d of degrees of
freedom from the number of atoms in the gas molecule and use it to calculate (or use to solve for d).

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Describe the distribution of molecular speeds in an ideal gas
        · Find the average and most probable molecular speeds in an ideal gas

    Particles in an ideal gas all travel at relatively high speeds, but they do not travel at the same speed. The rms speed
    is one kind of average, but many particles move faster and many move slower. The actual distribution of speeds has
    several interesting implications for other areas of physics, as we will see in later chapters.

    The Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

    The motion of molecules in a gas is random in magnitude and direction for individual molecules, but a gas of many
    molecules has a predictable distribution of molecular speeds. This predictable distribution of molecular speeds is
    known as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, after its originators, who calculated it based on kinetic theory, and
    it has since been confirmed experimentally (Figure 2.15).

    To understand this figure, we must define a distribution function of molecular speeds, since with a finite number of
    molecules, the probability that a molecule will have exactly a given speed is 0.

    FIGURE 2.15 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular speeds in an ideal gas. The most likely speed is less than the rms speed

We define the distribution function  by saying that the expected number            of particles with speeds
between and is given by

[Since N is dimensionless, the unit of f(v) is seconds per meter.] We can write this equation conveniently in
differential form:

In this form, we can understand the equation as saying that the number of molecules with speeds between v and

is the total number of molecules in the sample times f(v) times dv. That is, the probability that a molecule's

speed is between v and   is f(v)dv.

We can now quote Maxwell's result, although the proof is beyond our scope.

MAXWELL-BOLTZMANN DISTRIBUTION OF SPEEDS

         INTERACTIVE

    With only a relatively small number of molecules, the distribution of speeds fluctuates around the Maxwell-
    Boltzmann distribution. However, you can view this simulation (https://openstax.org/l/21maxboltzdisim) to see the
    essential features that more massive molecules move slower and have a narrower distribution. Use the set-up "2
    Gases, Random Speeds". Note the display at the bottom comparing histograms of the speed distributions with the
    theoretical curves.

    We can use a probability distribution to calculate average values by multiplying the distribution function by the
    quantity to be averaged and integrating the product over all possible speeds. (This is analogous to calculating
    averages of discrete distributions, where you multiply each value by the number of times it occurs, add the results,
    and divide by the number of values. The integral is analogous to the first two steps, and the normalization is
    analogous to dividing by the number of values.) Thus the average velocity is

The peak speed provides a sometimes more convenient way to write the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function:

        PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Speed Distribution

Step 1. Examine the situation to determine that it relates to the distribution of molecular speeds.

Step 2. Make a list of what quantities are given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the known
quantities).

Step 3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknown quantities). A written list
is useful.

Step 4. Convert known values into proper SI units (K for temperature, Pa for pressure, for volume, molecules for
N, and moles for n). In many cases, though, using R and the molar mass will be more convenient than using and
the molecular mass.

Step 5. Determine whether you need the distribution function for velocity or the one for energy, and whether you are
using a formula for one of the characteristic speeds (average, most probably, or rms), finding a ratio of values of the
distribution function, or approximating an integral.

Step 6. Solve the appropriate equation for the ideal gas law for the quantity to be determined (the unknown
quantity). Note that if you are taking a ratio of values of the distribution function, the normalization factors divide
out. Or if approximating an integral, use the method asked for in the problem.

Step 7. Substitute the known quantities, along with their units, into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical
solutions complete with units.

We can now gain a qualitative understanding of a puzzle about the composition of Earth's atmosphere. Hydrogen is
by far the most common element in the universe, and helium is by far the second-most common. Moreover, helium
is constantly produced on Earth by radioactive decay. Why are those elements so rare in our atmosphere? The
answer is that gas molecules that reach speeds above Earth's escape velocity, about 11 km/s, can escape from the
atmosphere into space. Because of the lower mass of hydrogen and helium molecules, they move at higher speeds
than other gas molecules, such as nitrogen and oxygen. Only a few exceed escape velocity, but far fewer heavier
molecules do. Thus, over the billions of years that Earth has existed, far more hydrogen and helium molecules have
92  2 · The Kinetic Theory of Gases

    escaped from the atmosphere than other molecules, and hardly any of either is now present.

    We can also now take another look at evaporative cooling, which we discussed in the chapter on temperature and
    heat. Liquids, like gases, have a distribution of molecular energies. The highest-energy molecules are those that can
    escape from the intermolecular attractions of the liquid. Thus, when some liquid evaporates, the molecules left
    behind have a lower average energy, and the liquid has a lower temperature.

INTRODUCTION Heat is the transfer of energy due to a temperature difference between two systems. Heat

describes the process of converting from one form of energy into another. A car engine, for example, burns gasoline.

Heat is produced when the burned fuel is chemically transformed into mostly        and  which are gases at the

combustion temperature. These gases exert a force on a piston through a displacement, doing work and converting

the piston's kinetic energy into a variety of other forms--into the car's kinetic energy; into electrical energy to run the

spark plugs, radio, and lights; and back into stored energy in the car's battery.

Energy is conserved in all processes, including those associated with thermodynamic systems. The roles of heat
transfer and internal energy change vary from process to process and affect how work is done by the system in that
process. We will see that the first law of thermodynamics explains that a change in the internal energy of a system
comes from changes in heat or work. Understanding the laws that govern thermodynamic processes and the
relationship between the system and its surroundings is therefore paramount in gaining scientific knowledge of
energy and energy consumption.
104  3 · The First Law of Thermodynamics

     3.1 Thermodynamic Systems

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define a thermodynamic system, its boundary, and its surroundings
         · Explain the roles of all the components involved in thermodynamics
         · Define thermal equilibrium and thermodynamic temperature
         · Link an equation of state to a system

     A thermodynamic system includes anything whose thermodynamic properties are of interest. It is embedded in its
     surroundings or environment; it can exchange heat with, and do work on, its environment through a boundary,
     which is the imagined wall that separates the system and the environment (Figure 3.2). In reality, the immediate
     surroundings of the system are interacting with it directly and therefore have a much stronger influence on its
     behavior and properties. For example, if we are studying a car engine, the burning gasoline inside the cylinder of the
     engine is the thermodynamic system; the piston, exhaust system, radiator, and air outside form the surroundings of
     the system. The boundary then consists of the inner surfaces of the cylinder and piston.

     FIGURE 3.2 (a) A system, which can include any relevant process or value, is self-contained in an area. The surroundings may also have
     relevant information; however, the surroundings are important to study only if the situation is an open system. (b) The burning gasoline in
     the cylinder of a car engine is an example of a thermodynamic system.

     Normally, a system must have some interactions with its surroundings. A system is called an isolated and closed
     system if it is completely separated from its environment--for example, a gas that is surrounded by immovable and
     thermally insulating walls. In reality, a closed system does not exist unless the entire universe is treated as the
     system, or it is used as a model for an actual system that has minimal interactions with its environment. Most
     systems are known as an open system, which can exchange energy and/or matter with its surroundings (Figure 3.3).

When we examine a thermodynamic system, we ignore the difference in behavior from place to place inside the
system for a given moment. In other words, we concentrate on the macroscopic properties of the system, which are
the averages of the microscopic properties of all the molecules or entities in the system. Any thermodynamic system
is therefore treated as a continuum that has the same behavior everywhere inside. We assume the system is in
equilibrium. You could have, for example, a temperature gradient across the system. However, when we discuss a
thermodynamic system in this chapter, we study those that have uniform properties throughout the system.

Before we can carry out any study on a thermodynamic system, we need a fundamental characterization of the
system. When we studied a mechanical system, we focused on the forces and torques on the system, and their
balances dictated the mechanical equilibrium of the system. In a similar way, we should examine the heat transfer
between a thermodynamic system and its environment or between the different parts of the system, and its balance
should dictate the thermal equilibrium of the system. Intuitively, such a balance is reached if the temperature
becomes the same for different objects or parts of the system in thermal contact, and the net heat transfer over
time becomes zero.

Thus, when we say two objects (a thermodynamic system and its environment, for example) are in thermal

equilibrium, we mean that they are at the same temperature, as we discussed in Temperature and Heat. Let us

consider three objects at temperatures  and respectively. How do we know whether they are in thermal

equilibrium? The governing principle here is the zeroth law of thermodynamics, as described in Temperature and

Heat on temperature and heat:

If object 1 is in thermal equilibrium with objects 2 and 3, respectively, then objects 2 and 3 must also be in thermal
equilibrium.

Mathematically, we can simply write the zeroth law of thermodynamics as
                                                                                                                                                       3.1

This is the most fundamental way of defining temperature: Two objects must be at the same temperature
thermodynamically if the net heat transfer between them is zero when they are put in thermal contact and have
reached a thermal equilibrium.

The zeroth law of thermodynamics is equally applicable to the different parts of a closed system and requires that
the temperature everywhere inside the system be the same if the system has reached a thermal equilibrium. To
simplify our discussion, we assume the system is uniform with only one type of material--for example, water in a
tank. The measurable properties of the system at least include its volume, pressure, and temperature. The range of
specific relevant variables depends upon the system. For example, for a stretched rubber band, the relevant
variables would be length, tension, and temperature. The relationship between these three basic properties of the
system is called the equation of state of the system and is written symbolically for a closed system as
106  3 · The First Law of Thermodynamics

                                                                                                                        3.2

     where V, p, and T are the volume, pressure, and temperature of the system at a given condition.

     In principle, this equation of state exists for any thermodynamic system but is not always readily available. The

     forms of  for many materials have been determined either experimentally or theoretically. In the

     preceding chapter, we saw an example of an equation of state for an ideal gas,

     We have so far introduced several physical properties that are relevant to the thermodynamics of a thermodynamic
     system, such as its volume, pressure, and temperature. We can separate these quantities into two generic
     categories. The quantity associated with an amount of matter is an extensive variable, such as the volume and the
     number of moles. The other properties of a system are intensive variables, such as the pressure and temperature.
     An extensive variable doubles its value if the amount of matter in the system doubles, provided all the intensive
     variables remain the same. For example, the volume or total energy of the system doubles if we double the amount
     of matter in the system while holding the temperature and pressure of the system unchanged.

     3.2 Work, Heat, and Internal Energy

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the work done by a system, heat transfer between objects, and internal energy change of a
             system

         · Calculate the work, heat transfer, and internal energy change in a simple process

     We discussed the concepts of work and energy earlier in mechanics. Examples and related issues of heat transfer
     between different objects have also been discussed in the preceding chapters. Here, we want to expand these
     concepts to a thermodynamic system and its environment. Specifically, we elaborated on the concepts of heat and
     heat transfer in the previous two chapters. Here, we want to understand how work is done by or to a thermodynamic
     system; how heat is transferred between a system and its environment; and how the total energy of the system
     changes under the influence of the work done and heat transfer.

     Work Done by a System

     A force created from any source can do work by moving an object through a displacement. Then how does a
     thermodynamic system do work? Figure 3.4 shows a gas confined to a cylinder that has a movable piston at one
     end. If the gas expands against the piston, it exerts a force through a distance and does work on the piston. If the
     piston compresses the gas as it is moved inward, work is also done--in this case, on the gas. The work associated
     with such volume changes can be determined as follows: Let the gas pressure on the piston face be p. Then the
     force on the piston due to the gas is pA, where A is the area of the face. When the piston is pushed outward an
     infinitesimal distance dx, the magnitude of the work done by the gas is

     Since the change in volume of the gas is  this becomes

     For a finite change in volume from        we can integrate this equation from                                3.3

This integral is only meaningful for a quasi-static process, which means a process that takes place in infinitesimally
small steps, keeping the system at thermal equilibrium. (We examine this idea in more detail later in this chapter.)
Only then does a well-defined mathematical relationship (the equation of state) exist between the pressure and
volume. This relationship can be plotted on a pV diagram of pressure versus volume, where the curve is the change
of state. We can approximate such a process as one that occurs slowly, through a series of equilibrium states. The
integral is interpreted graphically as the area under the pV curve (the shaded area of Figure 3.5). Work done by the
gas is positive for expansion and negative for compression.

FIGURE 3.5 When a gas expands slowly from  the work done by the system is represented by the shaded area under the pV curve.

Consider the two processes involving an ideal gas that are represented by paths AC and ABC in Figure 3.6. The first

process is an isothermal expansion, with the volume of the gas changing its volume from  . This isothermal

process is represented by the curve between points A and C. The gas is kept at a constant temperature T by keeping

it in thermal equilibrium with a heat reservoir at that temperature. From Equation 3.4 and the ideal gas law,

      FIGURE 3.6 The paths ABC, AC, and ADC represent three different quasi-static transitions between the equilibrium states A and C.

The expansion is isothermal, so T remains constant over the entire process. Since n and R are also constant, the only

     variable in the integrand is V, so the work done by an ideal gas in an isothermal process is

     Notice that if            (expansion), W is positive, as expected.

     The straight lines from A to B and then from B to C represent a different process. Here, a gas at a pressure first

     expands isobarically (constant pressure) and quasi-statically from  , after which it cools quasi-statically at

     the constant volume until its pressure drops to . From A to B, the pressure is constant at p, so the work over

     this part of the path is

     From B to C, there is no change in volume and therefore no work is done. The net work over the path ABC is then

     A comparison of the expressions for the work done by the gas in the two processes of Figure 3.6 shows that they are
     quite different. This illustrates a very important property of thermodynamic work: It is path dependent. We cannot
     determine the work done by a system as it goes from one equilibrium state to another unless we know its
     thermodynamic path. Different values of the work are associated with different paths.

             EXAMPLE 3.1
     Isothermal Expansion of a van der Waals Gas

     Studies of a van der Waals gas require an adjustment to the ideal gas law that takes into consideration that gas
     molecules have a definite volume (see The Kinetic Theory of Gases). One mole of a van der Waals gas has an
     equation of state

     where a and b are two parameters for a specific gas. Suppose the gas expands isothermally and quasi-statically
     from volume to volume How much work is done by the gas during the expansion?
     Strategy
     Because the equation of state is given, we can use Equation 3.4 to express the pressure in terms of V and T.
     Furthermore, temperature T is a constant under the isothermal condition, so V becomes the only changing variable
     under the integral.
     Solution
     To evaluate this integral, we must express p as a function of V. From the given equation of state, the gas pressure is

     Because T is constant under the isothermal condition, the work done by 1 mol of a van der Waals gas in expanding
     from a volume to a volume is thus

By taking into account the volume of molecules, the expression for work is much more complex. If, however, we set

and           we see that the expression for work matches exactly the work done by an isothermal process for

one mole of an ideal gas.

Internal Energy

The internal energy of a thermodynamic system is, by definition, the sum of the mechanical energies of all the
molecules or entities in the system. If the kinetic and potential energies of molecule i are and respectively,
then the internal energy of the system is the average of the total mechanical energy of all the entities:

                                                                                                                                                       3.5

where the summation is over all the molecules of the system, and the bars over K and U indicate average values. The

kinetic energy of an individual molecule includes contributions due to its rotation and vibration, as well as its

translational energy       where is the molecule's speed measured relative to the center of mass of the

system. The potential energy is associated only with the interactions between molecule i and the other

molecules of the system. In fact, neither the system's location nor its motion is of any consequence as far as the

internal energy is concerned. The internal energy of the system is not affected by moving it from the basement to

the roof of a 100-story building or by placing it on a moving train.

In an ideal monatomic gas, each molecule is a single atom. Consequently, there is no rotational or vibrational kinetic

energy and                 . Furthermore, there are no interatomic interactions (collisions notwithstanding), so

              , which we set to zero. The internal energy is therefore due to translational kinetic energy only and

From the discussion in the preceding chapter, we know that the average kinetic energy of a molecule in an ideal
monatomic gas is

where T is the Kelvin temperature of the gas. Consequently, the average mechanical energy per molecule of an ideal

monatomic gas is also      that is,

The internal energy is just the number of molecules multiplied by the average mechanical energy per molecule. Thus
for n moles of an ideal monatomic gas,

                                                                                                                                                       3.6

Notice that the internal energy of a given quantity of an ideal monatomic gas depends on just the temperature and is
completely independent of the pressure and volume of the gas. For other systems, the internal energy cannot be
expressed so simply. However, an increase in internal energy can often be associated with an increase in
temperature.
110  3 · The First Law of Thermodynamics

     We know from the zeroth law of thermodynamics that when two systems are placed in thermal contact, they
     eventually reach thermal equilibrium, at which point they are at the same temperature. As an example, suppose we
     mix two monatomic ideal gases. Now, the energy per molecule of an ideal monatomic gas is proportional to its
     temperature. Thus, when the two gases are mixed, the molecules of the hotter gas must lose energy and the
     molecules of the colder gas must gain energy. This continues until thermal equilibrium is reached, at which point,
     the temperature, and therefore the average translational kinetic energy per molecule, is the same for both gases.
     The approach to equilibrium for real systems is somewhat more complicated than for an ideal monatomic gas.
     Nevertheless, we can still say that energy is exchanged between the systems until their temperatures are the same.

     3.3 First Law of Thermodynamics

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · State the first law of thermodynamics and explain how it is applied
         · Explain how heat transfer, work done, and internal energy change are related in any thermodynamic

             process

     Now that we have seen how to calculate internal energy, heat, and work done for a thermodynamic system
     undergoing change during some process, we can see how these quantities interact to affect the amount of change
     that can occur. This interaction is given by the first law of thermodynamics. British scientist and novelist C. P. Snow
     (1905-1980) is credited with a joke about the four laws of thermodynamics. His humorous statement of the first
     law of thermodynamics is stated "you can't win," or in other words, you cannot get more energy out of a system than
     you put into it. We will see in this chapter how internal energy, heat, and work all play a role in the first law of
     thermodynamics.

     Suppose Q represents the heat exchanged between a system and the environment, and W is the work done by or on

     the system. The first law states that the change in internal energy of that system is given by  . Since added

     heat increases the internal energy of a system, Q is positive when it is added to the system and negative when it is

     removed from the system.

     When a gas expands, it does work and its internal energy decreases. Thus, W is positive when work is done by the
     system and negative when work is done on the system. This sign convention is summarized in Table 3.1. The first
     law of thermodynamics is stated as follows:

     FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS                                                 The change in       for any

     Associated with every equilibrium state of a system is its internal energy
     transition between two equilibrium states is

     where Q and W represent, respectively, the heat exchanged by the system and the work done by or on the
     system.

The first law is a statement of energy conservation. It tells us that a system can exchange energy with its
surroundings by the transmission of heat and by the performance of work. The net energy exchanged is then equal
to the change in the total mechanical energy of the molecules of the system (i.e., the system's internal energy).
Thus, if a system is isolated, its internal energy must remain constant.

Although Q and W both depend on the thermodynamic path taken between two equilibrium states, their difference
           does not. Figure 3.7 shows the pV diagram of a system that is making the transition from A to B repeatedly

along different thermodynamic paths. Along path 1, the system absorbs heat and does work along path 2, it
absorbs heat and does work and so on. The values of and may vary from path to path, but we have

or

That is, the change in the internal energy of the system between A and B is path independent. In the chapter on

potential energy and the conservation of energy, we encountered another path-independent quantity: the change in

potential energy between two arbitrary points in space. This change represents the negative of the work done by a

conservative force between the two points. The potential energy is a function of spatial coordinates, whereas the

internal energy is a function of thermodynamic variables. For example, we might write  for the internal

energy. Functions such as internal energy and potential energy are known as state functions because their values

depend solely on the state of the system.

FIGURE 3.7 Different thermodynamic paths taken by a system in going from state A to state B. For all transitions, the change in the internal

energy of the system  is the same.

Often the first law is used in its differential form, which is
                                                                                                                                                       3.8

Here  is an infinitesimal change in internal energy when an infinitesimal amount of heat dQ is exchanged with

the system and an infinitesimal amount of work dW is done by (positive in sign) or on (negative in sign) the system.

             EXAMPLE 3.2

     Changes of State and the First Law

     During a thermodynamic process, a system moves from state A to state B, it is supplied with 400 J of heat and does
     100 J of work. (a) For this transition, what is the system's change in internal energy? (b) If the system then moves
     from state B back to state A, what is its change in internal energy? (c) If in moving from A to B along a different path,

                           of work is done on the system, how much heat does it absorb?

     Strategy
     The first law of thermodynamics relates the internal energy change, work done by the system, and the heat
     transferred to the system in a simple equation. The internal energy is a function of state and is therefore fixed at any
     given point regardless of how the system reaches the state.

     Solution

       a. From the first law, the change in the system's internal energy is

     b. Consider a closed path that passes through the states A and B. Internal energy is a state function, so            is

     zero for a closed path. Thus

     and

     This yields

     c. The change in internal energy is the same for any path, so

     and the heat exchanged is

     The negative sign indicates that the system loses heat in this transition.

     Significance

     When a closed cycle is considered for the first law of thermodynamics, the change in internal energy around the
     whole path is equal to zero. If friction were to play a role in this example, less work would result from this heat
     added. Example 3.3 takes into consideration what happens if friction plays a role.

     If the system were an ideal gas, the work would be the integral of  , and positive work done by the system would

     imply an expansion (             ).

     Changing the path from A to B could not change the sign of the work done, since negative work would imply that
                   , contradicting the conclusion reached in part a. Not every system is a gas, however, and not all work

     changes the volume of the system. For example, the work in this case may be a combination of positive work done
     by a spring being compressed a fixed amount and a variable, path dependent, amount of negative work by friction.
     In the first path of part a, friction does less work than the spring, so the total work is positive, but in the second path
     in part c, more of the work is done by friction, so the total work is negative.

     Notice that in Example 3.2, we did not assume that the transitions were quasi-static. This is because the first law is
     not subject to such a restriction. It describes transitions between equilibrium states but is not concerned with the
     intermediate states. The system does not have to pass through only equilibrium states. For example, if a gas in a
     steel container at a well-defined temperature and pressure is made to explode by means of a spark, some of the gas
     may condense, different gas molecules may combine to form new compounds, and there may be all sorts of
     turbulence in the container--but eventually, the system will settle down to a new equilibrium state. This system is

clearly not in equilibrium during its transition; however, its behavior is still governed by the first law because the
process starts and ends with the system in equilibrium states.

EXAMPLE 3.3

Polishing a Fitting

A machinist polishes a 0.50-kg copper fitting with a piece of emery cloth for 2.0 min. He moves the cloth across the
fitting at a constant speed of 1.0 m/s by applying a force of 20 N, tangent to the surface of the fitting. (a) What is the
total work done on the fitting by the machinist? (b) What is the increase in the internal energy of the fitting? Assume
that the change in the internal energy of the cloth is negligible and that no heat is exchanged between the fitting and
its environment. (c) What is the increase in the temperature of the fitting?

Strategy

The machinist's force over a distance that can be calculated from the speed and time given is the work done on the
system. The work, in turn, increases the internal energy of the system. This energy can be interpreted as the heat
that raises the temperature of the system via its heat capacity. Be careful with the sign of each quantity.

Solution

a. The power created by a force on an object or the rate at which the machinist does frictional work on the fitting

is        . Thus, in an elapsed time (2.0 min), the work done on the fitting is

b. By assumption, no heat is exchanged between the fitting and its environment, so the first law gives for the
     change in the internal energy of the fitting:

c. Since  is path independent, the effect of the               of work is the same as if it were supplied at

atmospheric pressure by a transfer of heat. Thus,

and the increase in the temperature of the fitting is

where we have used the value for the specific heat of copper,  .

Significance
If heat were released, the change in internal energy would be less and cause less of a temperature change than
what was calculated in the problem.

     The difference in work done between process ABC and process ADC is the area enclosed by ABCD. Because the

     same as the difference in heat transferred to the system.

     3.4 Thermodynamic Processes

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define a thermodynamic process
         · Distinguish between quasi-static and non-quasi-static processes
         · Calculate physical quantities, such as the heat transferred, work done, and internal energy change for

             isothermal, adiabatic, and cyclical thermodynamic processes

     In solving mechanics problems, we isolate the body under consideration, analyze the external forces acting on it,
     and then use Newton's laws to predict its behavior. In thermodynamics, we take a similar approach. We start by
     identifying the part of the universe we wish to study; it is also known as our system. (We defined a system at the
     beginning of this chapter as anything whose properties are of interest to us; it can be a single atom or the entire
     Earth.) Once our system is selected, we determine how the environment, or surroundings, interact with the system.
     Finally, with the interaction understood, we study the thermal behavior of the system with the help of the laws of
     thermodynamics.

     The thermal behavior of a system is described in terms of thermodynamic variables. For an ideal gas, these variables
     are pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of molecules or moles of the gas. Different types of systems are
     generally characterized by different sets of variables. For example, the thermodynamic variables for a stretched
     rubber band are tension, length, temperature, and mass.

     The state of a system can change as a result of its interaction with the environment. The change in a system can be
     fast or slow and large or small. The manner in which a state of a system can change from an initial state to a final
     state is called a thermodynamic process. For analytical purposes in thermodynamics, it is helpful to divide up
     processes as either quasi-static or non-quasi-static, as we now explain.

     Quasi-static and Non-quasi-static Processes

     A quasi-static process refers to an idealized or imagined process where the change in state is made infinitesimally

     slowly so that at each instant, the system can be assumed to be at a thermodynamic equilibrium with itself and with

     the environment. For instance, imagine heating 1 kg of water from a temperature  to  at a constant

     pressure of 1 atmosphere. To heat the water very slowly, we may imagine placing the container with water in a large

     bath that can be slowly heated such that the temperature of the bath can rise infinitesimally slowly from       to

     . If we put 1 kg of water at         directly into a bath at  , the temperature of the water will rise rapidly to

     in a non-quasi-static way.

     Quasi-static processes are done slowly enough that the system remains at thermodynamic equilibrium at each

instant, despite the fact that the system changes over time. The thermodynamic equilibrium of the system is
necessary for the system to have well-defined values of macroscopic properties such as the temperature and the
pressure of the system at each instant of the process. Therefore, quasi-static processes can be shown as well-
defined paths in state space of the system.

Since quasi-static processes cannot be completely realized for any finite change of the system, all processes in
nature are non-quasi-static. Examples of quasi-static and non-quasi-static processes are shown in Figure 3.8.
Despite the fact that all finite changes must occur essentially non-quasi-statically at some stage of the change, we
can imagine performing infinitely many quasi-static process corresponding to every quasi-static process. Since
quasi-static processes can be analyzed analytically, we mostly study quasi-static processes in this book. We have
already seen that in a quasi-static process the work by a gas is given by pdV.

FIGURE 3.8 Quasi-static and non-quasi-static processes between states A and B of a gas. In a quasi-static process, the path of the process
between A and B can be drawn in a state diagram since all the states that the system goes through are known. In a non-quasi-static
process, the states between A and B are not known, and hence no path can be drawn. It may follow the dashed line as shown in the figure
or take a very different path.

Isothermal Processes

An isothermal process is a change in the state of the system at a constant temperature. This process is
accomplished by keeping the system in thermal equilibrium with a large heat bath during the process. Recall that a
heat bath is an idealized "infinitely" large system whose temperature does not change. In practice, the temperature
of a finite bath is controlled by either adding or removing a finite amount of energy as the case may be.
As an illustration of an isothermal process, consider a cylinder of gas with a movable piston immersed in a large
water tank whose temperature is maintained constant. Since the piston is freely movable, the pressure inside is
balanced by the pressure outside by some weights on the piston, as in Figure 3.9.

FIGURE 3.9 Expanding a system at a constant temperature. Removing weights on the piston leads to an imbalance of forces on the piston,
which causes the piston to move up. As the piston moves up, the temperature is lowered momentarily, which causes heat to flow from the
heat bath to the system. The energy to move the piston eventually comes from the heat bath.

As weights on the piston are removed, an imbalance of forces on the piston develops. The net nonzero force on the
piston would cause the piston to accelerate, resulting in an increase in volume. The expansion of the gas cools the
gas to a lower temperature, which makes it possible for the heat to enter from the heat bath into the system until
the temperature of the gas is reset to the temperature of the heat bath. If weights are removed in infinitesimal
118  3 · The First Law of Thermodynamics

     steps, the pressure in the system decreases infinitesimally slowly. This way, an isothermal process can be

     conducted quasi-statically. An isothermal line on a (p, V) diagram is represented by a curved line from starting point

     A to finishing point B, as seen in Figure 3.10. For an ideal gas, an isothermal process is hyperbolic, since for an ideal

     gas at constant temperature,         .

     FIGURE 3.10 An isothermal expansion from a state labeled A to another state labeled B on a pV diagram. The curve represents the relation
     between pressure and volume in an ideal gas at constant temperature.

     An isothermal process studied in this chapter is quasi-statically performed, since to be isothermal throughout the
     change of volume, you must be able to state the temperature of the system at each step, which is possible only if the
     system is in thermal equilibrium continuously. The system must go out of equilibrium for the state to change, but for
     quasi-static processes, we imagine that the process is conducted in infinitesimal steps such that these departures
     from equilibrium can be made as brief and as small as we like.

     Other quasi-static processes of interest for gases are isobaric and isochoric processes. An isobaric process is a
     process where the pressure of the system does not change, whereas an isochoric process is a process where the
     volume of the system does not change.

     Adiabatic Processes

     In an adiabatic process, the system is insulated from its environment so that although the state of the system
     changes, no heat is allowed to enter or leave the system, as seen in Figure 3.11. An adiabatic process can be
     conducted either quasi-statically or non-quasi-statically. When a system expands adiabatically, it must do work
     against the outside world, and therefore its energy goes down, which is reflected in the lowering of the temperature
     of the system. An adiabatic expansion leads to a lowering of temperature, and an adiabatic compression leads to an
     increase of temperature. We discuss adiabatic expansion again in Adiabatic Processes for an ideal Gas.

     FIGURE 3.11 An insulated piston with a hot, compressed gas is released. The piston moves up, the volume expands, and the pressure and
     temperature decrease. The internal energy goes into work. If the expansion occurs within a time frame in which negligible heat can enter
     the system, then the process is called adiabatic. Ideally, during an adiabatic process no heat enters or exits the system.

     Cyclic Processes

     We say that a system goes through a cyclic process if the state of the system at the end is same as the state at the
     beginning. Therefore, state properties such as temperature, pressure, volume, and internal energy of the system do
     not change over a complete cycle:

                                                                               3.5 · Heat Capacities of an Ideal Gas                           119

When the first law of thermodynamics is applied to a cyclic process, we obtain a simple relation between heat into
the system and the work done by the system over the cycle:

Thermodynamic processes are also distinguished by whether or not they are reversible. A reversible process is one
that can be made to retrace its path by differential changes in the environment. Such a process must therefore also
be quasi-static. Note, however, that a quasi-static process is not necessarily reversible, since there may be
dissipative forces involved. For example, if friction occurred between the piston and the walls of the cylinder
containing the gas, the energy lost to friction would prevent us from reproducing the original states of the system.

We considered several thermodynamic processes:

  1. An isothermal process, during which the system's temperature remains constant
  2. An adiabatic process, during which no heat is transferred to or from the system
  3. An isobaric process, during which the system's pressure does not change
  4. An isochoric process, during which the system's volume does not change

Many other processes also occur that do not fit into any of these four categories.

3.5 Heat Capacities of an Ideal Gas

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define heat capacity of an ideal gas for a specific process
    · Calculate the specific heat of an ideal gas for either an isobaric or isochoric process
    · Explain the difference between the heat capacities of an ideal gas and a real gas
    · Estimate the change in specific heat of a gas over temperature ranges

We learned about specific heat and molar heat capacity in Temperature and Heat; however, we have not considered
a process in which heat is added. We do that in this section. First, we examine a process where the system has a
constant volume, then contrast it with a system at constant pressure and show how their specific heats are related.

Let's start with looking at Figure 3.12, which shows two vessels A and B, each containing the same type of ideal gas

at a temperature T and a volume V. The only difference between the two vessels is that the piston at the top of A is

fixed, whereas the one at the top of B is free to move against a constant external pressure p. We now consider what

happens when the temperature of the gas in each vessel is slowly increased to  with the addition of heat.

FIGURE 3.12 Two vessels are identical except that the piston at the top of A is fixed, whereas that atop B is free to move against a constant
external pressure p.

Since the piston of vessel A is fixed, the volume of the enclosed gas does not change. Consequently, the gas does no
work, and we have from the first law
120  3 · The First Law of Thermodynamics

     We represent the fact that the heat is exchanged at constant volume by writing

     where is the molar heat capacity at constant volume of the gas, and, as before, n is the number of moles of the

     gas. In addition, since              for this particular process,

                                                                                                                    3.9

     We obtained this equation assuming the volume of the gas was fixed. However, internal energy is a state function

     that depends on only the temperature of an ideal gas. Therefore,                 gives the change in internal

     energy of an ideal gas for any process involving a temperature change dT.

     When the gas in vessel B is heated, it expands against the movable piston and does work  In this case,
     the heat is added at constant pressure, and we write

     where is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure of the gas. Furthermore, since the ideal gas expands
     against a constant pressure,

     Finally, inserting the expressions for dQ and pdV into the first law, we obtain

     We have found  for both an isochoric and an isobaric process. Because the internal energy of an ideal gas

     depends only on the temperature,     must be the same for both processes. Thus,

     and                                                                                                            3.10

     In the preceding chapter, we found the molar heat capacity of an ideal gas under constant volume to be

     where d is the number of degrees of freedom of a molecule in the system. Table 3.3 shows the molar heat capacities

     of some dilute ideal gases at room temperature. The heat capacities of real gases are somewhat higher than those

     predicted by the expressions of and given in Equation 3.10. This indicates that vibrational motion in

     polyatomic molecules is significant, even at room temperature. Nevertheless, the difference in the molar heat

     capacities,              is very close to R, even for the polyatomic gases.

3.6 Adiabatic Processes for an Ideal Gas

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas
    · Demonstrate the qualitative difference between adiabatic and isothermal expansions

When an ideal gas is compressed adiabatically     work is done on it and its temperature increases; in an

adiabatic expansion, the gas does work and its temperature drops. Adiabatic compressions actually occur in the

cylinders of a car, where the compressions of the gas-air mixture take place so quickly that there is no time for the

mixture to exchange heat with its environment. Nevertheless, because work is done on the mixture during the

compression, its temperature does rise significantly. In fact, the temperature increases can be so large that the

mixture can explode without the addition of a spark. Such explosions, since they are not timed, make a car run

poorly--it usually "knocks." Because ignition temperature rises with the octane of gasoline, one way to overcome

this problem is to use a higher-octane gasoline.

Another interesting adiabatic process is the free expansion of a gas. Figure 3.13 shows a gas confined by a

membrane to one side of a two-compartment, thermally insulated container. When the membrane is punctured, gas

rushes into the empty side of the container, thereby expanding freely. Because the gas expands "against a vacuum"

, it does no work, and because the vessel is thermally insulated, the expansion is adiabatic. With                 and

in the first law,             so                  for the free expansion.

FIGURE 3.13 The gas in the left chamber expands freely into the right chamber when the membrane is punctured.

If the gas is ideal, the internal energy depends only on the temperature. Therefore, when an ideal gas expands
freely, its temperature does not change.

A quasi-static, adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas is represented in Figure 3.14, which shows an insulated cylinder

that contains an ideal gas. The gas is made to expand quasi-statically by removing one grain of sand at a time from

the top of the piston. When the gas expands by dV, the change in its temperature is dT. The work done by the gas in

the expansion is                  because the cylinder is insulated; and the change in the internal energy of the

gas is, from Equation 3.9,        Therefore, from the first law,
122  3 · The First Law of Thermodynamics

     so

     FIGURE 3.14 When sand is removed from the piston one grain at a time, the gas expands adiabatically and quasi-statically in the insulated
     vessel.

     Also, for an ideal gas,

     so

     and

     We now have two equations for dT. Upon equating them, we find that

     Now, we divide this equation by npV and use                 . We are then left with

     which becomes

     where we define as the ratio of the molar heat capacities:

                                                                                          3.11

Thus,

and

Finally, using  , we can write this in the form

                                                                                           3.12

This equation is the condition that must be obeyed by an ideal gas in a quasi-static adiabatic process. For example,
if an ideal gas makes a quasi-static adiabatic transition from a state with pressure and volume and to a state
with and then it must be true that

The adiabatic condition of Equation 3.12 can be written in terms of other pairs of thermodynamic variables by
combining it with the ideal gas law. In doing this, we find that

                                                                                                                                                     3.13

A reversible adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas is represented on the pV diagram of Figure 3.15. The slope of the
curve at any point is

                                         FIGURE 3.15 Quasi-static adiabatic and isothermal expansions of an ideal gas.

The dashed curve shown on this pV diagram represents an isothermal expansion where T (and therefore pV) is
constant. The slope of this curve is useful when we consider the second law of thermodynamics in the next chapter.
This slope is

Because         the isothermal curve is not as steep as that for the adiabatic expansion.

     temperature, pressure, and volume of the resulting gas-air mixture are     ,            and                   ,

     respectively. The mixture is then compressed adiabatically to a volume of     . Note that in the actual operation

     of an automobile engine, the compression is not quasi-static, although we are making that assumption here. A

     second, important approximation is that although the vapor is a gasoline-air mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon

     dioxide, water, and hydrocarbons, we treat it as an ideal, diatomic gas. (a) What are the pressure and temperature of

     the mixture after the compression? (b) How much work is done by the mixture during the compression?

     Strategy
     Because we are modeling the process as a quasi-static adiabatic compression of an ideal gas, we have

     and  . The work needed can then be evaluated with                                    .

     Solution
       a. For an adiabatic compression we have

     Since we are treating the vapor as an ideal, diatomic gas, we can use                . So after the compression,
     the pressure of the mixture is

     From the ideal gas law, the temperature of the mixture after the compression is

     b. The work done by the mixture during the compression is

     With the adiabatic condition of Equation 3.12, we may write p as              where                   The work
     is therefore

     Significance
     The negative sign on the work done indicates that the piston does work on the gas-air mixture. The engine would not
     work if the gas-air mixture did work on the piston.

INTRODUCTION According to the first law of thermodynamics, the only processes that can occur are those that
conserve energy. But this cannot be the only restriction imposed by nature, because many seemingly possible
thermodynamic processes that would conserve energy do not occur. For example, when two bodies are in thermal
contact, heat never flows from the colder body to the warmer one, even though this is not forbidden by the first law.
So some other thermodynamic principles must be controlling the behavior of physical systems.
One such principle is the second law of thermodynamics, which limits the use of energy within a source. Energy
cannot arbitrarily pass from one object to another, just as we cannot transfer heat from a cold object to a hot one
without doing any work. We cannot unmix cream from coffee without a chemical process that changes the physical
characteristics of the system or its environment. We cannot use internal energy stored in the air to propel a car, or
use the energy of the ocean to run a ship, without disturbing something around that object.
In the chapter covering the first law of thermodynamics, we started our discussion with a joke by C. P. Snow stating
that the first law means "you can't win." He paraphrased the second law as "you can't break even, except on a very
cold day." Unless you are at zero kelvin, you cannot convert 100% of thermal energy into work. We start by
discussing spontaneous processes and explain why some processes require work to occur even if energy would

     have been conserved.

     4.1 Reversible and Irreversible Processes

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define reversible and irreversible processes
         · State the second law of thermodynamics via an irreversible process

     Consider an ideal gas that is held in half of a thermally insulated container by a wall in the middle of the container.
     The other half of the container is under vacuum with no molecules inside. Now, if we remove the wall in the middle
     quickly, the gas expands and fills up the entire container immediately, as shown in Figure 4.2.

     FIGURE 4.2 A gas expanding from half of a container to the entire container (a) before and (b) after the wall in the middle is removed.

     Because half of the container is under vacuum before the gas expands there, we do not expect any work to be done

     by the system--that is,          --because no force from the vacuum is exerted on the gas during the expansion. If the

     container is thermally insulated from the rest of the environment, we do not expect any heat transfer to the system

     either, so  . Then the first law of thermodynamics leads to the change of the internal energy of the system,

     For an ideal gas, if the internal energy doesn't change, then the temperature stays the same. Thus, the equation of

     state of the ideal gas gives us the final pressure of the gas,  where is the pressure of the gas

     before the expansion. The volume is doubled and the pressure is halved, but nothing else seems to have changed

     during the expansion.

     All of this discussion is based on what we have learned so far and makes sense. Here is what puzzles us: Can all the
     molecules go backward to the original half of the container in some future time? Our intuition tells us that this is
     going to be very unlikely, even though nothing we have learned so far prevents such an event from happening,
     regardless of how small the probability is. What we are really asking is whether the expansion into the vacuum half
     of the container is reversible.

     A reversible process is a process in which the system and environment can be restored to exactly the same initial
     states that they were in before the process occurred, if we go backward along the path of the process. The
     necessary condition for a reversible process is therefore the quasi-static requirement. Note that it is quite easy to
     restore a system to its original state; the hard part is to have its environment restored to its original state at the
     same time. For example, in the example of an ideal gas expanding into vacuum to twice its original volume, we can
     easily push it back with a piston and restore its temperature and pressure by removing some heat from the gas. The
     problem is that we cannot do it without changing something in its surroundings, such as dumping some heat there.

     A reversible process is truly an ideal process that rarely happens. We can make certain processes close to reversible
     and therefore use the consequences of the corresponding reversible processes as a starting point or reference. In
     reality, almost all processes are irreversible, and some properties of the environment are altered when the
     properties of the system are restored. The expansion of an ideal gas, as we have just outlined, is irreversible
     because the process is not even quasi-static, that is, not in an equilibrium state at any moment of the expansion.

From the microscopic point of view, a particle described by Newton's second law can go backward if we flip the

direction of time. But this is not the case, in practical terms, in a macroscopic system with more than  particles

or molecules, where numerous collisions between these molecules tend to erase any trace of memory of the initial

trajectory of each of the particles. For example, we can actually estimate the chance for all the particles in the

expanded gas to go back to the original half of the container, but the current age of the universe is still not long

enough for it to happen even once.

An irreversible process is what we encounter in reality almost all the time. The system and its environment cannot
be restored to their original states at the same time. Because this is what happens in nature, it is also called a
natural process. The sign of an irreversible process comes from the finite gradient between the states occurring in
the actual process. For example, when heat flows from one object to another, there is a finite temperature difference
(gradient) between the two objects. More importantly, at any given moment of the process, the system most likely is
not at equilibrium or in a well-defined state. This phenomenon is called irreversibility.

Let us see another example of irreversibility in thermal processes. Consider two objects in thermal contact: one at

temperature and the other at temperature  , as shown in Figure 4.3.

                  FIGURE 4.3 Spontaneous heat flow from an object at higher temperature to another at lower temperature

We know from common personal experience that heat flows from a hotter object to a colder one. For example, when
we hold a few pieces of ice in our hands, we feel cold because heat has left our hands into the ice. The opposite is
true when we hold one end of a metal rod while keeping the other end over a fire. Based on all of the experiments
that have been done on spontaneous heat transfer, the following statement summarizes the governing principle:

  SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS (CLAUSIUS STATEMENT)

  Heat never flows spontaneously from a colder object to a hotter object.

This statement turns out to be one of several different ways of stating the second law of thermodynamics. The form
of this statement is credited to German physicist Rudolf Clausius (1822-1888) and is referred to as the Clausius
statement of the second law of thermodynamics. The word "spontaneously" here means no other effort has been
made by a third party, or one that is neither the hotter nor colder object. We will introduce some other major
statements of the second law and show that they imply each other. In fact, all the different statements of the
second law of thermodynamics can be shown to be equivalent, and all lead to the irreversibility of spontaneous heat
flow between macroscopic objects of a very large number of molecules or particles.

Both isothermal and adiabatic processes sketched on a pV graph (discussed in The First Law of Thermodynamics)
are reversible in principle because the system is always at an equilibrium state at any point of the processes and can
go forward or backward along the given curves. Other idealized processes can be represented by pV curves; Table
4.1 summarizes the most common reversible processes.

     4.2 Heat Engines

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the function and components of a heat engine
         · Explain the efficiency of an engine
         · Calculate the efficiency of an engine for a given cycle of an ideal gas

     A heat engine is a device used to extract heat from a source and then convert it into mechanical work that is used
     for all sorts of applications. For example, a steam engine on an old-style train can produce the work needed for
     driving the train. Several questions emerge from the construction and application of heat engines. For example,
     what is the maximum percentage of the heat extracted that can be used to do work? This turns out to be a question
     that can only be answered through the second law of thermodynamics.

     The second law of thermodynamics can be formally stated in several ways. One statement presented so far is about
     the direction of spontaneous heat flow, known as the Clausius statement. A couple of other statements are based
     on heat engines. Whenever we consider heat engines and associated devices such as refrigerators and heat pumps,
     we do not use the normal sign convention for heat and work. For convenience, we assume that the symbols
     and W represent only the amounts of heat transferred and work delivered, regardless what the givers or receivers
     are. Whether heat is entering or leaving a system and work is done to or by a system are indicated by proper signs in
     front of the symbols and by the directions of arrows in diagrams.

     It turns out that we need more than one heat source/sink to construct a heat engine. We will come back to this point
     later in the chapter, when we compare different statements of the second law of thermodynamics. For the moment,
     we assume that a heat engine is constructed between a heat source (high-temperature reservoir or hot reservoir)
     and a heat sink (low-temperature reservoir or cold reservoir), represented schematically in Figure 4.4. The engine
     absorbs heat from a heat source (hot reservoir) of Kelvin temperature uses some of that energy to produce
     useful work W, and then discards the remaining energy as heat into a heat sink (cold reservoir) of Kelvin
     temperature Power plants and internal combustion engines are examples of heat engines. Power plants use
     steam produced at high temperature to drive electric generators, while exhausting heat to the atmosphere or a
     nearby body of water in the role of the heat sink. In an internal combustion engine, a hot gas-air mixture is used to
     push a piston, and heat is exhausted to the nearby atmosphere in a similar manner.

          FIGURE 4.4 A schematic representation of a heat engine. Energy flows from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir while doing work.

     Actual heat engines have many different designs. Examples include internal combustion engines, such as those
     used in most cars today, and external combustion engines, such as the steam engines used in old steam-engine
     trains. Figure 4.5 shows a photo of a nuclear power plant in operation. The atmosphere around the reactors acts as

the cold reservoir, and the heat generated from the nuclear reaction provides the heat from the hot reservoir.

FIGURE 4.5 The heat exhausted from a nuclear power plant goes to the cooling towers, where it is released into the atmosphere.

Heat engines operate by carrying a working substance through a cycle. In a steam power plant, the working
substance is water, which starts as a liquid, becomes vaporized, is then used to drive a turbine, and is finally
condensed back into the liquid state. As is the case for all working substances in cyclic processes, once the water
returns to its initial state, it repeats the same sequence.

For now, we assume that the cycles of heat engines are reversible, so there is no energy loss to friction or other

irreversible effects. Suppose that the engine of Figure 4.4 goes through one complete cycle and that            and W

represent the heats exchanged and the work done for that cycle. Since the initial and final states of the system are

the same,     for the cycle. We therefore have from the first law of thermodynamics,

so that
                                                                                                                                                       4.1

The most important measure of a heat engine is its efficiency (e), which is simply "what we get out" divided by
"what we put in" during each cycle, as defined by

With a heat engine working between two heat reservoirs, we get out W and put in      so the efficiency of the engine
is

                                                                                                                    4.2

Here, we used Equation 4.1,  in the final step of this expression for the efficiency.

EXAMPLE 4.1

A Lawn Mower

A lawn mower is rated to have an efficiency of  and an average power of 3.00 kW. What are (a) the average

work and (b) the minimum heat discharge into the air by the lawn mower in one minute of use?

Strategy

From the average power--that is, the rate of work production--we can figure out the work done in the given elapsed

time. Then, from the efficiency given, we can figure out the minimum heat discharge                   with

Solution
  a. The average work delivered by the lawn mower is

b. The minimum heat discharged into the air is given by
140  4 · The Second Law of Thermodynamics

             which leads to

     Significance
     As the efficiency rises, the minimum heat discharged falls. This helps our environment and atmosphere by not
     having as much waste heat expelled.

     4.3 Refrigerators and Heat Pumps

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe a refrigerator and a heat pump and list their differences
         · Calculate the performance coefficients of simple refrigerators and heat pumps

     The cycles we used to describe the engine in the preceding section are all reversible, so each sequence of steps can
     just as easily be performed in the opposite direction. In this case, the engine is known as a refrigerator or a heat
     pump, depending on what is the focus: the heat removed from the cold reservoir or the heat dumped to the hot
     reservoir. Either a refrigerator or a heat pump is an engine running in reverse. For a refrigerator, the focus is on
     removing heat from a specific area. For a heat pump, the focus is on dumping heat to a specific area.

     We first consider a refrigerator (Figure 4.6). The purpose of this engine is to remove heat from the cold reservoir,
     which is the space inside the refrigerator for an actual household refrigerator or the space inside a building for an
     air-conditioning unit.

     FIGURE 4.6 A schematic representation of a refrigerator (or a heat pump). The arrow next to work (W) indicates work being put into the
     system.

     A refrigerator (or heat pump) absorbs heat from the cold reservoir at Kelvin temperature and discards heat
          to the hot reservoir at Kelvin temperature while work W is done on the engine's working substance, as shown

     by the arrow pointing toward the system in the figure. A household refrigerator removes heat from the food within it
     while exhausting heat to the surrounding air. The required work, for which we pay in our electricity bill, is performed
     by the motor that moves a coolant through the coils. A schematic sketch of a household refrigerator is given in
     Figure 4.7.

It is then compressed and sent through the condenser, where it exhausts heat to the outside.

The effectiveness or coefficient of performance of a refrigerator is measured by the heat removed from the
cold reservoir divided by the work done by the working substance cycle by cycle:

4.4 Statements of the Second Law of Thermodynamics

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Contrast the second law of thermodynamics statements according to Kelvin and Clausius formulations
    · Interpret the second of thermodynamics via irreversibility

Earlier in this chapter, we introduced the Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics, which is based
142  4 · The Second Law of Thermodynamics

     on the irreversibility of spontaneous heat flow. As we remarked then, the second law of thermodynamics can be
     stated in several different ways, and all of them can be shown to imply the others. In terms of heat engines, the
     second law of thermodynamics may be stated as follows:

       SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS (KELVIN STATEMENT)

       It is impossible to convert the heat from a single source into work without any other effect.

     This is known as the Kelvin statement of the second law of thermodynamics. This statement describes an
     unattainable "perfect engine," as represented schematically in Figure 4.8(a). Note that "without any other effect" is
     a very strong restriction. For example, an engine can absorb heat and turn it all into work, but not if it completes a
     cycle. Without completing a cycle, the substance in the engine is not in its original state and therefore an "other
     effect" has occurred. Another example is a chamber of gas that can absorb heat from a heat reservoir and do work
     isothermally against a piston as it expands. However, if the gas were returned to its initial state (that is, made to
     complete a cycle), it would have to be compressed and heat would have to be extracted from it.

     The Kelvin statement is a manifestation of a well-known engineering problem. Despite advancing technology, we are

     not able to build a heat engine that is  efficient. The first law does not exclude the possibility of constructing a

     perfect engine, but the second law forbids it.

     FIGURE 4.8 (a) A "perfect heat engine" converts all input heat into work. (b) A "perfect refrigerator" transports heat from a cold reservoir to
     a hot reservoir without work input. Neither of these devices is achievable in reality.

     We can show that the Kelvin statement is equivalent to the Clausius statement if we view the two objects in the
     Clausius statement as a cold reservoir and a hot reservoir. Thus, the Clausius statement becomes: It is impossible to
     construct a refrigerator that transfers heat from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir without aid from an external
     source. The Clausius statement is related to the everyday observation that heat never flows spontaneously from a
     cold object to a hot object. Heat transfer in the direction of increasing temperature always requires some energy
     input. A "perfect refrigerator," shown in Figure 4.8(b), which works without such external aid, is impossible to
     construct.

     To prove the equivalence of the Kelvin and Clausius statements, we show that if one statement is false, it necessarily

     follows that the other statement is also false. Let us first assume that the Clausius statement is false, so that the

     perfect refrigerator of Figure 4.8(b) does exist. The refrigerator removes heat Q from a cold reservoir at a

     temperature and transfers all of it to a hot reservoir at a temperature Now consider a real heat engine

     working in the same temperature range. It extracts heat  from the hot reservoir, does work W, and discards

     heat Q to the cold reservoir. From the first law, these quantities are related by                             .

     Suppose these two devices are combined as shown in Figure 4.9. The net heat removed from the hot reservoir is
          , no net heat transfer occurs to or from the cold reservoir, and work W is done on some external body. Since
                  , the combination of a perfect refrigerator and a real heat engine is itself a perfect heat engine, thereby

     contradicting the Kelvin statement. Thus, if the Clausius statement is false, the Kelvin statement must also be false.

FIGURE 4.9 Combining a perfect refrigerator and a real heat engine yields a perfect heat engine because

Using the second law of thermodynamics, we now prove two important properties of heat engines operating
between two heat reservoirs. The first property is that any reversible engine operating between two reservoirs has a
greater efficiency than any irreversible engine operating between the same two reservoirs.

The second property to be demonstrated is that all reversible engines operating between the same two reservoirs

have the same efficiency. To show this, we start with the two engines D and E of Figure 4.10(a), which are operating

between two common heat reservoirs at temperatures           First, we assume that D is a reversible engine and

that E is a hypothetical irreversible engine that has a higher efficiency than D. If both engines perform the same

amount of work per cycle, it follows from Equation 4.2 that                 . It then follows from the first law that

FIGURE 4.10 (a) Two uncoupled engines D and E working between the same reservoirs. (b) The coupled engines, with D working in reverse.

Suppose the cycle of D is reversed so that it operates as a refrigerator, and the two engines are coupled such that

the work output of E is used to drive D, as shown in Figure 4.10(b). Since       and                     the net result of

each cycle is equivalent to a spontaneous transfer of heat from the cold reservoir to the hot reservoir, a process the

second law does not allow. The original assumption must therefore be wrong, and it is impossible to construct an

irreversible engine such that E is more efficient than the reversible engine D.

Now it is quite easy to demonstrate that the efficiencies of all reversible engines operating between the same
reservoirs are equal. Suppose that D and E are both reversible engines. If they are coupled as shown in Figure
4.10(b), the efficiency of E cannot be greater than the efficiency of D, or the second law would be violated. If both
engines are then reversed, the same reasoning implies that the efficiency of D cannot be greater than the efficiency
of E. Combining these results leads to the conclusion that all reversible engines working between the same two
reservoirs have the same efficiency.

     4.5 The Carnot Cycle

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
         · Describe the Carnot cycle with the roles of all four processes involved
         · Outline the Carnot principle and its implications
         · Demonstrate the equivalence of the Carnot principle and the second law of thermodynamics

     In the early 1820s, Sadi Carnot (1786-1832), a French engineer, became interested in improving the efficiencies of
     practical heat engines. In 1824, his studies led him to propose a hypothetical working cycle with the highest
     possible efficiency between the same two reservoirs, known now as the Carnot cycle. An engine operating in this
     cycle is called a Carnot engine. The Carnot cycle is of special importance for a variety of reasons. At a practical
     level, this cycle represents a reversible model for the steam power plant and the refrigerator or heat pump. Yet, it is
     also very important theoretically, for it plays a major role in the development of another important statement of the
     second law of thermodynamics. Finally, because only two reservoirs are involved in its operation, it can be used
     along with the second law of thermodynamics to define an absolute temperature scale that is truly independent of
     any substance used for temperature measurement.

     With an ideal gas as the working substance, the steps of the Carnot cycle, as represented by Figure 4.11, are as
     follows.

     1. Isothermal expansion. The gas is placed in thermal contact with a heat reservoir at a temperature The gas

     absorbs heat from the heat reservoir and is allowed to expand isothermally, doing work Because the

     internal energy of an ideal gas is a function of the temperature only, the change of the internal energy is

     zero, that is,  during this isothermal expansion. With the first law of thermodynamics,

                     we find that the heat absorbed by the gas is

              FIGURE 4.11 The four processes of the Carnot cycle. The working substance is assumed to be an ideal gas whose thermodynamic
              path MNOP is represented in Figure 4.12.

     FIGURE 4.12 The total work done by the gas in the Carnot cycle is shown and given by the area enclosed by the loop MNOPM.

2. Adiabatic expansion. The gas is thermally isolated and allowed to expand further, doing work  Because

     this expansion is adiabatic, the temperature of the gas falls--in this case, from    From

                  and the equation of state for an ideal gas,                  , we have

     so that

3. Isothermal compression. The gas is placed in thermal contact with a cold reservoir at temperature and
     compressed isothermally. During this process, work is done on the gas and it gives up heat to the cold
     reservoir. The reasoning used in step 1 now yields

     where is the heat dumped to the cold reservoir by the gas.

4. Adiabatic compression. The gas is thermally isolated and returned to its initial state by compression. In this

     process, work is done on the gas. Because the compression is adiabatic, the temperature of the gas

     rises--from  in this particular case. The reasoning of step 2 now gives

        The total work done by the gas in the Carnot cycle is given by

This work is equal to the area enclosed by the loop shown in the pV diagram of Figure 4.12. Because the initial and
final states of the system are the same, the change of the internal energy of the gas in the cycle must be zero, that is,

              . The first law of thermodynamics then gives

and

To find the efficiency of this engine, we first divide

When the adiabatic constant from step 2 is divided by that of step 4, we find

Substituting this into the equation for  we obtain
146  4 · The Second Law of Thermodynamics

     Finally, with Equation 4.2, we find that the efficiency of this ideal gas Carnot engine is given by
                                                                                                                                                            4.5

     An engine does not necessarily have to follow a Carnot engine cycle. All engines, however, have the same net effect,
     namely the absorption of heat from a hot reservoir, the production of work, and the discarding of heat to a cold
     reservoir. This leads us to ask: Do all reversible cycles operating between the same two reservoirs have the same
     efficiency? The answer to this question comes from the second law of thermodynamics discussed earlier: All
     reversible engine cycles produce exactly the same efficiency. Also, as you might expect, all real engines operating
     between two reservoirs are less efficient than reversible engines operating between the same two reservoirs. This
     too is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics shown earlier.

     The cycle of an ideal gas Carnot refrigerator is represented by the pV diagram of Figure 4.13. It is a Carnot engine
     operating in reverse. The refrigerator extracts heat from a cold-temperature reservoir at when the ideal gas
     expands isothermally. The gas is then compressed adiabatically until its temperature reaches after which an
     isothermal compression of the gas results in heat being discarded to a high-temperature reservoir at Finally,
     the cycle is completed by an adiabatic expansion of the gas, causing its temperature to drop to

     FIGURE 4.13 The work done on the gas in one cycle of the Carnot refrigerator is shown and given by the area enclosed by the loop MPONM.

     The work done on the ideal gas is equal to the area enclosed by the path of the pV diagram. From the first law, this
     work is given by

     An analysis just like the analysis done for the Carnot engine gives

     When combined with Equation 4.3, this yields
                                                                                                                                                            4.6

     for the coefficient of performance of the ideal-gas Carnot refrigerator. Similarly, we can work out the coefficient of
     performance for a Carnot heat pump as

                                                                                                                                                            4.7

     We have just found equations representing the efficiency of a Carnot engine and the coefficient of performance of a
     Carnot refrigerator or a Carnot heat pump, assuming an ideal gas for the working substance in both devices.
     However, these equations are more general than their derivations imply. We will soon show that they are both valid

no matter what the working substance is.
Carnot summarized his study of the Carnot engine and Carnot cycle into what is now known as Carnot's principle:

  CARNOT'S PRINCIPLE

  No engine working between two reservoirs at constant temperatures can have a greater efficiency than a
  reversible engine.

This principle can be viewed as another statement of the second law of thermodynamics and can be shown to be
equivalent to the Kelvin statement and the Clausius statement.

EXAMPLE 4.2

The Carnot Engine

A Carnot engine has an efficiency of 0.60 and the temperature of its cold reservoir is 300 K. (a) What is the
temperature of the hot reservoir? (b) If the engine does 300 J of work per cycle, how much heat is removed from the
high-temperature reservoir per cycle? (c) How much heat is exhausted to the low-temperature reservoir per cycle?

Strategy

From the temperature dependence of the thermal efficiency of the Carnot engine, we can find the temperature of
the hot reservoir. Then, from the definition of the efficiency, we can find the heat removed when the work done by
the engine is given. Finally, energy conservation will lead to how much heat must be dumped to the cold reservoir.

Solution

a. From             we have

so that the temperature of the hot reservoir is

b. By definition, the efficiency of the engine is        , so that the heat removed from the high-temperature
     reservoir per cycle is

c. From the first law, the heat exhausted to the low-temperature reservoir per cycle by the engine is

Significance

A Carnot engine has the maximum possible efficiency of converting heat into work between two reservoirs, but this

does not necessarily mean it is  efficient. As the difference in temperatures of the hot and cold reservoir

increases, the efficiency of a Carnot engine increases.

. What is the work needed if the heat delivered to the inside of the house is 30.0 kJ?

Strategy
Because the heat pump is assumed to be a Carnot pump, its performance coefficient is given by
148  4 · The Second Law of Thermodynamics

                                              Thus, we can find the work W from the heat delivered

     Solution
     The work needed is obtained from

     Significance

     We note that this work depends not only on the heat delivered to the house but also on the temperatures outside
     and inside. The dependence on the temperature outside makes them impractical to use in areas where the
     temperature is much colder outside than room temperature.

     In terms of energy costs, the heat pump is a very economical means for heating buildings (Figure 4.14). Contrast

     this method with turning electrical energy directly into heat with resistive heating elements. In this case, one unit of

     electrical energy furnishes at most only one unit of heat. Unfortunately, heat pumps have problems that do limit

     their usefulness. They are quite expensive to purchase compared to resistive heating elements, and, as the

     performance coefficient for a Carnot heat pump shows, they become less effective as the outside temperature

     decreases. In fact, below about       , the heat they furnish is less than the energy used to operate them.

4.6 Entropy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section you will be able to:

    · Describe the meaning of entropy
    · Calculate the change of entropy for some simple processes

The second law of thermodynamics is best expressed in terms of a change in the thermodynamic variable known as
entropy, which is represented by the symbol S. Entropy, like internal energy, is a state function. This means that
when a system makes a transition from one state into another, the change in entropy is independent of path and
depends only on the thermodynamic variables of the two states.

We first consider for a system undergoing a reversible process at a constant temperature. In this case, the
change in entropy of the system is given by

                                                                                                                                                       4.8

where Q is the heat exchanged by the system kept at a temperature T (in kelvin). If the system absorbs heat--that is,

with  --the entropy of the system increases. As an example, suppose a gas is kept at a constant temperature of

300 K while it absorbs 10 J of heat in a reversible process. Then from Equation 4.8, the entropy change of the gas is

Similarly, if the gas loses 5.0 J of heat; that is,  , at temperature             , we have the entropy change
of the system given by

      EXAMPLE 4.4

Heat is slowly added to a 50-g chunk of ice at
What is the entropy change of the ice?

Strategy
Because the process is slow, we can approximate it as a reversible process. The temperature is a constant, and we
can therefore use Equation 4.8 in the calculation.

Solution
The ice is melted by the addition of heat:

In this reversible process, the temperature of the ice-water mixture is fixed at  or 273 K. Now from                ,

the entropy change of the ice is

when it melts to water at .

Significance
During a phase change, the temperature is constant, allowing us to use Equation 4.8 to solve this problem. The
same equation could also be used if we changed from a liquid to a gas phase, since the temperature does not
change during that process either.
150  4 · The Second Law of Thermodynamics

     The change in entropy of a system for an arbitrary, reversible transition for which the temperature is not necessarily

     constant is defined by modifying                . Imagine a system making a transition from state A to B in small,

     discrete steps. The temperatures associated with these states are and respectively. During each step of the

     transition, the system exchanges heat           reversibly at a temperature This can be accomplished

     experimentally by placing the system in thermal contact with a large number of heat reservoirs of varying

     temperatures , as illustrated in Figure 4.15. The change in entropy for each step is  The net change

     in entropy of the system for the transition is

                                                                                                                                          4.9

     We now take the limit as          , and the number of steps approaches infinity. Then, replacing the summation by
     an integral, we obtain                                                                                                                 4.10

     where the integral is taken between the initial state A and the final state B. This equation is valid only if the
     transition from A to B is reversible.

     FIGURE 4.15 The gas expands at constant pressure as its temperature is increased in small steps through the use of a series of heat
     reservoirs.

     As an example, let us determine the net entropy change of a reversible engine while it undergoes a single Carnot
     cycle. In the adiabatic steps 2 and 4 of the cycle shown in Figure 4.11, no heat exchange takes place, so

                                      In step 1, the engine absorbs heat at a temperature so its entropy change is

              Similarly, in step 3,                  The net entropy change of the engine in one cycle of operation

     is then

     However, we know that for a Carnot engine,

     so

     There is no net change in the entropy of the Carnot engine over a complete cycle. Although this result was obtained
     for a particular case, its validity can be shown to be far more general: There is no net change in the entropy of a
     system undergoing any complete reversible cyclic process. Mathematically, we write this statement as

Hence, the entropy change in going from A to B is the same for paths I and II. Since paths I and II are arbitrary,
reversible paths, the entropy change in a transition between two equilibrium states is the same for all the reversible
processes joining these states. Entropy, like internal energy, is therefore a state function.
What happens if the process is irreversible? When the process is irreversible, we expect the entropy of a closed
system, or the system and its environment (the universe), to increase. Therefore we can rewrite this expression as

                                                                                                                                                     4.12

where S is the total entropy of the closed system or the entire universe, and the equal sign is for a reversible
process. The fact is the entropy statement of the second law of thermodynamics:

  SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS (ENTROPY STATEMENT)

  The entropy of a closed system and the entire universe never decreases.

We can show that this statement is consistent with the Kelvin statement, the Clausius statement, and the Carnot
principle.

     Entropy Change of a System during an Isobaric Process

     Determine the entropy change of an object of mass m and specific heat c that is cooled rapidly (and irreversibly) at
     constant pressure from to

     Strategy
     The process is clearly stated as an irreversible process; therefore, we cannot simply calculate the entropy change
     from the actual process. However, because entropy of a system is a function of state, we can imagine a reversible
     process that starts from the same initial state and ends at the given final state. Then, the entropy change of the

     system is given by Equation 4.10,

     Solution
     To replace this rapid cooling with a process that proceeds reversibly, we imagine that the hot object is put into
     thermal contact with successively cooler heat reservoirs whose temperatures range from to Throughout the
     substitute transition, the object loses infinitesimal amounts of heat dQ, so we have

     From the definition of heat capacity, an infinitesimal exchange dQ for the object is related to its temperature change
     dT by

     Substituting this dQ into the expression for  , we obtain the entropy change of the object as it is cooled at
     constant pressure from

     Note that        here because          In other words, the object has lost some entropy. But if we count

     whatever is used to remove the heat from the object, we would still end up with  because the

     process is irreversible.

     Significance

     If the temperature changes during the heat flow, you must keep it inside the integral to solve for the change in
     entropy. If, however, the temperature is constant, you can simply calculate the entropy change as the heat flow
     divided by the temperature.

     If this were a Carnot engine operating between the same heat reservoirs, its efficiency would be

     Therefore, the Carnot engine would have a greater efficiency than the Stirling engine.

     Significance
     We have noted that all reversible engines operating between the same two reservoirs have the same efficiency.
     Since we found that the Stirling engine has a lower efficiency than the Carnot cycle, it must not be a reversible
     engine, and this is indeed the case. The isochoric steps are not reversible unless a regenerator is used to capture
     and reclaim the heat during these steps. With a perfect regenerator, the efficiency of the ideal Stirling engine would
     be the same as that of the Carnot engine.

     In the early days of steam engines, accidents would occur due to the high pressure of the steam in the boiler. Robert
     Stirling developed an engine in 1816 that did not use steam and therefore was safer. The Stirling engine was
     commonly used in the nineteenth century, but developments in steam and internal combustion engines have made
     it difficult to broaden the use of the Stirling engine.

     The Stirling engine uses compressed air as the working substance, which passes back and forth between two
     chambers with a porous plug, called the regenerator, which is made of material that does not conduct heat as well.
     In two of the steps, pistons in the two chambers move in phase.

     4.7 Entropy on a Microscopic Scale

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Interpret the meaning of entropy at a microscopic scale
         · Calculate a change in entropy for an irreversible process of a system and contrast with the change in

             entropy of the universe
         · Explain the third law of thermodynamics

     We have seen how entropy is related to heat exchange at a particular temperature. In this section, we consider
     entropy from a statistical viewpoint. Although the details of the argument are beyond the scope of this textbook, it
     turns out that entropy can be related to how disordered or randomized a system is--the more it is disordered, the
     higher is its entropy. For example, a new deck of cards is very ordered, as the cards are arranged numerically by suit.
     In shuffling this new deck, we randomize the arrangement of the cards and therefore increase its entropy (Figure
     4.17). Thus, by picking one card off the top of the deck, there would be no indication of what the next selected card
     will be.

The second law of thermodynamics requires that the entropy of the universe increase in any irreversible process.
Thus, in terms of order, the second law may be stated as follows:

In any irreversible process, the universe becomes more disordered. For example, the irreversible free expansion of
an ideal gas, shown in Figure 4.2, results in a larger volume for the gas molecules to occupy. A larger volume means
more possible arrangements for the same number of atoms, so disorder is also increased. As a result, the entropy of
the gas has gone up. The gas in this case is a closed system, and the process is irreversible. Changes in phase also
illustrate the connection between entropy and disorder.

EXAMPLE 4.7

Entropy Change of the Universe

Suppose we place 50 g of ice at  in contact with a heat reservoir at       . Heat spontaneously flows from the
                                                                              . Find the change in entropy of (a)
reservoir to the ice, which melts and eventually reaches a temperature of

the ice and (b) the universe.

Strategy

Because the entropy of a system is a function of its state, we can imagine two reversible processes for the ice: (1)

ice is melted at  and (2) melted ice (water) is warmed up from             to        under constant pressure.

Then, we add the change in entropy of the reservoir when we calculate the change in entropy of the universe.

Solution

a. From Equation 4.10, the increase in entropy of the ice is

  b. During this transition, the reservoir gives the ice an amount of heat equal to
This leads to a change (decrease) in entropy of the reservoir:
The increase in entropy of the universe is therefore
156  4 · The Second Law of Thermodynamics

     Significance

     The entropy of the universe therefore is greater than zero since the ice gains more entropy than the reservoir loses.
     If we considered only the phase change of the ice into water and not the temperature increase, the entropy change
     of the ice and reservoir would be the same, resulting in the universe gaining no entropy.

     This process also results in a more disordered universe. The ice changes from a solid with molecules located at
     specific sites to a liquid whose molecules are much freer to move. The molecular arrangement has therefore
     become more randomized. Although the change in average kinetic energy of the molecules of the heat reservoir is
     negligible, there is nevertheless a significant decrease in the entropy of the reservoir because it has many more
     molecules than the melted ice cube. However, the reservoir's decrease in entropy is still not as large as the increase
     in entropy of the ice. The increased disorder of the ice more than compensates for the increased order of the
     reservoir, and the entropy of the universe increases by 4.6 J/K.

     You might suspect that the growth of different forms of life might be a net ordering process and therefore a violation
     of the second law. After all, a single cell gathers molecules and eventually becomes a highly structured organism,
     such as a human being. However, this ordering process is more than compensated for by the disordering of the rest
     of the universe. The net result is an increase in entropy and an increase in the disorder of the universe.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 4.5

     In Example 4.7, the spontaneous flow of heat from a hot object to a cold object results in a net increase in entropy
     of the universe. Discuss how this result can be related to an increase in disorder of the system.

     The second law of thermodynamics makes clear that the entropy of the universe never decreases during any

     thermodynamic process. For any other thermodynamic system, when the process is reversible, the change of the

     entropy is given by              . But what happens if the temperature goes to zero,   ? It turns out this is not a

     question that can be answered by the second law.

     A fundamental issue still remains: Is it possible to cool a system all the way down to zero kelvin? We understand

     that the system must be at its lowest energy state because lowering temperature reduces the kinetic energy of the

     constituents in the system. What happens to the entropy of a system at the absolute zero temperature? It turns out

     the absolute zero temperature is not reachable--at least, not though a finite number of cooling steps. This is a

     statement of the third law of thermodynamics, whose proof requires quantum mechanics that we do not present

     here. In actual experiments, physicists have continuously pushed that limit downward, with the lowest temperature

     achieved at about                in a low-temperature lab at the Helsinki University of Technology in 2008.

     Like the second law of thermodynamics, the third law of thermodynamics can be stated in different ways. One of the
     common statements of the third law of thermodynamics is: The absolute zero temperature cannot be reached
     through any finite number of cooling steps.

     In other words, the temperature of any given physical system must be finite, that is,  . This produces a very

     interesting question in physics: Do we know how a system would behave if it were at the absolute zero temperature?

     The reason a system is unable to reach 0 K is fundamental and requires quantum mechanics to fully understand its
     origin. But we can certainly ask what happens to the entropy of a system when we try to cool it down to 0 K.
     Because the amount of heat that can be removed from the system becomes vanishingly small, we expect that the
     change in entropy of the system along an isotherm approaches zero, that is,

                                                                                                                       4.13

     This can be viewed as another statement of the third law, with all the isotherms becoming isentropic, or into a
     reversible ideal adiabat. We can put this expression in words: A system becomes perfectly ordered when its
     temperature approaches absolute zero and its entropy approaches its absolute minimum.

     The third law of thermodynamics puts another limit on what can be done when we look for energy resources. If

there could be a reservoir at the absolute zero temperature, we could have engines with efficiency of  , which
would, of course, violate the second law of thermodynamics.

Entropy Change of an Ideal Gas in Free Expansion

An ideal gas occupies a partitioned volume inside a box whose walls are thermally insulating, as shown in Figure
4.18(a). When the partition is removed, the gas expands and fills the entire volume of the box, as shown in part
(b). What is the entropy change of the universe (the system plus its environment)?

         FIGURE 4.18 The adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas from volume to volume .

Strategy

The adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas is an irreversible process. There is no change in the internal energy (and
hence temperature) of the gas in such an expansion because no work or heat transfer has happened. Since the
entropy of the system is a state variable, the entropy change of the system during the irreversible process is the
same as for any other path. A convenient alternative reversible path connecting the same two equilibrium states for
which we can calculate the change in entropy is a slow (quasistatic), isothermal expansion from to . In this
process, the gas could be expanding against a piston while in thermal contact with a heat reservoir, as in step 1 of
the Carnot cycle.

Solution                                                           where
Since the temperature is constant, the entropy change is given by

because  Now, with the help of the ideal gas law, we have

so the change in entropy of the gas is

Because  , is positive, and the entropy of the gas has gone up during the free expansion.

Significance

What about the environment? The walls of the container are thermally insulating, so no heat exchange takes place
between the gas and its surroundings. The entropy of the environment is therefore constant during the expansion.
The net entropy change of the universe is then simply the entropy change of the gas. Since this is positive, the
entropy of the universe increases in the free expansion of the gas.

     Entropy Change during Heat Transfer

     Heat flows from a steel object of mass 4.00 kg whose temperature is 400 K to an identical object at 300 K.
     Assuming that the objects are thermally isolated from the environment, what is the net entropy change of the
     universe after thermal equilibrium has been reached?

     Strategy
     Since the objects are identical, their common temperature at equilibrium is 350 K. To calculate the entropy changes
     associated with their transitions, we substitute the irreversible process of the heat transfer by two isobaric,
     reversible processes, one for each of the two objects. The entropy change for each object is then given by

     Solution  , the specific heat of steel, we have for the hotter object
     Using

     Similarly, the entropy change of the cooler object is

     The net entropy change of the two objects during the heat transfer is then

     Significance
     The objects are thermally isolated from the environment, so its entropy must remain constant. Thus, the entropy of

INTRODUCTION Back when we were studying Newton's laws, we identified several physical phenomena as forces.
We did so based on the effect they had on a physical object: Specifically, they caused the object to accelerate. Later,
when we studied impulse and momentum, we expanded this idea to identify a force as any physical phenomenon
that changed the momentum of an object. In either case, the result is the same: We recognize a force by the effect
that it has on an object.
In Gravitation (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/13-introduction), we examined the
force of gravity, which acts on all objects with mass. In this chapter, we begin the study of the electric force, which
acts on all objects with a property called charge. The electric force is much stronger than gravity (in most systems
where both appear), but it can be a force of attraction or a force of repulsion, which leads to very different effects on
objects. The electric force helps keep atoms together, so it is of fundamental importance in matter. But it also
governs most everyday interactions we deal with, from chemical interactions to biological processes.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the concept of electric charge
         · Explain qualitatively the force electric charge creates

     You are certainly familiar with electronic devices that you activate with the click of a switch, from computers to cell
     phones to television. And you have certainly seen electricity in a flash of lightning during a heavy thunderstorm. But
     you have also most likely experienced electrical effects in other ways, maybe without realizing that an electric force
     was involved. Let's take a look at some of these activities and see what we can learn from them about electric
     charges and forces.

     Discoveries

     You have probably experienced the phenomenon of static electricity: When you first take clothes out of a dryer,
     many (not all) of them tend to stick together; for some fabrics, they can be very difficult to separate. Another
     example occurs if you take a woolen sweater off quickly--you can feel (and hear) the static electricity pulling on your
     clothes, and perhaps even your hair. If you comb your hair on a dry day and then put the comb close to a thin stream
     of water coming out of a faucet, you will find that the water stream bends toward (is attracted to) the comb (Figure
     5.2).

     FIGURE 5.2 An electrically charged comb attracts a stream of water from a distance. Note that the water is not touching the comb. (credit:
     Jane Whitney)

     Suppose you bring the comb close to some small strips of paper; the strips of paper are attracted to the comb and
     even cling to it (Figure 5.3). In the kitchen, quickly pull a length of plastic cling wrap off the roll; it will tend to cling to
     most any nonmetallic material (such as plastic, glass, or food). If you rub a balloon on a wall for a few seconds, it will
     stick to the wall. Probably the most annoying effect of static electricity is getting shocked by a doorknob (or a friend)
     after shuffling your feet on some types of carpeting.

FIGURE 5.3 After being used to comb hair, this comb attracts small strips of paper from a distance, without physical contact. Investigation
of this behavior helped lead to the concept of the electric force. (credit: Jane Whitney)

Many of these phenomena have been known for centuries. The ancient Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus
(624-546 BCE) recorded that when amber (a hard, translucent, fossilized resin from extinct trees) was vigorously
rubbed with a piece of fur, a force was created that caused the fur and the amber to be attracted to each other
(Figure 5.4). Additionally, he found that the rubbed amber would not only attract the fur, and the fur attract the
amber, but they both could affect other (nonmetallic) objects, even if not in contact with those objects (Figure 5.5).

FIGURE 5.4 Borneo amber is mined in Sabah, Malaysia, from shale-sandstone-mudstone veins. When a piece of amber is rubbed with a
piece of fur, the amber gains more electrons, giving it a net negative charge. At the same time, the fur, having lost electrons, becomes
positively charged. (credit: "Sebakoamber"/Wikimedia Commons)

FIGURE 5.5 When materials are rubbed together, charges can be separated, particularly if one material has a greater affinity for electrons
than another. (a) Both the amber and cloth are originally neutral, with equal positive and negative charges. Only a tiny fraction of the
172  5 · Electric Charges and Fields

     charges are involved, and only a few of them are shown here. (b) When rubbed together, some negative charge is transferred to the amber,
     leaving the cloth with a net positive charge. (c) When separated, the amber and cloth now have net charges, but the absolute value of the
     net positive and negative charges will be equal.

     The English physicist William Gilbert (1544-1603) also studied this attractive force, using various substances. He
     worked with amber, and, in addition, he experimented with rock crystal and various precious and semi-precious
     gemstones. He also experimented with several metals. He found that the metals never exhibited this force, whereas
     the minerals did. Moreover, although an electrified amber rod would attract a piece of fur, it would repel another
     electrified amber rod; similarly, two electrified pieces of fur would repel each other.

     This suggested there were two types of an electric property; this property eventually came to be called electric
     charge. The difference between the two types of electric charge is in the directions of the electric forces that each
     type of charge causes: These forces are repulsive when the same type of charge exists on two interacting objects
     and attractive when the charges are of opposite types. The SI unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C), after the
     French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1736-1806).

     The most peculiar aspect of this new force is that it does not require physical contact between the two objects in
     order to cause an acceleration. This is an example of a so-called "long-range" force. (Or, as James Clerk Maxwell
     later phrased it, "action at a distance.") With the exception of gravity, all other forces we have discussed so far act
     only when the two interacting objects actually touch.

     The American physicist and statesman Benjamin Franklin found that he could concentrate charge in a "Leyden jar,"
     which was essentially a glass jar with two sheets of metal foil, one inside and one outside, with the glass between
     them (Figure 5.6). This created a large electric force between the two foil sheets.

     FIGURE 5.6 A Leyden jar (an early version of what is now called a capacitor) allowed experimenters to store large amounts of electric
     charge. Benjamin Franklin used such a jar to demonstrate that lightning behaved exactly like the electricity he got from the equipment in his
     laboratory.

     Franklin pointed out that the observed behavior could be explained by supposing that one of the two types of charge
     remained motionless, while the other type of charge flowed from one piece of foil to the other. He further suggested
     that an excess of what he called this "electrical fluid" be called "positive electricity" and the deficiency of it be
     called "negative electricity." His suggestion, with some minor modifications, is the model we use today. (With the

experiments that he was able to do, this was a pure guess; he had no way of actually determining the sign of the
moving charge. Unfortunately, he guessed wrong; we now know that the charges that flow are the ones Franklin
labeled negative, and the positive charges remain largely motionless. Fortunately, as we'll see, it makes no practical
or theoretical difference which choice we make, as long as we stay consistent with our choice.)

Let's list the specific observations that we have of this electric force:

· The force acts without physical contact between the two objects.
· The force can be either attractive or repulsive: If two interacting objects carry the same sign of charge, the

   force is repulsive; if the charges are of opposite sign, the force is attractive. These interactions are referred to
   as electrostatic repulsion and electrostatic attraction, respectively.
· Not all objects are affected by this force.
· The magnitude of the force decreases (rapidly) with increasing separation distance between the objects.

To be more precise, we find experimentally that the magnitude of the force decreases as the square of the distance
between the two interacting objects increases. Thus, for example, when the distance between two interacting
objects is doubled, the force between them decreases to one fourth what it was in the original system. We can also
observe that the surroundings of the charged objects affect the magnitude of the force. However, we will explore
this issue in a later chapter.

Properties of Electric Charge

In addition to the existence of two types of charge, several other properties of charge have been discovered.

· Charge is quantized. This means that electric charge comes in discrete amounts, and there is a smallest

possible amount of charge that an object can have. In the SI system, this smallest amount is

             . No free particle can have less charge than this, and, therefore, the charge on any

object--the charge on all objects--must be an integer multiple of this amount. All macroscopic, charged

objects have charge because electrons have either been added or taken away from them, resulting in a net

charge.

· The magnitude of the charge is independent of the type. Phrased another way, the smallest possible

positive charge (to four significant figures) is                           , and the smallest possible negative charge is

             ; these values are exactly equal. This is simply how the laws of physics in our universe

turned out.

· Charge is conserved. Charge can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transferred from place to

place, from one object to another. Frequently, we speak of two charges "canceling"; this is verbal shorthand. It

means that if two objects that have equal and opposite charges are physically close to each other, then the

(oppositely directed) forces they apply on some other charged object cancel, for a net force of zero. It is

important that you understand that the charges on the objects by no means disappear, however. The net

charge of the universe is constant.

· Charge is conserved in closed systems. In principle, if a negative charge disappeared from your lab bench

and reappeared on the Moon, conservation of charge would still hold. However, this never happens. If the total

charge you have in your local system on your lab bench is changing, there will be a measurable flow of charge

into or out of the system. Again, charges can and do move around, and their effects can and do cancel, but the

net charge in your local environment (if closed) is conserved. The last two items are both referred to as the

law of conservation of charge.

The Source of Charges: The Structure of the Atom

Once it became clear that all matter was composed of particles that came to be called atoms, it also quickly became
clear that the constituents of the atom included both positively charged particles and negatively charged particles.
The next question was, what are the physical properties of those electrically charged particles?

The negatively charged particle was the first one to be discovered. In 1897, the English physicist J. J. Thomson was
studying what was then known as cathode rays. Some years before, the English physicist William Crookes had
shown that these "rays" were negatively charged, but his experiments were unable to tell any more than that. (The
fact that they carried a negative electric charge was strong evidence that these were not rays at all, but particles.)
174  5 · Electric Charges and Fields

     Thomson prepared a pure beam of these particles and sent them through crossed electric and magnetic fields, and
     adjusted the various field strengths until the net deflection of the beam was zero. With this experiment, he was able
     to determine the charge-to-mass ratio of the particle. This ratio showed that the mass of the particle was much
     smaller than that of any other previously known particle--1837 times smaller, in fact. Eventually, this particle came
     to be called the electron.

     Since the atom as a whole is electrically neutral, the next question was to determine how the positive and negative
     charges are distributed within the atom. Thomson himself imagined that his electrons were embedded within a sort
     of positively charged paste, smeared out throughout the volume of the atom. However, in 1908, the New Zealand
     physicist Ernest Rutherford showed that the positive charges of the atom existed within a tiny core--called a
     nucleus--that took up only a very tiny fraction of the overall volume of the atom, but held over 99% of the mass.
     (See Linear Momentum and Collisions (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/
     9-introduction).) In addition, he showed that the negatively charged electrons perpetually orbited about this
     nucleus, forming a sort of electrically charged cloud that surrounds the nucleus (Figure 5.7). Rutherford concluded
     that the nucleus was constructed of small, massive particles that he named protons.

     FIGURE 5.7 This simplified model of a hydrogen atom shows a positively charged nucleus (consisting, in the case of hydrogen, of a single
     proton), surrounded by an electron "cloud." The charge of the electron cloud is equal (and opposite in sign) to the charge of the nucleus, but
     the electron does not have a definite location in space; hence, its representation here is as a cloud. Normal macroscopic amounts of matter
     contain immense numbers of atoms and molecules, and, hence, even greater numbers of individual negative and positive charges.

     Since it was known that different atoms have different masses, and that ordinarily atoms are electrically neutral, it
     was natural to suppose that different atoms have different numbers of protons in their nucleus, with an equal
     number of negatively charged electrons orbiting about the positively charged nucleus, thus making the atoms
     overall electrically neutral. However, it was soon discovered that although the lightest atom, hydrogen, did indeed
     have a single proton as its nucleus, the next heaviest atom--helium--has twice the number of protons (two), but four
     times the mass of hydrogen.

     This mystery was resolved in 1932 by the English physicist James Chadwick, with the discovery of the neutron. The
     neutron is, essentially, an electrically neutral twin of the proton, with no electric charge, but (nearly) identical mass
     to the proton. The helium nucleus therefore has two neutrons along with its two protons. (Later experiments were to
     show that although the neutron is electrically neutral overall, it does have an internal charge structure. Furthermore,
     although the masses of the neutron and the proton are nearly equal, they aren't exactly equal: The neutron's mass is
     very slightly larger than the mass of the proton. That slight mass excess turned out to be of great importance. That,
     however, is a story that will have to wait until our study of modern physics in Nuclear Physics (http://openstax.org/
     books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/10-introduction).)

     Thus, in 1932, the picture of the atom was of a small, massive nucleus constructed of a combination of protons and
     neutrons, surrounded by a collection of electrons whose combined motion formed a sort of negatively charged
     "cloud" around the nucleus (Figure 5.8). In an electrically neutral atom, the total negative charge of the collection of
     electrons is equal to the total positive charge in the nucleus. The very low-mass electrons can be more or less easily
     removed or added to an atom, changing the net charge on the atom (though without changing its type). An atom that

ions have had excess electrons added. We also use this term to describe molecules that are not electrically neutral.

FIGURE 5.8 The nucleus of a carbon atom is composed of six protons and six neutrons. As in hydrogen, the surrounding six electrons do not
have definite locations and so can be considered to be a sort of cloud surrounding the nucleus.

The story of the atom does not stop there, however. In the latter part of the twentieth century, many more
subatomic particles were discovered in the nucleus of the atom: pions, neutrinos, and quarks, among others. With
the exception of the photon, none of these particles are directly relevant to the study of electromagnetism, so we
defer further discussion of them until the chapter on particle physics (Particle Physics and Cosmology
(http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/11-introduction)).

A Note on Terminology

As noted previously, electric charge is a property that an object can have. This is similar to how an object can have a

property that we call mass, a property that we call density, a property that we call temperature, and so on.

Technically, we should always say something like, "Suppose we have a particle that carries a charge of         "

However, it is very common to say instead, "Suppose we have a  charge." Similarly, we often say something

like, "Six charges are located at the vertices of a regular hexagon." A charge is not a particle; rather, it is a property of

a particle. Nevertheless, this terminology is extremely common (and is frequently used in this book, as it is

everywhere else). So, keep in the back of your mind what we really mean when we refer to a "charge."

5.2 Conductors, Insulators, and Charging by Induction

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain what a conductor is
    · Explain what an insulator is
    · List the differences and similarities between conductors and insulators
    · Describe the process of charging by induction

In the preceding section, we said that scientists were able to create electric charge only on nonmetallic materials
and never on metals. To understand why this is the case, you have to understand more about the nature and
structure of atoms. In this section, we discuss how and why electric charges do--or do not--move through materials
(Figure 5.9). A more complete description is given in a later chapter.

     FIGURE 5.9 This power adapter uses metal wires and connectors to conduct electricity from the wall socket to a laptop computer. The
     conducting wires allow electrons to move freely through the cables, which are shielded by rubber and plastic. These materials act as
     insulators that don't allow electric charge to escape outward. (credit: modification of work by "Evan-Amos"/Wikimedia Commons)

     Conductors and Insulators

     As discussed in the previous section, electrons surround the tiny nucleus in the form of a (comparatively) vast cloud
     of negative charge. However, this cloud does have a definite structure to it. Let's consider an atom of the most
     commonly used conductor, copper.

     For reasons that will become clear in Atomic Structure (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/
     pages/8-introduction), there is an outermost electron that is only loosely bound to the atom's nucleus. It can be
     easily dislodged; it then moves to a neighboring atom. In a large mass of copper atoms (such as a copper wire or a
     sheet of copper), these vast numbers of outermost electrons (one per atom) wander from atom to atom, and are the
     electrons that do the moving when electricity flows. These wandering, or "free," electrons are called conduction
     electrons, and copper is therefore an excellent conductor (of electric charge). All conducting elements have a
     similar arrangement of their electrons, with one or two conduction electrons. This includes most metals.

     Insulators, in contrast, are made from materials that lack conduction electrons; charge flows only with great
     difficulty, if at all. Even if excess charge is added to an insulating material, it cannot move, remaining indefinitely in
     place. This is why insulating materials exhibit the electrical attraction and repulsion forces described earlier,
     whereas conductors do not; any excess charge placed on a conductor would instantly flow away (due to mutual
     repulsion from existing charges), leaving no excess charge around to create forces. Charge cannot flow along or
     through an insulator, so its electric forces remain for long periods of time. (Charge will dissipate from an insulator,
     given enough time.) As it happens, amber, fur, and most semi-precious gems are insulators, as are materials like
     wood, glass, and plastic.

     Charging by Induction

     Let's examine in more detail what happens in a conductor when an electrically charged object is brought close to it.
     As mentioned, the conduction electrons in the conductor are able to move with nearly complete freedom. As a
     result, when a charged insulator (such as a positively charged glass rod) is brought close to the conductor, the (total)
     charge on the insulator exerts an electric force on the conduction electrons. Since the rod is positively charged, the
     conduction electrons (which themselves are negatively charged) are attracted, flowing toward the insulator to the
     near side of the conductor (Figure 5.10).

     Now, the conductor is still overall electrically neutral; the conduction electrons have changed position, but they are
     still in the conducting material. However, the conductor now has a charge distribution; the near end (the portion of
     the conductor closest to the insulator) now has more negative charge than positive charge, and the reverse is true of
     the end farthest from the insulator. The relocation of negative charges to the near side of the conductor results in an
     overall positive charge in the part of the conductor farthest from the insulator. We have thus created an electric
     charge distribution where one did not exist before. This process is referred to as inducing polarization--in this case,
     polarizing the conductor. The resulting separation of positive and negative charge is called polarization, and a
     material, or even a molecule, that exhibits polarization is said to be polarized. A similar situation occurs with a

5.2 · Conductors, Insulators, and Charging by Induction                                                                                             177

negatively charged insulator, but the resulting polarization is in the opposite direction.

FIGURE 5.10 Induced polarization. A positively charged glass rod is brought near the left side of the conducting sphere, attracting negative
charge and leaving the other side of the sphere positively charged. Although the sphere is overall still electrically neutral, it now has a
charge distribution, so it can exert an electric force on other nearby charges. Furthermore, the distribution is such that it will be attracted to
the glass rod.

The result is the formation of what is called an electric dipole, from a Latin phrase meaning "two ends." The
presence of electric charges on the insulator--and the electric forces they apply to the conduction
electrons--creates, or "induces," the dipole in the conductor.

Neutral objects can be attracted to any charged object. The pieces of straw attracted to polished amber are neutral,
for example. If you run a plastic comb through your hair, the charged comb can pick up neutral pieces of paper.
Figure 5.11 shows how the polarization of atoms and molecules in neutral objects results in their attraction to a
charged object.

FIGURE 5.11 Both positive and negative objects attract a neutral object by polarizing its molecules. (a) A positive object brought near a
neutral insulator polarizes its molecules. There is a slight shift in the distribution of the electrons orbiting the molecule, with unlike charges
being brought nearer and like charges moved away. Since the electrostatic force decreases with distance, there is a net attraction. (b) A
negative object produces the opposite polarization, but again attracts the neutral object. (c) The same effect occurs for a conductor; since
the unlike charges are closer, there is a net attraction.

When a charged rod is brought near a neutral substance, an insulator in this case, the distribution of charge in atoms
and molecules is shifted slightly. Opposite charge is attracted nearer the external charged rod, while like charge is
repelled. Since the electrostatic force decreases with distance, the repulsion of like charges is weaker than the
attraction of unlike charges, and so there is a net attraction. Thus, a positively charged glass rod attracts neutral
pieces of paper, as will a negatively charged rubber rod. Some molecules, like water, are polar molecules. Polar
molecules have a natural or inherent separation of charge, although they are neutral overall. Polar molecules are
particularly affected by other charged objects and show greater polarization effects than molecules with naturally
uniform charge distributions.

When the two ends of a dipole can be separated, this method of charging by induction may be used to create
charged objects without transferring charge. In Figure 5.12, we see two neutral metal spheres in contact with one
another but insulated from the rest of the world. A positively charged rod is brought near one of them, attracting
negative charge to that side, leaving the other sphere positively charged.
178  5 · Electric Charges and Fields

     FIGURE 5.12 Charging by induction. (a) Two uncharged or neutral metal spheres are in contact with each other but insulated from the rest
     of the world. (b) A positively charged glass rod is brought near the sphere on the left, attracting negative charge and leaving the other
     sphere positively charged. (c) The spheres are separated before the rod is removed, thus separating negative and positive charges. (d) The
     spheres retain net charges after the inducing rod is removed--without ever having been touched by a charged object.

     Another method of charging by induction is shown in Figure 5.13. The neutral metal sphere is polarized when a
     charged rod is brought near it. The sphere is then grounded, meaning that a conducting wire is run from the sphere
     to the ground. Since Earth is large and most of the ground is a good conductor, it can supply or accept excess charge
     easily. In this case, electrons are attracted to the sphere through a wire called the ground wire, because it supplies a
     conducting path to the ground. The ground connection is broken before the charged rod is removed, leaving the
     sphere with an excess charge opposite to that of the rod. Again, an opposite charge is achieved when charging by
     induction, and the charged rod loses none of its excess charge.

5.3 Coulomb's Law

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe the electric force, both qualitatively and quantitatively
    · Calculate the force that charges exert on each other
    · Determine the direction of the electric force for different source charges
    · Correctly describe and apply the superposition principle for multiple source charges

Experiments with electric charges have shown that if two objects each have electric charge, then they exert an
electric force on each other. The magnitude of the force is linearly proportional to the net charge on each object and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. (Interestingly, the force does not depend on the
mass of the objects.) The direction of the force vector is along the imaginary line joining the two objects and is
dictated by the signs of the charges involved.

Let

·  the vector force exerted by charge 1 on charge 2;

·  the vector displacement from to .

The magnitude of the electric force on one of the charges is proportional to the magnitude of its own charge and
the magnitude of the other charge, and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:

This proportionality becomes an equality with the introduction of a proportionality constant. For reasons that will
become clear in a later chapter, the proportionality constant that we use is actually a collection of constants. (We
discuss this constant shortly.)

  COULOMB'S LAW

  The magnitude of the electric force (or Coulomb force) between two electrically charged particles is equal to
                                                                                                                                                    5.1

  If the charges have the same sign, the force is in the same direction as showing a repelling force. If the charges
180  5 · Electric Charges and Fields

     have different signs, the force is in the opposite direction of showing an attracting force. (Figure 5.14).

     FIGURE 5.14 The electrostatic force between point charges and separated by a distance r is given by Coulomb's law. Note that
     Newton's third law (every force exerted creates an equal and opposite force) applies as usual--the force on is equal in magnitude and
     opposite in direction to the force it exerts on . (a) Like charges; (b) unlike charges.

     It is important to note that the electric force is not constant; it is a function of the separation distance between the
     two charges. If either the test charge or the source charge (or both) move, then changes, and so does the force. An
     immediate consequence of this is that direct application of Newton's laws with this force can be mathematically
     difficult, depending on the specific problem at hand. It can (usually) be done, but we almost always look for easier
     methods of calculating whatever physical quantity we are interested in. (Conservation of energy is the most
     common choice.)
     Finally, the new constant in Coulomb's law is called the permittivity of free space, or (better) the permittivity of
     vacuum. It has a very important physical meaning that we will discuss in a later chapter; for now, it is simply an
     empirical proportionality constant. Its numerical value (to three significant figures) turns out to be

     These units are required to give the force in Coulomb's law the correct units of newtons. Note that in Coulomb's law,
     the permittivity of vacuum is only part of the proportionality constant. For convenience, we often define a Coulomb's
     constant:

             EXAMPLE 5.1

     The Force on the Electron in Hydrogen

     A hydrogen atom consists of a single proton and a single electron. The proton has a charge of and the electron
     has . In the "ground state" of the atom, the electron orbits the proton at most probable distance of

                             (Figure 5.15). Calculate the electric force on the electron due to the proton.

     the force; the hydrogen atom does not really look like this. Recall Figure 5.7.

Strategy
For the purposes of this example, we are treating the electron and proton as two point particles, each with an
electric charge, and we are told the distance between them; we are asked to calculate the force on the electron. We
thus use Coulomb's law.

Solution
Our two charges and the distance between them are,

The magnitude of the force on the electron is

As for the direction, since the charges on the two particles are opposite, the force is attractive; the force on the
electron points radially directly toward the proton, everywhere in the electron's orbit. The force is thus expressed as

Significance
This is a three-dimensional system, so the electron (and therefore the force on it) can be anywhere in an imaginary
spherical shell around the proton. In this "classical" model of the hydrogen atom, the electrostatic force on the
electron points in the inward centripetal direction, thus maintaining the electron's orbit. But note that the quantum
mechanical model of hydrogen (discussed in Quantum Mechanics (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-
volume-3/pages/7-introduction)) is utterly different.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 5.1

What would be different if the electron also had a positive charge?

Multiple Source Charges

The analysis that we have done for two particles can be extended to an arbitrary number of particles; we simply
repeat the analysis, two charges at a time. Specifically, we ask the question: Given N charges (which we refer to as
source charge), what is the net electric force that they exert on some other point charge (which we call the test
charge)? Note that we use these terms because we can think of the test charge being used to test the strength of the
force provided by the source charges.
Like all forces that we have seen up to now, the net electric force on our test charge is simply the vector sum of each
individual electric force exerted on it by each of the individual source charges. Thus, we can calculate the net force
on the test charge Q by calculating the force on it from each source charge, taken one at a time, and then adding all
those forces together (as vectors). This ability to simply add up individual forces in this way is referred to as the
principle of superposition, and is one of the more important features of the electric force. In mathematical form,
this becomes

                                                                                                                                                       5.2

In this expression, Q represents the charge of the particle that is experiencing the electric force , and is located at

from the origin; the are the N source charges, and the vectors  are the displacements from the
182  5 · Electric Charges and Fields

     position of the ith charge to the position of Q. Each of the N unit vectors points directly from its associated source
     charge toward the test charge. All of this is depicted in Figure 5.16. Please note that there is no physical difference
     between Q and ; the difference in labels is merely to allow clear discussion, with Q being the charge we are
     determining the force on.

     FIGURE 5.16 The eight source charges each apply a force on the single test charge Q. Each force can be calculated independently of the
     other seven forces. This is the essence of the superposition principle.

     (Note that the force vector does not necessarily point in the same direction as the unit vector ; it may point in
     the opposite direction, . The signs of the source charge and test charge determine the direction of the force on
     the test charge.)

     There is a complication, however. Just as the source charges each exert a force on the test charge, so too (by
     Newton's third law) does the test charge exert an equal and opposite force on each of the source charges. As a
     consequence, each source charge would change position. However, by Equation 5.2, the force on the test charge is a
     function of position; thus, as the positions of the source charges change, the net force on the test charge necessarily
     changes, which changes the force, which again changes the positions. Thus, the entire mathematical analysis
     quickly becomes intractable. Later, we will learn techniques for handling this situation, but for now, we make the
     simplifying assumption that the source charges are fixed in place somehow, so that their positions are constant in
     time. (The test charge is allowed to move.) With this restriction in place, the analysis of charges is known as
     electrostatics, where "statics" refers to the constant (that is, static) positions of the source charges and the force is
     referred to as an electrostatic force.

                FIGURE 5.17 Source charges and each apply a force on .

Strategy

We use Coulomb's law again. The way the question is phrased indicates that is our test charge, so that and
are source charges. The principle of superposition says that the force on from each of the other charges is
unaffected by the presence of the other charge. Therefore, we write down the force on from each and add them
together as vectors.

Solution

We have two source charges and a test charge  distances and                             and we are asked to find a

force. This calls for Coulomb's law and superposition of forces. There are two forces:

We can't add these forces directly because they don't point in the same direction: points only in the
-x-direction, while points only in the +y-direction. The net force is obtained from applying the Pythagorean
theorem to its x- and y-components:

where

and

We find that
at an angle of
184  5 · Electric Charges and Fields

     that is, above the -x-axis, as shown in the diagram.

     Significance
     Notice that when we substituted the numerical values of the charges, we did not include the negative sign of either

         or . Recall that negative signs on vector quantities indicate a reversal of direction of the vector in question. But
     for electric forces, the direction of the force is determined by the types (signs) of both interacting charges; we
     determine the force directions by considering whether the signs of the two charges are the same or are opposite. If
     you also include negative signs from negative charges when you substitute numbers, you run the risk of
     mathematically reversing the direction of the force you are calculating. Thus, the safest thing to do is to calculate
     just the magnitude of the force, using the absolute values of the charges, and determine the directions physically.

     It's also worth noting that the only new concept in this example is how to calculate the electric forces; everything
     else (getting the net force from its components, breaking the forces into their components, finding the direction of
     the net force) is the same as force problems you have done earlier.

     5.4 Electric Field

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the purpose of the electric field concept
         · Describe the properties of the electric field
         · Calculate the field of a collection of source charges of either sign

     As we showed in the preceding section, the net electric force on a test charge is the vector sum of all the electric
     forces acting on it, from all of the various source charges, located at their various positions. But what if we use a
     different test charge, one with a different magnitude, or sign, or both? Or suppose we have a dozen different test
     charges we wish to try at the same location? We would have to calculate the sum of the forces from scratch.
     Fortunately, it is possible to define a quantity, called the electric field, which is independent of the test charge. It
     only depends on the configuration of the source charges, and once found, allows us to calculate the force on any
     test charge.

     Defining a Field

     Suppose we have N source charges  , applying N electrostatic forces on a test charge Q, at

     displacements                    from the source charges. The net force on Q is (see Equation 5.2)

or, more compactly,
                                                                                                                                                       5.4

This expression is called the electric field at position  of the N source charges. Here, P is the location

of the point in space where you are calculating the field and the vectors are the displacements from each source

to the test point (Figure 5.18). Note that we have to impose a coordinate system to solve actual problems.

FIGURE 5.18 Each of these five source charges creates its own electric field at every point in space; shown here are the field vectors at an
arbitrary point P. Like the electric force, the net electric field obeys the superposition principle.

Notice that the calculation of the electric field makes no reference to the test charge. Thus, the physically useful
approach is to calculate the electric field and then use it to calculate the force on some test charge later, if needed.
Different test charges experience different forces Equation 5.3, but it is the same electric field Equation 5.4. That
being said, recall that there is no fundamental difference between a test charge and a source charge; these are
merely convenient labels for the system of interest. Any charge produces an electric field; however, just as Earth's
orbit is not affected by Earth's own gravity, a charge is not subject to a force due to the electric field it generates.
Charges are only subject to forces from the electric fields of other charges.

In this respect, the electric field of a point charge is similar to the gravitational field of Earth; once we have
calculated the gravitational field at some point in space, we can use it any time we want to calculate the resulting
force on any mass we choose to place at that point. In fact, this is exactly what we do when we say the gravitational

field of Earth (near Earth's surface) has a value of      and then we calculate the resulting force (i.e., weight)

on different masses. Also, the general expression for calculating at arbitrary distances from the center of Earth

(i.e., not just near Earth's surface) is very similar to the expression for :  , where G is a proportionality

constant, playing the same role for as  does for . The value of is calculated once and is then used in an

endless number of problems.

To push the analogy further, notice the units of the electric field: From      , the units of E are newtons per

coulomb, N/C, that is, the electric field applies a force on each unit charge. Now notice the units of g: From                                              ,

the units of g are newtons per kilogram, N/kg, that is, the gravitational field applies a force on each unit mass. We

could say that the gravitational field of Earth, near Earth's surface, has a value of 9.81 N/kg.

     The Meaning of "Field"

     Recall from your studies of gravity that the word "field" in this context has a precise meaning. A field, in physics, is a
     physical quantity whose value depends on (is a function of) position, relative to the source of the field. In the case of
     the electric field, Equation 5.4 shows that the value of (both the magnitude and the direction) depends on where
     in space the point P is located, with measured from the locations of the source charges .

     In addition, since the electric field is a vector quantity, the electric field is referred to as a vector field. (The
     gravitational field is also a vector field.) In contrast, a field that has only a magnitude at every point is a scalar field.
     The temperature in a room is an example of a scalar field. It is a field because the temperature, in general, is
     different at different locations in the room, and it is a scalar field because temperature is a scalar quantity.

     Also, as you did with the gravitational field of an object with mass, you should picture the electric field of a charge-
     bearing object (the source charge) as a continuous, immaterial substance that surrounds the source charge, filling

     all of space--in principle, to  in all directions. The field exists at every physical point in space. To put it another

     way, the electric charge on an object alters the space around the charged object in such a way that all other
     electrically charged objects in space experience an electric force as a result of being in that field. The electric field,
     then, is the mechanism by which the electric properties of the source charge are transmitted to and through the rest
     of the universe. (Again, the range of the electric force is infinite.)

     We will see in subsequent chapters that the speed at which electrical phenomena travel is the same as the speed of
     light. There is a deep connection between the electric field and light.

     Superposition

     Yet another experimental fact about the field is that it obeys the superposition principle. In this context, that means
     that we can (in principle) calculate the total electric field of many source charges by calculating the electric field of
     only at position P, then calculate the field of at P, while--and this is the crucial idea--ignoring the field of, and
     indeed even the existence of, We can repeat this process, calculating the field of each individual source charge,
     independently of the existence of any of the other charges. The total electric field, then, is the vector sum of all
     these fields. That, in essence, is what Equation 5.4 says.

     In the next section, we describe how to determine the shape of an electric field of a source charge distribution and
     how to sketch it.

     The Direction of the Field

     Equation 5.4 enables us to determine the magnitude of the electric field, but we need the direction also. We use the
     convention that the direction of any electric field vector is the same as the direction of the electric force vector that
     the field would apply to a positive test charge placed in that field. Such a charge would be repelled by positive
     source charges (the force on it would point away from the positive source charge) but attracted to negative charges
     (the force points toward the negative source).

       DIRECTION OF THE ELECTRIC FIELD

       By convention, all electric fields point away from positive source charges and point toward negative source
       charges.

The E-field of an Atom

In an ionized helium atom, the most probable distance between the nucleus and the electron is
                             . What is the electric field due to the nucleus at the location of the electron?

Strategy
Note that although the electron is mentioned, it is not used in any calculation. The problem asks for an electric field,
not a force; hence, there is only one charge involved, and the problem specifically asks for the field due to the
nucleus. Thus, the electron is a red herring; only its distance matters. Also, since the distance between the two
protons in the nucleus is much, much smaller than the distance of the electron from the nucleus, we can treat the
two protons as a single charge +2e (Figure 5.19).

FIGURE 5.19 A schematic representation of a helium atom. Again, helium physically looks nothing like this, but this sort of diagram is
helpful for calculating the electric field of the nucleus.

Solution
The electric field is calculated by

Since there is only one source charge (the nucleus), this expression simplifies to

Here  (since there are two protons) and r is given; substituting gives

The direction of is radially away from the nucleus in all directions. Why? Because a positive test charge placed in
this field would accelerate radially away from the nucleus (since it is also positively charged), and again, the
convention is that the direction of the electric field vector is defined in terms of the direction of the force it would
apply to positive test charges.

     Strategy
     We add the two fields as vectors, per Equation 5.4. Notice that the system (and therefore the field) is symmetrical
     about the vertical axis; as a result, the horizontal components of the field vectors cancel. This simplifies the math.

The vertical (z)-component is given by

Since none of the other components survive, this is the entire electric field, and it points in the direction.

Notice that this calculation uses the principle of superposition; we calculate the fields of the two charges

independently and then add them together.

easily measure (such as  with quantities that we do know, or can measure. In this case, by geometry,

Significance

It is a very common and very useful technique in physics to check whether your answer is reasonable by evaluating

it at extreme cases. In this example, we should evaluate the field expressions for the cases  ,  , and

 , and confirm that the resulting expressions match our physical expectations. Let's do so:

Let's start with Equation 5.5, the field of two identical charges. From far away (i.e.,       the two source charges
should "merge" and we should then "see" the field of just one charge, of size 2q. So, let          then we can neglect

    in Equation 5.5 to obtain

     which is the correct expression for a field at a distance z away from a charge 2q.

     Next, we consider the field of equal and opposite charges, Equation 5.6. It can be shown (via a Taylor expansion)

     that for     , this becomes

                                                                                                  5.7

     in this expression, since the units of d in the numerator cancel the unit of the "extra" z in the denominator.) If z is

     very large   , then              , as it should; the two charges "merge" and so cancel out.

     5.5 Calculating Electric Fields of Charge Distributions

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain what a continuous source charge distribution is and how it is related to the concept of
             quantization of charge

         · Describe line charges, surface charges, and volume charges
         · Calculate the field of a continuous source charge distribution of either sign

     The charge distributions we have seen so far have been discrete: made up of individual point particles. This is in
     contrast with a continuous charge distribution, which has at least one nonzero dimension. If a charge distribution
     is continuous rather than discrete, we can generalize the definition of the electric field. We simply divide the charge
     into infinitesimal pieces and treat each piece as a point charge.

     Note that because charge is quantized, there is no such thing as a "truly" continuous charge distribution. However,
     in most practical cases, the total charge creating the field involves such a huge number of discrete charges that we
     can safely ignore the discrete nature of the charge and consider it to be continuous. This is exactly the kind of
     approximation we make when we deal with a bucket of water as a continuous fluid, rather than a collection of
     molecules.

     Our first step is to define a charge density for a charge distribution along a line, across a surface, or within a volume,
     as shown in Figure 5.22.

FIGURE 5.22 The configuration of charge differential elements for (a) a line charge, (b) a sheet of charge, and (c) a volume of charge. Also
note that (d) some of the components of the total electric field cancel out, with the remainder resulting in a net electric field.

Definitions of charge density:

·  charge per unit length (linear charge density); units are coulombs per meter (C/m)

·  charge per unit area (surface charge density); units are coulombs per square meter

·  charge per unit volume (volume charge density); units are coulombs per cubic meter

Then, for a line charge, a surface charge, and a volume charge, the summation in Equation 5.4 becomes an integral

and is replaced by              , , or , respectively:

                                                                                                            5.8

                                                                                                            5.9

The integrals are generalizations of the expression for the field of a point charge. They implicitly include and assume
the principle of superposition. The "trick" to using them is almost always in coming up with correct expressions for
dl, dA, or dV, as the case may be, expressed in terms of r, and also expressing the charge density function
appropriately. It may be constant; it might be dependent on location.

Note carefully the meaning of r in these equations: It is the distance from the charge element                                                to

the location of interest,       (the point in space where you want to determine the field). However, don't

confuse this with the meaning of ; we are using it and the vector notation to write three integrals at once. That is,

     Electric Field of a Line Segment

     Find the electric field a distance z above the midpoint of a straight line segment of length L that carries a uniform
     line charge density .

     Strategy

     Since this is a continuous charge distribution, we conceptually break the wire segment into differential pieces of

     length dl, each of which carries a differential amount of charge     . Then, we calculate the differential field

     created by two symmetrically placed pieces of the wire, using the symmetry of the setup to simplify the calculation

     (Figure 5.23). Finally, we integrate this differential field expression over the length of the wire (half of it, actually, as

     we explain below) to obtain the complete electric field expression.

     FIGURE 5.23 A uniformly charged segment of wire. The electric field at point P can be found by applying the superposition principle to
     symmetrically placed charge elements and integrating.

     Solution
     Before we jump into it, what do we expect the field to "look like" from far away? Since it is a finite line segment, from
     far away, it should look like a point charge. We will check the expression we get to see if it meets this expectation.

     The electric field for a line charge is given by the general expression

     The symmetry of the situation (our choice of the two identical differential pieces of charge) implies the horizontal
     (x)-components of the field cancel, so that the net field points in the z-direction. Let's check this formally.

     The total field       is the vector sum of the fields from each of the two charge elements (call them and , for
     now):

     Because the two charge elements are identical and are the same distance away from the point P where we want to

     calculate the field,             so those components cancel. This leaves

where our differential line element dl is dx, in this example, since we are integrating along a line of charge that lies
on the x-axis. (The limits of integration are 0 to , not to , because we have constructed the net field from
two differential pieces of charge dq. If we integrated along the entire length, we would pick up an erroneous factor
of 2.)

In principle, this is complete. However, to actually calculate this integral, we need to eliminate all the variables that
are not given. In this case, both r and change as we integrate outward to the end of the line charge, so those are
the variables to get rid of. We can do that the same way we did for the two point charges: by noticing that

     dimension.

     In the case of a finite line of charge, note that for  , dominates the L in the denominator, so that Equation

     If you recall that       , the total charge on the wire, we have retrieved the expression for the field of a point

     In the limit   , on the other hand, we get the field of an infinite straight wire, which is a straight wire whose

     length is much, much greater than either of its other dimensions, and also much, much greater than the distance at
     which the field is to be calculated:

     To solve surface charge problems, we break the surface into symmetrical differential "strips" that match the shape

     of the surface; here, we'll use rings, as shown in the figure. Again, by symmetry, the horizontal components cancel

     and the field is entirely in the vertical direction. The vertical component of the electric field is extracted by

     multiplying by  , so

Note that this field is constant. This surprising result is, again, an artifact of our limit, although one that we will make
use of repeatedly in the future. To understand why this happens, imagine being placed above an infinite plane of
constant charge. Does the plane look any different if you vary your altitude? No--you still see the plane going off to

     for the electric field. The is because in the figure, the field is pointing in the +x-direction.

     Significance
     Systems that may be approximated as two infinite planes of this sort provide a useful means of creating uniform
     electric fields.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the purpose of an electric field diagram
         · Describe the relationship between a vector diagram and a field line diagram
         · Explain the rules for creating a field diagram and why these rules make physical sense
         · Sketch the field of an arbitrary source charge

     Now that we have some experience calculating electric fields, let's try to gain some insight into the geometry of
     electric fields. As mentioned earlier, our model is that the charge on an object (the source charge) alters space in the
     region around it in such a way that when another charged object (the test charge) is placed in that region of space,
     that test charge experiences an electric force. The concept of electric field lines, and of electric field line diagrams,
     enables us to visualize the way in which the space is altered, allowing us to visualize the field. The purpose of this
     section is to enable you to create sketches of this geometry, so we will list the specific steps and rules involved in
     creating an accurate and useful sketch of an electric field.

     It is important to remember that electric fields are three-dimensional. Although in this book we include some
     pseudo-three-dimensional images, several of the diagrams that you'll see (both here, and in subsequent chapters)
     will be two-dimensional projections, or cross-sections. Always keep in mind that in fact, you're looking at a three-
     dimensional phenomenon.

     Our starting point is the physical fact that the electric field of the source charge causes a test charge in that field to
     experience a force. By definition, electric field vectors point in the same direction as the electric force that a
     (hypothetical) positive test charge would experience, if placed in the field (Figure 5.27)

FIGURE 5.27 The electric field of a positive point charge. A large number of field vectors are shown. Like all vector arrows, the length of
each vector is proportional to the magnitude of the field at each point. (a) Field in two dimensions; (b) field in three dimensions.

We've plotted many field vectors in the figure, which are distributed uniformly around the source charge. Since the
electric field is a vector, the arrows that we draw correspond at every point in space to both the magnitude and the
direction of the field at that point. As always, the length of the arrow that we draw corresponds to the magnitude of
the field vector at that point. For a point source charge, the length decreases by the square of the distance from the
source charge. In addition, the direction of the field vector is radially away from the source charge, because the
direction of the electric field is defined by the direction of the force that a positive test charge would experience in
that field. (Again, keep in mind that the actual field is three-dimensional; there are also field lines pointing out of and
into the page.)

This diagram is correct, but it becomes less useful as the source charge distribution becomes more complicated. For
example, consider the vector field diagram of a dipole (Figure 5.28).
200  5 · Electric Charges and Fields

        FIGURE 5.28 The vector field of a dipole. Even with just two identical charges, the vector field diagram becomes difficult to understand.

     There is a more useful way to present the same information. Rather than drawing a large number of increasingly
     smaller vector arrows, we instead connect all of them together, forming continuous lines and curves, as shown in
     Figure 5.29.

     FIGURE 5.29 (a) The electric field line diagram of a positive point charge. (b) The field line diagram of a dipole. In both diagrams, the
     magnitude of the field is indicated by the field line density. The field vectors (not shown here) are everywhere tangent to the field lines.

     Although it may not be obvious at first glance, these field diagrams convey the same information about the electric
     field as do the vector diagrams. First, the direction of the field at every point is simply the direction of the field vector
     at that same point. In other words, at any point in space, the field vector at each point is tangent to the field line at
     that same point. The arrowhead placed on a field line indicates its direction.
     As for the magnitude of the field, that is indicated by the field line density--that is, the number of field lines per unit
     area passing through a small cross-sectional area perpendicular to the electric field. This field line density is drawn
     to be proportional to the magnitude of the field at that cross-section. As a result, if the field lines are close together
     (that is, the field line density is greater), this indicates that the magnitude of the field is large at that point. If the
     field lines are far apart at the cross-section, this indicates the magnitude of the field is small. Figure 5.30 shows the

FIGURE 5.30 Electric field lines passing through imaginary areas. Since the number of lines passing through each area is the same, but the
areas themselves are different, the field line density is different. This indicates different magnitudes of the electric field at these points.

In Figure 5.30, the same number of field lines passes through both surfaces (S and but the surface S is larger
than surface . Therefore, the density of field lines (number of lines per unit area) is larger at the location of ,
indicating that the electric field is stronger at the location of than at S. The rules for creating an electric field
diagram are as follows.

        PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Drawing Electric Field Lines

  1. Electric field lines either originate on positive charges or come in from infinity, and either terminate on
        negative charges or extend out to infinity.

  2. The number of field lines originating or terminating at a charge is proportional to the magnitude of that charge.
       A charge of 2q will have twice as many lines as a charge of q.

  3. At every point in space, the field vector at that point is tangent to the field line at that same point.
  4. The field line density at any point in space is proportional to (and therefore is representative of) the magnitude

        of the field at that point in space.
  5. Field lines can never cross. Since a field line represents the direction of the field at a given point, if two field

        lines crossed at some point, that would imply that the electric field was pointing in two different directions at a
        single point. This in turn would suggest that the (net) force on a test charge placed at that point would point in
        two different directions. Since this is obviously impossible, it follows that field lines must never cross.

Always keep in mind that field lines serve only as a convenient way to visualize the electric field; they are not
physical entities. Although the direction and relative intensity of the electric field can be deduced from a set of field
lines, the lines can also be misleading. For example, the field lines drawn to represent the electric field in a region
must, by necessity, be discrete. However, the actual electric field in that region exists at every point in space.
202  5 · Electric Charges and Fields

     Field lines for three groups of discrete charges are shown in Figure 5.31. Since the charges in parts (a) and (b) have
     the same magnitude, the same number of field lines are shown starting from or terminating on each charge. In (c),
     however, we draw three times as many field lines leaving the charge as entering the . The field lines that do
     not terminate at emanate outward from the charge configuration, to infinity.

     magnitudes. Can you tell from the diagram which charge has the larger magnitude?

     The ability to construct an accurate electric field diagram is an important, useful skill; it makes it much easier to
     estimate, predict, and therefore calculate the electric field of a source charge. The best way to develop this skill is
     with software that allows you to place source charges and then will draw the net field upon request. We strongly
     urge you to search the Internet for a program. Once you've found one you like, run several simulations to get the
     essential ideas of field diagram construction. Then practice drawing field diagrams, and checking your predictions
     with the computer-drawn diagrams.

     5.7 Electric Dipoles

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe a permanent dipole
         · Describe an induced dipole
         · Define and calculate an electric dipole moment
         · Explain the physical meaning of the dipole moment

     Earlier we discussed, and calculated, the electric field of a dipole: two equal and opposite charges that are "close"
     to each other. (In this context, "close" means that the distance d between the two charges is much, much less than
     the distance of the field point P, the location where you are calculating the field.) Let's now consider what happens
     to a dipole when it is placed in an external field . We assume that the dipole is a permanent dipole; it exists
     without the field, and does not break apart in the external field.

     Rotation of a Dipole due to an Electric Field

     For now, we deal with only the simplest case: The external field is uniform in space. Suppose we have the situation
     depicted in Figure 5.32, where we denote the distance between the charges as the vector pointing from the
     negative charge to the positive charge. The forces on the two charges are equal and opposite, so there is no net
     force on the dipole. However, there is a torque about the midpoint between the two charges:

FIGURE 5.32 A dipole in an external electric field. (a) The net force on the dipole is zero, but the net torque is not. As a result, the dipole
rotates, becoming aligned with the external field. (b) The dipole moment is a convenient way to characterize this effect. The points in the
same direction as .

The quantity (the magnitude of each charge multiplied by the vector distance between them) is a property of the
dipole; its value, as you can see, determines the torque that the dipole experiences in the external field. It is useful,
therefore, to define this product as the so-called dipole moment of the dipole:

                                                                                                                                                     5.16

We can therefore write

                        5.17

Recall that a torque changes the angular velocity of an object, the dipole, in this case. In this situation, the effect is
to rotate the dipole (that is, align the direction of so that it is parallel to the direction of the external field.

Induced Dipoles

Neutral atoms are, by definition, electrically neutral; they have equal amounts of positive and negative charge.
Furthermore, since they are spherically symmetrical, they do not have a "built-in" dipole moment the way most
asymmetrical molecules do. They obtain one, however, when placed in an external electric field, because the
external field causes oppositely directed forces on the positive nucleus of the atom versus the negative electrons
that surround the nucleus. The result is a new charge distribution of the atom, and therefore, an induced dipole
moment (Figure 5.33).
204  5 · Electric Charges and Fields

     FIGURE 5.33 A dipole is induced in a neutral atom by an external electric field. The induced dipole moment is aligned with the external
     field.

     An important fact here is that, just as for a rotated polar molecule, the result is that the dipole moment ends up
     aligned parallel to the external electric field. Generally, the magnitude of an induced dipole is much smaller than
     that of an inherent dipole. For both kinds of dipoles, notice that once the alignment of the dipole (rotated or induced)

     is complete, the net effect is to decrease the total electric field  in the regions inside the

     dipole charges (Figure 5.34). By "inside" we mean in between the charges. This effect is crucial for capacitors, as
     you will see in Capacitance.

                                FIGURE 5.34 The net electric field is the vector sum of the field of the dipole plus the external field.

     Recall that we found the electric field of a dipole in Equation 5.7. If we rewrite it in terms of the dipole moment we
     get:

     The form of this field is shown in Figure 5.34. Notice that along the plane perpendicular to the axis of the dipole and
     midway between the charges, the direction of the electric field is opposite that of the dipole and gets weaker the
     further from the axis one goes. Similarly, on the axis of the dipole (but outside it), the field points in the same
     direction as the dipole, again getting weaker the further one gets from the charges.

Gauss's Law

FIGURE 6.1 This chapter introduces the concept of flux, which relates a physical quantity and the area through which it is flowing.
Although we introduce this concept with the electric field, the concept may be used for many other quantities, such as fluid flow. (credit:

CHAPTER OUTLINE
6.1 Electric Flux
6.2 Explaining Gauss's Law
6.3 Applying Gauss's Law
6.4 Conductors in Electrostatic Equilibrium

INTRODUCTION Flux is a general and broadly applicable concept in physics. However, in this chapter, we
concentrate on the flux of the electric field. This allows us to introduce Gauss's law, which is particularly useful for
finding the electric fields of charge distributions exhibiting spatial symmetry. The main topics discussed here are

  1. Electric flux. We define electric flux for both open and closed surfaces.
  2. Gauss's law. We derive Gauss's law for an arbitrary charge distribution and examine the role of electric flux in

        Gauss's law.
  3. Calculating electric fields with Gauss's law. The main focus of this chapter is to explain how to use Gauss's

        law to find the electric fields of spatially symmetrical charge distributions. We discuss the importance of
        choosing a Gaussian surface and provide examples involving the applications of Gauss's law.
  4. Electric fields in conductors. Gauss's law provides useful insight into the absence of electric fields in
        conducting materials.
So far, we have found that the electrostatic field begins and ends at point charges and that the field of a point charge
varies inversely with the square of the distance from that charge. These characteristics of the electrostatic field lead
to an important mathematical relationship known as Gauss's law. This law is named in honor of the extraordinary
German mathematician and scientist Karl Friedrich Gauss (Figure 6.2). Gauss's law gives us an elegantly simple way
of finding the electric field, and, as you will see, it can be much easier to use than the integration method described
in the previous chapter. However, there is a catch--Gauss's law has a limitation in that, while always true, it can be

     readily applied only for charge distributions with certain symmetries.

     were to the field of mathematics, he also did important work in physics and astronomy.

     6.1 Electric Flux

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define the concept of flux
         · Describe electric flux
         · Calculate electric flux for a given situation

     The concept of flux describes how much of something goes through a given area. More formally, it is the dot product
     of a vector field (in this chapter, the electric field) with an area. You may conceptualize the flux of an electric field as
     a measure of the number of electric field lines passing through an area (Figure 6.3). The larger the area, the more
     field lines go through it and, hence, the greater the flux; similarly, the stronger the electric field is (represented by a
     greater density of lines), the greater the flux. On the other hand, if the area is rotated so that the plane is aligned
     with the field lines, none will pass through and there will be no flux.

     FIGURE 6.3 The flux of an electric field through the shaded area captures information about the "number" of electric field lines passing
     through the area. The numerical value of the electric flux depends on the magnitudes of the electric field and the area, as well as the
     relative orientation of the area with respect to the direction of the electric field.

     A macroscopic analogy that might help you imagine this is to put a hula hoop in a flowing river. As you change the
     angle of the hoop relative to the direction of the current, more or less of the flow will go through the hoop. Similarly,
     the amount of flow through the hoop depends on the strength of the current and the size of the hoop. Again, flux is a
     general concept; we can also use it to describe the amount of sunlight hitting a solar panel or the amount of energy a
     telescope receives from a distant star, for example.

     To quantify this idea, Figure 6.4(a) shows a planar surface of area that is perpendicular to the uniform

     electric field   If N field lines pass through , then we know from the definition of electric field lines

The quantity  is the electric flux through . We represent the electric flux through an open surface like by

the symbol . Electric flux is a scalar quantity and has an SI unit of newton-meters squared per coulomb

(  ). Notice that                   may also be written as  , demonstrating that electric flux is a measure of

the number of field lines crossing a surface.

FIGURE 6.4 (a) A planar surface of area is perpendicular to the electric field . N field lines cross surface . (b) A surface of
area whose projection onto the xz-plane is .The same number of field lines cross each surface.

Now consider a planar surface that is not perpendicular to the field. How would we represent the electric flux?

Figure 6.4(b) shows a surface of area that is inclined at an angle to the xz-plane and whose projection in

that plane is (area ). The areas are related by             Because the same number of field lines crosses

both and , the fluxes through both surfaces must be the same. The flux through is therefore

                   Designating as a unit vector normal to (see Figure 6.4(b)), we obtain

Check out this video (https://openstax.org/l/21fluxsizeangl) to observe what happens to the flux as the area
changes in size and angle, or the electric field changes in strength.

Area Vector

For discussing the flux of a vector field, it is helpful to introduce an area vector This allows us to write the last
equation in a more compact form. What should the magnitude of the area vector be? What should the direction of
the area vector be? What are the implications of how you answer the previous question?
The area vector of a flat surface of area A has the following magnitude and direction:

    · Magnitude is equal to area (A)
    · Direction is along the normal to the surface ( ); that is, perpendicular to the surface.
Since the normal to a flat surface can point in either direction from the surface, the direction of the area vector of an
open surface needs to be chosen, as shown in Figure 6.5.

FIGURE 6.5 The direction of the area vector of an open surface needs to be chosen; it could be either of the two cases displayed here. The
area vector of a part of a closed surface is defined to point from the inside of the closed space to the outside. This rule gives a unique

     direction.

     Since is a unit normal to a surface, it has two possible directions at every point on that surface (Figure 6.6(a)). For
     an open surface, we can use either direction, as long as we are consistent over the entire surface. Part (c) of the
     figure shows several cases.

     FIGURE 6.6 (a) Two potential normal vectors arise at every point on a surface. (b) The outward normal is used to calculate the flux through
     a closed surface. (c) Only has been given a consistent set of normal vectors that allows us to define the flux through the surface.

     However, if a surface is closed, then the surface encloses a volume. In that case, the direction of the normal vector
     at any point on the surface points from the inside to the outside. On a closed surface such as that of Figure 6.6(b),
     is chosen to be the outward normal at every point, to be consistent with the sign convention for electric charge.

     Electric Flux

     Now that we have defined the area vector of a surface, we can define the electric flux of a uniform electric field
     through a flat area as the scalar product of the electric field and the area vector, as defined in Products of Vectors
     (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/2-4-products-of-vectors):

                                                                                                                                                            6.1

     Figure 6.7 shows the electric field of an oppositely charged, parallel-plate system and an imaginary box between the
     plates. The electric field between the plates is uniform and points from the positive plate toward the negative plate.
     A calculation of the flux of this field through various faces of the box shows that the net flux through the box is zero.
     Why does the flux cancel out here?

FIGURE 6.7 Electric flux through a cube, placed between two charged plates. Electric flux through the bottom face (ABCD) is negative,
because is in the opposite direction to the normal to the surface. The electric flux through the top face (FGHK) is positive, because the
electric field and the normal are in the same direction. The electric flux through the other faces is zero, since the electric field is
perpendicular to the normal vectors of those faces. The net electric flux through the cube is the sum of fluxes through the six faces. Here,
the net flux through the cube is equal to zero. The magnitude of the flux through rectangle BCKF is equal to the magnitudes of the flux
through both the top and bottom faces.

The reason is that the sources of the electric field are outside the box. Therefore, if any electric field line enters the
volume of the box, it must also exit somewhere on the surface because there is no charge inside for the lines to land
on. Therefore, quite generally, electric flux through a closed surface is zero if there are no sources of electric field,
whether positive or negative charges, inside the enclosed volume. In general, when field lines leave (or "flow out
of") a closed surface, is positive; when they enter (or "flow into") the surface, is negative.
Any smooth, non-flat surface can be replaced by a collection of tiny, approximately flat surfaces, as shown in Figure
6.8. If we divide a surface S into small patches, then we notice that, as the patches become smaller, they can be
approximated by flat surfaces. This is similar to the way we treat the surface of Earth as locally flat, even though we
know that globally, it is approximately spherical.

                                                     FIGURE 6.8 A surface is divided into patches to find the flux.

To keep track of the patches, we can number them from 1 through N . Now, we define the area vector for each patch
224  6 · Gauss's Law

     as the area of the patch pointed in the direction of the normal. Let us denote the area vector for the ith patch by
            (We have used the symbol to remind us that the area is of an arbitrarily small patch.) With sufficiently small

     patches, we may approximate the electric field over any given patch as uniform. Let us denote the average electric
     field at the location of the ith patch by

     Therefore, we can write the electric flux through the area of the ith patch as

     The flux through each of the individual patches can be constructed in this manner and then added to give us an
     estimate of the net flux through the entire surface S, which we denote simply as .

     This estimate of the flux gets better as we decrease the size of the patches. However, when you use smaller
     patches, you need more of them to cover the same surface. In the limit of infinitesimally small patches, they may be
     considered to have area dA and unit normal . Since the elements are infinitesimal, they may be assumed to be
     planar, and may be taken as constant over any element. Then the flux through an area dA is given by

                            It is positive when the angle between and is less than and negative when the angle is
     greater than . The net flux is the sum of the infinitesimal flux elements over the entire surface. With
     infinitesimally small patches, you need infinitely many patches, and the limit of the sum becomes a surface integral.
     With representing the integral over S,

                                                                                                                                                            6.2

     In practical terms, surface integrals are computed by taking the antiderivatives of both dimensions defining the
     area, with the edges of the surface in question being the bounds of the integral.
     To distinguish between the flux through an open surface like that of Figure 6.4 and the flux through a closed surface
     (one that completely bounds some volume), we represent flux through a closed surface by

                                                                                                                                                            6.3

     where the circle through the integral symbol simply means that the surface is closed, and we are integrating over
     the entire thing. If you only integrate over a portion of a closed surface, that means you are treating a subset of it as
     an open surface.

     6.2 Explaining Gauss's Law

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · State Gauss's law
         · Explain the conditions under which Gauss's law may be used
         · Apply Gauss's law in appropriate systems

     We can now determine the electric flux through an arbitrary closed surface due to an arbitrary charge distribution.
     We found that if a closed surface does not have any charge inside where an electric field line can terminate, then any
     electric field line entering the surface at one point must necessarily exit at some other point of the surface.
     Therefore, if a closed surface does not have any charges inside the enclosed volume, then the electric flux through
     the surface is zero. Now, what happens to the electric flux if there are some charges inside the enclosed volume?
     Gauss's law gives a quantitative answer to this question.

     To get a feel for what to expect, let's calculate the electric flux through a spherical surface around a positive point
     charge q, since we already know the electric field in such a situation. Recall that when we place the point charge at
     the origin of a coordinate system, the electric field at a point P that is at a distance r from the charge at the origin is
     given by

     where is the radial unit vector from the charge at the origin to the point P. We can use this electric field to find the
     flux through the spherical surface of radius R, as shown in Figure 6.13.

                                      FIGURE 6.13 A closed spherical surface surrounding a point charge q.

     Then we apply                    to this system and substitute known values. On the sphere,            and  , so
     for an infinitesimal area dA,

     We now find the net flux by integrating this flux over the surface of the sphere:

where the total surface area of the spherical surface is  This gives the flux through the closed spherical
surface at radius r as                                                                                                       6.4

A remarkable fact about this equation is that the flux is independent of the size of the spherical surface. This can be
directly attributed to the fact that the electric field of a point charge decreases as with distance, which just
cancels the rate of increase of the surface area.

Electric Field Lines Picture

An alternative way to see why the flux through a closed spherical surface is independent of the radius of the surface
is to look at the electric field lines. Note that every field line from q that pierces the surface at radius also pierces
the surface at (Figure 6.14).

FIGURE 6.14 Flux through spherical surfaces of radii and enclosing a charge q are equal, independent of the size of the surface,
since all E-field lines that pierce one surface from the inside to outside direction also pierce the other surface in the same direction.

Therefore, the net number of electric field lines passing through the two surfaces from the inside to outside
direction is equal. This net number of electric field lines, which is obtained by subtracting the number of lines in the
direction from outside to inside from the number of lines in the direction from inside to outside gives a visual
measure of the electric flux through the surfaces.

You can see that if no charges are included within a closed surface, then the electric flux through it must be zero. A

typical field line enters the surface at  and leaves at   Every line that enters the surface must also leave that

surface. Hence the net "flow" of the field lines into or out of the surface is zero (Figure 6.15(a)). The same thing

happens if charges of equal and opposite sign are included inside the closed surface, so that the total charge

included is zero (part (b)). A surface that includes the same amount of charge has the same number of field lines

crossing it, regardless of the shape or size of the surface, as long as the surface encloses the same amount of charge

(part (c)).
230  6 · Gauss's Law

     FIGURE 6.15 Understanding the flux in terms of field lines. (a) The electric flux through a closed surface due to a charge outside that
     surface is zero. (b) Charges are enclosed, but because the net charge included is zero, the net flux through the closed surface is also zero.
     (c) The shape and size of the surfaces that enclose a charge does not matter because all surfaces enclosing the same charge have the same
     flux.

     Statement of Gauss's Law

     Gauss's law generalizes this result to the case of any number of charges and any location of the charges in the space

     inside the closed surface. According to Gauss's law, the flux of the electric field through any closed surface, also

     called a Gaussian surface, is equal to the net charge enclosed  divided by the permittivity of free space :

     This equation holds for charges of either sign, because we define the area vector of a closed surface to point

     outward. If the enclosed charge is negative (see Figure 6.16(b)), then the flux through either  is negative.

     FIGURE 6.16 The electric flux through any closed surface surrounding a point charge q is given by Gauss's law. (a) Enclosed charge is
     positive. (b) Enclosed charge is negative.

     The Gaussian surface does not need to correspond to a real, physical object; indeed, it rarely will. It is a
     mathematical construct that may be of any shape, provided that it is closed. However, since our goal is to integrate

the flux over it, we tend to choose shapes that are highly symmetrical.

If the charges are discrete point charges, then we just add them. If the charge is described by a continuous

distribution, then we need to integrate appropriately to find the total charge that resides inside the enclosed volume.

For example, the flux through the Gaussian surface S of Figure 6.17 is   Note that is

simply the sum of the point charges. If the charge distribution were continuous, we would need to integrate

appropriately to compute the total charge within the Gaussian surface.

              FIGURE 6.17 The flux through the Gaussian surface shown, due to the charge distribution, is

Recall that the principle of superposition holds for the electric field. Therefore, the total electric field at any point,
including those on the chosen Gaussian surface, is the sum of all the electric fields present at this point. This allows
us to write Gauss's law in terms of the total electric field.

GAUSS'S LAW

The flux of the electric field through any closed surface S (a Gaussian surface) is equal to the net charge

enclosed  divided by the permittivity of free space

                                                                                                              6.5

To use Gauss's law effectively, you must have a clear understanding of what each term in the equation represents.

The field is the total electric field at every point on the Gaussian surface. This total field includes contributions
from charges both inside and outside the Gaussian surface. However, is just the charge inside the Gaussian
surface. Finally, the Gaussian surface is any closed surface in space. That surface can coincide with the actual
surface of a conductor, or it can be an imaginary geometric surface. The only requirement imposed on a Gaussian
surface is that it be closed (Figure 6.18).

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain what spherical, cylindrical, and planar symmetry are
         · Recognize whether or not a given system possesses one of these symmetries
         · Apply Gauss's law to determine the electric field of a system with one of these symmetries

     Gauss's law is very helpful in determining expressions for the electric field, even though the law is not directly about
     the electric field; it is about the electric flux. It turns out that in situations that have certain symmetries (spherical,
     cylindrical, or planar) in the charge distribution, we can deduce the electric field based on knowledge of the electric
     flux. In these systems, we can find a Gaussian surface S over which the electric field has constant magnitude.

     Furthermore, if is parallel to everywhere on the surface, then                    (If and are antiparallel

     everywhere on the surface, then  ) Gauss's law then simplifies to

                                                                                                                  6.6

     where A is the area of the surface. Note that these symmetries lead to the transformation of the flux integral into a
     product of the magnitude of the electric field and an appropriate area. When you use this flux in the expression for
     Gauss's law, you obtain an algebraic equation that you can solve for the magnitude of the electric field, which looks
     like

     The direction of the electric field at point P is obtained from the symmetry of the charge distribution and the type of

     charge in the distribution. Therefore, Gauss's law can be used to determine       Here is a summary of the steps we
     will follow:

     PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Gauss's Law

       1. Identify the spatial symmetry of the charge distribution. This is an important first step that allows us to choose
             the appropriate Gaussian surface. As examples, an isolated point charge has spherical symmetry, and an
             infinite line of charge has cylindrical symmetry.

       2. Choose a Gaussian surface with the same symmetry as the charge distribution and identify its consequences.

     With this choice,                is easily determined over the Gaussian surface.

     3. Evaluate the integral         over the Gaussian surface, that is, calculate the flux through the surface.

     The symmetry of the Gaussian surface allows us to factor        outside the integral.

     4. Determine the amount of charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface. This is an evaluation of the right-hand side

     of the equation representing Gauss's law. It is often necessary to perform an integration to obtain the net

     enclosed charge.

     5. Evaluate the electric field of the charge distribution. The field may now be found using the results of steps 3

     and 4.

                                                              6.3 · Applying Gauss's Law                                                                    235

Basically, there are only three types of symmetry that allow Gauss's law to be used to deduce the electric field. They
are

· A charge distribution with spherical symmetry
· A charge distribution with cylindrical symmetry
· A charge distribution with planar symmetry

To exploit the symmetry, we perform the calculations in appropriate coordinate systems and use the right kind of
Gaussian surface for that symmetry, applying the remaining four steps.

Charge Distribution with Spherical Symmetry

A charge distribution has spherical symmetry if the density of charge depends only on the distance from a point in

space and not on the direction. In other words, if you rotate the system, it doesn't look different. For instance, if a

sphere of radius R is uniformly charged with charge density then the distribution has spherical symmetry (Figure

6.21(a)). On the other hand, if a sphere of radius R is charged so that the top half of the sphere has uniform charge

density and the bottom half has a uniform charge density      then the sphere does not have spherical

symmetry because the charge density depends on the direction (Figure 6.21(b)). Thus, it is not the shape of the

object but rather the shape of the charge distribution that determines whether or not a system has spherical

symmetry.

Figure 6.21(c) shows a sphere with four different shells, each with its own uniform charge density. Although this is a
situation where charge density in the full sphere is not uniform, the charge density function depends only on the
distance from the center and not on the direction. Therefore, this charge distribution does have spherical symmetry.

FIGURE 6.21 Illustrations of spherically symmetrical and nonsymmetrical systems. Different shadings indicate different charge densities.
Charges on spherically shaped objects do not necessarily mean the charges are distributed with spherical symmetry. The spherical
symmetry occurs only when the charge density does not depend on the direction. In (a), charges are distributed uniformly in a sphere. In
(b), the upper half of the sphere has a different charge density from the lower half; therefore, (b) does not have spherical symmetry. In (c),
the charges are in spherical shells of different charge densities, which means that charge density is only a function of the radial distance
from the center; therefore, the system has spherical symmetry.

One good way to determine whether or not your problem has spherical symmetry is to look at the charge density

function in spherical coordinates,  . If the charge density is only a function of r, that is  , then you

have spherical symmetry. If the density depends on or , you could change it by rotation; hence, you would not

have spherical symmetry.

Consequences of symmetry
In all spherically symmetrical cases, the electric field at any point must be radially directed, because the charge and,
hence, the field must be invariant under rotation. Therefore, using spherical coordinates with their origins at the
center of the spherical charge distribution, we can write down the expected form of the electric field at a point P
located at a distance r from the center:

                                                                                                                                                       6.7

where is the unit vector pointed in the direction from the origin to the field point P. The radial component of

the electric field can be positive or negative. When      the electric field at P points away from the origin, and

when       the electric field at P points toward the origin.

     Gaussian surface and flux calculations
     We can now use this form of the electric field to obtain the flux of the electric field through the Gaussian surface. For
     spherical symmetry, the Gaussian surface is a closed spherical surface that has the same center as the center of the
     charge distribution. Thus, the direction of the area vector of an area element on the Gaussian surface at any point is
     parallel to the direction of the electric field at that point, assuming the net charge is positive resulting in both vectors
     pointing radially directed outward (Figure 6.22). If the net charge was negative inside the Gaussian surface, the
     electric field would point antiparallel to the area vector.

     FIGURE 6.22 The electric field at any point of the spherical Gaussian surface for a spherically symmetrical charge distribution is parallel to
     the area element vector at that point, giving flux as the product of the magnitude of electric field and the value of the area. Note that the
     radius R of the charge distribution and the radius r of the Gaussian surface are different quantities.

     The magnitude of the electric field must be the same everywhere on a spherical Gaussian surface concentric with
     the distribution. For a spherical surface of radius r,

     Using Gauss's law
     According to Gauss's law, the flux through a closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed within the closed
     surface divided by the permittivity of vacuum . Let be the total charge enclosed inside the distance r from the
     origin, which is the space inside the Gaussian spherical surface of radius r. This gives the following relation for
     Gauss's law:

     Hence, the electric field at point P that is a distance r from the center of a spherically symmetrical charge
     distribution has the following magnitude and direction:

                                                                                                                                                            6.8

     Direction: radial from O to P or from P to O.
     The direction of the field at point P depends on whether the charge in the sphere is positive or negative. For a net
     positive charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface, the direction is from O to P, and for a net negative charge, the
     direction is from P to O. This is all we need for a point charge, and you will notice that the result above is identical to
     that for a point charge. However, Gauss's law becomes truly useful in cases where the charge occupies a finite
     volume.
     Computing enclosed charge

field inside the charge distribution thus becomes relevant. In this case, the charge enclosed depends on the
distance r of the field point relative to the radius of the charge distribution R, such as that shown in Figure 6.23.

FIGURE 6.23 A spherically symmetrical charge distribution and the Gaussian surface used for finding the field (a) inside and (b) outside the

If point P is located outside the charge distribution--that is, if  --then the Gaussian surface containing P

encloses all charges in the sphere. In this case, equals the total charge in the sphere. On the other hand, if point

P is within the spherical charge distribution, that is, if  then the Gaussian surface encloses a smaller sphere

than the sphere of charge distribution. In this case, is less than the total charge present in the sphere. Referring

to Figure 6.23, we can write as

The field at a point outside the charge distribution is also called , and the field at a point inside the charge
distribution is called Focusing on the two types of field points, either inside or outside the charge distribution,
we can now write the magnitude of the electric field as

                                                                                                                                                       6.9

Note that the electric field outside a spherically symmetrical charge distribution is identical to that of a point charge
at the center that has a charge equal to the total charge of the spherical charge distribution. This is remarkable since
the charges are not located at the center only. We now work out specific examples of spherical charge distributions,
starting with the case of a uniformly charged sphere.

             and a point inside the sphere, labeled

     It is interesting to note that the magnitude of the electric field increases inside the material as you go out, since the

     amount of charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface increases with the volume. Specifically, the charge enclosed

     grows , whereas the field from each infinitesimal element of charge drops off  with the net result that the

     electric field within the distribution increases in strength linearly with the radius. The magnitude of the electric field

     outside the sphere decreases as you go away from the charges, because the included charge remains the same but

     the distance increases. Figure 6.24 displays the variation of the magnitude of the electric field with distance from

     the center of a uniformly charged sphere.

Significance

Notice that   has the same form as the equation of the electric field of an isolated point charge. In determining

the electric field of a uniform spherical charge distribution, we can therefore assume that all of the charge inside the

appropriate spherical Gaussian surface is located at the center of the distribution.

        EXAMPLE 6.7

Non-Uniformly Charged Sphere

A non-conducting sphere of radius R has a non-uniform charge density that varies with the distance from its center
as given by

where a is a constant. We require  so that the charge density is not undefined at     . Find the electric field at

a point outside the sphere and at a point inside the sphere.

Strategy
Apply the Gauss's law strategy given above, where we work out the enclosed charge integrals separately for cases
inside and outside the sphere.

Solution

Since the given charge density function has only a radial dependence and no dependence on direction, we have a

spherically symmetrical situation. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at any point is given above and the

direction is radial. We just need to find the enclosed charge  which depends on the location of the field point.

A note about symbols: We use for locating charges in the charge distribution and r for locating the field point(s) at
the Gaussian surface(s). The letter R is used for the radius of the charge distribution.

As charge density is not constant here, we need to integrate the charge density function over the volume enclosed
240  6 · Gauss's Law

     by the Gaussian surface. Therefore, we set up the problem for charges in one spherical shell, say between and
                 as shown in Figure 6.26. The volume of charges in the shell of infinitesimal width is equal to the product of

     the area of surface  and the thickness        . Multiplying the volume with the density at this location, which is

     , gives the charge in the shell:

     FIGURE 6.26 Spherical symmetry with non-uniform charge distribution. In this type of problem, we need four radii: R is the radius of the

     charge distribution, r is the radius of the Gaussian surface, is the inner radius of the spherical shell, and  is the outer radius of the

     spherical shell. The spherical shell is used to calculate the charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. The range for is from 0 to r for

     the field at a point inside the charge distribution and from 0 to R for the field at a point outside the charge distribution. If  , then the

     Gaussian surface encloses more volume than the charge distribution, but the additional volume does not contribute to .

     (a) Field at a point outside the charge distribution. In this case, the Gaussian surface, which contains the field

     point P, has a radius r that is greater than the radius R of the charge distribution,  . Therefore, all charges of the

     charge distribution are enclosed within the Gaussian surface. Note that the space between                      and                is

     empty of charges and therefore does not contribute to the integral over the volume enclosed by the Gaussian

Charge Distribution with Cylindrical Symmetry

A charge distribution has cylindrical symmetry if the charge density depends only upon the distance r from the axis
of a cylinder and must not vary along the axis or with direction about the axis. In other words, if your system varies if
you rotate it around the axis, or shift it along the axis, you do not have cylindrical symmetry.

Figure 6.27 shows four situations in which charges are distributed in a cylinder. A uniform charge density in an

infinite straight wire has a cylindrical symmetry, and so does an infinitely long cylinder with constant charge density

An infinitely long cylinder that has different charge densities along its length, such as a charge density for

and  for               , does not have a usable cylindrical symmetry for this course. Neither does a cylinder in

which charge density varies with the direction, such as a charge density for   and              for

     . A system with concentric cylindrical shells, each with uniform charge densities, albeit different in

different shells, as in Figure 6.27(d), does have cylindrical symmetry if they are infinitely long. The infinite length

requirement is due to the charge density changing along the axis of a finite cylinder. In real systems, we don't have

infinite cylinders; however, if the cylindrical object is considerably longer than the radius from it that we are

interested in, then the approximation of an infinite cylinder becomes useful.

FIGURE 6.27 To determine whether a given charge distribution has cylindrical symmetry, look at the cross-section of an "infinitely long"
cylinder. If the charge density does not depend on the polar angle of the cross-section or along the axis, then you have cylindrical
symmetry. (a) Charge density is constant in the cylinder; (b) upper half of the cylinder has a different charge density from the lower half; (c)
left half of the cylinder has a different charge density from the right half; (d) charges are constant in different cylindrical rings, but the
density does not depend on the polar angle. Cases (a) and (d) have cylindrical symmetry, whereas (b) and (c) do not.

Consequences of symmetry                                    at any point P must also display cylindrical symmetry.
In all cylindrically symmetrical cases, the electric field

     FIGURE 6.28 The electric field in a cylindrically symmetrical situation depends only on the distance from the axis. The direction of the
     electric field is pointed away from the axis for positive charges and toward the axis for negative charges.

     Gaussian surface and flux calculation
     To make use of the direction and functional dependence of the electric field, we choose a closed Gaussian surface in
     the shape of a cylinder with the same axis as the axis of the charge distribution. The flux through this surface of
     radius s and height L is easy to compute if we divide our task into two parts: (a) a flux through the flat ends and (b) a
     flux through the curved surface (Figure 6.29).

     FIGURE 6.29 The Gaussian surface in the case of cylindrical symmetry. The electric field at a patch is either parallel or perpendicular to the
     normal to the patch of the Gaussian surface.

     The electric field is perpendicular to the cylindrical side and parallel to the planar end caps of the surface. The flux
     through the cylindrical part is

     whereas the flux through the end caps is zero because               there. Thus, the flux is

     Using Gauss's law

     According to Gauss's law, the flux must equal the amount of charge within the volume enclosed by this surface,

     divided by the permittivity of free space. When you do the calculation for a cylinder of length L, you find that of

     Gauss's law is directly proportional to L. Let us write it as charge per unit length  times length L:

     Hence, Gauss's law for any cylindrically symmetrical charge distribution yields the following magnitude of the
     electric field a distance s away from the axis:

     The charge per unit length       depends on whether the field point is inside or outside the cylinder of charge

     distribution, just as we have seen for the spherical distribution.

Let R be the radius of the cylinder within which charges are distributed in a cylindrically symmetrical way. Let the

field point P be at a distance s from the axis. (The side of the Gaussian surface includes the field point P.) When

(that is, when P is outside the charge distribution), the Gaussian surface includes all the charge in the cylinder

of radius R and length L. When   (P is located inside the charge distribution), then only the charge within a

cylinder of radius s and length L is enclosed by the Gaussian surface:

Solution

a. Electric field at a point outside the shell. For a point outside the cylindrical shell, the Gaussian surface is the

surface of a cylinder of radius  and length L, as shown in Figure 6.30. The charge enclosed by the

Gaussian cylinder is equal to the charge on the cylindrical shell of length L. Therefore,                      is given by

where is a unit vector, perpendicular to the axis and pointing away from it, as shown in the figure. The

electric field at P points in the direction of given in Figure 6.30 if  and in the opposite direction to if

b. Electric field at a point inside the shell. For a point inside the cylindrical shell, the Gaussian surface is a

cylinder whose radius r is less than R (Figure 6.31). This means no charges are included inside the Gaussian

surface:

     the shell of charges.

     This gives us

     Significance

     Charge Distribution with Planar Symmetry

     A planar symmetry of charge density is obtained when charges are uniformly spread over a large flat surface. In
     planar symmetry, all points in a plane parallel to the plane of charge are identical with respect to the charges.

     Consequences of symmetry

     We take the plane of the charge distribution to be the xy-plane and we find the electric field at a space point P with

     coordinates (x, y, z). Since the charge density is the same at all (x, y)-coordinates in the  plane, by symmetry,

     the electric field at P cannot depend on the x- or y-coordinates of point P, as shown in Figure 6.32. Therefore, the

     electric field at P can only depend on the distance from the plane and has a direction either toward the plane or

     away from the plane. That is, the electric field at P has only a nonzero z-component.

     Uniform charges in xy plane:

     where z is the distance from the plane and is the unit vector normal to the plane. Note that in this system,

FIGURE 6.32 The components of the electric field parallel to a plane of charges cancel out the two charges located symmetrically from the
field point P. Therefore, the field at any point is pointed vertically from the plane of charges. For any point P and charge we can always
find a with this effect.

Gaussian surface and flux calculation
In the present case, a convenient Gaussian surface is a box, since the expected electric field points in one direction
only. To keep the Gaussian box symmetrical about the plane of charges, we take it to straddle the plane of the
charges, such that one face containing the field point P is taken parallel to the plane of the charges. In Figure 6.33,
sides I and II of the Gaussian surface (the box) that are parallel to the infinite plane have been shaded. They are the
only surfaces that give rise to nonzero flux because the electric field and the area vectors of the other faces are
perpendicular to each other.

FIGURE 6.33 A thin charged sheet and the Gaussian box for finding the electric field at the field point P. The normal to each face of the box
is from inside the box to outside. On two faces of the box, the electric fields are parallel to the area vectors, and on the other four faces, the
electric fields are perpendicular to the area vectors.

Let A be the area of the shaded surface on each side of the plane and be the magnitude of the electric field at
point P. Since sides I and II are at the same distance from the plane, the electric field has the same magnitude at
points in these planes, although the directions of the electric field at these points in the two planes are opposite to
each other.

Magnitude at I or II:

If the charge on the plane is positive, then the direction of the electric field and the area vectors are as shown in
Figure 6.33. Therefore, we find for the flux of electric field through the box

                                                                                                                                                     6.11

where the zeros are for the flux through the other sides of the box. Note that if the charge on the plane is negative,

the directions of electric field and area vectors for planes I and II are opposite to each other, and we get a negative

sign for the flux. According to Gauss's law, the flux must equal  . From Figure 6.33, we see that the charges

inside the volume enclosed by the Gaussian box reside on an area A of the xy-plane. Hence,

                                                                                            6.12

Using the equations for the flux and enclosed charge in Gauss's law, we can immediately determine the electric field
at a point at height z from a uniformly charged plane in the xy-plane:
246  6 · Gauss's Law

     The direction of the field depends on the sign of the charge on the plane and the side of the plane where the field

     point P is located. Note that above the plane,  , while below the plane,  .

     You may be surprised to note that the electric field does not actually depend on the distance from the plane; this is
     an effect of the assumption that the plane is infinite. In practical terms, the result given above is still a useful
     approximation for finite planes near the center.

     If an electric field is present inside a conductor, it exerts forces on the free electrons (also called conduction
     electrons), which are electrons in the material that are not bound to an atom. These free electrons then accelerate.
     However, moving charges by definition means nonstatic conditions, contrary to our assumption. Therefore, when
     electrostatic equilibrium is reached, the charge is distributed in such a way that the electric field inside the
     conductor vanishes.

     If you place a piece of a metal near a positive charge, the free electrons in the metal are attracted to the external
     positive charge and migrate freely toward that region. The region the electrons move to then has an excess of
     electrons over the protons in the atoms and the region from where the electrons have migrated has more protons
     than electrons. Consequently, the metal develops a negative region near the charge and a positive region at the far
     end (Figure 6.34). As we saw in the preceding chapter, this separation of equal magnitude and opposite type of
     electric charge is called polarization. If you remove the external charge, the electrons migrate back and neutralize
     the positive region.

     FIGURE 6.34 Polarization of a metallic sphere by an external point charge . The near side of the metal has an opposite surface charge
     compared to the far side of the metal. The sphere is said to be polarized. When you remove the external charge, the polarization of the
     metal also disappears.

     The polarization of the metal happens only in the presence of external charges. You can think of this in terms of

     electric fields. The external charge creates an external electric field. When the metal is placed in the region of this

     electric field, the electrons and protons of the metal experience electric forces due to this external electric field, but

     only the conduction electrons are free to move in the metal over macroscopic distances. The movement of the

     conduction electrons leads to the polarization, which creates an induced electric field in addition to the external

     electric field (Figure 6.35). The net electric field is a vector sum of the fields of and the surface charge densities

     and              This means that the net field inside the conductor is different from the field outside the conductor.

FIGURE 6.35 In the presence of an external charge q, the charges in a metal redistribute. The electric field at any point has three

contributions, from and the induced charges  and      Note that the surface charge distribution will not be uniform in this case.

The redistribution of charges is such that the sum of the three contributions at any point P inside the conductor is

Now, thanks to Gauss's law, we know that there is no net charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface that is solely within

the volume of the conductor at equilibrium. That is,  and hence

                                                                                                                                     6.13

Charge on a Conductor

An interesting property of a conductor in static equilibrium is that extra charges on the conductor end up on the
outer surface of the conductor, regardless of where they originate. Figure 6.36 illustrates a system in which we bring
an external positive charge inside the cavity of a metal and then touch it to the inside surface. Initially, the inside
surface of the cavity is negatively charged and the outside surface of the conductor is positively charged. When we
touch the inside surface of the cavity, the induced charge is neutralized, leaving the outside surface and the whole
metal charged with a net positive charge.

FIGURE 6.36 Electric charges on a conductor migrate to the outside surface no matter where you put them initially.

To see why this happens, note that the Gaussian surface in Figure 6.37 (the dashed line) follows the contour of the

actual surface of the conductor and is located an infinitesimal distance within it. Since  everywhere inside a

conductor,

Thus, from Gauss's law, there is no net charge inside the Gaussian surface. But the Gaussian surface lies just below
the actual surface of the conductor; consequently, there is no net charge inside the conductor. Any excess charge
must lie on its surface.
248  6 · Gauss's Law

                FIGURE 6.37 The dashed line represents a Gaussian surface that is just beneath the actual surface of the conductor.

     This particular property of conductors is the basis for an extremely accurate method developed by Plimpton and
     Lawton in 1936 to verify Gauss's law and, correspondingly, Coulomb's law. A sketch of their apparatus is shown in
     Figure 6.38. Two spherical shells are connected to one another through an electrometer E, a device that can detect
     a very slight amount of charge flowing from one shell to the other. When switch S is thrown to the left, charge is
     placed on the outer shell by the battery B. Will charge flow through the electrometer to the inner shell?

     No. Doing so would mean a violation of Gauss's law. Plimpton and Lawton did not detect any flow and, knowing the

     sensitivity of their electrometer, concluded that if the radial dependence in Coulomb's law were  , would be

     less than        1 . More recent measurements place at less than  2 , a number so small that the

     validity of Coulomb's law seems indisputable.

     the electrometer E.

     The Electric Field at the Surface of a Conductor

     If the electric field had a component parallel to the surface of a conductor, free charges on the surface would move,
     a situation contrary to the assumption of electrostatic equilibrium. Therefore, the electric field is always
     perpendicular to the surface of a conductor.

At any point just above the surface of a conductor, the surface charge density and the magnitude of the electric
field E are related by

To see this, consider an infinitesimally small Gaussian cylinder that surrounds a point on the surface of the

conductor, as in Figure 6.39. The cylinder has one end face inside and one end face outside the surface. The height

and cross-sectional area of the cylinder are and , respectively. The cylinder's sides are perpendicular to the

surface of the conductor, and its end faces are parallel to the surface. Because the cylinder is infinitesimally small,

the charge density is essentially constant over the surface enclosed, so the total charge inside the Gaussian

cylinder is  . Now E is perpendicular to the surface of the conductor outside the conductor and vanishes within

it, because otherwise, the charges would accelerate, and we would not be in equilibrium. Electric flux therefore

crosses only the outer end face of the Gaussian surface and may be written as  , since the cylinder is assumed

to be small enough that E is approximately constant over that area. From Gauss' law,

Thus,

perpendicular to the surface of the conductor outside the conductor and vanishes within it.

     Solution

     The flux calculation is similar to that for an infinite sheet of charge from the previous chapter with one major

     exception: The left face of the Gaussian surface is inside the conductor where        so the total flux through the

     Strategy

     The sphere is isolated, so its surface change distribution and the electric field of that distribution are spherically

     symmetrical. We can therefore represent the field as          . To calculate E(r), we apply Gauss's law over a

     closed spherical surface S of radius r that is concentric with the conducting sphere.

     Solution                         on the sphere,

     The electric field of the sphere may therefore be written as

     Significance

     Notice that in the region        , the electric field due to a charge q placed on an isolated conducting sphere of radius

     R is identical to the electric field of a point charge q located at the center of the sphere. The difference between the

     charged metal and a point charge occurs only at the space points inside the conductor. For a point charge placed at

     the center of the sphere, the electric field is not zero at points of space occupied by the sphere, but a conductor with

     the same amount of charge has a zero electric field at those points (Figure 6.43). However, there is no distinction at

     the outside points in space where          , and we can replace the isolated charged spherical conductor by a point

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 6.6

How will the system above change if there are charged objects external to the sphere?

For a conductor with a cavity, if we put a charge inside the cavity, then the charge separation takes place in the
conductor, with amount of charge on the inside surface and a amount of charge at the outside surface (Figure
6.44(a)). For the same conductor with a charge outside it, there is no excess charge on the inside surface; both
the positive and negative induced charges reside on the outside surface (Figure 6.44(b)).

FIGURE 6.44 (a) A charge inside a cavity in a metal. The distribution of charges at the outer surface does not depend on how the charges
are distributed at the inner surface, since the E-field inside the body of the metal is zero. That magnitude of the charge on the outer surface
does depend on the magnitude of the charge inside, however. (b) A charge outside a conductor containing an inner cavity. The cavity
remains free of charge. The polarization of charges on the conductor happens at the surface.

If a conductor has two cavities, one of them having a charge inside it and the other a charge             the

polarization of the conductor results in on the inside surface of the cavity a, on the inside surface of the

cavity b, and  on the outside surface (Figure 6.45). The charges on the surfaces may not be uniformly spread

out; their spread depends upon the geometry. The only rule obeyed is that when the equilibrium has been reached,

the charge distribution in a conductor is such that the electric field by the charge distribution in the conductor

cancels the electric field of the external charges at all space points inside the body of the conductor.

INTRODUCTION In Electric Charges and Fields, we just scratched the surface (or at least rubbed it) of electrical
phenomena. Two terms commonly used to describe electricity are its energy and voltage, which we show in this
chapter is directly related to the potential energy in a system.
We know, for example, that great amounts of electrical energy can be stored in batteries, are transmitted cross-
country via currents through power lines, and may jump from clouds to explode the sap of trees. In a similar
manner, at the molecular level, ions cross cell membranes and transfer information.
We also know about voltages associated with electricity. Batteries are typically a few volts, the outlets in your home
frequently produce 120 volts, and power lines can be as high as hundreds of thousands of volts. But energy and
voltage are not the same thing. A motorcycle battery, for example, is small and would not be very successful in
replacing a much larger car battery, yet each has the same voltage. In this chapter, we examine the relationship
between voltage and electrical energy, and begin to explore some of the many applications of electricity.

     7.1 Electric Potential Energy

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define the work done by an electric force
         · Define electric potential energy
         · Apply work and potential energy in systems with electric charges

     When a free positive charge q is accelerated by an electric field, it is given kinetic energy (Figure 7.2). The process is
     analogous to an object being accelerated by a gravitational field, as if the charge were going down an electrical hill
     where its electric potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, although of course the sources of the forces are
     very different. Let us explore the work done on a charge q by the electric field in this process, so that we may
     develop a definition of electric potential energy.

     FIGURE 7.2 A charge accelerated by an electric field is analogous to a mass going down a hill. In both cases, potential energy decreases as

     kinetic energy increases,        . Work is done by a force, but since this force is conservative, we can write  .

     The electrostatic or Coulomb force is conservative, which means that the work done on q is independent of the path
     taken, as we will demonstrate later. This is exactly analogous to the gravitational force. When a force is conservative,
     it is possible to define a potential energy associated with the force. It is usually easier to work with the potential
     energy (because it depends only on position) than to calculate the work directly.

     To show this explicitly, consider an electric charge fixed at the origin and move another charge toward q in
     such a manner that, at each instant, the applied force exactly balances the electric force on Q (Figure 7.3).
     The work done by the applied force on the charge Q changes the potential energy of Q. We call this potential
     energy the electrical potential energy of Q.

     The work            FIGURE 7.3 Displacement of "test" charge Q in the presence of fixed "source" charge q.

               done by the applied force when the particle moves from to may be calculated by

     Since the applied force balances the electric force  on Q, the two forces have equal magnitude and opposite
     directions. Therefore, the applied force is

where we have defined positive to be pointing away from the origin and r is the distance from the origin. The
directions of both the displacement and the applied force in the system in Figure 7.3 are parallel, and thus the work
done on the system is positive.

We use the letter U to denote electric potential energy, which has units of joules (J). When a conservative force does

negative work, the system gains potential energy. When a conservative force does positive work, the system loses

potential energy,   In the system in Figure 7.3, the Coulomb force acts in the opposite direction to the

displacement; therefore, the work is negative. However, we have increased the potential energy in the two-charge

system.

   EXAMPLE 7.1

Kinetic Energy of a Charged Particle

A        charge Q is initially at rest a distance of 10 cm ( ) from a  charge q fixed at the origin (Figure

7.4). Naturally, the Coulomb force accelerates Q away from q, eventually reaching 15 cm ( ).

                   FIGURE 7.4 The charge Q is repelled by q, thus having work done on it and gaining kinetic energy.

   b. How much kinetic energy does Q have at ?

Strategy
Calculate the work with the usual definition. Since Q started from rest, this is the same as the kinetic energy.

Solution
Integrating force over distance, we obtain

This is also the value of the kinetic energy at

Significance
Charge Q was initially at rest; the electric field of q did work on Q, so now Q has kinetic energy equal to the work
done by the electric field.

In this example, the work W done to accelerate a positive charge from rest is positive and results from a loss in U, or
a negative . A value for U can be found at any point by taking one point as a reference and calculating the work

     Mathematically,
                                                                                                                                                      7.1

     Gravitational potential energy and electric potential energy are quite analogous. Potential energy accounts for work
     done by a conservative force and gives added insight regarding energy and energy transformation without the
     necessity of dealing with the force directly. It is much more common, for example, to use the concept of electric
     potential energy than to deal with the Coulomb force directly in real-world applications.

     In polar coordinates with q at the origin and Q located at r, the displacement element vector is           and thus
     the work becomes

     Notice that this result only depends on the endpoints and is otherwise independent of the path taken. To explore

     this further, compare path to with path             in Figure 7.5.

     FIGURE 7.5 Two paths for displacement to The work on segments                  and       are zero due to the electrical force being

     perpendicular to the displacement along these paths. Therefore, work on paths       and  are equal.

     The segments            and  are arcs of circles centered at q. Since the force on Q points either toward or away

     from q, no work is done by a force balancing the electric force, because it is perpendicular to the displacement along

     these arcs. Therefore, the only work done is along segment                     which is identical to

     One implication of this work calculation is that if we were to go around the path                     the net work would

     be zero (Figure 7.6). Recall that this is how we determine whether a force is conservative or not. Hence, because the

     electric force is related to the electric field by  , the electric field is itself conservative. That is,

     Note that Q is a constant.

                                           FIGURE 7.6 A closed path in an electric field. The net work around this path is zero.

     Another implication is that we may define an electric potential energy. Recall that the work done by a conservative
     force is also expressed as the difference in the potential energy corresponding to that force. Therefore, the work

            to bring a charge from a reference point to a point of interest may be written as

and, by Equation 7.1, the difference in potential energy         of the test charge Q between the two points is

Therefore, we can write a general expression for the potential energy of two point charges (in spherical coordinates):

We may take the second term to be an arbitrary constant reference level, which serves as the zero reference:

A convenient choice of reference that relies on our common sense is that when the two charges are infinitely far
apart, there is no interaction between them. (Recall the discussion of reference potential energy in Potential Energy
and Conservation of Energy (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/8-introduction).) Taking
the potential energy of this state to be zero removes the term from the equation (just like when we say the
ground is zero potential energy in a gravitational potential energy problem), and the potential energy of Q when it is
separated from q by a distance r assumes the form

                                                                          7.2

This formula is symmetrical with respect to q and Q, so it is best described as the potential energy of the two-charge
system.

A         charge Q is initially at rest a distance of 10 cm ( ) from a  charge q fixed at the origin (Figure

     The change in the potential energy is negative, as expected, and equal in magnitude to the change in kinetic energy
     in this system. Recall from Example 7.1 that the change in kinetic energy was positive.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 7.2                                                in the above example?

     What is the potential energy of Q relative to the zero reference at infinity at

     Due to Coulomb's law, the forces due to multiple charges on a test charge Q superimpose; they may be calculated
     individually and then added. This implies that the work integrals and hence the resulting potential energies exhibit
     the same behavior. To demonstrate this, we consider an example of assembling a system of four charges.

     EXAMPLE 7.3

     Assembling Four Positive Charges

     Find the amount of work an external agent must do in assembling four charges                            and

               at the vertices of a square of side 1.0 cm, starting each charge from infinity (Figure 7.8).

                                FIGURE 7.8 How much work is needed to assemble this charge configuration?

     Strategy
     We bring in the charges one at a time, giving them starting locations at infinity and calculating the work to bring
     them in from infinity to their final location. We do this in order of increasing charge.

     Solution

     Step 1. First bring the          charge to the origin. Since there are no other charges at a finite distance from this

     charge yet, no work is done in bringing it from infinity,

     Step 2. While keeping the        charge fixed at the origin, bring the           charge to

     (Figure 7.9). Now, the applied force must do work against the force exerted by the                    charge fixed at the

     origin. The work done equals the change in the potential energy of the           charge:

Step 3. While keeping the charges of  and  fixed in their places, bring in the                charge to

FIGURE 7.10 Step 3. The work to bring the     charge from infinity.

Step 4. Finally, while keeping the first three charges in their places, bring the  charge to
                                   (Figure 7.11). The work done here is

FIGURE 7.11 Step 4. The work to bring the     charge from infinity.

Hence, the total work done by the applied force in assembling the four charges is equal to the sum of the work in
bringing each charge from infinity to its final position:
274  7 · Electric Potential

     Significance

     The work on each charge depends only on its pairwise interactions with the other charges. No more complicated
     interactions need to be considered; the work on the third charge only depends on its interaction with the first and
     second charges, the interaction between the first and second charge does not affect the third.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 7.3

     Is the electrical potential energy of two point charges positive or negative if the charges are of the same sign?
     Opposite signs? How does this relate to the work necessary to bring the charges into proximity from infinity?

     Note that the electrical potential energy is positive if the two charges are of the same type, either positive or
     negative, and negative if the two charges are of opposite types. This makes sense if you think of the change in the
     potential energy as you bring the two charges closer or move them farther apart. Depending on the relative
     types of charges, you may have to work on the system or the system would do work on you, that is, your work is
     either positive or negative. If you have to do positive work on the system (actually push the charges closer), then the
     energy of the system should increase. If you bring two positive charges or two negative charges closer, you have to
     do positive work on the system, which raises their potential energy. Since potential energy is proportional to 1/r, the
     potential energy goes up when r goes down between two positive or two negative charges.

     On the other hand, if you bring a positive and a negative charge nearer, you have to do negative work on the system
     (the charges are pulling you), which means that you take energy away from the system. This reduces the potential
     energy. Since potential energy is negative in the case of a positive and a negative charge pair, the increase in 1/r
     makes the potential energy more negative, which is the same as a reduction in potential energy.

     The result from Example 7.3 may be extended to systems with any arbitrary number of charges. In this case, it is
     most convenient to write the formula as

                                                                                                                                                            7.3

     The factor of 1/2 accounts for adding each pair of charges twice.

     7.2 Electric Potential and Potential Difference

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define electric potential, voltage, and potential difference
         · Define the electron-volt
         · Calculate electric potential and potential difference from potential energy and electric field
         · Describe systems in which the electron-volt is a useful unit
         · Apply conservation of energy to electric systems

     Recall that earlier we defined electric field to be a quantity independent of the test charge in a given system, which
     would nonetheless allow us to calculate the force that would result on an arbitrary test charge. (The default
     assumption in the absence of other information is that the test charge is positive.) We briefly defined a field for
     gravity, but gravity is always attractive, whereas the electric force can be either attractive or repulsive. Therefore,
     although potential energy is perfectly adequate in a gravitational system, it is convenient to define a quantity that
     allows us to calculate the work on a charge independent of the magnitude of the charge. Calculating the work

     directly may be difficult, since  and the direction and magnitude of can be complex for multiple

     charges, for odd-shaped objects, and along arbitrary paths. But we do know that because               , the work, and

     hence    is proportional to the test charge q. To have a physical quantity that is independent of test charge, we

     define electric potential V (or simply potential, since electric is understood) to be the potential energy per unit

     charge:

ELECTRIC POTENTIAL

The electric potential energy per unit charge is
                                                                                                                                                 7.4

Since U is proportional to q, the dependence on q cancels. Thus, V does not depend on q. The change in potential
energy is crucial, so we are concerned with the difference in potential or potential difference between two
points, where

ELECTRIC POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE

The electric potential difference between points A and B,  is defined to be the change in potential

energy of a charge q moved from A to B, divided by the charge. Units of potential difference are joules per

coulomb, given the name volt (V) after Alessandro Volta.

The familiar term voltage is the common name for electric potential difference. Keep in mind that whenever a
voltage is quoted, it is understood to be the potential difference between two points. For example, every battery has
two terminals, and its voltage is the potential difference between them. More fundamentally, the point you choose
to be zero volts is arbitrary. This is analogous to the fact that gravitational potential energy has an arbitrary zero,
such as sea level or perhaps a lecture hall floor. It is worthwhile to emphasize the distinction between potential
difference and electrical potential energy.

  POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE AND ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL ENERGY

  The relationship between potential difference (or voltage) and electrical potential energy is given by

                                                                                                                                                    7.5

Voltage is not the same as energy. Voltage is the energy per unit charge. Thus, a motorcycle battery and a car battery

can both have the same voltage (more precisely, the same potential difference between battery terminals), yet one

stores much more energy than the other because             The car battery can move more charge than the

motorcycle battery, although both are 12-V batteries.

EXAMPLE 7.4

Calculating Energy

You have a 12.0-V motorcycle battery that can move 5000 C of charge, and a 12.0-V car battery that can move
60,000 C of charge. How much energy does each deliver? (Assume that the numerical value of each charge is
accurate to three significant figures.)

Strategy

To say we have a 12.0-V battery means that its terminals have a 12.0-V potential difference. When such a battery

moves charge, it puts the charge through a potential difference of 12.0 V, and the charge is given a change in

potential energy equal to  To find the energy output, we multiply the charge moved by the potential

difference.

     Significance

     Voltage and energy are related, but they are not the same thing. The voltages of the batteries are identical, but the
     energy supplied by each is quite different. A car battery has a much larger engine to start than a motorcycle. Note
     also that as a battery is discharged, some of its energy is used internally and its terminal voltage drops, such as
     when headlights dim because of a depleted car battery. The energy supplied by the battery is still calculated as in
     this example, but not all of the energy is available for external use.

     How much energy does a 1.5-V AAA battery have that can move 100 C?

     Note that the energies calculated in the previous example are absolute values. The change in potential energy for

     the battery is negative, since it loses energy. These batteries, like many electrical systems, actually move negative

     charge--electrons in particular. The batteries repel electrons from their negative terminals (A) through whatever

     circuitry is involved and attract them to their positive terminals (B), as shown in Figure 7.12. The change in potential

     is                               and the charge q is negative, so that  is negative, meaning the potential

     energy of the battery has decreased when q has moved from A to B.

     FIGURE 7.12 A battery moves negative charge from its negative terminal through a headlight to its positive terminal. Appropriate
     combinations of chemicals in the battery separate charges so that the negative terminal has an excess of negative charge, which is repelled
     by it and attracted to the excess positive charge on the other terminal. In terms of potential, the positive terminal is at a higher voltage than
     the negative terminal. Inside the battery, both positive and negative charges move.

Significance
This is a very large number. It is no wonder that we do not ordinarily observe individual electrons with so many being
present in ordinary systems. In fact, electricity had been in use for many decades before it was determined that the
moving charges in many circumstances were negative. Positive charge moving in the opposite direction of negative
charge often produces identical effects; this makes it difficult to determine which is moving or whether both are
moving.

How many electrons would go through a 24.0-W lamp each second from a 12-volt car battery?

The Electron-Volt

The energy per electron is very small in macroscopic situations like that in the previous example--a tiny fraction of a
joule. But on a submicroscopic scale, such energy per particle (electron, proton, or ion) can be of great importance.
For example, even a tiny fraction of a joule can be great enough for these particles to destroy organic molecules and
harm living tissue. The particle may do its damage by direct collision, or it may create harmful X-rays, which can also
inflict damage. It is useful to have an energy unit related to submicroscopic effects.

Figure 7.13 shows a situation related to the definition of such an energy unit. An electron is accelerated between
two charged metal plates, as it might be in an old-model television tube or oscilloscope. The electron gains kinetic
energy that is later converted into another form--light in the television tube, for example. (Note that in terms of
energy, "downhill" for the electron is "uphill" for a positive charge.) Since energy is related to voltage by

                , we can think of the joule as a coulomb-volt.

     volts is numerically the same as the voltage between the plates. For example, a 5000-V potential difference produces 5000-eV electrons.

     The conceptual construct, namely two parallel plates with a hole in one, is shown in (a), while a real electron gun is shown in (b).

     ELECTRON-VOLT

     On the submicroscopic scale, it is more convenient to define an energy unit called the electron-volt (eV), which
     is the energy given to a fundamental charge accelerated through a potential difference of 1 V. In equation form,

     An electron accelerated through a potential difference of 1 V is given an energy of 1 eV. It follows that an electron
     accelerated through 50 V gains 50 eV. A potential difference of 100,000 V (100 kV) gives an electron an energy of
     100,000 eV (100 keV), and so on. Similarly, an ion with a double positive charge accelerated through 100 V gains
     200 eV of energy. These simple relationships between accelerating voltage and particle charges make the electron-
     volt a simple and convenient energy unit in such circumstances.

     The electron-volt is commonly employed in submicroscopic processes--chemical valence energies and molecular

     and nuclear binding energies are among the quantities often expressed in electron-volts. For example, about 5 eV of

     energy is required to break up certain organic molecules. If a proton is accelerated from rest through a potential

     difference of 30 kV, it acquires an energy of 30 keV (30,000 eV) and can break up as many as 6000 of these

     molecules                        Nuclear decay energies are on the order of 1 MeV

     (1,000,000 eV) per event and can thus produce significant biological damage.

     Conservation of Energy

     The total energy of a system is conserved if there is no net addition (or subtraction) due to work or heat transfer. For
     conservative forces, such as the electrostatic force, conservation of energy states that mechanical energy is a
     constant.

Mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy of a system; that is,  A

loss of U for a charged particle becomes an increase in its K. Conservation of energy is stated in equation form as

or

where i and f stand for initial and final conditions. As we have found many times before, considering energy can give
us insights and facilitate problem solving.

Electrical Potential Energy Converted into Kinetic Energy

Calculate the final speed of a free electron accelerated from rest through a potential difference of 100 V. (Assume
that this numerical value is accurate to three significant figures.)

Strategy
We have a system with only conservative forces. Assuming the electron is accelerated in a vacuum, and neglecting
the gravitational force (we will check on this assumption later), all of the electrical potential energy is converted into
kinetic energy. We can identify the initial and final forms of energy to be

Solution
Conservation of energy states that

Entering the forms identified above, we obtain

We solve this for v:

Entering values for q, V, and m gives

Significance
Note that both the charge and the initial voltage are negative, as in Figure 7.13. From the discussion of electric
charge and electric field, we know that electrostatic forces on small particles are generally very large compared with
the gravitational force. The large final speed confirms that the gravitational force is indeed negligible here. The large
speed also indicates how easy it is to accelerate electrons with small voltages because of their very small mass.
Voltages much higher than the 100 V in this problem are typically used in electron guns. These higher voltages
produce electron speeds so great that effects from special relativity must be taken into account and hence are
reserved for a later chapter (Relativity (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/
5-introduction)). That is why we consider a low voltage (accurately) in this example.

     Voltage and Electric Field

     So far, we have explored the relationship between voltage and energy. Now we want to explore the relationship
     between voltage and electric field. We will start with the general case for a non-uniform field. Recall that our
     general formula for the potential energy of a test charge q at point P relative to reference point R is

     When we substitute in the definition of electric field    this becomes

     Applying our definition of potential  to this potential energy, we find that, in general,

                                                                                                                        7.6

     From our previous discussion of the potential energy of a charge in an electric field, the result is independent of the
     path chosen, and hence we can pick the integral path that is most convenient.

     Consider the special case of a positive point charge q at the origin. To calculate the potential caused by q at a

     distance r from the origin relative to a reference of 0 at infinity (recall that we did the same for potential energy), let

     and  with                             and use             When we evaluate the integral

     for this system, we have                                
     which simplifies to

     is the standard form of the potential of a point charge. This will be explored further in the next section.

     To examine another interesting special case, suppose a uniform electric field is produced by placing a potential
     difference (or voltage) across two parallel metal plates, labeled A and B (Figure 7.14). Examining this situation
     will tell us what voltage is needed to produce a certain electric field strength. It will also reveal a more fundamental
     relationship between electric potential and electric field.

From a physicist's point of view, either or can be used to describe any interaction between charges. However,

(Note that the magnitude of the electric field, a scalar quantity, is represented by E.) The relationship between
and is revealed by calculating the work done by the electric force in moving a charge from point A to point B. But,
as noted earlier, arbitrary charge distributions require calculus. We therefore look at a uniform electric field as an
interesting special case.

The work done by the electric field in Figure 7.14 to move a positive charge q from A, the positive plate, higher
potential, to B, the negative plate, lower potential, is

Work is                   ; here  , since the path is parallel to the field. Thus,  . Since
           , we see that  .

Substituting this expression for work into the previous equation gives

The charge cancels, so we obtain for the voltage between points A and B

where d is the distance from A to B, or the distance between the plates in Figure 7.14. Note that this equation
implies that the units for electric field are volts per meter. We already know the units for electric field are newtons
per coulomb; thus, the following relation among units is valid:

Furthermore, we may extend this to the integral form. Substituting Equation 7.6 into our definition for the potential
difference between points A and B, we obtain
282  7 · Electric Potential

     which simplifies to

     The potential difference is negative (V is lower at B than at A) when the displacement is in the same direction as the

     field. In other words, the electric field points toward lower electric potential. We are often only interested in the

     magnitude of the electric field, in which case you may see      instead of  and it is understood

     that all of the variables in the equation represent the magnitudes of the quantities. As a demonstration, from this we

     may calculate the potential difference between two points (A and B) equidistant from a point charge q at the origin,

     as shown in Figure 7.15.

     FIGURE 7.15 The arc for calculating the potential difference between two points that are equidistant from a point charge at the origin.

     To do this, we integrate around an arc of the circle of constant radius r between A and B, which means we let

               while using                  . Thus,

                                                                                                                            7.7

     However,                and therefore

     This result, that there is no difference in potential along a constant radius from a point charge, will come in handy
     when we map potentials.

     EXAMPLE 7.7

     What Is the Highest Voltage Possible between Two Plates?

     Dry air can support a maximum electric field strength of about              Above that value, the field creates

     enough ionization in the air to make the air a conductor. This allows a discharge or spark that reduces the field.

     What, then, is the maximum voltage between two parallel conducting plates separated by 2.5 cm of dry air?

     Strategy

     We are given the maximum electric field E between the plates and the distance d between them. We can use the

     equation                (recall that these represent absolute values) to calculate the maximum voltage.

Entering the given values for E and d gives

or

(The answer is quoted to only two digits, since the maximum field strength is approximate.)
Significance
One of the implications of this result is that it takes about 75 kV to make a spark jump across a 2.5-cm (1-in.) gap, or
150 kV for a 5-cm spark. This limits the voltages that can exist between conductors, perhaps on a power
transmission line. A smaller voltage can cause a spark if there are spines on the surface, since sharp points have
larger field strengths than smooth surfaces. Humid air breaks down at a lower field strength, meaning that a smaller
voltage will make a spark jump through humid air. The largest voltages can be built up with static electricity on dry
days (Figure 7.16).

FIGURE 7.16 A spark chamber is used to trace the paths of high-energy particles. Ionization created by the particles as they pass through
the gas between the plates allows a spark to jump. The sparks are perpendicular to the plates, following electric field lines between them.
The potential difference between adjacent plates is not high enough to cause sparks without the ionization produced by particles from
accelerator experiments (or cosmic rays). This form of detector is now archaic and no longer in use except for demonstration purposes.

Field and Force inside an Electron Gun

An electron gun (Figure 7.13) has parallel plates separated by 4.00 cm and gives electrons 25.0 keV of energy. (a)

What is the electric field strength between the plates? (b) What force would this field exert on a piece of plastic with

a           charge that gets between the plates?

Strategy

Since the voltage and plate separation are given, the electric field strength can be calculated directly from the

expression  . Once we know the electric field strength, we can find the force on a charge by using

Since the electric field is in only one direction, we can write this equation in terms of the magnitudes,  .

Solution

   a. The expression for the magnitude of the electric field between two uniform metal plates is

   Since the electron is a single charge and is given 25.0 keV of energy, the potential difference must be 25.0 kV.

        PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Electrostatics

  1. Examine the situation to determine if static electricity is involved; this may concern separated stationary
        charges, the forces among them, and the electric fields they create.

  2. Identify the system of interest. This includes noting the number, locations, and types of charges involved.
  3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful.

        Determine whether the Coulomb force is to be considered directly--if so, it may be useful to draw a free-body
        diagram, using electric field lines.
  4. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). It is important
       to distinguish the Coulomb force F from the electric field E, for example.
  5. Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown) or draw the field lines as
        requested.
  6. Examine the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? Are units correct and the numbers involved
        reasonable?

7.3 Calculations of Electric Potential

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Calculate the potential due to a point charge
    · Calculate the potential of a system of multiple point charges
    · Describe an electric dipole
    · Define dipole moment
    · Calculate the potential of a continuous charge distribution

Point charges, such as electrons, are among the fundamental building blocks of matter. Furthermore, spherical
charge distributions (such as charge on a metal sphere) create external electric fields exactly like a point charge. The
electric potential due to a point charge is, thus, a case we need to consider.

We can use calculus to find the work needed to move a test charge q from a large distance away to a distance of r

from a point charge q. Noting the connection between work and potential  as in the last section, we

can obtain the following result.

ELECTRIC POTENTIAL V OF A POINT CHARGE

The electric potential V of a point charge is given by
                                                                                                                                                 7.8

where k is a constant equal to
286  7 · Electric Potential

     The potential at infinity is chosen to be zero. Thus, V for a point charge decreases with distance, whereas  for a
     point charge decreases with distance squared:

     Recall that the electric potential difference V is a scalar and has no direction, whereas the electric field is a
     vector. To find the voltage due to a combination of point charges, given zero voltage at infinitely far away, you add
     the individual voltages as numbers. We will assume for the rest of this chapter that there is zero voltage measured
     infinitely far away. To find the total electric field, you must add the individual fields as vectors, taking magnitude and

     direction into account. This is consistent with the fact that V is closely associated with energy, a scalar, whereas
     is closely associated with force, a vector.

     What Voltage Is Produced by a Small Charge on a Metal Sphere?

     Charges in static electricity are typically in the nanocoulomb (nC) to microcoulomb       range. What is the voltage

     5.00 cm away from the center of a 1-cm-diameter solid metal sphere that has a -3.00-nC static charge?

     Strategy
     As we discussed in Electric Charges and Fields, charge on a metal sphere spreads out uniformly and produces a field
     like that of a point charge located at its center. Thus, we can find the voltage using the equation

     Solution
     Entering known values into the expression for the potential of a point charge, we obtain

     Significance
     The negative value for voltage means a positive charge would be attracted from a larger distance, since the potential
     is lower (more negative) than at larger distances. Conversely, a negative charge would be repelled, as expected.

The potential on the surface is the same as that of a point charge at the center of the sphere, 12.5 cm away. (The
radius of the sphere is 12.5 cm.) We can thus determine the excess charge using the equation

Solution
Solving for q and entering known values gives

Significance
This is a relatively small charge, but it produces a rather large voltage. We have another indication here that it is
difficult to store isolated charges.

What is the potential inside the metal sphere in Example 7.10?

The voltages in both of these examples could be measured with a meter that compares the measured potential with

ground potential. Ground potential is often taken to be zero (instead of taking the potential at infinity to be zero). It

is the potential difference between two points that is of importance, and very often there is a tacit assumption that

some reference point, such as Earth or a very distant point, is at zero potential. As noted earlier, this is analogous to

taking sea level as  when considering gravitational potential energy  .

Systems of Multiple Point Charges

Just as the electric field obeys a superposition principle, so does the electric potential. Consider a system consisting
288  7 · Electric Potential

     of N charges                     What is the net electric potential V at a space point P from these charges? Each of these

     charges is a source charge that produces its own electric potential at point P, independent of whatever other

     changes may be doing. Let        be the electric potentials at P produced by the charges

     respectively. Then, the net electric potential at that point is equal to the sum of these individual electric

     potentials. You can easily show this by calculating the potential energy of a test charge when you bring the test

     charge from the reference point at infinity to point P:

     Note that electric potential follows the same principle of superposition as electric field and electric potential energy.

     To show this more explicitly, note that a test charge at the point P in space has distances of                 from

     the N charges fixed in space above, as shown in Figure 7.19. Using our formula for the potential of a point charge for

     each of these (assumed to be point) charges, we find that

                                                                                                                              7.9

     Therefore, the electric potential energy of the test charge is

     which is the same as the work to bring the test charge into the system, as found in the first section of the chapter.

     The Electric Dipole

     An electric dipole is a system of two equal but opposite charges a fixed distance apart. This system is used to
     model many real-world systems, including atomic and molecular interactions. One of these systems is the water
     molecule, under certain circumstances. These circumstances are met inside a microwave oven, where electric fields
     with alternating directions make the water molecules change orientation. This vibration is the same as heat at the

What is the potential on the x-axis? The z-axis?

Now let us consider the special case when the distance of the point P from the dipole is much greater than the

distance between the charges in the dipole,  for example, when we are interested in the electric potential due

to a polarized molecule such as a water molecule. This is not so far (infinity) that we can simply treat the potential as

zero, but the distance is great enough that we can simplify our calculations relative to the previous example.

We start by noting that in Figure 7.21 the potential is given by

     coordinates, with                and      . This gives us

     We can simplify this expression by pulling r out of the root,

     and then multiplying out the parentheses

Potential of Continuous Charge Distributions

We have been working with point charges a great deal, but what about continuous charge distributions? Recall from
Equation 7.9 that

We may treat a continuous charge distribution as a collection of infinitesimally separated individual points. This
yields the integral

                                                                                                                                                     7.12

     To set up the problem, we choose Cartesian coordinates in such a way as to exploit the symmetry in the problem as

     much as possible. We place the origin at the center of the wire and orient the y-axis along the wire so that the ends

     of the wire are at      . The field point P is in the xy-plane and since the choice of axes is up to us, we choose

     the x-axis to pass through the field point P, as shown in Figure 7.23.

     Significance
     Note that this was simpler than the equivalent problem for electric field, due to the use of scalar quantities. Recall
     that we expect the zero level of the potential to be at infinity, when we have a finite charge. To examine this, we take
     the limit of the above potential as x approaches infinity; in this case, the terms inside the natural log approach one,
     and hence the potential approaches zero in this limit. Note that we could have done this problem equivalently in
     cylindrical coordinates; the only effect would be to substitute r for x and z for y.

     Strategy

     Significance

     The basic procedure for a disk is to first integrate around and then over r. This has been demonstrated for uniform

However, this limit does not exist because the argument of the logarithm becomes [2/0] as                          , so this way of

finding V of an infinite wire does not work. The reason for this problem may be traced to the fact that the charges are
not localized in some space but continue to infinity in the direction of the wire. Hence, our (unspoken) assumption
that zero potential must be an infinite distance from the wire is no longer valid.

To avoid this difficulty in calculating limits, let us use the definition of potential by integrating over the electric field
from the previous section, and the value of the electric field from this charge configuration from the previous
chapter.

Solution
We use the integral

where R is a finite distance from the line of charge, as shown in Figure 7.26.

Now, if we define the reference potential  at             this simplifies to

Note that this form of the potential is quite usable; it is 0 at 1 m and is undefined at infinity, which is why we could
not use the latter as a reference.

Significance
Although calculating potential directly can be quite convenient, we just found a system for which this strategy does
not work well. In such cases, going back to the definition of potential in terms of the electric field may offer a way
forward.

     7.4 Determining Field from Potential

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how to calculate the electric field in a system from the given potential
         · Calculate the electric field in a given direction from a given potential
         · Calculate the electric field throughout space from a given potential

     Recall that we were able, in certain systems, to calculate the potential by integrating over the electric field. As you
     may already suspect, this means that we may calculate the electric field by taking derivatives of the potential,
     although going from a scalar to a vector quantity introduces some interesting wrinkles. We frequently need to
     calculate the force in a system; since it is often simpler to calculate the potential directly, there are systems in which
     it is useful to calculate V and then derive from it.

     In general, regardless of whether the electric field is uniform, it points in the direction of decreasing potential,
     because the force on a positive charge is in the direction of and also in the direction of lower potential V.
     Furthermore, the magnitude of equals the rate of decrease of V with distance. The faster V decreases over
     distance, the greater the electric field. This gives us the following result.

       RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VOLTAGE AND UNIFORM ELECTRIC FIELD

       In equation form, the relationship between voltage and uniform electric field is

       where is the distance over which the change in potential takes place. The minus sign tells us that E
       points in the direction of decreasing potential. The electric field is said to be the gradient (as in grade or slope) of
       the electric potential.

     For continually changing potentials, and become infinitesimals, and we need differential calculus to
     determine the electric field. As shown in Figure 7.27, if we treat the distance as very small so that the electric
     field is essentially constant over it, we find that

     FIGURE 7.27 The electric field component, , along the displacement  is given by    . Note that A and B are assumed to be so
     close together that the field is constant along .

7.5 Equipotential Surfaces and Conductors

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define equipotential surfaces and equipotential lines
    · Explain the relationship between equipotential lines and electric field lines
    · Map equipotential lines for one or two point charges
    · Describe the potential of a conductor
    · Compare and contrast equipotential lines and elevation lines on topographic maps

We can represent electric potentials (voltages) pictorially, just as we drew pictures to illustrate electric fields. This is

not surprising, since the two concepts are related. Consider Figure 7.30, which shows an isolated positive point

charge and its electric field lines, which radiate out from a positive charge and terminate on negative charges. We

use red arrows to represent the magnitude and direction of the electric field, and we use black lines to represent

places where the electric potential is constant. These are called equipotential surfaces in three dimensions, or

equipotential lines in two dimensions. The term equipotential is also used as a noun, referring to an equipotential

line or surface. The potential for a point charge is the same anywhere on an imaginary sphere of radius r surrounding

the charge. This is true because the potential for a point charge is given by       and thus has the same value at

any point that is a given distance r from the charge. An equipotential sphere is a circle in the two-dimensional view

of Figure 7.30. Because the electric field lines point radially away from the charge, they are perpendicular to the

equipotential lines.

FIGURE 7.30 An isolated point charge Q with its electric field lines in red and equipotential lines in black. The potential is the same along
each equipotential line, meaning that no work is required to move a charge anywhere along one of those lines. Work is needed to move a
charge from one equipotential line to another. Equipotential lines are perpendicular to electric field lines in every case. For a three-
dimensional version, explore the first interactive link.
300  7 · Electric Potential

     It is important to note that equipotential lines are always perpendicular to electric field lines. No work is required to

     move a charge along an equipotential, since  . Thus, the work is

     Work is zero if the direction of the force is perpendicular to the displacement. Force is in the same direction as E, so
     motion along an equipotential must be perpendicular to E. More precisely, work is related to the electric field by

     Note that in this equation, E and F symbolize the magnitudes of the electric field and force, respectively. Neither q

     nor E is zero; d is also not zero. So  must be 0, meaning must be . In other words, motion along an

     equipotential is perpendicular to E.

     One of the rules for static electric fields and conductors is that the electric field must be perpendicular to the
     surface of any conductor. This implies that a conductor is an equipotential surface in static situations. There can be
     no voltage difference across the surface of a conductor, or charges will flow. One of the uses of this fact is that a
     conductor can be fixed at what we consider zero volts by connecting it to the earth with a good conductor--a process
     called grounding. Grounding can be a useful safety tool. For example, grounding the metal case of an electrical
     appliance ensures that it is at zero volts relative to Earth.

     Because a conductor is an equipotential, it can replace any equipotential surface. For example, in Figure 7.30, a
     charged spherical conductor can replace the point charge, and the electric field and potential surfaces outside of it
     will be unchanged, confirming the contention that a spherical charge distribution is equivalent to a point charge at
     its center.

     Figure 7.31 shows the electric field and equipotential lines for two equal and opposite charges. Given the electric
     field lines, the equipotential lines can be drawn simply by making them perpendicular to the electric field lines.
     Conversely, given the equipotential lines, as in Figure 7.32(a), the electric field lines can be drawn by making them
     perpendicular to the equipotentials, as in Figure 7.32(b).

     FIGURE 7.31 The electric field lines and equipotential lines for two equal but opposite charges. The equipotential lines can be drawn by
     making them perpendicular to the electric field lines, if those are known. Note that the potential is greatest (most positive) near the positive
     charge and least (most negative) near the negative charge. For a three-dimensional version, explore the first interactive link.

To improve your intuition, we show a three-dimensional variant of the potential in a system with two opposing
charges. Figure 7.33 displays a three-dimensional map of electric potential, where lines on the map are for
equipotential surfaces. The hill is at the positive charge, and the trough is at the negative charge. The potential is
zero far away from the charges. Note that the cut off at a particular potential implies that the charges are on
conducting spheres with a finite radius.

FIGURE 7.33 Electric potential map of two opposite charges of equal magnitude on conducting spheres. The potential is negative near the
negative charge and positive near the positive charge.

A two-dimensional map of the cross-sectional plane that contains both charges is shown in Figure 7.34. The line
that is equidistant from the two opposite charges corresponds to zero potential, since at the points on the line, the
positive potential from the positive charge cancels the negative potential from the negative charge. Equipotential
lines in the cross-sectional plane are closed loops, which are not necessarily circles, since at each point, the net
potential is the sum of the potentials from each charge.

Calculating Equipotential Lines

You have seen the equipotential lines of a point charge in Figure 7.30. How do we calculate them? For example, if

Strategy
Set the equation for the potential of a point charge equal to a constant and solve for the remaining variable(s). Then
calculate values as needed.

Solution

In         , let V be a constant. The only remaining variable is r; hence,  . Thus, the

equipotential surfaces are spheres about the origin. Their locations are:

This means that equipotential surfaces around a point charge are spheres of constant radius, as shown earlier, with
well-defined locations.

What are the equipotential surfaces for an infinite line charge?

Distribution of Charges on Conductors

In Example 7.19 with a point charge, we found that the equipotential surfaces were in the form of spheres, with the
point charge at the center. Given that a conducting sphere in electrostatic equilibrium is a spherical equipotential
surface, we should expect that we could replace one of the surfaces in Example 7.19 with a conducting sphere and
have an identical solution outside the sphere. Inside will be rather different, however.

                            FIGURE 7.38 An isolated conducting sphere.

To investigate this, consider the isolated conducting sphere of Figure 7.38 that has a radius R and an excess charge
q. To find the electric field both inside and outside the sphere, note that the sphere is isolated, so its surface change
distribution and the electric field of that distribution are spherically symmetric. We can therefore represent the field

as     To calculate E(r), we apply Gauss's law over a closed spherical surface S of radius r that is concentric

with the conducting sphere. Since r is constant and  on the sphere,

For    , S is within the conductor, so recall from our previous study of Gauss's law that             and Gauss's law

gives  , as expected inside a conductor at equilibrium. If           , S encloses the conductor so

From Gauss's law,

The electric field of the sphere may therefore be written as

As expected, in the region  the electric field due to a charge q placed on an isolated conducting sphere of

radius R is identical to the electric field of a point charge q located at the center of the sphere.
306  7 · Electric Potential

     To find the electric potential inside and outside the sphere, note that for     the potential must be the same as

     that of an isolated point charge q located at        ,

     simply due to the similarity of the electric field.

     For                     so V(r) is constant in this region. Since

     We will use this result to show that

     for two conducting spheres of radii            , with surface charge densities       respectively, that are

     connected by a thin wire, as shown in Figure 7.39. The spheres are sufficiently separated so that each can be

     treated as if it were isolated (aside from the wire). Note that the connection by the wire means that this entire

     system must be an equipotential.

                                             FIGURE 7.39 Two conducting spheres are connected by a thin conducting wire.

     We have just seen that the electrical potential at the surface of an isolated, charged conducting sphere of radius R is

     Now, the spheres are connected by a conductor and are therefore at the same potential; hence

     and

     The net charge on a conducting sphere and its surface charge density are related by           Substituting this
     equation into the previous one, we find

     Obviously, two spheres connected by a thin wire do not constitute a typical conductor with a variable radius of
     curvature. Nevertheless, this result does at least provide a qualitative idea of how charge density varies over the
     surface of a conductor. The equation indicates that where the radius of curvature is large (points B and D in Figure
     7.40), and E are small.

     Similarly, the charges tend to be denser where the curvature of the surface is greater, as demonstrated by the
     charge distribution on oddly shaped metal (Figure 7.40). The surface charge density is higher at locations with a

small radius of curvature than at locations with a large radius of curvature.

      FIGURE 7.40 The surface charge density and the electric field of a conductor are greater at regions with smaller radii of curvature.

A practical application of this phenomenon is the lightning rod, which is simply a grounded metal rod with a sharp
end pointing upward. As positive charge accumulates in the ground due to a negatively charged cloud overhead, the
electric field around the sharp point gets very large. When the field reaches a value of approximately
(the dielectric strength of the air), the free ions in the air are accelerated to such high energies that their collisions
with air molecules actually ionize the molecules. The resulting free electrons in the air then flow through the rod to
Earth, thereby neutralizing some of the positive charge. This keeps the electric field between the cloud and the
ground from getting large enough to produce a lightning bolt in the region around the rod.

An important application of electric fields and equipotential lines involves the heart. The heart relies on electrical
signals to maintain its rhythm. The movement of electrical signals causes the chambers of the heart to contract and
relax. When a person has a heart attack, the movement of these electrical signals may be disturbed. An artificial
pacemaker and a defibrillator can be used to initiate the rhythm of electrical signals. The equipotential lines around
the heart, the thoracic region, and the axis of the heart are useful ways of monitoring the structure and functions of
the heart. An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the small electric signals being generated during the activity of the
heart.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

    · Describe some of the many practical applications of electrostatics, including several printing technologies
    · Relate these applications to Newton's second law and the electric force

The study of electrostatics has proven useful in many areas. This module covers just a few of the many applications
of electrostatics.
308  7 · Electric Potential

     The Van de Graaff Generator

     Van de Graaff generators (or Van de Graaffs) are not only spectacular devices used to demonstrate high voltage
     due to static electricity--they are also used for serious research. The first was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931
     (based on original suggestions by Lord Kelvin) for use in nuclear physics research. Figure 7.41 shows a schematic of
     a large research version. Van de Graaffs use both smooth and pointed surfaces, and conductors and insulators to
     generate large static charges and, hence, large voltages.

     A very large excess charge can be deposited on the sphere because it moves quickly to the outer surface. Practical
     limits arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually ionize surrounding materials, creating free
     charges that neutralize excess charge or allow it to escape. Nevertheless, voltages of 15 million volts are well within
     practical limits.

     FIGURE 7.41 Schematic of Van de Graaff generator. A battery (A) supplies excess positive charge to a pointed conductor, the points of
     which spray the charge onto a moving insulating belt near the bottom. The pointed conductor (B) on top in the large sphere picks up the
     charge. (The induced electric field at the points is so large that it removes the charge from the belt.) This can be done because the charge
     does not remain inside the conducting sphere but moves to its outside surface. An ion source inside the sphere produces positive ions,
     which are accelerated away from the positive sphere to high velocities.

     Xerography

     Most copy machines use an electrostatic process called xerography--a word coined from the Greek words xeros for
     dry and graphos for writing. The heart of the process is shown in simplified form in Figure 7.42.

     Access for free at openstax.org
7.6 · Applications of Electrostatics                                                                                                         309

FIGURE 7.42 Xerography is a dry copying process based on electrostatics. The major steps in the process are the charging of the
photoconducting drum, transfer of an image, creating a positive charge duplicate, attraction of toner to the charged parts of the drum, and
transfer of toner to the paper. Not shown are heat treatment of the paper and cleansing of the drum for the next copy.

A selenium-coated aluminum drum is sprayed with positive charge from points on a device called a corotron.
Selenium is a substance with an interesting property--it is a photoconductor. That is, selenium is an insulator when
in the dark and a conductor when exposed to light.

In the first stage of the xerography process, the conducting aluminum drum is grounded so that a negative charge is
induced under the thin layer of uniformly positively charged selenium. In the second stage, the surface of the drum
is exposed to the image of whatever is to be copied. In locations where the image is light, the selenium becomes
conducting, and the positive charge is neutralized. In dark areas, the positive charge remains, so the image has been
transferred to the drum.

The third stage takes a dry black powder, called toner, and sprays it with a negative charge so that it is attracted to
the positive regions of the drum. Next, a blank piece of paper is given a greater positive charge than on the drum so
that it will pull the toner from the drum. Finally, the paper and electrostatically held toner are passed through heated
pressure rollers, which melt and permanently adhere the toner to the fibers of the paper.

Laser Printers

Laser printers use the xerographic process to make high-quality images on paper, employing a laser to produce an
image on the photoconducting drum as shown in Figure 7.43. In its most common application, the laser printer
receives output from a computer, and it can achieve high-quality output because of the precision with which laser
light can be controlled. Many laser printers do significant information processing, such as making sophisticated
letters or fonts, and in the past may have contained a computer more powerful than the one giving them the raw
data to be printed.
310  7 · Electric Potential

     FIGURE 7.43 In a laser printer, a laser beam is scanned across a photoconducting drum, leaving a positively charged image. The other
     steps for charging the drum and transferring the image to paper are the same as in xerography. Laser light can be very precisely controlled,
     enabling laser printers to produce high-quality images.

     Ink Jet Printers and Electrostatic Painting

     The ink jet printer, commonly used to print computer-generated text and graphics, also employs electrostatics. A
     nozzle makes a fine spray of tiny ink droplets, which are then given an electrostatic charge (Figure 7.44).

     Once charged, the droplets can be directed, using pairs of charged plates, with great precision to form letters and
     images on paper. Ink jet printers can produce color images by using a black jet and three other jets with primary
     colors, usually cyan, magenta, and yellow, much as a color television produces color. (This is more difficult with
     xerography, requiring multiple drums and toners.)

     FIGURE 7.44 The nozzle of an ink-jet printer produces small ink droplets, which are sprayed with electrostatic charge. Various computer-
     driven devices are then used to direct the droplets to the correct positions on a page.

     Electrostatic painting employs electrostatic charge to spray paint onto oddly shaped surfaces. Mutual repulsion of
     like charges causes the paint to fly away from its source. Surface tension forms drops, which are then attracted by
     unlike charges to the surface to be painted. Electrostatic painting can reach hard-to-get-to places, applying an even
     coat in a controlled manner. If the object is a conductor, the electric field is perpendicular to the surface, tending to
     bring the drops in perpendicularly. Corners and points on conductors will receive extra paint. Felt can similarly be
     applied.

     Smoke Precipitators and Electrostatic Air Cleaning

     Another important application of electrostatics is found in air cleaners, both large and small. The electrostatic part
     of the process places excess (usually positive) charge on smoke, dust, pollen, and other particles in the air and then
     passes the air through an oppositely charged grid that attracts and retains the charged particles (Figure 7.45)

     Large electrostatic precipitators are used industrially to remove over  of the particles from stack gas emissions

     associated with the burning of coal and oil. Home precipitators, often in conjunction with the home heating and air

     conditioning system, are very effective in removing polluting particles, irritants, and allergens.

INTRODUCTION Capacitors are important components of electrical circuits in many electronic devices, including
pacemakers, cell phones, and computers. In this chapter, we study their properties, and, over the next few chapters,
we examine their function in combination with other circuit elements. By themselves, capacitors are often used to
store electrical energy and release it when needed; with other circuit components, capacitors often act as part of a
filter that allows some electrical signals to pass while blocking others. You can see why capacitors are considered
one of the fundamental components of electrical circuits.

8.1 Capacitors and Capacitance

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the concepts of a capacitor and its capacitance
    · Describe how to evaluate the capacitance of a system of conductors
A capacitor is a device used to store electrical charge and electrical energy. Capacitors are generally with two
electrical conductors separated by a distance. (Note that such electrical conductors are sometimes referred to as
"electrodes," but more correctly, they are "capacitor plates.") The space between capacitors may simply be a
vacuum, and, in that case, a capacitor is then known as a "vacuum capacitor." However, the space is usually filled
with an insulating material known as a dielectric. (You will learn more about dielectrics in the sections on dielectrics
324  8 · Capacitance

     later in this chapter.) The amount of storage in a capacitor is determined by a property called capacitance, which you
     will learn more about a bit later in this section.

     Capacitors have applications ranging from filtering static from radio reception to energy storage in heart
     defibrillators. Typically, commercial capacitors have two conducting parts close to one another but not touching,
     such as those in Figure 8.2. Most of the time, a dielectric is used between the two plates. When battery terminals
     are connected to an initially uncharged capacitor, the battery potential moves a small amount of charge of
     magnitude Q from the positive plate to the negative plate. The capacitor remains neutral overall, but with charges

          and residing on opposite plates.

     FIGURE 8.2 Both capacitors shown here were initially uncharged before being connected to a battery. They now have charges of and
          (respectively) on their plates. (a) A parallel-plate capacitor consists of two plates of opposite charge with area A separated by distance

     d. (b) A rolled capacitor has a dielectric material between its two conducting sheets (plates).

     A system composed of two identical parallel-conducting plates separated by a distance is called a parallel-plate

     capacitor (Figure 8.3). The magnitude of the electrical field in the space between the parallel plates is  ,

     where denotes the surface charge density on one plate (recall that is the charge Q per the surface area A). Thus,

     the magnitude of the field is directly proportional to Q.

FIGURE 8.3 The charge separation in a capacitor shows that the charges remain on the surfaces of the capacitor plates. Electrical field lines
in a parallel-plate capacitor begin with positive charges and end with negative charges. The magnitude of the electrical field in the space
between the plates is in direct proportion to the amount of charge on the capacitor.

Capacitors with different physical characteristics (such as shape and size of their plates) store different amounts of
charge for the same applied voltage V across their plates. The capacitance C of a capacitor is defined as the ratio of
the maximum charge Q that can be stored in a capacitor to the applied voltage V across its plates. In other words,
capacitance is the largest amount of charge per volt that can be stored on the device:

                                                                                                                                                       8.1

Note that in Equation 8.1, V represents the potential difference between the capacitor plates, not the potential at
any one point. While it would be more accurate to write it as V, the practice of using a plain V in this context is
nearly universal.

The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (F), named after Michael Faraday (1791-1867). Since capacitance is the
charge per unit voltage, one farad is one coulomb per one volt, or

By definition, a 1.0-F capacitor is able to store 1.0 C of charge (a very large amount of charge) when the potential

difference between its plates is only 1.0 V. One farad is therefore a very large capacitance. Typical capacitance

values range from picofarads  to millifarads  , which also includes microfarads

(  ). Capacitors can be produced in various shapes and sizes (Figure 8.4).

     value. (credit: Windell Oskay)

     Calculation of Capacitance

     We can calculate the capacitance of a pair of conductors with the standard approach that follows.

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Calculating Capacitance

       1. Assume that the capacitor has a charge Q.
       2. Determine the electrical field between the conductors. If symmetry is present in the arrangement of

             conductors, you may be able to use Gauss's law for this calculation.
       3. Find the potential difference between the conductors from

                                                                                                                                                            8.2

     where the path of integration leads from one conductor to the other. The magnitude of the potential difference

     is then                          .

     4. With V known, obtain the capacitance directly from Equation 8.1.

     To show how this procedure works, we now calculate the capacitances of parallel-plate, spherical, and cylindrical
     capacitors. In all cases, we assume vacuum capacitors (empty capacitors) with no dielectric substance in the space
     between conductors.

     Parallel-Plate Capacitor

     The parallel-plate capacitor (Figure 8.5) has two identical conducting plates, each having a surface area A,
     separated by a distance d. When a voltage V is applied to the capacitor, it stores a charge Q, as shown. We can see
     how its capacitance may depend on A and d by considering characteristics of the Coulomb force. We know that force
     between the charges increases with charge values and decreases with the distance between them. We should
     expect that the bigger the plates are, the more charge they can store. Thus, C should be greater for a larger value of
     A. Similarly, the closer the plates are together, the greater the attraction of the opposite charges on them. Therefore,
     C should be greater for a smaller d.

             FIGURE 8.5 In a parallel-plate capacitor with plates separated by a distance d, each plate has the same surface area A.

We define the surface charge density on the plates as

We know from previous chapters that when d is small, the electrical field between the plates is fairly uniform
(ignoring edge effects) and that its magnitude is given by

where the constant is the permittivity of free space,        The SI unit of F/m is equivalent to

Since the electrical field between the plates is uniform, the potential difference between the plates is

Therefore Equation 8.1 gives the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor as
                                                                                                                                                       8.3

Notice from this equation that capacitance is a function only of the geometry and what material fills the space
between the plates (in this case, vacuum) of this capacitor. In fact, this is true not only for a parallel-plate capacitor,
but for all capacitors: The capacitance is independent of Q or V. If the charge changes, the potential changes
correspondingly so that Q/V remains constant.

(a) What is the capacitance of an empty parallel-plate capacitor with metal plates that each have an area of

, separated by 1.00 mm? (b) How much charge is stored in this capacitor if a voltage of                                               is

applied to it?
328  8 · Capacitance

     Strategy
     Finding the capacitance C is a straightforward application of Equation 8.3. Once we find C, we can find the charge
     stored by using Equation 8.1.

     Solution

       a. Entering the given values into Equation 8.3 yields

             This small capacitance value indicates how difficult it is to make a device with a large capacitance.
       b. Inverting Equation 8.1 and entering the known values into this equation gives

     Significance
     This charge is only slightly greater than those found in typical static electricity applications. Since air breaks down
     (becomes conductive) at an electrical field strength of about 3.0 MV/m, much more charge can be stored on this
     capacitor by increasing the voltage.

             EXAMPLE 8.2

     A 1-F Parallel-Plate Capacitor

     Suppose you wish to construct a parallel-plate capacitor with a capacitance of 1.0 F. What area must you use for
     each plate if the plates are separated by 1.0 mm?
     Solution
     Rearranging Equation 8.3, we obtain

     Each square plate would have to be 10 km across. It used to be a common prank to ask a student to go to the
     laboratory stockroom and request a 1-F parallel-plate capacitor, until stockroom attendants got tired of the joke.

     Spherical Capacitor

     A spherical capacitor is another set of conductors whose capacitance can be easily determined (Figure 8.6). It
     consists of two concentric conducting spherical shells of radii (inner shell) and (outer shell). The shells are
     given equal and opposite charges and , respectively. From symmetry, the electrical field between the shells
     is directed radially outward. We can obtain the magnitude of the field by applying Gauss's law over a spherical
     Gaussian surface of radius r concentric with the shells. The enclosed charge is ; therefore we have

                                                                            8.1 · Capacitors and Capacitance                             329

Thus, the electrical field between the conductors is

We substitute this into Equation 8.2 and integrate along a radial path between the shells. Since, as noted in the
problem solving strategy, V in Equation 8.1 is the magnitude of the potential difference, the integration path should
be against the direction of the electric field, from to :

                                                          

We substitute this result into Equation 8.1 to find the capacitance of a spherical capacitor:

                                                                                                                                    8.4

Since we want the magnitude of , we could just take the absolute value at the end and not worry about tracking

the minus signs. We can see that   gives us a positive capacitance, as required.

FIGURE 8.6 A spherical capacitor consists of two concentric conducting spheres. Note that the charges on a conductor reside on its
surface.

Capacitance of an Isolated Sphere

Calculate the capacitance of a single isolated conducting sphere of radius  and compare it with Equation 8.4 in

the limit as  .

Strategy
We assume that the charge on the sphere is Q, and so we follow the four steps outlined earlier. We also assume the
other conductor to be a concentric hollow sphere of infinite radius.

Solution
On the outside of an isolated conducting sphere, the electrical field is given by Equation 8.2. The magnitude of the
potential difference between the surface of an isolated sphere and infinity is

     The capacitance of an isolated sphere is therefore

     Significance                                                             . A single isolated sphere is
     The same result can be obtained by taking the limit of Equation 8.4 as

     therefore equivalent to a spherical capacitor whose outer shell has an infinitely large radius.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 8.3

     The radius of the outer sphere of a spherical capacitor is five times the radius of its inner shell. What are the
     dimensions of this capacitor if its capacitance is 5.00 pF?

     Cylindrical Capacitor

     A cylindrical capacitor consists of two concentric, conducting cylinders (Figure 8.7). The inner cylinder, of radius ,
     may either be a shell or be completely solid. The outer cylinder is a shell of inner radius . We assume that the
     length of each cylinder is l and that the excess charges and reside on the inner and outer cylinders,
     respectively.

     FIGURE 8.7 A cylindrical capacitor consists of two concentric, conducting cylinders. Here, the charge on the outer surface of the inner
     cylinder is positive (indicated by ) and the charge on the inner surface of the outer cylinder is negative (indicated by ).

     With edge effects ignored, the electrical field between the conductors is directed radially outward from the common
     axis of the cylinders. Using the Gaussian surface shown in Figure 8.7, we have

     Therefore, the electrical field between the cylinders is
                                                                                                                                                            8.5

     Here is the unit radial vector along the radius of the cylinder. We can substitute into Equation 8.2 and find the
     potential difference between the cylinders:

8.1 · Capacitors and Capacitance                                                                                                                            331

Thus, the capacitance of a cylindrical capacitor is

                                                                                                                                                       8.6

As in other cases, this capacitance depends only on the geometry of the conductor arrangement. An important
application of Equation 8.6 is the determination of the capacitance per unit length of a coaxial cable, which is
commonly used to transmit time-varying electrical signals. A coaxial cable consists of two concentric, cylindrical
conductors separated by an insulating material. (Here, we assume a vacuum between the conductors, but the
physics is qualitatively almost the same when the space between the conductors is filled by a dielectric.) This
configuration shields the electrical signal propagating down the inner conductor from stray electrical fields external
to the cable. Current flows in opposite directions in the inner and the outer conductors, with the outer conductor
usually grounded. Now, from Equation 8.6, the capacitance per unit length of the coaxial cable is given by

In practical applications, it is important to select specific values of C/l. This can be accomplished with appropriate
choices of radii of the conductors and of the insulating material between them.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 8.4

When a cylindrical capacitor is given a charge of 0.500 nC, a potential difference of 20.0 V is measured between the
cylinders. (a) What is the capacitance of this system? (b) If the cylinders are 1.0 m long, what is the ratio of their
radii?

Several types of practical capacitors are shown in Figure 8.4. Common capacitors are often made of two small
pieces of metal foil separated by two small pieces of insulation (see Figure 8.2(b)). The metal foil and insulation are
encased in a protective coating, and two metal leads are used for connecting the foils to an external circuit. Some
common insulating materials are mica, ceramic, paper, and TeflonTM non-stick coating.

Another popular type of capacitor is an electrolytic capacitor. It consists of an oxidized metal in a conducting paste.
The main advantage of an electrolytic capacitor is its high capacitance relative to other common types of capacitors.
For example, capacitance of one type of aluminum electrolytic capacitor can be as high as 1.0 F. However, you must
be careful when using an electrolytic capacitor in a circuit, because it only functions correctly when the metal foil is
at a higher potential than the conducting paste. When reverse polarization occurs, electrolytic action destroys the
oxide film. This type of capacitor cannot be connected across an alternating current source, because half of the
time, ac voltage would have the wrong polarity, as an alternating current reverses its polarity (see Alternating-
Current Circuits on alternating-current circuits).

A variable air capacitor (Figure 8.8) has two sets of parallel plates. One set of plates is fixed (indicated as "stator"),
and the other set of plates is attached to a shaft that can be rotated (indicated as "rotor"). By turning the shaft, the
cross-sectional area in the overlap of the plates can be changed; therefore, the capacitance of this system can be
tuned to a desired value. Capacitor tuning has applications in any type of radio transmission and in receiving radio
signals from electronic devices. Any time you tune your car radio to your favorite station, think of capacitance.

     by Robbie Sproule)

     The symbols shown in Figure 8.9 are circuit representations of various types of capacitors. We generally use the
     symbol shown in Figure 8.9(a). The symbol in Figure 8.9(c) represents a variable-capacitance capacitor. Notice the
     similarity of these symbols to the symmetry of a parallel-plate capacitor. An electrolytic capacitor is represented by
     the symbol in part Figure 8.9(b), where the curved plate indicates the negative terminal.

     FIGURE 8.9 This shows three different circuit representations of capacitors. The symbol in (a) is the most commonly used one. The symbol
     in (b) represents an electrolytic capacitor. The symbol in (c) represents a variable-capacitance capacitor.

     An interesting applied example of a capacitor model comes from cell biology and deals with the electrical potential
     in the plasma membrane of a living cell (Figure 8.10). Cell membranes separate cells from their surroundings but
     allow some selected ions to pass in or out of the cell. The potential difference across a membrane is about 70 mV.
     The cell membrane may be 7 to 10 nm thick. Treating the cell membrane as a nano-sized capacitor, the estimate of
     the smallest electrical field strength across its `plates' yields the value

                                                                            .
     This magnitude of electrical field is great enough to create an electrical spark in the air.

FIGURE 8.10 The semipermeable membrane of a biological cell has different concentrations of ions on its interior surface than on its
exterior. Diffusion moves the (potassium) and (chloride) ions in the directions shown, until the Coulomb force halts further transfer.
In this way, the exterior of the membrane acquires a positive charge and its interior surface acquires a negative charge, creating a potential
difference across the membrane. The membrane is normally impermeable to Na+ (sodium ions).

The electrical charges involved with the cell membrane result in critical biological processes. Ernest Everett Just,
whose expertise in understanding and handling egg cells led to a number of major discoveries, investigated the role
of the cell membrane in reproductive fertilization. In one key experiment, Just established that the egg membrane
undergoes a depolarizing "wave of negativity" the moment it fuses with a sperm cell. This change in charge is now
known as the "fast block" that ensures that only one sperm cell fuses with an egg cell, which is critical for embryonic
development.

        network and determine the net capacitance of a network of capacitors

Several capacitors can be connected together to be used in a variety of applications. Multiple connections of
capacitors behave as a single equivalent capacitor. The total capacitance of this equivalent single capacitor depends
both on the individual capacitors and how they are connected. Capacitors can be arranged in two simple and
common types of connections, known as series and parallel, for which we can easily calculate the total capacitance.
These two basic combinations, series and parallel, can also be used as part of more complex connections.

The Series Combination of Capacitors

Figure 8.11 illustrates a series combination of three capacitors, arranged in a row within the circuit. As for any
capacitor, the capacitance of the combination is related to the charge and voltage by using Equation 8.1. When this
series combination is connected to a battery with voltage V, each of the capacitors acquires an identical charge Q. To
explain, first note that the charge on the plate connected to the positive terminal of the battery is and the charge
on the plate connected to the negative terminal is . Charges are then induced on the other plates so that the sum
334  8 · Capacitance

     of the charges on all plates, and the sum of charges on any pair of capacitor plates, is zero. However, the potential

     drop             on one capacitor may be different from the potential drop              on another capacitor,

     because, generally, the capacitors may have different capacitances. The series combination of two or three

     capacitors resembles a single capacitor with a smaller capacitance. Generally, any number of capacitors connected

     in series is equivalent to one capacitor whose capacitance (called the equivalent capacitance) is smaller than the

     smallest of the capacitances in the series combination. Charge on this equivalent capacitor is the same as the

     charge on any capacitor in a series combination: That is, all capacitors of a series combination have the same

     charge. This occurs due to the conservation of charge in the circuit. When a charge Q in a series circuit is removed

     from a plate of the first capacitor (which we denote as ), it must be placed on a plate of the second capacitor

     (which we denote as  and so on.

     FIGURE 8.11 (a) Three capacitors are connected in series. The magnitude of the charge on each plate is Q. (b) The network of capacitors in
     (a) is equivalent to one capacitor that has a smaller capacitance than any of the individual capacitances in (a), and the charge on its plates is
     Q.

     We can find an expression for the total (equivalent) capacitance by considering the voltages across the individual

     capacitors. The potentials across capacitors 1, 2, and 3 are, respectively,  ,                       , and             .

     These potentials must sum up to the voltage of the battery, giving the following potential balance:

     Potential V is measured across an equivalent capacitor that holds charge Q and has an equivalent capacitance .
     Entering the expressions for , , and , we get

     Canceling the charge Q, we obtain an expression containing the equivalent capacitance,  , of three capacitors
     connected in series:

     This expression can be generalized to any number of capacitors in a series network.

       SERIES COMBINATION

       For capacitors connected in a series combination, the reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance is the sum of
       reciprocals of individual capacitances:

Because there are only three capacitors in this network, we can find the equivalent capacitance by using Equation

Solution
We enter the given capacitances into Equation 8.7:

Now we invert this result and obtain

Significance
Note that in a series network of capacitors, the equivalent capacitance is always less than the smallest individual
capacitance in the network.

The Parallel Combination of Capacitors

A parallel combination of three capacitors, with one plate of each capacitor connected to one side of the circuit and
the other plate connected to the other side, is illustrated in Figure 8.12(a). Since the capacitors are connected in
parallel, they all have the same voltage V across their plates. However, each capacitor in the parallel network may
store a different charge. To find the equivalent capacitance of the parallel network, we note that the total charge
Q stored by the network is the sum of all the individual charges:

On the left-hand side of this equation, we use the relation  , which holds for the entire network. On the
right-hand side of the equation, we use the relations
capacitors in the network. In this way we obtain             and  for the three

This equation, when simplified, is the expression for the equivalent capacitance of the parallel network of three
capacitors:

This expression is easily generalized to any number of capacitors connected in parallel in the network.

  PARALLEL COMBINATION

  For capacitors connected in a parallel combination, the equivalent (net) capacitance is the sum of all individual
  capacitances in the network,

     Capacitor networks are usually some combination of series and parallel connections, as shown in Figure 8.13. To
     find the net capacitance of such combinations, we identify parts that contain only series or only parallel
     connections, and find their equivalent capacitances. We repeat this process until we can determine the equivalent

8.3 Energy Stored in a Capacitor

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain how energy is stored in a capacitor
    · Use energy relations to determine the energy stored in a capacitor network

Most of us have seen dramatizations of medical personnel using a defibrillator to pass an electrical current through
a patient's heart to get it to beat normally. Often realistic in detail, the person applying the shock directs another
person to "make it 400 joules this time." The energy delivered by the defibrillator is stored in a capacitor and can be
adjusted to fit the situation. SI units of joules are often employed. Less dramatic is the use of capacitors in
microelectronics to supply energy when batteries are charged (Figure 8.15). Capacitors are also used to supply
energy for flash lamps on cameras.
340  8 · Capacitance

     FIGURE 8.15 The capacitors on the circuit board for an electronic device follow a labeling convention that identifies each one with a code
     that begins with the letter "C." (credit: Windell Oskay)

     The energy stored in a capacitor is electrostatic potential energy and is thus related to the charge Q and voltage
     V between the capacitor plates. A charged capacitor stores energy in the electrical field between its plates. As the
     capacitor is being charged, the electrical field builds up. When a charged capacitor is disconnected from a battery,
     its energy remains in the field in the space between its plates.

     To gain insight into how this energy may be expressed (in terms of Q and V), consider a charged, empty, parallel-

     plate capacitor; that is, a capacitor without a dielectric but with a vacuum between its plates. The space between its

     plates has a volume Ad, and it is filled with a uniform electrostatic field E. The total energy of the capacitor is

     contained within this space. The energy density in this space is simply divided by the volume Ad. If we know

     the energy density, the energy can be found as                 . We will learn in Electromagnetic Waves (after

     completing the study of Maxwell's equations) that the energy density in a region of free space occupied by an

     electrical field E depends only on the magnitude of the field and is

                                                                                                                          8.9

     If we multiply the energy density by the volume between the plates, we obtain the amount of energy stored
     between the plates of a parallel-plate

     capacitor:                                                                .

     In this derivation, we used the fact that the electrical field between the plates is uniform so that  and

                 Because              , we can express this result in other equivalent forms:

                                                                                                                     8.10

     The expression in Equation 8.10 for the energy stored in a parallel-plate capacitor is generally valid for all types of

     capacitors. To see this, consider any uncharged capacitor (not necessarily a parallel-plate type). At some instant, we

     connect it across a battery, giving it a potential difference         between its plates. Initially, the charge on the

     plates is        As the capacitor is being charged, the charge gradually builds up on its plates, and after some time,

     it reaches the value Q. To move an infinitesimal charge dq from the negative plate to the positive plate (from a lower

     to a higher potential), the amount of work dW that must be done on dq is                  .

     This work becomes the energy stored in the electrical field of the capacitor. In order to charge the capacitor to a
     charge Q, the total work required is

     Since the geometry of the capacitor has not been specified, this equation holds for any type of capacitor. The total

     work W needed to charge a capacitor is the electrical potential energy stored in it, or               . When the charge

is expressed in coulombs, potential is expressed in volts, and the capacitance is expressed in farads, this relation
gives the energy in joules.

Knowing that the energy stored in a capacitor is       , we can now find the energy density stored in a

vacuum between the plates of a charged parallel-plate capacitor. We just have to divide by the volume Ad of

space between its plates and take into account that for a parallel-plate capacitor, we have     and

             . Therefore, we obtain

We see that this expression for the density of energy stored in a parallel-plate capacitor is in accordance with the
general relation expressed in Equation 8.9. We could repeat this calculation for either a spherical capacitor or a
cylindrical capacitor--or other capacitors--and in all cases, we would end up with the general relation given by
Equation 8.9.

In a cardiac emergency, a portable electronic device known as an automated external defibrillator (AED) can be a
lifesaver. A defibrillator (Figure 8.16) delivers a large charge in a short burst, or a shock, to a person's heart to
correct abnormal heart rhythm (an arrhythmia). A heart attack can arise from the onset of fast, irregular beating of
the heart--called cardiac or ventricular fibrillation. Applying a large shock of electrical energy can terminate the
arrhythmia and allow the body's natural pacemaker to resume its normal rhythm. Today, it is common for
ambulances to carry AEDs. AEDs are also found in many public places. These are designed to be used by lay

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the effects a dielectric in a capacitor has on capacitance and other properties
         · Calculate the capacitance of a capacitor containing a dielectric

     As we discussed earlier, an insulating material placed between the plates of a capacitor is called a dielectric.
     Inserting a dielectric between the plates of a capacitor affects its capacitance. To see why, let's consider an
     experiment described in Figure 8.17. Initially, a capacitor with capacitance when there is air between its plates
     is charged by a battery to voltage . When the capacitor is fully charged, the battery is disconnected. A charge
     then resides on the plates, and the potential difference between the plates is measured to be . Now, suppose we
     insert a dielectric that totally fills the gap between the plates. If we monitor the voltage, we find that the voltmeter

reading has dropped to a smaller value V. We write this new voltage value as a fraction of the original voltage ,

with a positive number ,        :

The constant in this equation is called the dielectric constant of the material between the plates, and its value is
characteristic for the material. A detailed explanation for why the dielectric reduces the voltage is given in the next
section. Different materials have different dielectric constants (a table of values for typical materials is provided in
the next section). Once the battery becomes disconnected, there is no path for a charge to flow to the battery from
the capacitor plates. Hence, the insertion of the dielectric has no effect on the charge on the plate, which remains at
a value of . Therefore, we find that the capacitance of the capacitor with a dielectric is

                                                                                                                                                     8.11

This equation tells us that the capacitance of an empty (vacuum) capacitor can be increased by a factor of

when we insert a dielectric material to completely fill the space between its plates. Note that Equation 8.11 can also

be used for an empty capacitor by setting  . In other words, we can say that the dielectric constant of the

vacuum is 1, which is a reference value.

FIGURE 8.17 (a) When fully charged, a vacuum capacitor has a voltage and charge (the charges remain on plate's inner surfaces; the

schematic indicates the sign of charge on each plate). (b) In step 1, the battery is disconnected. Then, in step 2, a dielectric (that is

electrically neutral) is inserted into the charged capacitor. When the voltage across the capacitor is now measured, it is found that the

voltage value has decreased to           . The schematic indicates the sign of the induced charge that is now present on the surfaces of the

dielectric material between the plates.

The principle expressed by Equation 8.11 is widely used in the construction industry (Figure 8.18). Metal plates in
an electronic stud finder act effectively as a capacitor. You place a stud finder with its flat side on the wall and move
it continually in the horizontal direction. When the finder moves over a wooden stud, the capacitance of its plates
changes, because wood has a different dielectric constant than a gypsum wall. This change triggers a signal in a
circuit, and thus the stud is detected.

       FIGURE 8.18 An electronic stud finder is used to detect wooden studs behind drywall. (credit top: modification of work by Jane Whitney)

     The electrical energy stored by a capacitor is also affected by the presence of a dielectric. When the energy stored in
     an empty capacitor is , the energy U stored in a capacitor with a dielectric is smaller by a factor of ,

                                                                                                                                                          8.12

     As a dielectric material sample is brought near an empty charged capacitor, the sample reacts to the electrical field
     of the charges on the capacitor plates. Just as we learned in Electric Charges and Fields on electrostatics, there will
     be the induced charges on the surface of the sample; however, they are not free charges like in a conductor, because
     a perfect insulator does not have freely moving charges. These induced charges on the dielectric surface are of an
     opposite sign to the free charges on the plates of the capacitor, and so they are attracted by the free charges on the
     plates. Consequently, the dielectric is "pulled" into the gap, and the work to polarize the dielectric material between
     the plates is done at the expense of the stored electrical energy, which is reduced, in accordance with Equation
     8.12.

     An empty 20.0-pF capacitor is charged to a potential difference of 40.0 V. The charging battery is then

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the polarization of a dielectric in a uniform electrical field
    · Describe the effect of a polarized dielectric on the electrical field between capacitor plates
    · Explain dielectric breakdown

We can understand the effect of a dielectric on capacitance by looking at its behavior at the molecular level. As we
have seen in earlier chapters, in general, all molecules can be classified as either polar or nonpolar. There is a net
separation of positive and negative charges in an isolated polar molecule, whereas there is no charge separation in
an isolated nonpolar molecule (Figure 8.19). In other words, polar molecules have permanent electric-dipole
moments and nonpolar molecules do not. For example, a molecule of water is polar, and a molecule of oxygen is
nonpolar. Nonpolar molecules can become polar in the presence of an external electrical field, which is called
induced polarization.

     FIGURE 8.19 The concept of polarization: In an unpolarized atom or molecule, a negatively charged electron cloud is evenly distributed
     around positively charged centers, whereas a polarized atom or molecule has an excess of negative charge at one side so that the other
     side has an excess of positive charge. However, the entire system remains electrically neutral. The charge polarization may be caused by an
     external electrical field. Some molecules and atoms are permanently polarized (electric dipoles) even in the absence of an external
     electrical field (polar molecules and atoms).

     Let's first consider a dielectric composed of polar molecules. In the absence of any external electrical field, the
     electric dipoles are oriented randomly, as illustrated in Figure 8.20(a). However, if the dielectric is placed in an

     external electrical field , the polar molecules align with the external field, as shown in part (b) of the figure.
     Opposite charges on adjacent dipoles within the volume of dielectric neutralize each other, so there is no net charge
     within the dielectric (see the dashed circles in part (b)). However, this is not the case very close to the upper and
     lower surfaces that border the dielectric (the region enclosed by the dashed rectangles in part (b)), where the
     alignment does produce a net charge. Since the external electrical field merely aligns the dipoles, the dielectric as a
     whole is neutral, and the surface charges induced on its opposite faces are equal and opposite. These induced

     surface charges  and  produce an additional electrical field (an induced electrical field), which

     opposes the external field , as illustrated in part (c).

     FIGURE 8.20 A dielectric with polar molecules: (a) In the absence of an external electrical field; (b) in the presence of an external electrical
     field . The dashed lines indicate the regions immediately adjacent to the capacitor plates. (c) The induced electrical field inside the
     dielectric produced by the induced surface charge of the dielectric. Note that, in reality, the individual molecules are not perfectly
     aligned with an external field because of thermal fluctuations; however, the average alignment is along the field lines as shown.

The same effect is produced when the molecules of a dielectric are nonpolar. In this case, a nonpolar molecule
acquires an induced electric-dipole moment because the external field causes a separation between its
positive and negative charges. The induced dipoles of the nonpolar molecules align with in the same way as the
permanent dipoles of the polar molecules are aligned (shown in part (b)). Hence, the electrical field within the
dielectric is weakened regardless of whether its molecules are polar or nonpolar.

Therefore, when the region between the parallel plates of a charged capacitor, such as that shown in Figure 8.21(a),
is filled with a dielectric, within the dielectric there is an electrical field due to the free charge on the
capacitor plates and an electrical field due to the induced charge on the surfaces of the dielectric. Their
vector sum gives the net electrical field within the dielectric between the capacitor plates (shown in part (b) of the
figure):

                                                                                                                                                     8.13

This net field can be considered to be the field produced by an effective charge  on the capacitor.

         FIGURE 8.21 Electrical field: (a) In an empty capacitor, electrical field . (b) In a dielectric-filled capacitor, electrical field .

In most dielectrics, the net electrical field is proportional to the field produced by the free charge. In terms of
these two electrical fields, the dielectric constant of the material is defined as

                                                                                                                                                     8.14

Since and point in opposite directions, the magnitude E is smaller than the magnitude and therefore
         Combining Equation 8.14 with Equation 8.13, and rearranging the terms, yields the following expression for

the induced electrical field in a dielectric:

                                                                                                                                                     8.15

When the magnitude of an external electrical field becomes too large, the molecules of dielectric material start to
become ionized. A molecule or an atom is ionized when one or more electrons are removed from it and become free
electrons, no longer bound to the molecular or atomic structure. When this happens, the material can conduct,
thereby allowing charge to move through the dielectric from one capacitor plate to the other. This phenomenon is
called dielectric breakdown. (Figure 8.1 shows typical random-path patterns of electrical discharge during
348  8 · Capacitance

     dielectric breakdown.) The critical value, , of the electrical field at which the molecules of an insulator become

     ionized is called the dielectric strength of the material. The dielectric strength imposes a limit on the voltage that

     can be applied for a given plate separation in a capacitor. For example, the dielectric strength of air is

                      , so for an air-filled capacitor with a plate separation of        the limit on the potential

     difference that can be safely applied across its plates without causing dielectric breakdown is

                                                           .

     However, this limit becomes 60.0 kV when the same capacitor is filled with TeflonTM, whose dielectric strength is

     about            . Because of this limit imposed by the dielectric strength, the amount of charge that an air-filled

     capacitor can store is only      and the charge stored on the same TeflonTM-filled capacitor can be

     as much as

     which is about 42 times greater than a charge stored on an air-filled capacitor. Typical values of dielectric constants
     and dielectric strengths for various materials are given in Table 8.1. Notice that the dielectric constant is exactly
     1.0 for a vacuum (the empty space serves as a reference condition) and very close to 1.0 for air under normal
     conditions (normal pressure at room temperature). These two values are so close that, in fact, the properties of an
     air-filled capacitor are essentially the same as those of an empty capacitor.

Not all substances listed in the table are good insulators, despite their high dielectric constants. Water, for example,
consists of polar molecules and has a large dielectric constant of about 80. In a water molecule, electrons are more
likely found around the oxygen nucleus than around the hydrogen nuclei. This makes the oxygen end of the molecule
slightly negative and leaves the hydrogens end slightly positive, which makes the molecule easy to align along an
external electrical field, and thus water has a large dielectric constant. However, the polar nature of water molecules
also makes water a good solvent for many substances, which produces undesirable effects, because any
concentration of free ions in water conducts electricity.

    EXAMPLE 8.11

Electrical Field and Induced Surface Charge

Suppose that the distance between the plates of the capacitor in Example 8.10 is 2.0 mm and the area of each plate

is            . Determine: (a) the electrical field between the plates before and after the TeflonTM is inserted,

and (b) the surface charge induced on the TeflonTM surfaces.

Strategy

In part (a), we know that the voltage across the empty capacitor is      , so to find the electrical fields we use

the relation         and Equation 8.14. In part (b), knowing the magnitude of the electrical field, we use the

expression for the magnitude of electrical field near a charged plate    , where is a uniform surface charge

density caused by the surface charge. We use the value of free charge                     obtained in Example
8.10.

Solution

    a. The electrical field between the plates of an empty capacitor is

    The electrical field E with the TeflonTM in place is

    b. The effective charge on the capacitor is the difference between the free charge    and the induced charge
         . The electrical field in the TeflonTM is caused by this effective charge. Thus

     Solution

     (a) The capacitance of the filled capacitor is  . Since the battery is always connected to the capacitor plates,

     the potential difference between them does not change; hence,                  . Because of that, the electrical field in the

     The electrical field E in the filled capacitor is due to the effective charge  (Figure 8.22(b)). Since                           , we

Significance
Notice that for materials with dielectric constants larger than 2 (see Table 8.1), the induced charge on the surface of
dielectric is larger than the charge on the plates of a vacuum capacitor. The opposite is true for gasses like air whose
dielectric constant is smaller than 2.

Continuing with Example 8.12, show that when the battery is connected across the plates the energy stored in

dielectric-filled capacitor is       (larger than the energy of an empty capacitor kept at the same voltage).

INTRODUCTION In this chapter, we study the electrical current through a material, where the electrical current is
the rate of flow of charge. We also examine a characteristic of materials known as the resistance. Resistance is a
measure of how much a material impedes the flow of charge, and it will be shown that the resistance depends on
temperature. In general, a good conductor, such as copper, gold, or silver, has very low resistance. Some materials,
called superconductors, have zero resistance at very low temperatures.
High currents are required for the operation of electromagnets. Superconductors can be used to make
electromagnets that are 10 times stronger than the strongest conventional electromagnets. These superconducting
magnets are used in the construction of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices that can be used to make high-
resolution images of the human body. The chapter-opening picture shows an MRI image of the vertebrae of a human
subject and the MRI device itself. Superconducting magnets have many other uses. For example, superconducting
magnets are used in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to curve the path of protons in the ring.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe an electrical current
         · Define the unit of electrical current
         · Explain the direction of current flow

     Up to now, we have considered primarily static charges. When charges did move, they were accelerated in response
     to an electrical field created by a voltage difference. The charges lost potential energy and gained kinetic energy as
     they traveled through a potential difference where the electrical field did work on the charge.

     Although charges do not require a material to flow through, the majority of this chapter deals with understanding the
     movement of charges through a material. The rate at which the charges flow past a location--that is, the amount of
     charge per unit time--is known as the electrical current. When charges flow through a medium, the current depends
     on the voltage applied, the material through which the charges flow, and the state of the material. Of particular
     interest is the motion of charges in a conducting wire. In previous chapters, charges were accelerated due to the
     force provided by an electrical field, losing potential energy and gaining kinetic energy. In this chapter, we discuss
     the situation of the force provided by an electrical field in a conductor, where charges lose kinetic energy to the
     material reaching a constant velocity, known as the "drift velocity." This is analogous to an object falling through the
     atmosphere and losing kinetic energy to the air, reaching a constant terminal velocity.

     If you have ever taken a course in first aid or safety, you may have heard that in the event of electric shock, it is the
     current, not the voltage, which is the important factor on the severity of the shock and the amount of damage to the
     human body. Current is measured in units called amperes; you may have noticed that circuit breakers in your home
     and fuses in your car are rated in amps (or amperes). But what is the ampere and what does it measure?

     Defining Current and the Ampere

     Electrical current is defined to be the rate at which charge flows. When there is a large current present, such as that
     used to run a refrigerator, a large amount of charge moves through the wire in a small amount of time. If the current
     is small, such as that used to operate a handheld calculator, a small amount of charge moves through the circuit
     over a long period of time.

       ELECTRICAL CURRENT

       The average electrical current I is the rate at which charge flows,

                                                                                                                                                         9.1

     where is the amount of net charge passing through a given cross-sectional area in time (Figure 9.2). The
     SI unit for current is the ampere (A), named for the French physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775-1836). Since

                , we see that an ampere is defined as one coulomb of charge passing through a given area per second:

                                                                                                                                                      9.2

     The instantaneous electrical current, or simply the electrical current, is the time derivative of the charge that

     flows and is found by taking the limit of the average electrical current as  :

                                                                                     9.3

     Most electrical appliances are rated in amperes (or amps) required for proper operation, as are fuses and circuit
     breakers.

EXAMPLE 9.1

Calculating the Average Current

The main purpose of a battery in a car or truck is to run the electric starter motor, which starts the engine. The
operation of starting the vehicle requires a large current to be supplied by the battery. Once the engine starts, a
device called an alternator takes over supplying the electric power required for running the vehicle and for charging
the battery.

(a) What is the average current involved when a truck battery sets in motion 720 C of charge in 4.00 s while starting
an engine? (b) How long does it take 1.00 C of charge to flow from the battery?

Strategy

We can use the definition of the average current in the equation  to find the average current in part (a), since

charge and time are given. For part (b), once we know the average current, we can its definition  to find the
time required for 1.00 C of charge to flow from the battery.

Solution
a. Entering the given values for charge and time into the definition of current gives

b. Solving the relationship   for time and entering the known values for charge and current gives

Significance
a. This large value for current illustrates the fact that a large charge is moved in a small amount of time. The currents
in these "starter motors" are fairly large to overcome the inertia of the engine. b. A high current requires a short time
to supply a large amount of charge. This large current is needed to supply the large amount of energy needed to start
the engine.

     Strategy

     The current through the cross-section can be found from  . Notice from the figure that the charge increases

     to and the derivative decreases, approaching zero, as time increases (Figure 9.4).

     Solution

     The derivative can be found using  .

     Significance
     The current through the wire in question decreases exponentially, as shown in Figure 9.4. In later chapters, it will be
     shown that a time-dependent current appears when a capacitor charges or discharges through a resistor. Recall that
     a capacitor is a device that stores charge. You will learn about the resistor in Model of Conduction in Metals.

appliances?

Current in a Circuit

In the previous paragraphs, we defined the current as the charge that flows through a cross-sectional area per unit
time. In order for charge to flow through an appliance, such as the headlight shown in Figure 9.5, there must be a
complete path (or circuit) from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. Consider a simple circuit of a car
battery, a switch, a headlight lamp, and wires that provide a current path between the components. In order for the
lamp to light, there must be a complete path for current flow. In other words, a charge must be able to leave the
positive terminal of the battery, travel through the component, and back to the negative terminal of the battery. The
switch is there to control the circuit. Part (a) of the figure shows the simple circuit of a car battery, a switch, a
conducting path, and a headlight lamp. Also shown is the schematic of the circuit [part (b)]. A schematic is a
graphical representation of a circuit and is very useful in visualizing the main features of a circuit. Schematics use
standardized symbols to represent the components in a circuits and solid lines to represent the wires connecting
the components. The battery is shown as a series of long and short lines, representing the historic voltaic pile. The
lamp is shown as a circle with a loop inside, representing the filament of an incandescent bulb. The switch is shown
as two points with a conducting bar to connect the two points and the wires connecting the components are shown
as solid lines. The schematic in part (c) shows the direction of current flow when the switch is closed.

FIGURE 9.5 (a) A simple electric circuit of a headlight (lamp), a battery, and a switch. When the switch is closed, an uninterrupted path for
current to flow through is supplied by conducting wires connecting a load to the terminals of a battery. (b) In this schematic, the battery is
represented by parallel lines, which resemble plates in the original design of a battery. The longer lines indicate the positive terminal. The
conducting wires are shown as solid lines. The switch is shown, in the open position, as two terminals with a line representing a conducting
bar that can make contact between the two terminals. The lamp is represented by a circle encompassing a filament, as would be seen in an
incandescent light bulb. (c) When the switch is closed, the circuit is complete and current flows from the positive terminal to the negative
terminal of the battery.

When the switch is closed in Figure 9.5(c), there is a complete path for charges to flow, from the positive terminal of
the battery, through the switch, then through the headlight and back to the negative terminal of the battery. Note
that the direction of current flow is from positive to negative. The direction of conventional current is always
represented in the direction that positive charge would flow, from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.

The conventional current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, but depending on the actual
situation, positive charges, negative charges, or both may move. In metal wires, for example, current is carried by
electrons--that is, negative charges move. In ionic solutions, such as salt water, both positive and negative charges
move. This is also true in nerve cells. A Van de Graaff generator, used for nuclear research, can produce a current of
pure positive charges, such as protons. In the Tevatron Accelerator at Fermilab, before it was shut down in 2011,
beams of protons and antiprotons traveling in opposite directions were collided. The protons are positive and
therefore their current is in the same direction as they travel. The antiprotons are negativity charged and thus their
current is in the opposite direction that the actual particles travel.
366  9 · Current and Resistance

     A closer look at the current flowing through a wire is shown in Figure 9.6. The figure illustrates the movement of
     charged particles that compose a current. The fact that conventional current is taken to be in the direction that
     positive charge would flow can be traced back to American scientist and statesman Benjamin Franklin in the 1700s.
     Having no knowledge of the particles that make up the atom (namely the proton, electron, and neutron), Franklin
     believed that electrical current flowed from a material that had more of an "electrical fluid" and to a material that
     had less of this "electrical fluid." He coined the term positive for the material that had more of this electrical fluid
     and negative for the material that lacked the electrical fluid. He surmised that current would flow from the material
     with more electrical fluid--the positive material--to the negative material, which has less electrical fluid. Franklin
     called this direction of current a positive current flow. This was pretty advanced thinking for a man who knew
     nothing about the atom.

     FIGURE 9.6 Current I is the rate at which charge moves through an area A, such as the cross-section of a wire. Conventional current is
     defined to move in the direction of the electrical field. (a) Positive charges move in the direction of the electrical field, which is the same
     direction as conventional current. (b) Negative charges move in the direction opposite to the electrical field. Conventional current is in the
     direction opposite to the movement of negative charge. The flow of electrons is sometimes referred to as electronic flow.

     We now know that a material is positive if it has a greater number of protons than electrons, and it is negative if it
     has a greater number of electrons than protons. In a conducting metal, the current flow is due primarily to electrons
     flowing from the negative material to the positive material, but for historical reasons, we consider the positive
     current flow and the current is shown to flow from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal.

     It is important to realize that an electrical field is present in conductors and is responsible for producing the current
     (Figure 9.6). In previous chapters, we considered the static electrical case, where charges in a conductor quickly
     redistribute themselves on the surface of the conductor in order to cancel out the external electrical field and
     restore equilibrium. In the case of an electrical circuit, the charges are prevented from ever reaching equilibrium by
     an external source of electric potential, such as a battery. The energy needed to move the charge is supplied by the
     electric potential from the battery.

     Although the electrical field is responsible for the motion of the charges in the conductor, the work done on the
     charges by the electrical field does not increase the kinetic energy of the charges. We will show that the electrical
     field is responsible for keeping the electric charges moving at a "drift velocity."

     9.2 Model of Conduction in Metals

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define the drift velocity of charges moving through a metal
         · Define the vector current density
         · Describe the operation of an incandescent lamp

     When electrons move through a conducting wire, they do not move at a constant velocity, that is, the electrons do
     not move in a straight line at a constant speed. Rather, they interact with and collide with atoms and other free
     electrons in the conductor. Thus, the electrons move in a zig-zag fashion and drift through the wire. We should also
     note that even though it is convenient to discuss the direction of current, current is a scalar quantity. When
     discussing the velocity of charges in a current, it is more appropriate to discuss the current density. We will come
     back to this idea at the end of this section.

Drift Velocity

Electrical signals move very rapidly. Telephone conversations carried by currents in wires cover large distances

without noticeable delays. Lights come on as soon as a light switch is moved to the `on' position. Most electrical

signals carried by currents travel at speeds on the order of  , a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Interestingly, the individual charges that make up the current move much slower on average, typically drifting at

speeds on the order of  . How do we reconcile these two speeds, and what does it tell us about standard

conductors?

The high speed of electrical signals results from the fact that the electrons behave as an incompressible fluid. Thus,
when a free charge is forced into a wire, as in Figure 9.7, another leaves almost immediately, carrying the signal
rapidly forward. The signal is passed on rapidly as an electrical shock wave moving through the system at nearly the
speed of light. To be precise, this fast-moving signal, or shock wave, is a rapidly propagating change in the electrical
field due to equally rapid adjustments of surface charge.

FIGURE 9.7 When charged particles are forced into this volume of a conductor, an equal number are quickly forced to leave. The repulsion
between like charges makes it difficult to increase the number of charges in a volume. Thus, as one charge enters, another leaves almost
immediately, carrying the signal rapidly forward.

Good conductors have large numbers of free charges. In metals, the free charges are free electrons. (In fact, good
electrical conductors are often good heat conductors too, because large numbers of free electrons can transport
thermal energy as well as carry electrical current.) Figure 9.8 shows how free electrons move through an ordinary
conductor. The distance that an individual electron can move between collisions with atoms or other electrons is
quite small. The electron paths thus appear nearly random, like the motion of atoms in a gas. But there is an
electrical field in the conductor that causes the electrons to drift in the direction shown (opposite to the field, since
they are negative). The drift velocity is the average velocity of the free charges. Drift velocity is quite small, since
there are so many free charges. If we have an estimate of the density of free electrons in a conductor, we can
calculate the drift velocity for a given current. The larger the density, the lower the velocity required for a given
current.

FIGURE 9.8 Free electrons moving in a conductor make many collisions with other electrons and other particles. A typical path of one
electron is shown. The average velocity of the free charges is called the drift velocity and for electrons, it is in the direction opposite to
the electrical field. The collisions normally transfer energy to the conductor, requiring a constant supply of energy to maintain a steady
current.

Free-electron collisions transfer energy to the atoms of the conductor. The electrical field does work in moving the
electrons through a distance, but that work does not increase the kinetic energy (nor speed) of the electrons. The
work is transferred to the conductor's atoms, often increasing temperature. Thus, a continuous power input is
required to keep a current flowing. (An exception is superconductors, for reasons we shall explore in a later chapter.
Superconductors can have a steady current without a continual supply of energy--a great energy savings.) For a
conductor that is not a superconductor, the supply of energy can be useful, as in an incandescent light bulb filament
(Figure 9.9). The supply of energy is necessary to increase the temperature of the tungsten filament, so that the
filament glows.
368  9 · Current and Resistance

     FIGURE 9.9 The incandescent lamp is a simple design. A tungsten filament is placed in a partially evacuated glass envelope. One end of the
     filament is attached to the screw base, which is made out of a conducting material. The second end of the filament is attached to a second
     contact in the base of the bulb. The two contacts are separated by an insulating material. Current flows through the filament, and the
     temperature of the filament becomes large enough to cause the filament to glow and produce light. However, these bulbs are not very
     energy efficient, as evident from the heat coming from the bulb. In the year 2012, the United States, along with many other countries,
     began to phase out incandescent lamps in favor of more energy-efficient lamps, such as light-emitting diode (LED) lamps and compact
     fluorescent lamps (CFL) (credit right: modification of work by Serge Saint).

     We can obtain an expression for the relationship between current and drift velocity by considering the number of
     free charges in a segment of wire, as illustrated in Figure 9.10. The number of free charges per unit volume, or the

     number density of free charges, is given the symbol n where  . The value of n depends on the

     material. The shaded segment has a volume  , so that the number of free charges in the volume is                .

     The charge dQ in this segment is thus      , where q is the amount of charge on each carrier. (The magnitude of

     the charge of electrons is                 .) Current is charge moved per unit time; thus, if all the original

     charges move out of this segment in time dt, the current is

     Rearranging terms gives
                                                                                                                                                            9.4

     where is the drift velocity, n is the free charge density, A is the cross-sectional area of the wire, and I is the
     current through the wire. The carriers of the current each have charge q and move with a drift velocity of magnitude

        .

               FIGURE 9.10 All the charges in the shaded volume of this wire move out in a time dt, having a drift velocity of magnitude .

     Note that simple drift velocity is not the entire story. The speed of an electron is sometimes much greater than its
     drift velocity. In addition, not all of the electrons in a conductor can move freely, and those that do move might move
     somewhat faster or slower than the drift velocity. So what do we mean by free electrons?
     Atoms in a metallic conductor are packed in the form of a lattice structure. Some electrons are far enough away

from the atomic nuclei that they do not experience the attraction of the nuclei as strongly as the inner electrons do.
These are the free electrons. They are not bound to a single atom but can instead move freely among the atoms in a
"sea" of electrons. When an electrical field is applied, these free electrons respond by accelerating. As they move,
they collide with the atoms in the lattice and with other electrons, generating thermal energy, and the conductor
gets warmer. In an insulator, the organization of the atoms and the structure do not allow for such free electrons.

As you know, electric power is usually supplied to equipment and appliances through round wires made of a
conducting material (copper, aluminum, silver, or gold) that are stranded or solid. The diameter of the wire
determines the current-carrying capacity--the larger the diameter, the greater the current-carrying capacity. Even
though the current-carrying capacity is determined by the diameter, wire is not normally characterized by the
diameter directly. Instead, wire is commonly sold in a unit known as "gauge." Wires are manufactured by passing
the material through circular forms called "drawing dies." In order to make thinner wires, manufacturers draw the
wires through multiple dies of successively thinner diameter. Historically, the gauge of the wire was related to the
number of drawing processes required to manufacture the wire. For this reason, the larger the gauge, the smaller
the diameter. In the United States, the American Wire Gauge (AWG) was developed to standardize the system.
Household wiring commonly consists of 10-gauge (2.588-mm diameter) to 14-gauge (1.628-mm diameter) wire. A
device used to measure the gauge of wire is shown in Figure 9.11.

EXAMPLE 9.3

Calculating Drift Velocity in a Common Wire

Calculate the drift velocity of electrons in a copper wire with a diameter of 2.053 mm (12-gauge) carrying a 20.0-A
current, given that there is one free electron per copper atom. (Household wiring often contains 12-gauge copper
wire, and the maximum current allowed in such wire is usually 20.0 A.) The density of copper is
and the atomic mass of copper is 63.54 g/mol.

Strategy

We can calculate the drift velocity using the equation  . The current is          and

          is the charge of an electron. We can calculate the area of a cross-section of the wire using the

formula   , where r is one-half the diameter. The given diameter is 2.053 mm, so r is 1.0265 mm. We are

given the density of copper,                  , and the atomic mass of copper is  . We can use these

two quantities along with Avogadro's number,            , to determine n, the number of free
electrons per cubic meter.

     Solution
     First, we calculate the density of free electrons in copper. There is one free electron per copper atom. Therefore, the
     number of free electrons is the same as the number of copper atoms per . We can now find n as follows:

     The cross-sectional area of the wire is

     Rearranging                 to isolate drift velocity gives

     Significance

     The minus sign indicates that the negative charges are moving in the direction opposite to conventional current. The

     small value for drift velocity (on the order of              confirms that the signal moves on the order of  times

     faster (about    than the charges that carry it.

     In Example 9.4, the drift velocity was calculated for a 2.053-mm diameter (12-gauge) copper wire carrying a
     20-amp current. Would the drift velocity change for a 1.628-mm diameter (14-gauge) wire carrying the same
     20-amp current?

     Current Density

     Although it is often convenient to attach a negative or positive sign to indicate the overall direction of motion of the

     charges, current is a scalar quantity,           . It is often necessary to discuss the details of the motion of the charge,

     instead of discussing the overall motion of the charges. In such cases, it is necessary to discuss the current density,

      , a vector quantity. The current density is the flow of charge through an infinitesimal area, divided by the area. The
     current density must take into account the local magnitude and direction of the charge flow, which varies from point
     to point. The unit of current density is ampere per meter squared, and the direction is defined as the direction of net
     flow of positive charges through the area.

     The relationship between the current and the current density can be seen in Figure 9.12. The differential current
     flow through the area is found as

     where is the angle between the area and the current density. The total current passing through area          can be
     found by integrating over the area,

                                                                                                                  9.5

     Consider the magnitude of the current density, which is the current divided by the area:

Thus, the current density is  . If q is positive, is in the same direction as the electrical field . If q is

negative, is in the opposite direction of . Either way, the direction of the current density is in the direction of

the electrical field .

FIGURE 9.12 The current density is defined as the current passing through an infinitesimal cross-sectional area divided by the area. The
direction of the current density is the direction of the net flow of positive charges and the magnitude is equal to the current divided by the
infinitesimal area.

The current density in a conducting wire depends on the current through the conducting wire and the cross-
sectional area of the wire. For a given current, as the diameter of the wire increases, the charge density decreases.

The current density is proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the area. If the current density in a
conducting wire increases, what would happen to the drift velocity of the charges in the wire?

What is the significance of the current density? The current density is proportional to the current, and the current is
the number of charges that pass through a cross-sectional area per second. The charges move through the
conductor, accelerated by the electric force provided by the electrical field. The electrical field is created when a
voltage is applied across the conductor. In Ohm's Law, we will use this relationship between the current density and
the electrical field to examine the relationship between the current through a conductor and the voltage applied.

9.3 Resistivity and Resistance

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Differentiate between resistance and resistivity
    · Define the term conductivity
    · Describe the electrical component known as a resistor
    · State the relationship between resistance of a resistor and its length, cross-sectional area, and resistivity
    · State the relationship between resistivity and temperature
372  9 · Current and Resistance

     What drives current? We can think of various devices--such as batteries, generators, wall outlets, and so on--that
     are necessary to maintain a current. All such devices create a potential difference and are referred to as voltage
     sources. When a voltage source is connected to a conductor, it applies a potential difference V that creates an
     electrical field. The electrical field, in turn, exerts force on free charges, causing current. The amount of current
     depends not only on the magnitude of the voltage, but also on the characteristics of the material that the current is
     flowing through. The material can resist the flow of the charges, and the measure of how much a material resists the
     flow of charges is known as the resistivity. This resistivity is crudely analogous to the friction between two materials
     that resists motion.

     Resistivity

     When a voltage is applied to a conductor, an electrical field is created, and charges in the conductor feel a force
     due to the electrical field. The current density that results depends on the electrical field and the properties of the
     material. This dependence can be very complex. In some materials, including metals at a given temperature, the
     current density is approximately proportional to the electrical field. In these cases, the current density can be
     modeled as

     where is the electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity is analogous to thermal conductivity and is a

     measure of a material's ability to conduct or transmit electricity. Conductors have a higher electrical conductivity

     than insulators. Since the electrical conductivity is  , the units are

     Here, we define a unit named the ohm with the Greek symbol uppercase omega, . The unit is named after Georg

     Simon Ohm, whom we will discuss later in this chapter. The is used to avoid confusion with the number 0. One

     ohm equals one volt per amp:     . The units of electrical conductivity are therefore  .

     Conductivity is an intrinsic property of a material. Another intrinsic property of a material is the resistivity, or
     electrical resistivity. The resistivity of a material is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of
     electrical current. The symbol for resistivity is the lowercase Greek letter rho, , and resistivity is the reciprocal of
     electrical conductivity:

     The unit of resistivity in SI units is the ohm-meter   . We can define the resistivity in terms of the electrical
     field and the current density,                                                                                                9.6

     The greater the resistivity, the larger the field needed to produce a given current density. The lower the resistivity,
     the larger the current density produced by a given electrical field. Good conductors have a high conductivity and low
     resistivity. Good insulators have a low conductivity and a high resistivity. Table 9.1 lists resistivity and conductivity
     values for various materials.

     The materials listed in the table are separated into categories of conductors, semiconductors, and insulators, based
     on broad groupings of resistivity. Conductors have the smallest resistivity, and insulators have the largest;
     semiconductors have intermediate resistivity. Conductors have varying but large, free charge densities, whereas
     most charges in insulators are bound to atoms and are not free to move. Semiconductors are intermediate, having
     far fewer free charges than conductors, but having properties that make the number of free charges depend strongly
     on the type and amount of impurities in the semiconductor. These unique properties of semiconductors are put to
     use in modern electronics, as we will explore in later chapters.

     Copper wires are routinely used for extension cords and house wiring for several reasons. Copper has the highest

     electrical conductivity rating, and therefore the lowest resistivity rating, of all nonprecious metals. Also important is

     the tensile strength, where the tensile strength is a measure of the force required to pull an object to the point

     where it breaks. The tensile strength of a material is the maximum amount of tensile stress it can take before

     breaking. Copper has a high tensile strength,   . A third important characteristic is ductility. Ductility is a

     measure of a material's ability to be drawn into wires and a measure of the flexibility of the material, and copper has
     a high ductility. Summarizing, for a conductor to be a suitable candidate for making wire, there are at least three
     important characteristics: low resistivity, high tensile strength, and high ductility. What other materials are used for
     wiring and what are the advantages and disadvantages?

     Temperature Dependence of Resistivity

     Looking back at Table 9.1, you will see a column labeled "Temperature Coefficient." The resistivity of some
     materials has a strong temperature dependence. In some materials, such as copper, the resistivity increases with
     increasing temperature. In fact, in most conducting metals, the resistivity increases with increasing temperature.
     The increasing temperature causes increased vibrations of the atoms in the lattice structure of the metals, which
     impede the motion of the electrons. In other materials, such as carbon, the resistivity decreases with increasing
     temperature. In many materials, the dependence is approximately linear and can be modeled using a linear
     equation:

where is the resistivity of the material at temperature T, is the temperature coefficient of the material, and is

the resistivity at , usually taken as             .

Note also that the temperature coefficient is negative for the semiconductors listed in Table 9.1, meaning that
their resistivity decreases with increasing temperature. They become better conductors at higher temperature,
because increased thermal agitation increases the number of free charges available to carry current. This property
of decreasing with temperature is also related to the type and amount of impurities present in the
semiconductors.

Resistance

We now consider the resistance of a wire or component. The resistance is a measure of how difficult it is to pass
current through a wire or component. Resistance depends on the resistivity. The resistivity is a characteristic of the
material used to fabricate a wire or other electrical component, whereas the resistance is a characteristic of the wire
or component.

To calculate the resistance, consider a section of conducting wire with cross-sectional area A, length L, and
resistivity A battery is connected across the conductor, providing a potential difference across it (Figure
9.13). The potential difference produces an electrical field that is proportional to the current density, according to

          .

FIGURE 9.13 A potential provided by a battery is applied to a segment of a conductor with a cross-sectional area A and a length L.

The magnitude of the electrical field across the segment of the conductor is equal to the voltage divided by the

length,       , and the magnitude of the current density is equal to the current divided by the cross-sectional
area,       As with capacitance, we use V to represent the potential difference V across the resistor. Using this

information and recalling that the electrical field is proportional to the resistivity and the current density, we can see

that the voltage is proportional to the current:

RESISTANCE

The ratio of the voltage to the current is defined as the resistance R:
                                                                                                                                                 9.8

The resistance of a cylindrical segment of a conductor is equal to the resistivity of the material times the length
divided by the area:

     The unit of resistance is the ohm, . For a given voltage, the higher the resistance, the lower the current.

     Resistors
     A common component in electronic circuits is the resistor. The resistor can be used to reduce current flow or
     provide a voltage drop. Figure 9.14 shows the symbols used for a resistor in schematic diagrams of a circuit. Two
     commonly used standards for circuit diagrams are provided by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI,
     pronounced "AN-see") and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Both systems are commonly used.
     We use the ANSI standard in this text for its visual recognition, but we note that for larger, more complex circuits,
     the IEC standard may have a cleaner presentation, making it easier to read.

     FIGURE 9.14 Symbols for a resistor used in circuit diagrams. (a) The ANSI symbol; (b) the IEC symbol.

     Material and shape dependence of resistance

     A resistor can be modeled as a cylinder with a cross-sectional area A and a length L, made of a material with a

     resistivity (Figure 9.15). The resistance of the resistor is  .

     FIGURE 9.15 A model of a resistor as a uniform cylinder of length L and cross-sectional area A. Its resistance to the flow of current is
     analogous to the resistance posed by a pipe to fluid flow. The longer the cylinder, the greater its resistance. The larger its cross-sectional
     area A, the smaller its resistance.

     The most common material used to make a resistor is carbon. A carbon track is wrapped around a ceramic core, and
     two copper leads are attached. A second type of resistor is the metal film resistor, which also has a ceramic core.
     The track is made from a metal oxide material, which has semiconductive properties similar to carbon. Again,
     copper leads are inserted into the ends of the resistor. The resistor is then painted and marked for identification. A
     resistor has four colored bands, as shown in Figure 9.16.

represent the first two digits of the resistance of the resistor. The third color is the multiplier. The fourth color represents the tolerance of

the resistor. The resistor shown has a resistance of     .

Resistances range over many orders of magnitude. Some ceramic insulators, such as those used to support power

lines, have resistances of  or more. A dry person may have a hand-to-foot resistance of                           , whereas the

resistance of the human heart is about                . A meter-long piece of large-diameter copper wire may have a

resistance of  , and superconductors have no resistance at all at low temperatures. As we have seen,

resistance is related to the shape of an object and the material of which it is composed.

     common thermometers is based on the thermistor, a semiconductor crystal with a strong temperature dependence,
     the resistance of which is measured to obtain its temperature. The device is small, so that it quickly comes into
     thermal equilibrium with the part of a person it touches.

Notice that the resistance changes by more than a factor of 10 as the filament warms to the high temperature and
the current through the filament depends on the resistance of the filament and the voltage applied. If the filament is

The Resistance of Coaxial Cable

Long cables can sometimes act like antennas, picking up electronic noise, which are signals from other equipment
and appliances. Coaxial cables are used for many applications that require this noise to be eliminated. For example,
they can be found in the home in cable TV connections or other audiovisual connections. Coaxial cables consist of
an inner conductor of radius surrounded by a second, outer concentric conductor with radius (Figure 9.18). The
space between the two is normally filled with an insulator such as polyethylene plastic. A small amount of radial
leakage current occurs between the two conductors. Determine the resistance of a coaxial cable of length L.

     The resistance of a coaxial cable depends on its length, the inner and outer radii, and the resistivity of the material
     separating the two conductors. Since this resistance is not infinite, a small leakage current occurs between the two
     conductors. This leakage current leads to the attenuation (or weakening) of the signal being sent through the cable.

We have been discussing three electrical properties so far in this chapter: current, voltage, and resistance. It turns
out that many materials exhibit a simple relationship among the values for these properties, known as Ohm's law.
Many other materials do not show this relationship, so despite being called Ohm's law, it is not considered a law of
nature, like Newton's laws or the laws of thermodynamics. But it is very useful for calculations involving materials
that do obey Ohm's law.

Description of Ohm's Law

The current that flows through most substances is directly proportional to the voltage V applied to it. The German
physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787-1854) was the first to demonstrate experimentally that the current in a metal
wire is directly proportional to the voltage applied:

This important relationship is the basis for Ohm's law. It can be viewed as a cause-and-effect relationship, with
voltage the cause and current the effect. This is an empirical law, which is to say that it is an experimentally
observed phenomenon, like friction. Such a linear relationship doesn't always occur. Any material, component, or
device that obeys Ohm's law, where the current through the device is proportional to the voltage applied, is known
as an ohmic material or ohmic component. Any material or component that does not obey Ohm's law is known as a
nonohmic material or nonohmic component.

Ohm's Experiment

In a paper published in 1827, Georg Ohm described an experiment in which he measured voltage across and
current through various simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire. A similar experiment is shown in
Figure 9.19. This experiment is used to observe the current through a resistor that results from an applied voltage.
In this simple circuit, a resistor is connected in series with a battery. The voltage is measured with a voltmeter,
which must be placed across the resistor (in parallel with the resistor). The current is measured with an ammeter,
which must be in line with the resistor (in series with the resistor).

FIGURE 9.19 The experimental set-up used to determine if a resistor is an ohmic or nonohmic device. (a) When the battery is attached, the
current flows in the clockwise direction and the voltmeter and ammeter have positive readings. (b) When the leads of the battery are
switched, the current flows in the counterclockwise direction and the voltmeter and ammeter have negative readings.

In this updated version of Ohm's original experiment, several measurements of the current were made for several
different voltages. When the battery was hooked up as in Figure 9.19(a), the current flowed in the clockwise
direction and the readings of the voltmeter and ammeter were positive. Does the behavior of the current change if
the current flowed in the opposite direction? To get the current to flow in the opposite direction, the leads of the
battery can be switched. When the leads of the battery were switched, the readings of the voltmeter and ammeter
readings were negative because the current flowed in the opposite direction, in this case, counterclockwise. Results
of a similar experiment are shown in Figure 9.20.

     increments. A plot shows values of the voltage versus the current typical of what a casual experimenter might find.

     In this experiment, the voltage applied across the resistor varies from -10.00 to +10.00 V, by increments of 1.00 V.
     The current through the resistor and the voltage across the resistor are measured. A plot is made of the voltage
     versus the current, and the result is approximately linear. The slope of the line is the resistance, or the voltage
     divided by the current. This result is known as Ohm's law:

                                                                                                                                                          9.11

     where V is the voltage measured in volts across the object in question, I is the current measured through the object
     in amps, and R is the resistance in units of ohms. As stated previously, any device that shows a linear relationship
     between the voltage and the current is known as an ohmic device. A resistor is therefore an ohmic device.

     resistor is 3.00 mA. (a) What is the resistance of the resistor measured in ohms? (b) If the temperature of the

     resistor is increased to         by heating the resistor, what is the current through the resistor?

     Strategy

     (a) The resistance can be found using Ohm's law. Ohm's law states that  , so the resistance can be found

     using        .

     (b) First, the resistance is temperature dependent so the new resistance after the resistor has been heated can be

     found using                      . The current can be found using Ohm's law in the form              .

Nonohmic devices do not exhibit a linear relationship between the voltage and the current. One such device is the
semiconducting circuit element known as a diode. A diode is a circuit device that allows current flow in only one
direction. A diagram of a simple circuit consisting of a battery, a diode, and a resistor is shown in Figure 9.21.
Although we do not cover the theory of the diode in this section, the diode can be tested to see if it is an ohmic or a
nonohmic device.

FIGURE 9.21 A diode is a semiconducting device that allows current flow only if the diode is forward biased, which means that the anode is
positive and the cathode is negative.

A plot of current versus voltage is shown in Figure 9.22. Note that the behavior of the diode is shown as current
versus voltage, whereas the resistor operation was shown as voltage versus current. A diode consists of an anode
and a cathode. When the anode is at a negative potential and the cathode is at a positive potential, as shown in part
(a), the diode is said to have reverse bias. With reverse bias, the diode has an extremely large resistance and there is
very little current flow--essentially zero current--through the diode and the resistor. As the voltage applied to the
circuit increases, the current remains essentially zero, until the voltage reaches the breakdown voltage and the
diode conducts current, as shown in Figure 9.22. When the battery and the potential across the diode are reversed,
making the anode positive and the cathode negative, the diode conducts and current flows through the diode if the
voltage is greater than 0.7 V. The resistance of the diode is close to zero. (This is the reason for the resistor in the
circuit; if it were not there, the current would become very large.) You can see from the graph in Figure 9.22 that the
384  9 · Current and Resistance

     voltage and the current do not have a linear relationship. Thus, the diode is an example of a nonohmic device.

     FIGURE 9.22 When the voltage across the diode is negative and small, there is very little current flow through the diode. As the voltage
     reaches the breakdown voltage, the diode conducts. When the voltage across the diode is positive and greater than 0.7 V (the actual
     voltage value depends on the diode), the diode conducts. As the voltage applied increases, the current through the diode increases, but the
     voltage across the diode remains approximately 0.7 V.

     Ohm's law is commonly stated as  , but originally it was stated as a microscopic view, in terms of the current

     density, the conductivity, and the electrical field. This microscopic view suggests the proportionality  comes

     from the drift velocity of the free electrons in the metal that results from an applied electrical field. As stated earlier,

     the current density is proportional to the applied electrical field. The reformulation of Ohm's law is credited to

     Gustav Kirchhoff, whose name we will see again in the next chapter.

     9.5 Electrical Energy and Power

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Express electrical power in terms of the voltage and the current
         · Describe the power dissipated by a resistor in an electric circuit
         · Calculate the energy efficiency and cost effectiveness of appliances and equipment

     In an electric circuit, electrical energy is continuously converted into other forms of energy. For example, when a
     current flows in a conductor, electrical energy is converted into thermal energy within the conductor. The electrical
     field, supplied by the voltage source, accelerates the free electrons, increasing their kinetic energy for a short time.
     This increased kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy through collisions with the ions of the lattice
     structure of the conductor. In Work and Kinetic Energy (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/
     pages/7-introduction), we defined power as the rate at which work is done by a force measured in watts. Power can
     also be defined as the rate at which energy is transferred. In this section, we discuss the time rate of energy transfer,
     or power, in an electric circuit.

     Power in Electric Circuits

     Power is associated by many people with electricity. Power transmission lines might come to mind. We also think of
     light bulbs in terms of their power ratings in watts. What is the expression for electric power?

     Let us compare a 25-W bulb with a 60-W bulb (Figure 9.23(a)). The 60-W bulb glows brighter than the 25-W bulb.
     Although it is not shown, a 60-W light bulb is also warmer than the 25-W bulb. The heat and light is produced from
     the conversion of electrical energy. The kinetic energy lost by the electrons in collisions is converted into the internal
     energy of the conductor and radiation. How are voltage, current, and resistance related to electric power?

fluorescent light (CFL) bulb puts out the same intensity of light as the 60-W bulb, but at 1/4 to 1/10 the input power. (credit a: modification

To calculate electric power, consider a voltage difference existing across a material (Figure 9.24). The electric

potential is higher than the electric potential at , and the voltage difference is                    . As discussed in

Electric Potential, an electrical field exists between the two potentials, which points from the higher potential to the

lower potential. Recall that the electrical potential is defined as the potential energy per charge,        , and the

charge loses potential energy moving through the potential difference.

FIGURE 9.24 When there is a potential difference across a conductor, an electrical field is present that points in the direction from the
higher potential to the lower potential.

If the charge is positive, the charge experiences a force due to the electrical field                 . This force is

necessary to keep the charge moving. This force does not act to accelerate the charge through the entire distance

because of the interactions of the charge with atoms and free electrons in the material. The speed, and

therefore the kinetic energy, of the charge do not increase during the entire trip across , and charge passing

through area has the same drift velocity as the charge that passes through area . However, work is done on

the charge, by the electrical field, which changes the potential energy. Since the change in the electrical potential

difference is negative, the electrical field is found to be

The work done on the charge is equal to the electric force times the length at which the force is applied,

The charge moves at a drift velocity so the work done on the charge results in a loss of potential energy, but the
average kinetic energy remains constant. The lost electrical potential energy appears as thermal energy in the
386  9 · Current and Resistance

     material. On a microscopic scale, the energy transfer is due to collisions between the charge and the molecules of
     the material, which leads to an increase in temperature in the material. The loss of potential energy results in an
     increase in the temperature of the material, which is dissipated as radiation. In a resistor, it is dissipated as heat,
     and in a light bulb, it is dissipated as heat and light.

     The power dissipated by the material as heat and light is equal to the time rate of change of the work:

     With a resistor, the voltage drop across the resistor is dissipated as heat. Ohm's law states that the voltage across

     the resistor is equal to the current times the resistance,    . The power dissipated by the resistor is therefore

     If a resistor is connected to a battery, the power dissipated as radiant energy by the wires and the resistor is equal

     to                          . The power supplied from the battery is equal to current times the voltage,     .

     The electric power gained or lost by any device has the form

     The power dissipated by a resistor has the form

     Different insights can be gained from the three different expressions for electric power. For example,

     implies that the lower the resistance connected to a given voltage source, the greater the power delivered.

     Furthermore, since voltage is squared in  , the effect of applying a higher voltage is perhaps greater than

     expected. Thus, when the voltage is doubled to a 25-W bulb, its power nearly quadruples to about 100 W, burning it

     out. If the bulb's resistance remained constant, its power would be exactly 100 W, but at the higher temperature, its

     resistance is higher, too.

         EXAMPLE 9.9

     Calculating Power in Electric Devices

     A DC winch motor is rated at 20.00 A with a voltage of 115 V. When the motor is running at its maximum power, it
     can lift an object with a weight of 4900.00 N a distance of 10.00 m, in 30.00 s, at a constant speed. (a) What is the
     power consumed by the motor? (b) What is the power used in lifting the object? Ignore air resistance. (c) Assuming
     that the difference in the power consumed by the motor and the power used lifting the object are dissipated as heat
     by the resistance of the motor, estimate the resistance of the motor?

     Strategy

     (a) The power consumed by the motor can be found using        . (b) The power used in lifting the object at a

     constant speed can be found using         , where the speed is the distance divided by the time. The upward force

     supplied by the motor is equal to the weight of the object because the acceleration is zero. (c) The resistance of the

     motor can be found using           .

     Solution

         a. The power consumed by the motor is equal to          and the current is given as 20.00 A and the voltage is
              115.00 V:

Significance
The resistance of the motor is quite small. The resistance of the motor is due to many windings of copper wire. The
power dissipated by the motor can be significant since the thermal power dissipated by the motor would be quite
large due to this small resistance; however, due to back emf, the current drawn by the motor is very small.

Electric motors have a reasonably high efficiency. A 100-hp motor can have an efficiency of 90% and a 1-hp motor
can have an efficiency of 80%. Why is it important to use high-performance motors?

A fuse (Figure 9.25) is a device that protects a circuit from currents that are too high. A fuse is basically a short piece
of wire between two contacts. As we have seen, when a current is running through a conductor, the kinetic energy of
the charge carriers is converted into thermal energy in the conductor. The piece of wire in the fuse is under tension
and has a low melting point. The wire is designed to heat up and break at the rated current. The fuse is destroyed
and must be replaced, but it protects the rest of the circuit. Fuses act quickly, but there is a small time delay while
the wire heats up and breaks.

FIGURE 9.25 A fuse consists of a piece of wire between two contacts. When a current passes through the wire that is greater than the rated
current, the wire melts, breaking the connection. Pictured is a "blown" fuse where the wire broke protecting a circuit (credit: modification of
work by "Shardayyy"/Flickr).

Circuit breakers are also rated for a maximum current, and open to protect the circuit, but can be reset. Circuit
breakers react much faster. The operation of circuit breakers is not within the scope of this chapter and will be
discussed in later chapters. Another method of protecting equipment and people is the ground fault circuit
interrupter (GFCI), which is common in bathrooms and kitchens. The GFCI outlets respond very quickly to changes
in current. These outlets open when there is a change in magnetic field produced by current-carrying conductors,
which is also beyond the scope of this chapter and is covered in a later chapter.

The Cost of Electricity

The more electric appliances you use and the longer they are left on, the higher your electric bill. This familiar fact is

based on the relationship between energy and power. You pay for the energy used. Since  , we see that

is the energy used by a device using power P for a time interval t. If power is delivered at a constant rate, then the
388  9 · Current and Resistance

     energy can be found by         . For example, the more light bulbs burning, the greater P used; the longer they are
     on, the greater t is.

     The energy unit on electric bills is the kilowatt-hour  , consistent with the relationship  . It is easy to

     estimate the cost of operating electrical appliances if you have some idea of their power consumption rate in watts

     or kilowatts, the time they are on in hours, and the cost per kilowatt-hour for your electric utility. Kilowatt-hours, like

     all other specialized energy units such as food calories, can be converted into joules. You can prove to yourself that

                                 .

     The electrical energy (E) used can be reduced either by reducing the time of use or by reducing the power
     consumption of that appliance or fixture. This not only reduces the cost but also results in a reduced impact on the
     environment. Improvements to lighting are some of the fastest ways to reduce the electrical energy used in a home
     or business. About 20% of a home's use of energy goes to lighting, and the number for commercial establishments
     is closer to 40%. Fluorescent lights are about four times more efficient than incandescent lights--this is true for both
     the long tubes and the compact fluorescent lights (CFLs). (See Figure 9.23(b).) Thus, a 60-W incandescent bulb can
     be replaced by a 15-W CFL, which has the same brightness and color. CFLs have a bent tube inside a globe or a
     spiral-shaped tube, all connected to a standard screw-in base that fits standard incandescent light sockets. (Original
     problems with color, flicker, shape, and high initial investment for CFLs have been addressed in recent years.)

     The heat transfer from these CFLs is less, and they last up to 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs. The
     significance of an investment in such bulbs is addressed in the next example. New white LEDs (which are clusters of
     small LEDs) are even more efficient (twice that of CFLs) and last five times longer than CFLs.

     EXAMPLE 9.10

     Calculating the Cost Effectiveness of LEDs

     The typical replacement for a 100-W incandescent bulb is a 20-W LED. The 20-W LED can provide the same amount
     of light output as the 100-W incandescent light bulb. What is the cost savings for using the LED in place of the
     incandescent bulb for one year, assuming $0.10 per kilowatt-hour is the average energy rate charged by the power
     company? Assume that the bulb is turned on for three hours a day.

     Strategy

     (a) Calculate the energy used during the year for each bulb, using  .

     (b) Multiply the energy by the cost.

     Solution

     a. Calculate the power for each bulb.

     b. Calculate the cost for each.

     Significance
     An LED uses 80% less energy than the incandescent bulb, saving $8.76 over the incandescent bulb for one year. The
     LED can cost $20.00 and the 100-W incandescent bulb can cost $0.75, which should be calculated into the
     computation. A typical lifespan of an incandescent bulb is 1200 hours and is 50,000 hours for the LED. The
     incandescent bulb would last 1.08 years at 3 hours a day and the LED would last 45.66 years. The initial cost of the
     LED is high, but the cost to the home owner will be $0.69 for the incandescent bulbs versus $0.44 for the LEDs per
     year. (Note that the LEDs are coming down in price.) The cost savings per year is approximately $8.50, and that is

Is the efficiency of the various light bulbs the only consideration when comparing the various light bulbs?

Changing light bulbs from incandescent bulbs to CFL or LEDs is a simple way to reduce energy consumption in
homes and commercial sites. CFL bulbs operate with a much different mechanism than do incandescent lights. The
mechanism is complex and beyond the scope of this chapter, but here is a very general description of the
mechanism. CFL bulbs contain argon and mercury vapor housed within a spiral-shaped tube. The CFL bulbs use a
"ballast" that increases the voltage used by the CFL bulb. The ballast produce an electrical current, which passes
through the gas mixture and excites the gas molecules. The excited gas molecules produce ultraviolet (UV) light,
which in turn stimulates the fluorescent coating on the inside of the tube. This coating fluoresces in the visible
spectrum, emitting visible light. Traditional fluorescent tubes and CFL bulbs had a short time delay of up to a few
seconds while the mixture was being "warmed up" and the molecules reached an excited state. It should be noted
that these bulbs do contain mercury, which is poisonous, but if the bulb is broken, the mercury is never released.
Even if the bulb is broken, the mercury tends to remain in the fluorescent coating. The amount is also quite small
and the advantage of the energy saving may outweigh the disadvantage of using mercury.

The CFL light bulbs are being replaced with LEDs, where LED stands for "light-emitting diode." The diode was briefly
discussed as a nonohmic device, made of semiconducting material, which essentially permits current flow in one
direction. LEDs are a special type of diode made of semiconducting materials infused with impurities in
combinations and concentrations that enable the extra energy from the movement of the electrons during electrical
excitation to be converted into visible light. Semiconducting devices will be explained in greater detail in Condensed
Matter Physics (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/9-introduction).

Commercial LEDs are quickly becoming the standard for commercial and residential lighting, replacing incandescent
and CFL bulbs. They are designed for the visible spectrum and are constructed from gallium doped with arsenic and
phosphorous atoms. The color emitted from an LED depends on the materials used in the semiconductor and the
current. In the early years of LED development, small LEDs found on circuit boards were red, green, and yellow, but
LEDs can now be programmed to produce millions of colors of light as well as many different hues of white light.

Comparison of Incandescent Light Bulbs, CFL Light Bulbs, and LEDs

The energy savings can be significant when replacing an incandescent light bulb or a CFL light bulb with an LED.
Light bulbs are rated by the amount of power that the bulb consumes, and the amount of light output is measured in
lumens. The lumen (lm) is the SI -derived unit of luminous flux and is a measure of the total quantity of visible light
emitted by a source. A 60-W incandescent light bulb can be replaced with a 13- to 15-W CFL bulb or a 6- to 8-W
LED, all three of which have a light output of approximately 800 lm. A table of light output for some commonly used
light bulbs appears in Table 9.2.

The life spans of the three types of bulbs are significantly different. An LED has a life span of 50,000 hours, whereas
the CFL has a lifespan of 8000 hours and the incandescent lasts a mere 1200 hours. The LED is the most durable,
easily withstanding rough treatment such as jarring and bumping. The incandescent light bulb has little tolerance to
the same treatment since the filament and glass can easily break. The CFL bulb is also less durable than the LED
because of its glass construction. The amount of heat emitted is 3.4 btu/h for the 8-W LED, 85 btu/h for the 60-W
incandescent bulb, and 30 btu/h for the CFL bulb. As mentioned earlier, a major drawback of the CFL bulb is that it
contains mercury, a neurotoxin, and must be disposed of as hazardous waste. From these data, it is easy to
understand why the LED is quickly becoming the standard in lighting.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the phenomenon of superconductivity
         · List applications of superconductivity

     Touch the power supply of your laptop computer or some other device. It probably feels slightly warm. That heat is

     an unwanted byproduct of the process of converting household electric power into a current that can be used by

     your device. Although electric power is reasonably efficient, other losses are associated with it. As discussed in the

     section on power and energy, transmission of electric power produces    line losses. These line losses exist

     whether the power is generated from conventional power plants (using coal, oil, or gas), nuclear plants, solar plants,

     hydroelectric plants, or wind farms. These losses can be reduced, but not eliminated, by transmitting using a higher

voltage. It would be wonderful if these line losses could be eliminated, but that would require transmission lines
that have zero resistance. In a world that has a global interest in not wasting energy, the reduction or elimination of
this unwanted thermal energy would be a significant achievement. Is this possible?

The Resistance of Mercury

In 1911, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes of Leiden University, a Dutch physicist, was looking at the temperature

dependence of the resistance of the element mercury. He cooled the sample of mercury and noticed the familiar

behavior of a linear dependence of resistance on temperature; as the temperature decreased, the resistance

decreased. Kamerlingh Onnes continued to cool the sample of mercury, using liquid helium. As the temperature

approached                      , the resistance abruptly went to zero (Figure 9.27). This temperature is known as the

critical temperature for mercury. The sample of mercury entered into a phase where the resistance was

absolutely zero. This phenomenon is known as superconductivity. (Note: If you connect the leads of a three-digit

ohmmeter across a conductor, the reading commonly shows up as            . The resistance of the conductor is not

actually zero, it is less than  .) There are various methods to measure very small resistances, such as the four-

point method, but an ohmmeter is not an acceptable method to use for testing resistance in superconductivity.

FIGURE 9.27 The resistance of a sample of mercury is zero at very low temperatures--it is a superconductor up to the temperature of about
4.2 K. Above that critical temperature, its resistance makes a sudden jump and then increases nearly linearly with temperature.

Other Superconducting Materials

As research continued, several other materials were found to enter a superconducting phase, when the temperature

reached near absolute zero. In 1941, an alloy of niobium-nitride was found that could become superconducting at

              and in 1953, vanadium-silicon was found to become superconductive at

              The temperatures for the transition into superconductivity were slowly creeping higher.

Strangely, many materials that make good conductors, such as copper, silver, and gold, do not exhibit

superconductivity. Imagine the energy savings if transmission lines for electric power-generating stations could be

made to be superconducting at temperatures near room temperature! A resistance of zero ohms means no

losses and a great boost to reducing energy consumption. The problem is that  is still very cold and in

the range of liquid helium temperatures. At this temperature, it is not cost effective to transmit electrical energy

because of the cooling requirements.

A large jump was seen in 1986, when a team of researchers, headed by Dr. Ching Wu Chu of Houston University,

fabricated a brittle, ceramic compound with a transition temperature of       . The ceramic

material, composed of yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO), was an insulator at room temperature. Although this

temperature still seems quite cold, it is near the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, a liquid commonly used in

refrigeration. You may have noticed refrigerated trucks traveling down the highway labeled as "Liquid Nitrogen

Cooled."

YBCO ceramic is a material that could be useful for transmitting electrical energy because the cost saving of

reducing the  losses are larger than the cost of cooling the superconducting cable, making it financially feasible.

There were and are many engineering problems to overcome. For example, unlike traditional electrical cables, which

are flexible and have a decent tensile strength, ceramics are brittle and would break rather than stretch under
392  9 · Current and Resistance

     pressure. Processes that are rather simple with traditional cables, such as making connections, become difficult
     when working with ceramics. The problems are difficult and complex, and material scientists and engineers are
     coming up with innovative solutions.

     An interesting consequence of the resistance going to zero is that once a current is established in a superconductor,
     it persists without an applied voltage source. Current loops in a superconductor have been set up and the current
     loops have been observed to persist for years without decaying.

     Zero resistance is not the only interesting phenomenon that occurs as the materials reach their transition
     temperatures. A second effect is the exclusion of magnetic fields. This is known as the Meissner effect (Figure
     9.28). A light, permanent magnet placed over a superconducting sample will levitate in a stable position above the
     superconductor. High-speed trains have been developed that levitate on strong superconducting magnets,
     eliminating the friction normally experienced between the train and the tracks. In Japan, the Yamanashi Maglev test
     line opened on April 3, 1997. In April 2015, the MLX01 test vehicle attained a speed of 374 mph (603 km/h).

     Table 9.3 shows a select list of elements, compounds, and high-temperature superconductors, along with the
     critical temperatures for which they become superconducting. Each section is sorted from the highest critical
     temperature to the lowest. Also listed is the critical magnetic field for some of the materials. This is the strength of
     the magnetic field that destroys superconductivity. Finally, the type of the superconductor is listed.

     There are two types of superconductors. There are 30 pure metals that exhibit zero resistivity below their critical
     temperature and exhibit the Meissner effect, the property of excluding magnetic fields from the interior of the
     superconductor while the superconductor is at a temperature below the critical temperature. These metals are
     called Type I superconductors. The superconductivity exists only below their critical temperatures and below a
     critical magnetic field strength. Type I superconductors are well described by the BCS theory (described next). Type
     I superconductors have limited practical applications because the strength of the critical magnetic field needed to
     destroy the superconductivity is quite low.

     Type II superconductors are found to have much higher critical magnetic fields and therefore can carry much higher
     current densities while remaining in the superconducting state. A collection of various ceramics containing barium-
     copper-oxide have much higher critical temperatures for the transition into a superconducting state.
     Superconducting materials that belong to this subcategory of the Type II superconductors are often categorized as
     high-temperature superconductors.

     Introduction to BCS Theory

     Type I superconductors, along with some Type II superconductors can be modeled using the BCS theory, proposed
     by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and Robert Schrieffer. Although the theory is beyond the scope of this chapter, a
     short summary of the theory is provided here. (More detail is provided in Condensed Matter Physics
     (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/9-introduction).) The theory considers pairs of
     electrons and how they are coupled together through lattice-vibration interactions. Through the interactions with
     the crystalline lattice, electrons near the Fermi energy level feel a small attractive force and form pairs (Cooper
     pairs), and the coupling is known as a phonon interaction. Single electrons are fermions, which are particles that

obey the Pauli exclusion principle. The Pauli exclusion principle in quantum mechanics states that two identical

fermions (particles with half-integer spin) cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. Each electron has

four quantum numbers        . The principal quantum number (n) describes the energy of the electron, the

orbital angular momentum quantum number (l) indicates the most probable distance from the nucleus, the

magnetic quantum number describes the energy levels in the subshell, and the electron spin quantum number

describes the orientation of the spin of the electron, either up or down. As the material enters a

superconducting state, pairs of electrons act more like bosons, which can condense into the same energy level and

need not obey the Pauli exclusion principle. The electron pairs have a slightly lower energy and leave an energy gap

above them on the order of 0.001 eV. This energy gap inhibits collision interactions that lead to ordinary resistivity.

When the material is below the critical temperature, the thermal energy is less than the band gap and the material

exhibits zero resistivity.

     Applications of Superconductors

     Superconductors can be used to make superconducting magnets. These magnets are 10 times stronger than the
     strongest electromagnets. These magnets are currently in use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which
     produces high-quality images of the body interior without dangerous radiation.

     Another interesting application of superconductivity is the SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device).
     A SQUID is a very sensitive magnetometer used to measure extremely subtle magnetic fields. The operation of the
     SQUID is based on superconducting loops containing Josephson junctions. A Josephson junction is the result of a
     theoretical prediction made by B. D. Josephson in an article published in 1962. In the article, Josephson described
     how a supercurrent can flow between two pieces of superconductor separated by a thin layer of insulator. This
     phenomenon is now called the Josephson effect. The SQUID consists of a superconducting current loop containing
     two Josephson junctions, as shown in Figure 9.29. When the loop is placed in even a very weak magnetic field, there
     is an interference effect that depends on the strength of the magnetic field.

Superconductivity is a fascinating and useful phenomenon. At critical temperatures near the boiling point of liquid
nitrogen, superconductivity has special applications in MRIs, particle accelerators, and high-speed trains. Will we
reach a state where we can have materials enter the superconducting phase at near room temperatures? It seems a
long way off, but if scientists in 1911 were asked if we would reach liquid-nitrogen temperatures with a ceramic,
they might have thought it implausible.

components connected to accomplish a specific task. Figure 10.1 shows an amplifier circuit, which takes a small-

consists of a set of series, parallel, and series-parallel circuits. The second section of this chapter covers the
analysis of series and parallel circuits that consist of resistors. Later in this chapter, we introduce the basic
equations and techniques to analyze any circuit, including those that are not reducible through simplifying parallel

     10.1 Electromotive Force

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of the section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the electromotive force (emf) and the internal resistance of a battery
         · Explain the basic operation of a battery

     Battery life is an essential consideration for every user of mobile phones, laptop computers, and electric vehicles.
     The reliability of a battery and its ability to hold a charge can impact every aspect of our day. For many people,
     battery reliability is even more important.

     Each year, over 300,000 implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are surgically provided to people at risk of
     sudden and life-threatening arrythmia, such as a heart beating too fast or irregularly. Similar to (and sometimes
     combined with) pacemakers, ICDs monitor patients' hearts and deliver electrical shocks to correct iregular activity.
     Since they must function properly at all times, battery life and reliability are critically important. Early ICDs had
     minimal power output and brief battery lives, which required frequent surgical replacement and made them
     impractical.

     Esther Sans Takeuchi began addressing this problem in the 1980s, when she experimented with new chemical
     compositions and designs to increase the power and reliability of ICD and similar batteries. Her initial lithium-silver
     vanadium oxide batteries increased longevity and power output, making ICDs a viable option for hundreds of
     thousands of people. Takeuchi eventually became the chief scientist at the Department of Energy's Brookhaven
     National Laboratory, and her continued work has impacted a wide array of medical technologies, electric vehicles,
     and other battery applications.

     In this section, we examine the principles of battery power and similar voltage sources, particularly the energy
     creation and internal resistance.

     Introduction to Electromotive Force

     Voltage has many sources, a few of which are shown in Figure 10.2. All such devices create a potential difference
     and can supply current if connected to a circuit. A special type of potential difference is known as electromotive
     force (emf). The emf is not a force at all, but the term `electromotive force' is used for historical reasons. It was
     coined by Alessandro Volta in the 1800s, when he invented the first battery, also known as the voltaic pile. Because
     the electromotive force is not a force, it is common to refer to these sources simply as sources of emf (pronounced
     as the letters "ee-em-eff"), instead of sources of electromotive force.

If the electromotive force is not a force at all, then what is the emf and what is a source of emf? To answer these
questions, consider a simple circuit of a 12-V lamp attached to a 12-V battery, as shown in Figure 10.3. The battery
can be modeled as a two-terminal device that keeps one terminal at a higher electric potential than the second
terminal. The higher electric potential is sometimes called the positive terminal and is labeled with a plus sign. The
lower-potential terminal is sometimes called the negative terminal and labeled with a minus sign. This is the source
of the emf.

FIGURE 10.3 A source of emf maintains one terminal at a higher electric potential than the other terminal, acting as a source of current in a
circuit.

When the emf source is not connected to the lamp, there is no net flow of charge within the emf source. Once the
battery is connected to the lamp, charges flow from one terminal of the battery, through the lamp (causing the lamp
408  10 · Direct-Current Circuits

     to light), and back to the other terminal of the battery. If we consider positive (conventional) current flow, positive
     charges leave the positive terminal, travel through the lamp, and enter the negative terminal.

     Positive current flow is useful for most of the circuit analysis in this chapter, but in metallic wires and resistors,
     electrons contribute the most to current, flowing in the opposite direction of positive current flow. Therefore, it is
     more realistic to consider the movement of electrons for the analysis of the circuit in Figure 10.3. The electrons
     leave the negative terminal, travel through the lamp, and return to the positive terminal. In order for the emf source
     to maintain the potential difference between the two terminals, negative charges (electrons) must be moved from
     the positive terminal to the negative terminal. The emf source acts as a charge pump, moving negative charges from
     the positive terminal to the negative terminal to maintain the potential difference. This increases the potential
     energy of the charges and, therefore, the electric potential of the charges.

     The force on the negative charge from the electric field is in the opposite direction of the electric field, as shown in
     Figure 10.3. In order for the negative charges to be moved to the negative terminal, work must be done on the
     negative charges. This requires energy, which comes from chemical reactions in the battery. The potential is kept
     high on the positive terminal and low on the negative terminal to maintain the potential difference between the two

     terminals. The emf is equal to the work done on the charge per unit charge  when there is no current

     flowing. Since the unit for work is the joule and the unit for charge is the coulomb, the unit for emf is the volt

     The terminal voltage          of a battery is voltage measured across the terminals of the battery. An ideal battery

     is an emf source that maintains a constant terminal voltage, independent of the current between the two terminals.

     An ideal battery has no internal resistance, and the terminal voltage is equal to the emf of the battery. In the next

     section, we will show that a real battery does have internal resistance and the terminal voltage is always less than

     the emf of the battery.

     The Origin of Battery Potential

     The combination of chemicals and the makeup of the terminals in a battery determine its emf. The lead acid battery
     used in cars and other vehicles is one of the most common combinations of chemicals. Figure 10.4 shows a single
     cell (one of six) of this battery. The cathode (positive) terminal of the cell is connected to a lead oxide plate, whereas
     the anode (negative) terminal is connected to a lead plate. Both plates are immersed in sulfuric acid, the electrolyte
     for the system.

     FIGURE 10.4 Chemical reactions in a lead-acid cell separate charge, sending negative charge to the anode, which is connected to the lead
     plates. The lead oxide plates are connected to the positive or cathode terminal of the cell. Sulfuric acid conducts the charge, as well as
     participates in the chemical reaction.

     Knowing a little about how the chemicals in a lead-acid battery interact helps in understanding the potential created
     by the battery. Figure 10.5 shows the result of a single chemical reaction. Two electrons are placed on the anode,
     making it negative, provided that the cathode supplies two electrons. This leaves the cathode positively charged,

10.1 · Electromotive Force                                                                                                                409

because it has lost two electrons. In short, a separation of charge has been driven by a chemical reaction.

Note that the reaction does not take place unless there is a complete circuit to allow two electrons to be supplied to
the cathode. Under many circumstances, these electrons come from the anode, flow through a resistance, and
return to the cathode. Note also that since the chemical reactions involve substances with resistance, it is not
possible to create the emf without an internal resistance.

FIGURE 10.5 In a lead-acid battery, two electrons are forced onto the anode of a cell, and two electrons are removed from the cathode of
the cell. The chemical reaction in a lead-acid battery places two electrons on the anode and removes two from the cathode. It requires a
closed circuit to proceed, since the two electrons must be supplied to the cathode.

You are likely familiar with many other types of batteries, such as the lithium-ion batteries found in many devices.
These function in the same general way as lead-acid batteries, but utilize different chemicals. The specific
compounds vary significantly, and researchers and companies continually innovate based on the requirements of
each device. In many cases, the anode is composed of graphite, silicon-based materials, or metallic lithium. The
cathode is often composed of lithium oxide compound, which may also contain manganese, cobalt, or other
materials. And the electrolyte is usually a type of lithium salt.

Internal Resistance and Terminal Voltage

The amount of resistance to the flow of current within the voltage source is called the internal resistance. The
internal resistance r of a battery can behave in complex ways. It generally increases as a battery is depleted, due to
the oxidation of the plates or the reduction of the acidity of the electrolyte. However, internal resistance may also
depend on the magnitude and direction of the current through a voltage source, its temperature, and even its
history. The internal resistance of rechargeable nickel-cadmium cells, for example, depends on how many times and
how deeply they have been depleted. A simple model for a battery consists of an idealized emf source and an
internal resistance r (Figure 10.6).
410  10 · Direct-Current Circuits

     FIGURE 10.6 A battery can be modeled as an idealized emf  with an internal resistance (r). The terminal voltage of the battery is
                              .

     Suppose an external resistor, known as the load resistance R, is connected to a voltage source such as a battery, as
     in Figure 10.7. The figure shows a model of a battery with an emf , an internal resistance r, and a load resistor R
     connected across its terminals. Using conventional current flow, positive charges leave the positive terminal of the
     battery, travel through the resistor, and return to the negative terminal of the battery. The terminal voltage of the
     battery depends on the emf, the internal resistance, and the current, and is equal to

                                                                                                                                            10.1

     For a given emf and internal resistance, the terminal voltage decreases as the current increases due to the potential
     drop Ir of the internal resistance.

     FIGURE 10.7 Schematic of a voltage source and its load resistor R. Since the internal resistance r is in series with the load, it can
     significantly affect the terminal voltage and the current delivered to the load.

     A graph of the potential difference across each element of the circuit is shown in Figure 10.8. A current I runs

     through the circuit, and the potential drop across the internal resistor is equal to Ir. The terminal voltage is equal to

     , which is equal to the potential drop across the load resistor  . As with potential energy, it is the

     change in voltage that is important. When the term "voltage" is used, we assume that it is actually the change in the

internal resistance. The potential decreases due to the internal resistance  , making the terminal voltage of the battery equal to

. The voltage then decreases by (IR). The current is equal to

The current through the load resistor is  . We see from this expression that the smaller the internal

resistance r, the greater the current the voltage source supplies to its load R. As batteries are depleted, r increases.
If r becomes a significant fraction of the load resistance, then the current is significantly reduced, as the following
example illustrates.

EXAMPLE 10.1

Analyzing a Circuit with a Battery and a Load

A given battery has a 12.00-V emf and an internal resistance of              . (a) Calculate its terminal voltage when

connected to a       load. (b) What is the terminal voltage when connected to a  load? (c) What power

does the        load dissipate? (d) If the internal resistance grows to      , find the current, terminal voltage,

and power dissipated by a    load.

Strategy

The analysis above gave an expression for current when internal resistance is taken into account. Once the current is

found, the terminal voltage can be calculated by using the equation              . Once current is found, we

can also find the power dissipated by the resistor.

Solution

a. Entering the given values for the emf, load resistance, and internal resistance into the expression above yields

Enter the known values into the equation                                     to get the terminal voltage:

The terminal voltage here is only slightly lower than the emf, implying that the current drawn by this light load

is not significant.

b. Similarly, with           , the current is

The terminal voltage is now

The terminal voltage exhibits a more significant reduction compared with emf, implying                     is a heavy

load for this battery. A "heavy load" signifies a larger draw of current from the source but not a larger

resistance.
412  10 · Direct-Current Circuits

     c. The power dissipated by the  load can be found using the formula  . Entering the known
          values gives

     Note that this power can also be obtained using the expression  , where V is the terminal voltage

          (10.0 V in this case).
     d. Here, the internal resistance has increased, perhaps due to the depletion of the battery, to the point where it is

          as great as the load resistance. As before, we first find the current by entering the known values into the
          expression, yielding

             Now the terminal voltage is

             and the power dissipated by the load is

             We see that the increased internal resistance has significantly decreased the terminal voltage, current, and
             power delivered to a load.
     Significance
     The internal resistance of a battery can increase for many reasons. For example, the internal resistance of a
     rechargeable battery increases as the number of times the battery is recharged increases. The increased internal
     resistance may have two effects on the battery. First, the terminal voltage will decrease. Second, the battery may
     overheat due to the increased power dissipated by the internal resistance.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 10.1

     If you place a wire directly across the two terminal of a battery, effectively shorting out the terminals, the battery
     will begin to get hot. Why do you suppose this happens?

     Battery Testers

     Battery testers, such as those in Figure 10.9, use small load resistors to intentionally draw current to determine
     whether the terminal potential drops below an acceptable level. Although it is difficult to measure the internal
     resistance of a battery, battery testers can provide a measurement of the internal resistance of the battery. If
     internal resistance is high, the battery is weak, as evidenced by its low terminal voltage.

     technician uses a battery tester to test large batteries aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz. The battery tester she uses has a small

Some batteries can be recharged by passing a current through them in the direction opposite to the current they
supply to an appliance. This is done routinely in cars and in batteries for small electrical appliances and electronic
devices (Figure 10.10). The voltage output of the battery charger must be greater than the emf of the battery to
reverse the current through it. This causes the terminal voltage of the battery to be greater than the emf, since

                and I is now negative.

FIGURE 10.10 A car battery charger reverses the normal direction of current through a battery, reversing its chemical reaction and
replenishing its chemical potential.

It is important to understand the consequences of the internal resistance of emf sources, such as batteries and
solar cells, but often, the analysis of circuits is done with the terminal voltage of the battery, as we have done in the
previous sections. The terminal voltage is referred to simply as V, dropping the subscript "terminal." This is because
the internal resistance of the battery is difficult to measure directly and can change over time.

10.2 Resistors in Series and Parallel

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define the term equivalent resistance
    · Calculate the equivalent resistance of resistors connected in series
    · Calculate the equivalent resistance of resistors connected in parallel

In Current and Resistance, we described the term `resistance' and explained the basic design of a resistor. Basically,

a resistor limits the flow of charge in a circuit and is an ohmic device where  Most circuits have more than

one resistor. If several resistors are connected together and connected to a battery, the current supplied by the

battery depends on the equivalent resistance of the circuit.

The equivalent resistance of a combination of resistors depends on both their individual values and how they are
connected. The simplest combinations of resistors are series and parallel connections (Figure 10.11). In a series
circuit, the output current of the first resistor flows into the input of the second resistor; therefore, the current is the
same in each resistor. In a parallel circuit, all of the resistor leads on one side of the resistors are connected
together and all the leads on the other side are connected together. In the case of a parallel configuration, each
resistor has the same potential drop across it, and the currents through each resistor may be different, depending
on the resistor. The sum of the individual currents equals the current that flows into the parallel connections.

     FIGURE 10.11 (a) For a series connection of resistors, the current is the same in each resistor. (b) For a parallel connection of resistors, the
     voltage is the same across each resistor.

     Resistors in Series

     Resistors are said to be in series whenever the current flows through the resistors sequentially. Consider Figure
     10.12, which shows three resistors in series with an applied voltage equal to Since there is only one path for
     the charges to flow through, the current is the same through each resistor. The equivalent resistance of a set of
     resistors in a series connection is equal to the algebraic sum of the individual resistances.

     FIGURE 10.12 (a) Three resistors connected in series to a voltage source. (b) The original circuit is reduced to an equivalent resistance and
     a voltage source.

     In Figure 10.12, the current coming from the voltage source flows through each resistor, so the current through each

     resistor is the same. The current through the circuit depends on the voltage supplied by the voltage source and the

     resistance of the resistors. For each resistor, a potential drop occurs that is equal to the loss of electric potential

     energy as a current travels through each resistor. According to Ohm's law, the potential drop V across a resistor

     when a current flows through it is calculated using the equation  where I is the current in amps (A) and R is

     the resistance in ohms Since energy is conserved, and the voltage is equal to the potential energy per charge,

     the sum of the voltage applied to the circuit by the source and the potential drops across the individual resistors

     around a loop should be equal to zero:

     This equation is often referred to as Kirchhoff's loop law, which we will look at in more detail later in this chapter. For
     Figure 10.12, the sum of the potential drop of each resistor and the voltage supplied by the voltage source should
     equal zero:

Since the current through each component is the same, the equality can be simplified to an equivalent resistance,
which is just the sum of the resistances of the individual resistors.
Any number of resistors can be connected in series. If N resistors are connected in series, the equivalent resistance
is

                                                                                                                                                     10.2

One result of components connected in a series circuit is that if something happens to one component, it affects all
the other components. For example, if several lamps are connected in series and one bulb burns out, all the other
lamps go dark.

EXAMPLE 10.2

Equivalent Resistance, Current, and Power in a Series Circuit

A battery with a terminal voltage of 9 V is connected to a circuit consisting of four  and one  resistors all in

series (Figure 10.13). Assume the battery has negligible internal resistance. (a) Calculate the equivalent resistance

of the circuit. (b) Calculate the current through each resistor. (c) Calculate the potential drop across each resistor. (d)

Determine the total power dissipated by the resistors and the power supplied by the battery.

              FIGURE 10.13 A simple series circuit with five resistors.

Strategy

In a series circuit, the equivalent resistance is the algebraic sum of the resistances. The current through the circuit
can be found from Ohm's law and is equal to the voltage divided by the equivalent resistance. The potential drop
across each resistor can be found using Ohm's law. The power dissipated by each resistor can be found using

          , and the total power dissipated by the resistors is equal to the sum of the power dissipated by each

resistor. The power supplied by the battery can be found using  .

Solution

a. The equivalent resistance is the algebraic sum of the resistances:

b. The current through the circuit is the same for each resistor in a series circuit and is equal to the applied
     voltage divided by the equivalent resistance:

c. The potential drop across each resistor can be found using Ohm's law:

     Note that the sum of the potential drops across each resistor is equal to the voltage supplied by the battery.

     d. The power dissipated by a resistor is equal to  , and the power supplied by the battery is equal to

     :

     Significance
     There are several reasons why we would use multiple resistors instead of just one resistor with a resistance equal to
     the equivalent resistance of the circuit. Perhaps a resistor of the required size is not available, or we need to
     dissipate the heat generated, or we want to minimize the cost of resistors. Each resistor may cost a few cents to a
     few dollars, but when multiplied by thousands of units, the cost saving may be appreciable.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 10.2

     Some strings of miniature holiday lights are made to short out when a bulb burns out. The device that causes the
     short is called a shunt, which allows current to flow around the open circuit. A "short" is like putting a piece of wire
     across the component. The bulbs are usually grouped in series of nine bulbs. If too many bulbs burn out, the shunts
     eventually open. What causes this?

     Let's briefly summarize the major features of resistors in series:
       1. Series resistances add together to get the equivalent resistance:

     2. The same current flows through each resistor in series.
     3. Individual resistors in series do not get the total source voltage, but divide it. The total potential drop across a

          series configuration of resistors is equal to the sum of the potential drops across each resistor.

     Resistors in Parallel

     Figure 10.14 shows resistors in parallel, wired to a voltage source. Resistors are in parallel when one end of all the

     resistors are connected by a continuous wire of negligible resistance and the other end of all the resistors are also

     connected to one another through a continuous wire of negligible resistance. The potential drop across each resistor

     is the same. Current through each resistor can be found using Ohm's law  where the voltage is constant

     across each resistor. For example, an automobile's headlights, radio, and other systems are wired in parallel, so that

     each subsystem utilizes the full voltage of the source and can operate completely independently. The same is true of

     the wiring in your house or any building.

FIGURE 10.14 (a) Two resistors connected in parallel to a voltage source. (b) The original circuit is reduced to an equivalent resistance and
a voltage source.

The current flowing from the voltage source in Figure 10.14 depends on the voltage supplied by the voltage source
and the equivalent resistance of the circuit. In this case, the current flows from the voltage source and enters a
junction, or node, where the circuit splits flowing through resistors and . As the charges flow from the battery,
some go through resistor and some flow through resistor The sum of the currents flowing into a junction
must be equal to the sum of the currents flowing out of the junction:

This equation is referred to as Kirchhoff's junction rule and will be discussed in detail in the next section. In Figure

10.14, the junction rule gives  . There are two loops in this circuit, which leads to the equations

and                             . Note the voltage across the resistors in parallel are the same     and

the current is additive:

Generalizing to any number of N resistors, the equivalent resistance  of a parallel connection is related to the
individual resistances by

                                                                                                     10.3

This relationship results in an equivalent resistance that is less than the smallest of the individual resistances.
When resistors are connected in parallel, more current flows from the source than would flow for any of them
individually, so the total resistance is lower.

     More complex connections of resistors are often just combinations of series and parallel connections. Such
     combinations are common, especially when wire resistance is considered. In that case, wire resistance is in series
     with other resistances that are in parallel.

     Combinations of series and parallel can be reduced to a single equivalent resistance using the technique illustrated
     in Figure 10.15. Various parts can be identified as either series or parallel connections, reduced to their equivalent

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 10.5

Consider the electrical circuits in your home. Give at least two examples of circuits that must use a combination of
series and parallel circuits to operate efficiently.

Practical Implications

One implication of this last example is that resistance in wires reduces the current and power delivered to a resistor.
If wire resistance is relatively large, as in a worn (or a very long) extension cord, then this loss can be significant. If a
large current is drawn, the IR drop in the wires can also be significant and may become apparent from the heat
generated in the cord.

For example, when you are rummaging in the refrigerator and the motor comes on, the refrigerator light dims
momentarily. Similarly, you can see the passenger compartment light dim when you start the engine of your car
(although this may be due to resistance inside the battery itself).

What is happening in these high-current situations is illustrated in Figure 10.17. The device represented by has a
very low resistance, so when it is switched on, a large current flows. This increased current causes a larger IR drop
in the wires represented by , reducing the voltage across the light bulb (which is ), which then dims noticeably.

FIGURE 10.17 Why do lights dim when a large appliance is switched on? The answer is that the large current the appliance motor draws
causes a significant IR drop in the wires and reduces the voltage across the light.

Since they are in series, the current through equals the current through Since  , the current

through each will be 1.00 Amps. The power dissipated by the resistors is equal to the sum of the power

dissipated by each resistor:

        Since the power dissipated by the resistors equals the power supplied by the battery, our solution seems
        consistent.

Significance
If a problem has a combination of series and parallel, as in this example, it can be reduced in steps by using the
preceding problem-solving strategy and by considering individual groups of series or parallel connections. When
finding for a parallel connection, the reciprocal must be taken with care. In addition, units and numerical results
must be reasonable. Equivalent series resistance should be greater, whereas equivalent parallel resistance should
be smaller, for example. Power should be greater for the same devices in parallel compared with series, and so on.

10.3 Kirchhoff's Rules

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · State Kirchhoff's junction rule
    · State Kirchhoff's loop rule
    · Analyze complex circuits using Kirchhoff's rules

We have just seen that some circuits may be analyzed by reducing a circuit to a single voltage source and an
equivalent resistance. Many complex circuits cannot be analyzed with the series-parallel techniques developed in
the preceding sections. In this section, we elaborate on the use of Kirchhoff's rules to analyze more complex
circuits. For example, the circuit in Figure 10.19 is known as a multi-loop circuit, which consists of junctions. A
junction, also known as a node, is a connection of three or more wires. In this circuit, the previous methods cannot
be used, because not all the resistors are in clear series or parallel configurations that can be reduced. Give it a try.
The resistors and are in series and can be reduced to an equivalent resistance. The same is true of resistors

     and . But what do you do then?

Even though this circuit cannot be analyzed using the methods already learned, two circuit analysis rules can be
used to analyze any circuit, simple or complex. The rules are known as Kirchhoff's rules, after their inventor Gustav
Kirchhoff (1824-1887).

FIGURE 10.19 This circuit cannot be reduced to a combination of series and parallel connections. However, we can use Kirchhoff's rules to
analyze it.

     KIRCHHOFF'S RULES

     · Kirchhoff's first rule--the junction rule. The sum of all currents entering a junction must equal the sum of

     all currents leaving the junction:                                                            10.4

     · Kirchhoff's second rule--the loop rule. The algebraic sum of changes in potential around any closed circuit

     path (loop) must be zero:                                                                     10.5

     We now provide explanations of these two rules, followed by problem-solving hints for applying them and a worked
     example that uses them.

     Kirchhoff's First Rule

     Kirchhoff's first rule (the junction rule) applies to the charge entering and leaving a junction (Figure 10.20). As
     stated earlier, a junction, or node, is a connection of three or more wires. Current is the flow of charge, and charge is
     conserved; thus, whatever charge flows into the junction must flow out.

     FIGURE 10.20 Charge must be conserved, so the sum of currents into a junction must be equal to the sum of currents out of the junction.

     Although it is an over-simplification, an analogy can be made with water pipes connected in a plumbing junction. If
     the wires in Figure 10.20 were replaced by water pipes, and the water was assumed to be incompressible, the
     volume of water flowing into the junction must equal the volume of water flowing out of the junction.

     Kirchhoff's Second Rule

     Kirchhoff's second rule (the loop rule) applies to potential differences. The loop rule is stated in terms of potential V

     rather than potential energy, but the two are related since  In a closed loop, whatever energy is supplied by

     a voltage source, the energy must be transferred into other forms by the devices in the loop, since there are no other

     ways in which energy can be transferred into or out of the circuit. Kirchhoff's loop rule states that the algebraic sum

     of potential differences, including voltage supplied by the voltage sources and resistive elements, in any loop must

     be equal to zero. For example, consider a simple loop with no junctions, as in Figure 10.21.

     FIGURE 10.21 A simple loop with no junctions. Kirchhoff's loop rule states that the algebraic sum of the voltage differences is equal to zero.

     The circuit consists of a voltage source and three external load resistors. The labels a, b, c, and d serve as

references, and have no other significance. The usefulness of these labels will become apparent soon. The loop is
designated as Loop abcda, and the labels help keep track of the voltage differences as we travel around the circuit.
Start at point a and travel to point b. The voltage of the voltage source is added to the equation and the potential
drop of the resistor is subtracted. From point b to c, the potential drop across is subtracted. From c to d, the
potential drop across is subtracted. From points d to a, nothing is done because there are no components.

Figure 10.22 shows a graph of the voltage as we travel around the loop. Voltage increases as we cross the battery,
whereas voltage decreases as we travel across a resistor. The potential drop, or change in the electric potential, is
equal to the current through the resistor times the resistance of the resistor. Since the wires have negligible
resistance, the voltage remains constant as we cross the wires connecting the components.

FIGURE 10.22 A voltage graph as we travel around the circuit. The voltage increases as we cross the battery and decreases as we cross
each resistor. Since the resistance of the wire is quite small, we assume that the voltage remains constant as we cross the wires connecting
the components.

Then Kirchhoff's loop rule states

The loop equation can be used to find the current through the loop:

This loop could have been analyzed using the previous methods, but we will demonstrate the power of Kirchhoff's
method in the next section.

Applying Kirchhoff's Rules

By applying Kirchhoff's rules, we generate a set of linear equations that allow us to find the unknown values in
circuits. These may be currents, voltages, or resistances. Each time a rule is applied, it produces an equation. If
there are as many independent equations as unknowns, then the problem can be solved.
Using Kirchhoff's method of analysis requires several steps, as listed in the following procedure.

        PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Kirchhoff's Rules

  1. Label points in the circuit diagram using lowercase letters a, b, c, .... These labels simply help with orientation.
  2. Locate the junctions in the circuit. The junctions are points where three or more wires connect. Label each

        junction with the currents and directions into and out of it. Make sure at least one current points into the
        junction and at least one current points out of the junction.
  3. Choose the loops in the circuit. Every component must be contained in at least one loop, but a component
        may be contained in more than one loop.
  4. Apply the junction rule. Again, some junctions should not be included in the analysis. You need only use
        enough nodes to include every current.
  5. Apply the loop rule. Use the map in Figure 10.23.
428  10 · Direct-Current Circuits

     FIGURE 10.23 Each of these resistors and voltage sources is traversed from a to b. (a) When moving across a resistor in the same direction
     as the current flow, subtract the potential drop. (b) When moving across a resistor in the opposite direction as the current flow, add the
     potential drop. (c) When moving across a voltage source from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, add the potential drop. (d)
     When moving across a voltage source from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, subtract the potential drop.

     Let's examine some steps in this procedure more closely. When locating the junctions in the circuit, do not be
     concerned about the direction of the currents. If the direction of current flow is not obvious, choosing any direction
     is sufficient as long as at least one current points into the junction and at least one current points out of the junction.
     If the arrow is in the opposite direction of the conventional current flow, the result for the current in question will be
     negative but the answer will still be correct.

     The number of nodes depends on the circuit. Each current should be included in a node and thus included in at least
     one junction equation. Do not include nodes that are not linearly independent, meaning nodes that contain the same
     information.

     Consider Figure 10.24. There are two junctions in this circuit: Junction b and Junction e. Points a, c, d, and f are not

     junctions, because a junction must have three or more connections. The equation for Junction b is  ,

     and the equation for Junction e is  . These are equivalent equations, so it is necessary to keep only one

     of them.

     FIGURE 10.24 At first glance, this circuit contains two junctions, Junction b and Junction e, but only one should be considered because
     their junction equations are equivalent.

     When choosing the loops in the circuit, you need enough loops so that each component is covered once, without
     repeating loops. Figure 10.25 shows four choices for loops to solve a sample circuit; choices (a), (b), and (c) have a
     sufficient amount of loops to solve the circuit completely. Option (d) reflects more loops than necessary to solve the
     circuit.

FIGURE 10.25 Panels (a)-(c) are sufficient for the analysis of the circuit. In each case, the two loops shown contain all the circuit elements
necessary to solve the circuit completely. Panel (d) shows three loops used, which is more than necessary. Any two loops in the system will
contain all information needed to solve the circuit. Adding the third loop provides redundant information.

Consider the circuit in Figure 10.26(a). Let us analyze this circuit to find the current through each resistor. First, label
the circuit as shown in part (b).

      FIGURE 10.26 (a) A multi-loop circuit. (b) Label the circuit to help with orientation.

Next, determine the junctions. In this circuit, points b and e each have three wires connected, making them

junctions. Start to apply Kirchhoff's junction rule  by drawing arrows representing the currents

and labeling each arrow, as shown in Figure 10.27(b). Junction b shows that     and Junction e shows

that  . Since Junction e gives the same information of Junction b, it can be disregarded. This circuit has

three unknowns, so we need three linearly independent equations to analyze it.
430  10 · Direct-Current Circuits

     FIGURE 10.27 (a) This circuit has two junctions, labeled b and e, but only node b is used in the analysis. (b) Labeled arrows represent the
     currents into and out of the junctions.

     Next we need to choose the loops. In Figure 10.28, Loop abefa includes the voltage source and resistors and
         . The loop starts at point a, then travels through points b, e, and f, and then back to point a. The second loop,

     Loop ebcde, starts at point e and includes resistors and , and the voltage source .

                                        FIGURE 10.28 Choose the loops in the circuit.

     Now we can apply Kirchhoff's loop rule, using the map in Figure 10.23. Starting at point a and moving to point b, the

     resistor is crossed in the same direction as the current flow , so the potential drop  is subtracted. Moving

     from point b to point e, the resistor is crossed in the same direction as the current flow so the potential drop

     is subtracted. Moving from point e to point f, the voltage source is crossed from the negative terminal to

     the positive terminal, so is added. There are no components between points f and a. The sum of the voltage

     differences must equal zero:

     Finally, we check loop ebcde. We start at point e and move to point b, crossing in the opposite direction as the

     current flow . The potential drop      is added. Next, we cross and in the same direction as the current

     flow and subtract the potential drops  and  Note that the current is the same through resistors

     and , because they are connected in series. Finally, the voltage source is crossed from the positive terminal to the

     negative terminal, and the voltage source is subtracted. The sum of these voltage differences equals zero and

     yields the loop equation

     We now have three equations, which we can solve for the three unknowns.

To solve the three equations for the three unknown currents, start by eliminating current  . First add Eq. (1) times
     to Eq. (2). The result is labeled as Eq. (4):

Next, subtract Eq. (3) from Eq. (2). The result is labeled as Eq. (5):

We can solve Eqs. (4) and (5) for current . Adding seven times Eq. (4) and three times Eq. (5) results in

or  Using Eq. (4) results in                                            Finally, Eq. (1) yields

    One way to check that the solutions are consistent is to check the power supplied by the

voltage sources and the power dissipated by the resistors:

Note that the solution for the current is negative. This is the correct answer, but suggests that the arrow originally
drawn in the junction analysis is the direction opposite of conventional current flow. The power supplied by the
second voltage source is 58 W and not -58 W.

     Strategy

     This circuit is sufficiently complex that the currents cannot be found using Ohm's law and the series-parallel

     techniques--it is necessary to use Kirchhoff's rules. Currents have been labeled  and in the figure, and

     assumptions have been made about their directions. Locations on the diagram have been labeled with letters a

     through h. In the solution, we apply the junction and loop rules, seeking three independent equations to allow us to

     solve for the three unknown currents.

     Solution
     Applying the junction and loop rules yields the following three equations. We have three unknowns, so three
     equations are required.

     Significance

     The power dissipated or consumed by the circuit equals the power supplied to the circuit, but notice that the current
     in the battery is flowing through the battery from the positive terminal to the negative terminal and consumes
     power.

     The power supplied equals the power dissipated by the resistors and consumed by the battery

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 10.7

     When using Kirchhoff's laws, you need to decide which loops to use and the direction of current flow through each
     loop. In analyzing the circuit in Example 10.7, the direction of current flow was chosen to be clockwise, from point a
     to point b. How would the results change if the direction of the current was chosen to be counterclockwise, from
     point b to point a?

     Multiple Voltage Sources

     Many devices require more than one battery. Multiple voltage sources, such as batteries, can be connected in series

FIGURE 10.31 (a) Two batteries connected in series with a load resistor. (b) The circuit diagram of the two batteries and the load resistor,
with each battery modeled as an idealized emf source and an internal resistance.

When voltage sources are in series, their internal resistances can be added together and their emfs can be added
together to get the total values. Series connections of voltage sources are common--for example, in flashlights, toys,
and other appliances. Usually, the cells are in series in order to produce a larger total emf. In Figure 10.31, the
terminal voltage is

Note that the same current I is found in each battery because they are connected in series. The disadvantage of
series connections of cells is that their internal resistances are additive.
Batteries are connected in series to increase the voltage supplied to the circuit. For instance, an LED flashlight may
have two AAA cell batteries, each with a terminal voltage of 1.5 V, to provide 3.0 V to the flashlight.
Any number of batteries can be connected in series. For N batteries in series, the terminal voltage is equal to

                                                                                                                                                     10.6

where the equivalent resistance is  .

When a load is placed across voltage sources in series, as in Figure 10.32, we can find the current:

As expected, the internal resistances increase the equivalent resistance.

     Voltage sources, such as batteries, can also be connected in parallel. Figure 10.33 shows two batteries with
     identical emfs in parallel and connected to a load resistance. When the batteries are connect in parallel, the positive
     terminals are connected together and the negative terminals are connected together, and the load resistance is
     connected to the positive and negative terminals. Normally, voltage sources in parallel have identical emfs. In this
     simple case, since the voltage sources are in parallel, the total emf is the same as the individual emfs of each

where the equivalent resistance is  .

As an example, some diesel trucks use two 12-V batteries in parallel; they produce a total emf of 12 V but can
deliver the larger current needed to start a diesel engine.

In summary, the terminal voltage of batteries in series is equal to the sum of the individual emfs minus the sum of
the internal resistances times the current. When batteries are connected in parallel, they usually have equal emfs
and the terminal voltage is equal to the emf minus the equivalent internal resistance times the current, where the
equivalent internal resistance is smaller than the individual internal resistances. Batteries are connected in series to
increase the terminal voltage to the load. Batteries are connected in parallel to increase the current to the load.

Solar Cell Arrays

Another example dealing with multiple voltage sources is that of combinations of solar cells--wired in both series
and parallel combinations to yield a desired voltage and current. Photovoltaic generation, which is the conversion of
sunlight directly into electricity, is based upon the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect is beyond the scope
of this chapter and is covered in Photons and Matter Waves (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-
volume-3/pages/6-introduction), but in general, photons hitting the surface of a solar cell create an electric current
in the cell.

Most solar cells are made from pure silicon. Most single cells have a voltage output of about 0.5 V, while the current

output is a function of the amount of sunlight falling on the cell (the incident solar radiation known as the insolation).

Under bright noon sunlight, a current per unit area of about  of cell surface area is produced by typical

single-crystal cells.

Individual solar cells are connected electrically in modules to meet electrical energy needs. They can be wired
together in series or in parallel--connected like the batteries discussed earlier. A solar-cell array or module usually
consists of between 36 and 72 cells, with a power output of 50 W to 140 W.

Solar cells, like batteries, provide a direct current (dc) voltage. Current from a dc voltage source is unidirectional.
Most household appliances need an alternating current (ac) voltage.

10.4 Electrical Measuring Instruments

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe how to connect a voltmeter in a circuit to measure voltage
    · Describe how to connect an ammeter in a circuit to measure current
    · Describe the use of an ohmmeter

Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's method are useful to analyze and design electrical circuits, providing you with the
voltages across, the current through, and the resistance of the components that compose the circuit. To measure
these parameters require instruments, and these instruments are described in this section.

DC Voltmeters and Ammeters

Whereas voltmeters measure voltage, ammeters measure current. Some of the meters in automobile dashboards,
digital cameras, cell phones, and tuner-amplifiers are actually voltmeters or ammeters (Figure 10.34). The internal
construction of the simplest of these meters and how they are connected to the system they monitor give further
insight into applications of series and parallel connections.

     FIGURE 10.34 The fuel and temperature gauges (far right and far left, respectively) in this 1996 Volkswagen are voltmeters that register
     the voltage output of "sender" units. These units are proportional to the amount of gasoline in the tank and to the engine temperature.
     (credit: Christian Giersing)

     Measuring Current with an Ammeter

     To measure the current through a device or component, the ammeter is placed in series with the device or
     component. A series connection is used because objects in series have the same current passing through them.
     (See Figure 10.35, where the ammeter is represented by the symbol A.)

     FIGURE 10.35 (a) When an ammeter is used to measure the current through two resistors connected in series to a battery, a single
     ammeter is placed in series with the two resistors because the current is the same through the two resistors in series. (b) When two
     resistors are connected in parallel with a battery, three meters, or three separate ammeter readings, are necessary to measure the current
     from the battery and through each resistor. The ammeter is connected in series with the component in question.

     Ammeters need to have a very low resistance, a fraction of a milliohm. If the resistance is not negligible, placing the
     ammeter in the circuit would change the equivalent resistance of the circuit and modify the current that is being
     measured. Since the current in the circuit travels through the meter, ammeters normally contain a fuse to protect
     the meter from damage from currents which are too high.

     Measuring Voltage with a Voltmeter

     A voltmeter is connected in parallel with whatever device it is measuring. A parallel connection is used because
     objects in parallel experience the same potential difference. (See Figure 10.36, where the voltmeter is represented

FIGURE 10.36 To measure potential differences in this series circuit, the voltmeter (V) is placed in parallel with the voltage source or either
of the resistors. Note that terminal voltage is measured between the positive terminal and the negative terminal of the battery or voltage
source. It is not possible to connect a voltmeter directly across the emf without including the internal resistance r of the battery.

Since voltmeters are connected in parallel, the voltmeter must have a very large resistance. Digital voltmeters

convert the analog voltage into a digital value to display on a digital readout (Figure 10.37). Inexpensive voltmeters

have resistances on the order of  whereas high-precision voltmeters have resistances on the order of

Analog and Digital Meters

You may encounter two types of meters in the physics lab: analog and digital. The term `analog' refers to signals or
information represented by a continuously variable physical quantity, such as voltage or current. An analog meter
uses a galvanometer, which is essentially a coil of wire with a small resistance, in a magnetic field, with a pointer
attached that points to a scale. Current flows through the coil, causing the coil to rotate. To use the galvanometer as
an ammeter, a small resistance is placed in parallel with the coil. For a voltmeter, a large resistance is placed in
series with the coil. A digital meter uses a component called an analog-to-digital (A to D) converter and expresses
the current or voltage as a series of the digits 0 and 1, which are used to run a digital display. Most analog meters
have been replaced by digital meters.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 10.8

Digital meters are able to detect smaller currents than analog meters employing galvanometers. How does this
explain their ability to measure voltage and current more accurately than analog meters?

     Ohmmeters

     An ohmmeter is an instrument used to measure the resistance of a component or device. The operation of the

     ohmmeter is based on Ohm's law. Traditional ohmmeters contained an internal voltage source (such as a battery)

     that would be connected across the component to be tested, producing a current through the component. A

     galvanometer was then used to measure the current and the resistance was deduced using Ohm's law. Modern

     digital meters use a constant current source to pass current through the component, and the voltage difference

     across the component is measured. In either case, the resistance is measured using Ohm's law             where

     the voltage is known and the current is measured, or the current is known and the voltage is measured.

     The component of interest should be isolated from the circuit; otherwise, you will be measuring the equivalent
     resistance of the circuit. An ohmmeter should never be connected to a "live" circuit, one with a voltage source
     connected to it and current running through it. Doing so can damage the meter.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the charging process of a capacitor
         · Describe the discharging process of a capacitor
         · List some applications of RC circuits

     When you use a flash camera, it takes a few seconds to charge the capacitor that powers the flash. The light flash
     discharges the capacitor in a tiny fraction of a second. Why does charging take longer than discharging? This
     question and several other phenomena that involve charging and discharging capacitors are discussed in this
     module.

     Circuits with Resistance and Capacitance

     An RC circuit is a circuit containing resistance and capacitance. As presented in Capacitance, the capacitor is an
     electrical component that stores electric charge, storing energy in an electric field.

     Figure 10.38(a) shows a simple RC circuit that employs a dc (direct current) voltage source , a resistor R, a
     capacitor C, and a two-position switch. The circuit allows the capacitor to be charged or discharged, depending on
     the position of the switch. When the switch is moved to position A, the capacitor charges, resulting in the circuit in
     part (b). When the switch is moved to position B, the capacitor discharges through the resistor.

Charging a Capacitor

We can use Kirchhoff's loop rule to understand the charging of the capacitor. This results in the equation

                  This equation can be used to model the charge as a function of time as the capacitor charges.

Capacitance is defined as    so the voltage across the capacitor is  . Using Ohm's law, the potential

drop across the resistor is  , and the current is defined as

This differential equation can be integrated to find an equation for the charge on the capacitor as a function of time.

Let               , then     The result is

Simplifying results in an equation for the charge on the charging capacitor as a function of time:

                                                                                                            10.8

A graph of the charge on the capacitor versus time is shown in Figure 10.39(a). First note that as time approaches

infinity, the exponential goes to zero, so the charge approaches the maximum charge  and has units of

coulombs. The units of RC are seconds, units of time. This quantity is known as the time constant:

                                                                                                            10.9

At time           , the charge is equal to                           of the maximum charge                  . Notice

that the time rate change of the charge is the slope at a point of the charge versus time plot. The slope of the graph

is large at time          and approaches zero as time increases.

As the charge on the capacitor increases, the current through the resistor decreases, as shown in Figure 10.39(b).
The current through the resistor can be found by taking the time derivative of the charge.
442  10 · Direct-Current Circuits

     At time        the current through the resistor is                                                                      10.10

     Figure 10.39(c) and Figure 10.39(d) show the voltage differences across the capacitor and the resistor, respectively.

     As the charge on the capacitor increases, the current decreases, as does the voltage difference across the

     resistor                         The voltage difference across the capacitor increases

     Discharging a Capacitor

     When the switch in Figure 10.38(a) is moved to position B, the circuit reduces to the circuit in part (c), and the
     charged capacitor is allowed to discharge through the resistor. A graph of the charge on the capacitor as a function
     of time is shown in Figure 10.40(a). Using Kirchhoff's loop rule to analyze the circuit as the capacitor discharges

     results in the equation          , which simplifies to  . Using the definition of current

     and integrating the loop equation yields an equation for the charge on the capacitor as a function of time:

                                                                                                                  10.11

Here, Q is the initial charge on the capacitor and  is the time constant of the circuit. As shown in the graph,

the charge decreases exponentially from the initial charge, approaching zero as time approaches infinity.

The current as a function of time can be found by taking the time derivative of the charge:

                                                                                                           10.12

The negative sign shows that the current flows in the opposite direction of the current found when the capacitor is
charging. Figure 10.40(b) shows an example of a plot of charge versus time and current versus time. A plot of the
voltage difference across the capacitor and the voltage difference across the resistor as a function of time are shown
in parts (c) and (d) of the figure. Note that the magnitudes of the charge, current, and voltage all decrease
exponentially, approaching zero as time increases.

FIGURE 10.40 (a) Charge on the capacitor versus time as the capacitor discharges. (b) Current through the resistor versus time. (c) Voltage
difference across the capacitor. (d) Voltage difference across the resistor.

Now we can explain why the flash camera mentioned at the beginning of this section takes so much longer to charge
than discharge: The resistance while charging is significantly greater than while discharging. The internal resistance
of the battery accounts for most of the resistance while charging. As the battery ages, the increasing internal
resistance makes the charging process even slower.

        EXAMPLE 10.8

The Relaxation Oscillator

One application of an RC circuit is the relaxation oscillator, as shown below. The relaxation oscillator consists of a
voltage source, a resistor, a capacitor, and a neon lamp. The neon lamp acts like an open circuit (infinite resistance)
until the potential difference across the neon lamp reaches a specific voltage. At that voltage, the lamp acts like a
short circuit (zero resistance), and the capacitor discharges through the neon lamp and produces light. In the
relaxation oscillator shown, the voltage source charges the capacitor until the voltage across the capacitor is 80 V.
444  10 · Direct-Current Circuits

     When this happens, the neon in the lamp breaks down and allows the capacitor to discharge through the lamp,
     producing a bright flash. After the capacitor fully discharges through the neon lamp, it begins to charge again, and
     the process repeats. Assuming that the time it takes the capacitor to discharge is negligible, what is the time interval
     between flashes?

     Strategy                                                    where
     The time period can be found from considering the equation

     Solution
     The neon lamp flashes when the voltage across the capacitor reaches 80 V. The RC time constant is equal to

                                                                           We can solve the voltage equation for the time it takes the
     capacitor to reach 80 V:

     Significance
     One application of the relaxation oscillator is for controlling indicator lights that flash at a frequency determined by
     the values for R and C. In this example, the neon lamp will flash every 8.13 seconds, a frequency of

                                             The relaxation oscillator has many other practical uses. It is often used in electronic
     circuits, where the neon lamp is replaced by a transistor or a device known as a tunnel diode. The description of the
     transistor and tunnel diode is beyond the scope of this chapter, but you can think of them as voltage controlled
     switches. They are normally open switches, but when the right voltage is applied, the switch closes and conducts.
     The "switch" can be used to turn on another circuit, turn on a light, or run a small motor. A relaxation oscillator can
     be used to make the turn signals of your car blink or your cell phone to vibrate.

     RC circuits have many applications. They can be used effectively as timers for applications such as intermittent
     windshield wipers, pace makers, and strobe lights. Some models of intermittent windshield wipers use a variable
     resistor to adjust the interval between sweeps of the wiper. Increasing the resistance increases the RC time
     constant, which increases the time between the operation of the wipers.

     Another application is the pacemaker. The heart rate is normally controlled by electrical signals, which cause the
     muscles of the heart to contract and pump blood. When the heart rhythm is abnormal (the heartbeat is too high or
     too low), pace makers can be used to correct this abnormality. Pacemakers have sensors that detect body motion
     and breathing to increase the heart rate during physical activities, thus meeting the increased need for blood and
     oxygen, and an RC timing circuit can be used to control the time between voltage signals to the heart.

     Looking ahead to the study of ac circuits (Alternating-Current Circuits), ac voltages vary as sine functions with

specific frequencies. Periodic variations in voltage, or electric signals, are often recorded by scientists. These voltage
signals could come from music recorded by a microphone or atmospheric data collected by radar. Occasionally,
these signals can contain unwanted frequencies known as "noise." RC filters can be used to filter out the unwanted
frequencies.

In the study of electronics, a popular device known as a 555 timer provides timed voltage pulses. The time between
pulses is controlled by an RC circuit. These are just a few of the countless applications of RC circuits.

EXAMPLE 10.9

Intermittent Windshield Wipers

A relaxation oscillator is used to control a pair of windshield wipers. The relaxation oscillator consists of a 10.00-mF

capacitor and a  variable resistor known as a rheostat. A knob connected to the variable resistor allows the

resistance to be adjusted from         to  The output of the capacitor is used to control a voltage-

controlled switch. The switch is normally open, but when the output voltage reaches 10.00 V, the switch closes,

energizing an electric motor and discharging the capacitor. The motor causes the windshield wipers to sweep once

across the windshield and the capacitor begins to charge again. To what resistance should the rheostat be adjusted

for the period of the wiper blades be 10.00 seconds?

Strategy

The resistance considers the equation                 where  The capacitance, output voltage,

Solution
The output voltage will be 10.00 V and the voltage of the battery is 12.00 V. The capacitance is given as 10.00 mF.
Solving for the resistance yields

     10.6 Household Wiring and Electrical Safety

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · List the basic concepts involved in house wiring
         · Define the terms thermal hazard and shock hazard
         · Describe the effects of electrical shock on human physiology and their relationship to the amount of

             current through the body
         · Explain the function of fuses and circuit breakers

     Electricity presents two known hazards: thermal and shock. A thermal hazard is one in which an excessive electric
     current causes undesired thermal effects, such as starting a fire in the wall of a house. A shock hazard occurs when
     an electric current passes through a person. Shocks range in severity from painful, but otherwise harmless, to heart-
     stopping lethality. In this section, we consider these hazards and the various factors affecting them in a quantitative
     manner. We also examine systems and devices for preventing electrical hazards.

     Thermal Hazards

     Electric power causes undesired heating effects whenever electric energy is converted into thermal energy at a rate
     faster than it can be safely dissipated. A classic example of this is the short circuit, a low-resistance path between
     terminals of a voltage source. An example of a short circuit is shown in Figure 10.41. A toaster is plugged into a
     common household electrical outlet. Insulation on wires leading to an appliance has worn through, allowing the two
     wires to come into contact, or "short." As a result, thermal energy can quickly raise the temperature of surrounding
     materials, melting the insulation and perhaps causing a fire.

     The circuit diagram shows a symbol that consists of a sine wave enclosed in a circle. This symbol represents an
     alternating current (ac) voltage source. In an ac voltage source, the voltage oscillates between a positive and
     negative maximum amplitude. Up to now, we have been considering direct current (dc) voltage sources, but many of
     the same concepts are applicable to ac circuits.

     FIGURE 10.41 A short circuit is an undesired low-resistance path across a voltage source. (a) Worn insulation on the wires of a toaster

     allow them to come into contact with a low resistance r. Since  , thermal power is created so rapidly that the cord melts or burns.

     (b) A schematic of the short circuit.

     Another serious thermal hazard occurs when wires supplying power to an appliance are overloaded. Electrical wires
     and appliances are often rated for the maximum current they can safely handle. The term "overloaded" refers to a
     condition where the current exceeds the rated maximum current. As current flows through a wire, the power

                                              10.6 · Household Wiring and Electrical Safety                                                   447

dissipated in the supply wires is              where is the resistance of the wires and I is the current flowing
through the wires. If either I or  is too large, the wires overheat. Fuses and circuit breakers are used to limit
excessive currents.

Shock Hazards

Electric shock is the physiological reaction or injury caused by an external electric current passing through the body.
The effect of an electric shock can be negative or positive. When a current with a magnitude above 300 mA passes
through the heart, death may occur. Most electrical shock fatalities occur because a current causes ventricular
fibrillation, a massively irregular and often fatal, beating of the heart. On the other hand, a heart attack victim,
whose heart is in fibrillation, can be saved by an electric shock from a defibrillator.

The effects of an undesirable electric shock can vary in severity: a slight sensation at the point of contact, pain, loss
of voluntary muscle control, difficulty breathing, heart fibrillation, and possibly death. The loss of voluntary muscle
control can cause the victim to not be able to let go of the source of the current.

The major factors upon which the severity of the effects of electrical shock depend are

1. The amount of current I           for dc)
2. The path taken by the current
3. The duration of the shock
4. The frequency f of the current (

Our bodies are relatively good electric conductors due to the body's water content. A dangerous condition occurs
when the body is in contact with a voltage source and "ground." The term "ground" refers to a large sink or source of
electrons, for example, the earth (thus, the name). When there is a direct path to ground, large currents will pass
through the parts of the body with the lowest resistance and a direct path to ground. A safety precaution used by
many professions is the wearing of insulated shoes. Insulated shoes prohibit a pathway to ground for electrons
through the feet by providing a large resistance. Whenever working with high-power tools, or any electric circuit,
ensure that you do not provide a pathway for current flow (especially across the heart). A common safety precaution
is to work with one hand, reducing the possibility of providing a current path through the heart.

Very small currents pass harmlessly and unfelt through the body. This happens to you regularly without your
knowledge. The threshold of sensation is only 1 mA and, although unpleasant, shocks are apparently harmless for
currents less than 5 mA. A great number of safety rules take the 5-mA value for the maximum allowed shock. At
5-30 mA and above, the current can stimulate sustained muscular contractions, much as regular nerve impulses do
(Figure 10.42). Very large currents (above 300 mA) cause the heart and diaphragm of the lung to contract for the
duration of the shock. Both the heart and respiration stop. Both often return to normal following the shock.

FIGURE 10.42 An electric current can cause muscular contractions with varying effects. (a) The victim is "thrown" backward by involuntary
muscle contractions that extend the legs and torso. (b) The victim can't let go of the wire that is stimulating all the muscles in the hand.
Those that close the fingers are stronger than those that open them.

Current is the major factor determining shock severity. A larger voltage is more hazardous, but since  the
448  10 · Direct-Current Circuits

     severity of the shock depends on the combination of voltage and resistance. For example, a person with dry skin has

     a resistance of about         . If he comes into contact with 120-V ac, a current

     passes harmlessly through him. The same person soaking wet may have a resistance of               and the same 120

     V will produce a current of 12 mA--above the "can't let go" threshold and potentially dangerous.

     Electrical Safety: Systems and Devices

     Figure 10.43(a) shows the schematic for a simple ac circuit with no safety features. This is not how power is
     distributed in practice. Modern household and industrial wiring requires the three-wire system, shown
     schematically in part (b), which has several safety features, with live, neutral, and ground wires. First is the familiar
     circuit breaker (or fuse) to prevent thermal overload. Second is a protective case around the appliance, such as a
     toaster or refrigerator. The case's safety feature is that it prevents a person from touching exposed wires and coming
     into electrical contact with the circuit, helping prevent shocks.

     FIGURE 10.43 (a) Schematic of a simple ac circuit with a voltage source and a single appliance represented by the resistance R. There are
     no safety features in this circuit. (b) The three-wire system connects the neutral wire to ground at the voltage source and user location,
     forcing it to be at zero volts and supplying an alternative return path for the current through ground. Also grounded to zero volts is the case
     of the appliance. A circuit breaker or fuse protects against thermal overload and is in series on the active (live/hot) wire.

     There are three connections to ground shown in Figure 10.43(b). Recall that a ground connection is a low-resistance
     path directly to ground. The two ground connections on the neutral wire force it to be at zero volts relative to ground,
     giving the wire its name. This wire is therefore safe to touch even if its insulation, usually white, is missing. The
     neutral wire is the return path for the current to follow to complete the circuit. Furthermore, the two ground
     connections supply an alternative path through ground (a good conductor) to complete the circuit. The ground
     connection closest to the power source could be at the generating plant, whereas the other is at the user's location.
     The third ground is to the case of the appliance, through the green ground wire, forcing the case, too, to be at zero
     volts. The live or hot wire (hereafter referred to as "live/hot") supplies voltage and current to operate the appliance.
     Figure 10.44 shows a more pictorial version of how the three-wire system is connected through a three-prong plug
     to an appliance.

      FIGURE 10.44 The standard three-prong plug can only be inserted in one way, to ensure proper function of the three-wire system.

Insulating plastic is color-coded to identify live/hot, neutral, and ground wires, but these codes vary around the
world. It is essential to determine the color code in your region. Striped coatings are sometimes used for the benefit
of those who are colorblind.

Grounding the case solves more than one problem. The simplest problem is worn insulation on the live/hot wire that
allows it to contact the case, as shown in Figure 10.45. Lacking a ground connection, a severe shock is possible. This
is particularly dangerous in the kitchen, where a good connection to ground is available through water on the floor or
a water faucet. With the ground connection intact, the circuit breaker will trip, forcing repair of the appliance.

FIGURE 10.45 Worn insulation allows the live/hot wire to come into direct contact with the metal case of this appliance. (a) The ground
connection being broken, the person is severely shocked. The appliance may operate normally in this situation. (b) With a proper ground,
the circuit breaker trips, forcing repair of the appliance.

A ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) is a safety device found in updated kitchen and bathroom wiring that works
based on electromagnetic induction. GFCIs compare the currents in the live/hot and neutral wires. When live/hot
and neutral currents are not equal, it is almost always because current in the neutral is less than in the live/hot wire.
Then some of the current, called a leakage current, is returning to the voltage source by a path other than through
the neutral wire. It is assumed that this path presents a hazard. GFCIs are usually set to interrupt the circuit if the
leakage current is greater than 5 mA, the accepted maximum harmless shock. Even if the leakage current goes

INTRODUCTION For the past few chapters, we have been studying electrostatic forces and fields, which are caused
by electric charges at rest. These electric fields can move other free charges, such as producing a current in a circuit;
however, the electrostatic forces and fields themselves come from other static charges. In this chapter, we see that
when an electric charge moves, it generates other forces and fields. These additional forces and fields are what we
commonly call magnetism.
Before we examine the origins of magnetism, we first describe what it is and how magnetic fields behave. Once we
are more familiar with magnetic effects, we can explain how they arise from the behavior of atoms and molecules,
and how magnetism is related to electricity. The connection between electricity and magnetism is fascinating from a
theoretical point of view, but it is also immensely practical, as shown by an industrial electromagnet that can lift
thousands of pounds of metal.

     11.1 Magnetism and Its Historical Discoveries

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain attraction and repulsion by magnets
         · Describe the historical and contemporary applications of magnetism

     Magnetism has been known since the time of the ancient Greeks, but it has always been a bit mysterious. You can
     see electricity in the flash of a lightning bolt, but when a compass needle points to magnetic north, you can't see any
     force causing it to rotate. People learned about magnetic properties gradually, over many years, before several
     physicists of the nineteenth century connected magnetism with electricity. In this section, we review the basic ideas
     of magnetism and describe how they fit into the picture of a magnetic field.

     Brief History of Magnetism

     Magnets are commonly found in everyday objects, such as toys, hangers, elevators, doorbells, and computer
     devices. Experimentation on these magnets shows that all magnets have two poles: One is labeled north (N) and the
     other is labeled south (S). Magnetic poles repel if they are alike (both N or both S), they attract if they are opposite
     (one N and the other S), and both poles of a magnet attract unmagnetized pieces of iron. An important point to note
     here is that you cannot isolate an individual magnetic pole. Every piece of a magnet, no matter how small, which
     contains a north pole must also contain a south pole.

          INTERACTIVE

     Visit this website (https://openstax.org/l/21magnetcompass) for an interactive demonstration of magnetic north and
     south poles.

     An example of a magnet is a compass needle. It is simply a thin bar magnet suspended at its center, so it is free to
     rotate in a horizontal plane. Earth itself also acts like a very large bar magnet, with its south-seeking pole near the
     geographic North Pole (Figure 11.2). The north pole of a compass is attracted toward Earth's geographic North Pole
     because the magnetic pole that is near the geographic North Pole is actually a south magnetic pole. Confusion arises
     because the geographic term "North Pole" has come to be used (incorrectly) for the magnetic pole that is near the
     North Pole. Thus, "north magnetic pole" is actually a misnomer--it should be called the south magnetic pole. [Note
     that the orientation of Earth's magnetic field is not permanent but changes ("flips") after long time intervals.
     Eventually, Earth's north magnetic pole may be located near its geographic North Pole.]

     FIGURE 11.2 The north pole of a compass needle points toward the south pole of a magnet, which is how today's magnetic field is oriented
     from inside Earth. It also points toward Earth's geographic North Pole because the geographic North Pole is near the magnetic south pole.

Back in 1819, the Danish physicist Hans Oersted was performing a lecture demonstration for some students and
noticed that a compass needle moved whenever current flowed in a nearby wire. Further investigation of this
phenomenon convinced Oersted that an electric current could somehow cause a magnetic force. He reported this
finding to an 1820 meeting of the French Academy of Science.

Soon after this report, Oersted's investigations were repeated and expanded upon by other scientists. Among those
whose work was especially important were Jean-Baptiste Biot and Felix Savart, who investigated the forces exerted
on magnets by currents; André Marie Ampère, who studied the forces exerted by one current on another; François
Arago, who found that iron could be magnetized by a current; and Humphry Davy, who discovered that a magnet
exerts a force on a wire carrying an electric current. Within 10 years of Oersted's discovery, Michael Faraday found
that the relative motion of a magnet and a metallic wire induced current in the wire. This finding showed not only
that a current has a magnetic effect, but that a magnet can generate electric current. You will see later that the
names of Biot, Savart, Ampère, and Faraday are linked to some of the fundamental laws of electromagnetism.

The evidence from these various experiments led Ampère to propose that electric current is the source of all
magnetic phenomena. To explain permanent magnets, he suggested that matter contains microscopic current loops
that are somehow aligned when a material is magnetized. Today, we know that permanent magnets are actually
created by the alignment of spinning electrons, a situation quite similar to that proposed by Ampère. This model of
permanent magnets was developed by Ampère almost a century before the atomic nature of matter was
understood. (For a full quantum mechanical treatment of magnetic spins, see Quantum Mechanics

Contemporary Applications of Magnetism

Today, magnetism plays many important roles in our lives. Physicists' understanding of magnetism has enabled the
development of technologies that affect both individuals and society. The electronic tablet in your purse or
backpack, for example, wouldn't have been possible without the applications of magnetism and electricity on a
small scale (Figure 11.3). Weak changes in a magnetic field in a thin film of iron and chromium were discovered to
bring about much larger changes in resistance, called giant magnetoresistance. Information can then be recorded
magnetically based on the direction in which the iron layer is magnetized. As a result of the discovery of giant
magnetoresistance and its applications to digital storage, the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Albert
Fert from France and Peter Grunberg from Germany.

Klaus Eifert)

All electric motors--with uses as diverse as powering refrigerators, starting cars, and moving elevators--contain
magnets. Generators, whether producing hydroelectric power or running bicycle lights, use magnetic fields.
Recycling facilities employ magnets to separate iron from other refuse. Research into using magnetic containment
of fusion as a future energy source has been continuing for several years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has
become an important diagnostic tool in the field of medicine, and the use of magnetism to explore brain activity is a
subject of contemporary research and development. The list of applications also includes computer hard drives,
tape recording, detection of inhaled asbestos, and levitation of high-speed trains. Magnetism is involved in the
466  11 · Magnetic Forces and Fields

     structure of atomic energy levels, as well as the motion of cosmic rays and charged particles trapped in the Van
     Allen belts around Earth. Once again, we see that all these disparate phenomena are linked by a small number of
     underlying physical principles.

     11.2 Magnetic Fields and Lines

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define the magnetic field based on a moving charge experiencing a force
         · Apply the right-hand rule to determine the direction of a magnetic force based on the motion of a charge

             in a magnetic field
         · Sketch magnetic field lines to understand which way the magnetic field points and how strong it is in a

             region of space

     We have outlined the properties of magnets, described how they behave, and listed some of the applications of
     magnetic properties. Even though there are no such things as isolated magnetic charges, we can still define the
     attraction and repulsion of magnets as based on a field. In this section, we define the magnetic field, determine its
     direction based on the right-hand rule, and discuss how to draw magnetic field lines.

     Defining the Magnetic Field

     A magnetic field is defined by the force that a charged particle experiences moving in this field, after we account for
     the gravitational and any additional electric forces possible on the charge. The magnitude of this force is
     proportional to the amount of charge q, the speed of the charged particle v, and the magnitude of the applied
     magnetic field. The direction of this force is perpendicular to both the direction of the moving charged particle and
     the direction of the applied magnetic field. Based on these observations, we define the magnetic field strength B
     based on the magnetic force on a charge q moving at velocity as the cross product of the velocity and magnetic
     field, that is,

                                                                                                                                                          11.1

     In fact, this is how we define the magnetic field --in terms of the force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic
     field. The magnitude of the force is determined from the definition of the cross product as it relates to the
     magnitudes of each of the vectors. In other words, the magnitude of the force satisfies

                                                                                                                                                          11.2

     where  is the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field.
     The SI unit for magnetic field strength B is called the tesla (T) after the eccentric but brilliant inventor Nikola Tesla
     (1856-1943), where

                                                                                                                                                          11.3

     A smaller unit, called the gauss (G), where  is sometimes used. The strongest permanent magnets

     have fields near 2 T; superconducting electromagnets may attain 10 T or more. Earth's magnetic field on its surface

     is only about  or 0.5 G.

There is no magnetic force on static charges. However, there is a magnetic force on charges moving at an angle to a
magnetic field. When charges are stationary, their electric fields do not affect magnets. However, when charges
move, they produce magnetic fields that exert forces on other magnets. When there is relative motion, a connection
between electric and magnetic forces emerges--each affects the other.

An Alpha-Particle Moving in a Magnetic Field

An alpha-particle                     moves through a uniform magnetic field whose magnitude is 1.5 T. The field

     FIGURE 11.5 The magnetic forces on an alpha-particle moving in a uniform magnetic field. The field is the same in each drawing, but the
     velocity is different.

     Strategy

     We are given the charge, its velocity, and the magnetic field strength and direction. We can thus use the equation

               or                     to calculate the force. The direction of the force is determined by RHR-1.

     Solution

     a. First, to determine the direction, start with your fingers pointing in the positive x-direction. Sweep your fingers
          upward in the direction of magnetic field. Your thumb should point in the negative y-direction. This should
          match the mathematical answer. To calculate the force, we use the given charge, velocity, and magnetic field
          and the definition of the magnetic force in cross-product form to calculate:

     b. First, to determine the directionality, start with your fingers pointing in the negative y-direction. Sweep your
          fingers upward in the direction of magnetic field as in the previous problem. Your thumb should be open in the
          negative x-direction. This should match the mathematical answer. To calculate the force, we use the given
          charge, velocity, and magnetic field and the definition of the magnetic force in cross-product form to calculate:

     An alternative approach is to use Equation 11.2 to find the magnitude of the force. This applies for both parts
     (a) and (b). Since the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the angle between them is 90 degrees.
     Therefore, the magnitude of the force is:

     c. Since the velocity and magnetic field are parallel to each other, there is no orientation of your hand that will

                                                                                   11.2 · Magnetic Fields and Lines        469

     result in a force direction. Therefore, the force on this moving charge is zero. This is confirmed by the cross
     product. When you cross two vectors pointing in the same direction, the result is equal to zero.
d. First, to determine the direction, your fingers could point in any orientation; however, you must sweep your
     fingers upward in the direction of the magnetic field. As you rotate your hand, notice that the thumb can point
     in any x- or y-direction possible, but not in the z-direction. This should match the mathematical answer. To
     calculate the force, we use the given charge, velocity, and magnetic field and the definition of the magnetic
     force in cross-product form to calculate:

This solution can be rewritten in terms of a magnitude and angle in the xy-plane:

        The magnitude of the force can also be calculated using Equation 11.2. The velocity in this question, however,
       has three components. The z-component of the velocity can be neglected, because it is parallel to the
       magnetic field and therefore generates no force. The magnitude of the velocity is calculated from the x- and
       y-components. The angle between the velocity in the xy-plane and the magnetic field in the z-plane is 90
        degrees. Therefore, the force is calculated to be:

        This is the same magnitude of force calculated by unit vectors.

Significance
The cross product in this formula results in a third vector that must be perpendicular to the other two. Other
physical quantities, such as angular momentum, also have three vectors that are related by the cross product. Note
that typical force values in magnetic force problems are much larger than the gravitational force. Therefore, for an
isolated charge, the magnetic force is the dominant force governing the charge's motion.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 11.1

Repeat the previous problem with the magnetic field in the x-direction rather than in the z-direction. Check your
answers with RHR-1.

Representing Magnetic Fields

The representation of magnetic fields by magnetic field lines is very useful in visualizing the strength and direction
of the magnetic field. As shown in Figure 11.6, each of these lines forms a closed loop, even if not shown by the
constraints of the space available for the figure. The field lines emerge from the north pole (N), loop around to the
south pole (S), and continue through the bar magnet back to the north pole.
Magnetic field lines have several hard-and-fast rules:

  1. The direction of the magnetic field is tangent to the field line at any point in space. A small compass will point
        in the direction of the field line.

  2. The strength of the field is proportional to the closeness of the lines. It is exactly proportional to the number of
        lines per unit area perpendicular to the lines (called the areal density).

  3. Magnetic field lines can never cross, meaning that the field is unique at any point in space.
  4. Magnetic field lines are continuous, forming closed loops without a beginning or end. They are directed from

        the north pole to the south pole.
470  11 · Magnetic Forces and Fields

     The last property is related to the fact that the north and south poles cannot be separated. It is a distinct difference
     from electric field lines, which generally begin on positive charges and end on negative charges or at infinity. If
     isolated magnetic charges (referred to as magnetic monopoles) existed, then magnetic field lines would begin and
     end on them.

     FIGURE 11.6 Magnetic field lines are defined to have the direction in which a small compass points when placed at a location in the field.
     The strength of the field is proportional to the closeness (or density) of the lines. Magnetic field lines present inside the magnet or outside
     the field of view are not shown given the space constraints of the figure. If the rest of the magnetic field line was shown, it would form a
     continuous loop.

     11.3 Motion of a Charged Particle in a Magnetic Field

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how a charged particle in an external magnetic field undergoes circular motion
         · Describe how to determine the radius of the circular motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field

     A charged particle experiences a force when moving through a magnetic field. What happens if this field is uniform
     over the motion of the charged particle? What path does the particle follow? In this section, we discuss the circular
     motion of the charged particle as well as other motion that results from a charged particle entering a magnetic field.

     The simplest case occurs when a charged particle moves perpendicular to a uniform B-field (Figure 11.7). If the field
     is in a vacuum, the magnetic field is the dominant factor determining the motion. Since the magnetic force is
     perpendicular to the direction of travel, a charged particle follows a curved path in a magnetic field. The particle
     continues to follow this curved path until it forms a complete circle. Another way to look at this is that the magnetic
     force is always perpendicular to velocity, so that it does no work on the charged particle. The particle's kinetic
     energy and speed thus remain constant. The direction of motion is affected but not the speed.

FIGURE 11.7 A negatively charged particle moves in the plane of the paper in a region where the magnetic field is perpendicular to the
paper (represented by the small 's--like the tails of arrows). The magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity, so velocity changes in
direction but not magnitude. The result is uniform circular motion. (Note that because the charge is negative, the force is opposite in
direction to the prediction of the right-hand rule.)

In this situation, the magnetic force supplies the centripetal force  Noting that the velocity is

perpendicular to the magnetic field, the magnitude of the magnetic force is reduced to  Because the

magnetic force F supplies the centripetal force we have

                                                                                                     11.4

Solving for r yields

                                                                                                     11.5

Here, r is the radius of curvature of the path of a charged particle with mass m and charge q, moving at a speed v
that is perpendicular to a magnetic field of strength B. The time for the charged particle to go around the circular
path is defined as the period, which is the same as the distance traveled (the circumference) divided by the speed.
Based on this and Equation 11.4, we can derive the period of motion as

                                                                                                                                                     11.6

If the velocity is not perpendicular to the magnetic field, then we can compare each component of the velocity
separately with the magnetic field. The component of the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field produces a
magnetic force perpendicular to both this velocity and the field:

                                                                                                                                                     11.7

where is the angle between v and B. The component parallel to the magnetic field creates constant motion along
the same direction as the magnetic field, also shown in Equation 11.7. The parallel motion determines the pitch p of
the helix, which is the distance between adjacent turns. This distance equals the parallel component of the velocity
times the period:

                                                                                                                                                     11.8

The result is a helical motion, as shown in the following figure.

     FIGURE 11.8 A charged particle moving with a velocity not in the same direction as the magnetic field. The velocity component
     perpendicular to the magnetic field creates circular motion, whereas the component of the velocity parallel to the field moves the particle
     along a straight line. The pitch is the horizontal distance between two consecutive circles. The resulting motion is helical.

     While the charged particle travels in a helical path, it may enter a region where the magnetic field is not uniform. In
     particular, suppose a particle travels from a region of strong magnetic field to a region of weaker field, then back to a
     region of stronger field. The particle may reflect back before entering the stronger magnetic field region. This is
     similar to a wave on a string traveling from a very light, thin string to a hard wall and reflecting backward. If the
     reflection happens at both ends, the particle is trapped in a so-called magnetic bottle.
     Trapped particles in magnetic fields are found in the Van Allen radiation belts around Earth, which are part of Earth's
     magnetic field. These belts were discovered by James Van Allen while trying to measure the flux of cosmic rays on
     Earth (high-energy particles that come from outside the solar system) to see whether this was similar to the flux
     measured on Earth. Van Allen found that due to the contribution of particles trapped in Earth's magnetic field, the
     flux was much higher on Earth than in outer space. Aurorae, like the famous aurora borealis (northern lights) in the
     Northern Hemisphere (Figure 11.9), are beautiful displays of light emitted as ions recombine with electrons entering
     the atmosphere as they spiral along magnetic field lines. (The ions are primarily oxygen and nitrogen atoms that are
     initially ionized by collisions with energetic particles in Earth's atmosphere.) Aurorae have also been observed on
     other planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn.

EXAMPLE 11.2

Beam Deflector

A research group is investigating short-lived radioactive isotopes. They need to design a way to transport alpha-

particles (helium nuclei) from where they are made to a place where they will collide with another material to form

an isotope. The beam of alpha-particles  bends through a 90-degree

region with a uniform magnetic field of 0.050 T (Figure 11.10). (a) In what direction should the magnetic field be

applied? (b) How much time does it take the alpha-particles to traverse the uniform magnetic field region?

                                                          FIGURE 11.10 Top view of the beam deflector setup.

Strategy
  a. The direction of the magnetic field is shown by the RHR-1. Your fingers point in the direction of v, and your
        thumb needs to point in the direction of the force, to the left. Therefore, since the alpha-particles are
        positively charged, the magnetic field must point down.
  b. The period of the alpha-particle going around the circle is
                                                                                                                                                     11.9

        Because the particle is only going around a quarter of a circle, we can take 0.25 times the period to find the
        time it takes to go around this path.
Solution
  a. Let's start by focusing on the alpha-particle entering the field near the bottom of the picture. First, point your
        thumb up the page. In order for your palm to open to the left where the centripetal force (and hence the
        magnetic force) points, your fingers need to change orientation until they point into the page. This is the
        direction of the applied magnetic field.
  b. The period of the charged particle going around a circle is calculated by using the given mass, charge, and
        magnetic field in the problem. This works out to be

        However, for the given problem, the alpha-particle goes around a quarter of the circle, so the time it takes
        would be
474  11 · Magnetic Forces and Fields

     Significance

     This time may be quick enough to get to the material we would like to bombard, depending on how short-lived the
     radioactive isotope is and continues to emit alpha-particles. If we could increase the magnetic field applied in the
     region, this would shorten the time even more. The path the particles need to take could be shortened, but this may
     not be economical given the experimental setup.

     magnetic field be from the velocity so that the pitch of the resulting helical motion is equal to the radius of the helix?

     Strategy

     The pitch of the motion relates to the parallel velocity times the period of the circular motion, whereas the radius
     relates to the perpendicular velocity component. After setting the radius and the pitch equal to each other, solve for
     the angle between the magnetic field and velocity or

     Solution

     The pitch is given by Equation 11.8, the period is given by Equation 11.6, and the radius of circular motion is given
     by Equation 11.5. Note that the velocity in the radius equation is related to only the perpendicular velocity, which is
     where the circular motion occurs. Therefore, we substitute the sine component of the overall velocity into the radius
     equation to equate the pitch and radius:

     Significance
     If this angle were only parallel velocity would occur and the helix would not form, because there would be no
     circular motion in the perpendicular plane. If this angle were only circular motion would occur and there would
     be no movement of the circles perpendicular to the motion. That is what creates the helical motion.

Magnetic Fields Produced by Electrical Currents

When discussing historical discoveries in magnetism, we mentioned Oersted's finding that a wire carrying an
electrical current caused a nearby compass to deflect. A connection was established that electrical currents
produce magnetic fields. (This connection between electricity and magnetism is discussed in more detail in Sources
of Magnetic Fields.)

The compass needle near the wire experiences a force that aligns the needle tangent to a circle around the wire.
Therefore, a current-carrying wire produces circular loops of magnetic field. To determine the direction of the
magnetic field generated from a wire, we use a second right-hand rule. In RHR-2, your thumb points in the direction
of the current while your fingers wrap around the wire, pointing in the direction of the magnetic field produced
(Figure 11.11). If the magnetic field were coming at you or out of the page, we represent this with a dot. If the
magnetic field were going into the page, we represent this with an These symbols come from considering a vector
arrow: An arrow pointed toward you, from your perspective, would look like a dot or the tip of an arrow. An arrow
pointed away from you, from your perspective, would look like a cross or an A composite sketch of the magnetic
circles is shown in Figure 11.11, where the field strength is shown to decrease as you get farther from the wire by
loops that are farther separated.

pointing inward (like the tail of an arrow) and the field pointing outward (like the tip of an arrow). (b) A long and straight wire creates a field
with magnetic field lines forming circular loops.

Calculating the Magnetic Force

Electric current is an ordered movement of charge. A current-carrying wire in a magnetic field must therefore

experience a force due to the field. To investigate this force, let's consider the infinitesimal section of wire as shown

in Figure 11.12. The length and cross-sectional area of the section are dl and A, respectively, so its volume is

The wire is formed from material that contains n charge carriers per unit volume, so the number of

charge carriers in the section is  If the charge carriers move with drift velocity the current I in the wire is

(from Current and Resistance)

The magnetic force on any single charge carrier is  so the total magnetic force on the                   charge
carriers in the section of wire is                                                                           11.10

We can define dl to be a vector of length dl pointing along which allows us to rewrite this equation as

     This is the magnetic force on the section of wire. Note that it is actually the net force exerted by the field on the
     charge carriers themselves. The direction of this force is given by RHR-1, where you point your fingers in the
     direction of the current and curl them toward the field. Your thumb then points in the direction of the force.

on the wire? (b) If a constant magnetic field of 0.30 T is directed 30 degrees from the +x-axis towards the +y-axis,
what is the magnetic force per unit length on the wire?

Strategy

The magnetic force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field is given by     For part a, since the

current and magnetic field are perpendicular in this problem, we can simplify the formula to give us the magnitude

and find the direction through the RHR-1. The angle  is 90 degrees, which means   Also, the length can be

divided over to the left-hand side to find the force per unit length. For part b, the current times length is written in

unit vector notation, as well as the magnetic field. After the cross product is taken, the directionality is evident by

the resulting unit vector.

Solution

a. We start with the general formula for the magnetic force on a wire. We are looking for the force per unit length,

       so we divide by the length to bring it to the left-hand side. We also set  The solution therefore is

       Directionality: Point your fingers in the positive y-direction and curl your fingers in the positive x-direction.
        Your thumb will point in the direction. Therefore, with directionality, the solution is

  b. The current times length and the magnetic field are written in unit vector notation. Then, we take the cross

Significance
This large magnetic field creates a significant force on a small length of wire. As the angle of the magnetic field
becomes more closely aligned to the current in the wire, there is less of a force on it, as seen from comparing parts a

     Strategy
     The magnetic force on the upper loop should be written in terms of the differential force acting on each segment of
     the loop. If we integrate over each differential piece, we solve for the overall force on that section of the loop. The
     force on the lower loop is found in a similar manner, and the total force is the addition of these two forces.

     A differential force on an arbitrary piece of wire located on the upper ring is:
     where is the angle between the magnetic field direction (+y) and the segment of wire. A differential segment is
     located at the same radius, so using an arc-length formula, we have:

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Evaluate the net force on a current loop in an external magnetic field
    · Evaluate the net torque on a current loop in an external magnetic field
    · Define the magnetic dipole moment of a current loop

Motors are the most common application of magnetic force on current-carrying wires. Motors contain loops of wire
in a magnetic field. When current is passed through the loops, the magnetic field exerts torque on the loops, which
rotates a shaft. Electrical energy is converted into mechanical work in the process. Once the loop's surface area is
aligned with the magnetic field, the direction of current is reversed, so there is a continual torque on the loop (Figure
11.15). This reversal of the current is done with commutators and brushes. The commutator is set to reverse the
current flow at set points to keep continual motion in the motor. A basic commutator has three contact areas to
avoid and dead spots where the loop would have zero instantaneous torque at that point. The brushes press against
the commutator, creating electrical contact between parts of the commutator during the spinning motion.

FIGURE 11.15 A simplified version of a dc electric motor. (a) The rectangular wire loop is placed in a magnetic field. The forces on the wires
closest to the magnetic poles (N and S) are opposite in direction as determined by the right-hand rule-1. Therefore, the loop has a net
torque and rotates to the position shown in (b). (b) The brushes now touch the commutator segments so that no current flows through the
loop. No torque acts on the loop, but the loop continues to spin from the initial velocity given to it in part (a). By the time the loop flips over,
current flows through the wires again but now in the opposite direction, and the process repeats as in part (a). This causes continual
rotation of the loop.

In a uniform magnetic field, a current-carrying loop of wire, such as a loop in a motor, experiences both forces and
torques on the loop. Figure 11.16 shows a rectangular loop of wire that carries a current I and has sides of lengths a

and b. The loop is in a uniform magnetic field:  The magnetic force on a straight current-carrying wire of

length l is given by           To find the net force on the loop, we have to apply this equation to each of the four

sides. The force on side 1 is

where the direction has been determined with the RHR-1. The current in side 3 flows in the opposite direction to
that of side 1, so

                                                                                                                                                   11.15

     We can now find the net force on the loop:

                                                                                                                        11.17

     Although this result             has been obtained for a rectangular loop, it is far more general and holds for current-

     carrying loops of arbitrary shapes; that is, there is no net force on a current loop in a uniform magnetic field.

     FIGURE 11.16 (a) A rectangular current loop in a uniform magnetic field is subjected to a net torque but not a net force. (b) A side view of
     the coil.

     To find the net torque on the current loop shown in Figure 11.16, we first consider and Since they have the

     same line of action and are equal and opposite, the sum of their torques about any axis is zero (see Fixed-Axis

     Rotation (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/10-introduction)). Thus, if there is any

     torque on the loop, it must be furnished by and Let's calculate the torques around the axis that passes

     through point O of Figure 11.16 (a side view of the coil) and is perpendicular to the plane of the page. The point O is

     a distance x from side 2 and a distance     from side 4 of the loop. The moment arms of and are

     and                 respectively, so the net torque on the loop is

                                                                                                                        11.18

     This simplifies to

                                                                                                                        11.19

     where  is the area of the loop.

     Notice that this torque is independent of x; it is therefore independent of where point O is located in the plane of the
     current loop. Consequently, the loop experiences the same torque from the magnetic field about any axis in the
     plane of the loop and parallel to the x-axis.

moment? (b) If the dipole is oriented at 30 degrees to a uniform magnetic field of magnitude 0.50 T, what is the
magnitude of the torque it experiences and what is its potential energy?

Strategy
The dipole moment is defined by the current times the area of the loop. The area of the loop can be calculated from
the area of the circle. The torque on the loop and potential energy are calculated from identifying the magnetic
moment, magnetic field, and angle oriented in the field.

11.6 The Hall Effect

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain a scenario where the magnetic and electric fields are crossed and their forces balance each other
        as a charged particle moves through a velocity selector

    · Compare how charge carriers move in a conductive material and explain how this relates to the Hall effect
482  11 · Magnetic Forces and Fields

     In 1879, E.H. Hall devised an experiment that can be used to identify the sign of the predominant charge carriers in
     a conducting material. From a historical perspective, this experiment was the first to demonstrate that the charge
     carriers in most metals are negative.

          INTERACTIVE

     Visit this website (https://openstax.org/l/21halleffect) to find more information about the Hall effect.

     We investigate the Hall effect by studying the motion of the free electrons along a metallic strip of width l in a
     constant magnetic field (Figure 11.17). The electrons are moving from left to right, so the magnetic force they
     experience pushes them to the bottom edge of the strip. This leaves an excess of positive charge at the top edge of
     the strip, resulting in an electric field E directed from top to bottom. The charge concentration at both edges builds
     up until the electric force on the electrons in one direction is balanced by the magnetic force on them in the opposite
     direction. Equilibrium is reached when:

                                                                                                                                                        11.24

     where e is the magnitude of the electron charge, is the drift speed of the electrons, and E is the magnitude of the
     electric field created by the separated charge. Solving this for the drift speed results in

                                                                                                                                                        11.25

     FIGURE 11.17 In the Hall effect, a potential difference between the top and bottom edges of the metal strip is produced when moving
     charge carriers are deflected by the magnetic field. (a) Hall effect for negative charge carriers; (b) Hall effect for positive charge carriers.

     A scenario where the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to one another is called a crossed-field
     situation. If these fields produce equal and opposite forces on a charged particle with the velocity that equates the
     forces, these particles are able to pass through an apparatus, called a velocity selector, undeflected. This velocity is
     represented in Equation 11.25. Any other velocity of a charged particle sent into the same fields would be deflected
     by the magnetic force or electric force.

     Going back to the Hall effect, if the current in the strip is I, then from Current and Resistance, we know that
                                                                                                                                                        11.26

     where n is the number of charge carriers per volume and A is the cross-sectional area of the strip. Combining the
     equations for and I results in

                                                                                                                                                        11.27

     The field E is related to the potential difference V between the edges of the strip by

                                                                                             11.28

     The quantity V is called the Hall potential and can be measured with a voltmeter. Finally, combining the equations

for I and E gives us

                                                                                                        11.29

where the upper edge of the strip in Figure 11.17 is positive with respect to the lower edge.

We can also combine Equation 11.24 and Equation 11.28 to get an expression for the Hall voltage in terms of the
magnetic field:

                                                                                                                                                   11.30

What if the charge carriers are positive, as in Figure 11.17? For the same current I, the magnitude of V is still given
by Equation 11.29. However, the upper edge is now negative with respect to the lower edge. Therefore, by simply
measuring the sign of V, we can determine the sign of the majority charge carriers in a metal.

Hall potential measurements show that electrons are the dominant charge carriers in most metals. However, Hall
potentials indicate that for a few metals, such as tungsten, beryllium, and many semiconductors, the majority of
charge carriers are positive. It turns out that conduction by positive charge is caused by the migration of missing
electron sites (called holes) on ions. Conduction by holes is studied later in Condensed Matter Physics
(http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/9-introduction).

The Hall effect can be used to measure magnetic fields. If a material with a known density of charge carriers n is
placed in a magnetic field and V is measured, then the field can be determined from Equation 11.29. In research
laboratories where the fields of electromagnets used for precise measurements have to be extremely steady, a "Hall
probe" is commonly used as part of an electronic circuit that regulates the field.

        EXAMPLE 11.8

Velocity Selector

An electron beam enters a crossed-field velocity selector with magnetic and electric fields of 2.0 mT and
                       respectively. (a) What must the velocity of the electron beam be to traverse the crossed fields

undeflected? If the electric field is turned off, (b) what is the acceleration of the electron beam and (c) what is the
radius of the circular motion that results?

Strategy
The electron beam is not deflected by either of the magnetic or electric fields if these forces are balanced. Based on
these balanced forces, we calculate the velocity of the beam. Without the electric field, only the magnetic force is
used in Newton's second law to find the acceleration. Lastly, the radius of the path is based on the resulting circular
motion from the magnetic force.

Solution

  a. The velocity of the unperturbed beam of electrons with crossed fields is calculated by Equation 11.25:

b. The acceleration is calculated from the net force from the magnetic field, equal to mass times acceleration.
     The magnitude of the acceleration is:

c. The radius of the path comes from a balance of the circular and magnetic forces, or Equation 11.25:
484  11 · Magnetic Forces and Fields

     Significance

     If electrons in the beam had velocities above or below the answer in part (a), those electrons would have a stronger
     net force exerted by either the magnetic or electric field. Therefore, only those electrons at this specific velocity
     would make it through.

     The Hall Potential in a Silver Ribbon

     Figure 11.18 shows a silver ribbon whose cross section is 1.0 cm by 0.20 cm. The ribbon carries a current of 100 A
     from left to right, and it lies in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude 1.5 T. Using a density value of
     electrons per cubic meter for silver, find the Hall potential between the edges of the ribbon.

                                         FIGURE 11.18 Finding the Hall potential in a silver ribbon in a magnetic field is shown.

     Strategy
     Since the majority of charge carriers are electrons, the polarity of the Hall voltage is that indicated in the figure. The
     value of the Hall voltage is calculated using Equation 11.29:

     Solution
     When calculating the Hall voltage, we need to know the current through the material, the magnetic field, the length,
     the number of charge carriers, and the area. Since all of these are given, the Hall voltage is calculated as:

made of. We first look at a mass spectrometer to see how we can separate ions by their charge-to-mass ratio. Then
we discuss cyclotrons as a method to accelerate charges to very high energies.

Mass Spectrometer

The mass spectrometer is a device that separates ions according to their charge-to-mass ratios. One particular

version, the Bainbridge mass spectrometer, is illustrated in Figure 11.19. Ions produced at a source are first sent

through a velocity selector, where the magnetic force is equally balanced with the electric force. These ions all

emerge with the same speed          since any ion with a different velocity is deflected preferentially by either the

electric or magnetic force, and ultimately blocked from the next stage. They then enter a uniform magnetic field

where they travel in a circular path whose radius R is given by Equation 11.3. The radius is measured by a particle

detector located as shown in the figure.

FIGURE 11.19 A schematic of the Bainbridge mass spectrometer, showing charged particles leaving a source, followed by a velocity
selector where the electric and magnetic forces are balanced, followed by a region of uniform magnetic field where the particle is ultimately
detected.

The relationship between the charge-to-mass ratio q/m and the radius R is determined by combining Equation 11.3
and Equation 11.25:

                                                                                                                                                   11.31

Since most ions are singly charged        measured values of R can be used with this equation to

determine the mass of ions. With modern instruments, masses can be determined to one part in

An interesting use of a spectrometer is as part of a system for detecting very small leaks in a research apparatus. In
low-temperature physics laboratories, a device known as a dilution refrigerator uses a mixture of He-3, He-4, and
other cryogens to reach temperatures well below 1 K. The performance of the refrigerator is severely hampered if
even a minute leak between its various components occurs. Consequently, before it is cooled down to the desired
temperature, the refrigerator is subjected to a leak test. A small quantity of gaseous helium is injected into one of its
compartments, while an adjacent, but supposedly isolated, compartment is connected to a high-vacuum pump to
which a mass spectrometer is attached. A heated filament ionizes any helium atoms evacuated by the pump. The
detection of these ions by the spectrometer then indicates a leak between the two compartments of the dilution
refrigerator.
486  11 · Magnetic Forces and Fields

     In conjunction with gas chromatography, mass spectrometers are used widely to identify unknown substances.
     While the gas chromatography portion breaks down the substance, the mass spectrometer separates the resulting
     ionized molecules. This technique is used with fire debris to ascertain the cause, in law enforcement to identify
     illegal drugs, in security to identify explosives, and in many medicinal applications.

     Cyclotron

     The cyclotron was developed by E.O. Lawrence to accelerate charged particles (usually protons, deuterons, or
     alpha-particles) to large kinetic energies. These particles are then used for nuclear-collision experiments to produce
     radioactive isotopes. A cyclotron is illustrated in Figure 11.20. The particles move between two flat, semi-cylindrical
     metallic containers D1 and D2, called dees. The dees are enclosed in a larger metal container, and the apparatus is
     placed between the poles of an electromagnet that provides a uniform magnetic field. Air is removed from the large
     container so that the particles neither lose energy nor are deflected because of collisions with air molecules. The
     dees are connected to a high-frequency voltage source that provides an alternating electric field in the small region
     between them. Because the dees are made of metal, their interiors are shielded from the electric field.

     FIGURE 11.20 The inside of a cyclotron. A uniform magnetic field is applied as circulating protons travel through the dees, gaining energy
     as they traverse through the gap between the dees.

     Suppose a positively charged particle is injected into the gap between the dees when D2 is at a positive potential
     relative to D1. The particle is then accelerated across the gap and enters D1 after gaining kinetic energy qV, where V
     is the average potential difference the particle experiences between the dees. When the particle is inside D1, only
     the uniform magnetic field of the electromagnet acts on it, so the particle moves in a circle of radius

                                                                                                                                                        11.32

     with a period of

                                      11.33

     The period of the alternating voltage course is set at T, so while the particle is inside D1, moving along its
     semicircular orbit in a time T/2, the polarity of the dees is reversed. When the particle reenters the gap, D1 is
     positive with respect to D2, and the particle is again accelerated across the gap, thereby gaining a kinetic energy qV.
     The particle then enters D2, circulates in a slightly larger circle, and emerges from D2 after spending a time T/2 in
     this dee. This process repeats until the orbit of the particle reaches the boundary of the dees. At that point, the
     particle (actually, a beam of particles) is extracted from the cyclotron and used for some experimental purpose.

     The operation of the cyclotron depends on the fact that, in a uniform magnetic field, a particle's orbital period is
     independent of its radius and its kinetic energy. Consequently, the period of the alternating voltage source need only
     be set at the one value given by Equation 11.33. With that setting, the electric field accelerates particles every time
     they are between the dees.

If the maximum orbital radius in the cyclotron is R, then from Equation 11.32, the maximum speed of a circulating
particle of mass m and charge q is

                                                                                                                                                   11.34

Thus, its kinetic energy when ejected from the cyclotron is

                                                                                                                11.35

The maximum kinetic energy attainable with this type of cyclotron is approximately 30 MeV. Above this energy,
relativistic effects become important, which causes the orbital period to increase with the radius. Up to energies of
several hundred MeV, the relativistic effects can be compensated for by making the magnetic field gradually
increase with the radius of the orbit. However, for higher energies, much more elaborate methods must be used to
accelerate particles.

Particles are accelerated to very high energies with either linear accelerators or synchrotrons. The linear accelerator

accelerates particles continuously with the electric field of an electromagnetic wave that travels down a long

evacuated tube. The Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) is about 3.3 km long and accelerates electrons and

positrons (positively charged electrons) to energies of 50 GeV. The synchrotron is constructed so that its bending

magnetic field increases with particle speed in such a way that the particles stay in an orbit of fixed radius. The

world's highest-energy synchrotron is located at CERN, which is on the Swiss-French border near Geneva. CERN has

been of recent interest with the verified discovery of the Higgs Boson (see Particle Physics and Cosmology

(http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/11-introduction)). This synchrotron can accelerate

beams of approximately  protons to energies of about GeV.

Strategy

a. The period of revolution is approximately the distance traveled in a circle divided by the speed. Identifying
     that the magnetic force applied is the centripetal force, we can derive the period formula.

INTRODUCTION In the preceding chapter, we saw that a moving charged particle produces a magnetic field. This
connection between electricity and magnetism is exploited in electromagnetic devices, such as a computer hard
drive. In fact, it is the underlying principle behind most of the technology in modern society, including telephones,
television, computers, and the internet.
In this chapter, we examine how magnetic fields are created by arbitrary distributions of electric current, using the
Biot-Savart law. Then we look at how current-carrying wires create magnetic fields and deduce the forces that arise
between two current-carrying wires due to these magnetic fields. We also study the torques produced by the
magnetic fields of current loops. We then generalize these results to an important law of electromagnetism, called
Ampère's law.
We examine some devices that produce magnetic fields from currents in geometries based on loops, known as
solenoids and toroids. Finally, we look at how materials behave in magnetic fields and categorize materials based on
their responses to magnetic fields.

     12.1 The Biot-Savart Law

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how to derive a magnetic field from an arbitrary current in a line segment
         · Calculate magnetic field from the Biot-Savart law in specific geometries, such as a current in a line and a

             current in a circular arc

     We have seen that mass produces a gravitational field and also interacts with that field. Charge produces an electric
     field and also interacts with that field. Since moving charge (that is, current) interacts with a magnetic field, we
     might expect that it also creates that field--and it does.

     The equation used to calculate the magnetic field produced by a current is known as the Biot-Savart law. It is an
     empirical law named in honor of two scientists who investigated the interaction between a straight, current-carrying
     wire and a permanent magnet. This law enables us to calculate the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field
     produced by a current in a wire. The Biot-Savart law states that at any point P (Figure 12.2), the magnetic field
     due to an element of a current-carrying wire is given by

                                                                                                                                                          12.1

BIOT-SAVART LAW

The magnetic field due to a current-carrying wire is found by

                                                                                                12.4

Since this is a vector integral, contributions from different current elements may not point in the same direction.
Consequently, the integral is often difficult to evaluate, even for fairly simple geometries. The following strategy may
be helpful.

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Solving Biot-Savart Problems

To solve Biot-Savart law problems, the following steps are helpful:

1. Identify that the Biot-Savart law is the chosen method to solve the given problem. If there is symmetry in the

problem comparing and           Ampère's law may be the preferred method to solve the question, which will be
discussed in Ampère's Law.

2. Draw the current element length and the unit vector noting that points in the direction of the current
     and points from the current element toward the point where the field is desired.

3. Calculate the cross product  The resultant vector gives the direction of the magnetic field according to

the Biot-Savart law.

4. Use Equation 12.4 and substitute all given quantities into the expression to solve for the magnetic field. Note

all variables that remain constant over the entire length of the wire may be factored out of the integration.

5. Use the right-hand rule to verify the direction of the magnetic field produced from the current or to write down

the direction of the magnetic field if only the magnitude was solved for in the previous part.

        EXAMPLE 12.1

Calculating Magnetic Fields of Short Current Segments

A short wire of length 1.0 cm carries a current of 2.0 A in the vertical direction (Figure 12.3). The rest of the wire is
shielded so it does not add to the magnetic field produced by the wire. Calculate the magnetic field at point P, which
is 1 meter from the wire in the x-direction.

 FIGURE 12.3 A small line segment carries a current I in the vertical direction. What is the magnetic field at a distance x from the segment?

Strategy
We can determine the magnetic field at point P using the Biot-Savart law. Since the current segment is much smaller
504  12 · Sources of Magnetic Fields

     than the distance x, we can drop the integral from the expression. The integration is converted back into a
     summation, but only for small dl, which we now write as Another way to think about it is that each of the radius
     values is nearly the same, no matter where the current element is on the line segment, if is small compared to x.
     The angle is calculated using a tangent function. Using the numbers given, we can calculate the magnetic field at
     P.

     Solution           and is calculated from trigonometry, knowing the distances l and x from the problem:
     The angle between

     The magnetic field at point P is calculated by the Biot-Savart law:

     From the right-hand rule and the Biot-Savart law, the field is directed into the page.
     Significance
     This approximation is only good if the length of the line segment is very small compared to the distance from the
     current element to the point. If not, the integral form of the Biot-Savart law must be used over the entire line
     segment to calculate the magnetic field.

     Using Example 12.1, at what distance would P have to be to measure a magnetic field half of the given answer?

     EXAMPLE 12.2

     Calculating Magnetic Field of a Circular Arc of Wire                                         (Figure 12.4). Calculate

     A wire carries a current I in a circular arc with radius R swept through an arbitrary angle
     the magnetic field at the center of this arc at point P.

                                FIGURE 12.4 A wire segment carrying a current I. The path and radial direction are indicated.

     Strategy
     We can determine the magnetic field at point P using the Biot-Savart law. The radial and path length directions are
     always at a right angle, so the cross product turns into multiplication. We also know that the distance along the path
     dl is related to the radius times the angle (in radians). Then we can pull all constants out of the integration and
     solve for the magnetic field.
     Solution
     The Biot-Savart law starts with the following equation:

12.2 · Magnetic Field Due to a Thin Straight Wire                                                                           505

As we integrate along the arc, all the contributions to the magnetic field are in the same direction (out of the page),

so we can work with the magnitude of the field. The cross product turns into multiplication because the path dl and

the radial direction are perpendicular. We can also substitute the arc length formula,  :

The current and radius can be pulled out of the integral because they are the same regardless of where we are on
the path. This leaves only the integral over the angle,

The angle varies on the wire from 0 to ; hence, the result is

Significance
The direction of the magnetic field at point P is determined by the right-hand rule, as shown in the previous chapter.
If there are other wires in the diagram along with the arc, and you are asked to find the net magnetic field, find each
contribution from a wire or arc and add the results by superposition of vectors. Make sure to pay attention to the
direction of each contribution. Also note that in a symmetric situation, like a straight or circular wire, contributions
from opposite sides of point P cancel each other.

12.2 Magnetic Field Due to a Thin Straight Wire

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain how the Biot-Savart law is used to determine the magnetic field due to a thin, straight wire.
    · Determine the dependence of the magnetic field from a thin, straight wire based on the distance from it

        and the current flowing in the wire.
    · Sketch the magnetic field created from a thin, straight wire by using the second right-hand rule.
How much current is needed to produce a significant magnetic field, perhaps as strong as Earth's field? Surveyors
will tell you that overhead electric power lines create magnetic fields that interfere with their compass readings.
Indeed, when Oersted discovered in 1820 that a current in a wire affected a compass needle, he was not dealing
with extremely large currents. How does the shape of wires carrying current affect the shape of the magnetic field
created? We noted in Magnetic Forces and Fields that a current loop created a magnetic field similar to that of a bar
magnet, but what about a straight wire? We can use the Biot-Savart law to answer all of these questions, including
determining the magnetic field of a long straight wire.
Figure 12.5 shows a section of an infinitely long, straight wire that carries a current I. What is the magnetic field at a
point P, located a distance R from the wire?

     FIGURE 12.5 A section of a thin, straight current-carrying wire. The independent variable has the limits and

     Let's begin by considering the magnetic field due to the current element  located at the position x. Using the

     right-hand rule 1 from the previous chapter,   points out of the page for any element along the wire. At point

     P, therefore, the magnetic fields due to all current elements have the same direction. This means that we can

     calculate the net field there by evaluating the scalar sum of the contributions of the elements. With

     we have from the Biot-Savart law

                                                                                                                    12.5

     The wire is symmetrical about point O, so we can set the limits of the integration from zero to infinity and double the

     answer, rather than integrate from negative infinity to positive infinity. Based on the picture and geometry, we can

     write expressions for r and      in terms of x and R, namely:

     Substituting these expressions into Equation 12.5, the magnetic field integration becomes                      12.6
                                                                                                                    12.7
                                                                         

     Evaluating the integral yields

                                                                                           

     Substituting the limits gives us the solution

                                                                                                                    12.8

     The magnetic field lines of the infinite wire are circular and centered at the wire (Figure 12.6), and they are identical
     in every plane perpendicular to the wire. Since the field decreases with distance from the wire, the spacing of the
     field lines must increase correspondingly with distance. The direction of this magnetic field may be found with a
     second form of the right-hand rule (illustrated in Figure 12.6). If you hold the wire with your right hand so that your

     thumb points along the current, then your fingers wrap around the wire in the same sense as

The direction of the field lines can be observed experimentally by placing several small compass needles on a circle
near the wire, as illustrated in Figure 12.7. When there is no current in the wire, the needles align with Earth's
magnetic field. However, when a large current is sent through the wire, the compass needles all point tangent to the
circle. Iron filings sprinkled on a horizontal surface also delineate the field lines, as shown in Figure 12.7.

        EXAMPLE 12.3
Calculating Magnetic Field Due to Three Wires

Three wires sit at the corners of a square, all carrying currents of 2 amps into the page as shown in Figure 12.8.
Calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field at the other corner of the square, point P, if the length of each side of
the square is 1 cm.

       FIGURE 12.8 Three wires have current flowing into the page. The magnetic field is determined at the fourth corner of the square.

Strategy
The magnetic field due to each wire at the desired point is calculated. The diagonal distance is calculated using the
Pythagorean theorem. Next, the direction of each magnetic field's contribution is determined by drawing a circle
centered at the point of the wire and out toward the desired point. The direction of the magnetic field contribution
508  12 · Sources of Magnetic Fields

     from that wire is tangential to the curve. Lastly, working with these vectors, the resultant is calculated.

     Solution
     Wires 1 and 3 both have the same magnitude of magnetic field contribution at point P:

     Wire 2 has a longer distance and a magnetic field contribution at point P of:

     The vectors for each of these magnetic field contributions are shown.

     The magnetic field in the x-direction has contributions from wire 3 and the x-component of wire 2:
     The y-component is similarly the contributions from wire 1 and the y-component of wire 2:
     Therefore, the net magnetic field is the resultant of these two components:

     Significance
     The geometry in this problem results in the magnetic field contributions in the x- and y-directions having the same
     magnitude. This is not necessarily the case if the currents were different values or if the wires were located in
     different positions. Regardless of the numerical results, working on the components of the vectors will yield the
     resulting magnetic field at the point in need.

12.3 Magnetic Force between Two Parallel Currents

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain how parallel wires carrying currents can attract or repel each other
    · Define the ampere and describe how it is related to current-carrying wires
    · Calculate the force of attraction or repulsion between two current-carrying wires

You might expect that two current-carrying wires generate significant forces between them, since ordinary currents
produce magnetic fields and these fields exert significant forces on ordinary currents. But you might not expect that
the force between wires is used to define the ampere. It might also surprise you to learn that this force has
something to do with why large circuit breakers burn up when they attempt to interrupt large currents.

The force between two long, straight, and parallel conductors separated by a distance r can be found by applying
what we have developed in the preceding sections. Figure 12.9 shows the wires, their currents, the field created by
one wire, and the consequent force the other wire experiences from the created field. Let us consider the field
produced by wire 1 and the force it exerts on wire 2 (call the force ). The field due to at a distance r is

force between the parallel conductors is attractive when the currents are in the same direction. A similar analysis shows that the force is
repulsive between currents in opposite directions.

Since the wires are very long, it is convenient to think in terms of F/l, the force per unit length. Substituting the

expression for into Equation 12.10 and rearranging terms gives

                                                                                                    12.11

The ratio F/l is the force per unit length between two parallel currents and separated by a distance r. The force
is attractive if the currents are in the same direction and repulsive if they are in opposite directions.

This force is responsible for the pinch effect in electric arcs and other plasmas. The force exists whether the
currents are in wires or not. It is only apparent if the overall charge density is zero; otherwise, the Coulomb repulsion
overwhelms the magnetic attraction. In an electric arc, where charges are moving parallel to one another, an
attractive force squeezes currents into a smaller tube. In large circuit breakers, such as those used in neighborhood
power distribution systems, the pinch effect can concentrate an arc between plates of a switch trying to break a
510  12 · Sources of Magnetic Fields

     large current, burn holes, and even ignite the equipment. Another example of the pinch effect is found in the solar
     plasma, where jets of ionized material, such as solar flares, are shaped by magnetic forces.

     The definition of the ampere is based on the force between current-carrying wires. Note that for long, parallel wires
     separated by 1 meter with each carrying 1 ampere, the force per meter is

                                                                                                                                                        12.12

     Since      is exactly            by definition, and because    the force per meter is exactly

                This is the basis of the definition of the ampere.

     Infinite-length wires are impractical, so in practice, a current balance is constructed with coils of wire separated by

     a few centimeters. Force is measured to determine current. This also provides us with a method for measuring the

     coulomb. We measure the charge that flows for a current of one ampere in one second. That is,  For

     both the ampere and the coulomb, the method of measuring force between conductors is the most accurate in

     practice.

     Strategy
     Each wire produces a magnetic field felt by the other wire. The distance along the hypotenuse of the triangle
     between the wires is the radial distance used in the calculation to determine the force per unit length. Since both
     wires have currents flowing in the same direction, the direction of the force is toward each other.
     Solution
     The distance between the wires results from finding the hypotenuse of a triangle:

     The force per unit length can then be calculated using the known currents in the wires:

     The force from the first wire pulls the second wire. The angle between the radius and the x-axis is

                            FIGURE 12.11 Determining the magnetic field at point P along the axis of a current-carrying loop of wire.

     We can use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field due to a current. We first consider arbitrary segments on
     opposite sides of the loop to qualitatively show by the vector results that the net magnetic field direction is along the
     central axis from the loop. From there, we can use the Biot-Savart law to derive the expression for magnetic field.

     Let P be a distance y from the center of the loop. From the right-hand rule, the magnetic field at P, produced by

     and is in the yz-plane, the two vectors are perpendicular, so we have

By setting      in Equation 12.15, we obtain the magnetic field at the center of the loop:

This equation becomes            for a flat coil of N loops per length. It can also be expressed as

                                                                                                                 12.18

If we consider      in Equation 12.16, the expression reduces to an expression known as the magnetic field from

The calculation of the magnetic field due to the circular current loop at points off-axis requires rather complex
mathematics, so we'll just look at the results. The magnetic field lines are shaped as shown in Figure 12.12. Notice
that one field line follows the axis of the loop. This is the field line we just found. Also, very close to the wire, the
field lines are almost circular, like the lines of a long straight wire.

A fundamental property of a static magnetic field is that, unlike an electrostatic field, it is not conservative. A
conservative vector field is one whose line integral between two end points is the same regardless of the path
chosen. Magnetic fields do not have such a property. Instead, there is a relationship between the magnetic field and

its source, electric current. It is expressed in terms of the line integral of and is known as Ampère's law. This law
can also be derived directly from the Biot-Savart law. We now consider that derivation for the special case of an
infinite, straight wire.

Figure 12.14 shows an arbitrary plane perpendicular to an infinite, straight wire whose current I is directed out of
the page. The magnetic field lines are circles directed counterclockwise and centered on the wire. To begin, let's

consider  over the closed paths M and N. Notice that one path (M) encloses the wire, whereas the other (N)

does not. Since the field lines are circular,  is the product of B and the projection of dl onto the circle passing

through If the radius of this particular circle is r, the projection is and

With given by Equation 12.9,

For path M, which circulates around the wire,  and

Path N, on the other hand, circulates through both positive (counterclockwise) and negative (clockwise) (see

Figure 12.14), and since it is closed,         Thus for path N,

                                                                                               12.22

     currents inside the path of integration need be considered.

     To determine whether a specific current I is positive or negative, curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of
     the path of integration, as shown in Figure 12.14. If I passes through S in the same direction as your extended

FIGURE 12.15 The possible components of the magnetic field B due to a current I, which is directed out of the page. The field has no radial
component, so there is no radial contribution to the integral.

Strategy
Consider an arbitrary plane perpendicular to the wire, with the current directed out of the page. The possible
magnetic field components in this plane, and are shown at arbitrary points on a circle of radius r centered on
the wire. Since the field is cylindrically symmetric, neither nor varies with the position on this circle. Also from
symmetry, the radial lines, if they exist, must be directed either all inward or all outward from the wire. This would
mean, however, that there must be a net magnetic flux across an arbitrary cylinder concentric with the wire.
However, because magnetic field lines are continuous, forming closed loops without a beginning or end (see the
discussion in Magnetic Fields and Lines) the net magnetic flux through any closed test surface must be zero. We can
therefore conclude that the radial component of the magnetic field must be zero. Therefore, we can apply Ampère's
law to the circular path as shown.

Solution

Over this path is constant and parallel to so

Thus Ampère's law reduces to
Finally, since is the only component of we can drop the subscript and write

This agrees with the Biot-Savart calculation above.

Significance

Ampère's law works well if you have a path to integrate over which  has results that are easy to simplify. For

the infinite wire, this works easily with a path that is circular around the wire so that the magnetic field factors out of

the integration. If the path dependence looks complicated, you can always go back to the Biot-Savart law and use

that to find the magnetic field.

     uniformly over its cross-section. Find the magnetic field both inside and outside the wire.

     FIGURE 12.16 (a) A model of a current-carrying wire of radius a and current  (b) A cross-section of the same wire showing the radius a
     and the Ampère's loop of radius r.

     Strategy

     This problem has the same geometry as Example 12.6, but the enclosed current changes as we move the
     integration path from outside the wire to inside the wire, where it doesn't capture the entire current enclosed (see
     Figure 12.16).

     Solution
     For any circular path of radius r that is centered on the wire,

     From Ampère's law, this equals the total current passing through any surface bounded by the path of integration.

     Consider first a circular path that is inside the wire  such as that shown in part (a) of Figure 12.16. We need

     the current I passing through the area enclosed by the path. It's equal to the current density J times the area

     enclosed. Since the current is uniform, the current density inside the path equals the current density in the whole

     wire, which is  Therefore the current I passing through the area enclosed by the path is

     We can consider this ratio because the current density J is constant over the area of the wire. Therefore, the current
     density of a part of the wire is equal to the current density in the whole area. Using Ampère's law, we obtain

     and the magnetic field inside the wire is

Significance
The results show that as the radial distance increases inside the thick wire, the magnetic field increases from zero to
a familiar value of the magnetic field of a thin wire. Outside the wire, the field drops off regardless of whether it was
a thick or thin wire.

This result is similar to how Gauss's law for electrical charges behaves inside a uniform charge distribution, except
that Gauss's law for electrical charges has a uniform volume distribution of charge, whereas Ampère's law here has
a uniform area of current distribution. Also, the drop-off outside the thick wire is similar to how an electric field
drops off outside of a linear charge distribution, since the two cases have the same geometry and neither case
depends on the configuration of charges or currents once the loop is outside the distribution.

     Strategy

     Ampère's law states that         where I is the total current passing through the enclosed loop. The

     quickest way to evaluate the integral is to calculate by finding the net current through the loop. Positive
     currents flow with your right-hand thumb if your fingers wrap around in the direction of the loop. This will tell us the
     sign of the answer.

     Solution
     (a) The current going downward through the loop equals the current going out of the loop, so the net current is zero.
     Thus,

     (b) The only current to consider in this problem is 2A because it is the only current inside the loop. The right-hand
     rule shows us the current going downward through the loop is in the positive direction. Therefore, the answer is

     (c) The right-hand rule shows us the current going downward through the loop is in the positive direction. There are
                            of current going downward and -3 A going upward. Therefore, the total current is 9 A and

     Significance
     If the currents all wrapped around so that the same current went into the loop and out of the loop, the net current
     would be zero and no magnetic field would be present. This is why wires are very close to each other in an electrical
     cord. The currents flowing toward a device and away from a device in a wire equal zero total current flow through an
     Ampère loop around these wires. Therefore, no stray magnetic fields can be present from cords carrying current.

We first calculate the magnetic field at the point P of Figure 12.19. This point is on the central axis of the solenoid.
We are basically cutting the solenoid into thin slices that are dy thick and treating each as a current loop. Thus, dI is

the current through each slice. The magnetic field  due to the current dI in dy can be found with the help of
Equation 12.15 and Equation 12.24:

                                                    12.25

where we used Equation 12.24 to replace dI. The resultant field at P is found by integrating along the entire
length of the solenoid. It's easiest to evaluate this integral by changing the independent variable from y to From
inspection of Figure 12.19, we have:

                                                                                                                                                   12.26

     When this is substituted into the equation for we have

                                                                                                                    12.27

     which is the magnetic field along the central axis of a finite solenoid.

     Of special interest is the infinitely long solenoid, for which   From a practical point of view, the infinite

     solenoid is one whose length is much larger than its radius               In this case,  and  Then from

     Equation 12.27, the magnetic field along the central axis of an infinite solenoid is

     or
                                                                                                                                                        12.28

     where n is the number of turns per unit length. You can find the direction of with a right-hand rule: Curl your
     fingers in the direction of the current, and your thumb points along the magnetic field in the interior of the solenoid.

     We now use these properties, along with Ampère's law, to calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field at any

     location inside the infinite solenoid. Consider the closed path of Figure 12.20. Along segment 1, is uniform and

     parallel to the path as shown in Equation 12.28. Along segments 2 and 4, is perpendicular to part of the path and
     vanishes over the rest of it. Therefore, segments 2 and 4 do not contribute to the line integral in Ampère's law. Along

     segment 3,  because the magnetic field is zero outside the solenoid. If you consider an Ampère's law loop

     outside of the solenoid, the current flows in opposite directions on different segments of the loop. Therefore, there

     is no enclosed current and no magnetic field according to Ampère's law. Thus, there is no contribution to the line

     integral from segment 3. As a result, we find

                                                                                                                    12.29

     the location of segment 1 is arbitrary, so we have found that this equation gives the magnetic field everywhere

When a patient undergoes a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, the person lies down on a table that is moved
into the center of a large solenoid that can generate very large magnetic fields. The solenoid is capable of these high
fields from high currents flowing through superconducting wires. The large magnetic field is used to change the spin
of protons in the patient's body. The time it takes for the spins to align or relax (return to original orientation) is a
signature of different tissues that can be analyzed to see if the structures of the tissues is normal (Figure 12.21).

        EXAMPLE 12.9
Magnetic Field Inside a Solenoid

A solenoid has 300 turns wound around a cylinder of diameter 1.20 cm and length 14.0 cm. If the current through
the coils is 0.410 A, what is the magnitude of the magnetic field inside and near the middle of the solenoid?
Strategy
We are given the number of turns and the length of the solenoid so we can find the number of turns per unit length.
Therefore, the magnetic field inside and near the middle of the solenoid is given by Equation 12.30. Outside the
solenoid, the magnetic field is zero.
Solution
The number of turns per unit length is

The magnetic field produced inside the solenoid is

Significance
This solution is valid only if the length of the solenoid is reasonably large compared with its diameter. This example
is a case where this is valid.

     Toroids

     A toroid is a donut-shaped coil closely wound with one continuous wire, as illustrated in part (a) of Figure 12.22. If
     the toroid has N windings and the current in the wire is I, what is the magnetic field both inside and outside the
     toroid?

     FIGURE 12.22 (a) A toroid is a coil wound into a donut-shaped object. (b) A loosely wound toroid does not have cylindrical symmetry. (c) In
     a tightly wound toroid, cylindrical symmetry is a very good approximation. (d) Several paths of integration for Ampère's law.

     We begin by assuming cylindrical symmetry around the axis OO'. Actually, this assumption is not precisely correct,
     for as part (b) of Figure 12.22 shows, the view of the toroidal coil varies from point to point (for example,
     and ) on a circular path centered around OO'. However, if the toroid is tightly wound, all points on the circle
     become essentially equivalent [part (c) of Figure 12.22], and cylindrical symmetry is an accurate approximation.

     With this symmetry, the magnetic field must be tangent to and constant in magnitude along any circular path

     centered on OO'. This allows us to write for each of the paths  and shown in part (d) of Figure 12.22,

                                                                                                                  12.31

     Ampère's law relates this integral to the net current passing through any surface bounded by the path of integration.

     For a path that is external to the toroid, either no current passes through the enclosing surface (path ), or the

     current passing through the surface in one direction is exactly balanced by the current passing through it in the

     opposite direction               In either case, there is no net current passing through the surface, so

     and
                                                                                                                                                        12.32

     The turns of a toroid form a helix, rather than circular loops. As a result, there is a small field external to the coil;
     however, the derivation above holds if the coils were circular.
     For a circular path within the toroid (path ), the current in the wire cuts the surface N times, resulting in a net
     current NI through the surface. We now find with Ampère's law,

The magnetic field is directed in the counterclockwise direction for the windings shown. When the current in the
coils is reversed, the direction of the magnetic field also reverses.

The magnetic field inside a toroid is not uniform, as it varies inversely with the distance r from the axis OO'. However,
if the central radius R (the radius midway between the inner and outer radii of the toroid) is much larger than the
cross-sectional diameter of the coils r, the variation is fairly small, and the magnitude of the magnetic field may be
calculated by Equation 12.33 where

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Classify magnetic materials as paramagnetic, diamagnetic, or ferromagnetic, based on their response to
        a magnetic field

    · Sketch how magnetic dipoles align with the magnetic field in each type of substance
    · Define hysteresis and magnetic susceptibility, which determines the type of magnetic material

Why are certain materials magnetic and others not? And why do certain substances become magnetized by a field,
whereas others are unaffected? To answer such questions, we need an understanding of magnetism on a
microscopic level.

Within an atom, every electron travels in an orbit and spins on an internal axis. Both types of motion produce current
loops and therefore magnetic dipoles. For a particular atom, the net magnetic dipole moment is the vector sum of
the magnetic dipole moments. Values of for several types of atoms are given in Table 12.1. Notice that some
atoms have a zero net dipole moment and that the magnitudes of the nonvanishing moments are typically

TABLE 12.1 Magnetic Moments of Some Atoms

A handful of matter has approximately  atoms and ions, each with its magnetic dipole moment. If no external

magnetic field is present, the magnetic dipoles are randomly oriented--as many are pointed up as down, as many

are pointed east as west, and so on. Consequently, the net magnetic dipole moment of the sample is zero. However,

if the sample is placed in a magnetic field, these dipoles tend to align with the field (see Equation 12.14), and this

alignment determines how the sample responds to the field. On the basis of this response, a material is said to be

either paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, or diamagnetic.

In a paramagnetic material, only a small fraction (roughly one-third) of the magnetic dipoles are aligned with the
526  12 · Sources of Magnetic Fields

     applied field. Since each dipole produces its own magnetic field, this alignment contributes an extra magnetic field,
     which enhances the applied field. When a ferromagnetic material is placed in a magnetic field, its magnetic dipoles
     also become aligned; furthermore, they become locked together so that a permanent magnetization results, even
     when the field is turned off or reversed. This permanent magnetization happens in ferromagnetic materials but not
     paramagnetic materials. Diamagnetic materials are composed of atoms that have no net magnetic dipole moment.
     However, when a diamagnetic material is placed in a magnetic field, a magnetic dipole moment is directed opposite
     to the applied field and therefore produces a magnetic field that opposes the applied field. We now consider each
     type of material in greater detail.

     Paramagnetic Materials

     For simplicity, we assume our sample is a long, cylindrical piece that completely fills the interior of a long, tightly

     wound solenoid. When there is no current in the solenoid, the magnetic dipoles in the sample are randomly oriented

     and produce no net magnetic field. With a solenoid current, the magnetic field due to the solenoid exerts a torque on

     the dipoles that tends to align them with the field. In competition with the aligning torque are thermal collisions that

     tend to randomize the orientations of the dipoles. The relative importance of these two competing processes can be

     estimated by comparing the energies involved. From Equation 12.14, the energy difference between a magnetic

     dipole aligned with and against a magnetic field is  If          (the value of atomic

     hydrogen) and B = 1.0 T, then

     At a room temperature of         the thermal energy per atom is

     which is about 220 times greater than Clearly, energy exchanges in thermal collisions can seriously interfere
     with the alignment of the magnetic dipoles. As a result, only a small fraction of the dipoles is aligned at any instant.

     The four sketches of Figure 12.23 furnish a simple model of this alignment process. In part (a), before the field of
     the solenoid (not shown) containing the paramagnetic sample is applied, the magnetic dipoles are randomly
     oriented and there is no net magnetic dipole moment associated with the material. With the introduction of the field,
     a partial alignment of the dipoles takes place, as depicted in part (b). The component of the net magnetic dipole
     moment that is perpendicular to the field vanishes. We may then represent the sample by part (c), which shows a
     collection of magnetic dipoles completely aligned with the field. By treating these dipoles as current loops, we can
     picture the dipole alignment as equivalent to a current around the surface of the material, as in part (d). This
     fictitious surface current produces its own magnetic field, which enhances the field of the solenoid.

We can express the total magnetic field in the material as

where is a dimensionless quantity called the magnetic susceptibility. Values of for some paramagnetic
materials are given in Table 12.2. Since the alignment of magnetic dipoles is so weak, is very small for
paramagnetic materials. By combining Equation 12.34 and Equation 12.35, we obtain:

                                                                                                                                                   12.36

For a sample within an infinite solenoid, this becomes

     Diamagnetic Materials

     A magnetic field always induces a magnetic dipole in an atom. This induced dipole points opposite to the applied
     field, so its magnetic field is also directed opposite to the applied field. In paramagnetic and ferromagnetic
     materials, the induced magnetic dipole is masked by much stronger permanent magnetic dipoles of the atoms.
     However, in diamagnetic materials, whose atoms have no permanent magnetic dipole moments, the effect of the
     induced dipole is observable.

     We can now describe the magnetic effects of diamagnetic materials with the same model developed for
     paramagnetic materials. In this case, however, the fictitious surface current flows opposite to the solenoid current,
     and the magnetic susceptibility is negative. Values of for some diamagnetic materials are also given in Table
     12.2.

          INTERACTIVE

     Water is a common diamagnetic material. Animals are mostly composed of water. Experiments have been
     performed on frogs (https://openstax.org/l/21frogs) and mice (https://openstax.org/l/21mice) in diverging magnetic
     fields. The water molecules are repelled from the applied magnetic field against gravity until the animal reaches an
     equilibrium. The result is that the animal is levitated by the magnetic field.

     Ferromagnetic Materials

     Common magnets are made of a ferromagnetic material such as iron or one of its alloys. Experiments reveal that a

     ferromagnetic material consists of tiny regions known as magnetic domains. Their volumes typically range from

     to  and they contain about       to  atoms. Within a domain, the magnetic dipoles are rigidly

     aligned in the same direction by coupling among the atoms. This coupling, which is due to quantum mechanical

     effects, is so strong that even thermal agitation at room temperature cannot break it. The result is that each domain

     has a net dipole moment. Some materials have weaker coupling and are ferromagnetic only at lower temperatures.

     If the domains in a ferromagnetic sample are randomly oriented, as shown in Figure 12.24, the sample has no net
     magnetic dipole moment and is said to be unmagnetized. Suppose that we fill the volume of a solenoid with an

     unmagnetized ferromagnetic sample. When the magnetic field of the solenoid is turned on, the dipole moments
     of the domains rotate so that they align somewhat with the field, as depicted in Figure 12.24. In addition, the
     aligned domains tend to increase in size at the expense of unaligned ones. The net effect of these two processes is

the creation of a net magnetic dipole moment for the ferromagnet that is directed along the applied magnetic field.
This net magnetic dipole moment is much larger than that of a paramagnetic sample, and the domains, with their
large numbers of atoms, do not become misaligned by thermal agitation. Consequently, the field due to the
alignment of the domains is quite large.

The domains of a single crystal of nickel. The white lines show the boundaries of the domains. These lines are produced by iron oxide
powder sprinkled on the crystal.

Besides iron, only four elements contain the magnetic domains needed to exhibit ferromagnetic behavior: cobalt,
nickel, gadolinium, and dysprosium. Many alloys of these elements are also ferromagnetic. Ferromagnetic materials
can be described using Equation 12.34 through Equation 12.39, the paramagnetic equations. However, the value of

for ferromagnetic material is usually on the order of to  and it also depends on the history of the magnetic

When is varied over a range of positive and negative values, B is found to behave as shown in Figure 12.26. Note

that the same (corresponding to the same current in the solenoid) can produce different values of B in the

material. The magnetic field B produced in a ferromagnetic material by an applied field depends on the magnetic

history of the material. This effect is called hysteresis, and the curve of Figure 12.26 is called a hysteresis loop.

Notice that B does not disappear when  (i.e., when the current in the solenoid is turned off). The iron stays

     reversed, it takes the path shown from a to b. If is reversed again, the material follows the curve from b to a.

     Like the paramagnetic sample of Figure 12.23, the partial alignment of the domains in a ferromagnet is equivalent to
     a current flowing around the surface. A bar magnet can therefore be pictured as a tightly wound solenoid with a
     large current circulating through its coils (the surface current). You can see in Figure 12.27 that this model fits quite
     well. The fields of the bar magnet and the finite solenoid are strikingly similar. The figure also shows how the poles
     of the bar magnet are identified. To form closed loops, the field lines outside the magnet leave the north (N) pole
     and enter the south (S) pole, whereas inside the magnet, they leave S and enter N.

     Ferromagnetic materials are found in computer hard disk drives and permanent data storage devices (Figure 12.28).
     A material used in your hard disk drives is called a spin valve, which has alternating layers of ferromagnetic (aligning
     with the external magnetic field) and antiferromagnetic (each atom is aligned opposite to the next) metals. It was
     observed that a significant change in resistance was discovered based on whether an applied magnetic field was on
     the spin valve or not. This large change in resistance creates a quick and consistent way for recording or reading
     information by an applied current.

EXAMPLE 12.10

Iron Core in a Coil

A long coil is tightly wound around an iron cylinder whose magnetization curve is shown in Figure 12.25. (a) If

turns per centimeter, what is the applied field when                      (b) What is the net magnetic field for

this same current? (c) What is the magnetic susceptibility in this case?

Strategy
(a) The magnetic field of a solenoid is calculated using Equation 12.28. (b) The graph is read to determine the net
magnetic field for this same current. (c) The magnetic susceptibility is calculated using Equation 12.37.

Solution

a. The applied field of the coil is

  b. From inspection of the magnetization curve of Figure 12.25, we see that, for this value of
        Notice that the internal field of the aligned atoms is much larger than the externally applied field.

   c. The magnetic susceptibility is calculated to be

Significance
Ferromagnetic materials have susceptibilities in the range of which compares well to our results here.
Paramagnetic materials have fractional susceptibilities, so their applied field of the coil is much greater than the
magnetic field generated by the material.

INTRODUCTION We have been considering electric fields created by fixed charge distributions and magnetic fields
produced by constant currents, but electromagnetic phenomena are not restricted to these stationary situations.
Most of the interesting applications of electromagnetism are, in fact, time-dependent. To investigate some of these
applications, we now remove the time-independent assumption that we have been making and allow the fields to
vary with time. In this and the next several chapters, you will see a wonderful symmetry in the behavior exhibited by
time-varying electric and magnetic fields. Mathematically, this symmetry is expressed by an additional term in
Ampère's law and by another key equation of electromagnetism called Faraday's law. We also discuss how moving a
wire through a magnetic field produces an emf or voltage. Lastly, we describe applications of these principles, such
as the card reader shown above.

     13.1 Faraday's Law

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Determine the magnetic flux through a surface, knowing the strength of the magnetic field, the surface
             area, and the angle between the normal to the surface and the magnetic field

         · Use Faraday's law to determine the magnitude of induced emf in a closed loop due to changing magnetic
             flux through the loop

     The first productive experiments concerning the effects of time-varying magnetic fields were performed by Michael
     Faraday in 1831. One of his early experiments is represented in Figure 13.2. An emf is induced when the magnetic
     field in the coil is changed by pushing a bar magnet into or out of the coil. Emfs of opposite signs are produced by
     motion in opposite directions, and the directions of emfs are also reversed by reversing poles. The same results are
     produced if the coil is moved rather than the magnet--it is the relative motion that is important. The faster the
     motion, the greater the emf, and there is no emf when the magnet is stationary relative to the coil.

     FIGURE 13.2 Movement of a magnet relative to a coil produces emfs as shown (a-d). The same emfs are produced if the coil is moved
     relative to the magnet. This short-lived emf is only present during the motion. The greater the speed, the greater the magnitude of the emf,
     and the emf is zero when there is no motion, as shown in (e).

     Faraday also discovered that a similar effect can be produced using two circuits--a changing current in one circuit
     induces a current in a second, nearby circuit. For example, when the switch is closed in circuit 1 of Figure 13.3(a),
     the ammeter needle of circuit 2 momentarily deflects, indicating that a short-lived current surge has been induced
     in that circuit. The ammeter needle quickly returns to its original position, where it remains. However, if the switch of
     circuit 1 is now suddenly opened, another short-lived current surge in the direction opposite from before is observed
     in circuit 2.

FIGURE 13.3 (a) Closing the switch of circuit 1 produces a short-lived current surge in circuit 2. (b) If the switch remains closed, no current
is observed in circuit 2. (c) Opening the switch again produces a short-lived current in circuit 2 but in the opposite direction from before.

Faraday realized that in both experiments, a current flowed in the circuit containing the ammeter only when the
magnetic field in the region occupied by that circuit was changing. As the magnet of the figure was moved, the
strength of its magnetic field at the loop changed; and when the current in circuit 1 was turned on or off, the
strength of its magnetic field at circuit 2 changed. Faraday was eventually able to interpret these and all other
experiments involving magnetic fields that vary with time in terms of the following law:

  FARADAY'S LAW

  The emf induced is the negative change in the magnetic flux per unit time. Any change in the magnetic
  field or change in orientation of the area of the coil with respect to the magnetic field induces a voltage (emf).

The magnetic flux is a measurement of the amount of magnetic field lines through a given surface area, as seen in
Figure 13.4. This definition is similar to the electric flux studied earlier. This means that if we have

The negative sign describes the direction in which the induced emf drives current around a circuit. However, that

     this definition. In many practical applications, the circuit of interest consists of a number N of tightly wound turns

Strategy
The area vector, or direction, is perpendicular to area covering the loop. We will choose this to be pointing
downward so that is parallel to and that the flux turns into multiplication of magnetic field times area. The area
of the loop is not changing in time, so it can be factored out of the time derivative, leaving the magnetic field as the
only quantity varying in time. Lastly, we can apply Ohm's law once we know the induced emf to find the current in
the loop.
Solution

  a. The flux through one turn is

        so we can calculate the magnitude of the emf from Faraday's law. The sign of the emf will be discussed in the

Significance
If the area of the loop were changing in time, we would not be able to pull it out of the time derivative. Since the loop
is a closed path, the result of this current would be a small amount of heating of the wires until the magnetic field
stops changing. This may increase the area of the loop slightly as the wires are heated.

     13.2 Lenz's Law

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Use Lenz's law to determine the direction of induced emf whenever a magnetic flux changes
         · Use Faraday's law with Lenz's law to determine the induced emf in a coil and in a solenoid

     The direction in which the induced emf drives current around a wire loop can be found through the negative sign.
     However, it is usually easier to determine this direction with Lenz's law, named in honor of its discoverer, Heinrich
     Lenz (1804-1865). (Faraday also discovered this law, independently of Lenz.) We state Lenz's law as follows:

       LENZ'S LAW

       The direction of the induced emf drives current around a wire loop to always oppose the change in magnetic flux
       that causes the emf.

     Lenz's law can also be considered in terms of conservation of energy. If pushing a magnet into a coil causes current,
     the energy in that current must have come from somewhere. If the induced current causes a magnetic field
     opposing the increase in field of the magnet we pushed in, then the situation is clear. We pushed a magnet against a
     field and did work on the system, and that showed up as current. If it were not the case that the induced field
     opposes the change in the flux, the magnet would be pulled in and produce a current without any work. Electric
     potential energy would have been created, violating the conservation of energy.

     To determine an induced emf , you first calculate the magnetic flux and then obtain  The magnitude of

     is given by                      Finally, you can apply Lenz's law to determine the sense of . This will be developed

     through examples that illustrate the following problem-solving strategy.

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Lenz's Law

     To use Lenz's law to determine the directions of induced magnetic fields, currents, and emfs:

       1. Make a sketch of the situation for use in visualizing and recording directions.
       2. Determine the direction of the applied magnetic field
       3. Determine whether its magnetic flux is increasing or decreasing.
       4. Now determine the direction of the induced magnetic field The induced magnetic field tries to reinforce a

             magnetic flux that is decreasing or opposes a magnetic flux that is increasing. Therefore, the induced
             magnetic field adds or subtracts to the applied magnetic field, depending on the change in magnetic flux.
       5. Use right-hand rule 2 (RHR-2; see Magnetic Forces and Fields) to determine the direction of the induced
            current I that is responsible for the induced magnetic field
       6. The direction (or polarity) of the induced emf can now drive a conventional current in this direction.

     Let's apply Lenz's law to the system of Figure 13.7(a). We designate the "front" of the closed conducting loop as the
     region containing the approaching bar magnet, and the "back" of the loop as the other region. As the north pole of
     the magnet moves toward the loop, the flux through the loop due to the field of the magnet increases because the
     strength of field lines directed from the front to the back of the loop is increasing. A current is therefore induced in
     the loop. By Lenz's law, the direction of the induced current must be such that its own magnetic field is directed in a
     way to oppose the changing flux caused by the field of the approaching magnet. Hence, the induced current
     circulates so that its magnetic field lines through the loop are directed from the back to the front of the loop. By
     RHR-2, place your thumb pointing against the magnetic field lines, which is toward the bar magnet. Your fingers
     wrap in a counterclockwise direction as viewed from the bar magnet. Alternatively, we can determine the direction
     of the induced current by treating the current loop as an electromagnet that opposes the approach of the north pole
     of the bar magnet. This occurs when the induced current flows as shown, for then the face of the loop nearer the

approaching magnet is also a north pole.

FIGURE 13.7 The change in magnetic flux caused by the approaching magnet induces a current in the loop. (a) An approaching north pole
induces a counterclockwise current with respect to the bar magnet. (b) An approaching south pole induces a clockwise current with respect
to the bar magnet.

Part (b) of the figure shows the south pole of a magnet moving toward a conducting loop. In this case, the flux
through the loop due to the field of the magnet increases because the number of field lines directed from the back
to the front of the loop is increasing. To oppose this change, a current is induced in the loop whose field lines
through the loop are directed from the front to the back. Equivalently, we can say that the current flows in a
direction so that the face of the loop nearer the approaching magnet is a south pole, which then repels the
approaching south pole of the magnet. By RHR-2, your thumb points away from the bar magnet. Your fingers wrap in
a clockwise fashion, which is the direction of the induced current.
Another example illustrating the use of Lenz's law is shown in Figure 13.8. When the switch is opened, the decrease
in current through the solenoid causes a decrease in magnetic flux through its coils, which induces an emf in the
solenoid. This emf must oppose the change (the termination of the current) causing it. Consequently, the induced
emf has the polarity shown and drives in the direction of the original current. This may generate an arc across the
terminals of the switch as it is opened.

     Strategy
     Since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil and constant over each spot in the coil, the dot
     product of the magnetic field and normal to the area unit vector turns into a multiplication. The magnetic field
     can be pulled out of the integration, leaving the flux as the product of the magnetic field times area. We need to take
     the time derivative of the exponential function to calculate the emf using Faraday's law. Then we use Ohm's law to

EXAMPLE 13.3

Changing Magnetic Field Inside a Solenoid

The current through the windings of a solenoid with  turns per meter is changing at a rate

(See Sources of Magnetic Fields for a discussion of solenoids.) The solenoid is 50-cm long and has a cross-sectional

diameter of 3.0 cm. A small coil consisting of       closely wound turns wrapped in a circle of diameter 1.0 cm is

placed in the middle of the solenoid such that the plane of the coil is perpendicular to the central axis of the

solenoid. Assuming that the infinite-solenoid approximation is valid at the location of the small coil, determine the

magnitude of the emf induced in the coil.

Strategy

The magnetic field in the middle of the solenoid is a uniform value of  This field is producing a maximum

magnetic flux through the coil as it is directed along the length of the solenoid. Therefore, the magnetic flux through

the coil is the product of the solenoid's magnetic field times the area of the coil. Faraday's law involves a time

derivative of the magnetic flux. The only quantity varying in time is the current, the rest can be pulled out of the time

derivative. Lastly, we include the number of turns in the coil to determine the induced emf in the coil.

Two examples of this type of flux change are represented in Figure 13.11. In part (a), the flux through the
rectangular loop increases as it moves into the magnetic field, and in part (b), the flux through the rotating coil varies
with the angle .

FIGURE 13.11 (a) Magnetic flux changes as a loop moves into a magnetic field; (b) magnetic flux changes as a loop rotates in a magnetic

Now let's look at a conducting rod pulled in a circuit, changing magnetic flux. The area enclosed by the circuit
`MNOP' of Figure 13.12 is lx and is perpendicular to the magnetic field, so we can simplify the integration of
Equation 13.1 into a multiplication of magnetic field and area. The magnetic flux through the open surface is
therefore

                                                                                                                    13.4

Since B and l are constant and the velocity of the rod is  we can now restate Faraday's law, Equation 13.2,

for the magnitude of the emf in terms of the moving conducting rod as

                                                                                                                    13.5

The current induced in the circuit is the emf divided by the resistance or

Furthermore, the direction of the induced emf satisfies Lenz's law, as you can verify by inspection of the figure.

This calculation of motionally induced emf is not restricted to a rod moving on conducting rails. With                                   as

the starting point, it can be shown that  holds for any change in flux caused by the motion of a

conductor. We saw in Faraday's Law that the emf induced by a time-varying magnetic field obeys this same

relationship, which is Faraday's law. Thus Faraday's law holds for all flux changes, whether they are produced by a

changing magnetic field, by motion, or by a combination of the two.

     In satisfying the principle of energy conservation, the produced and dissipated powers are equal.

     This principle can be seen in the operation of a rail gun. A rail gun is an electromagnetic projectile launcher that uses
     an apparatus similar to Figure 13.12 and is shown in schematic form in Figure 13.13. The conducting rod is replaced
     with a projectile or weapon to be fired. So far, we've only heard about how motion causes an emf. In a rail gun, the
     optimal shutting off/ramping down of a magnetic field decreases the flux in between the rails, causing a current to
     flow in the rod (armature) that holds the projectile. This current through the armature experiences a magnetic force
     and is propelled forward. Rail guns, however, are not used widely in the military due to the high cost of production
     and high currents: Nearly one million amps is required to produce enough energy for a rail gun to be an effective
     weapon.

which is identical to the potential difference between the ends of the rod that we determined earlier.

Motional emfs in Earth's weak magnetic field are not ordinarily very large, or we would notice voltage along metal
rods, such as a screwdriver, during ordinary motions. For example, a simple calculation of the motional emf of a
1.0-m rod moving at 3.0 m/s perpendicular to the Earth's field gives

This small value is consistent with experience. There is a spectacular exception, however. In 1992 and 1996,

attempts were made with the space shuttle to create large motional emfs. The tethered satellite was to be let out on

a 20-km length of wire, as shown in Figure 13.15, to create a 5-kV emf by moving at orbital speed through Earth's

field. This emf could be used to convert some of the shuttle's kinetic and potential energy into electrical energy if a

complete circuit could be made. To complete the circuit, the stationary ionosphere was to supply a return path

through which current could flow. (The ionosphere is the rarefied and partially ionized atmosphere at orbital

altitudes. It conducts because of the ionization. The ionosphere serves the same function as the stationary rails and

connecting resistor in Figure 13.13, without which there would not be a complete circuit.) Drag on the current in the

cable due to the magnetic force                   does the work that reduces the shuttle's kinetic and potential energy,

and allows it to be converted into electrical energy. Both tests were unsuccessful. In the first, the cable hung up and

could only be extended a couple of hundred meters; in the second, the cable broke when almost fully extended.

through Faraday's law, all variables are constant in time but , with             To calculate the work per unit time,

we know this is related to the torque times the angular velocity. The torque is calculated by knowing the force on a

rod and integrating it over the length of the rod.

Solution

a. From geometry, the area of the loop OPSO is      Hence, the magnetic flux through the loop is

Differentiating with respect to time and using      we have

When divided by the resistance R of the loop, this yields for the magnitude of the induced current

As increases, so does the flux through the loop due to To counteract this increase, the magnetic field due

to the induced current must be directed into the page in the region enclosed by the loop. Therefore, as part (b)

of Figure 13.16 illustrates, the current circulates clockwise.

b. You rotate the rod by exerting a torque on it. Since the rod rotates at constant angular velocity, this torque is

equal and opposite to the torque exerted on the current in the rod by the original magnetic field. The magnetic

force on the infinitesimal segment of length dx shown in part (c) of Figure 13.16 is                         so the

magnetic torque on this segment is

The net magnetic torque on the rod is then

The torque that you exert on the rod is equal and opposite to and the work that you do when the rod

rotates through an angle is                         Hence, the work per unit time that you do on the rod is

where we have substituted for I. The power dissipated in the resistor is         , which can be written as

Therefore, we see that

             Hence, the power dissipated in the resistor is equal to the work per unit time done in rotating the rod.
     Significance
     An alternative way of looking at the induced emf from Faraday's law is to integrate in space instead of time. The
     solution, however, would be the same. The motional emf is

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Connect the relationship between an induced emf from Faraday's law to an electric field, thereby showing
             that a changing magnetic flux creates an electric field

         · Solve for the electric field based on a changing magnetic flux in time

     The fact that emfs are induced in circuits implies that work is being done on the conduction electrons in the wires.
     What can possibly be the source of this work? We know that it's neither a battery nor a magnetic field, for a battery
     does not have to be present in a circuit where current is induced, and magnetic fields never do work on moving
     charges. The answer is that the source of the work is an electric field that is induced in the wires. The work done
     by in moving a unit charge completely around a circuit is the induced emf ; that is,

                                                                                                                                                          13.9

     electric field as

     There is an important distinction between the electric field induced by a changing magnetic field and the
     electrostatic field produced by a fixed charge distribution. Specifically, the induced electric field is nonconservative
     because it does net work in moving a charge over a closed path, whereas the electrostatic field is conservative and
     does no net work over a closed path. Hence, electric potential can be associated with the electrostatic field, but not
     with the induced field. The following equations represent the distinction between the two types of electric field:

                                                                                                                                                        13.11

     Our results can be summarized by combining these equations:

                                                                  13.12

     Strategy
     Using cylindrical symmetry, the electric field integral simplifies into the electric field times the circumference of a
     circle. Since we already know the induced emf, we can connect these two expressions by Faraday's law to solve for
     the induced electric field.

     Solution
     The induced electric field in the coil is constant in magnitude over the cylindrical surface, similar to how Ampere's
     law problems with cylinders are solved. Since is tangent to the coil,

When combined with Equation 13.12, this gives

The direction of is counterclockwise, and circulates in the same direction around the coil. The values of E are

Significance

When the magnetic flux through a circuit changes, a nonconservative electric field is induced, which drives current

through the circuit. But what happens if           in free space where there isn't a conducting path? The answer is

that this case can be treated as if a conducting path were present; that is, nonconservative electric fields are

induced wherever          whether or not there is a conducting path present.

These nonconservative electric fields always satisfy Equation 13.12. For example, if the circular coil of Figure 13.9

were removed, an electric field in free space at        would still be directed counterclockwise, and its

magnitude would still be 1.9 V/m at       , 1.5 V/m at  etc. The existence of induced electric fields

is certainly not restricted to wires in circuits.

     Using the formula for the magnetic field inside an infinite solenoid and Faraday's law, we calculate the induced emf.

     13.5 Eddy Currents

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how eddy currents are created in metals
         · Describe situations where eddy currents are beneficial and where they are not helpful

     As discussed two sections earlier, a motional emf is induced when a conductor moves in a magnetic field or when a
     magnetic field moves relative to a conductor. If motional emf can cause a current in the conductor, we refer to that
     current as an eddy current.

     Magnetic Damping

     Eddy currents can produce significant drag, called magnetic damping, on the motion involved. Consider the
     apparatus shown in Figure 13.20, which swings a pendulum bob between the poles of a strong magnet. (This is
     another favorite physics demonstration.) If the bob is metal, significant drag acts on the bob as it enters and leaves
     the field, quickly damping the motion. If, however, the bob is a slotted metal plate, as shown in part (b) of the figure,
     the magnet produces a much smaller effect. There is no discernible effect on a bob made of an insulator. Why does
     drag occur in both directions, and are there any uses for magnetic drag?

     FIGURE 13.20 A common physics demonstration device for exploring eddy currents and magnetic damping. (a) The motion of a metal
     pendulum bob swinging between the poles of a magnet is quickly damped by the action of eddy currents. (b) There is little effect on the
     motion of a slotted metal bob, implying that eddy currents are made less effective. (c) There is also no magnetic damping on a
     nonconducting bob, since the eddy currents are extremely small.

     Figure 13.21 shows what happens to the metal plate as it enters and leaves the magnetic field. In both cases, it
     experiences a force opposing its motion. As it enters from the left, flux increases, setting up an eddy current
     (Faraday's law) in the counterclockwise direction (Lenz's law), as shown. Only the right-hand side of the current loop
     is in the field, so an unopposed force acts on it to the left (RHR-1). When the metal plate is completely inside the
     field, there is no eddy current if the field is uniform, since the flux remains constant in this region. But when the
     plate leaves the field on the right, flux decreases, causing an eddy current in the clockwise direction that, again,
     experiences a force to the left, further slowing the motion. A similar analysis of what happens when the plate swings
     from the right toward the left shows that its motion is also damped when entering and leaving the field.

FIGURE 13.21 A more detailed look at the conducting plate passing between the poles of a magnet. As it enters and leaves the field, the
change in flux produces an eddy current. Magnetic force on the current loop opposes the motion. There is no current and no magnetic drag
when the plate is completely inside the uniform field.

When a slotted metal plate enters the field (Figure 13.22), an emf is induced by the change in flux, but it is less
effective because the slots limit the size of the current loops. Moreover, adjacent loops have currents in opposite
directions, and their effects cancel. When an insulating material is used, the eddy current is extremely small, so
magnetic damping on insulators is negligible. If eddy currents are to be avoided in conductors, then they must be
slotted or constructed of thin layers of conducting material separated by insulating sheets.

FIGURE 13.22 Eddy currents induced in a slotted metal plate entering a magnetic field form small loops, and the forces on them tend to
cancel, thereby making magnetic drag almost zero.

Applications of Magnetic Damping

One use of magnetic damping is found in sensitive laboratory balances. To have maximum sensitivity and accuracy,
the balance must be as friction-free as possible. But if it is friction-free, then it will oscillate for a very long time.
Magnetic damping is a simple and ideal solution. With magnetic damping, drag is proportional to speed and
becomes zero at zero velocity. Thus, the oscillations are quickly damped, after which the damping force disappears,
allowing the balance to be very sensitive (Figure 13.23). In most balances, magnetic damping is accomplished with
a conducting disc that rotates in a fixed field.
568  13 · Electromagnetic Induction

     FIGURE 13.23 Magnetic damping of this sensitive balance slows its oscillations. Since Faraday's law of induction gives the greatest effect
     for the most rapid change, damping is greatest for large oscillations and goes to zero as the motion stops.

     Since eddy currents and magnetic damping occur only in conductors, recycling centers can use magnets to separate
     metals from other materials. Trash is dumped in batches down a ramp, beneath which lies a powerful magnet.
     Conductors in the trash are slowed by magnetic damping while nonmetals in the trash move on, separating from the
     metals (Figure 13.24). This works for all metals, not just ferromagnetic ones. A magnet can separate out the
     ferromagnetic materials alone by acting on stationary trash.

     FIGURE 13.24 Metals can be separated from other trash by magnetic drag. Eddy currents and magnetic drag are created in the metals sent
     down this ramp by the powerful magnet beneath it. Nonmetals move on.

     Other major applications of eddy currents appear in metal detectors and braking systems in trains and roller
     coasters. Portable metal detectors (Figure 13.25) consist of a primary coil carrying an alternating current and a
     secondary coil in which a current is induced. An eddy current is induced in a piece of metal close to the detector,
     causing a change in the induced current within the secondary coil. This can trigger some sort of signal, such as a
     shrill noise.

Braking using eddy currents is safer because factors such as rain do not affect the braking and the braking is
smoother. However, eddy currents cannot bring the motion to a complete stop, since the braking force produced
decreases as speed is reduced. Thus, speed can be reduced from say 20 m/s to 5 m/s, but another form of braking
is needed to completely stop the vehicle. Generally, powerful rare-earth magnets such as neodymium magnets are
used in roller coasters. Figure 13.26 shows rows of magnets in such an application. The vehicle has metal fins
(normally containing copper) that pass through the magnetic field, slowing the vehicle down in much the same way
as with the pendulum bob shown in Figure 13.20.

FIGURE 13.26 The rows of rare-earth magnets (protruding horizontally) are used for magnetic braking in roller coasters. (credit: Stefan
Scheer)

Induction cooktops have electromagnets under their surface. The magnetic field is varied rapidly, producing eddy
currents in the base of the pot, causing the pot and its contents to increase in temperature. Induction cooktops have
high efficiencies and good response times when the base of the pot is a conductor, such as iron or steel.

         · Show that rotating coils have an induced emf; in motors this is called back emf because it opposes the

     A variety of important phenomena and devices can be understood with Faraday's law. In this section, we examine

     Electric Generators

     Electric generators induce an emf by rotating a coil in a magnetic field, as briefly discussed in Motional Emf. We
     now explore generators in more detail. Consider the following example.

Strategy
Faraday's law of induction is used to find the emf induced:

We recognize this situation as the same one in Example 13.6. According to the diagram, the projection of the surface

normal vector to the magnetic field is initially     and this is inserted by the definition of the dot product. The

magnitude of the magnetic field and area of the loop are fixed over time, which makes the integration simplify

quickly. The induced emf is written out using Faraday's law:

Solution                                          ,           , and                    The area of the loop is
We are given that

Entering this value gives

Significance
This is a practical average value, similar to the 120 V used in household power.

The emf calculated in Example 13.9 is the average over one-fourth of a revolution. What is the emf at any given
instant? It varies with the angle between the magnetic field and a perpendicular to the coil. We can get an
expression for emf as a function of time by considering the motional emf on a rotating rectangular coil of width w
and height l in a uniform magnetic field, as illustrated in Figure 13.28.

FIGURE 13.28 A generator with a single rectangular coil rotated at constant angular velocity in a uniform magnetic field produces an emf
that varies sinusoidally in time. Note the generator is similar to a motor, except the shaft is rotated to produce a current rather than the
other way around.

Charges in the wires of the loop experience the magnetic force, because they are moving in a magnetic field.

Charges in the vertical wires experience forces parallel to the wire, causing currents. But those in the top and

bottom segments feel a force perpendicular to the wire, which does not cause a current. We can thus find the

induced emf by considering only the side wires. Motional emf is given to be            , where the velocity v is

perpendicular to the magnetic field B. Here the velocity is at an angle with B, so that its component perpendicular

to B is v sin (see Figure 13.28). Thus, in this case, the emf induced on each side is  , and they are in

the same direction. The total emf around the loop is then

                                                                                                                  13.13

This expression is valid, but it does not give emf as a function of time. To find the time dependence of emf, we

     Now, linear velocity v is related to angular velocity by               Here,  so that                    and

     Noting that the area of the loop is        and allowing for N loops, we find that

     reasonable that ac voltage is sinusoidal.

     generator as a function of time, where is the peak emf. The period is         where f is the frequency.

     The fact that the peak emf is              makes good sense. The greater the number of coils, the larger their area,

     and the stronger the field, the greater the output voltage. It is interesting that the faster the generator is spun

     (greater ), the greater the emf. This is noticeable on bicycle generators--at least the cheaper varieties.

     Figure 13.30 shows a scheme by which a generator can be made to produce pulsed dc. More elaborate
     arrangements of multiple coils and split rings can produce smoother dc, although electronic rather than mechanical
     means are usually used to make ripple-free dc.

In real life, electric generators look a lot different from the figures in this section, but the principles are the same.
The source of mechanical energy that turns the coil can be falling water (hydropower), steam produced by the
burning of fossil fuels, or the kinetic energy of wind. Figure 13.31 shows a cutaway view of a steam turbine; steam
moves over the blades connected to the shaft, which rotates the coil within the generator. The generation of
electrical energy from mechanical energy is the basic principle of all power that is sent through our electrical grids to
our homes.

FIGURE 13.31 Steam turbine/generator. The steam produced by burning coal impacts the turbine blades, turning the shaft, which is
connected to the generator.

Generators illustrated in this section look very much like the motors illustrated previously. This is not coincidental.
In fact, a motor becomes a generator when its shaft rotates. Certain early automobiles used their starter motor as a
generator. In the next section, we further explore the action of a motor as a generator.

Generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, whereas motors convert electrical energy into
mechanical energy. Thus, it is not surprising that motors and generators have the same general construction. A
574  13 · Electromagnetic Induction

     motor works by sending a current through a loop of wire located in a magnetic field. As a result, the magnetic field
     exerts torque on the loop. This rotates a shaft, thereby extracting mechanical work out of the electrical current sent
     in initially. (Refer to Force and Torque on a Current Loop for a discussion on motors that will help you understand
     more about them before proceeding.)

     When the coil of a motor is turned, magnetic flux changes through the coil, and an emf (consistent with Faraday's
     law) is induced. The motor thus acts as a generator whenever its coil rotates. This happens whether the shaft is
     turned by an external input, like a belt drive, or by the action of the motor itself. That is, when a motor is doing work
     and its shaft is turning, an emf is generated. Lenz's law tells us the emf opposes any change, so that the input emf
     that powers the motor is opposed by the motor's self-generated emf, called the back emf of the motor (Figure
     13.32).

     FIGURE 13.32 The coil of a dc motor is represented as a resistor in this schematic. The back emf is represented as a variable emf that
     opposes the emf driving the motor. Back emf is zero when the motor is not turning and increases proportionally to the motor's angular
     velocity.

     The generator output of a motor is the difference between the supply voltage and the back emf. The back emf is zero
     when the motor is first turned on, meaning that the coil receives the full driving voltage and the motor draws
     maximum current when it is on but not turning. As the motor turns faster, the back emf grows, always opposing the
     driving emf, and reduces both the voltage across the coil and the amount of current it draws. This effect is
     noticeable in many common situations. When a vacuum cleaner, refrigerator, or washing machine is first turned on,
     lights in the same circuit dim briefly due to the IR drop produced in feeder lines by the large current drawn by the
     motor.

     When a motor first comes on, it draws more current than when it runs at its normal operating speed. When a

     mechanical load is placed on the motor, like an electric wheelchair going up a hill, the motor slows, the back emf

     drops, more current flows, and more work can be done. If the motor runs at too low a speed, the larger current can

     overheat it (via resistive power in the coil,         perhaps even burning it out. On the other hand, if there is no

     mechanical load on the motor, it increases its angular velocity until the back emf is nearly equal to the driving emf.

     Then the motor uses only enough energy to overcome friction.

     Eddy currents in iron cores of motors can cause troublesome energy losses. These are usually minimized by
     constructing the cores out of thin, electrically insulated sheets of iron. The magnetic properties of the core are
     hardly affected by the lamination of the insulating sheet, while the resistive heating is reduced considerably.
     Consider, for example, the motor coils represented in Figure 13.32. The coils have an equivalent resistance of

                and are driven by an emf of 48.0 V. Shortly after being turned on, they draw a current

     and thus dissipate               of energy as heat transfer. Under normal operating conditions for this

     motor, suppose the back emf is 40.0 V. Then at operating speed, the total voltage across the coils is 8.0 V (48.0 V

     minus the 40.0 V back emf), and the current drawn is

     Under normal load, then, the power dissipated is              This does not cause a

     problem for this motor, whereas the former 5.76 kW would burn out the coils if sustained.

The total resistance  of a series-wound dc motor is                (Figure 13.33). When connected to a 120-V

source ( ), the motor draws 10 A while running at constant angular velocity. (a) What is the back emf induced in

Strategy
The back emf is calculated based on the difference between the supplied voltage and the loss from the current
through the resistance. The power from each device is calculated from one of the power formulas based on the
given information.

Solution

  a. The back emf is

b. Since the potential across the armature is 100 V when the current through it is 10 A, the power output of the
     motor is

c. A 10-A current flows through coils whose combined resistance is  , so the power dissipated in the coils is

d. Since 10 A is drawn from the 120-V source, its power output is

e. Repeating the same calculations with  , we find

        The motor is turning more slowly in this case, so its power output and the power of the source are larger.

     13.7 Applications of Electromagnetic Induction

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how computer hard drives and graphic tablets operate using magnetic induction
         · Explain how hybrid/electric vehicles and transcranial magnetic stimulation use magnetic induction to

             their advantage

     Modern society has numerous applications of Faraday's law of induction, as we will explore in this chapter and
     others. At this juncture, let us mention several that involve recording information using magnetic fields.

     Some computer hard drives apply the principle of magnetic induction. Recorded data are made on a coated,
     spinning disk. Historically, reading these data was made to work on the principle of induction. However, most input
     information today is carried in digital rather than analog form--a series of 0s or 1s are written upon the spinning hard
     drive. Therefore, most hard drive readout devices do not work on the principle of induction, but use a technique
     known as giant magnetoresistance. Giant magnetoresistance is the effect of a large change of electrical resistance
     induced by an applied magnetic field to thin films of alternating ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers. This is one
     of the first large successes of nanotechnology.

     Graphics tablets, or tablet computers where a specially designed pen is used to draw digital images, also applies
     induction principles. The tablets discussed here are labeled as passive tablets, since there are other designs that
     use either a battery-operated pen or optical signals to write with. The passive tablets are different than the touch
     tablets and phones many of us use regularly, but may still be found when signing your signature at a cash register.
     Underneath the screen, shown in Figure 13.34, are tiny wires running across the length and width of the screen. The
     pen has a tiny magnetic field coming from the tip. As the tip brushes across the screen, a changing magnetic field is
     felt in the wires which translates into an induced emf that is converted into the line you just drew.

         FIGURE 13.34 A tablet with a specially designed pen to write with is another application of magnetic induction. (credit: Jane Whitney)

     Another application of induction is the magnetic stripe on the back of your personal credit card as used at the
     grocery store or the ATM. This works on the same principle as the audio or video tape, in which a playback head
     reads personal information from your card.

Check out this video (https://openstax.org/l/21flashmagind) to see how flashlights can use magnetic induction. A
magnet moves by your mechanical work through a wire. The induced current charges a capacitor that stores the
charge that will light the lightbulb even while you are not doing this mechanical work.

Electric and hybrid vehicles also take advantage of electromagnetic induction. One limiting factor that inhibits
widespread acceptance of 100% electric vehicles is that the lifetime of the battery is not as long as the time you get
to drive on a full tank of gas. To increase the amount of charge in the battery during driving, the motor can act as a
generator whenever the car is braking, taking advantage of the back emf produced. This extra emf can be newly
acquired stored energy in the car's battery, prolonging the life of the battery.

Another contemporary area of research in which electromagnetic induction is being successfully implemented is
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A host of disorders, including depression and hallucinations, can be traced
to irregular localized electrical activity in the brain. In transcranial magnetic stimulation, a rapidly varying and very
localized magnetic field is placed close to certain sites identified in the brain. The usage of TMS as a diagnostic
technique is well established.

INTRODUCTION In Electromagnetic Induction, we discussed how a time-varying magnetic flux induces an emf in a
circuit. In many of our calculations, this flux was due to an applied time-dependent magnetic field. The reverse of
this phenomenon also occurs: The current flowing in a circuit produces its own magnetic field.
In Electromagnetic Induction, we also saw that induction is the process by which an emf is induced by changing
electric flux and separation of a dipole. So far, we have discussed some examples of induction, although some of
592  14 · Inductance

     these applications are more effective than others. The smartphone charging mat in the chapter opener photo also
     works by induction. Is there a useful physical quantity related to how "effective" a given device is? The answer is
     yes, and that physical quantity is inductance. In this chapter, we look at the applications of inductance in electronic
     devices and how inductors are used in circuits.

     14.1 Mutual Inductance

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Correlate two nearby circuits that carry time-varying currents with the emf induced in each circuit
         · Describe examples in which mutual inductance may or may not be desirable

     Inductance is the property of a device that tells us how effectively it induces an emf in another device. In other
     words, it is a physical quantity that expresses the effectiveness of a given device.

     When two circuits carrying time-varying currents are close to one another, the magnetic flux through each circuit

     varies because of the changing current I in the other circuit. Consequently, an emf is induced in each circuit by the

     changing current in the other. This type of emf is therefore called a mutually induced emf, and the phenomenon that

     occurs is known as mutual inductance (M). As an example, let's consider two tightly wound coils (Figure 14.2).

     Coils 1 and 2 have and turns and carry currents and respectively. The flux through a single turn of coil

     2 produced by the magnetic field of the current in coil 1 is  whereas the flux through a single turn of coil 1 due

     to the magnetic field of is

                      FIGURE 14.2 Some of the magnetic field lines produced by the current in coil 1 pass through coil 2.

     The mutual inductance            of coil 2 with respect to coil 1 is the ratio of the flux through the  turns of coil 2

     produced by the magnetic field of the current in coil 1, divided by that current, that is,

                                                                                                                           14.1

     Similarly, the mutual inductance of coil 1 with respect to coil 2 is

                                                                                                                           14.2

     Like capacitance, mutual inductance is a geometric quantity. It depends on the shapes and relative positions of the

     two coils, and it is independent of the currents in the coils. The SI unit for mutual inductance M is called the henry

     (H) in honor of Joseph Henry (1799-1878), an American scientist who discovered induced emf independently of

     Faraday. Thus, we have           . From Equation 14.1 and Equation 14.2, we can show that                                so

     we usually drop the subscripts associated with mutual inductance and write

                                                                                                                14.3

The emf developed in either coil is found by combining Faraday's law and the definition of mutual inductance. Since
           is the total flux through coil 2 due to , we obtain
                                                                                                                                                     14.4

where we have used the fact that M is a time-independent constant because the geometry is time-independent.
Similarly, we have

                                                                                                                                                     14.5

In Equation 14.5, we can see the significance of the earlier description of mutual inductance (M) as a geometric

quantity. The value of M neatly encapsulates the physical properties of circuit elements and allows us to separate

the physical layout of the circuit from the dynamic quantities, such as the emf and the current. Equation 14.5

defines the mutual inductance in terms of properties in the circuit, whereas the previous definition of mutual

inductance in Equation 14.1 is defined in terms of the magnetic flux experienced, regardless of circuit elements. You

should be careful when using Equation 14.4 and Equation 14.5 because  do not necessarily represent the

total emfs in the respective coils. Each coil can also have an emf induced in it because of its self-inductance (self-

inductance will be discussed in more detail in a later section).

A large mutual inductance M may or may not be desirable. We want a transformer to have a large mutual inductance.
But an appliance, such as an electric clothes dryer, can induce a dangerous emf on its metal case if the mutual
inductance between its coils and the case is large. One way to reduce mutual inductance is to counter-wind coils to
cancel the magnetic field produced (Figure 14.3).

FIGURE 14.3 The heating coils of an electric clothes dryer can be counter-wound so that their magnetic fields cancel one another, greatly
reducing the mutual inductance with the case of the dryer.

Digital signal processing is another example in which mutual inductance is reduced by counter-winding coils. The
rapid on/off emf representing 1s and 0s in a digital circuit creates a complex time-dependent magnetic field. An emf
can be generated in neighboring conductors. If that conductor is also carrying a digital signal, the induced emf may
be large enough to switch 1s and 0s, with consequences ranging from inconvenient to disastrous.

     surrounding coil?

                                      FIGURE 14.4 A solenoid surrounded by a coil.

     Strategy

     There is no magnetic field outside the solenoid, and the field inside has magnitude     and is

     directed parallel to the solenoid's axis. We can use this magnetic field to find the magnetic flux through the

     surrounding coil and then use this flux to calculate the mutual inductance for part (a), using Equation 14.3. We solve

     part (b) by calculating the mutual inductance from the given quantities and using Equation 14.4 to calculate the

     induced emf.

     Solution

     a. The magnetic flux through the surrounding coil is

     Now from Equation 14.3, the mutual inductance is

     b. Using the previous expression and the given values, the mutual inductance is

     Thus, from Equation 14.4, the emf induced in the surrounding coil is

     Significance

     Notice that M in part (a) is independent of the radius of the surrounding coil because the solenoid's magnetic

     field is confined to its interior. In principle, we can also calculate M by finding the magnetic flux through the solenoid

     produced by the current in the surrounding coil. This approach is much more difficult because is so

     complicated. However, since      we do know the result of this calculation.

14.2 Self-Inductance and Inductors

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Correlate the rate of change of current to the induced emf created by that current in the same circuit
    · Derive the self-inductance for a cylindrical solenoid
    · Derive the self-inductance for a rectangular toroid

Mutual inductance arises when a current in one circuit produces a changing magnetic field that induces an emf in
another circuit. But can the magnetic field affect the current in the original circuit that produced the field? The
answer is yes, and this is the phenomenon called self-inductance.

Inductors

Figure 14.5 shows some of the magnetic field lines due to the current in a circular loop of wire. If the current is
constant, the magnetic flux through the loop is also constant. However, if the current I were to vary with time--say,
immediately after switch S is closed--then the magnetic flux would correspondingly change. Then Faraday's law
tells us that an emf would be induced in the circuit, where

                                                                                                                                                     14.6

Since the magnetic field due to a current-carrying wire is directly proportional to the current, the flux due to this

field is also proportional to the current; that is,

                                                     14.7

FIGURE 14.5 A magnetic field is produced by the current I in the loop. If I were to vary with time, the magnetic flux through the loop would
also vary and an emf would be induced in the loop.

This can also be written as

                                                     14.8

where the constant of proportionality L is known as the self-inductance of the wire loop. If the loop has N turns, this
equation becomes

                                                                                                                                                     14.9

By convention, the positive sense of the normal to the loop is related to the current by the right-hand rule, so in
Figure 14.5, the normal points downward. With this convention, is positive in Equation 14.9, so L always has a
positive value.

For a loop with N turns,     so the induced emf may be written in terms of the self-inductance as
596  14 · Inductance

     When using this equation to determine L, it is easiest to ignore the signs of                              14.10
                                                                                    and calculate L as

     Since self-inductance is associated with the magnetic field produced by a current, any configuration of conductors
     possesses self-inductance. For example, besides the wire loop, a long, straight wire has self-inductance, as does a
     coaxial cable. A coaxial cable is most commonly used by the cable television industry and may also be found
     connecting to your cable modem. Coaxial cables are used due to their ability to transmit electrical signals with
     minimal distortions. Coaxial cables have two long cylindrical conductors that possess current and a self-inductance
     that may have undesirable effects.

     A circuit element used to provide self-inductance is known as an inductor. It is represented by the symbol shown in
     Figure 14.6, which resembles a coil of wire, the basic form of the inductor. Figure 14.7 shows several types of

     In accordance with Lenz's law, the negative sign in Equation 14.10 indicates that the induced emf across an inductor
     always has a polarity that opposes the change in the current. For example, if the current flowing from A to B in
     Figure 14.8(a) were increasing, the induced emf (represented by the imaginary battery) would have the polarity
     shown in order to oppose the increase. If the current from A to B were decreasing, then the induced emf would have
     the opposite polarity, again to oppose the change in current (Figure 14.8(b)). Finally, if the current through the
     inductor were constant, no emf would be induced in the coil.

One common application of inductance is to allow traffic signals to sense when vehicles are waiting at a street
intersection. An electrical circuit with an inductor is placed in the road underneath the location where a waiting car
will stop. The body of the car increases the inductance and the circuit changes, sending a signal to the traffic lights
to change colors. Similarly, metal detectors used for airport security employ the same technique. A coil or inductor
in the metal detector frame acts as both a transmitter and a receiver. The pulsed signal from the transmitter coil
induces a signal in the receiver. The self-inductance of the circuit is affected by any metal object in the path (Figure
14.9). Metal detectors can be adjusted for sensitivity and can also sense the presence of metal on a person.

Large induced voltages are found in camera flashes. Camera flashes use a battery, two inductors that function as a
transformer, and a switching system or oscillator to induce large voltages. Recall from Oscillations
(http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/15-introduction) on oscillations that "oscillation" is
defined as the fluctuation of a quantity, or repeated regular fluctuations of a quantity, between two extreme values
around an average value. Also recall (from Electromagnetic Induction on electromagnetic induction) that we need a
changing magnetic field, brought about by a changing current, to induce a voltage in another coil. The oscillator
system does this many times as the battery voltage is boosted to over 1000 volts. (You may hear the high-pitched
whine from the transformer as the capacitor is being charged.) A capacitor stores the high voltage for later use in
powering the flash.

     Both parts of this problem give all the information needed to solve for the self-inductance in part (a) or the flux
     through each turn of the coil in part (b). The equations needed are Equation 14.10 for part (a) and Equation 14.9 for

     Significance
     The self-inductance and flux calculated in parts (a) and (b) are typical values for coils found in contemporary
     devices. If the current is not changing over time, the flux is not changing in time, so no emf is induced.

     A good approach for calculating the self-inductance of an inductor consists of the following steps:

     PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Self-Inductance

       1. Assume a current I is flowing through the inductor.

     2. Determine the magnetic field produced by the current. If there is appropriate symmetry, you may be able to

     do this with Ampère's law.

     3. Obtain the magnetic flux,

     4. With the flux known, the self-inductance can be found from Equation 14.9,        .

     To demonstrate this procedure, we now calculate the self-inductances of two inductors.

     Cylindrical Solenoid

     Consider a long, cylindrical solenoid with length l, cross-sectional area A, and N turns of wire. We assume that the
     length of the solenoid is so much larger than its diameter that we can take the magnetic field to be
     throughout the interior of the solenoid, that is, we ignore end effects in the solenoid. With a current I flowing
     through the coils, the magnetic field produced within the solenoid is

                                                                                                                                                        14.11

     so the magnetic flux through one turn is

Using Equation 14.9, we find for the self-inductance of the solenoid,

                                                                                                                      14.13

If     is the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid, we may write Equation 14.13 as

                                                                                                                      14.14

where  is the volume of the solenoid. Notice that the self-inductance of a long solenoid depends only on its

physical properties (such as the number of turns of wire per unit length and the volume), and not on the magnetic

field or the current. This is true for inductors in general.

                         is the height of the toroid. Applying Ampère's law in the same manner as we did in Example 13.8

for a toroid with a circular cross-section, we find the magnetic field inside a rectangular toroid is also given by

                                                                                                                                                   14.15

where r is the distance from the central axis of the toroid. Because the field changes within the toroid, we must
calculate the flux by integrating over the toroid's cross-section. Using the infinitesimal cross-sectional area element

              shown in Figure 14.10, we obtain

                                                                                                                                                   14.16

     14.3 Energy in a Magnetic Field

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how energy can be stored in a magnetic field
         · Derive the equation for energy stored in a coaxial cable given the magnetic energy density

     The energy of a capacitor is stored in the electric field between its plates. Similarly, an inductor has the capability to
     store energy, but in its magnetic field. This energy can be found by integrating the magnetic energy density,

                                                                                                                                                        14.18

     over the appropriate volume. To understand where this formula comes from, let's consider the long, cylindrical

     solenoid of the previous section. Again using the infinite solenoid approximation, we can assume that the magnetic

     field is essentially constant and given by    everywhere inside the solenoid. Thus, the energy stored in a

     solenoid or the magnetic energy density times volume is equivalent to

                                                                                      14.19

     With the substitution of Equation 14.14, this becomes

                                                                                      14.20

     Although derived for a special case, this equation gives the energy stored in the magnetic field of any inductor. We

     can see this by considering an arbitrary inductor through which a changing current is passing. At any instant, the

     magnitude of the induced emf is               where is the induced current at that instance. Therefore, the power

     absorbed by the inductor is

                                                                                      14.21

     The total energy stored in the magnetic field when the current increases from 0 to I in a time interval from 0 to t can
     be determined by integrating this expression:

Self-Inductance of a Coaxial Cable

Figure 14.11 shows two long, concentric cylindrical shells of radii and As discussed in Capacitance on
capacitance, this configuration is a simplified representation of a coaxial cable. The capacitance per unit length of
the cable has already been calculated. Now (a) determine the magnetic energy stored per unit length of the coaxial
cable and (b) use this result to find the self-inductance per unit length of the cable.

FIGURE 14.11 (a) A coaxial cable is represented here by two hollow, concentric cylindrical conductors along which electric current flows in
opposite directions. (b) The magnetic field between the conductors can be found by applying Ampère's law to the dashed path. (c) The
cylindrical shell is used to find the magnetic energy stored in a length l of the cable.

Strategy
The magnetic field both inside and outside the coaxial cable is determined by Ampère's law. Based on this magnetic
field, we can use Equation 14.22 to calculate the energy density of the magnetic field. The magnetic energy is
calculated by an integral of the magnetic energy density times the differential volume over the cylindrical shell. After
the integration is carried out, we have a closed-form solution for part (a). The self-inductance per unit length is
determined based on this result and Equation 14.22.

Solution

  a. We determine the magnetic field between the conductors by applying Ampère's law to the dashed circular
        path shown in Figure 14.11(b). Because of the cylindrical symmetry, is constant along the path, and

        This gives us
602  14 · Inductance

     In the region outside the cable, a similar application of Ampère's law shows that  , since no net current

     crosses the area bounded by a circular path where         This argument also holds when  that is, in

     the region within the inner cylinder. All the magnetic energy of the cable is therefore stored between the two

     conductors. Since the energy density of the magnetic field is

     the energy stored in a cylindrical shell of inner radius r, outer radius     and length l (see part (c) of the
     figure) is

     Thus, the total energy of the magnetic field in a length l of the cable is

     and the energy per unit length is                      .

     b. From Equation 14.22,

     where L is the self-inductance of a length l of the coaxial cable. Equating the previous two equations, we find
     that the self-inductance per unit length of the cable is

     Significance

     The inductance per unit length depends only on the inner and outer radii as seen in the result. To increase the

     inductance, we could either increase the outer radius  or decrease the inner radius . In the limit as the two

     radii become equal, the inductance goes to zero. In this limit, there is no coaxial cable. Also, the magnetic energy

     per unit length from part (a) is proportional to the square of the current.

after is opened and is closed.

We first consider the RL circuit of Figure 14.12(b). Once is closed and is open, the source of emf produces a

current in the circuit. If there were no self-inductance in the circuit, the current would rise immediately to a steady

value of However, from Faraday's law, the increasing current produces an emf                            across the

inductor. In accordance with Lenz's law, the induced emf counteracts the increase in the current and is directed as

shown in the figure. As a result, I(t) starts at zero and increases asymptotically to its final value.

Applying Kirchhoff's loop rule to this circuit, we obtain

                                                                                                         14.23

which is a first-order differential equation for I(t). Notice its similarity to the equation for a capacitor and resistor in
series (See RC Circuits). Similarly, the solution to Equation 14.23 can be found by making substitutions in the
equations relating the capacitor to the inductor. This gives

                                                                                                                                                   14.24

is the inductive time constant of the circuit.

The current I(t) is plotted in Figure 14.13(a). It starts at zero, and as  , I(t) approaches asymptotically. The

induced emf  is directly proportional to dI/dt, or the slope of the curve. Hence, while at its greatest

immediately after the switches are thrown, the induced emf decreases to zero with time as the current approaches

its final value of The circuit then becomes equivalent to a resistor connected across a source of emf.

     The energy stored in the magnetic field of an inductor is

                                                                                                                         14.26

     Thus, as the current approaches the maximum current        , the stored energy in the inductor increases from zero
     and asymptotically approaches a maximum of

     The time constant tells us how rapidly the current increases to its final value. At  the current in the circuit
     is, from Equation 14.24,                                                                                    14.27

     which is       of the final value  . The smaller the inductive time constant         the more rapidly the current

     approaches .

     We can find the time dependence of the induced voltage across the inductor in this circuit by using
                                and Equation 14.24:

                                                                                                                         14.28

     The magnitude of this function is plotted in Figure 14.13(b). The greatest value of  it occurs when dI/

     dt is greatest, which is immediately after is closed and is opened. In the approach to steady state, dI/dt

     decreases to zero. As a result, the voltage across the inductor also vanishes as 

     The time constant          also tells us how quickly the induced voltage decays. At  the magnitude of the induced
     voltage is                                                                                                         14.29

     The voltage across the inductor therefore drops to about   of its initial value after one time constant. The shorter

     the time constant the more rapidly the voltage decreases.

     After enough time has elapsed so that the current has essentially reached its final value, the positions of the

     switches in Figure 14.12(a) are reversed, giving us the circuit in part (c). At      the current in the circuit is

                    With Kirchhoff's loop rule, we obtain

                                                                                                                         14.30

     The solution to this equation is similar to the solution of the equation for a discharging capacitor, with similar
     substitutions. The current at time t is then

                                                                                                                                                        14.31

     The current starts at              and decreases with time as the energy stored in the inductor is depleted (Figure

     The time dependence of the voltage across the inductor can be determined from

EXAMPLE 14.4

An RL Circuit with a Source of emf

In the circuit of Figure 14.12(a), let                           With closed and open (Figure

14.12(b)), (a) what is the time constant of the circuit? (b) What are the current in the circuit and the magnitude of

the induced emf across the inductor at  , and as  ?

Strategy
The time constant for an inductor and resistor in a series circuit is calculated using Equation 14.25. The current
through and voltage across the inductor are calculated by the scenarios detailed from Equation 14.24 and Equation
14.32.

Solution

  a. The inductive time constant is

                                 we obtain

                                              

Significance
If the time of the measurement were much larger than the time constant, we would not see the decay or growth of
the voltage across the inductor or resistor. The circuit would quickly reach the asymptotic values for both of these.
See Figure 14.15.

     the time of measurement scale being much larger than the time constant.

     An RL Circuit without a Source of emf

     After the current in the RL circuit of Example 14.4 has reached its final value, the positions of the switches are

     reversed so that the circuit becomes the one shown in Figure 14.12(c). (a) How long does it take the current to drop

     to half its initial value? (b) How long does it take before the energy stored in the inductor is reduced to  of its

     maximum value?

     Strategy

     The current in the inductor will now decrease as the resistor dissipates this energy. Therefore, the current falls as an
     exponential decay. We can also use that same relationship as a substitution for the energy in an inductor formula to
     find how the energy decreases at different time intervals.

     Solution

     a. With the switches reversed, the current decreases according to

          At a time t when the current is one-half its initial value, we have

14.5 Oscillations in an LC Circuit

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain why charge or current oscillates between a capacitor and inductor, respectively, when wired in
        series

    · Describe the relationship between the charge and current oscillating between a capacitor and inductor
        wired in series

It is worth noting that both capacitors and inductors store energy, in their electric and magnetic fields, respectively.
A circuit containing both an inductor (L) and a capacitor (C) can oscillate without a source of emf by shifting the
energy stored in the circuit between the electric and magnetic fields. Thus, the concepts we develop in this section
are directly applicable to the exchange of energy between the electric and magnetic fields in electromagnetic
waves, or light. We start with an idealized circuit of zero resistance that contains an inductor and a capacitor, an LC
circuit.

An LC circuit is shown in Figure 14.16. If the capacitor contains a charge before the switch is closed, then all the
energy of the circuit is initially stored in the electric field of the capacitor (Figure 14.16(a)). This energy is

                                                                                                                                                   14.33

When the switch is closed, the capacitor begins to discharge, producing a current in the circuit. The current, in turn,
creates a magnetic field in the inductor. The net effect of this process is a transfer of energy from the capacitor, with
its diminishing electric field, to the inductor, with its increasing magnetic field.
608  14 · Inductance

     FIGURE 14.16 (a-d) The oscillation of charge storage with changing directions of current in an LC circuit. (e) The graphs show the
     distribution of charge and current between the capacitor and inductor.

     In Figure 14.16(b), the capacitor is completely discharged and all the energy is stored in the magnetic field of the
     inductor. At this instant, the current is at its maximum value and the energy in the inductor is

                                                                                                                                                        14.34

     Since there is no resistance in the circuit, no energy is lost through Joule heating; thus, the maximum energy stored
     in the capacitor is equal to the maximum energy stored at a later time in the inductor:

                                                                                                                                                        14.35

     At an arbitrary time when the capacitor charge is q(t) and the current is i(t), the total energy U in the circuit is given
     by

     Because there is no energy dissipation,

                                              14.36

     After reaching its maximum the current i(t) continues to transport charge between the capacitor plates, thereby
     recharging the capacitor. Since the inductor resists a change in current, current continues to flow, even though the
     capacitor is discharged. This continued current causes the capacitor to charge with opposite polarity. The electric
     field of the capacitor increases while the magnetic field of the inductor diminishes, and the overall effect is a
     transfer of energy from the inductor back to the capacitor. From the law of energy conservation, the maximum
     charge that the capacitor re-acquires is However, as Figure 14.16(c) shows, the capacitor plates are charged

opposite to what they were initially.

When fully charged, the capacitor once again transfers its energy to the inductor until it is again completely
discharged, as shown in Figure 14.16(d). Then, in the last part of this cyclic process, energy flows back to the
capacitor, and the initial state of the circuit is restored.

We have followed the circuit through one complete cycle. Its electromagnetic oscillations are analogous to the

mechanical oscillations of a mass at the end of a spring. In this latter case, energy is transferred back and forth

between the mass, which has kinetic energy           , and the spring, which has potential energy  . With the

absence of friction in the mass-spring system, the oscillations would continue indefinitely. Similarly, the oscillations

of an LC circuit with no resistance would continue forever if undisturbed; however, this ideal zero-resistance LC

circuit is not practical, and any LC circuit will have at least a small resistance, which will radiate and lose energy over

time.

The frequency of the oscillations in a resistance-free LC circuit may be found by analogy with the mass-spring

system. For the circuit,                  , the total electromagnetic energy U is

                                                                                                                  14.37

For the mass-spring system,                 , the total mechanical energy E is

                                                                                                                  14.38

The equivalence of the two systems is clear. To go from the mechanical to the electromagnetic system, we simply

replace m by L, v by i, k by 1/C, and x by q. Now x(t) is given by
                                                                                                                                                   14.39

where          Hence, the charge on the capacitor in an LC circuit is given by

                                                                                                                  14.40

where the angular frequency of the oscillations in the circuit is

                                                                                                                  14.41

Finally, the current in the LC circuit is found by taking the time derivative of q(t):

                                                                                                                  14.42

capacitor to become completely discharged? (d) Find an equation that represents q(t).

Strategy
The angular frequency of the LC circuit is given by Equation 14.41. To find the maximum current, the maximum
energy in the capacitor is set equal to the maximum energy in the inductor. The time for the capacitor to become
610  14 · Inductance

     discharged if it is initially charged is a quarter of the period of the cycle, so if we calculate the period of the
     oscillation, we can find out what a quarter of that is to find this time. Lastly, knowing the initial charge and angular
     frequency, we can set up a cosine equation to find q(t).

     Solution

       a. From Equation 14.41, the angular frequency of the oscillations is

     b. The current is at its maximum  when all the energy is stored in the inductor. From the law of energy
          conservation,

     so

          This result can also be found by an analogy to simple harmonic motion, where current and charge are the
          velocity and position of an oscillator.
     c. The capacitor becomes completely discharged in one-fourth of a cycle, or during a time T/4, where T is the
          period of the oscillations. Since

     the time taken for the capacitor to become fully discharged is

     d. The capacitor is completely charged at         so           Using Equation 14.20, we obtain

     Thus,            and

     Significance

     The energy relationship set up in part (b) is not the only way we can equate energies. At most times, some energy is
     stored in the capacitor and some energy is stored in the inductor. We can put both terms on each side of the
     equation. By examining the circuit only when there is no charge on the capacitor or no current in the inductor, we
     simplify the energy equation.

Damped oscillations of the capacitor charge are shown in this curve of charge versus time, or q versus t. The capacitor contains a charge

This equation is analogous to

which is the equation of motion for a damped mass-spring system (you first encountered this equation in

Oscillations (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/15-introduction)). As we saw in that

chapter, it can be shown that the solution to this differential equation takes three forms, depending on whether the
angular frequency of the undamped spring is greater than, equal to, or less than b/2m. Therefore, the result can be

underdamped  , critically damped                             , or overdamped       . By analogy, the

solution q(t) to the RLC differential equation has the same feature. Here we look only at the case of under-damping.

By replacing m by L, b by R, k by 1/C, and x by q in Equation 14.44, and assuming  , we obtain

                                                                                                         14.45

where the angular frequency of the oscillations is given by

This underdamped solution is shown in Figure 14.17(b). Notice that the amplitude of the oscillations decreases as
energy is dissipated in the resistor. Equation 14.45 can be confirmed experimentally by measuring the voltage
across the capacitor as a function of time. This voltage, multiplied by the capacitance of the capacitor, then gives
q(t).

Alternating-Current Circuits

FIGURE 15.1 The current we draw into our houses is an alternating current (ac). Power lines transmit ac to our neighborhoods, where
local power stations and transformers distribute it to our homes. In this chapter, we discuss how a transformer works and how it allows us
to transmit power at very high voltages and minimal heating losses across the lines.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
15.1 AC Sources
15.2 Simple AC Circuits
15.3 RLC Series Circuits with AC
15.4 Power in an AC Circuit
15.5 Resonance in an AC Circuit
15.6 Transformers

INTRODUCTION Electric power is delivered to our homes by alternating current (ac) through high-voltage
transmission lines. As explained in Transformers, transformers can then change the amplitude of the alternating
potential difference to a more useful form. This lets us transmit power at very high voltages, minimizing resistive
heating losses in the lines, and then furnish that power to homes at lower, safer voltages. Because constant
potential differences are unaffected by transformers, this capability is more difficult to achieve with direct-current
transmission.
In this chapter, we use Kirchhoff's laws to analyze four simple circuits in which ac flows. We have discussed the use
of the resistor, capacitor, and inductor in circuits with batteries. These components are also part of ac circuits.
However, because ac is required, the constant source of emf supplied by a battery is replaced by an ac voltage
source, which produces an oscillating emf.
624  15 · Alternating-Current Circuits

     15.1 AC Sources

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the differences between direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac)
         · Define characteristic features of alternating current and voltage, such as the amplitude or peak and the

             frequency

     Most examples dealt with so far in this book, particularly those using batteries, have constant-voltage sources. Thus,
     once the current is established, it is constant. Direct current (dc) is the flow of electric charge in only one direction.
     It is the steady state of a constant-voltage circuit.

     Most well-known applications, however, use a time-varying voltage source. Alternating current (ac) is the flow of
     electric charge that periodically reverses direction. An ac is produced by an alternating emf, which is generated in a
     power plant, as described in Induced Electric Fields. If the ac source varies periodically, particularly sinusoidally, the
     circuit is known as an ac circuit. Examples include the commercial and residential power that serves so many of our
     needs.

     The ac voltages and frequencies commonly used in businesses and homes vary around the world. In a typical house,
     the potential difference between the two sides of an electrical outlet alternates sinusoidally with a frequency of 60
     or 50 Hz and an amplitude of 170 or 311 V, depending on whether you live in the United States or Europe,
     respectively. Most people know the potential difference for electrical outlets is 120 V or 220 V in the US or Europe,
     but as explained later in the chapter, these voltages are not the peak values given here but rather are related to the
     common voltages we see in our electrical outlets. Figure 15.2 shows graphs of voltage and current versus time for
     typical dc and ac power in the United States.

     FIGURE 15.2 (a) The dc voltage and current are constant in time, once the current is established. (b) The voltage and current versus time
     are quite different for ac power. In this example, which shows 60-Hz ac power and time t in milliseconds, voltage and current are sinusoidal
     and are in phase for a simple resistance circuit. The frequencies and peak voltages of ac sources differ greatly.

     Suppose we hook up a resistor to an ac voltage source and determine how the voltage and current vary in time
     across the resistor. Figure 15.3 shows a schematic of a simple circuit with an ac voltage source. The voltage
     fluctuates sinusoidally with time at a fixed frequency, as shown, on either the battery terminals or the resistor.
     Therefore, the ac voltage, or the "voltage at a plug," can be given by

                                                                                                                                                          15.1

     typical house in the United States,  and  , whereas in Europe,            and

     For this simple resistance circuit,  , so the ac current, meaning the current that fluctuates sinusoidally with
     time at a fixed frequency, is                                                                                                   15.2

     where i is the current at time t and is the peak current and is equal to  . For this example, the voltage and

     current are said to be in phase, meaning that their sinusoidal functional forms have peaks, troughs, and nodes in the

this chapter, we use lowercase letters (such as i) to indicate instantaneous values and capital letters (such as I) to
indicate maximum, or peak, values.

FIGURE 15.3 The potential difference V between the terminals of an ac voltage source fluctuates, so the source and the resistor have ac
sine waves on top of each other. The mathematical expression for v is given by

Current in the resistor alternates back and forth just like the driving voltage, since  . If the resistor is a

fluorescent light bulb, for example, it brightens and dims 120 times per second as the current repeatedly goes

through zero. A 120-Hz flicker is too rapid for your eyes to detect, but if you wave your hand back and forth between

your face and a fluorescent light, you will see the stroboscopic effect of ac.

as shown in Figure 15.4. This sine function assumes we start recording the voltage when it is  at a time of

A phase constant may be involved that shifts the function when we start measuring voltages, similar to the

phase constant in the waves we studied in Waves (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/

16-introduction). However, because we are free to choose when we start examining the voltage, we can ignore this

phase constant for now. We can measure this voltage across the circuit components using one of two methods: (1) a

quantitative approach based on our knowledge of circuits, or (2) a graphical approach that is explained in the

coming sections.

     Resistor

     First, consider a resistor connected across an ac voltage source. From Kirchhoff's loop rule, the instantaneous
     voltage across the resistor of Figure 15.5(a) is

     and the instantaneous current through the resistor is

     Here,     is the amplitude of the time-varying current. Plots of                   and  are shown in Figure 15.5(b).

     Both curves reach their maxima and minima at the same times, that is, the current through and the voltage across

     the resistor are in phase.

     Graphical representations of the phase relationships between current and voltage are often useful in the analysis of

     ac circuits. Such representations are called phasor diagrams. The phasor diagram for    is shown in Figure

     15.6(a), with the current on the vertical axis. The arrow (or phasor) is rotating counterclockwise at a constant

     angular frequency so we are viewing it at one instant in time. If the length of the arrow corresponds to the current

amplitude the projection of the rotating arrow onto the vertical axis is                        which is the
instantaneous current.

and        .

The vertical axis on a phasor diagram could be either the voltage or the current, depending on the phasor that is

being examined. In addition, several quantities can be depicted on the same phasor diagram. For example, both the

current    and the voltage  are shown in the diagram of Figure 15.6(b). Since they have the same frequency

and are in phase, their phasors point in the same direction and rotate together. The relative lengths of the two

phasors are arbitrary because they represent different quantities; however, the ratio of the lengths of the two

phasors can be represented by the resistance, since one is a voltage phasor and the other is a current phasor.

Capacitor

Now let's consider a capacitor connected across an ac voltage source. From Kirchhoff's loop rule, the instantaneous
voltage across the capacitor of Figure 15.7(a) is

Recall that the charge in a capacitor is given by  This is true at any time measured in the ac cycle of

voltage. Consequently, the instantaneous charge on the capacitor is

Since the current in the circuit is the rate at which charge enters (or leaves) the capacitor,

where         is the current amplitude. Using the trigonometric relationship                                  we may

express the instantaneous current as

Dividing by , we obtain an equation that looks similar to Ohm's law:

                                                                                                                  15.3

The quantity is analogous to resistance in a dc circuit in the sense that both quantities are a ratio of a voltage to
a current. As a result, they have the same unit, the ohm. Keep in mind, however, that a capacitor stores and
discharges electric energy, whereas a resistor dissipates it. The quantity is known as the capacitive reactance
of the capacitor, or the opposition of a capacitor to a change in current. It depends inversely on the frequency of the
ac source--high frequency leads to low capacitive reactance.

     A comparison of the expressions for  and      shows that there is a phase difference of                               between

     them. When these two quantities are plotted together, the current peaks a quarter cycle (or                      ) ahead of the

     voltage, as illustrated in Figure 15.7(b). The current through a capacitor leads the voltage across a capacitor by

     or a quarter of a cycle.

     The corresponding phasor diagram is shown in Figure 15.8. Here, the relationship between                         and  is

     represented by having their phasors rotate at the same angular frequency, with the current phasor leading by

     FIGURE 15.8 The phasor diagram for the capacitor of Figure 15.7. The current phasor leads the voltage phasor by  rad as they both
     rotate with the same angular frequency.

     To this point, we have exclusively been using peak values of the current or voltage in our discussion, namely, and
          However, if we average out the values of current or voltage, these values are zero. Therefore, we often use a

     second convention called the root mean square value, or rms value, in discussions of current and voltage. The rms
     operates in reverse of the terminology. First, you square the function, next, you take the mean, and then, you find
     the square root. As a result, the rms values of current and voltage are not zero. Appliances and devices are
     commonly quoted with rms values for their operations, rather than peak values. We indicate rms values with a
     subscript attached to a capital letter (such as ).

     Although a capacitor is basically an open circuit, an rms current, or the root mean square of the current, appears in
     a circuit with an ac voltage applied to a capacitor. Consider that

                                                                                                                               15.4

where is the peak voltage in an ac system. The rms current appears because the voltage is continually reversing,
charging, and discharging the capacitor. If the frequency goes to zero, which would be a dc voltage, tends to
infinity, and the current is zero once the capacitor is charged. At very high frequencies, the capacitor's reactance
tends to zero--it has a negligible reactance and does not impede the current (it acts like a simple wire).

Inductor

Lastly, let's consider an inductor connected to an ac voltage source. From Kirchhoff's loop rule, the voltage across
the inductor L of Figure 15.9(a) is

                                                                                                                                                     15.6

The emf across an inductor is equal to              however, the potential difference across the inductor is

                      , because if we consider that the voltage around the loop must equal zero, the voltage gained

from the ac source must dissipate through the inductor. Therefore, connecting this with the ac voltage source, we

have

FIGURE 15.9 (a) An inductor connected across an ac generator. (b) The current  through the inductor and the voltage  across the

inductor. Here  lags  by rad.

The current     is found by integrating this equation. Since the circuit does not contain a source of constant emf,

there is no steady current in the circuit. Hence, we can set the constant of integration, which represents the steady

current in the circuit, equal to zero, and we have

                                                                                                                     15.7

where                 The relationship between and may also be written in a form analogous to Ohm's law:
                                                                                                                                              15.8

The quantity is known as the inductive reactance of the inductor, or the opposition of an inductor to a change in
current; its unit is also the ohm. Note that varies directly as the frequency of the ac source--high frequency
causes high inductive reactance.

A phase difference of rad occurs between the current through and the voltage across the inductor. From
Equation 15.6 and Equation 15.7, the current through an inductor lags the potential difference across an inductor by

         , or a quarter of a cycle. The phasor diagram for this case is shown in Figure 15.10.

  2. If there is both a capacitor and an inductor, find the net voltage from these two phasors, since they are

     and V is the voltage across it. Since the current and the voltage both depend on time in an ac circuit, the

     Figure 15.16. For a resistor, i(t) and v(t) are in phase and therefore always have the same sign (see Figure 15.5). For

     a capacitor or inductor, the relative signs of i(t) and v(t) vary over a cycle due to their phase differences (see Figure

     15.7 and Figure 15.9). Consequently, p(t) is positive at some times and negative at others, indicating that capacitive

     and inductive elements produce power at some instants and absorb it at others.

     A comparison of p(t) and           is shown in Figure 15.16(d). To make             look like its dc counterpart,

                                        of the current and the voltage. By definition, these are

     where

     With                                      we obtain

     We may then write for the average power dissipated by a resistor,

     This equation further emphasizes why the rms value is chosen in discussion rather than peak values. Both equations
     for average power are correct for Equation 15.13, but the rms values in the formula give a cleaner representation, so
     the extra factor of 1/2 is not necessary.

     household outlet is an rms value. The amplitude of this source is                Because most ac meters are

The phase angle for an ac generator may have any value. If     the generator produces power; if

     In the RLC series circuit of Figure 15.11, the current amplitude is, from Equation 15.10,

    FIGURE 15.17 At an RLC circuit's resonant frequency,             the current amplitude is at its maximum value.

In Oscillations (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/15-introduction), we encountered a
similar graph where the amplitude of a damped harmonic oscillator was plotted against the angular frequency of a
sinusoidal driving force (see Forced Oscillations (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/

Kirchhoff's loop rule to the circuit of Figure 15.11. This yields

                                                                                                                                                   15.16

or

where we substituted dq(t)/dt for i(t). A comparison of Equation 15.16 and, from Oscillations (http://openstax.org/
books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/15-introduction), Damped Oscillations (http://openstax.org/books/
university-physics-volume-1/pages/15-5-damped-oscillations) for damped harmonic motion clearly demonstrates
that the driven RLC series circuit is the electrical analog of the driven damped harmonic oscillator.

The resonant frequency of the RLC circuit is the frequency at which the amplitude of the current is a maximum

and the circuit would oscillate if not driven by a voltage source. By inspection, this corresponds to the angular

frequency  at which the impedance Z in Equation 15.15 is a minimum, or when

and
                                                                                                                                                   15.17

This is the resonant angular frequency of the circuit. Substituting   into Equation 15.9, Equation 15.10, and
Equation 15.11, we find that at resonance,

                                                                     

Therefore, at resonance, an RLC circuit is purely resistive, with the applied emf and current in phase.

What happens to the power at resonance? Equation 15.14 tells us how the average power transferred from an ac

generator to the RLC combination varies with frequency. In addition,  reaches a maximum when Z, which

depends on the frequency, is a minimum, that is, when                  Thus, at resonance, the average

power output of the source in an RLC series circuit is a maximum. From Equation 15.14, this maximum is

Figure 15.18 is a typical plot of  versus in the region of maximum power output. The bandwidth of the

resonance peak is defined as the range of angular frequencies over which the average power               is greater than

        FIGURE 15.18 Like the current, the average power transferred from an ac generator to an RLC circuit peaks at the resonant frequency.

     Resonant circuits are commonly used to pass or reject selected frequency ranges. This is done by adjusting the
     value of one of the elements and hence "tuning" the circuit to a particular resonant frequency. For example, in
     radios, the receiver is tuned to the desired station by adjusting the resonant frequency of its circuitry to match the
     frequency of the station. If the tuning circuit has a high Q, it will have a small bandwidth, so signals from other
     stations at frequencies even slightly different from the resonant frequency encounter a high impedance and are not
     passed by the circuit. Cell phones work in a similar fashion, communicating with signals of around 1 GHz that are
     tuned by an inductor-capacitor circuit. One of the most common applications of capacitors is their use in ac-timing
     circuits, based on attaining a resonant frequency. A metal detector also uses a shift in resonance frequency in
     detecting metals (Figure 15.19).

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain why power plants transmit electricity at high voltages and low currents and how they do this
    · Develop relationships among current, voltage, and the number of windings in step-up and step-down

        transformers

Although ac electric power is produced at relatively low voltages, it is sent through transmission lines at very high

voltages (as high as 500 kV). The same power can be transmitted at different voltages because power is the product

(For simplicity, we ignore the phase factor                 A particular power requirement can therefore be met

with a low voltage and a high current or with a high voltage and a low current. The advantage of the high-voltage/

low-current choice is that it results in lower       ohmic losses in the transmission lines, which can be significant in

lines that are many kilometers long (Figure 15.20).

FIGURE 15.20 The rms voltage from a power plant eventually needs to be stepped down from 12 kV to 240 V so that it can be safely
introduced into a home. A high-voltage transmission line allows a low current to be transmitted via a substation over long distances.

Typically, the alternating emfs produced at power plants are "stepped up" to very high voltages before being
transmitted through power lines; then, they must be "stepped down" to relatively safe values (110 or 220 V rms)
before they are introduced into homes. The device that transforms voltages from one value to another using
induction is the transformer (Figure 15.21).

     modification of work by "Fortyseven"/Flickr)

     As Figure 15.22 illustrates, a transformer basically consists of two separated coils, or windings, wrapped around a

     soft iron core. The primary winding has loops, or turns, and is connected to an alternating voltage        The

     secondary winding has turns and is connected to a load resistor We assume the ideal case for which all

     magnetic field lines are confined to the core so that the same magnetic flux permeates each turn of both the primary

     and the secondary windings. We also neglect energy losses to magnetic hysteresis, to ohmic heating in the

     windings, and to ohmic heating of the induced eddy currents in the core. A good transformer can have losses as low

     as 1% of the transmitted power, so this is not a bad assumption.

     FIGURE 15.22 A step-up transformer (more turns in the secondary winding than in the primary winding). The two windings are wrapped
     around a soft iron core.

     To analyze the transformer circuit, we first consider the primary winding. The input voltage  is equal to the

potential difference induced across the primary winding. From Faraday's law, the induced potential difference is
                    where is the flux through one turn of the primary winding. Thus,

Similarly, the output voltage        delivered to the load resistor must equal the potential difference induced across

the secondary winding. Since the transformer is ideal, the flux through every turn of the secondary winding is also

and

Combining the last two equations, we have

                                                                                                      15.20

Hence, with appropriate values for             the input voltage  may be "stepped up"             or

"stepped down" (               ) to    the output voltage. This is often abbreviated as the transformer equation,

                                                                                                      15.21

which shows that the ratio of the secondary to primary voltages in a transformer equals the ratio of the number of
turns in their windings. For a step-up transformer, which increases voltage and decreases current, this ratio is
greater than one; for a step-down transformer, which decreases voltage and increases current, this ratio is less
than one.

From the law of energy conservation, the power introduced at any instant by    to the primary winding must be
equal to the power dissipated in the resistor of the secondary circuit; thus,

When combined with Equation 15.20, this gives

                                                                                                      15.22

If the voltage is stepped up, the current is stepped down, and vice versa.

Finally, we can use                    , along with Equation 15.20 and Equation 15.22, to obtain

which tells us that the input voltage  "sees" not a resistance but rather a resistance

Our analysis has been based on instantaneous values of voltage and current. However, the resulting equations are
not limited to instantaneous values; they hold also for maximum and rms values.

INTRODUCTION Our view of objects in the sky at night, the warm radiance of sunshine, the sting of sunburn, our
cell phone conversations, and the X-rays revealing a broken bone--all are brought to us by electromagnetic waves. It
would be hard to overstate the practical importance of electromagnetic waves, through their role in vision, through
countless technological applications, and through their ability to transport the energy from the Sun through space to
sustain life and almost all of its activities on Earth.
Theory predicted the general phenomenon of electromagnetic waves before anyone realized that light is a form of
an electromagnetic wave. In the mid-nineteenth century, James Clerk Maxwell formulated a single theory
combining all the electric and magnetic effects known at that time. Maxwell's equations, summarizing this theory,
predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves that travel at the speed of light. His theory also predicted how
these waves behave, and how they carry both energy and momentum. The tails of comets, such as Comet McNaught
in Figure 16.1, provide a spectacular example. Energy carried by light from the Sun warms the comet to release dust
and gas. The momentum carried by the light exerts a weak force that shapes the dust into a tail of the kind seen
here. The flux of particles emitted by the Sun, called the solar wind, typically produces an additional, second tail, as
described in detail in this chapter.
In this chapter, we explain Maxwell's theory and show how it leads to his prediction of electromagnetic waves. We
use his theory to examine what electromagnetic waves are, how they are produced, and how they transport energy
and momentum. We conclude by summarizing some of the many practical applications of electromagnetic waves.

     16.1 Maxwell's Equations and Electromagnetic Waves

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain Maxwell's correction of Ampère's law by including the displacement current
         · State and apply Maxwell's equations in integral form
         · Describe how the symmetry between changing electric and changing magnetic fields explains Maxwell's

             prediction of electromagnetic waves
         · Describe how Hertz confirmed Maxwell's prediction of electromagnetic waves

     James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) was one of the major contributors to physics in the nineteenth century (Figure
     16.2). Although he died young, he made major contributions to the development of the kinetic theory of gases, to
     the understanding of color vision, and to the nature of Saturn's rings. He is probably best known for having combined
     existing knowledge of the laws of electricity and of magnetism with insights of his own into a complete overarching
     electromagnetic theory, represented by Maxwell's equations.

     FIGURE 16.2 James Clerk Maxwell, a nineteenth-century physicist, developed a theory that explained the relationship between electricity
     and magnetism, and correctly predicted that visible light consists of electromagnetic waves.

     Maxwell's Correction to the Laws of Electricity and Magnetism

     The four basic laws of electricity and magnetism had been discovered experimentally through the work of physicists
     such as Oersted, Coulomb, Gauss, and Faraday. Maxwell discovered logical inconsistencies in these earlier results
     and identified the incompleteness of Ampère's law as their cause.

     Recall that according to Ampère's law, the integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop C is proportional to the
     current I passing through any surface whose boundary is loop C itself:

                                                                                                                                                          16.1

     There are infinitely many surfaces that can be attached to any loop, and Ampère's law stated in Equation 16.1 is
     independent of the choice of surface.

     Consider the set-up in Figure 16.3. A source of emf is abruptly connected across a parallel-plate capacitor so that a

     time-dependent current I develops in the wire. Suppose we apply Ampère's law to loop C shown at a time before the

     capacitor is fully charged, so that  . Surface gives a nonzero value for the enclosed current I, whereas

     surface gives zero for the enclosed current because no current passes through it:

Clearly, Ampère's law in its usual form does not work here. This is an internal contradiction in the theory which
requires a modification to the theory, Ampère's law, itself.

              FIGURE 16.3 The currents through surface and surface are unequal, despite having the same boundary loop C.

How can Ampère's law be modified so that it works in all situations? Maxwell suggested including an additional
contribution, called the displacement current , to the real current I,

                                                                                                                                                     16.2

where the displacement current is defined to be

                                                                                                                   16.3

Here is the permittivity of free space and is the electric flux, defined as

The displacement current is analogous to a real current in Ampère's law, entering into Ampère's law in the same
way. It is produced, however, by a changing electric field. It accounts for a changing electric field producing a
magnetic field, just as a real current does, but the displacement current can produce a magnetic field even where no
real current is present. When this extra term is included, the modified Ampère's law equation becomes

                                                                                                                                                     16.4

and is independent of the surface S through which the current I is measured.
We can now examine this modified version of Ampère's law to confirm that it holds independent of whether the
surface or the surface in Figure 16.3 is chosen. The electric field corresponding to the flux in Equation
16.3 is between the capacitor plates. Therefore, the field and the displacement current through the surface
are both zero, and Equation 16.2 takes the form

                                                                                                                                                     16.5

We must now show that for surface through which no actual current flows, the displacement current leads to
660  16 · Electromagnetic Waves

     the same value  for the right side of the Ampère's law equation. For surface  the equation becomes

                                                                                                                    16.6

     Gauss's law for electric charge requires a closed surface and cannot ordinarily be applied to a surface like alone
     or alone. But the two surfaces and form a closed surface in Figure 16.3 and can be used in Gauss's law.
     Because the electric field is zero on , the flux contribution through is zero. This gives us

     Therefore, we can replace the integral over  in Equation 16.6 with the closed Gaussian surface                 and
     apply Gauss's law to obtain                                                                                        16.7

     Thus, the modified Ampère's law equation is the same using surface where the right-hand side results from the
     displacement current, as it is for the surface where the contribution comes from the actual flow of electric
     charge.

     EXAMPLE 16.1

     Displacement current in a charging capacitor

     A parallel-plate capacitor with capacitance C whose plates have area A and separation distance d is connected to a

     resistor R and a battery of voltage V. The current starts to flow at  . (a) Find the displacement current between

     the capacitor plates at time t. (b) From the properties of the capacitor, find the corresponding real current   ,

     and compare the answer to the expected current in the wires of the corresponding RC circuit.

     Strategy
     We can use the equations from the analysis of an RC circuit (Alternating-Current Circuits) plus Maxwell's version of
     Ampère's law.

     Solution

     a. The voltage between the plates at time t is given by

     Let the z-axis point from the positive plate to the negative plate. Then the z-component of the electric field
     between the plates as a function of time t is

     Therefore, the z-component of the displacement current between the plates is

          where we have used             for the capacitance.

The current into the capacitor after the circuit is closed, is therefore

        This current is the same as found in (a).

Maxwell's Equations

With the correction for the displacement current, Maxwell's equations take the form

                                                                                              16.8
                                                                                              16.9
                                                                                             16.10

Once the fields have been calculated using these four equations, the Lorentz force equation

                                                                                             16.12

gives the force that the fields exert on a particle with charge q moving with velocity . The Lorentz force equation
combines the force of the electric field and of the magnetic field on the moving charge. The magnetic and electric
forces have been examined in earlier modules. These four Maxwell's equations are, respectively,

MAXWELL'S EQUATIONS

1. Gauss's law

The electric flux through any closed surface is equal to the electric charge enclosed by the surface. Gauss's
law [Equation 16.8] describes the relation between an electric charge and the electric field it produces. This is
often pictured in terms of electric field lines originating from positive charges and terminating on negative
charges, and indicating the direction of the electric field at each point in space.

2. Gauss's law for magnetism

The magnetic field flux through any closed surface is zero [Equation 16.9]. This is equivalent to the statement
that magnetic field lines are continuous, having no beginning or end. Any magnetic field line entering the region
enclosed by the surface must also leave it. No magnetic monopoles, where magnetic field lines would terminate,
are known to exist (see Magnetic Fields and Lines).

3. Faraday's law

A changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (emf) and, hence, an electric field. The direction of the
emf opposes the change. This third of Maxwell's equations, Equation 16.10, is Faraday's law of induction and
includes Lenz's law. The electric field from a changing magnetic field has field lines that form closed loops,
without any beginning or end.

4. Ampère-Maxwell law

Magnetic fields are generated by moving charges or by changing electric fields. This fourth of Maxwell's
equations, Equation 16.11, encompasses Ampère's law and adds another source of magnetic fields, namely
changing electric fields.

Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force law together encompass all the laws of electricity and magnetism. The
662  16 · Electromagnetic Waves

     symmetry that Maxwell introduced into his mathematical framework may not be immediately apparent. Faraday's
     law describes how changing magnetic fields produce electric fields. The displacement current introduced by
     Maxwell results instead from a changing electric field and accounts for a changing electric field producing a
     magnetic field. The equations for the effects of both changing electric fields and changing magnetic fields differ in
     form only where the absence of magnetic monopoles leads to missing terms. This symmetry between the effects of
     changing magnetic and electric fields is essential in explaining the nature of electromagnetic waves.

     Later application of Einstein's theory of relativity to Maxwell's complete and symmetric theory showed that electric
     and magnetic forces are not separate but are different manifestations of the same thing--the electromagnetic force.
     The electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force are similarly unified as the electroweak force. This unification of
     forces has been one motivation for attempts to unify all of the four basic forces in nature--the gravitational,
     electrical, strong, and weak nuclear forces (see Particle Physics and Cosmology (http://openstax.org/books/
     university-physics-volume-3/pages/11-introduction)).

     The Mechanism of Electromagnetic Wave Propagation

     To see how the symmetry introduced by Maxwell accounts for the existence of combined electric and magnetic

     waves that propagate through space, imagine a time-varying magnetic field         produced by the high-frequency

     alternating current seen in Figure 16.4. We represent  in the diagram by one of its field lines. From Faraday's

     law, the changing magnetic field through a surface induces a time-varying electric field  at the boundary of

     that surface. The displacement current source for the electric field, like the Faraday's law source for the magnetic

     field, produces only closed loops of field lines, because of the mathematical symmetry involved in the equations for

     the induced electric and induced magnetic fields. A field line representation of  is shown. In turn, the changing

     electric field  creates a magnetic field  according to the modified Ampère's law. This changing field

     induces         which induces  and so on. We then have a self-continuing process that leads to the creation

     of time-varying electric and magnetic fields in regions farther and farther away from O. This process may be

     visualized as the propagation of an electromagnetic wave through space.

                                                    FIGURE 16.4 How changing and fields propagate through space.

     In the next section, we show in more precise mathematical terms how Maxwell's equations lead to the prediction of
     electromagnetic waves that can travel through space without a material medium, implying a speed of
     electromagnetic waves equal to the speed of light.

     Prior to Maxwell's work, experiments had already indicated that light was a wave phenomenon, although the nature
     of the waves was yet unknown. In 1801, Thomas Young (1773-1829) showed that when a light beam was
     separated by two narrow slits and then recombined, a pattern made up of bright and dark fringes was formed on a
     screen. Young explained this behavior by assuming that light was composed of waves that added constructively at
     some points and destructively at others (see Interference (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/
     pages/3-introduction)). Subsequently, Jean Foucault (1819-1868), with measurements of the speed of light in
     various media, and Augustin Fresnel (1788-1827), with detailed experiments involving interference and diffraction
     of light, provided further conclusive evidence that light was a wave. So, light was known to be a wave, and Maxwell
     had predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves that traveled at the speed of light. The conclusion seemed
     inescapable: Light must be a form of electromagnetic radiation. But Maxwell's theory showed that other
     wavelengths and frequencies than those of light were possible for electromagnetic waves. He showed that
     electromagnetic radiation with the same fundamental properties as visible light should exist at any frequency. It

remained for others to test, and confirm, this prediction.

When the emf across a capacitor is turned on and the capacitor is allowed to charge, when does the magnetic field
induced by the displacement current have the greatest magnitude?

Hertz's Observations

The German physicist Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894) was the first to generate and detect certain types of
electromagnetic waves in the laboratory. Starting in 1887, he performed a series of experiments that not only
confirmed the existence of electromagnetic waves but also verified that they travel at the speed of light.
Hertz used an alternating-current RLC (resistor-inductor-capacitor) circuit that resonates at a known frequency

                    and connected it to a loop of wire, as shown in Figure 16.5. High voltages induced across the gap in

the loop produced sparks that were visible evidence of the current in the circuit and helped generate
electromagnetic waves.
Across the laboratory, Hertz placed another loop attached to another RLC circuit, which could be tuned (as the dial
on a radio) to the same resonant frequency as the first and could thus be made to receive electromagnetic waves.
This loop also had a gap across which sparks were generated, giving solid evidence that electromagnetic waves had
been received.

FIGURE 16.5 The apparatus used by Hertz in 1887 to generate and detect electromagnetic waves.

Hertz also studied the reflection, refraction, and interference patterns of the electromagnetic waves he generated,

confirming their wave character. He was able to determine the wavelengths from the interference patterns, and

knowing their frequencies, he could calculate the propagation speed using the equation  , where v is the

speed of a wave, f is its frequency, and is its wavelength. Hertz was thus able to prove that electromagnetic waves

travel at the speed of light. The SI unit for frequency, the hertz (  ), is named in his honor.

             and the direction of propagation of plane electromagnetic waves

         · Explain how Maxwell's equations predict that the speed of propagation of electromagnetic waves in free

         · Calculate the relative magnitude of the electric and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic plane wave
         · Describe how electromagnetic waves are produced and detected

     Mechanical waves travel through a medium such as a string, water, or air. Perhaps the most significant prediction of
     Maxwell's equations is the existence of combined electric and magnetic (or electromagnetic) fields that propagate
     through space as electromagnetic waves. Because Maxwell's equations hold in free space, the predicted
     electromagnetic waves, unlike mechanical waves, do not require a medium for their propagation.

     A general treatment of the physics of electromagnetic waves is beyond the scope of this textbook. We can, however,
     investigate the special case of an electromagnetic wave that propagates through free space along the x-axis of a
     given coordinate system.

     Electromagnetic Waves in One Direction

     An electromagnetic wave consists of an electric field, defined as usual in terms of the force per charge on a

     stationary charge, and a magnetic field, defined in terms of the force per charge on a moving charge. The

     electromagnetic field is assumed to be a function of only the x-coordinate and time. The y-component of the electric

     field is then written as         the z-component of the magnetic field as       , etc. Because we are assuming

     free space, there are no free charges or currents, so we can set  and           in Maxwell's equations.

     The transverse nature of electromagnetic waves

     We examine first what Gauss's law for electric fields implies about the relative directions of the electric field and the

     propagation direction in an electromagnetic wave. Assume the Gaussian surface to be the surface of a rectangular

     box whose cross-section is a square of side l and whose third side has length , as shown in Figure 16.6. Because

     the electric field is a function only of x and t, the y-component of the electric field is the same on both the top

     (labeled Side 2) and bottom (labeled Side 1) of the box, so that these two contributions to the flux cancel. The

     corresponding argument also holds for the net flux from the z-component of the electric field through Sides 3 and 4.

     Any net flux through the surface therefore comes entirely from the x-component of the electric field. Because the

     electric field has no y- or z-dependence,  is constant over the face of the box with area A and has a possibly

     different value                  that is constant over the opposite face of the box. Applying Gauss's law gives

                                                                                                                      16.13

     where            is the area of the front and back faces of the rectangular surface. But the charge enclosed is

            , so this component's net flux is also zero, and Equation 16.13 implies                             for any

     . Therefore, if there is an x-component of the electric field, it cannot vary with x. A uniform field of that kind

     would merely be superposed artificially on the traveling wave, for example, by having a pair of parallel-charged

     plates. Such a component         would not be part of an electromagnetic wave propagating along the x-axis; so

            for this wave. Therefore, the only nonzero components of the electric field are  and

     perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave.

FIGURE 16.6 The surface of a rectangular box of dimensions      is our Gaussian surface. The electric field shown is from an
electromagnetic wave propagating along the x-axis.

A similar argument holds by substituting E for B and using Gauss's law for magnetism instead of Gauss's law for
electric fields. This shows that the B field is also perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. The
electromagnetic wave is therefore a transverse wave, with its oscillating electric and magnetic fields perpendicular
to its direction of propagation.

The speed of propagation of electromagnetic waves
We can next apply Maxwell's equations to the description given in connection with Figure 16.4 in the previous
section to obtain an equation for the E field from the changing B field, and for the B field from a changing E field. We
then combine the two equations to show how the changing E and B fields propagate through space at a speed
precisely equal to the speed of light.

First, we apply Faraday's law over Side 3 of the Gaussian surface, using the path shown in Figure 16.7. Because

     Because is small, the magnetic flux through the face can be approximated by its value in the center of the area

     traversed, namely                . The flux of the B field through Face 3 is then the B field times the area,

                                                                                                                                   16.14

     From Faraday's law,

                                                                                                                                   16.15

     Therefore, from Equation 16.13 and Equation 16.14,

     Canceling and taking the limit as           , we are left with

                                                                                                                                   16.16

     We could have applied Faraday's law instead to the top surface (numbered 2) in Figure 16.7, to obtain the resulting
     equation

                                                                                                                                                        16.17

     This is the equation describing the spatially dependent E field produced by the time-dependent B field.

     Next we apply the Ampère-Maxwell law (with  ) over the same two faces (Surface 3 and then Surface 2) of the

     rectangular box of Figure 16.7. Applying Equation 16.10,

to Surface 3, and then to Surface 2, yields the two equations

                                                                                                   16.18

                                                                                                   16.19

These equations describe the spatially dependent B field produced by the time-dependent E field.

We next combine the equations showing the changing B field producing an E field with the equation showing the
changing E field producing a B field. Taking the derivative of Equation 16.16 with respect to x and using Equation
16.19 gives

                                                                                                   16.20

This is the form taken by the general wave equation for our plane wave. Because the equations describe a wave
traveling at some as-yet-unspecified speed c, we can assume the field components are each functions of x - ct for
the wave traveling in the +x-direction, that is,

                                                                                                                                                   16.21

It is left as a mathematical exercise to show, using the chain rule for differentiation, that Equation 16.17 and
Equation 16.18 imply

The speed of the electromagnetic wave in free space is therefore given in terms of the permeability and the
permittivity of free space by

                                                                                                                                                   16.22

We could just as easily have assumed an electromagnetic wave with field components  and            . The

same type of analysis with Equation 16.25 and Equation 16.24 would also show that the speed of an

electromagnetic wave is          .

The physics of traveling electromagnetic fields was worked out by Maxwell in 1873. He showed in a more general

way than our derivation that electromagnetic waves always travel in free space with a speed given by Equation

16.18. If we evaluate the speed     we find that

which is the speed of light. Imagine the excitement that Maxwell must have felt when he discovered this equation!
He had found a fundamental connection between two seemingly unrelated phenomena: electromagnetic fields and
light.

The wave equation was obtained by (1) finding the E field produced by the changing B field, (2) finding the B field
668  16 · Electromagnetic Waves

     produced by the changing E field, and combining the two results. Which of Maxwell's equations was the basis of step
     (1) and which of step (2)?

     How the E and B Fields Are Related

     So far, we have seen that the rates of change of different components of the E and B fields are related, that the
     electromagnetic wave is transverse, and that the wave propagates at speed c. We next show what Maxwell's
     equations imply about the ratio of the E and B field magnitudes and the relative directions of the E and B fields.

     We now consider solutions to Equation 16.16 in the form of plane waves for the electric field:

                                                                                                           16.23

     We have arbitrarily taken the wave to be traveling in the +x-direction and chosen its phase so that the maximum

     field strength occurs at the origin at time    . We are justified in considering only sines and cosines in this way,

     and generalizing the results, because Fourier's theorem implies we can express any wave, including even square

     step functions, as a superposition of sines and cosines.

     At any one specific point in space, the E field oscillates sinusoidally at angular frequency between  and

     and similarly, the B field oscillates between  and        The amplitude of the wave is the maximum value of

            The period of oscillation T is the time required for a complete oscillation. The frequency f is the number of

     complete oscillations per unit of time, and is related to the angular frequency by  . The wavelength is

     the distance covered by one complete cycle of the wave, and the wavenumber k is the number of wavelengths that

     fit into a distance of in the units being used. These quantities are related in the same way as for a mechanical

     wave:

     Given that the solution of has the form shown in Equation 16.20, we need to determine the B field that
     accompanies it. From Equation 16.24, the magnetic field component must obey

                                                                                                                                                        16.24

     Because the solution for the B-field pattern of the wave propagates in the +x-direction at the same speed c as the

     E-field pattern, it must be a function of                 . Thus, we conclude from Equation 16.21 that is

     These results may be written as

                                                                                                           16.25

     Therefore, the peaks of the E and B fields coincide, as do the troughs of the wave, and at each point, the E and B
     fields are in the same ratio equal to the speed of light c. The plane wave has the form shown in Figure 16.8.

Calculating B-Field Strength in an Electromagnetic Wave

What is the maximum strength of the B field in an electromagnetic wave that has a maximum E-field strength of
1000 V/m?
Strategy
To find the B-field strength, we rearrange Equation 16.23 to solve for B, yielding

Solution
We are given E, and c is the speed of light. Entering these into the expression for B yields

Significance
The B-field strength is less than a tenth of Earth's admittedly weak magnetic field. This means that a relatively
strong electric field of 1000 V/m is accompanied by a relatively weak magnetic field.

Changing electric fields create relatively weak magnetic fields. The combined electric and magnetic fields can be
detected in electromagnetic waves, however, by taking advantage of the phenomenon of resonance, as Hertz did. A
system with the same natural frequency as the electromagnetic wave can be made to oscillate. All radio and TV
receivers use this principle to pick up and then amplify weak electromagnetic waves, while rejecting all others not at
their resonant frequency.

Production and Detection of Electromagnetic Waves

A steady electric current produces a magnetic field that is constant in time and which does not propagate as a wave.
670  16 · Electromagnetic Waves

     Accelerating charges, however, produce electromagnetic waves. An electric charge oscillating up and down, or an
     alternating current or flow of charge in a conductor, emit radiation at the frequencies of their oscillations. The
     electromagnetic field of a dipole antenna is shown in Figure 16.9. The positive and negative charges on the two
     conductors are made to reverse at the desired frequency by the output of a transmitter as the power source. The
     continually changing current accelerates charge in the antenna, and this results in an oscillating electric field a
     distance away from the antenna. The changing electric fields produce changing magnetic fields that in turn produce
     changing electric fields, which thereby propagate as electromagnetic waves. The frequency of this radiation is the
     same as the frequency of the ac source that is accelerating the electrons in the antenna. The two conducting
     elements of the dipole antenna are commonly straight wires. The total length of the two wires is typically about one-
     half of the desired wavelength (hence, the alternative name half-wave antenna), because this allows standing waves
     to be set up and enhances the effectiveness of the radiation.

                          FIGURE 16.9 The oscillatory motion of the charges in a dipole antenna produces electromagnetic radiation.

     The electric field lines in one plane are shown. The magnetic field is perpendicular to this plane. This radiation field
     has cylindrical symmetry around the axis of the dipole. Field lines near the dipole are not shown. The pattern is not
     at all uniform in all directions. The strongest signal is in directions perpendicular to the axis of the antenna, which
     would be horizontal if the antenna is mounted vertically. There is zero intensity along the axis of the antenna. The
     fields detected far from the antenna are from the changing electric and magnetic fields inducing each other and
     traveling as electromagnetic waves. Far from the antenna, the wave fronts, or surfaces of equal phase for the
     electromagnetic wave, are almost spherical. Even farther from the antenna, the radiation propagates like
     electromagnetic plane waves.
     The electromagnetic waves carry energy away from their source, similar to a sound wave carrying energy away from
     a standing wave on a guitar string. An antenna for receiving electromagnetic signals works in reverse. Incoming
     electromagnetic waves induce oscillating currents in the antenna, each at its own frequency. The radio receiver
     includes a tuner circuit, whose resonant frequency can be adjusted. The tuner responds strongly to the desired
     frequency but not others, allowing the user to tune to the desired broadcast. Electrical components amplify the
     signal formed by the moving electrons. The signal is then converted into an audio and/or video format.

16.3 Energy Carried by Electromagnetic Waves

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Express the time-averaged energy density of electromagnetic waves in terms of their electric and
        magnetic field amplitudes

    · Calculate the Poynting vector and the energy intensity of electromagnetic waves
    · Explain how the energy of an electromagnetic wave depends on its amplitude, whereas the energy of a

        photon is proportional to its frequency

Anyone who has used a microwave oven knows there is energy in electromagnetic waves. Sometimes this energy is
obvious, such as in the warmth of the summer Sun. Other times, it is subtle, such as the unfelt energy of gamma
rays, which can destroy living cells.

Electromagnetic waves bring energy into a system by virtue of their electric and magnetic fields. These fields can
exert forces and move charges in the system and, thus, do work on them. However, there is energy in an
electromagnetic wave itself, whether it is absorbed or not. Once created, the fields carry energy away from a source.
If some energy is later absorbed, the field strengths are diminished and anything left travels on.

Clearly, the larger the strength of the electric and magnetic fields, the more work they can do and the greater the
energy the electromagnetic wave carries. In electromagnetic waves, the amplitude is the maximum field strength of
the electric and magnetic fields (Figure 16.10). The wave energy is determined by the wave amplitude.

FIGURE 16.10 Energy carried by a wave depends on its amplitude. With electromagnetic waves, doubling the E fields and B fields
quadruples the energy density u and the energy flux uc.

For a plane wave traveling in the direction of the positive x-axis with the phase of the wave chosen so that the wave

maximum is at the origin at  , the electric and magnetic fields obey the equations

The energy in any part of the electromagnetic wave is the sum of the energies of the electric and magnetic fields.
This energy per unit volume, or energy density u, is the sum of the energy density from the electric field and the
energy density from the magnetic field. Expressions for both field energy densities were discussed earlier ( in
Capacitance and in Inductance). Combining these the contributions, we obtain

The expression               then shows that the magnetic energy density and electric energy density

are equal, despite the fact that changing electric fields generally produce only small magnetic fields. The equality of
672  16 · Electromagnetic Waves

     the electric and magnetic energy densities leads to

                                                                                                                               16.27

     The energy density moves with the electric and magnetic fields in a similar manner to the waves themselves.

     We can find the rate of transport of energy by considering a small time interval . As shown in Figure 16.11, the
     energy contained in a cylinder of length and cross-sectional area A passes through the cross-sectional plane in
     the interval

     FIGURE 16.11 The energy          contained in the electric and magnetic fields of the electromagnetic wave in the volume  passes
     through the area A in time .

     The energy passing through area A in time is

     The energy per unit area per unit time passing through a plane perpendicular to the wave, called the energy flux and
     denoted by S, can be calculated by dividing the energy by the area A and the time interval .

     More generally, the flux of energy through any surface also depends on the orientation of the surface. To take the
     direction into account, we introduce a vector , called the Poynting vector, with the following definition:

                                                                                                                                                        16.28

     The cross-product of and points in the direction perpendicular to both vectors. To confirm that the direction of

     is that of wave propagation, and not its negative, return to Figure 16.7. Note that Lenz's and Faraday's laws imply

     that when the magnetic field shown is increasing in time, the electric field is greater at x than at                      . The electric

     field is decreasing with increasing x at the given time and location. The proportionality between electric and

     magnetic fields requires the electric field to increase in time along with the magnetic field. This is possible only if the

     wave is propagating to the right in the diagram, in which case, the relative orientations show that                               is

     specifically in the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave.

     The energy flux at any place also varies in time, as can be seen by substituting u from Equation 16.23 into Equation
     16.27.

                                                                                                                                                        16.29

     Because the frequency of visible light is very high, of the order of       the energy flux for visible light through

     any area is an extremely rapidly varying quantity. Most measuring devices, including our eyes, detect only an

     average over many cycles. The time average of the energy flux is the intensity I of the electromagnetic wave and is

     the power per unit area. It can be expressed by averaging the cosine function in Equation 16.29 over one complete

     cycle, which is the same as time-averaging over many cycles (here, T is one period):

We can either evaluate the integral, or else note that because the sine and cosine differ merely in phase, the average

over a complete cycle for   is the same as for           , to obtain

where the angle brackets    stand for the time-averaging operation. The intensity of light moving at speed c in
vacuum is then found to be                                                                                                           16.31

where is the magnetic field amplitude, which is the same as the maximum magnetic field strength. One more
expression for in terms of both electric and magnetic field strengths is useful. Substituting the fact that

               the previous expression becomes

                                                                                                                                                   16.33

We can use whichever of the three preceding equations is most convenient, because the three equations are really
just different versions of the same result: The energy in a wave is related to amplitude squared. Furthermore,
because these equations are based on the assumption that the electromagnetic waves are sinusoidal, the peak
intensity is twice the average intensity; that is,

the figure. Change the power output P by a factor of (90 kW/60 kW) and change the area by the same factor to keep

                       the same. Then use the proportion of area A in the diagram to distance squared to find the
distance that produces the calculated change in area.
Solution
Using the proportionality of the areas to the squares of the distances, and solving, we obtain from the diagram

Significance
The range of a radio signal is the maximum distance between the transmitter and receiver that allows for normal
operation. In the absence of complications such as reflections from obstacles, the intensity follows an inverse
square law, and doubling the range would require multiplying the power by four.

16.4 Momentum and Radiation Pressure

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe the relationship of the radiation pressure and the energy density of an electromagnetic wave
    · Explain how the radiation pressure of light, while small, can produce observable astronomical effects
Material objects consist of charged particles. An electromagnetic wave incident on the object exerts forces on the
charged particles, in accordance with the Lorentz force, Equation 16.11. These forces do work on the particles of the
object, increasing its energy, as discussed in the previous section. The energy that sunlight carries is a familiar part
of every warm sunny day. A much less familiar feature of electromagnetic radiation is the extremely weak pressure
that electromagnetic radiation produces by exerting a force in the direction of the wave. This force occurs because
electromagnetic waves contain and transport momentum.
To understand the direction of the force for a very specific case, consider a plane electromagnetic wave incident on
a metal in which electron motion, as part of a current, is damped by the resistance of the metal, so that the average
676  16 · Electromagnetic Waves

     electron motion is in phase with the force causing it. This is comparable to an object moving against friction and
     stopping as soon as the force pushing it stops (Figure 16.13). When the electric field is in the direction of the
     positive y-axis, electrons move in the negative y-direction, with the magnetic field in the direction of the positive
     z-axis. By applying the right-hand rule, and accounting for the negative charge of the electron, we can see that the
     force on the electron from the magnetic field is in the direction of the positive x-axis, which is the direction of wave
     propagation. When the E field reverses, the B field does too, and the force is again in the same direction. Maxwell's
     equations together with the Lorentz force equation imply the existence of radiation pressure much more generally
     than this specific example, however.

     FIGURE 16.13 Electric and magnetic fields of an electromagnetic wave can combine to produce a force in the direction of propagation, as
     illustrated for the special case of electrons whose motion is highly damped by the resistance of a metal.

     Maxwell predicted that an electromagnetic wave carries momentum. An object absorbing an electromagnetic wave
     would experience a force in the direction of propagation of the wave. The force corresponds to radiation pressure
     exerted on the object by the wave. The force would be twice as great if the radiation were reflected rather than
     absorbed.
     Maxwell's prediction was confirmed in 1903 by Nichols and Hull by precisely measuring radiation pressures with a
     torsion balance. The schematic arrangement is shown in Figure 16.14. The mirrors suspended from a fiber were
     housed inside a glass container. Nichols and Hull were able to obtain a small measurable deflection of the mirrors
     from shining light on one of them. From the measured deflection, they could calculate the unbalanced force on the
     mirror, and obtained agreement with the predicted value of the force.

     FIGURE 16.14 Simplified diagram of the central part of the apparatus Nichols and Hull used to precisely measure radiation pressure and
     confirm Maxwell's prediction.

     The radiation pressure applied by an electromagnetic wave on a perfectly absorbing surface turns out to be
     equal to the energy density of the wave:

                                                                                                                                                        16.34
     If the material is perfectly reflecting, such as a metal surface, and if the incidence is along the normal to the surface,
     then the pressure exerted is twice as much because the momentum direction reverses upon reflection:

                                                                                                                                                        16.35

                                                                              16.4 · Momentum and Radiation Pressure                                      677

We can confirm that the units are right:

Equation 16.34 and Equation 16.35 give the instantaneous pressure, but because the energy density oscillates
rapidly, we are usually interested in the time-averaged radiation pressure, which can be written in terms of intensity:

                                                                                                                                                   16.36

Radiation pressure plays a role in explaining many observed astronomical phenomena, including the appearance of
comets. Comets are basically chunks of icy material in which frozen gases and particles of rock and dust are
embedded. When a comet approaches the Sun, it warms up and its surface begins to evaporate. The coma of the
comet is the hazy area around it from the gases and dust. Some of the gases and dust form tails when they leave the
comet. Notice in Figure 16.15 that a comet has two tails. The ion tail (or gas tail in Figure 16.15) is composed mainly
of ionized gases. These ions interact electromagnetically with the solar wind, which is a continuous stream of
charged particles emitted by the Sun. The force of the solar wind on the ionized gases is strong enough that the ion
tail almost always points directly away from the Sun. The second tail is composed of dust particles. Because the
dust tail is electrically neutral, it does not interact with the solar wind. However, this tail is affected by the radiation
pressure produced by the light from the Sun. Although quite small, this pressure is strong enough to cause the dust
tail to be displaced from the path of the comet.

(a) Calculate the radiation pressure on the comet at this point in its orbit. Assume that the comet reflects all the
incident light.

(b) Suppose that a 10-kg chunk of material of cross-sectional area            breaks loose from the comet.
678  16 · Electromagnetic Waves

     Calculate the force on this chunk due to the solar radiation. Compare this force with the gravitational force of the
     Sun.

     Strategy
     Calculate the intensity of solar radiation at the given distance from the Sun and use that to calculate the radiation
     pressure. From the pressure and area, calculate the force.

     Solution

     a. The intensity of the solar radiation is the average solar power per unit area. Hence, at  from the
          center of the Sun, we have

          Assuming the comet reflects all the incident radiation, we obtain from Equation 16.36
     b. The force on the chunk due to the radiation is

          whereas the gravitational force of the Sun is

     Significance
     The gravitational force of the Sun on the chunk is therefore much greater than the force of the radiation.

     After Maxwell showed that light carried momentum as well as energy, a novel idea eventually emerged, initially only
     as science fiction. Perhaps a spacecraft with a large reflecting light sail could use radiation pressure for propulsion.
     Such a vehicle would not have to carry fuel. It would experience a constant but small force from solar radiation,
     instead of the short bursts from rocket propulsion. It would accelerate slowly, but by being accelerated
     continuously, it would eventually reach great speeds. A spacecraft with small total mass and a sail with a large area
     would be necessary to obtain a usable acceleration.

     When the space program began in the 1960s, the idea started to receive serious attention from NASA. The most
     recent development in light propelled spacecraft has come from a citizen-funded group, the Planetary Society. It is
     currently testing the use of light sails to propel a small vehicle built from CubeSats, tiny satellites that NASA places
     in orbit for various research projects during space launches intended mainly for other purposes.

     The LightSail spacecraft shown below (Figure 16.16) consists of three CubeSats bundled together. It has a total
     mass of only about 5 kg and is about the size as a loaf of bread. Its sails are made of very thin Mylar and open after
     launch to have a surface area of

     INTERACTIVE

The first LightSail spacecraft was launched in 2015 to test the sail deployment system. It was placed in low-earth
orbit in 2015 by hitching a ride on an Atlas 5 rocket launched for an unrelated mission. The test was successful, but
the low-earth orbit allowed too much drag on the spacecraft to accelerate it by sunlight. Eventually, it burned in the
atmosphere, as expected. The next Planetary Society's LightSail solar sailing spacecraft is scheduled for 2016. An
illustration (https://openstax.org/l/21lightsail) of the spacecraft, as it is expected to appear in flight, can be seen on
the Planetary Society's website.

EXAMPLE 16.7

LightSail Acceleration

The intensity of energy from sunlight at a distance of 1 AU from the Sun is  . The LightSail spacecraft has

sails with total area of       and a total mass of 5.0 kg. Calculate the maximum acceleration LightSail spacecraft

could achieve from radiation pressure when it is about 1 AU from the Sun.

Strategy

The maximum acceleration can be expected when the sail is opened directly facing the Sun. Use the light intensity
to calculate the radiation pressure and from it, the force on the sails. Then use Newton's second law to calculate the
acceleration.

Solution
The radiation pressure is

The resulting acceleration is

     If this small acceleration continued for a year, the craft would attain a speed of 1829 m/s, or 6600 km/h.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how electromagnetic waves are divided into different ranges, depending on wavelength and
             corresponding frequency

         · Describe how electromagnetic waves in different categories are produced
         · Describe some of the many practical everyday applications of electromagnetic waves

     Electromagnetic waves have a vast range of practical everyday applications that includes such diverse uses as
     communication by cell phone and radio broadcasting, WiFi, cooking, vision, medical imaging, and treating cancer. In
     this module, we discuss how electromagnetic waves are classified into categories such as radio, infrared, ultraviolet,
     and so on. We also summarize some of the main applications for each range.

     The different categories of electromagnetic waves differ in their wavelength range, or equivalently, in their
     corresponding frequency ranges. Their properties change smoothly from one frequency range to the next, with
     different applications in each range. A brief overview of the production and utilization of electromagnetic waves is
     found in Table 16.1.

TABLE 16.1 Electromagnetic Waves

The relationship  between frequency f and wavelength applies to all waves and ensures that greater

frequency means smaller wavelength. Figure 16.17 shows how the various types of electromagnetic waves are

categorized according to their wavelengths and frequencies--that is, it shows the electromagnetic spectrum.

         FIGURE 16.17 The electromagnetic spectrum, showing the major categories of electromagnetic waves.

Radio Waves

The term radio waves refers to electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths greater than about 0.1 m. Radio waves
are commonly used for audio communications (i.e., for radios), but the term is used for electromagnetic waves in
this range regardless of their application. Radio waves typically result from an alternating current in the wires of a
broadcast antenna. They cover a very broad wavelength range and are divided into many subranges, including
microwaves, electromagnetic waves used for AM and FM radio, cellular telephones, and TV signals.

There is no lowest frequency of radio waves, but ELF waves, or "extremely low frequency" are among the lowest
frequencies commonly encountered, from 3 Hz to 3 kHz. The accelerating charge in the ac currents of electrical
power lines produce electromagnetic waves in this range. ELF waves are able to penetrate sea water, which strongly
absorbs electromagnetic waves of higher frequency, and therefore are useful for submarine communications.

In order to use an electromagnetic wave to transmit information, the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the wave is

modulated, or varied in a controlled way that encodes the intended information into the wave. In AM radio

transmission, the amplitude of the wave is modulated to mimic the vibrations of the sound being conveyed. Fourier's

theorem implies that the modulated AM wave amounts to a superposition of waves covering some narrow frequency

range. Each AM station is assigned a specific carrier frequency that, by international agreement, is allowed to vary

by       . In FM radio transmission, the frequency of the wave is modulated to carry this information, as illustrated
682  16 · Electromagnetic Waves

     in Figure 16.18, and the frequency of each station is allowed to use 100 kHz on each side of its carrier frequency.
     The electromagnetic wave produces a current in a receiving antenna, and the radio or television processes the signal
     to produce the sound and any image. The higher the frequency of the radio wave used to carry the data, the greater
     the detailed variation of the wave that can be carried by modulating it over each time unit, and the more data that
     can be transmitted per unit of time. The assigned frequencies for AM broadcasting are 540 to 1600 kHz, and for FM
     are 88 MHz to108 MHz.

     FIGURE 16.18 Electromagnetic waves are used to carry communications signals by varying the wave's amplitude (AM), its frequency (FM),
     or its phase.

     Cell phone conversations, and television voice and video images are commonly transmitted as digital data, by
     converting the signal into a sequence of binary ones and zeros. This allows clearer data transmission when the
     signal is weak, and allows using computer algorithms to compress the digital data to transmit more data in each
     frequency range. Computer data as well is transmitted as a sequence of binary ones and zeros, each one or zero
     constituting one bit of data.

     Microwaves

     Microwaves are the highest-frequency electromagnetic waves that can be produced by currents in macroscopic

     circuits and devices. Microwave frequencies range from about  to nearly  . Their high frequencies

     correspond to short wavelengths compared with other radio waves--hence the name "microwave." Microwaves also

     occur naturally as the cosmic background radiation left over from the origin of the universe. Along with other ranges

     of electromagnetic waves, they are part of the radiation that any object above absolute zero emits and absorbs

     because of thermal agitation, that is, from the thermal motion of its atoms and molecules.

     Most satellite-transmitted information is carried on microwaves. Radar is a common application of microwaves. By
     detecting and timing microwave echoes, radar systems can determine the distance to objects as diverse as clouds,
     aircraft, or even the surface of Venus.

     Microwaves of 2.45 GHz are commonly used in microwave ovens. The electrons in a water molecule tend to remain
     closer to the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nuclei (Figure 16.19). This creates two separated centers of equal
     and opposite charges, giving the molecule a dipole moment (see Electric Field). The oscillating electric field of the
     microwaves inside the oven exerts a torque that tends to align each molecule first in one direction and then in the
     other, with the motion of each molecule coupled to others around it. This pumps energy into the continual thermal
     motion of the water to heat the food. The plate under the food contains no water, and remains relatively unheated.

them. The and denote the charge distribution on the molecules.

The microwaves in a microwave oven reflect off the walls of the oven, so that the superposition of waves produces
standing waves, similar to the standing waves of a vibrating guitar or violin string (see Normal Modes of a Standing
Sound Wave (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/17-4-normal-modes-of-a-standing-
sound-wave)). A rotating fan acts as a stirrer by reflecting the microwaves in different directions, and food
turntables, help spread out the hot spots.

        EXAMPLE 16.8

Why Microwave Ovens Heat Unevenly

How far apart are the hotspots in a 2.45-GHz microwave oven?

Strategy
Consider the waves along one direction in the oven, being reflected at the opposite wall from where they are
generated.

Solution
The antinodes, where maximum intensity occurs, are half the wavelength apart, with separation

Significance
The distance between the hot spots in a microwave oven are determined by the wavelength of the microwaves.

A cell phone has a radio receiver and a weak radio transmitter, both of which can quickly tune to hundreds of
specifically assigned microwave frequencies. The low intensity of the transmitted signal gives it an intentionally
limited range. A ground-based system links the phone to only to the broadcast tower assigned to the specific small
area, or cell, and smoothly transitions its connection to the next cell when the signal reception there is the stronger
one. This enables a cell phone to be used while changing location.

Microwaves also provide the WiFi that enables owners of cell phones, laptop computers, and similar devices to
connect wirelessly to the Internet at home and at coffee shops and airports. A wireless WiFi router is a device that
exchanges data over the Internet through the cable or another connection, and uses microwaves to exchange the
data wirelessly with devices such as cell phones and computers. The term WiFi itself refers to the standards
followed in modulating and analyzing the microwaves so that wireless routers and devices from different
manufacturers work compatibly with one another. The computer data in each direction consist of sequences of
binary zeros and ones, each corresponding to a binary bit. The microwaves are in the range of 2.4 GHz to 5.0 GHz
range.
684  16 · Electromagnetic Waves

     Other wireless technologies also use microwaves to provide everyday communications between devices. Bluetooth
     developed alongside WiFi as a standard for radio communication in the 2.4-GHz range between nearby devices, for
     example, to link to headphones and audio earpieces to devices such as radios, or a driver's cell phone to a hands-
     free device to allow answering phone calls without fumbling directly with the cell phone.

     Microwaves find use also in radio tagging, using RFID (radio frequency identification) technology. Examples are RFID
     tags attached to store merchandize, transponder for toll booths use attached to the windshield of a car, or even a
     chip embedded into a pet's skin. The device responds to a microwave signal by emitting a signal of its own with
     encoded information, allowing stores to quickly ring up items at their cash registers, drivers to charge tolls to their
     account without stopping, and lost pets to be reunited with their owners. NFC (near field communication) works
     similarly, except it is much shorter range. Its mechanism of interaction is the induced magnetic field at microwave
     frequencies between two coils. Cell phones that have NFC capability and the right software can supply information
     for purchases using the cell phone instead of a physical credit card. The very short range of the data transfer is a
     desired security feature in this case.

     Infrared Radiation

     The boundary between the microwave and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum is not well defined (see
     Figure 16.17). Infrared radiation is generally produced by thermal motion, and the vibration and rotation of atoms
     and molecules. Electronic transitions in atoms and molecules can also produce infrared radiation. About half of the
     solar energy arriving at Earth is in the infrared region, with most of the rest in the visible part of the spectrum. About
     23% of the solar energy is absorbed in the atmosphere, about 48% is absorbed at Earth's surface, and about 29% is
     reflected back into space.1

     The range of infrared frequencies extends up to the lower limit of visible light, just below red. In fact, infrared means
     "below red." Water molecules rotate and vibrate particularly well at infrared frequencies. Reconnaissance satellites
     can detect buildings, vehicles, and even individual humans by their infrared emissions, whose power radiation is
     proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. More mundanely, we use infrared lamps, including
     those called quartz heaters, to preferentially warm us because we absorb infrared better than our surroundings.

     The familiar handheld "remotes" for changing channels and settings on television sets often transmit their signal by
     modulating an infrared beam. If you try to use a TV remote without the infrared emitter being in direct line of sight
     with the infrared detector, you may find the television not responding. Some remotes use Bluetooth instead and
     reduce this annoyance.

     Visible Light

     Visible light is the narrow segment of the electromagnetic spectrum between about 400 nm and about 750 nm to
     which the normal human eye responds. Visible light is produced by vibrations and rotations of atoms and molecules,
     as well as by electronic transitions within atoms and molecules. The receivers or detectors of light largely utilize
     electronic transitions.

     Red light has the lowest frequencies and longest wavelengths, whereas violet has the highest frequencies and
     shortest wavelengths (Figure 16.20). Blackbody radiation from the Sun peaks in the visible part of the spectrum but
     is more intense in the red than in the violet, making the sun yellowish in appearance.

     FIGURE 16.20 A small part of the electromagnetic spectrum that includes its visible components. The divisions between infrared, visible,
     and ultraviolet are not perfectly distinct, nor are those between the seven rainbow colors.

     Living things--plants and animals--have evolved to utilize and respond to parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in
     which they are embedded. We enjoy the beauty of nature through visible light. Plants are more selective.

Photosynthesis uses parts of the visible spectrum to make sugars.

Ultraviolet Radiation

Ultraviolet means "above violet." The electromagnetic frequencies of ultraviolet radiation (UV) extend upward from
violet, the highest-frequency visible light. The highest-frequency ultraviolet overlaps with the lowest-frequency X-
rays. The wavelengths of ultraviolet extend from 400 nm down to about 10 nm at its highest frequencies. Ultraviolet
is produced by atomic and molecular motions and electronic transitions.

UV radiation from the Sun is broadly subdivided into three wavelength ranges: UV-A (320-400 nm) is the lowest
frequency, then UV-B (290-320 nm) and UV-C (220-290 nm). Most UV-B and all UV-C are absorbed by ozone ( )
molecules in the upper atmosphere. Consequently, 99% of the solar UV radiation reaching Earth's surface is UV-A.

Sunburn is caused by large exposures to UV-B and UV-C, and repeated exposure can increase the likelihood of skin
cancer. The tanning response is a defense mechanism in which the body produces pigments in inert skin layers to
reduce exposure of the living cells below. However, tanning is not sufficient protection, and people are generally
advised to avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight and to wear sunscreen or protective clothing when outside -- even
on cloudy days.

Because it absorbs harmful UV radiation, ozone is important to many life forms and to the overall climate. Ozone is
depleted by chemicals, which can result in areas of lower concentration -- often referred to as "holes" although the
term is entirely accurate. Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland found that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were
extremely common commercial substances, were responsible for ozone depletion. UV radiation itself broke down
CFCs, releasing chlorine atoms that reacted with and eliminated ozone. Other substances have since been proven to
have the same effect.

As examined in a later chapter, the shorter the wavelength of light, the greater the energy change of an atom or
molecule that absorbs the light in an electronic transition. This makes short-wavelength ultraviolet light damaging to
living cells. It also explains why ultraviolet radiation is better able than visible light to cause some materials to glow,
or fluoresce.

Besides the adverse effects of ultraviolet radiation, there are also benefits of exposure in nature and uses in
technology. Vitamin D production in the skin results from exposure to UV-B radiation, generally from sunlight.
Several studies suggest vitamin D deficiency is associated with the development of a range of cancers (prostate,
breast, colon), as well as osteoporosis. Low-intensity ultraviolet has applications such as providing the energy to
cause certain dyes to fluoresce and emit visible light, for example, in printed money to display hidden watermarks
as counterfeit protection.

One of the first illustrations of UV light's impact on Earth occurred during the Apollo 16 mission in 1972. The mission
included the first astronomical images taken from the moon, using a compact and resilient Far Ultraviolet Camera/
Spectrograph designed for moon use by scientist and inventor George Robert Carruthers. Designed to capture UV
images without the obscuring effects of the Earth's atmosphere, its most famous image was of the planet itself.
Carruthers, who also trained the astronauts on the device's use, mentioned afterward that "the most immediately
obvious and spectacular results were really for the Earth observations, because this was the first time that the Earth
had been photographed from a distance in ultraviolet (UV) light, so that you could see the full extent of the hydrogen
atmosphere, the polar auroris and what we call the tropical airglow belt."

X-Rays

X-rays have wavelengths from about  . They have shorter wavelengths, and higher frequencies,

than ultraviolet, so that the energy they transfer at an atomic level is greater. As a result, X-rays have adverse effects

on living cells similar to those of ultraviolet radiation, but they are more penetrating. Cancer and genetic defects can

be induced by X-rays. Because of their effect on rapidly dividing cells, X-rays can also be used to treat and even cure

cancer.

The widest use of X-rays is for imaging objects that are opaque to visible light, such as the human body or aircraft
parts. In humans, the risk of cell damage is weighed carefully against the benefit of the diagnostic information
obtained.

     Gamma Rays

     Soon after nuclear radioactivity was first detected in 1896, it was found that at least three distinct types of radiation
     were being emitted, and these were designated as alpha, beta, and gamma rays. The most penetrating nuclear
     radiation, the gamma ray ( ray), was later found to be an extremely high-frequency electromagnetic wave.

     The lower end of the ray frequency range overlaps the upper end of the X-ray range. Gamma rays have
     characteristics identical to X-rays of the same frequency--they differ only in source. The name "gamma rays" is
     generally used for electromagnetic radiation emitted by a nucleus, while X-rays are generally produced by
     bombarding a target with energetic electrons in an X-ray tube. At higher frequencies, rays are more penetrating
     and more damaging to living tissue. They have many of the same uses as X-rays, including cancer therapy. Gamma
     radiation from radioactive materials is used in nuclear medicine.

          INTERACTIVE

     Engage the Phet simulation below to explore how light interacts with molecules in our atmosphere. Notice that the
     absorption of light depends on the molecule and the type of light. Then, relate the energy of the light to the resulting
     motion. Notice that energy increases from microwave to ultraviolet. Lastly, predict the motion of a molecule based
     on the type of light it absorbs.

ANSWER KEY

Chapter 1

Check Your Understanding

1.1 The actual amount (mass) of gasoline left in the tank when the gauge hits "empty" is less in the summer than

     in the winter. The gasoline has the same volume as it does in the winter when the "add fuel" light goes on, but

     because the gasoline has expanded, there is less mass.

1.2 Not necessarily, as the thermal stress is also proportional to Young's modulus.

1.3 To a good approximation, the heat transfer depends only on the temperature difference. Since the

     temperature differences are the same in both cases, the same 25 kJ is necessary in the second case. (As we

     will see in the next section, the answer would have been different if the object had been made of some

     substance that changes phase anywhere between           and  .)

1.4 The ice and liquid water are in thermal equilibrium, so that the temperature stays at the freezing temperature

     as long as ice remains in the liquid. (Once all of the ice melts, the water temperature will start to rise.)

1.5 Snow is formed from ice crystals and thus is the solid phase of water. Because enormous heat is necessary for

     phase changes, it takes a certain amount of time for this heat to be transferred from the air, even if the air is

     above .

1.6 Conduction: Heat transfers into your hands as you hold a hot cup of coffee. Convection: Heat transfers as the

     barista "steams" cold milk to make hot cocoa. Radiation: Heat transfers from the Sun to a jar of water with tea

     leaves in it to make "Sun tea." A great many other answers are possible.

1.7 Because area is the product of two spatial dimensions, it increases by a factor of four when each dimension is

     doubled                                    . The distance, however, simply doubles. Because the

     temperature difference and the coefficient of thermal conductivity are independent of the spatial dimensions,

     the rate of heat transfer by conduction increases by a factor of four divided by two, or two:

                                                                               .

1.8 Using a fan increases the flow of air: Warm air near your body is replaced by cooler air from elsewhere.

     Convection increases the rate of heat transfer so that moving air "feels" cooler than still air.

1.9 The radiated heat is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. Because                     and

              , the rate of heat transfer increases by about 30% of the original rate.

Conceptual Questions

1. They are at the same temperature, and if they are placed in contact, no net heat flows between them.

3. The reading will change.

5. The cold water cools part of the inner surface, making it contract, while the rest remains expanded. The strain

     is too great for the strength of the material. Pyrex contracts less, so it experiences less strain.

7. In principle, the lid expands more than the jar because metals have higher coefficients of expansion than

     glass. That should make unscrewing the lid easier. (In practice, getting the lid and jar wet may make gripping

     them more difficult.)

9. After being heated, the length is (          ) ( ). After being cooled, the length is

                                     . That answer is not 1 m, but it should be. The explanation is that even if is

     exactly constant, the relation             is strictly true only in the limit of small . Since values are

     small, the discrepancy is unimportant in practice.

11. Temperature differences cause heat transfer.

13. No, it is stored as thermal energy. A thermodynamic system does not have a well-defined quantity of heat.

15. It raises the boiling point, so the water, which the food gains heat from, is at a higher temperature.

17. Yes, by raising the pressure above 56 atm.

19. work

21.       (at or near atmospheric pressure)
720 Answer Key

23. Condensation releases heat, so it speeds up the melting.
25. Because of water's high specific heat, it changes temperature less than land. Also, evaporation reduces

      temperature rises. The air tends to stay close to equilibrium with the water, so its temperature does not
      change much where there's a lot of water around, as in San Francisco but not Sacramento.
27. The liquid is oxygen, whose boiling point is above that of nitrogen but whose melting point is below the boiling
      point of liquid nitrogen. The crystals that sublime are carbon dioxide, which has no liquid phase at
      atmospheric pressure. The crystals that melt are water, whose melting point is above carbon dioxide's
      sublimation point. The water came from the instructor's breath.
29. Increasing circulation to the surface will warm the person, as the temperature of the water is warmer than
      human body temperature. Sweating will cause no evaporative cooling under water or in the humid air
      immediately above the tub.
31. It spread the heat over the area above the heating elements, evening the temperature there, but does not
      spread the heat much beyond the heating elements.
33. Heat is conducted from the fire through the fire box to the circulating air and then convected by the air into
      the room (forced convection).
35. The tent is heated by the Sun and transfers heat to you by all three processes, especially radiation.
37. If shielded, it measures the air temperature. If not, it measures the combined effect of air temperature and
      net radiative heat gain from the Sun.
39. Turn the thermostat down. To have the house at the normal temperature, the heating system must replace all
      the heat that was lost. For all three mechanisms of heat transfer, the greater the temperature difference
      between inside and outside, the more heat is lost and must be replaced. So the house should be at the lowest
      temperature that does not allow freezing damage.
41. Air is a good insulator, so there is little conduction, and the heated air rises, so there is little convection
      downward.

                      So, substituting, we have                                                   . Partially solving and

     rearranging the equation, we have                        . Therefore,                        .

49. Using Table 1.2 to find the coefficient of thermal expansion of marble:

                                                                                                     .

     (Answer rounded to five significant figures to show the slight difference in height.)

51. We use instead of since this is a volume expansion with constant surface area. Therefore:

                                                                                .

53. On the warmer day, our tape measure will expand linearly. Therefore, each measured dimension will be

     smaller than the actual dimension of the land. Calling these measured dimensions and , we will find a

     new area, A. Let's calculate these measured dimensions:

                                                                       ;

      Because the area gets smaller, the price of the land decreases by about $17,000.
55. a. Use Table 1.2 to find the coefficients of thermal expansion of steel and aluminum. Then

                                                                                                                                                      .

73. a.                 ; b.             ; c. The ice is much more effective in absorbing heat because it first must be

     melted, which requires a lot of energy, and then it gains the same amount of heat as the bag that started with

     water. The first             of heat is used to melt the ice, then it absorbs the              of heat as

     water.

81. a. 9.35 L; b. Crude oil is less dense than water, so it floats on top of the water, thereby exposing it to the

     oxygen in the air, which it uses to burn. Also, if the water is under the oil, it is less able to absorb the heat

     generated by the oil.

85. First bring the ice up to     and melt it with heat          4.74 kcal. This lowers the temperature of water by

                       . Now, the heat lost by the hot water equals that gained by the cold water ( is the final

     temperature):

101. We found in the preceding problem that                         as baseline energy use. So the total heat loss
        during this period is                                                                                          . At the

      cost of $1/MJ, the cost is $1960. From an earlier problem, the savings is 12% or $235/y. We need                 of

 2.1 We first need to calculate the molar mass (the mass of one mole) of niacin. To do this, we must multiply the
        number of atoms of each element in the molecule by the element's molar mass.

      Then we need to calculate the number of moles in 14 mg.

      Then, we use Avogadro's number to calculate the number of molecules:

2.2 The density of a gas is equal to a constant, the average molecular mass, times the number density N/V. From

      the ideal gas law,               we see that             Therefore, at constant temperature, if the density

      and, consequently, the number density are reduced by half, the pressure must also be reduced by half, and

2.3 Density is mass per unit volume, and volume is proportional to the size of a body (such as the radius of a
      sphere) cubed. So if the distance between molecules increases by a factor of 10, then the volume occupied
      increases by a factor of 1000, and the density decreases by a factor of 1000. Since we assume molecules are
      in contact in liquids and solids, the distance between their centers is on the order of their typical size, so the

      distance in gases is on the order of 10 times as great.
2.4 Yes. Such fluctuations actually occur for a body of any size in a gas, but since the numbers of molecules are

      immense for macroscopic bodies, the fluctuations are a tiny percentage of the number of collisions, and the
      averages spoken of in this section vary imperceptibly. Roughly speaking, the fluctuations are inversely
      proportional to the square root of the number of collisions, so for small bodies, they can become significant.
      This was actually observed in the nineteenth century for pollen grains in water and is known as Brownian
      motion.
2.5 In a liquid, the molecules are very close together, constantly colliding with one another. For a gas to be nearly
      ideal, as air is under ordinary conditions, the molecules must be very far apart. Therefore the mean free path
      is much longer in the air.
2.6 As the number of moles is equal and we know the molar heat capacities of the two gases are equal, the
      temperature is halfway between the initial temperatures, 300 K.

Conceptual Questions

1. 2 moles, as that will contain twice as many molecules as the 1 mole of oxygen

3. pressure

5. The flame contains hot gas (heated by combustion). The pressure is still atmospheric pressure, in mechanical

     equilibrium with the air around it (or roughly so). The density of the hot gas is proportional to its number

     density N/V (neglecting the difference in composition between the gas in the flame and the surrounding air).

     At higher temperature than the surrounding air, the ideal gas law says that           is less than that of

     the surrounding air. Therefore the hot air has lower density than the surrounding air and is lifted by the

     buoyant force.

7. The mean free path is inversely proportional to the square of the radius, so it decreases by a factor of 4. The

     mean free time is proportional to the mean free path and inversely proportional to the rms speed, which in

     turn is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass. That gives a factor of in the numerator, so

     the mean free time decreases by a factor of

9. Since they're more massive, their gravity is stronger, so the escape velocity from them is higher. Since they're

     farther from the Sun, they're colder, so the speeds of atmospheric molecules including hydrogen and helium

     are lower. The combination of those facts means that relatively few hydrogen and helium molecules have

     escaped from the outer planets.

3. The temperature increases since the heat output behind the refrigerator is greater than the cooling from the

5. If we combine a perfect engine and a real refrigerator with the engine converting heat Q from the hot

     refrigerator will be         , resulting in a perfect refrigerator transferring heat from the cold reservoir

     to hot reservoir without any other effect.

7. Heat pumps can efficiently extract heat from the ground to heat on cooler days or pull heat out of the house

     on warmer days. The disadvantage of heat pumps are that they are more costly than alternatives, require

     maintenance, and will not work efficiently when temperature differences between the inside and outside are

     very large. Electric heating is much cheaper to purchase than a heat pump; however, it may be more costly to

     run depending on the electric rates and amount of usage.

9. A nuclear reactor needs to have a lower temperature to operate, so its efficiency will not be as great as a

     fossil-fuel plant. This argument does not take into consideration the amount of energy per reaction: Nuclear

     power has a far greater energy output than fossil fuels.

    9. Yes, polarization charge is induced on the conductor so that the positive charge is nearest the charged rod,
        causing an attractive force.
  11. Charging by conduction is charging by contact where charge is transferred to the object. Charging by induction

     negatively charged and point away from the plate if it were positively charged. The electric field of the parallel

     plates would be zero between them if they had the same charge, and E would be                 everywhere else. If

     the charges were opposite, the situation is reversed, zero outside the plates and        between them.

Conceptual Questions

     is zero or positive; however, the electric flux is positive, negative, or zero, depending on the definition of flux

     for the given situation.

11. No, it is produced by all charges both inside and outside the Gaussian surface.

13. No, since the situation does not have symmetry, making Gauss's law challenging to simplify.

15. Any shape of the Gaussian surface can be used. The only restriction is that the Gaussian integral must be

     calculable; therefore, a box or a cylinder are the most convenient geometrical shapes for the Gaussian

     surface.

17. No. If a metal was in a region of zero electric field, all the conduction electrons would be distributed uniformly

     throughout the metal.

19. Since the electric field is zero inside a conductor, a charge of  is induced on the inside surface of the

     cavity. This will put a charge of  on the outside surface leaving a net charge of                    on the

     is bisected by the plane sheet. Since E is perpendicular to each end and parallel to the side of the cylinder, we

7.7 Given a fixed maximum electric field strength, the potential at which a strike occurs increases with increasing

      conductor is zero. Hence, any path from a point on the surface to any point in the interior will have an

Conceptual Questions

 1. No. We can only define potential energies for conservative fields.
 3. No, though certain orderings may be simpler to compute.
 5. The electric field strength is zero because electric potential differences are directly related to the field

      strength. If the potential difference is zero, then the field strength must also be zero.
 7. Potential difference is more descriptive because it indicates that it is the difference between the electric

      potential of two points.
 9. They are very similar, but potential difference is a feature of the system; when a charge is introduced to the

      system, it will have a potential energy which may be calculated by multiplying the magnitude of the charge by
      the potential difference.

9.1 The time for 1.00 C of charge to flow would be                                 , slightly less than

      an hour. This is quite different from the 5.55 ms for the truck battery. The calculator takes a very small amount
      of energy to operate, unlike the truck's starter motor. There are several reasons that vehicles use batteries and
      not solar cells. Aside from the obvious fact that a light source to run the solar cells for a car or truck is not
      always available, the large amount of current needed to start the engine cannot easily be supplied by present-
      day solar cells. Solar cells can possibly be used to charge the batteries. Charging the battery requires a small
      amount of energy when compared to the energy required to run the engine and the other accessories such as
      the heater and air conditioner. Present day solar-powered cars are powered by solar panels, which may power
      an electric motor, instead of an internal combustion engine.
9.2 The total current needed by all the appliances in the living room (a few lamps, a television, and your laptop)
      draw less current and require less power than the refrigerator.
9.3 The diameter of the 14-gauge wire is smaller than the diameter of the 12-gauge wire. Since the drift velocity is
      inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area, the drift velocity in the 14-gauge wire is larger than the drift
      velocity in the 12-gauge wire carrying the same current. The number of electrons per cubic meter will remain
      constant.
9.4 The current density in a conducting wire increases due to an increase in current. The drift velocity is

proportional to the current      , so the drift velocity would increase.

9.5 Silver, gold, and aluminum are all used for making wires. All four materials have a high conductivity, silver
      having the highest. All four can easily be drawn into wires and have a high tensile strength, though not as high
      as copper. The obvious disadvantage of gold and silver is the cost, but silver and gold wires are used for
      special applications, such as speaker wires. Gold does not oxidize, making better connections between
      components. Aluminum wires do have their drawbacks. Aluminum has a higher resistivity than copper, so a
      larger diameter is needed to match the resistance per length of copper wires, but aluminum is cheaper than
      copper, so this is not a major drawback. Aluminum wires do not have as high of a ductility and tensile strength
      as copper, but the ductility and tensile strength is within acceptable levels. There are a few concerns that must
      be addressed in using aluminum and care must be used when making connections. Aluminum has a higher
      rate of thermal expansion than copper, which can lead to loose connections and a possible fire hazard. The
      oxidation of aluminum does not conduct and can cause problems. Special techniques must be used when
      using aluminum wires and components, such as electrical outlets, must be designed to accept aluminum
      wires.

9.6 The foil pattern stretches as the backing stretches, and the foil tracks become longer and thinner. Since the

resistance is calculated as      , the resistance increases as the foil tracks are stretched. When the

temperature changes, so does the resistivity of the foil tracks, changing the resistance. One way to combat

this is to use two strain gauges, one used as a reference and the other used to measure the strain. The two

strain gauges are kept at a constant temperature

9.7 The longer the length, the smaller the resistance. The greater the resistivity, the higher the resistance. The

larger the difference between the outer radius and the inner radius, that is, the greater the ratio between the

two, the greater the resistance. If you are attempting to maximize the resistance, the choice of the values for

these variables will depend on the application. For example, if the cable must be flexible, the choice of

materials may be limited.

9.8 Yes, Ohm's law is still valid. At every point in time the current is equal to  , so the current is also a

function of time,                .

9.9 Even though electric motors are highly efficient 10-20% of the power consumed is wasted, not being used for
      doing useful work. Most of the 10-20% of the power lost is transferred into heat dissipated by the copper

9.10  wires used to make the coils of the motor. This heat adds to the heat of the environment and adds to the
      demand on power plants providing the power. The demand on the power plant can lead to increased
      greenhouse gases, particularly if the power plant uses coal or gas as fuel.
      No, the efficiency is a very important consideration of the light bulbs, but there are many other considerations.
      As mentioned above, the cost of the bulbs and the life span of the bulbs are important considerations. For
      example, CFL bulbs contain mercury, a neurotoxin, and must be disposed of as hazardous waste. When
      replacing incandescent bulbs that are being controlled by a dimmer switch with LED, the dimmer switch may
      need to be replaced. The dimmer switches for LED lights are comparably priced to the incandescent light
      switches, but this is an initial cost which should be considered. The spectrum of light should also be
      considered, but there is a broad range of color temperatures available, so you should be able to find one that
      fits your needs. None of these considerations mentioned are meant to discourage the use of LED or CFL light
      bulbs, but they are considerations.

Conceptual Questions

 1. If a wire is carrying a current, charges enter the wire from the voltage source's positive terminal and leave at
      the negative terminal, so the total charge remains zero while the current flows through it.

 3. Using one hand will reduce the possibility of "completing the circuit" and having current run through your
      body, especially current running through your heart.

 5. Even though the electrons collide with atoms and other electrons in the wire, they travel from the negative
      terminal to the positive terminal, so they drift in one direction. Gas molecules travel in completely random
      directions.

 7. In the early years of light bulbs, the bulbs are partially evacuated to reduce the amount of heat conducted
      through the air to the glass envelope. Dissipating the heat would cool the filament, increasing the amount of
      energy needed to produce light from the filament. It also protects the glass from the heat produced from the
      hot filament. If the glass heats, it expands, and as it cools, it contacts. This expansion and contraction could
      cause the glass to become brittle and crack, reducing the life of the bulbs. Many bulbs are now partially filled
      with an inert gas. It is also useful to remove the oxygen to reduce the possibility of the filament actually
      burning. When the original filaments were replaced with more efficient tungsten filaments, atoms from the
      tungsten would evaporate off the filament at such high temperatures. The atoms collide with the atoms of the
      inert gas and land back on the filament.

 9. In carbon, resistivity increases with the amount of impurities, meaning fewer free charges. In silicon and
      germanium, impurities decrease resistivity, meaning more free electrons.

11. Copper has a lower resistivity than aluminum, so if length is the same, copper must have the smaller
      diameter.

13. Device B shows a linear relationship and the device is ohmic.
15. Although the conductors have a low resistance, the lines from the power company can be kilometers long.

      Using a high voltage reduces the current that is required to supply the power demand and that reduces line
      losses.
17. The resistor would overheat, possibly to the point of causing the resistor to burn. Fuses are commonly added
      to circuits to prevent such accidents.
19. Very low temperatures necessitate refrigeration. Some materials require liquid nitrogen to cool them below
      their critical temperatures. Other materials may need liquid helium, which is even more costly.

10.1 If a wire is connected across the terminals, the load resistance is close to zero, or at least considerably less

      than the internal resistance of the battery. Since the internal resistance is small, the current through the

      circuit will be large,                  The large current causes a high power to be dissipated by the

      internal resistance              . The power is dissipated as heat.

10.2  The equivalent resistance of nine bulbs connected in series is 9R. The current is                  If one bulb burns
10.3
      out, the equivalent resistance is 8R, and the voltage does not change, but the current increases

      As more bulbs burn out, the current becomes even higher. Eventually, the current becomes too high, burning

      out the shunt.

      The equivalent of the series circuit would be                                                   which is higher

      than the equivalent resistance of the parallel circuit               The equivalent resistor of any number of

      resistors is always higher than the equivalent resistance of the same resistors connected in parallel. The

      current through for the series circuit would be                      which is lower than the sum of the

      currents through each resistor in the parallel circuit,              This is not surprising since the equivalent

      resistance of the series circuit is higher. The current through a series connection of any number of resistors

      will always be lower than the current into a parallel connection of the same resistors, since the equivalent

      resistance of the series circuit will be higher than the parallel circuit. The power dissipated by the resistors in

      series would be                  which is lower than the power dissipated in the parallel circuit

10.4  A river, flowing horizontally at a constant rate, splits in two and flows over two waterfalls. The water molecules
10.5
10.6  are analogous to the electrons in the parallel circuits. The number of water molecules that flow in the river

      and falls must be equal to the number of molecules that flow over each waterfall, just like sum of the current

      through each resistor must be equal to the current flowing into the parallel circuit. The water molecules in the

      river have energy due to their motion and height. The potential energy of the water molecules in the river is

      constant due to their equal heights. This is analogous to the constant change in voltage across a parallel

      circuit. Voltage is the potential energy across each resistor.

      The analogy quickly breaks down when considering the energy. In the waterfall, the potential energy is

      converted into kinetic energy of the water molecules. In the case of electrons flowing through a resistor, the

      potential drop is converted into heat and light, not into the kinetic energy of the electrons.

      1. All the overhead lighting circuits are in parallel and connected to the main supply line, so when one bulb

      containing the compressor and the circuit containing the lighting circuit are in parallel, but there is a switch in

      series with the light. A thermostat controls a switch that is in series with the compressor to control the

      temperature of the refrigerator.

      The circuit can be analyzed using Kirchhoff's loop rule. The first voltage source supplies power:

                               The second voltage source consumes power:

10.7  The current calculated would be equal to  instead of                     The sum of the power
10.8
      dissipated and the power consumed would still equal the power supplied.

      Since digital meters require less current than analog meters, they alter the circuit less than analog meters.

      Their resistance as a voltmeter can be far greater than an analog meter, and their resistance as an ammeter

      can be far less than an analog meter. Consult Figure 10.36 and Figure 10.35 and their discussion in the text.

Conceptual Questions

1. Some of the energy being used to recharge the battery will be dissipated as heat by the internal resistance.

3.

5. It would probably be better to be in series because the current will be less than if it were in parallel.
7. two filaments, a low resistance and a high resistance, connected in parallel
9. It can be redrawn.

  11. In series the voltages add, but so do the internal resistances, because the internal resistances are in series.
        In parallel, the terminal voltage is the same, but the equivalent internal resistance is smaller than the
        smallest individual internal resistance and a higher current can be provided.

  13. The voltmeter would put a large resistance in series with the circuit, significantly changing the circuit. It
        would probably give a reading, but it would be meaningless.

  15. The ammeter has a small resistance; therefore, a large current will be produced and could damage the meter
        and/or overheat the battery.

  17. The time constant can be shortened by using a smaller resistor and/or a smaller capacitor. Care should be
        taken when reducing the resistance because the initial current will increase as the resistance decreases.

  19. Not only might water drip into the switch and cause a shock, but also the resistance of your body is lower
        when you are wet.

Conceptual Questions

 1. Both are field dependent. Electrical force is dependent on charge, whereas magnetic force is dependent on
      current or rate of charge flow.

 3. The magnitude of the proton and electron magnetic forces are the same since they have the same amount of
      charge. The direction of these forces however are opposite of each other. The accelerations are opposite in
      direction and the electron has a larger acceleration than the proton due to its smaller mass.

 5. The magnetic field must point parallel or anti-parallel to the velocity.
 7. A compass points toward the north pole of an electromagnet.
 9. Velocity and magnetic field can be set together in any direction. If there is a force, the velocity is

      perpendicular to it. The magnetic field is also perpendicular to the force if it exists.
11. A force on a wire is exerted by an external magnetic field created by a wire or another magnet.
13. Poor conductors have a lower charge carrier density, n, which, based on the Hall effect formula, relates to a

Conceptual Questions

1. Biot-Savart law's advantage is that it works with any magnetic field produced by a current loop. The
    disadvantage is that it can take a long time.

3. If you were to go to the start of a line segment and calculate the angle to be approximately , the wire can
754 Answer Key

      be considered infinite. This judgment is based also on the precision you need in the result.
 5. You would make sure the currents flow perpendicular to one another.
 7. A magnetic field line gives the direction of the magnetic field at any point in space. The density of magnetic

      field lines indicates the strength of the magnetic field.
 9. The spring reduces in length since each coil will have a north pole-produced magnetic field next to a south

      pole of the next coil.
11. Ampère's law is valid for all closed paths, but it is not useful for calculating fields when the magnetic field

      produced lacks symmetry that can be exploited by a suitable choice of path.
13. If there is no current inside the loop, there is no magnetic field (see Ampère's law). Outside the pipe, there

      may be an enclosed current through the copper pipe, so the magnetic field may not be zero outside the pipe.
15. The bar magnet will then become two magnets, each with their own north and south poles. There are no

17. Positive charges on the wings would be to the west, or to the left of the pilot while negative charges would be

      hand tips would be negative.
19. The work is greater than the kinetic energy because it takes energy to counteract the induced emf.
21. The conducting sheet is shielded from the changing magnetic fields by creating an induced emf. This induced
      emf creates an induced magnetic field that opposes any changes in magnetic fields from the field underneath.
      Therefore, there is no net magnetic field in the region above this sheet. If the field were due to a static
      magnetic field, no induced emf will be created since you need a changing magnetic flux to induce an emf.
      Therefore, this static magnetic field will not be shielded.
23. a. zero induced current, zero force; b. clockwise induced current, force is to the left; c. zero induced current,

Conceptual Questions

1.

3. The induced current from the 12-V battery goes through an inductor, generating a large voltage.

5. Self-inductance is proportional to the magnetic flux and inversely proportional to the current. However, since

     the magnetic flux depends on the current I, these effects cancel out. This means that the self-inductance

     does not depend on the current. If the emf is induced across an element, it does depend on how the current

     changes with time.

7. Consider the ends of a wire a part of an RL circuit and determine the self-inductance from this circuit.

9. The magnetic field will flare out at the end of the solenoid so there is less flux through the last turn than

     through the middle of the solenoid.

11. As current flows through the inductor, there is a back current by Lenz's law that is created to keep the net

     current at zero amps, the initial current.

13. no

15. At          , or when the switch is first thrown.

17. 1/4

19. Initially,              and   , and after a long time has passed,        and  .

21. yes
23. The amplitude of energy oscillations depend on the initial energy of the system. The frequency in a LC circuit

      depends on the values of inductance and capacitance.
25. This creates an RLC circuit that dissipates energy, causing oscillations to decrease in amplitude slowly or

      quickly depending on the value of resistance.
27. You would have to pick out a resistance that is small enough so that only one station at a time is picked up,

      but big enough so that the tuner doesn't have to be set at exactly the correct frequency. The inductance or
      capacitance would have to be varied to tune into the station however practically speaking, variable capacitors
      are a lot easier to build in a circuit.

      They fall into different ranges of wavelength, and therefore also different corresponding ranges of frequency.

Conceptual Questions

1. The current into the capacitor to change the electric field between the plates is equal to the displacement
    current between the plates.

3. The first demonstration requires simply observing the current produced in a wire that experiences a changing
    magnetic field. The second demonstration requires moving electric charge from one location to another, and
    therefore involves electric currents that generate a changing electric field. The magnetic fields from these
    currents are not easily separated from the magnetic field that the displacement current produces.

5. in (a), because the electric field is parallel to the wire, accelerating the electrons
7. A steady current in a dc circuit will not produce electromagnetic waves. If the magnitude of the current varies

    while remaining in the same direction, the wires will emit electromagnetic waves, for example, if the current
    is turned on or off.

9. The amount of energy (about       ) is can quickly produce a considerable change in temperature, but

      the light pressure (about                   ) is much too small to notice.

11. It has the magnitude of the energy flux and points in the direction of wave propagation. It gives the direction

      of energy flow and the amount of energy per area transported per second.

13. The force on a surface acting over time is the momentum that the force would impart to the object. The

      momentum change of the light is doubled if the light is reflected back compared with when it is absorbed, so

      the force acting on the object is twice as great.

15. a. According to the right hand rule, the direction of energy propagation would reverse. b. This would leave the

      vector , and therefore the propagation direction, the same.

17. a. Radio waves are generally produced by alternating current in a wire or an oscillating electric field between

      two plates; b. Infrared radiation is commonly produced by heated bodies whose atoms and the charges in

      them vibrate at about the right frequency.

19. a. blue; b. Light of longer wavelengths than blue passes through the air with less scattering, whereas more of

      the blue light is scattered in different directions in the sky to give it is blue color.

21. A typical antenna has a stronger response when the wires forming it are orientated parallel to the electric

      field of the radio wave.

23. No, it is very narrow and just a small portion of the overall electromagnetic spectrum.

25. Visible light is typically produced by changes of energies of electrons in randomly oriented atoms and

      molecules. Radio waves are typically emitted by an ac current flowing along a wire, that has fixed orientation

      and produces electric fields pointed in particular directions.

27. Radar can observe objects the size of an airplane and uses radio waves of about 0.5 cm in wavelength. Visible

      light can be used to view single biological cells and has wavelengths of about            .
