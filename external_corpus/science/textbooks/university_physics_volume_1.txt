Units and Measurement

FIGURE 1.1 This image might be showing any number of things. It might be a whirlpool in a tank of water or perhaps a collage of paint

and shiny beads done for art class. Without knowing the size of the object in units we all recognize, such as meters or inches, it is difficult

to know what we're looking at. In fact, this image shows the Whirlpool Galaxy (and its companion galaxy), which is about 60,000 light-

years in diameter (about  across). (credit: modification of work by S. Beckwith (STScI) Hubble Heritage Team, (STScI/AURA),

INTRODUCTION As noted in the figure caption, the chapter-opening image is of the Whirlpool Galaxy, which we
examine in the first section of this chapter. Galaxies are as immense as atoms are small, yet the same laws of
physics describe both, along with all the rest of nature--an indication of the underlying unity in the universe. The
laws of physics are surprisingly few, implying an underlying simplicity to nature's apparent complexity. In this text,
you learn about the laws of physics. Galaxies and atoms may seem far removed from your daily life, but as you begin
to explore this broad-ranging subject, you may soon come to realize that physics plays a much larger role in your life
than you first thought, no matter your life goals or career choice.
6  1 · Units and Measurement

   1.1 The Scope and Scale of Physics

   LEARNING OBJECTIVES
   By the end of this section, you will be able to:

       · Describe the scope of physics.
       · Calculate the order of magnitude of a quantity.
       · Compare measurable length, mass, and timescales quantitatively.
       · Describe the relationships among models, theories, and laws.

   Physics is devoted to the understanding of all natural phenomena. In physics, we try to understand physical
   phenomena at all scales--from the world of subatomic particles to the entire universe. Despite the breadth of the
   subject, the various subfields of physics share a common core. The same basic training in physics will prepare you to
   work in any area of physics and the related areas of science and engineering. In this section, we investigate the
   scope of physics; the scales of length, mass, and time over which the laws of physics have been shown to be
   applicable; and the process by which science in general, and physics in particular, operates.

   The Scope of Physics

   Take another look at the chapter-opening image. The Whirlpool Galaxy contains billions of individual stars as well as

   huge clouds of gas and dust. Its companion galaxy is also visible to the right. This pair of galaxies lies a staggering

   billion trillion miles           from our own galaxy (which is called the Milky Way). The stars and planets that

   make up the Whirlpool Galaxy might seem to be the furthest thing from most people's everyday lives, but the

   Whirlpool is a great starting point to think about the forces that hold the universe together. The forces that cause the

   Whirlpool Galaxy to act as it does are thought to be the same forces we contend with here on Earth, whether we are

   planning to send a rocket into space or simply planning to raise the walls for a new home. The gravity that causes

   the stars of the Whirlpool Galaxy to rotate and revolve is thought to be the same as what causes water to flow over

   hydroelectric dams here on Earth. When you look up at the stars, realize the forces out there are the same as the

   ones here on Earth. Through a study of physics, you may gain a greater understanding of the interconnectedness of

   everything we can see and know in this universe.

   Humans have created and manufactured millions of different objects. Successive technological periods (often
   referred to as the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, and so on) are marked by knowledge of the physical
   properties of certain materials and the ability to manipulate them. This knowledge all stems from physics, whether
   it's the way a rock would flake when constructing a spear point, the effect of integrating carbon with iron in South
   Indian and Sri Lankan furnaces to create the earliest high-quality steel, or the proper way to combine perfectly
   ground and polished pieces of glass to create optical instruments. Our current technological age, the Information
   Age, can be traced to critical innovations made by people from all backgrounds working together. Mohamed M.
   Atalla and Dawon Kahng, for example, invented the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor).
   Although unknown to most people, this tiny device, created in 1959 by an Egyptian-born scientist and a Korean-
   born scientist working in a lab in New Jersey (U.S.), is the basis for modern electronics. More MOSFETs have been
   produced than any other object in human history. They are used in computers, smartphones, microwave ovens,
   automotive controls, medical instruments, and nearly every other electronic device.

   Next, think about the most exciting modern technologies that you have heard about in the news, such as trains that
   levitate above tracks, "invisibility cloaks" that bend light around them, and microscopic robots that fight cancer cells
   in our bodies. All these groundbreaking advances, commonplace or unbelievable, rely on the principles of physics.
   Aside from playing a significant role in technology, professionals such as engineers, pilots, physicians, physical
   therapists, electricians, and computer programmers apply physics concepts in their daily work. For example, a pilot
   must understand how wind forces affect a flight path; a physical therapist must understand how the muscles in the
   body experience forces as they move and bend. As you will learn in this text, the principles of physics are propelling
   new, exciting technologies, and these principles are applied in a wide range of careers.

   The underlying order of nature makes science in general, and physics in particular, interesting and enjoyable to
   study. For example, what do a bag of chips and a car battery have in common? Both contain energy that can be
   converted to other forms. The law of conservation of energy (which says that energy can change form but is never
   lost) ties together such topics as food calories, batteries, heat, light, and watch springs. Understanding this law

makes it easier to learn about the various forms energy takes and how they relate to one another. Apparently
unrelated topics are connected through broadly applicable physical laws, permitting an understanding beyond just
the memorization of lists of facts.

Science consists of theories and laws that are the general truths of nature, as well as the body of knowledge they
encompass. Scientists are continuously trying to expand this body of knowledge and to perfect the expression of the
laws that describe it. Physics, which comes from the Greek phúsis, meaning "nature," is concerned with describing
the interactions of energy, matter, space, and time to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that underlie every
phenomenon. This concern for describing the basic phenomena in nature essentially defines the scope of physics.

Physics aims to understand the world around us at the most basic level. It emphasizes the use of a small number of
quantitative laws to do this, which can be useful to other fields pushing the performance boundaries of existing
technologies. Consider a smartphone (Figure 1.2). Physics describes how electricity interacts with the various
circuits inside the device. This knowledge helps engineers select the appropriate materials and circuit layout when
building a smartphone. Knowledge of the physics underlying these devices is required to shrink their size or increase
their processing speed. Or, think about a GPS. Physics describes the relationship between the speed of an object,
the distance over which it travels, and the time it takes to travel that distance. GPS relies on precise calculations that
account for variations in the Earth's landscapes, the exact distance between orbiting satellites, and even the effect
of a complex occurrence of time dilation. Most of these calculations are founded on algorithms developed by Gladys
West, a mathematician and computer scientist who programmed the first computers capable of highly accurate
remote sensing and positioning. When you use a GPS device, it utilizes these algorithms to recognize where you are
and how your position relates to other objects on Earth.

FIGURE 1.2 The Apple iPhone is a common smartphone with a GPS function. Physics describes the way that electricity flows through the
circuits of this device. Engineers use their knowledge of physics to construct an iPhone with features that consumers will enjoy. One
specific feature of an iPhone is the GPS function. A GPS uses physics equations to determine the drive time between two locations on a
map. (credit: Jane Whitney)

Knowledge of physics is useful in everyday situations as well as in nonscientific professions. It can help you
understand how microwave ovens work, why metals should not be put into them, and why they might affect
pacemakers. Physics allows you to understand the hazards of radiation and to evaluate these hazards rationally and
more easily. Physics also explains the reason why a black car radiator helps remove heat in a car engine, and it
explains why a white roof helps keep the inside of a house cool. Similarly, the operation of a car's ignition system as
well as the transmission of electrical signals throughout our body's nervous system are much easier to understand
when you think about them in terms of basic physics.

Physics is a key element of many important disciplines and contributes directly to others. Chemistry, for
8  1 · Units and Measurement

   example--since it deals with the interactions of atoms and molecules--has close ties to atomic and molecular
   physics. Most branches of engineering are concerned with designing new technologies, processes, or structures
   within the constraints set by the laws of physics. In architecture, physics is at the heart of structural stability and is
   involved in the acoustics, heating, lighting, and cooling of buildings. Parts of geology rely heavily on physics, such as
   radioactive dating of rocks, earthquake analysis, and heat transfer within Earth. Some disciplines, such as
   biophysics and geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines.

   Physics has many applications in the biological sciences. On the microscopic level, it helps describe the properties
   of cells and their environments. On the macroscopic level, it explains the heat, work, and power associated with the
   human body and its various organ systems. Physics is involved in medical diagnostics, such as radiographs,
   magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonic blood flow measurements. Medical therapy sometimes involves
   physics directly; for example, cancer radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation. Physics also explains sensory
   phenomena, such as how musical instruments make sound, how the eye detects color, and how lasers transmit
   information.

   It is not necessary to study all applications of physics formally. What is most useful is knowing the basic laws of
   physics and developing skills in the analytical methods for applying them. The study of physics also can improve
   your problem-solving skills. Furthermore, physics retains the most basic aspects of science, so it is used by all the
   sciences, and the study of physics makes other sciences easier to understand.

   The Scale of Physics

   From the discussion so far, it should be clear that to accomplish your goals in any of the various fields within the
   natural sciences and engineering, a thorough grounding in the laws of physics is necessary. The reason for this is
   simply that the laws of physics govern everything in the observable universe at all measurable scales of length,
   mass, and time. Now, that is easy enough to say, but to come to grips with what it really means, we need to get a
   little bit quantitative. So, before surveying the various scales that physics allows us to explore, let's first look at the
   concept of "order of magnitude," which we use to come to terms with the vast ranges of length, mass, and time that
   we consider in this text (Figure 1.3).

   nicknamed "The Mice" because of the tail of gas emanating from each one. They are located 300 million light-years from Earth in the
   constellation Coma Berenices. Eventually, these two galaxies will merge into one. (credit a: modification of work by

   Order of magnitude

   The order of magnitude of a number is the power of 10 that most closely approximates it. Thus, the order of

   magnitude refers to the scale (or size) of a value. Each power of 10 represents a different order of magnitude. For

   example,                   and so forth, are all different orders of magnitude, as are  and

   To find the order of magnitude of a number, take the base-10 logarithm of the number and round it to the nearest

   integer, then the order of magnitude of the number is simply the resulting power of 10. For example, the order of

   magnitude of 800 is 103 because  which rounds to 3. Similarly, the order of magnitude of 450 is

103 because  which rounds to 3 as well. Thus, we say the numbers 800 and 450 are of the same

order of magnitude: 103. However, the order of magnitude of 250 is 102 because                          which rounds

to 2.

An equivalent but quicker way to find the order of magnitude of a number is first to write it in scientific notation and

then check to see whether the first factor is greater than or less than                The idea is that

             is halfway between             and   on a log base-10 scale. Thus, if the first factor is less than

       then we round it down to 1 and the order of magnitude is simply whatever power of 10 is required to write the

number in scientific notation. On the other hand, if the first factor is greater than  then we round it up to 10 and

the order of magnitude is one power of 10 higher than the power needed to write the number in scientific notation.

For example, the number 800 can be written in scientific notation as     Because 8 is bigger than

we say the order of magnitude of 800 is           The number 450 can be written as                      so its order of
                                                                                                                  and
magnitude is also 103 because 4.5 is greater than 3. However, 250 written in scientific notation is

2.5 is less than 3, so its order of magnitude is

The order of magnitude of a number is designed to be a ballpark estimate for the scale (or size) of its value. It is

simply a way of rounding numbers consistently to the nearest (on a logarithmic scale) power of 10. In other words, if

numbers differ by one order of magnitude, the one is larger than the other by about ten. This makes doing rough

mental math with very big and very small numbers easier. For example, the diameter of a hydrogen atom is on the
order of 10-10 m, whereas the diameter of the Sun is on the order of 109 m, so it would take roughly

             hydrogen atoms to stretch across the diameter of the Sun. This is much easier to do in your head

than using the more precise values of             for a hydrogen atom diameter and                       for the

Sun's diameter, to find that it would take        hydrogen atoms to stretch across the Sun's diameter. In

addition to being easier, the rough estimate is also nearly as informative as the precise calculation.

Known ranges of length, mass, and time
The vastness of the universe and the breadth over which physics applies are illustrated by the wide range of
examples of known lengths, masses, and times (given as orders of magnitude) in Figure 1.4. Examining this table
will give you a feeling for the range of possible topics in physics and numerical values. A good way to appreciate the
vastness of the ranges of values in Figure 1.4 is to try to answer some simple comparative questions, such as the
following:

· How many hydrogen atoms does it take to stretch across the diameter of the Sun?
   (Answer: 109 m/10-10 m = 1019 hydrogen atoms)

· How many protons are there in a bacterium?
   (Answer: 10-15 kg/10-27 kg = 1012 protons)

· How many floating-point operations can a supercomputer do in 1 day?
   (Answer: 105 s/10-17 s = 1022 floating-point operations)

In studying Figure 1.4, take some time to come up with similar questions that interest you and then try answering
them. Doing this can breathe some life into almost any table of numbers.

    Building Models

    How did we come to know the laws governing natural phenomena? What we refer to as the laws of nature are
    concise descriptions of the universe around us. They are human statements of the underlying laws or rules that all
    natural processes follow. Such laws are intrinsic to the universe; humans did not create them and cannot change
    them. We can only discover and understand them. Their discovery is a very human endeavor, with all the elements
    of mystery, imagination, struggle, triumph, and disappointment inherent in any creative effort (Figure 1.5). The
    cornerstone of discovering natural laws is observation; scientists must describe the universe as it is, not as we
    imagine it to be.

A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to display directly. Although a
model is justified by experimental tests, it is only accurate in describing certain aspects of a physical system. An
example is the Bohr model of single-electron atoms, in which the electron is pictured as orbiting the nucleus,
analogous to the way planets orbit the Sun (Figure 1.6). We cannot observe electron orbits directly, but the mental
image helps explain some of the observations we can make, such as the emission of light from hot gases (atomic
spectra). However, other observations show that the picture in the Bohr model is not really what atoms look like.
The model is "wrong," but is still useful for some purposes. Physicists use models for a variety of purposes. For
example, models can help physicists analyze a scenario and perform a calculation or models can be used to
represent a situation in the form of a computer simulation. Ultimately, however, the results of these calculations and
simulations need to be double-checked by other means--namely, observation and experimentation.

FIGURE 1.6 What is a model? The Bohr model of a single-electron atom shows the electron orbiting the nucleus in one of several possible
circular orbits. Like all models, it captures some, but not all, aspects of the physical system.

The word theory means something different to scientists than what is often meant when the word is used in
everyday conversation. In particular, to a scientist a theory is not the same as a "guess" or an "idea" or even a
"hypothesis." The phrase "it's just a theory" seems meaningless and silly to scientists because science is founded
on the notion of theories. To a scientist, a theory is a testable explanation for patterns in nature supported by
scientific evidence and verified multiple times by various groups of researchers. Some theories include models to
12  1 · Units and Measurement

    help visualize phenomena whereas others do not. Newton's theory of gravity, for example, does not require a model
    or mental image, because we can observe the objects directly with our own senses. Although models are meant only
    to describe certain aspects of a physical system accurately, a theory should describe all aspects of any system that
    falls within its domain of applicability. In particular, any experimentally testable implication of a theory should be
    verified. If an experiment ever shows an implication of a theory to be false, then the theory is either thrown out or
    modified suitably (for example, by limiting its domain of applicability).

    A law uses concise language to describe a generalized pattern in nature supported by scientific evidence and
    repeated experiments. Often, a law can be expressed in the form of a single mathematical equation. Laws and
    theories are similar in that they are both scientific statements that result from a tested hypothesis and are
    supported by scientific evidence. However, the designation law is usually reserved for a concise and very general
    statement that describes phenomena in nature, such as the law that energy is conserved during any process, or
    Newton's second law of motion, which relates force (F), mass (m), and acceleration (a) by the simple equation

                A theory, in contrast, is a less concise statement of observed behavior. For example, the theory of evolution
    and the theory of relativity cannot be expressed concisely enough to be considered laws. The biggest difference
    between a law and a theory is that a theory is much more complex and dynamic. A law describes a single action
    whereas a theory explains an entire group of related phenomena. Less broadly applicable statements are usually
    called principles (such as Pascal's principle, which is applicable only in fluids), but the distinction between laws and
    principles often is not made carefully.

    The models, theories, and laws we devise sometimes imply the existence of objects or phenomena that are as yet
    unobserved. These predictions are remarkable triumphs and tributes to the power of science. It is the underlying
    order in the universe that enables scientists to make such spectacular predictions. However, if experimentation
    does not verify our predictions, then the theory or law is wrong, no matter how elegant or convenient it is. Laws can
    never be known with absolute certainty because it is impossible to perform every imaginable experiment to confirm
    a law for every possible scenario. Physicists operate under the assumption that all scientific laws and theories are
    valid until a counterexample is observed. If a good-quality, verifiable experiment contradicts a well-established law
    or theory, then the law or theory must be modified or overthrown completely.

    The study of science in general, and physics in particular, is an adventure much like the exploration of an uncharted
    ocean. Discoveries are made; models, theories, and laws are formulated; and the beauty of the physical universe is
    made more sublime for the insights gained.

    1.2 Units and Standards

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Describe how SI base units are defined.
        · Describe how derived units are created from base units.
        · Express quantities given in SI units using metric prefixes.

    As we saw previously, the range of objects and phenomena studied in physics is immense. From the incredibly short
    lifetime of a nucleus to the age of Earth, from the tiny sizes of subnuclear particles to the vast distance to the edges
    of the known universe, from the force exerted by a jumping flea to the force between Earth and the Sun, there are
    enough factors of 10 to challenge the imagination of even the most experienced scientist. Giving numerical values
    for physical quantities and equations for physical principles allows us to understand nature much more deeply than
    qualitative descriptions alone. To comprehend these vast ranges, we must also have accepted units in which to
    express them. We shall find that even in the potentially mundane discussion of meters, kilograms, and seconds, a
    profound simplicity of nature appears: all physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of only seven base
    physical units.

    We define a physical quantity either by specifying how it is measured or by stating how it is calculated from other
    measurements. For example, we might define distance and time by specifying methods for measuring them, such as
    using a meter stick and a stopwatch. Then, we could define average speed by stating that it is calculated as the total
    distance traveled divided by time of travel.

    Measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units, which are standardized values. For example,

the length of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in units of meters (for sprinters) or kilometers
(for distance runners). Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and
compare measured values in a meaningful way (Figure 1.7).

                                             FIGURE 1.7 Distances given in unknown units are maddeningly useless.

Two major systems of units are used in the world: SI units (for the French Système International d'Unités), also
known as the metric system, and English units (also known as the customary or imperial system). English units
were historically used in nations once ruled by the British Empire and are still widely used in the United States.
English units may also be referred to as the foot-pound-second (fps) system, as opposed to the
centimeter-gram-second (cgs) system. You may also encounter the term SAE units, named after the Society of
Automotive Engineers. Products such as fasteners and automotive tools (for example, wrenches) that are measured
in inches rather than metric units are referred to as SAE fasteners or SAE wrenches.

Virtually every other country in the world (except the United States) now uses SI units as the standard. The metric
system is also the standard system agreed on by scientists and mathematicians.

SI Units: Base and Derived Units

In any system of units, the units for some physical quantities must be defined through a measurement process.
These are called the base quantities for that system and their units are the system's base units. All other physical
quantities can then be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each of these physical quantities
is then known as a derived quantity and each unit is called a derived unit. The choice of base quantities is
somewhat arbitrary, as long as they are independent of each other and all other quantities can be derived from
them. Typically, the goal is to choose physical quantities that can be measured accurately to a high precision as the
base quantities. The reason for this is simple. Since the derived units can be expressed as algebraic combinations of
the base units, they can only be as accurate and precise as the base units from which they are derived.

Based on such considerations, the International Standards Organization recommends using seven base quantities,
which form the International System of Quantities (ISQ). These are the base quantities used to define the SI base
units. Table 1.1 lists these seven ISQ base quantities and the corresponding SI base units.

                                        TABLE 1.1 ISQ Base Quantities and Their SI Units

    You are probably already familiar with some derived quantities that can be formed from the base quantities in Table

    1.1. For example, the geometric concept of area is always calculated as the product of two lengths. Thus, area is a

    derived quantity that can be expressed in terms of SI base units using square meters                 Similarly,

    volume is a derived quantity that can be expressed in cubic meters  Speed is length per time; so in terms of SI

    base units, we could measure it in meters per second (m/s). Volume mass density (or just density) is mass per
    volume, which is expressed in terms of SI base units such as kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m3). Angles can also be

    thought of as derived quantities because they can be defined as the ratio of the arc length subtended by two radii of

    a circle to the radius of the circle. This is how the radian is defined. Depending on your background and interests,

    you may be able to come up with other derived quantities, such as the mass flow rate (kg/s) or volume flow rate

    (m3/s) of a fluid, electric charge  mass flux density               and so on. We will see many more examples

    throughout this text. For now, the point is that every physical quantity can be derived from the seven base quantities

    in Table 1.1, and the units of every physical quantity can be derived from the seven SI base units.

    For the most part, we use SI units in this text. Non-SI units are used in a few applications in which they are in very

    common use, such as the measurement of temperature in degrees Celsius                 the measurement of fluid volume in

    liters (L), and the measurement of energies of elementary particles in electron-volts (eV). Whenever non-SI units are

    discussed, they are tied to SI units through conversions. For example, 1 L is

    Units of Time, Length, and Mass: The Second, Meter, and Kilogram

    The initial chapters in this textbook are concerned with mechanics, fluids, and waves. In these subjects all pertinent
    physical quantities can be expressed in terms of the base units of length, mass, and time. Therefore, we now turn to
    a discussion of these three base units, leaving discussion of the others until they are needed later.

    The second
    The SI unit for time, the second (abbreviated s), has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of a
    mean solar day. More recently, a new standard was adopted to gain greater accuracy and to define the second in
    terms of a nonvarying or constant physical phenomenon (because the solar day is getting longer as a result of the
    very gradual slowing of Earth's rotation). Cesium atoms can be made to vibrate in a very steady way, and these
    vibrations can be readily observed and counted. In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for
    9,192,631,770 of these vibrations to occur (Figure 1.8). Note that this may seem like more precision than you would
    ever need, but it isn't--GPSs rely on the precision of atomic clocks to be able to give you turn-by-turn directions on
    the surface of Earth, far from the satellites broadcasting their location.

per year. The fundamental unit of time, the second, is based on such clocks. This image looks down from the top of an atomic fountain
nearly 30 feet tall. (credit: Steve Jurvetson)

The meter
The SI unit for length is the meter (abbreviated m); its definition has also changed over time to become more
precise. The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole.
This measurement was improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on
a platinum-iridium bar now kept near Paris. By 1960, it had become possible to define the meter even more
accurately in terms of the wavelength of light, so it was again redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light
emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its current definition (in part for greater accuracy) as the
distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second (Figure 1.9). This change came after knowing the
speed of light to be exactly 299,792,458 m/s.

FIGURE 1.9 The meter is defined to be the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second in a vacuum. Distance traveled is speed
multiplied by time.

The kilogram
The SI unit for mass is the kilogram (abbreviated kg); From 1795-2018 it was defined to be the mass of a
platinum-iridium cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
near Paris. However, this cylinder has lost roughly 50 micrograms since it was created. Because this is the standard,
this has shifted how we defined a kilogram. Therefore, a new definition was adopted in May 2019 based on the
Planck constant and other constants which will never change in value. We will study Planck's constant in quantum
mechanics, which is an area of physics that describes how the smallest pieces of the universe work. The kilogram is
measured on a Kibble balance (see Figure 1.10). When a weight is placed on a Kibble balance, an electrical current
is produced that is proportional to Planck's constant. Since Planck's constant is defined, the exact current
measurements in the balance define the kilogram.

    Metric Prefixes

    SI units are part of the metric system, which is convenient for scientific and engineering calculations because the
    units are categorized by factors of 10. Table 1.2 lists the metric prefixes and symbols used to denote various factors
    of 10 in SI units. For example, a centimeter is one-hundredth of a meter (in symbols, 1 cm = 10-2 m) and a
    kilometer is a thousand meters (1 km = 103 m). Similarly, a megagram is a million grams (1 Mg = 106 g), a
    nanosecond is a billionth of a second (1 ns = 10-9 s), and a terameter is a trillion meters (1 Tm = 1012 m).

measurements in petameters (1 Pm = 1015 m), it is not proper to talk about megagigameters, although

                            In practice, the only time this becomes a bit confusing is when discussing masses. As we have
seen, the base SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg), but metric prefixes need to be applied to the gram (g), because
we are not allowed to "double-up" prefixes. Thus, a thousand kilograms (103 kg) is written as a megagram (1 Mg)
since

Incidentally, 103 kg is also called a metric ton, abbreviated t. This is one of the units outside the SI system
considered acceptable for use with SI units.

As we see in the next section, metric systems have the advantage that conversions of units involve only powers of
10. There are 100 cm in 1 m, 1000 m in 1 km, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as the English system of units,
the relationships are not as simple--there are 12 in. in 1 ft, 5280 ft in 1 mi, and so on.

Another advantage of metric systems is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply
by scaling it with an appropriate metric prefix. The prefix is chosen by the order of magnitude of physical quantities
commonly found in the task at hand. For example, distances in meters are suitable in construction, whereas
distances in kilometers are appropriate for air travel, and nanometers are convenient in optical design. With the
metric system there is no need to invent new units for particular applications. Instead, we rescale the units with
which we are already familiar.

EXAMPLE 1.1

Using Metric Prefixes  using a metric prefix such that the resulting numerical value is bigger than one but

Restate the mass
less than 1000.

Strategy

Since we are not allowed to "double-up" prefixes, we first need to restate the mass in grams by replacing the prefix
symbol k with a factor of 103 (see Table 1.2). Then, we should see which two prefixes in Table 1.2 are closest to the
resulting power of 10 when the number is written in scientific notation. We use whichever of these two prefixes
gives us a number between one and 1000.

Solution
Replacing the k in kilogram with a factor of 103, we find that

From Table 1.2, we see that 1016 is between "peta-" (1015) and "exa-" (1018). If we use the "peta-" prefix, then we

find that                     since                             Alternatively, if we use the "exa-" prefix we find that

                       since                    Because the problem asks for the numerical value

between one and 1000, we use the "peta-" prefix and the answer is 19.3 Pg.

Significance

It is easy to make silly arithmetic errors when switching from one prefix to another, so it is always a good idea to
check that our final answer matches the number we started with. An easy way to do this is to put both numbers in
scientific notation and count powers of 10, including the ones hidden in prefixes. If we did not make a mistake, the

powers of 10 should match up. In this problem, we started with              so we have 13 + 3 = 16 powers of

10. Our final answer in scientific notation is  Pg, so we have 1 + 15 = 16 powers of 10. So, everything
checks out.

If this mass arose from a calculation, we would also want to check to determine whether a mass this large makes
any sense in the context of the problem. For this, Figure 1.4 might be helpful.

    1.3 Unit Conversion

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Use conversion factors to express the value of a given quantity in different units.

    It is often necessary to convert from one unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European cookbook,
    some quantities may be expressed in units of liters and you need to convert them to cups. Or perhaps you are
    reading walking directions from one location to another and you are interested in how many miles you will be
    walking. In this case, you may need to convert units of feet or meters to miles.

    Let's consider a simple example of how to convert units. Suppose we want to convert 80 m to kilometers. The first
    thing to do is to list the units you have and the units to which you want to convert. In this case, we have units in
    meters and we want to convert to kilometers. Next, we need to determine a conversion factor relating meters to
    kilometers. A conversion factor is a ratio that expresses how many of one unit are equal to another unit. For
    example, there are 12 in. in 1 ft, 1609 m in 1 mi, 100 cm in 1 m, 60 s in 1 min, and so on. Refer to Appendix B for a
    more complete list of conversion factors. In this case, we know that there are 1000 m in 1 km. Now we can set up
    our unit conversion. We write the units we have and then multiply them by the conversion factor so the units cancel
    out, as shown:

    Note that the unwanted meter unit cancels, leaving only the desired kilometer unit. You can use this method to
    convert between any type of unit. Now, the conversion of 80 m to kilometers is simply the use of a metric prefix, as
    we saw in the preceding section, so we can get the same answer just as easily by noting that

    since "kilo-" means 103 (see Table 1.2) and  However, using conversion factors is handy when

    converting between units that are not metric or when converting between derived units, as the following examples

    illustrate.

            EXAMPLE 1.2

    Converting Nonmetric Units to Metric

    The distance from the university to home is 10 mi and it usually takes 20 min to drive this distance. Calculate the
    average speed in meters per second (m/s). (Note: Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel.)

    Strategy
    First we calculate the average speed using the given units, then we can get the average speed into the desired units
    by picking the correct conversion factors and multiplying by them. The correct conversion factors are those that
    cancel the unwanted units and leave the desired units in their place. In this case, we want to convert miles to
    meters, so we need to know the fact that there are 1609 m in 1 mi. We also want to convert minutes to seconds, so
    we use the conversion of 60 s in 1 min.

    Solution

      1. Calculate average speed. Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel. (Take this definition as a
            given for now. Average speed and other motion concepts are covered in later chapters.) In equation form,

2. Substitute the given values for distance and time:

3. Convert miles per minute to meters per second by multiplying by the conversion factor that cancels miles and
     leave meters, and also by the conversion factor that cancels minutes and leave seconds:

Significance
Check the answer in the following ways:

  1. Be sure the units in the unit conversion cancel correctly. If the unit conversion factor was written upside down,
        the units do not cancel correctly in the equation. We see the "miles" in the numerator in 0.50 mi/min cancels
        the "mile" in the denominator in the first conversion factor. Also, the "min" in the denominator in 0.50 mi/min
        cancels the "min" in the numerator in the second conversion factor.

  2. Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked us to solve for average speed
        in units of meters per second and, after the cancellations, the only units left are a meter (m) in the numerator
        and a second (s) in the denominator, so we have indeed obtained these units.

Converting between Metric Units

The density of iron is  under standard conditions. Convert this to kg/m3.

Strategy

We need to convert grams to kilograms and cubic centimeters to cubic meters. The conversion factors we need are

          and           However, we are dealing with cubic centimeters                                    so we

have to use the second conversion factor three times (that is, we need to cube it). The idea is still to multiply by the

conversion factors in such a way that they cancel the units we want to get rid of and introduce the units we want to

keep.

Solution

Significance

Remember, it's always important to check the answer.

  1. Be sure to cancel the units in the unit conversion correctly. We see that the gram ("g") in the numerator in 7.86
        g/cm3 cancels the "g" in the denominator in the first conversion factor. Also, the three factors of "cm" in the
        denominator in 7.86 g/cm3 cancel with the three factors of "cm" in the numerator that we get by cubing the
        second conversion factor.

  2. Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked for us to convert to kilograms
        per cubic meter. After the cancellations just described, we see the only units we have left are "kg" in the
        numerator and three factors of "m" in the denominator (that is, one factor of "m" cubed, or "m3"). Therefore,
        the units on the final answer are correct.

    then squaring it and then by converting 1014 m2 directly to square kilometers. You should get the same answer both
    ways.)

    Unit conversions may not seem very interesting, but not doing them can be costly. One famous example of this
    situation was seen with the Mars Climate Orbiter. This probe was launched by NASA on December 11, 1998. On
    September 23, 1999, while attempting to guide the probe into its planned orbit around Mars, NASA lost contact with
    it. Subsequent investigations showed a piece of software called SM_FORCES (or "small forces") was recording
    thruster performance data in the English units of pound-force-seconds (lbf-s). However, other pieces of software
    that used these values for course corrections expected them to be recorded in the SI units of newton-seconds (N-s),
    as dictated in the software interface protocols. This error caused the probe to follow a very different trajectory from
    what NASA thought it was following, which most likely caused the probe either to burn up in the Martian atmosphere
    or to shoot out into space. This failure to pay attention to unit conversions cost hundreds of millions of dollars, not to
    mention all the time invested by the scientists and engineers who worked on the project.

    1.4 Dimensional Analysis

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Find the dimensions of a mathematical expression involving physical quantities.
        · Determine whether an equation involving physical quantities is dimensionally consistent.

    The dimension of any physical quantity expresses its dependence on the base quantities as a product of symbols

    (or powers of symbols) representing the base quantities. Table 1.3 lists the base quantities and the symbols used
    for their dimension. For example, a measurement of length is said to have dimension L or L1, a measurement of
    mass has dimension M or M1, and a measurement of time has dimension T or T1. Like units, dimensions obey the
    rules of algebra. Thus, area is the product of two lengths and so has dimension L2, or length squared. Similarly,
    volume is the product of three lengths and has dimension L3, or length cubed. Speed has dimension length over
    time, L/T or LT-1. Volumetric mass density has dimension M/L3 or ML-3, or mass over length cubed. In general, the

    dimension of any physical quantity can be written as                             for some powers  and g. We

    can write the dimensions of a length in this form with  and the remaining six powers all set equal to zero:

                               Any quantity with a dimension that can be written so that all seven powers are zero (that

    is, its dimension is                      ) is called dimensionless (or sometimes "of dimension 1," because anything

    raised to the zero power is one). Physicists often call dimensionless quantities pure numbers.

TABLE 1.3 Base Quantities and Their Dimensions

Physicists often use square brackets around the symbol for a physical quantity to represent the dimensions of that

quantity. For example, if is the radius of a cylinder and is its height, then we write  and  to indicate

the dimensions of the radius and height are both those of length, or L. Similarly, if we use the symbol for the
surface area of a cylinder and for its volume, then [A] = L2 and [V] = L3. If we use the symbol for the mass of the

cylinder and for the density of the material from which the cylinder is made, then      and

The importance of the concept of dimension arises from the fact that any mathematical equation relating physical
quantities must be dimensionally consistent, which means the equation must obey the following rules:

· Every term in an expression must have the same dimensions; it does not make sense to add or subtract
   quantities of differing dimension (think of the old saying: "You can't add apples and oranges"). In particular,
   the expressions on each side of the equality in an equation must have the same dimensions.

· The arguments of any of the standard mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions (such as sine
   and cosine), logarithms, or exponential functions that appear in the equation must be dimensionless. These
   functions require pure numbers as inputs and give pure numbers as outputs.

If either of these rules is violated, an equation is not dimensionally consistent and cannot possibly be a correct
statement of physical law. This simple fact can be used to check for typos or algebra mistakes, to help remember
the various laws of physics, and even to suggest the form that new laws of physics might take. This last use of
dimensions is beyond the scope of this text, but is something you may learn later in your academic career.

        EXAMPLE 1.4

Using Dimensions to Remember an Equation

Suppose we need the formula for the area of a circle for some computation. Like many people who learned
geometry too long ago to recall with any certainty, two expressions may pop into our mind when we think of circles:

     and One expression is the circumference of a circle of radius r and the other is its area. But which is which?

Strategy
One natural strategy is to look it up, but this could take time to find information from a reputable source. Besides,
even if we think the source is reputable, we shouldn't trust everything we read. It is nice to have a way to double-
check just by thinking about it. Also, we might be in a situation in which we cannot look things up (such as during a
test). Thus, the strategy is to find the dimensions of both expressions by making use of the fact that dimensions
follow the rules of algebra. If either expression does not have the same dimensions as area, then it cannot possibly
be the correct equation for the area of a circle.

Solution
We know the dimension of area is L2. Now, the dimension of the expression is

since the constant is a pure number and the radius is a length. Therefore,  has the dimension of area.
Similarly, the dimension of the expression is

since the constants and are both dimensionless and the radius is a length. We see that has the dimension
22  1 · Units and Measurement

    of length, which means it cannot possibly be an area.

    We rule out because it is not dimensionally consistent with being an area. We see that is dimensionally
    consistent with being an area, so if we have to choose between these two expressions, is the one to choose.

    Significance

    This may seem like kind of a silly example, but the ideas are very general. As long as we know the dimensions of the
    individual physical quantities that appear in an equation, we can check to see whether the equation is dimensionally
    consistent. On the other hand, knowing that true equations are dimensionally consistent, we can match expressions
    from our imperfect memories to the quantities for which they might be expressions. Doing this will not help us
    remember dimensionless factors that appear in the equations (for example, if you had accidentally conflated the

    two expressions from the example into  then dimensional analysis is no help), but it does help us remember
    the correct basic form of equations.

    EXAMPLE 1.5

    Checking Equations for Dimensional Consistency

    Consider the physical quantities       and with dimensions                          and
                                                                                           (b)
    Determine whether each of the following equations is dimensionally consistent: (a)

                  and (c)

    Strategy

    By the definition of dimensional consistency, we need to check that each term in a given equation has the same
    dimensions as the other terms in that equation and that the arguments of any standard mathematical functions are
    dimensionless.

    Solution

    a. There are no trigonometric, logarithmic, or exponential functions to worry about in this equation, so we need
         only look at the dimensions of each term appearing in the equation. There are three terms, one in the left
         expression and two in the expression on the right, so we look at each in turn:

         All three terms have the same dimension, so this equation is dimensionally consistent.
    b. Again, there are no trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic functions, so we only need to look at the

         dimensions of each of the three terms appearing in the equation:

            None of the three terms has the same dimension as any other, so this is about as far from being dimensionally
           consistent as you can get. The technical term for an equation like this is nonsense.
       c. This equation has a trigonometric function in it, so first we should check that the argument of the sine function
            is dimensionless:

        The argument is dimensionless. So far, so good. Now we need to check the dimensions of each of the two
        terms (that is, the left expression and the right expression) in the equation:

The two terms have different dimensions--meaning, the equation is not dimensionally consistent. This equation is
another example of "nonsense."
Significance
If we are trusting people, these types of dimensional checks might seem unnecessary. But, rest assured, any
textbook on a quantitative subject such as physics (including this one) almost certainly contains some equations
with typos. Checking equations routinely by dimensional analysis save us the embarrassment of using an incorrect
equation. Also, checking the dimensions of an equation we obtain through algebraic manipulation is a great way to
make sure we did not make a mistake (or to spot a mistake, if we made one).

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 1.6

Is the equation v = at dimensionally consistent?

One further point that needs to be mentioned is the effect of the operations of calculus on dimensions. We have
seen that dimensions obey the rules of algebra, just like units, but what happens when we take the derivative of one
physical quantity with respect to another or integrate a physical quantity over another? The derivative of a function
is just the slope of the line tangent to its graph and slopes are ratios, so for physical quantities v and t, we have that
the dimension of the derivative of v with respect to t is just the ratio of the dimension of v over that of t:

Similarly, since integrals are just sums of products, the dimension of the integral of v with respect to t is simply the
dimension of v times the dimension of t:

By the same reasoning, analogous rules hold for the units of physical quantities derived from other quantities by
integration or differentiation.

1.5 Estimates and Fermi Calculations

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Estimate the values of physical quantities.
On many occasions, physicists, other scientists, and engineers need to make estimates for a particular quantity.
Other terms sometimes used are guesstimates, order-of-magnitude approximations, back-of-the-envelope
calculations, or Fermi calculations. (The physicist Enrico Fermi mentioned earlier was famous for his ability to
estimate various kinds of data with surprising precision.) Will that piece of equipment fit in the back of the car or do
we need to rent a truck? How long will this download take? About how large a current will there be in this circuit
when it is turned on? How many houses could a proposed power plant actually power if it is built? Note that
estimating does not mean guessing a number or a formula at random. Rather, estimation means using prior
experience and sound physical reasoning to arrive at a rough idea of a quantity's value. Because the process of
determining a reliable approximation usually involves the identification of correct physical principles and a good
24  1 · Units and Measurement

    guess about the relevant variables, estimating is very useful in developing physical intuition. Estimates also allow us
    to perform "sanity checks" on calculations or policy proposals by helping us rule out certain scenarios or unrealistic
    numbers. They allow us to challenge others (as well as ourselves) in our efforts to learn truths about the world.

    Many estimates are based on formulas in which the input quantities are known only to a limited precision. As you
    develop physics problem-solving skills (which are applicable to a wide variety of fields), you also will develop skills
    at estimating. You develop these skills by thinking quantitatively and being willing to take risks. As with any skill,
    experience helps. Familiarity with dimensions (see Table 1.3) and units (see Table 1.1 and Table 1.2), and the scales
    of base quantities (see Figure 1.4) also helps.

    To make some progress in estimating, you need to have some definite ideas about how variables may be related.
    The following strategies may help you in practicing the art of estimation:

        · Get big lengths from smaller lengths. When estimating lengths, remember that anything can be a ruler. Thus,
            imagine breaking a big thing into smaller things, estimate the length of one of the smaller things, and multiply
            to get the length of the big thing. For example, to estimate the height of a building, first count how many floors
            it has. Then, estimate how big a single floor is by imagining how many people would have to stand on each
            other's shoulders to reach the ceiling. Last, estimate the height of a person. The product of these three
            estimates is your estimate of the height of the building. It helps to have memorized a few length scales
            relevant to the sorts of problems you find yourself solving. For example, knowing some of the length scales in
            Figure 1.4 might come in handy. Sometimes it also helps to do this in reverse--that is, to estimate the length of
            a small thing, imagine a bunch of them making up a bigger thing. For example, to estimate the thickness of a
            sheet of paper, estimate the thickness of a stack of paper and then divide by the number of pages in the stack.
            These same strategies of breaking big things into smaller things or aggregating smaller things into a bigger
            thing can sometimes be used to estimate other physical quantities, such as masses and times.

        · Get areas and volumes from lengths. When dealing with an area or a volume of a complex object, introduce a
            simple model of the object such as a sphere or a box. Then, estimate the linear dimensions (such as the radius
            of the sphere or the length, width, and height of the box) first, and use your estimates to obtain the volume or
            area from standard geometric formulas. If you happen to have an estimate of an object's area or volume, you
            can also do the reverse; that is, use standard geometric formulas to get an estimate of its linear dimensions.

        · Get masses from volumes and densities. When estimating masses of objects, it can help first to estimate its
            volume and then to estimate its mass from a rough estimate of its average density (recall, density has
            dimension mass over length cubed, so mass is density times volume). For this, it helps to remember that the
            density of air is around 1 kg/m3, the density of water is 103 kg/m3, and the densest everyday solids max out at
            around 104 kg/m3. Asking yourself whether an object floats or sinks in either air or water gets you a ballpark
            estimate of its density. You can also do this the other way around; if you have an estimate of an object's mass
            and its density, you can use them to get an estimate of its volume.

        · If all else fails, bound it. For physical quantities for which you do not have a lot of intuition, sometimes the
            best you can do is think something like: Well, it must be bigger than this and smaller than that. For example,
            suppose you need to estimate the mass of a moose. Maybe you have a lot of experience with moose and know
            their average mass offhand. If so, great. But for most people, the best they can do is to think something like: It
            must be bigger than a person (of order 102 kg) and less than a car (of order 103 kg). If you need a single
            number for a subsequent calculation, you can take the geometric mean of the upper and lower bound--that is,
            you multiply them together and then take the square root. For the moose mass example, this would be

       The tighter the bounds, the better. Also, no rules are unbreakable when it comes to estimation. If you think the
       value of the quantity is likely to be closer to the upper bound than the lower bound, then you may want to
       bump up your estimate from the geometric mean by an order or two of magnitude.
    · One "sig. fig." is fine. There is no need to go beyond one significant figure, or one digit in the coefficient of an
       expression in scientific notation, when doing calculations to obtain an estimate. In most cases, the order of
       magnitude is good enough. The goal is just to get in the ballpark figure, so keep the arithmetic as simple as
       possible.
    · Ask yourself: Does this make any sense? Last, check to see whether your answer is reasonable. How does it
       compare with the values of other quantities with the same dimensions that you already know or can look up

easily? If you get some wacky answer (for example, if you estimate the mass of the Atlantic Ocean to be bigger
than the mass of Earth, or some time span to be longer than the age of the universe), first check to see
whether your units are correct. Then, check for arithmetic errors. Then, rethink the logic you used to arrive at
your answer. If everything checks out, you may have just proved that some slick new idea is actually bogus.

EXAMPLE 1.6

Mass of Earth's Oceans

Estimate the total mass of the oceans on Earth.

Strategy

We know the density of water is about 103 kg/m3, so we start with the advice to "get masses from densities and

volumes." Thus, we need to estimate the volume of the planet's oceans. Using the advice to "get areas and volumes

from lengths," we can estimate the volume of the oceans as surface area times average depth, or V = AD. We know

the diameter of Earth from Figure 1.4 and we know that most of Earth's surface is covered in water, so we can

estimate the surface area of the oceans as being roughly equal to the surface area of the planet. By following the

advice to "get areas and volumes from lengths" again, we can approximate Earth as a sphere and use the formula

for the surface area of a sphere of diameter d--that is,                 to estimate the surface area of the oceans. Now we

just need to estimate the average depth of the oceans. For this, we use the advice: "If all else fails, bound it." We

happen to know the deepest points in the ocean are around 10 km and that it is not uncommon for the ocean to be

deeper than 1 km, so we take the average depth to be around                                   Now we just need to
put it all together, heeding the advice that "one `sig. fig.' is fine."

Solution
We estimate the surface area of Earth (and hence the surface area of Earth's oceans) to be roughly

Next, using our average depth estimate of                 which was obtained by bounding, we estimate the
volume of Earth's oceans to be

Last, we estimate the mass of the world's oceans to be

Thus, we estimate that the order of magnitude of the mass of the planet's oceans is 1021 kg.

Significance

To verify our answer to the best of our ability, we first need to answer the question: Does this make any sense? From
Figure 1.4, we see the mass of Earth's atmosphere is on the order of 1019 kg and the mass of Earth is on the order of
1025 kg. It is reassuring that our estimate of 1021 kg for the mass of Earth's oceans falls somewhere between these

two. So, yes, it does seem to make sense. It just so happens that we did a search on the Web for "mass of oceans"

and the top search results all said              which is the same order of magnitude as our estimate. Now,

rather than having to trust blindly whoever first put that number up on a website (most of the other sites probably

just copied it from them, after all), we can have a little more confidence in it.

    1.6 Significant Figures

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Determine the correct number of significant figures for the result of a computation.
        · Describe the relationship between the concepts of accuracy, precision, uncertainty, and discrepancy.
        · Calculate the percent uncertainty of a measurement, given its value and its uncertainty.
        · Determine the uncertainty of the result of a computation involving quantities with given uncertainties.

    Figure 1.11 shows two instruments used to measure the mass of an object. The digital scale has mostly replaced
    the double-pan balance in physics labs because it gives more accurate and precise measurements. But what exactly
    do we mean by accurate and precise? Aren't they the same thing? In this section we examine in detail the process of
    making and reporting a measurement.

    FIGURE 1.11 (a) A double-pan mechanical balance is used to compare different masses. Usually an object with unknown mass is placed in
    one pan and objects of known mass are placed in the other pan. When the bar that connects the two pans is horizontal, then the masses in
    both pans are equal. The "known masses" are typically metal cylinders of standard mass such as 1 g, 10 g, and 100 g. (b) Many mechanical
    balances, such as double-pan balances, have been replaced by digital scales, which can typically measure the mass of an object more
    precisely. A mechanical balance may read only the mass of an object to the nearest tenth of a gram, but many digital scales can measure
    the mass of an object up to the nearest thousandth of a gram. (credit a: modification of work by Serge Melki; credit b: modification of work

    Accuracy and Precision of a Measurement

    Science is based on observation and experiment--that is, on measurements. Accuracy is how close a measurement
    is to the accepted reference value for that measurement. For example, let's say we want to measure the length of
    standard printer paper. The packaging in which we purchased the paper states that it is 11.0 in. long. We then
    measure the length of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9 in.
    These measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the reference value of 11.0 in. In contrast, if
    we had obtained a measurement of 12 in., our measurement would not be very accurate. Notice that the concept of
    accuracy requires that an accepted reference value be given.

    Access for free at openstax.org
1.6 · Significant Figures                                                                                                                          27

The precision of measurements refers to how close the agreement is between repeated independent
measurements (which are repeated under the same conditions). Consider the example of the paper measurements.
The precision of the measurements refers to the spread of the measured values. One way to analyze the precision of
the measurements is to determine the range, or difference, between the lowest and the highest measured values. In
this case, the lowest value was 10.9 in. and the highest value was 11.2 in. Thus, the measured values deviated from
each other by, at most, 0.3 in. These measurements were relatively precise because they did not vary too much in
value. However, if the measured values had been 10.9 in., 11.1 in., and 11.9 in., then the measurements would not
be very precise because there would be significant variation from one measurement to another. Notice that the
concept of precision depends only on the actual measurements acquired and does not depend on an accepted
reference value.

The measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are
accurate but not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let's consider an example of a GPS attempting to
locate the position of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull's-eye
target and think of each GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot. In Figure 1.12(a), we see the GPS
measurements are spread out far apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the actual location of the
restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low-precision, high-accuracy measuring system. However, in
Figure 1.12(b), the GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the
target location. This indicates a high-precision, low-accuracy measuring system.

FIGURE 1.12 A GPS attempts to locate a restaurant at the center of the bull's-eye. The black dots represent each attempt to pinpoint the
location of the restaurant. (a) The dots are spread out quite far apart from one another, indicating low precision, but they are each rather
close to the actual location of the restaurant, indicating high accuracy. (b) The dots are concentrated rather closely to one another,
indicating high precision, but they are rather far away from the actual location of the restaurant, indicating low accuracy. (credit a and credit

Accuracy, Precision, Uncertainty, and Discrepancy

The precision of a measuring system is related to the uncertainty in the measurements whereas the accuracy is
related to the discrepancy from the accepted reference value. Uncertainty is a quantitative measure of how much
your measured values deviate from one another. There are many different methods of calculating uncertainty, each
of which is appropriate to different situations. Some examples include taking the range (that is, the largest minus
the smallest) or finding the standard deviation of the measurements. Discrepancy (or "measurement error") is the
difference between the measured value and a given standard or expected value. If the measurements are not very
precise, then the uncertainty of the values is high. If the measurements are not very accurate, then the discrepancy
of the values is high.

Recall our example of measuring paper length; we obtained measurements of 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9 in., and the
accepted value was 11.0 in. We might average the three measurements to say our best guess is 11.1 in.; in this
case, our discrepancy is 11.1 - 11.0 = 0.1 in., which provides a quantitative measure of accuracy. We might
calculate the uncertainty in our best guess by using half of the range of our measured values: 0.15 in. Then we
would say the length of the paper is 11.1 in. plus or minus 0.15 in. The uncertainty in a measurement, A, is often
denoted as A (read "delta A"), so the measurement result would be recorded as A ± A. Returning to our paper
example, the measured length of the paper could be expressed as 11.1 ± 0.15 in. Since the discrepancy of 0.1 in. is
less than the uncertainty of 0.15 in., we might say the measured value agrees with the accepted reference value to
28  1 · Units and Measurement

    within experimental uncertainty.

    Some factors that contribute to uncertainty in a measurement include the following:

        · Limitations of the measuring device
        · The skill of the person taking the measurement
        · Irregularities in the object being measured
        · Any other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation)

    In our example, such factors contributing to the uncertainty could be the smallest division on the ruler is 1/16 in.,
    the person using the ruler has bad eyesight, the ruler is worn down on one end, or one side of the paper is slightly
    longer than the other. At any rate, the uncertainty in a measurement must be calculated to quantify its precision. If a
    reference value is known, it makes sense to calculate the discrepancy as well to quantify its accuracy.

    Percent uncertainty
    Another method of expressing uncertainty is as a percent of the measured value. If a measurement A is expressed
    with uncertainty A, the percent uncertainty is defined as

    EXAMPLE 1.7

    Calculating Percent Uncertainty: A Bag of Apples

    A grocery store sells 5-lb bags of apples. Let's say we purchase four bags during the course of a month and weigh
    the bags each time. We obtain the following measurements:

    · Week 1 weight: 4.8 lb
    · Week 2 weight: 5.3 lb
    · Week 3 weight: 4.9 lb
    · Week 4 weight: 5.4 lb

    We then determine the average weight of the 5-lb bag of apples is 5.1 ± 0.3 lb from using half of the range. What is
    the percent uncertainty of the bag's weight?

    Strategy                                                                                                 is 0.3 lb. We
    First, observe that the average value of the bag's weight, A, is 5.1 lb. The uncertainty in this value,
    can use the following equation to determine the percent uncertainty of the weight:

                                                                                                             1.1

    Solution
    Substitute the values into the equation:

    Significance

    We can conclude the average weight of a bag of apples from this store is 5.1 lb ± 6%. Notice the percent uncertainty

    is dimensionless because the units of weight in  lb canceled those in A = 5.1 lb when we took the ratio.

s. Will the coach's new stopwatch be helpful in timing the sprint team? Why or why not?

Uncertainties in calculations

Uncertainty exists in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated from

measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the length and width have uncertainties. How big

is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements going into the

calculation have small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the method of adding percents can be used for

multiplication or division. This method states the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or

division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation. For example, if a floor has

a length of 4.00 m and a width of 3.00 m, with uncertainties of 2% and 1%, respectively, then the area of the floor is

12.0 m2 and has an uncertainty of 3%. (Expressed as an area, this is 0.36 m2 [      ], which we round to

0.4 m2 since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a square meter.)

Precision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures

An important factor in the precision of measurements involves the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a
precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, a standard ruler can
measure length to the nearest millimeter whereas a caliper can measure length to the nearest 0.01 mm. The caliper
is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences in length. The more precise
the measuring tool, the more precise the measurements.

When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we measured initially with our measuring tool.
For example, if we use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, we may measure it to be 36.7 cm. We can't
express this value as 36.71 cm because our measuring tool is not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a
centimeter. It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person
performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices the stick
length seems to be somewhere in between 36.6 cm and 36.7 cm, and he or she must estimate the value of the last
digit. Using the method of significant figures, the rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the
first digit with some uncertainty. To determine the number of significant digits in a value, start with the first
measured value at the left and count the number of digits through the last digit written on the right. For example, the
measured value 36.7 cm has three digits, or three significant figures. Significant figures indicate the precision of the
measuring tool used to measure a value.

Zeros

Special consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. The zeros in 0.053 are not significant

because they are placeholders that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053. The zeros in

10.053 are not placeholders; they are significant. This number has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or

may not be significant, depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the last

digit or they could be placeholders. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. To avoid this

ambiguity, we should write 1300 in scientific notation as                       or  depending on

whether it has two, three, or four significant figures. Zeros are significant except when they serve only as

placeholders.

Significant figures in calculations
When combining measurements with different degrees of precision with the mathematical operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, or division, then the number of significant digits in the final answer can be no greater
than the number of significant digits in the least-precise measured value. There are two different rules, one for
multiplication and division and the other for addition and subtraction.

1. For multiplication and division, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the quantity

     with the least number of significant figures entering into the calculation. For example, the area of a circle can
     be calculated from its radius using A = r2. Let's see how many significant figures the area has if the radius has

     only two--say, r = 1.2 m. Using a calculator with an eight-digit output, we would calculate
30  1 · Units and Measurement

            But because the radius has only two significant figures, it limits the calculated quantity to two significant
            figures, or

           although  is good to at least eight digits.
      2. For addition and subtraction, the answer can contain no more decimal places than the least-precise

           measurement. Suppose we buy 7.56 kg of potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale with precision
            0.01 kg, then we drop off 6.052 kg of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with precision 0.001
            kg. Then, we go home and add 13.7 kg of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with precision 0.1 kg.
            How many kilograms of potatoes do we now have and how many significant figures are appropriate in the
            answer? The mass is found by simple addition and subtraction:

            Next, we identify the least-precise measurement: 13.7 kg. This measurement is expressed to the 0.1 decimal
            place, so our final answer must also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus, the answer is rounded to the
            tenths place, giving us 15.2 kg.

    Significant figures in this text
    In this text, most numbers are assumed to have three significant figures. Furthermore, consistent numbers of
    significant figures are used in all worked examples. An answer given to three digits is based on input good to at least
    three digits, for example. If the input has fewer significant figures, the answer will also have fewer significant figures.
    Care is also taken that the number of significant figures is reasonable for the situation posed. In some topics,
    particularly in optics, more accurate numbers are needed and we use more than three significant figures. Finally, if a
    number is exact, such as the two in the formula for the circumference of a circle, C = 2r, it does not affect the
    number of significant figures in a calculation. Likewise, conversion factors such as 100 cm/1 m are considered exact
    and do not affect the number of significant figures in a calculation.

to apply broad physical principles--usually represented by equations--to specific situations is a very powerful form
of knowledge. It is much more powerful than memorizing a list of facts. Analytical skills and problem-solving
abilities can be applied to new situations whereas a list of facts cannot be made long enough to contain every
possible circumstance. Such analytical skills are useful both for solving problems in this text and for applying
physics in everyday life.

As you are probably well aware, a certain amount of creativity and insight is required to solve problems. No rigid
procedure works every time. Creativity and insight grow with experience. With practice, the basics of problem
solving become almost automatic. One way to get practice is to work out the text's examples for yourself as you
read. Another is to work as many end-of-section problems as possible, starting with the easiest to build confidence
and then progressing to the more difficult. After you become involved in physics, you will see it all around you, and
you can begin to apply it to situations you encounter outside the classroom, just as is done in many of the
applications in this text.

Although there is no simple step-by-step method that works for every problem, the following three-stage process
facilitates problem solving and makes it more meaningful. The three stages are strategy, solution, and significance.
This process is used in examples throughout the book. Here, we look at each stage of the process in turn.

Strategy

Strategy is the beginning stage of solving a problem. The idea is to figure out exactly what the problem is and then
develop a strategy for solving it. Some general advice for this stage is as follows:

    · Examine the situation to determine which physical principles are involved. It often helps to draw a simple
       sketch at the outset. You often need to decide which direction is positive and note that on your sketch. When
        you have identified the physical principles, it is much easier to find and apply the equations representing those
        principles. Although finding the correct equation is essential, keep in mind that equations represent physical
        principles, laws of nature, and relationships among physical quantities. Without a conceptual understanding of
        a problem, a numerical solution is meaningless.

    · Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the "knowns"). Many
        problems are stated very succinctly and require some inspection to determine what is known. Drawing a
        sketch can be very useful at this point as well. Formally identifying the knowns is of particular importance in
       applying physics to real-world situations. For example, the word stopped means the velocity is zero at that
        instant. Also, we can often take initial time and position as zero by the appropriate choice of coordinate
        system.

    · Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). In complex problems,
        especially, it is not always obvious what needs to be found or in what sequence. Making a list can help identify
        the unknowns.

    · Determine which physical principles can help you solve the problem. Since physical principles tend to be
        expressed in the form of mathematical equations, a list of knowns and unknowns can help here. It is easiest if
        you can find equations that contain only one unknown--that is, all the other variables are known--so you can
        solve for the unknown easily. If the equation contains more than one unknown, then additional equations are
        needed to solve the problem. In some problems, several unknowns must be determined to get at the one
        needed most. In such problems it is especially important to keep physical principles in mind to avoid going
        astray in a sea of equations. You may have to use two (or more) different equations to get the final answer.

Solution

The solution stage is when you do the math. Substitute the knowns (along with their units) into the appropriate
equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. That is, do the algebra, calculus, geometry, or
arithmetic necessary to find the unknown from the knowns, being sure to carry the units through the calculations.
This step is clearly important because it produces the numerical answer, along with its units. Notice, however, that
this stage is only one-third of the overall problem-solving process.

Significance

After having done the math in the solution stage of problem solving, it is tempting to think you are done. But, always
remember that physics is not math. Rather, in doing physics, we use mathematics as a tool to help us understand
32  1 · Units and Measurement

    nature. So, after you obtain a numerical answer, you should always assess its significance:

        · Check your units. If the units of the answer are incorrect, then an error has been made and you should go back
            over your previous steps to find it. One way to find the mistake is to check all the equations you derived for
            dimensional consistency. However, be warned that correct units do not guarantee the numerical part of the
            answer is also correct.

        · Check the answer to see whether it is reasonable. Does it make sense? This step is extremely important: -the
            goal of physics is to describe nature accurately. To determine whether the answer is reasonable, check both
            its magnitude and its sign, in addition to its units. The magnitude should be consistent with a rough estimate
            of what it should be. It should also compare reasonably with magnitudes of other quantities of the same type.
            The sign usually tells you about direction and should be consistent with your prior expectations. Your
            judgment will improve as you solve more physics problems, and it will become possible for you to make finer
            judgments regarding whether nature is described adequately by the answer to a problem. This step brings the
            problem back to its conceptual meaning. If you can judge whether the answer is reasonable, you have a
            deeper understanding of physics than just being able to solve a problem mechanically.

        · Check to see whether the answer tells you something interesting. What does it mean? This is the flip side of
            the question: Does it make sense? Ultimately, physics is about understanding nature, and we solve physics
            problems to learn a little something about how nature operates. Therefore, assuming the answer does make
            sense, you should always take a moment to see if it tells you something about the world that you find
            interesting. Even if the answer to this particular problem is not very interesting to you, what about the method
            you used to solve it? Could the method be adapted to answer a question that you do find interesting? In many
            ways, it is in answering questions such as these that science progresses.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
2.1 Scalars and Vectors
2.2 Coordinate Systems and Components of a Vector
2.3 Algebra of Vectors
2.4 Products of Vectors
INTRODUCTION Vectors are essential to physics and engineering. Many fundamental physical quantities are
vectors, including displacement, velocity, force, and electric and magnetic vector fields. Scalar products of vectors
define other fundamental scalar physical quantities, such as energy. Vector products of vectors define still other
fundamental vector physical quantities, such as torque and angular momentum. In other words, vectors are a
component part of physics in much the same way as sentences are a component part of literature.
In introductory physics, vectors are Euclidean quantities that have geometric representations as arrows in one
dimension (in a line), in two dimensions (in a plane), or in three dimensions (in space). They can be added,
subtracted, or multiplied. In this chapter, we explore elements of vector algebra for applications in mechanics and in
electricity and magnetism. Vector operations also have numerous generalizations in other branches of physics.

    2.1 Scalars and Vectors

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Describe the difference between vector and scalar quantities.
        · Identify the magnitude and direction of a vector.
        · Explain the effect of multiplying a vector quantity by a scalar.
        · Describe how one-dimensional vector quantities are added or subtracted.
        · Explain the geometric construction for the addition or subtraction of vectors in a plane.
        · Distinguish between a vector equation and a scalar equation.

    Many familiar physical quantities can be specified completely by giving a single number and the appropriate unit.
    For example, "a class period lasts 50 min" or "the gas tank in my car holds 65 L" or "the distance between two posts
    is 100 m." A physical quantity that can be specified completely in this manner is called a scalar quantity. Scalar is a
    synonym of "number." Time, mass, distance, length, volume, temperature, and energy are examples of scalar
    quantities.

    Scalar quantities that have the same physical units can be added or subtracted according to the usual rules of

    algebra for numbers. For example, a class ending 10 min earlier than 50 min lasts                               .

    Similarly, a 60-cal serving of corn followed by a 200-cal serving of donuts gives                of

    energy. When we multiply a scalar quantity by a number, we obtain the same scalar quantity but with a larger (or

    smaller) value. For example, if yesterday's breakfast had 200 cal of energy and today's breakfast has four times as

    much energy as it had yesterday, then today's breakfast has                        of energy. Two scalar quantities

    can also be multiplied or divided by each other to form a derived scalar quantity. For example, if a train covers a

    distance of 100 km in 1.0 h, its speed is 100.0 km/1.0 h = 27.8 m/s, where the speed is a derived scalar quantity

    obtained by dividing distance by time.

    Many physical quantities, however, cannot be described completely by just a single number of physical units. For
    example, when the U.S. Coast Guard dispatches a ship or a helicopter for a rescue mission, the rescue team must
    know not only the distance to the distress signal, but also the direction from which the signal is coming so they can
    get to its origin as quickly as possible. Physical quantities specified completely by giving a number of units
    (magnitude) and a direction are called vector quantities. Examples of vector quantities include displacement,
    velocity, position, force, and torque. In the language of mathematics, physical vector quantities are represented by
    mathematical objects called vectors (Figure 2.2). We can add or subtract two vectors, and we can multiply a vector
    by a scalar or by another vector, but we cannot divide by a vector. The operation of division by a vector is not
    defined.

    FIGURE 2.2 We draw a vector from the initial point or origin (called the "tail" of a vector) to the end or terminal point (called the "head" of a
    vector), marked by an arrowhead. Magnitude is the length of a vector and is always a positive scalar quantity. (credit "photo": modification
    of work by Cate Sevilla)

    Let's examine vector algebra using a graphical method to be aware of basic terms and to develop a qualitative
    understanding. In practice, however, when it comes to solving physics problems, we use analytical methods, which
    we'll see in the next section. Analytical methods are more simple computationally and more accurate than graphical
    methods. From now on, to distinguish between a vector and a scalar quantity, we adopt the common convention
    that a letter in bold type with an arrow above it denotes a vector, and a letter without an arrow denotes a scalar. For
    example, a distance of 2.0 km, which is a scalar quantity, is denoted by d = 2.0 km, whereas a displacement of 2.0

km in some direction, which is a vector quantity, is denoted by .

Suppose you tell a friend on a camping trip that you have discovered a terrific fishing hole 6 km from your tent. It is
unlikely your friend would be able to find the hole easily unless you also communicate the direction in which it can
be found with respect to your campsite. You may say, for example, "Walk about 6 km northeast from my tent." The
key concept here is that you have to give not one but two pieces of information--namely, the distance or magnitude
(6 km) and the direction (northeast).

Displacement is a general term used to describe a change in position, such as during a trip from the tent to the
fishing hole. Displacement is an example of a vector quantity. If you walk from the tent (location A) to the hole

(location B), as shown in Figure 2.3, the vector , representing your displacement, is drawn as the arrow that
originates at point A and ends at point B. The arrowhead marks the end of the vector. The direction of the

displacement vector is the direction of the arrow. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude D of vector

  . Here, D = 6 km. Since the magnitude of a vector is its length, which is a positive number, the magnitude is also
indicated by placing the absolute value notation around the symbol that denotes the vector; so, we can write

equivalently that  . To solve a vector problem graphically, we need to draw the vector to scale. For

example, if we assume 1 unit of distance (1 km) is represented in the drawing by a line segment of length u = 2 cm,

then the total displacement in this example is represented by a vector of length                      , as

shown in Figure 2.4. Notice that here, to avoid confusion, we used        to denote the magnitude of the actual

displacement and d = 12 cm to denote the length of its representation in the drawing.

FIGURE 2.3 The displacement vector from point A (the initial position at the campsite) to point B (the final position at the fishing hole) is
indicated by an arrow with origin at point A and end at point B. The displacement is the same for any of the actual paths (dashed curves)
that may be taken between points A and B.

FIGURE 2.4 A displacement of magnitude 6 km is drawn to scale as a vector of length 12 cm when the length of 2 cm represents 1 unit of
displacement (which in this case is 1 km).

Suppose your friend walks from the campsite at A to the fishing pond at B and then walks back: from the fishing

pond at B to the campsite at A. The magnitude of the displacement vector          from A to B is the same as the

magnitude of the displacement vector  from B to A (it equals 6 km in both cases), so we can write
44  2 · Vectors

                 . However, vector         is not equal to vector     because these two vectors have different

    directions:  . In Figure 2.3, vector            would be represented by a vector with an origin at point B and

    an end at point A, indicating vector   points to the southwest, which is exactly   opposite to the direction of

    vector       . We say that vector      is antiparallel to vector        and write  , where the minus sign

    indicates the antiparallel direction.

    Two vectors that have identical directions are said to be parallel vectors--meaning, they are parallel to each other.

    Two parallel vectors and are equal, denoted by                 , if and only if they have equal magnitudes                      . Two

    vectors are illustrated in Figure 2.5.

    Algebra of Vectors in One Dimension

    Vectors can be multiplied by scalars, added to other vectors, or subtracted from other vectors. We can illustrate
    these vector concepts using an example of the fishing trip seen in Figure 2.6.

FIGURE 2.6 Displacement vectors for a fishing trip. (a) Stopping to rest at point C while walking from camp (point A) to the pond (point B).
(b) Going back for the dropped tackle box (point D). (c) Finishing up at the fishing pond.

Suppose your friend departs from point A (the campsite) and walks in the direction to point B (the fishing pond), but,
along the way, stops to rest at some point C located three-quarters of the distance between A and B, beginning from

point A (Figure 2.6(a)). What is his displacement vector       when he reaches point C? We know that if he walks all

the way to B, his displacement vector relative to A is      , which has magnitude            and a direction of

northeast. If he walks only a 0.75 fraction of the total distance, maintaining the northeasterly direction, at point C he

must be                    away from the campsite at A. So, his displacement vector at the rest point C has

magnitude                                 and is parallel to the displacement vector   . All of this can be stated

succinctly in the form of the following vector equation:

In a vector equation, both sides of the equation are vectors. The previous equation is an example of a vector

multiplied by a positive scalar (number)  . The result,        , of such a multiplication is a new vector with a

direction parallel to the direction of the original vector  .

In general, when a vector  is multiplied by a positive scalar , the result is a new vector  that is parallel to :
                                                                                                                       2.1

The magnitude of this new vector is obtained by multiplying the magnitude of the original vector, as
expressed by the scalar equation:

                                                                                                                                                       2.2

In a scalar equation, both sides of the equation are numbers. Equation 2.2 is a scalar equation because the
magnitudes of vectors are scalar quantities (and positive numbers). If the scalar is negative in the vector equation
Equation 2.1, then the magnitude of the new vector is still given by Equation 2.2, but the direction of the new

vector is antiparallel to the direction of . These principles are illustrated in Figure 2.7(a) by two examples where

the length of vector is 1.5 units. When   , the new vector                 has length                          (twice as

long as the original vector) and is parallel to the original vector. When  , the new vector                    has length

                           (twice as long as the original vector) and is antiparallel to the original vector.

    Now suppose your fishing buddy departs from point A (the campsite), walking in the direction to point B (the fishing
    hole), but he realizes he lost his tackle box when he stopped to rest at point C (located three-quarters of the
    distance between A and B, beginning from point A). So, he turns back and retraces his steps in the direction toward
    the campsite and finds the box lying on the path at some point D only 1.2 km away from point C (see Figure 2.6(b)).

    What is his displacement vector        when he finds the box at point D? What is his displacement vector                      from

    point D to the hole? We have already established that at rest point C his displacement vector is                                         .

    Starting at point C, he walks southwest (toward the campsite), which means his new displacement vector                                   from

    point C to point D is antiparallel to   . Its magnitude     is                                               , so his second

    displacement vector is                       . His total displacement    relative to the campsite is the vector sum of

    the two displacement vectors: vector         (from the campsite to the rest point) and vector                (from the rest

    point to the point where he finds his box):

                                                                                                                                             2.3

    The vector sum of two (or more) vectors is called the resultant vector or, for short, the resultant. When the vectors

    on the right-hand-side of Equation 2.3 are known, we can find the resultant      as follows:

                                                                                                                                             2.4

    When your friend finally reaches the pond at B, his displacement vector      from point A is the vector sum of his

    displacement vector     from point A to point D and his displacement vector      from point D to the fishing hole:

                            (see Figure 2.6(c)). This means his displacement vector  is the difference of two

    vectors:

                                                                                                                                             2.5

    Notice that a difference of two vectors is nothing more than a vector sum of two vectors because the second term in

    Equation 2.5 is vector           (which is antiparallel to  . When we substitute Equation 2.4 into Equation 2.5, we
                                                                                                                                      2.6
    obtain the second displacement vector:

    This result means your friend walked                                             from the point where he finds his
    tackle box to the fishing hole.

    When vectors and lie along a line (that is, in one dimension), such as in the camping example, their resultant

                 and their difference            both lie along the same direction. We can illustrate the addition or

subtraction of vectors by drawing the corresponding vectors to scale in one dimension, as shown in Figure 2.7.

To illustrate the resultant when and are two parallel vectors, we draw them along one line by placing the origin
of one vector at the end of the other vector in head-to-tail fashion (see Figure 2.7(b)). The magnitude of this
resultant is the sum of their magnitudes: R = A + B. The direction of the resultant is parallel to both vectors. When

vector is antiparallel to vector , we draw them along one line in either head-to-head fashion (Figure 2.7(c)) or

tail-to-tail fashion. The magnitude of the vector difference, then, is the absolute value  of the

difference of their magnitudes. The direction of the difference vector  is parallel to the direction of the longer
vector.

In general, in one dimension--as well as in higher dimensions, such as in a plane or in space--we can add any
number of vectors and we can do so in any order because the addition of vectors is commutative,

                                                                                                                    2.7

and associative,
                                                                                                                                                       2.8

Moreover, multiplication by a scalar is distributive:
                                                                                                                                                       2.9

We used the distributive property in Equation 2.4 and Equation 2.6.

When adding many vectors in one dimension, it is convenient to use the concept of a unit vector. A unit vector,

which is denoted by a letter symbol with a hat, such as , has a magnitude of one and does not have any physical

unit so that  . The only role of a unit vector is to specify direction. For example, instead of saying vector

has a magnitude of 6.0 km and a direction of northeast, we can introduce a unit vector that points to the

northeast and say succinctly that  . Then the southwesterly direction is simply given by the unit

vector . In this way, the displacement of 6.0 km in the southwesterly direction is expressed by the vector

A Ladybug Walker

A long measuring stick rests against a wall in a physics laboratory with its 200-cm end at the floor. A ladybug lands
on the 100-cm mark and crawls randomly along the stick. It first walks 15 cm toward the floor, then it walks 56 cm
toward the wall, then it walks 3 cm toward the floor again. Then, after a brief stop, it continues for 25 cm toward the
floor and then, again, it crawls up 19 cm toward the wall before coming to a complete rest (Figure 2.8). Find the
vector of its total displacement and its final resting position on the stick.

Strategy
If we choose the direction along the stick toward the floor as the direction of unit vector , then the direction toward
the floor is and the direction toward the wall is . The ladybug makes a total of five displacements:

    The total displacement is the resultant of all its displacement vectors.

    Solution
    The resultant of all the displacement vectors is

    In this calculation, we use the distributive law given by Equation 2.9. The result reads that the total displacement
    vector points away from the 100-cm mark (initial landing site) toward the end of the meter stick that touches the
    wall. The end that touches the wall is marked 0 cm, so the final position of the ladybug is at the (100 - 32)cm =
    68-cm mark.

    A cave diver enters a long underwater tunnel. When her displacement with respect to the entry point is 20 m, she
    accidentally drops her camera, but she doesn't notice it missing until she is some 6 m farther into the tunnel. She
    swims back 10 m but cannot find the camera, so she decides to end the dive. How far from the entry point is she?
    Taking the positive direction out of the tunnel, what is her displacement vector relative to the entry point?

    Algebra of Vectors in Two Dimensions

    When vectors lie in a plane--that is, when they are in two dimensions--they can be multiplied by scalars, added to
    other vectors, or subtracted from other vectors in accordance with the general laws expressed by Equation 2.1,
    Equation 2.2, Equation 2.7, and Equation 2.8. However, the addition rule for two vectors in a plane becomes more
    complicated than the rule for vector addition in one dimension. We have to use the laws of geometry to construct
    resultant vectors, followed by trigonometry to find vector magnitudes and directions. This geometric approach is
    commonly used in navigation (Figure 2.9). In this section, we need to have at hand two rulers, a triangle, a
    protractor, a pencil, and an eraser for drawing vectors to scale by geometric constructions.

        FIGURE 2.9 In navigation, the laws of geometry are used to draw resultant displacements on nautical maps.

For a geometric construction of the sum of two vectors in a plane, we follow the parallelogram rule. Suppose two

vectors and are at the arbitrary positions shown in Figure 2.10. Translate either one of them in parallel to the
beginning of the other vector, so that after the translation, both vectors have their origins at the same point. Now, at

the end of vector we draw a line parallel to vector and at the end of vector we draw a line parallel to vector
(the dashed lines in Figure 2.10). In this way, we obtain a parallelogram. From the origin of the two vectors we draw

a diagonal that is the resultant of the two vectors:       (Figure 2.10(a)). The other diagonal of this

parallelogram is the vector difference of the two vectors  , as shown in Figure 2.10(b). Notice that the end

of the difference vector is placed at the end of vector .

FIGURE 2.10 The parallelogram rule for the addition of two vectors. Make the parallel translation of each vector to a point where their
origins (marked by the dot) coincide and construct a parallelogram with two sides on the vectors and the other two sides (indicated by

dashed lines) parallel to the vectors. (a) Draw the resultant vector along the diagonal of the parallelogram from the common point to the
opposite corner. Length R of the resultant vector is not equal to the sum of the magnitudes of the two vectors. (b) Draw the difference

vector  along the diagonal connecting the ends of the vectors. Place the origin of vector at the end of vector and the end

(arrowhead) of vector at the end of vector . Length D of the difference vector is not equal to the difference of magnitudes of the two
vectors.

It follows from the parallelogram rule that neither the magnitude of the resultant vector nor the magnitude of the
difference vector can be expressed as a simple sum or difference of magnitudes A and B, because the length of a
diagonal cannot be expressed as a simple sum of side lengths. When using a geometric construction to find

magnitudes and , we have to use trigonometry laws for triangles, which may lead to complicated algebra.

There are two ways to circumvent this algebraic complexity. One way is to use the method of components, which we
examine in the next section. The other way is to draw the vectors to scale, as is done in navigation, and read
approximate vector lengths and angles (directions) from the graphs. In this section we examine the second
approach.
50  2 · Vectors

    If we need to add three or more vectors, we repeat the parallelogram rule for the pairs of vectors until we find the
    resultant of all of the resultants. For three vectors, for example, we first find the resultant of vector 1 and vector 2,
    and then we find the resultant of this resultant and vector 3. The order in which we select the pairs of vectors does
    not matter because the operation of vector addition is commutative and associative (see Equation 2.7 and Equation
    2.8). Before we state a general rule that follows from repetitive applications of the parallelogram rule, let's look at
    the following example.

    Suppose you plan a vacation trip in Florida. Departing from Tallahassee, the state capital, you plan to visit your uncle
    Joe in Jacksonville, see your cousin Vinny in Daytona Beach, stop for a little fun in Orlando, see a circus performance
    in Tampa, and visit the University of Florida in Gainesville. Your route may be represented by five displacement

    vectors , , , and , which are indicated by the red vectors in Figure 2.11. What is your total displacement
    when you reach Gainesville? The total displacement is the vector sum of all five displacement vectors, which may be
    found by using the parallelogram rule four times. Alternatively, recall that the displacement vector has its beginning
    at the initial position (Tallahassee) and its end at the final position (Gainesville), so the total displacement vector can
    be drawn directly as an arrow connecting Tallahassee with Gainesville (see the green vector in Figure 2.11). When

    we use the parallelogram rule four times, the resultant we obtain is exactly this green vector connecting

    Tallahassee with Gainesville:    .

    FIGURE 2.11 When we use the parallelogram rule four times, we obtain the resultant vector  , which is the green
    vector connecting Tallahassee with Gainesville.

    Drawing the resultant vector of many vectors can be generalized by using the following tail-to-head geometric

    construction. Suppose we want to draw the resultant vector of four vectors , , , and (Figure 2.12(a)). We
    select any one of the vectors as the first vector and make a parallel translation of a second vector to a position
    where the origin ("tail") of the second vector coincides with the end ("head") of the first vector. Then, we select a
    third vector and make a parallel translation of the third vector to a position where the origin of the third vector
    coincides with the end of the second vector. We repeat this procedure until all the vectors are in a head-to-tail

arrangement like the one shown in Figure 2.12. We draw the resultant vector by connecting the origin ("tail") of
the first vector with the end ("head") of the last vector. The end of the resultant vector is at the end of the last vector.
Because the addition of vectors is associative and commutative, we obtain the same resultant vector regardless of
which vector we choose to be first, second, third, or fourth in this construction.

directions. (b) Vectors in (a) are translated to new positions where the origin ("tail") of one vector is at the end ("head") of another vector.

EXAMPLE 2.2

Geometric Construction of the Resultant

The three displacement vectors , , and in Figure 2.13 are specified by their magnitudes A = 10.0, B = 7.0, and

C = 8.0, respectively, and by their respective direction angles with the horizontal direction  ,                                        , and

. The physical units of the magnitudes are centimeters. Choose a convenient scale and use a ruler and a

protractor to find the following vector sums: (a)                 , (b)           (c)                                 .

                   FIGURE 2.13 Vectors used in Example 2.2 and in the Check Your Understanding feature that follows.

Strategy

In geometric construction, to find a vector means to find its magnitude and its direction angle with the horizontal
direction. The strategy is to draw to scale the vectors that appear on the right-hand side of the equation and
construct the resultant vector. Then, use a ruler and a protractor to read the magnitude of the resultant and the
direction angle. For parts (a) and (b) we use the parallelogram rule. For (c) we use the tail-to-head method.

Solution

For parts (a) and (b), we attach the origin of vector to the origin of vector , as shown in Figure 2.14, and

construct a parallelogram. The shorter diagonal of this parallelogram is the sum       . The longer of the diagonals

is the difference  . We use a ruler to measure the lengths of the diagonals, and a protractor to measure the

angles with the horizontal. For the resultant , we obtain R = 5.8 cm and          . For the difference , we obtain D

= 16.2 cm and      , which are shown in Figure 2.14.

    For (c), we can start with vector  and draw the remaining vectors tail-to-head as shown in Figure 2.15. In vector

    addition, the order in which we draw the vectors is unimportant, but drawing the vectors to scale is very important.

    Next, we draw vector from the origin of the first vector to the end of the last vector and place the arrowhead at the

    end of . We use a ruler to measure the length of , and find that its magnitude is

    S = 36.9 cm. We use a protractor and find that its direction angle is     . This solution is shown in Figure

2.2 Coordinate Systems and Components of a Vector

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe vectors in two and three dimensions in terms of their components, using unit vectors along the
        axes.

    · Distinguish between the vector components of a vector and the scalar components of a vector.
    · Explain how the magnitude of a vector is defined in terms of the components of a vector.
    · Identify the direction angle of a vector in a plane.
    · Explain the connection between polar coordinates and Cartesian coordinates in a plane.

Vectors are usually described in terms of their components in a coordinate system. Even in everyday life we
naturally invoke the concept of vector components in a rectangular coordinate system. For example, if you ask
someone for directions to a particular location, you will more likely be told to go 40 km east and 30 km north than
50 km in the direction north of east.

In a rectangular (Cartesian) xy-coordinate system in a plane, a point in a plane is described by a pair of coordinates
(x, y). In a similar fashion, a vector in a plane is described by a pair of its vector coordinates. The x-coordinate of
vector is called its x-component and the y-coordinate of vector is called its y-component. The vector
x-component is a vector denoted by . The vector y-component is a vector denoted by . In the Cartesian
system, the x and y vector components of a vector are the orthogonal projections, as illustrated in Figure 2.16, of
this vector onto the x- and y-axes, respectively. In this way, following the parallelogram rule for vector addition,
each vector on a Cartesian plane can be expressed as the vector sum of its vector components:

                                                                                                                                                     2.10

As illustrated in Figure 2.16, vector  is the diagonal of the rectangle where the x-component is the side parallel
to the x-axis and the y-component      is the side parallel to the y-axis. Vector component is orthogonal to vector
component .

FIGURE 2.16 Vector in a plane in the Cartesian coordinate system is the vector sum of its vector x- and y-components. The x-vector
component is the orthogonal projection of vector onto the x-axis. The y-vector component is the orthogonal projection of vector
onto the y-axis. The numbers and that multiply the unit vectors are the scalar components of the vector.

It is customary to denote the positive direction on the x-axis by the unit vector and the positive direction on the
54  2 · Vectors

    y-axis by the unit vector . Unit vectors of the axes, and , define two orthogonal directions in the plane. As
    shown in Figure 2.16, the x- and y- components of a vector can now be written in terms of the unit vectors of the
    axes:

                                                                                                                                                         2.11

    The vectors and defined by Equation 2.11 are the vector components of vector . The numbers and
    that define the vector components in Equation 2.11 are the scalar components of vector . Combining Equation
    2.10 with Equation 2.11, we obtain the component form of a vector:

                                                                                                                                                         2.12

    If we know the coordinates          of the origin point of a vector (where b stands for "beginning") and the

    coordinates     of the end point of a vector (where e stands for "end"), we can obtain the scalar components

    of a vector simply by subtracting the origin point coordinates from the end point coordinates:

                                                                                                                  2.13

    EXAMPLE 2.3

    Displacement of a Mouse Pointer

    A mouse pointer on the display monitor of a computer at its initial position is at point (6.0 cm, 1.6 cm) with respect
    to the lower left-side corner. If you move the pointer to an icon located at point (2.0 cm, 4.5 cm), what is the
    displacement vector of the pointer?

    Strategy
    The origin of the xy-coordinate system is the lower left-side corner of the computer monitor. Therefore, the unit
    vector on the x-axis points horizontally to the right and the unit vector on the y-axis points vertically upward. The
    origin of the displacement vector is located at point b(6.0, 1.6) and the end of the displacement vector is located at
    point e(2.0, 4.5). Substitute the coordinates of these points into Equation 2.13 to find the scalar components

    and of the displacement vector . Finally, substitute the coordinates into Equation 2.12 to write the
    displacement vector in the vector component form.

    Solution

    We identify  ,                   ,  , and    , where the physical unit is 1 cm. The scalar x- and

    y-components of the displacement vector are

    The vector component form of the displacement vector is                                                       2.14

Significance
Notice that the physical unit--here, 1 cm--can be placed either with each component immediately before the unit
vector or globally for both components, as in Equation 2.14. Often, the latter way is more convenient because it is
simpler.

The vector x-component                       of the displacement vector has the magnitude

because the magnitude of the unit vector is                             . Notice, too, that the direction of the

x-component is , which is antiparallel to the direction of the +x-axis; hence, the x-component vector  points to

the left, as shown in Figure 2.17. The scalar x-component of vector is  .

Similarly, the vector y-component            of the displacement vector has magnitude

because the magnitude of the unit vector is  . The direction of the y-component is , which is parallel to the

direction of the +y-axis. Therefore, the y-component vector points up, as seen in Figure 2.17. The scalar

y-component of vector is           . The displacement vector is the resultant of its two vector components.

The vector component form of the displacement vector Equation 2.14 tells us that the mouse pointer has been

When we know the scalar components and of a vector , we can find its magnitude A and its direction angle
    . The direction angle--or direction, for short--is the angle the vector forms with the positive direction on the

x-axis. The angle is measured in the counterclockwise direction from the +x-axis to the vector (Figure 2.18).
Because the lengths A, , and form a right triangle, they are related by the Pythagorean theorem:

                                                                                                                                                     2.15

    Similarly, for vectors in the second quadrant, angle is negative. When the vector lies in either the second or third

In many applications, the magnitudes and directions of vector quantities are known and we need to find the
resultant of many vectors. For example, imagine 400 cars moving on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco in a
strong wind. Each car gives the bridge a different push in various directions and we would like to know how big the
resultant push can possibly be. We have already gained some experience with the geometric construction of vector
sums, so we know the task of finding the resultant by drawing the vectors and measuring their lengths and angles
may become intractable pretty quickly, leading to huge errors. Worries like this do not appear when we use
analytical methods. The very first step in an analytical approach is to find vector components when the direction and
magnitude of a vector are known.

Let us return to the right triangle in Figure 2.18. The quotient of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse A is the

cosine function of direction angle ,       , and the quotient of the opposite side to the hypotenuse A

is the sine function of ,             . When magnitude A and direction are known, we can solve these

relations for the scalar components:

                                                                                                            2.17

When calculating vector components with Equation 2.17, care must be taken with the angle. The direction angle
of a vector is the angle measured counterclockwise from the positive direction on the x-axis to the vector. The
clockwise measurement gives a negative angle.

A rescue party for a missing child follows a search dog named Trooper. Trooper wanders a lot and makes many trial

    runs north some 300.0 m. On the third leg, he examines the scents carefully for 50.0 m in the direction west of
    north. On the fourth leg, Trooper goes directly south for 80.0 m, picks up a fresh scent and turns west of south
    for 150.0 m. Find the scalar components of Trooper's displacement vectors and his displacement vectors in vector
    component form for each leg.

    Strategy

    Let's adopt a rectangular coordinate system with the positive x-axis in the direction of geographic east, with the
    positive y-direction pointed to geographic north. Explicitly, the unit vector of the x-axis points east and the unit
    vector of the y-axis points north. Trooper makes five legs, so there are five displacement vectors. We start by
    identifying their magnitudes and direction angles, then we use Equation 2.17 to find the scalar components of the
    displacements and Equation 2.12 for the displacement vectors.

    Solution

    On the first leg, the displacement magnitude is      and the direction is southeast. For direction angle

    we can take either measured clockwise from the east direction or                 measured counterclockwise from

Polar Coordinates

To describe locations of points or vectors in a plane, we need two orthogonal directions. In the Cartesian coordinate
system these directions are given by unit vectors and along the x-axis and the y-axis, respectively. The Cartesian
coordinate system is very convenient to use in describing displacements and velocities of objects and the forces
acting on them. However, it becomes cumbersome when we need to describe the rotation of objects. When
describing rotation, we usually work in the polar coordinate system.

In the polar coordinate system, the location of point P in a plane is given by two polar coordinates (Figure 2.20).

The first polar coordinate is the radial coordinate r, which is the distance of point P from the origin. The second

polar coordinate is an angle that the radial vector makes with some chosen direction, usually the positive

x-direction. In polar coordinates, angles are measured in radians, or rads. The radial vector is attached at the origin

and points away from the origin to point P. This radial direction is described by a unit radial vector . The second unit

vector is a vector orthogonal to the radial direction . The positive direction indicates how the angle changes

in the counterclockwise direction. In this way, a point P that has coordinates (x, y) in the rectangular system can be

described equivalently in the polar coordinate system by the two polar coordinates  . Equation 2.17 is valid for

any vector, so we can use it to express the x- and y-coordinates of vector . In this way, we obtain the connection

between the polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates of point P:

                                                                                                            2.18

60  2 · Vectors

    Strategy

    The well marks the origin of the coordinate system and east is the +x-direction. We identify radial distances from the

    locations to the origin, which are            (for the silver coin) and  (for the gold coin). To find the

    angular coordinates, we convert to radians:                              . We use Equation 2.18 to find the x- and

    y-coordinates of the coins.

    Solution

    The angular coordinate of the silver coin is         , whereas the angular coordinate of the gold coin is

                   . Hence, the polar coordinates of the silver coin are     and those of the

    gold coin are                             . We substitute these coordinates into Equation 2.18 to obtain rectangular

    coordinates. For the gold coin, the coordinates are

    Vectors in Three Dimensions

    To specify the location of a point in space, we need three coordinates (x, y, z), where coordinates x and y specify
    locations in a plane, and coordinate z gives a vertical position above or below the plane. Three-dimensional space
    has three orthogonal directions, so we need not two but three unit vectors to define a three-dimensional coordinate
    system. In the Cartesian coordinate system, the first two unit vectors are the unit vector of the x-axis and the unit
    vector of the y-axis . The third unit vector is the direction of the z-axis (Figure 2.21). The order in which the axes
    are labeled, which is the order in which the three unit vectors appear, is important because it defines the orientation
    of the coordinate system. The order x-y-z, which is equivalent to the order - - , defines the standard right-
    handed coordinate system (positive orientation). Notice that while previously the y-axis was used for the upward
    direction, in three dimensions we usually choose z to represent the vertical. A right-handed coordinate system with
    z up and with one of the remaining axes pointing to the right and the other out of the page must have the y-axis
    pointing right and x out of the page, as illustrated here.

In three-dimensional space, vector has three vector components: the x-component  , which is the part

z-component  , which is the part of the vector along the z-axis. A vector in three-dimensional space is the

vector sum of its three vector components (Figure 2.22):

                                                                                                              2.19

Magnitude A is obtained by generalizing Equation 2.15 to three dimensions:

This expression for the vector magnitude comes from applying the Pythagorean theorem twice. As seen in Figure

2.22, the diagonal in the xy-plane has length             and its square adds to the square to give . Note that

when the z-component is zero, the vector lies entirely in the xy-plane and its description is reduced to two
dimensions.

Direction of Motion

In a Cartesian coordinate system where denotes geographic east, denotes geographic north, and denotes
altitude above sea level, a military convoy advances its position through unknown territory with velocity

                                         . If the convoy had to retreat, in what geographic direction would it be moving?

Solution

The velocity vector has the third component                 , which says the convoy is climbing at a rate of 100

m/h through mountainous terrain. At the same time, its velocity is 4.0 km/h to the east and 3.0 km/h to the north, so

it moves on the ground in direction               north of east. If the convoy had to retreat, its new velocity

vector would have to be antiparallel to and be in the form  , where is a positive number. Thus, the

velocity of the retreat would be                            . The negative sign of the third component

indicates the convoy would be descending. The direction angle of the retreat velocity is

south of west. Therefore, the convoy would be moving on the ground in direction south of west while

descending on its way back.

The generalization of the number zero to vector algebra is called the null vector, denoted by . All components of

the null vector are zero,            , so the null vector has no length and no direction.

Two vectors and are equal vectors if and only if their difference is the null vector:

This vector equation means we must have simultaneously      ,                             , and      . Hence,
                                                                                                          2.24
we can write  if and only if the corresponding components of vectors and are equal:

Two vectors are equal when their corresponding scalar components are equal.

Resolving vectors into their scalar components (i.e., finding their scalar components) and expressing them
analytically in vector component form (given by Equation 2.19) allows us to use vector algebra to find sums or
differences of many vectors analytically (i.e., without using graphical methods). For example, to find the resultant of
two vectors and , we simply add them component by component, as follows:

In this way, using Equation 2.24, scalar components of the resultant vector                      are the sums of

    Having found the scalar components, we can write the resultant in vector component form:

    Analytical methods for finding the resultant and, in general, for solving vector equations are very important in
    physics because many physical quantities are vectors. For example, we use this method in kinematics to find
    resultant displacement vectors and resultant velocity vectors, in mechanics to find resultant force vectors and the

Hence, the difference vector is                               .

For (c), we can write vector in the following explicit form:

the same problems obtained with the graphical method, shown in Figure 2.14 and Figure 2.15. Notice that the

    The Tug-of-War Game

    Four dogs named Astro, Balto, Clifford, and Dug play a tug-of-war game with a toy (Figure 2.25). Astro pulls on the

    toy in direction          south of east, Balto pulls in direction         east of north, and Clifford pulls in direction

    west of north. Astro pulls strongly with 160.0 units of force (N), which we abbreviate as A = 160.0 N. Balto

    pulls even stronger than Astro with a force of magnitude B = 200.0 N, and Clifford pulls with a force of magnitude C

    = 140.0 N. When Dug pulls on the toy in such a way that his force balances out the resultant of the other three

    forces, the toy does not move in any direction. With how big a force and in what direction must Dug pull on the toy

    for this to happen?

    Strategy

    We assume that east is the direction of the positive x-axis and north is the direction of the positive y-axis. As in

    Example 2.9, we have to resolve the three given forces-- (the pull from Astro), (the pull from Balto), and (the
    pull from Clifford)--into their scalar components and then find the scalar components of the resultant vector

                      . When the pulling force from Dug balances out this resultant, the sum of and must give the

    null vector          . This means that     , so the pull from Dug must be antiparallel to .

    Solution

    The direction angles are                ,                          , and                   , and substituting them

combined pulls from Clifford and Astro? Illustrate this situation by drawing a vector diagram indicating all forces

    Displacement of a Skier

    Starting at a ski lodge, a cross-country skier goes 5.0 km north, then 3.0 km west, and finally 4.0 km southwest
    before taking a rest. Find their total displacement vector relative to the lodge when they are at the rest point. How
    far and in what direction must they ski from the rest point to return directly to the lodge?

    Strategy

    We assume a rectangular coordinate system with the origin at the ski lodge and with the unit vector pointing east

    and the unit vector    pointing north. There are three displacements: , , and . We identify their magnitudes

    as           ,                   , and         . We identify their directions are the angles               ,           ,

    and                              . We resolve each displacement vector to its scalar components and substitute the

    components into Equation 2.25 to obtain the scalar components of the resultant displacement from the lodge to

    the rest point. On the way back from the rest point to the lodge, the displacement is       . Finally, we find the

    magnitude and direction of .

    Solution
    Scalar components of the displacement vectors are

    Scalar components of the net displacement vector are

    Hence, the skier's net displacement vector is                                          . On the way back to the lodge,

    their displacement is                                 . Its magnitude is

                                                          and its direction angle is                                  .

    Therefore, to return to the lodge, they must go 6.2 km in a direction about south of east.

    Notice that no figure is needed to solve this problem by the analytical method. Figures are required when using a

                                      FIGURE 2.26 A jogger runs up a flight of steps.

Strategy

The displacement vector    is the vector sum of the jogger's displacement vector       along the stairs (from

point A at the bottom of the stairs to point T at the top of the stairs) and his displacement vector   on the top of

the hill (from point T at the top of the stairs to the fountain at point B). We must find the horizontal and the vertical

components of . If each step has width w and height h, the horizontal component of     must have a length of

200w and the vertical component must have a length of 200h. The actual distance the jogger covers is the sum of

the distance he runs up the stairs and the distance of 50.0 m that he runs along the top of the hill.

Solution
In the coordinate system indicated in Figure 2.26, the jogger's displacement vector on the top of the hill is

                          . His net displacement vector is

Therefore, his displacement vector    along the stairs is

Its scalar components are             and                  . Therefore, we must have

Hence, the step width is w = 40.0 m/200 = 0.2 m = 20 cm, and the step height is h = 30.0 m/200 = 0.15 m = 15 cm.
The distance that the jogger covers along the stairs is

Thus, the actual distance he runs is                                                   . When he makes a loop and comes

back from the fountain to his initial position at point A, the total distance he covers is twice this distance, or 200.0

m. However, his net displacement vector is zero, because when his final position is the same as his initial position,

the scalar components of his net displacement vector are zero (Equation 2.13).

In many physical situations, we often need to know the direction of a vector. For example, we may want to know the
direction of a magnetic field vector at some point or the direction of motion of an object. We have already said
direction is given by a unit vector, which is a dimensionless entity--that is, it has no physical units associated with it.
When the vector in question lies along one of the axes in a Cartesian system of coordinates, the answer is simple,
because then its unit vector of direction is either parallel or antiparallel to the direction of the unit vector of an axis.

For example, the direction of vector  is unit vector       . The general rule of finding the unit vector of
70  2 · Vectors

    direction for any vector is to divide it by its magnitude V:

                                                                     2.26

    We see from this expression that the unit vector of direction is indeed dimensionless because the numerator and the
    denominator in Equation 2.26 have the same physical unit. In this way, Equation 2.26 allows us to express the unit
    vector of direction in terms of unit vectors of the axes. The following example illustrates this principle.

    If the velocity vector of the military convoy in Example 2.8 is

    Strategy
    The unit vector of the convoy's direction of motion is the unit vector that is parallel to the velocity vector. The unit
    vector is obtained by dividing a vector by its magnitude, in accordance with Equation 2.26.

    Solution
    The magnitude of the vector is

    To obtain the unit vector , divide by its magnitude:

    Significance
    Note that when using the analytical method with a calculator, it is advisable to carry out your calculations to at least
    three decimal places and then round off the final answer to the required number of significant figures, which is the
    way we performed calculations in this example. If you round off your partial answer too early, you risk your final
    answer having a huge numerical error, and it may be far off from the exact answer or from a value measured in an
    experiment.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the difference between the scalar product and the vector product of two vectors.
    · Determine the scalar product of two vectors.
    · Determine the vector product of two vectors.
    · Describe how the products of vectors are used in physics.

A vector can be multiplied by another vector but may not be divided by another vector. There are two kinds of
products of vectors used broadly in physics and engineering. One kind of multiplication is a scalar multiplication of
two vectors. Taking a scalar product of two vectors results in a number (a scalar), as its name indicates. Scalar
products are used to define work and energy relations. For example, the work that a force (a vector) performs on an
object while causing its displacement (a vector) is defined as a scalar product of the force vector with the
displacement vector. A quite different kind of multiplication is a vector multiplication of vectors. Taking a vector
product of two vectors returns as a result a vector, as its name suggests. Vector products are used to define other
derived vector quantities. For example, in describing rotations, a vector quantity called torque is defined as a vector
product of an applied force (a vector) and its distance from pivot to force (a vector). It is important to distinguish
between these two kinds of vector multiplications because the scalar product is a scalar quantity and a vector
product is a vector quantity.

The Scalar Product of Two Vectors (the Dot Product)

Scalar multiplication of two vectors yields a scalar product.

SCALAR PRODUCT (DOT PRODUCT)

The scalar product  of two vectors and is a number defined by the equation

                                                                                                                     2.27

where is the angle between the vectors (shown in Figure 2.27). The scalar product is also called the dot
product because of the dot notation that indicates it.

In the definition of the dot product, the direction of angle  does not matter, and can be measured from either of
the two vectors to the other because                                          . The dot product is a negative number when

                       and is a positive number when             . Moreover, the dot product of two parallel vectors is

                    , and the dot product of two antiparallel vectors is                                             . The

scalar product of two orthogonal vectors vanishes:                        . The scalar product of a vector with
itself is the square of its magnitude:

                                                                                                                     2.28

    From Figure 2.13, the magnitudes of vectors and are A = 10.0 and F = 20.0. Angle , between them, is the

    difference:                             . Substituting these values into Equation 2.27 gives the scalar product.

    A straightforward calculation gives us

    For the vectors given in Figure 2.13, find the scalar products

    In the Cartesian coordinate system, scalar products of the unit vector of an axis with other unit vectors of axes
    always vanish because these unit vectors are orthogonal:

                                                                                                                       2.29

    In these equations, we use the fact that the magnitudes of all unit vectors are one:               . For unit
    vectors of the axes, Equation 2.28 gives the following identities:                                             2.30

    The scalar product  can also be interpreted as either the product of B with the projection of vector onto

    the direction of vector (Figure 2.27(b)) or the product of A with the projection of vector onto the direction of

    vector (Figure 2.27(c)):

    For example, in the rectangular coordinate system in a plane, the scalar x-component of a vector is its dot product
    with the unit vector , and the scalar y-component of a vector is its dot product with the unit vector :

    Scalar multiplication of vectors is commutative,                                                                   2.31

We can use the commutative and distributive laws to derive various relations for vectors, such as expressing the dot
product of two vectors in terms of their scalar components.

show that
                          and                    .

When the vectors in Equation 2.27 are given in their vector component forms,

we can compute their scalar product as follows:

Since scalar products of two different unit vectors of axes give zero, and scalar products of unit vectors with
themselves give one (see Equation 2.29 and Equation 2.30), there are only three nonzero terms in this expression.
Thus, the scalar product simplifies to

                                                                                                                                                     2.33

We can use Equation 2.33 for the scalar product in terms of scalar components of vectors to find the angle between

two vectors. When we divide Equation 2.27 by AB, we obtain the equation for   , into which we substitute

Equation 2.33:

Angle between vectors and is obtained by taking the inverse cosine of the expression in Equation 2.34.

    standard right-handed orientation, where the angle between vectors is measured counterclockwise from the first

    vector, vector       points upward, as seen in Figure 2.29(a). If we reverse the order of multiplication, so that now

    comes first in the product, then vector  must point downward, as seen in Figure 2.29(b). This means that

    vectors         and              are antiparallel to each other and that vector multiplication is not commutative but

    anticommutative. The anticommutative property means the vector product reverses the sign when the order of

    multiplication is reversed:

    The corkscrew right-hand rule is a common mnemonic used to determine the direction of the vector product. As

    shown in Figure 2.30, a corkscrew is placed in a direction perpendicular to the plane that contains vectors and ,
    and its handle is turned in the direction from the first to the second vector in the product. The direction of the cross
    product is given by the progression of the corkscrew.

EXAMPLE 2.18

The Torque of a Force

The mechanical advantage that a familiar tool called a wrench provides (Figure 2.31) depends on magnitude F of the
applied force, on its direction with respect to the wrench handle, and on how far from the nut this force is applied.

The distance R from the nut to the point where force vector is attached is represented by the radial vector . The
physical vector quantity that makes the nut turn is called torque (denoted by , and it is the vector product of the

distance between the pivot to force with the force:                  .

To loosen a rusty nut, a 20.00-N force is applied to the wrench handle at angle        and at a distance of 0.25 m

from the nut, as shown in Figure 2.31(a). Find the magnitude and direction of the torque applied to the nut. What

would the magnitude and direction of the torque be if the force were applied at angle  , as shown in Figure

2.31(b)? For what value of angle does the torque have the largest magnitude?

FIGURE 2.31 A wrench provides grip and mechanical advantage in applying torque to turn a nut. (a) Turn counterclockwise to loosen the
nut. (b) Turn clockwise to tighten the nut.

Strategy

We adopt the frame of reference shown in Figure 2.31, where vectors and lie in the xy-plane and the origin is at

the position of the nut. The radial direction along vector (pointing away from the origin) is the reference direction

for measuring the angle because is the first vector in the vector product              . Vector must lie along

the z-axis because this is the axis that is perpendicular to the xy-plane, where both and lie. To compute the
magnitude , we use Equation 2.35. To find the direction of , we use the corkscrew right-hand rule (Figure 2.30).

Solution

For the situation in (a), the corkscrew rule gives the direction of     in the positive direction of the z-axis.

Physically, it means the torque vector points out of the page, perpendicular to the wrench handle. We identify F =

20.00 N and R = 0.25 m, and compute the magnitude using Equation 2.35:

For the situation in (b), the corkscrew rule gives the direction of     in the negative direction of the z-axis.

Physically, it means the vector points into the page, perpendicular to the wrench handle. The magnitude of this

torque is
78  2 · Vectors

    The torque has the largest value when  , which happens when                        . Physically, it means the wrench is

    most effective--giving us the best mechanical advantage--when we apply the force perpendicular to the wrench

    handle. For the situation in this example, this best-torque value is                                                       .

    Significance

    When solving mechanics problems, we often do not need to use the corkscrew rule at all, as we'll see now in the

    following equivalent solution. Notice that once we have identified that vector        lies along the z-axis, we can

    write this vector in terms of the unit vector of the z-axis:

    In this equation, the number that multiplies is the scalar z-component of the vector       . In the computation of

    this component, care must be taken that the angle is measured counterclockwise from (first vector) to

    (second vector). Following this principle for the angles, we obtain                        for the situation in

    (a), and we obtain                     for the situation in (b). In the latter case, the angle is negative

    because the graph in Figure 2.31 indicates the angle is measured clockwise; but, the same result is obtained when

    this angle is measured counterclockwise because                            and                                  . In this

    way, we obtain the solution without reference to the corkscrew rule. For the situation in (a), the solution is

                        ; for the situation in (b), the solution is                       .

    For the vectors given in Figure 2.13, find the vector products

    Similar to the dot product (Equation 2.32), the cross product has the following distributive property:

                                                                                                                    2.37

    The distributive property is applied frequently when vectors are expressed in their component forms, in terms of
    unit vectors of Cartesian axes.

    When we apply the definition of the cross product, Equation 2.35, to unit vectors , , and  that define the positive
    x-, y-, and z-directions in space, we find that                                                                     2.38

    All other cross products of these three unit vectors must be vectors of unit magnitudes because , , and are

    orthogonal. For example, for the pair and , the magnitude is                               . The direction of

    the vector product  must be orthogonal to the xy-plane, which means it must be along the z-axis. The only unit

    vectors along the z-axis are or . By the corkscrew rule, the direction of vector           must be parallel to the

    positive z-axis. Therefore, the result of the multiplication     is identical to . We can repeat similar reasoning

    for the remaining pairs of unit vectors. The results of these multiplications are

                                                                                                                    2.39

    Figure 2.32(a). The cyclic order means that in the product formula, follows and comes before , or follows

third unit vector. When two unit vectors in the cross product appear in the cyclic order, the result of such a
multiplication is the remaining unit vector, as illustrated in Figure 2.32(b). When unit vectors in the cross product
appear in a different order, the result is a unit vector that is antiparallel to the remaining unit vector (i.e., the result is
with the minus sign, as shown by the examples in Figure 2.32(c) and Figure 2.32(d). In practice, when the task is to
find cross products of vectors that are given in vector component form, this rule for the cross-multiplication of unit
vectors is very useful.

Suppose we want to find the cross product  for vectors                                 and                                                                 .

We can use the distributive property (Equation 2.37), the anticommutative property (Equation 2.36), and the results

in Equation 2.38 and Equation 2.39 for unit vectors to perform the following algebra:

When performing algebraic operations involving the cross product, be very careful about keeping the correct order
of multiplication because the cross product is anticommutative. The last two steps that we still have to do to
complete our task are, first, grouping the terms that contain a common unit vector and, second, factoring. In this
way we obtain the following very useful expression for the computation of the cross product:

                                                                                                                                                     2.40

    In this expression, the scalar components of the cross-product vector are

    When finding the cross product, in practice, we can use either Equation 2.35 or Equation 2.40, depending on which
    one of them seems to be less complex computationally. They both lead to the same final result. One way to make
    sure if the final result is correct is to use them both.

    EXAMPLE 2.19

    A Particle in a Magnetic Field

    When moving in a magnetic field, some particles may experience a magnetic force. Without going into details--a
    detailed study of magnetic phenomena comes in later chapters--let's acknowledge that the magnetic field is a
    vector, the magnetic force is a vector, and the velocity of the particle is a vector. The magnetic force vector is
    proportional to the vector product of the velocity vector with the magnetic field vector, which we express as

                     . In this equation, a constant takes care of the consistency in physical units, so we can omit physical
    units on vectors and . In this example, let's assume the constant is positive.

    A particle moving in space with velocity vector                           enters a region with a magnetic field and

    experiences a magnetic force. Find the magnetic force on this particle at the entry point to the region where the

    magnetic field vector is (a)                     and (b)  . In each case, find magnitude F of the magnetic

    force and angle the force vector makes with the given magnetic field vector .

    Strategy

    First, we want to find the vector product        , because then we can determine the magnetic force using

                 . Magnitude F can be found either by using components,                  , or by computing the

    magnitude           directly using Equation 2.35. In the latter approach, we would have to find the angle between

    vectors and . When we have , the general method for finding the direction angle involves the computation of

    the scalar product      and substitution into Equation 2.34. To compute the vector product we can either use

    Equation 2.40 or compute the product directly, whichever way is simpler.

    Solution

    The components of the velocity vector are            ,    , and                   .

    (a) The components of the magnetic field vector are       ,                , and     . Substituting them into
    Equation 2.41 gives the scalar components of vector            :

    Thus, the magnetic force is                               and its magnitude is

    To compute angle , we may need to find the magnitude of the magnetic field vector,

    and the scalar product           :

                                                                           2.4 · Products of Vectors                  81

Now, substituting into Equation 2.34 gives angle :

Hence, the magnetic force vector is perpendicular to the magnetic field vector. (We could have saved some time if
we had computed the scalar product earlier.)

(b) Because vector            has only one component, we can perform the algebra quickly and find the vector
product directly:

The magnitude of the magnetic force is

Because the scalar product is

the magnetic force vector is perpendicular to the magnetic field vector .

Significance

Even without actually computing the scalar product, we can predict that the magnetic force vector must always be
perpendicular to the magnetic field vector because of the way this vector is constructed. Namely, the magnetic force

vector is the vector product            and, by the definition of the vector product (see Figure 2.29), vector

must be perpendicular to both vectors and .

In conclusion to this section, we want to stress that "dot product" and "cross product" are entirely different
mathematical objects that have different meanings. The dot product is a scalar; the cross product is a vector. Later
chapters use the terms dot product and scalar product interchangeably. Similarly, the terms cross product and
vector product are used interchangeably.

INTRODUCTION Our universe is full of objects in motion. From the stars, planets, and galaxies; to the motion of
people and animals; down to the microscopic scale of atoms and molecules--everything in our universe is in motion.
We can describe motion using the two disciplines of kinematics and dynamics. We study dynamics, which is
concerned with the causes of motion, in Newton's Laws of Motion; but, there is much to be learned about motion
without referring to what causes it, and this is the study of kinematics. Kinematics involves describing motion
through properties such as position, time, velocity, and acceleration.
A full treatment of kinematics considers motion in two and three dimensions. For now, we discuss motion in one
dimension, which provides us with the tools necessary to study multidimensional motion. A good example of an
object undergoing one-dimensional motion is the maglev (magnetic levitation) train depicted at the beginning of this
chapter. As it travels, say, from Tokyo to Kyoto, it is at different positions along the track at various times in its
journey, and therefore has displacements, or changes in position. It also has a variety of velocities along its path and
it undergoes accelerations (changes in velocity). With the skills learned in this chapter we can calculate these
quantities and average velocity. All these quantities can be described using kinematics, without knowing the train's
mass or the forces involved.
96  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

    3.1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Define position, displacement, and distance traveled.
        · Calculate the total displacement given the position as a function of time.
        · Determine the total distance traveled.
        · Calculate the average velocity given the displacement and elapsed time.

    When you're in motion, the basic questions to ask are: Where are you? Where are you going? How fast are you
    getting there? The answers to these questions require that you specify your position, your displacement, and your
    average velocity--the terms we define in this section.

    Position

    To describe the motion of an object, you must first be able to describe its position (x): where it is at any particular
    time. More precisely, we need to specify its position relative to a convenient frame of reference. A frame of reference
    is an arbitrary set of axes from which the position and motion of an object are described. Earth is often used as a
    frame of reference, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects on Earth. For
    example, a rocket launch could be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to Earth as a whole,
    whereas a cyclist's position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the buildings she passes
    Figure 3.2. In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to Earth. To
    describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not Earth, as the reference frame.
    To describe the position of an object undergoing one-dimensional motion, we often use the variable x. Later in the
    chapter, during the discussion of free fall, we use the variable y.

    FIGURE 3.2 These cyclists in Vietnam can be described by their position relative to buildings or a canal. Their motion can be described by
    their change in position, or displacement, in a frame of reference. (credit: modification of work by Suzan Black)

    Displacement

    If an object moves relative to a frame of reference--for example, if a professor moves to the right relative to a
    whiteboard Figure 3.3--then the object's position changes. This change in position is called displacement. The word
    displacement implies that an object has moved, or has been displaced. Although position is the numerical value of x
    along a straight line where an object might be located, displacement gives the change in position along this line.
    Since displacement indicates direction, it is a vector and can be either positive or negative, depending on the choice
    of positive direction. Also, an analysis of motion can have many displacements embedded in it. If right is positive
    and an object moves 2 m to the right, then 4 m to the left, the individual displacements are 2 m and m,
    respectively.

FIGURE 3.3 A professor paces left and right while lecturing. Her position relative to Earth is given by x. The +2.0-m displacement of the
professor relative to Earth is represented by an arrow pointing to the right.

  DISPLACEMENT

  Displacement is the change in position of an object:
                                                                                                                                                    3.1

  where is displacement, is the final position, and is the initial position.

We use the uppercase Greek letter delta () to mean "change in" whatever quantity follows it; thus, means
change in position (final position less initial position). We always solve for displacement by subtracting initial
position from final position . Note that the SI unit for displacement is the meter, but sometimes we use
kilometers or other units of length. Keep in mind that when units other than meters are used in a problem, you may
need to convert them to meters to complete the calculation (see Appendix B).
Objects in motion can also have a series of displacements. In the previous example of the pacing professor, the
individual displacements are 2 m and m, giving a total displacement of -2 m. We define total displacement

          , as the sum of the individual displacements, and express this mathematically with the equation
                                                                                                                                                       3.2

where are the individual displacements. In the earlier example,

Similarly,

Thus,

The total displacement is 2 - 4 = -2 m along the x-axis. It is also useful to calculate the magnitude of the
displacement, or its size. The magnitude of the displacement is always positive. This is the absolute value of the
98  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

    displacement, because displacement is a vector and cannot have a negative value of magnitude. In our example, the
    magnitude of the total displacement is 2 m, whereas the magnitudes of the individual displacements are 2 m and 4
    m.

    The magnitude of the total displacement should not be confused with the distance traveled. Distance traveled
            , is the total length of the path traveled between two positions. In the previous problem, the distance

    traveled is the sum of the magnitudes of the individual displacements:

    Average Velocity

    To calculate the other physical quantities in kinematics we must introduce the time variable. The time variable
    allows us not only to state where the object is (its position) during its motion, but also how fast it is moving. How fast
    an object is moving is given by the rate at which the position changes with time.

    For each position , we assign a particular time . If the details of the motion at each instant are not important, the
    rate is usually expressed as the average velocity . This vector quantity is simply the total displacement between
    two points divided by the time taken to travel between them. The time taken to travel between two points is called
    the elapsed time .

    It is important to note that the average velocity is a vector and can be negative, depending on positions and .

    EXAMPLE 3.1

    Delivering Flyers

    Jill sets out from her home to deliver flyers for her yard sale, traveling due east along her street lined with houses. At

    km and 9 minutes later she runs out of flyers and has to retrace her steps back to her house to get more. This

    takes an additional 9 minutes. After picking up more flyers, she sets out again on the same path, continuing where

    she left off, and ends up 1.0 km from her house. This third leg of her trip takes minutes. At this point she turns

    back toward her house, heading west. After  km and minutes she stops to rest.

Strategy
The problem contains data on the various legs of Jill's trip, so it would be useful to make a table of the physical
quantities. We are given position and time in the wording of the problem so we can calculate the displacements and
the elapsed time. We take east to be the positive direction. From this information we can find the total displacement
and average velocity. Jill's home is the starting point . The following table gives Jill's time and position in the first
two columns, and the displacements are calculated in the third column.

                                   Time ti (min) Position (km) Displacement (km)

Solution

b. The magnitude of the total displacement is         .

c.

d. The total distance traveled (sum of magnitudes of individual displacements) is
                                                                                      .

e. We can graph Jill's position versus time as a useful aid to see the motion; the graph is shown in Figure 3.5.
100  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     FIGURE 3.5 This graph depicts Jill's position versus time. The average velocity is the slope of a line connecting the initial and final
     points.

     Significance

     Jill's total displacement is -0.75 km, which means at the end of her trip she ends up  due west of her home.

     The average velocity means if someone was to walk due west at  km/min starting at the same time Jill left her

     home, they both would arrive at the final stopping point at the same time. Note that if Jill were to end her trip at her

     house, her total displacement would be zero, as well as her average velocity. The total distance traveled during the

     58 minutes of elapsed time for her trip is 3.75 km.

     3.2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity.
         · Describe the difference between velocity and speed.
         · Calculate the instantaneous velocity given the mathematical equation for the position.
         · Calculate the speed given the instantaneous velocity.
     We have now seen how to calculate the average velocity between two positions. However, since objects in the real
     world move continuously through space and time, we would like to find the velocity of an object at any single point.
     We can find the velocity of the object anywhere along its path by using some fundamental principles of calculus.
     This section gives us better insight into the physics of motion and will be useful in later chapters.

usually called simply velocity. It is the average velocity between two points on the path in the limit that the time
(and therefore the displacement) between the two events approaches zero. To illustrate this idea mathematically,
we need to express position x as a continuous function of t denoted by x(t). The expression for the average velocity

between two points using this notation is    . To find the instantaneous velocity at any position, we let

         and           . After inserting these expressions into the equation for the average velocity and taking the
limit as      , we find the expression for the instantaneous velocity:

INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY

The instantaneous velocity of an object is the limit of the average velocity as the elapsed time approaches zero,
or the derivative of x with respect to t:

                                                                                                                                                 3.4

Like average velocity, instantaneous velocity is a vector with dimension of length per time. The instantaneous
velocity at a specific time point is the rate of change of the position function, which is the slope of the position

function at . Figure 3.6 shows how the average velocity  between two times approaches the

instantaneous velocity at The instantaneous velocity is shown at time , which happens to be at the maximum

of the position function. The slope of the position graph is zero at this point, and thus the instantaneous velocity is

zero. At other times,  , and so on, the instantaneous velocity is not zero because the slope of the position graph

would be positive or negative. If the position function had a minimum, the slope of the position graph would also be

zero, giving an instantaneous velocity of zero there as well. Thus, the zeros of the velocity function give the minimum

and maximum of the position function.

FIGURE 3.6 In a graph of position versus time, the instantaneous velocity is the slope of the tangent line at a given point. The average

velocities             between times                     are shown. When                  , the average velocity

approaches the instantaneous velocity at  .

Finding Velocity from a Position-Versus-Time Graph

Given the position-versus-time graph of Figure 3.7, find the velocity-versus-time graph.
102  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     FIGURE 3.7 The object starts out in the positive direction, stops for a short time, and then reverses direction, heading back toward the
     origin. Notice that the object comes to rest instantaneously, which would require an infinite force. Thus, the graph is an approximation of
     motion in the real world. (The concept of force is discussed in Newton's Laws of Motion.)

     Strategy
     The graph contains three straight lines during three time intervals. We find the velocity during each time interval by
     taking the slope of the line using the grid.
     Solution
     Time interval 0 s to 0.5 s:
     Time interval 0.5 s to 1.0 s:
     Time interval 1.0 s to 2.0 s:
     The graph of these values of velocity versus time is shown in Figure 3.8.

     FIGURE 3.8 The velocity is positive for the first part of the trip, zero when the object is stopped, and negative when the object reverses
     direction.

     Significance
     During the time interval between 0 s and 0.5 s, the object's position is moving away from the origin and the position-
     versus-time curve has a positive slope. At any point along the curve during this time interval, we can find the
     instantaneous velocity by taking its slope, which is +1 m/s, as shown in Figure 3.8. In the subsequent time interval,
     between 0.5 s and 1.0 s, the position doesn't change and we see the slope is zero. From 1.0 s to 2.0 s, the object is
     moving back toward the origin and the slope is -0.5 m/s. The object has reversed direction and has a negative
     velocity.

Speed

In everyday language, most people use the terms speed and velocity interchangeably. In physics, however, they do
not have the same meaning and are distinct concepts. One major difference is that speed has no direction; that is,
speed is a scalar.
We can calculate the average speed by finding the total distance traveled divided by the elapsed time:

                                                                                                                                                       3.5

Average speed is not necessarily the same as the magnitude of the average velocity, which is found by dividing the
magnitude of the total displacement by the elapsed time. For example, if a trip starts and ends at the same location,
the total displacement is zero, and therefore the average velocity is zero. The average speed, however, is not zero,
because the total distance traveled is greater than zero. If we take a road trip of 300 km and need to be at our
destination at a certain time, then we would be interested in our average speed.

However, we can calculate the instantaneous speed from the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity:

                                                                                                                                                       3.6

If a particle is moving along the x-axis at +7.0 m/s and another particle is moving along the same axis at -7.0 m/s,
they have different velocities, but both have the same speed of 7.0 m/s. Some typical speeds are shown in the
following table.

Calculating Instantaneous Velocity

When calculating instantaneous velocity, we need to specify the explicit form of the position function . If each
term in the equation has the form of where is a constant and is an integer, this can be differentiated
104  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     using the power rule to be:
                                                                                                                                                            3.7

     Note that if there are additional terms added together, this power rule of differentiation can be done multiple times
     and the solution is the sum of those terms. The following example illustrates the use of Equation 3.7.

         EXAMPLE 3.3

     Instantaneous Velocity Versus Average Velocity

     The position of a particle is given by                      .

     a. Using Equation 3.4 and Equation 3.7, find the instantaneous velocity at  s.

     b. Calculate the average velocity between 1.0 s and 3.0 s.

     Strategy

     Equation 3.4 gives the instantaneous velocity of the particle as the derivative of the position function. Looking at the
     form of the position function given, we see that it is a polynomial in t. Therefore, we can use Equation 3.7, the power
     rule from calculus, to find the solution. We use Equation 3.6 to calculate the average velocity of the particle.

     Solution

     a.                                      .

         Substituting t = 2.0 s into this equation gives                                             .

     b. To determine the average velocity of the particle between 1.0 s and 3.0 s, we calculate the values of x(1.0 s)

Significance
The velocity of the particle gives us direction information, indicating the particle is moving to the left (west) or right
(east). The speed gives the magnitude of the velocity. By graphing the position, velocity, and speed as functions of
time, we can understand these concepts visually Figure 3.9. In (a), the graph shows the particle moving in the
positive direction until t = 0.5 s, when it reverses direction. The reversal of direction can also be seen in (b) at 0.5 s
where the velocity is zero and then turns negative. At 1.0 s it is back at the origin where it started. The particle's
velocity at 1.0 s in (b) is negative, because it is traveling in the negative direction. But in (c), however, its speed is
positive and remains positive throughout the travel time. We can also interpret velocity as the slope of the position-
versus-time graph. The slope of x(t) is decreasing toward zero, becoming zero at 0.5 s and increasingly negative
thereafter. This analysis of comparing the graphs of position, velocity, and speed helps catch errors in calculations.
The graphs must be consistent with each other and help interpret the calculations.

of the slopes of the tangent lines in (a) at 0.25 s, 0.5 s, and 1.0 s with the values for velocity at the corresponding times indicates they are

the same values. (c) Speed:  versus time. Speed is always a positive number.

3.3 Average and Instantaneous Acceleration

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Calculate the average acceleration between two points in time.
    · Calculate the instantaneous acceleration given the functional form of velocity.
    · Explain the vector nature of instantaneous acceleration and velocity.
    · Explain the difference between average acceleration and instantaneous acceleration.
    · Find instantaneous acceleration at a specified time on a graph of velocity versus time.

The importance of understanding acceleration spans our day-to-day experience, as well as the vast reaches of outer
space and the tiny world of subatomic physics. In everyday conversation, to accelerate means to speed up; applying
the brake pedal causes a vehicle to slow down. We are familiar with the acceleration of our car, for example. The
greater the acceleration, the greater the change in velocity over a given time. Acceleration is widely seen in
experimental physics. In linear particle accelerator experiments, for example, subatomic particles are accelerated
to very high velocities in collision experiments, which tell us information about the structure of the subatomic world
106  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     as well as the origin of the universe. In space, cosmic rays are subatomic particles that have been accelerated to
     very high energies in supernovas (exploding massive stars) and active galactic nuclei. It is important to understand
     the processes that accelerate cosmic rays because these rays contain highly penetrating radiation that can damage
     electronics flown on spacecraft, for example.

     Average Acceleration

     The formal definition of acceleration is consistent with these notions just described, but is more inclusive.

       AVERAGE ACCELERATION

       Average acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes:
                                                                                                                                                         3.8

       where is average acceleration, v is velocity, and t is time. (The bar over the a means average acceleration.)

     Because acceleration is velocity in meters per second divided by time in seconds, the SI units for acceleration are
     often abbreviated m/s2--that is, meters per second squared or meters per second per second. This literally means
     by how many meters per second the velocity changes every second. Recall that velocity is a vector--it has both
     magnitude and direction--which means that a change in velocity can be a change in magnitude (or speed), but it can
     also be a change in direction. For example, if a runner traveling at 10 km/h due east slows to a stop, reverses
     direction, and continues her run at 10 km/h due west, her velocity has changed as a result of the change in direction,
     although the magnitude of the velocity is the same in both directions. Thus, acceleration occurs when velocity
     changes in magnitude (an increase or decrease in speed) or in direction, or both.

       ACCELERATION AS A VECTOR

       Acceleration is a vector in the same direction as the change in velocity, . Since velocity is a vector, it can
       change in magnitude or in direction, or both. Acceleration is, therefore, a change in speed or direction, or both.

     Keep in mind that although acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity, it is not always in the direction of
     motion. When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion. Although this is
     commonly referred to as deceleration Figure 3.10, we say the train is accelerating in a direction opposite to its
     direction of motion.

     FIGURE 3.10 A subway train in Sao Paulo, Brazil, accelerates opposite to the motion as it comes into a station. It is accelerating in a
     direction opposite to its direction of motion. (credit: modification of work by Yusuke Kawasaki)

     The term deceleration can cause confusion in our analysis because it is not a vector and it does not point to a
     specific direction with respect to a coordinate system, so we do not use it. Acceleration is a vector, so we must
     choose the appropriate sign for it in our chosen coordinate system. In the case of the train in Figure 3.10,

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                          3.3 · Average and Instantaneous Acceleration                                                      107

acceleration is in the negative direction in the chosen coordinate system, so we say the train is undergoing negative
acceleration.

If an object in motion has a velocity in the positive direction with respect to a chosen origin and it acquires a
constant negative acceleration, the object eventually comes to a rest and reverses direction. If we wait long enough,
the object passes through the origin going in the opposite direction. This is illustrated in Figure 3.11.

FIGURE 3.11 An object in motion with a velocity vector toward the east under negative acceleration comes to a rest and reverses direction.
It passes the origin going in the opposite direction after a long enough time.

        EXAMPLE 3.5

Calculating Average Acceleration: A Racehorse Leaves the Gate

A racehorse coming out of the gate accelerates from rest to a velocity of 15.0 m/s due west in 1.80 s. What is its
average acceleration?

                           FIGURE 3.12 Racehorses accelerating out of the gate. (credit: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)

Strategy
First we draw a sketch and assign a coordinate system to the problem Figure 3.13. This is a simple problem, but it
always helps to visualize it. Notice that we assign east as positive and west as negative. Thus, in this case, we have
negative velocity.

FIGURE 3.13 Identify the coordinate system, the given information, and what you want to determine.

We can solve this problem by identifying  from the given information, and then calculating the average
acceleration directly from the equation          .
108  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     Solution                             (the negative sign indicates direction toward the west), t = 1.80
     First, identify the knowns:
     s.

     Second, find the change in velocity. Since the horse is going from zero to -15.0 m/s, its change in velocity equals its
     final velocity:

     Last, substitute the known values (  ) and solve for the unknown :

     Significance
     The negative sign for acceleration indicates that acceleration is toward the west. An acceleration of 8.33 m/s2 due
     west means the horse increases its velocity by 8.33 m/s due west each second; that is, 8.33 meters per second per
     second, which we write as 8.33 m/s2. This is truly an average acceleration, because the ride is not smooth. We see
     later that an acceleration of this magnitude would require the rider to hang on with a force nearly equal to his
     weight.

     Protons in a linear accelerator are accelerated from rest to
     acceleration of the protons?

     Instantaneous Acceleration

     Instantaneous acceleration a, or acceleration at a specific instant in time, is obtained using the same process
     discussed for instantaneous velocity. That is, we calculate the average acceleration between two points in time
     separated by and let approach zero. The result is the derivative of the velocity function v(t), which is
     instantaneous acceleration and is expressed mathematically as

                                                                                                                                                            3.9

     Thus, similar to velocity being the derivative of the position function, instantaneous acceleration is the derivative of

     the velocity function. We can show this graphically in the same way as instantaneous velocity. In Figure 3.14,

     instantaneous acceleration at time t0 is the slope of the tangent line to the velocity-versus-time graph at time t0. We

     see that average acceleration        approaches instantaneous acceleration as approaches zero. Also in part

     (a) of the figure, we see that velocity has a maximum when its slope is zero. This time corresponds to the zero of the
     acceleration function. In part (b), instantaneous acceleration at the minimum velocity is shown, which is also zero,
     since the slope of the curve is zero there, too. Thus, for a given velocity function, the zeros of the acceleration
     function give either the minimum or the maximum velocity.

approaches instantaneous acceleration at time t0. In view (a), instantaneous acceleration is shown for the point on the velocity curve at
maximum velocity. At this point, instantaneous acceleration is the slope of the tangent line, which is zero. At any other time, the slope of the

tangent line--and thus instantaneous acceleration--would not be zero. (b) Same as (a) but shown for instantaneous acceleration at

minimum velocity.

To illustrate this concept, let's look at two examples. First, a simple example is shown using Figure 3.9(b), the
velocity-versus-time graph of Example 3.4, to find acceleration graphically. This graph is depicted in Figure 3.15(a),
which is a straight line. The corresponding graph of acceleration versus time is found from the slope of velocity and
is shown in Figure 3.15(b). In this example, the velocity function is a straight line with a constant slope, thus
acceleration is a constant. In the next example, the velocity function has a more complicated functional dependence
on time.

FIGURE 3.15 (a, b) The velocity-versus-time graph is linear and has a negative constant slope (a) that is equal to acceleration, shown in (b).

If we know the functional form of velocity, v(t), we can calculate instantaneous acceleration a(t) at any time point in
the motion using Equation 3.9.

       d. Interpret the results of (c) in terms of the directions of the acceleration and velocity vectors.

     Strategy
     We find the functional form of acceleration by taking the derivative of the velocity function. Then, we calculate the
     values of instantaneous velocity and acceleration from the given functions for each. For part (d), we need to
     compare the directions of velocity and acceleration at each time.

     d. At t = 1 s, velocity                   is positive and acceleration is positive, so both velocity and acceleration are

         in the same direction. The particle is moving faster.

     At t = 2 s, velocity has increased to           , where it is maximum, which corresponds to the time when the

     acceleration is zero. We see that the maximum velocity occurs when the slope of the velocity function is zero, which

     is just the zero of the acceleration function.

     At t = 3 s, velocity is                and acceleration is negative. The particle has reduced its velocity and the

     acceleration vector is negative. The particle is slowing down.

     At t = 5 s, velocity is                and acceleration is increasingly negative. Between the times t = 3 s and t = 5

     s the particle has decreased its velocity to zero and then become negative, thus reversing its direction. The particle

     is now speeding up again, but in the opposite direction.

     We can see these results graphically in Figure 3.16.

By doing both a numerical and graphical analysis of velocity and acceleration of the particle, we can learn much
about its motion. The numerical analysis complements the graphical analysis in giving a total view of the motion.
The zero of the acceleration function corresponds to the maximum of the velocity in this example. Also in this
example, when acceleration is positive and in the same direction as velocity, velocity increases. As acceleration
tends toward zero, eventually becoming negative, the velocity reaches a maximum, after which it starts decreasing.
If we wait long enough, velocity also becomes negative, indicating a reversal of direction. A real-world example of
this type of motion is a car with a velocity that is increasing to a maximum, after which it starts slowing down, comes
to a stop, then reverses direction.

     Getting a Feel for Acceleration

     You are probably used to experiencing acceleration when you step into an elevator, or step on the gas pedal in your
     car. However, acceleration is happening to many other objects in our universe with which we don't have direct
     contact. Table 3.2 presents the acceleration of various objects. We can see the magnitudes of the accelerations
     extend over many orders of magnitude.

     In this table, we see that typical accelerations vary widely with different objects and have nothing to do with object
     size or how massive it is. Acceleration can also vary widely with time during the motion of an object. A drag racer has
     a large acceleration just after its start, but then it tapers off as the vehicle reaches a constant velocity. Its average
     acceleration can be quite different from its instantaneous acceleration at a particular time during its motion. Figure
     3.17 compares graphically average acceleration with instantaneous acceleration for two very different motions.

3.4 Motion with Constant Acceleration

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify which equations of motion are to be used to solve for unknowns.
    · Use appropriate equations of motion to solve a two-body pursuit problem.

You might guess that the greater the acceleration of, say, a car moving away from a stop sign, the greater the car's
displacement in a given time. But, we have not developed a specific equation that relates acceleration and
displacement. In this section, we look at some convenient equations for kinematic relationships, starting from the
definitions of displacement, velocity, and acceleration. We first investigate a single object in motion, called single-
body motion. Then we investigate the motion of two objects, called two-body pursuit problems.

Notation

First, let us make some simplifications in notation. Taking the initial time to be zero, as if time is measured with a

stopwatch, is a great simplification. Since elapsed time is     , taking        means that  , the final

time on the stopwatch. When initial time is taken to be zero, we use the subscript 0 to denote initial values of

position and velocity. That is, is the initial position and is the initial velocity. We put no subscripts on the final

values. That is, t is the final time, x is the final position, and v is the final velocity. This gives a simpler expression for

elapsed time,  . It also simplifies the expression for x displacement, which is now         . Also, it

simplifies the expression for change in velocity, which is now  . To summarize, using the simplified

notation, with the initial time taken to be zero,
114  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     where the subscript 0 denotes an initial value and the absence of a subscript denotes a final value in whatever
     motion is under consideration.

     We now make the important assumption that acceleration is constant. This assumption allows us to avoid using
     calculus to find instantaneous acceleration. Since acceleration is constant, the average and instantaneous
     accelerations are equal--that is,

     Thus, we can use the symbol a for acceleration at all times. Assuming acceleration to be constant does not seriously
     limit the situations we can study nor does it degrade the accuracy of our treatment. For one thing, acceleration is
     constant in a great number of situations. Furthermore, in many other situations we can describe motion accurately
     by assuming a constant acceleration equal to the average acceleration for that motion. Lastly, for motion during
     which acceleration changes drastically, such as a car accelerating to top speed and then braking to a stop, motion
     can be considered in separate parts, each of which has its own constant acceleration.

     Displacement and Position from Velocity

     To get our first two equations, we start with the definition of average velocity:

     Substituting the simplified notation for and yields

     Solving for x gives us                               3.10
     where the average velocity is                        3.11

     The equation  reflects the fact that when acceleration is constant, is just the simple average of the initial

     and final velocities. Figure 3.18 illustrates this concept graphically. In part (a) of the figure, acceleration is constant,
     with velocity increasing at a constant rate. The average velocity during the 1-h interval from 40 km/h to 80 km/h is
     60 km/h:

     In part (b), acceleration is not constant. During the 1-h interval, velocity is closer to 80 km/h than 40 km/h. Thus,
     the average velocity is greater than in part (a).

velocity is            . (b) Velocity-versus-time graph with an acceleration that changes with time. The average velocity is not

given by     , but is greater than 60 km/h.

Solving for Final Velocity from Acceleration and Time

We can derive another useful equation by manipulating the definition of acceleration:

Substituting the simplified notation for and gives us

Solving for v yields

                                                                                                                               3.12

          EXAMPLE 3.7

Calculating Final Velocity

An airplane lands with an initial velocity of 70.0 m/s and then accelerates opposite to the motion at 1.50 m/s2 for

40.0 s. What is its final velocity?

Strategy

First, we identify the knowns:                                         .

Second, we identify the unknown; in this case, it is final velocity .

Last, we determine which equation to use. To do this we figure out which kinematic equation gives the unknown in

terms of the knowns. We calculate the final velocity using Equation 3.12,              .

Solution
Substitute the known values and solve:

Figure 3.19 is a sketch that shows the acceleration and velocity vectors.
116  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     FIGURE 3.19 The airplane lands with an initial velocity of 70.0 m/s and slows to a final velocity of 10.0 m/s before heading for the terminal.
     Note the acceleration is negative because its direction is opposite to its velocity, which is positive.

     Significance
     The final velocity is much less than the initial velocity, as desired when slowing down, but is still positive (see figure).
     With jet engines, reverse thrust can be maintained long enough to stop the plane and start moving it backward,
     which is indicated by a negative final velocity, but is not the case here.

     In addition to being useful in problem solving, the equation           gives us insight into the relationships
     among velocity, acceleration, and time. We can see, for example, that

     · Final velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and how long it lasts
     · If the acceleration is zero, then the final velocity equals the initial velocity (v = v0), as expected (in other

        words, velocity is constant)
     · If a is negative, then the final velocity is less than the initial velocity

     All these observations fit our intuition. Note that it is always useful to examine basic equations in light of our
     intuition and experience to check that they do indeed describe nature accurately.

     Solving for Final Position with Constant Acceleration

     We can combine the previous equations to find a third equation that allows us to calculate the final position of an
     object experiencing constant acceleration. We start with

     Adding to each side of this equation and dividing by 2 gives

     Since  for constant acceleration, we have

     Now we substitute this expression for into the equation for displacement,  , yielding

                                                                                                                         3.13

             EXAMPLE 3.8

     Calculating Displacement of an Accelerating Object

     Dragsters can achieve an average acceleration of 26.0 m/s2. Suppose a dragster accelerates from rest at this rate
     for 5.56 s (Figure 3.20). How far does it travel in this time?

Thurmond. Photo Courtesy of U.S. Army.)

Strategy

First, let's draw a sketch (Figure 3.21). We are asked to find displacement, which is x if we take to be zero. (Think
about as the starting line of a race. It can be anywhere, but we call it zero and measure all other positions relative

to it.) We can use the equation                      when we identify , , and t from the statement of the

problem.

                                 FIGURE 3.21 Sketch of an accelerating dragster.

Solution                                                              , a is given as 26.0 m/s2 and t is given as
First, we need to identify the knowns. Starting from rest means that
5.56 s.

Second, we substitute the known values into the equation to solve for the unknown:

Since the initial position and velocity are both zero, this equation simplifies to

Substituting the identified values of a and t gives

Significance
If we convert 402 m to miles, we find that the distance covered is very close to one-quarter of a mile, the standard
distance for drag racing. So, our answer is reasonable. This is an impressive displacement to cover in only 5.56 s,
118  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     but top-notch dragsters can do a quarter mile in even less time than this. If the dragster were given an initial
     velocity, this would add another term to the distance equation. If the same acceleration and time are used in the
     equation, the distance covered would be much greater.

     What else can we learn by examining the equation                          We can see the following relationships:

     · Displacement depends on the square of the elapsed time when acceleration is not zero. In Example 3.8, the

            dragster covers only one-fourth of the total distance in the first half of the elapsed time.

     · If acceleration is zero, then initial velocity equals average velocity  , and

     Solving for Final Velocity from Distance and Acceleration

     A fourth useful equation can be obtained from another algebraic manipulation of previous equations. If we solve
                     for t, we get

     Substituting this and             into  , we get

                                                                                                          3.14

            EXAMPLE 3.9

     Calculating Final Velocity

     Calculate the final velocity of the dragster in Example 3.8 without using information about time.

     Strategy

     The equation                            is ideally suited to this task because it relates velocities, acceleration, and

     displacement, and no time information is required.

     Solution
     First, we identify the known values. We know that v0 = 0, since the dragster starts from rest. We also know that x -
     x0 = 402 m (this was the answer in Example 3.8). The average acceleration was given by a = 26.0 m/s2.

     Second, we substitute the knowns into the equation                        and solve for v:

     Thus,

     Significance

     A velocity of 145 m/s is about 522 km/h, or about 324 mi/h, but even this breakneck speed is short of the record for
     the quarter mile. Also, note that a square root has two values; we took the positive value to indicate a velocity in the
     same direction as the acceleration.

     An examination of the equation                      can produce additional insights into the general relationships
     among physical quantities:

     · The final velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and the distance over which it acts.

    · For a fixed acceleration, a car that is going twice as fast doesn't simply stop in twice the distance. It takes
        much farther to stop. (This is why we have reduced speed zones near schools.)

Putting Equations Together

In the following examples, we continue to explore one-dimensional motion, but in situations requiring slightly more
algebraic manipulation. The examples also give insight into problem-solving techniques. The note that follows is
provided for easy reference to the equations needed. Be aware that these equations are not independent. In many
situations we have two unknowns and need two equations from the set to solve for the unknowns. We need as many
equations as there are unknowns to solve a given situation.

  SUMMARY OF KINEMATIC EQUATIONS (CONSTANT A)

Before we get into the examples, let's look at some of the equations more closely to see the behavior of acceleration
at extreme values. Rearranging Equation 3.12, we have

From this we see that, for a finite time, if the difference between the initial and final velocities is small, the

acceleration is small, approaching zero in the limit that the initial and final velocities are equal. On the contrary, in

the limit  for a finite difference between the initial and final velocities, acceleration becomes infinite.

Similarly, rearranging Equation 3.14, we can express acceleration in terms of velocities and displacement:

Thus, for a finite difference between the initial and final velocities acceleration becomes infinite in the limit the
displacement approaches zero. Acceleration approaches zero in the limit the difference in initial and final velocities
approaches zero for a finite displacement.

        EXAMPLE 3.10

How Far Does a Car Go?

On dry concrete, a car can accelerate opposite to the motion at a rate of 7.00 m/s2, whereas on wet concrete it can
accelerate opposite to the motion at only 5.00 m/s2. Find the distances necessary to stop a car moving at 30.0 m/s
(about 110 km/h) on (a) dry concrete and (b) wet concrete. (c) Repeat both calculations and find the displacement
from the point where the driver sees a traffic light turn red, taking into account their reaction time of 0.500 s to get
their foot on the brake.

Strategy
First, we need to draw a sketch Figure 3.22. To determine which equations are best to use, we need to list all the
known values and identify exactly what we need to solve for.
120  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

                          FIGURE 3.22 Sample sketch to visualize acceleration opposite to the motion and stopping distance of a car.

     Solution
       a. First, we need to identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that v0 = 30.0 m/s, v = 0, and a
            = -7.00 m/s2 (a is negative because it is in a direction opposite to velocity). We take x0 to be zero. We are
            looking for displacement , or x - x0.
             Second, we identify the equation that will help us solve the problem. The best equation to use is

            This equation is best because it includes only one unknown, x. We know the values of all the other variables in
            this equation. (Other equations would allow us to solve for x, but they require us to know the stopping time, t,
             which we do not know. We could use them, but it would entail additional calculations.)
            Third, we rearrange the equation to solve for x:

             and substitute the known values:

     Thus,

     b. This part can be solved in exactly the same manner as (a). The only difference is that the acceleration is -5.00
          m/s2. The result is

     c. When the driver reacts, the stopping distance is the same as it is in (a) and (b) for dry and wet concrete. So, to

     answer this question, we need to calculate how far the car travels during the reaction time, and then add that

     to the stopping time. It is reasonable to assume the velocity remains constant during the driver's reaction

     time.

     To do this, we, again, identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that      ,

            , and                      . We take              to be zero. We are looking for  .

     Second, as before, we identify the best equation to use. In this case,  works well because the only

     unknown value is x, which is what we want to solve for.

     Third, we substitute the knowns to solve the equation:

     This means the car travels 15.0 m while the driver reacts, making the total displacements in the two cases of
     dry and wet concrete 15.0 m greater than if he reacted instantly.
     Last, we then add the displacement during the reaction time to the displacement when braking (Figure 3.23),

     and find (a) to be 64.3 m + 15.0 m = 79.3 m when dry and (b) to be 90.0 m + 15.0 m = 105 m when wet.

FIGURE 3.23 The distance necessary to stop a car varies greatly, depending on road conditions and driver reaction time. Shown here are
the braking distances for dry and wet pavement, as calculated in this example, for a car traveling initially at 30.0 m/s. Also shown are the
total distances traveled from the point when the driver first sees a light turn red, assuming a 0.500-s reaction time.

Significance
The displacements found in this example seem reasonable for stopping a fast-moving car. It should take longer to
stop a car on wet pavement than dry. It is interesting that reaction time adds significantly to the displacements, but
more important is the general approach to solving problems. We identify the knowns and the quantities to be
determined, then find an appropriate equation. If there is more than one unknown, we need as many independent
equations as there are unknowns to solve. There is often more than one way to solve a problem. The various parts of
this example can, in fact, be solved by other methods, but the solutions presented here are the shortest.

        EXAMPLE 3.11

Calculating Time

Suppose a car merges into freeway traffic on a 200-m-long ramp. If its initial velocity is 10.0 m/s and it accelerates
at 2.00 m/s2, how long does it take the car to travel the 200 m up the ramp? (Such information might be useful to a
traffic engineer.)

Strategy
First, we draw a sketch Figure 3.24. We are asked to solve for time t. As before, we identify the known quantities to
choose a convenient physical relationship (that is, an equation with one unknown, t.)

FIGURE 3.24 Sketch of a car accelerating on a freeway ramp.

Solution
Again, we identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that

                                     , and x = 200 m.

We need to solve for t. The equation  works best because the only unknown in the equation is

the variable t, for which we need to solve. From this insight we see that when we input the knowns into the equation,
we end up with a quadratic equation.
122  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     We need to rearrange the equation to solve for t, then substituting the knowns into the equation:

     We then simplify the equation. The units of meters cancel because they are in each term. We can get the units of
     seconds to cancel by taking t = t s, where t is the magnitude of time and s is the unit. Doing so leaves

     We then use the quadratic formula to solve for t,

     which yields two solutions: t = 10.0 and t = -20.0. A negative value for time is unreasonable, since it would mean
     the event happened 20 s before the motion began. We can discard that solution. Thus,

     Significance
     Whenever an equation contains an unknown squared, there are two solutions. In some problems both solutions are
     meaningful; in others, only one solution is reasonable. The 10.0-s answer seems reasonable for a typical freeway
     on-ramp.

     Acceleration of a Spaceship

     A spaceship has left Earth's orbit and is on its way to the Moon. It accelerates at 20 m/s2 for 2 min and covers a

     distance of 1000 km. What are the initial and final velocities of the spaceship?

     Strategy

     We are asked to find the initial and final velocities of the spaceship. Looking at the kinematic equations, we see that
     one equation will not give the answer. We must use one kinematic equation to solve for one of the velocities and
     substitute it into another kinematic equation to get the second velocity. Thus, we solve two of the kinematic

Significance
There are six variables in displacement, time, velocity, and acceleration that describe motion in one dimension. The
initial conditions of a given problem can be many combinations of these variables. Because of this diversity,
solutions may not be as easy as simple substitutions into one of the equations. This example illustrates that
solutions to kinematics may require solving two simultaneous kinematic equations.

With the basics of kinematics established, we can go on to many other interesting examples and applications. In the
process of developing kinematics, we have also glimpsed a general approach to problem solving that produces both
correct answers and insights into physical relationships. The next level of complexity in our kinematics problems
involves the motion of two interrelated bodies, called two-body pursuit problems.

Two-Body Pursuit Problems

Up until this point we have looked at examples of motion involving a single body. Even for the problem with two cars
and the stopping distances on wet and dry roads, we divided this problem into two separate problems to find the
answers. In a two-body pursuit problem, the motions of the objects are coupled--meaning, the unknown we seek
depends on the motion of both objects. To solve these problems we write the equations of motion for each object
and then solve them simultaneously to find the unknown. This is illustrated in Figure 3.25.

FIGURE 3.25 A two-body pursuit scenario where car 2 has a constant velocity and car 1 is behind with a constant acceleration. Car 1
catches up with car 2 at a later time.

The time and distance required for car 1 to catch car 2 depends on the initial distance car 1 is from car 2 as well as
the velocities of both cars and the acceleration of car 1. The kinematic equations describing the motion of both cars
must be solved to find these unknowns.

Consider the following example.

EXAMPLE 3.13

Cheetah Catching a Gazelle

A cheetah waits in hiding behind a bush. The cheetah spots a gazelle running past at 10 m/s. At the instant the
gazelle passes the cheetah, the cheetah accelerates from rest at 4 m/s2 to catch the gazelle. (a) How long does it
take the cheetah to catch the gazelle? (b) What is the displacement of the gazelle and cheetah?

Strategy

We use the set of equations for constant acceleration to solve this problem. Since there are two objects in motion,

we have separate equations of motion describing each animal. But what links the equations is a common parameter

that has the same value for each animal. If we look at the problem closely, it is clear the common parameter to each

animal is their position x at a later time t. Since they both start at     , their displacements are the same at a later

time t, when the cheetah catches up with the gazelle. If we pick the equation of motion that solves for the

displacement for each animal, we can then set the equations equal to each other and solve for the unknown, which

is time.

Solution

a. Equation for the gazelle: The gazelle has a constant velocity, which is its average velocity, since it is not

accelerating. Therefore, we use Equation 3.10 with                      :
124  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     Equation for the cheetah: The cheetah is accelerating from rest, so we use Equation 3.13 with  and

     :

     Now we have an equation of motion for each animal with a common parameter, which can be eliminated to
     find the solution. In this case, we solve for t:

             The gazelle has a constant velocity of 10 m/s, which is its average velocity. The acceleration of the cheetah is
            4 m/s2. Evaluating t, the time for the cheetah to reach the gazelle, we have

       b. To get the displacement, we use either the equation of motion for the cheetah or the gazelle, since they should
             both give the same answer.
             Displacement of the cheetah:

             Displacement of the gazelle:

             We see that both displacements are equal, as expected.
     Significance
     It is important to analyze the motion of each object and to use the appropriate kinematic equations to describe the
     individual motion. It is also important to have a good visual perspective of the two-body pursuit problem to see the
     common parameter that links the motion of both objects.

     3.5 Free Fall

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Use the kinematic equations with the variables y and g to analyze free-fall motion.
         · Describe how the values of the position, velocity, and acceleration change during a free fall.
         · Solve for the position, velocity, and acceleration as functions of time when an object is in a free fall.
     An interesting application of Equation 3.4 through Equation 3.14 is called free fall, which describes the motion of an
     object falling in a gravitational field, such as near the surface of Earth or other celestial objects of planetary size.
     Let's assume the body is falling in a straight line perpendicular to the surface, so its motion is one-dimensional. For
     example, we can estimate the depth of a vertical mine shaft by dropping a rock into it and listening for the rock to hit
     the bottom. But "falling," in the context of free fall, does not necessarily imply the body is moving from a greater
     height to a lesser height. If a ball is thrown upward, the equations of free fall apply equally to its ascent as well as its
     descent.

Gravity

The most remarkable and unexpected fact about falling objects is that if air resistance and friction are negligible,
then in a given location all objects fall toward the center of Earth with the same constant acceleration, independent
of their mass. This experimentally determined fact is unexpected because we are so accustomed to the effects of air
resistance and friction that we expect light objects to fall slower than heavy ones. Until Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)
proved otherwise, people believed that a heavier object has a greater acceleration in a free fall. We now know this is
not the case. In the absence of air resistance, heavy objects arrive at the ground at the same time as lighter objects
when dropped from the same height Figure 3.26.

FIGURE 3.26 A hammer and a feather fall with the same constant acceleration if air resistance is negligible. This is a general characteristic
of gravity not unique to Earth, as astronaut David R. Scott demonstrated in 1971 on the Moon, where the acceleration from gravity is only
1.67 m/s2 and there is no atmosphere.

In the real world, air resistance can cause a lighter object to fall slower than a heavier object of the same size. A
tennis ball reaches the ground after a baseball dropped at the same time. (It might be difficult to observe the
difference if the height is not large.) Air resistance opposes the motion of an object through the air, and friction
between objects--such as between clothes and a laundry chute or between a stone and a pool into which it is
dropped--also opposes motion between them.

For the ideal situations of these first few chapters, an object falling without air resistance or friction is defined to be
in free fall. The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth. The acceleration of free-falling
objects is therefore called acceleration due to gravity. Acceleration due to gravity is constant, which means we can
apply the kinematic equations to any falling object where air resistance and friction are negligible. This opens to us a
broad class of interesting situations.

Acceleration due to gravity is so important that its magnitude is given its own symbol, g. It is constant at any given
location on Earth and has the average value

Although g varies from 9.78 m/s2 to 9.83 m/s2, depending on latitude, altitude, underlying geological formations,
and local topography, let's use an average value of 9.8 m/s2 rounded to two significant figures in this text unless

specified otherwise. Neglecting these effects on the value of g as a result of position on Earth's surface, as well as

effects resulting from Earth's rotation, we take the direction of acceleration due to gravity to be downward (toward

the center of Earth). In fact, its direction defines what we call vertical. Note that whether acceleration a in the

kinematic equations has the value +g or -g depends on how we define our coordinate system. If we define the

upward direction as positive, then  and if we define the downward direction as positive, then

.
126  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     One-Dimensional Motion Involving Gravity

     The best way to see the basic features of motion involving gravity is to start with the simplest situations and then
     progress toward more complex ones. So, we start by considering straight up-and-down motion with no air
     resistance or friction. These assumptions mean the velocity (if there is any) is vertical. If an object is dropped, we
     know the initial velocity is zero when in free fall. When the object has left contact with whatever held or threw it, the
     object is in free fall. When the object is thrown, it has the same initial speed in free fall as it did before it was
     released. When the object comes in contact with the ground or any other object, it is no longer in free fall and its
     acceleration of g is no longer valid. Under these circumstances, the motion is one-dimensional and has constant
     acceleration of magnitude g. We represent vertical displacement with the symbol y.

     KINEMATIC EQUATIONS FOR OBJECTS IN FREE FALL

     We assume here that acceleration equals -g (with the positive direction upward).  3.15

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Free Fall

       1. Decide on the sign of the acceleration of gravity. In Equation 3.15 through Equation 3.17, acceleration g is
             negative, which says the positive direction is upward and the negative direction is downward. In some
            problems, it may be useful to have acceleration g as positive, indicating the positive direction is downward.

       3. Record the knowns and unknowns from the problem description. This helps devise a strategy for selecting the

          FIGURE 3.27 The positions and velocities at 1-s intervals of a ball thrown downward from a tall building at 4.9 m/s.

Strategy

Choose the origin at the top of the building with the positive direction upward and the negative direction downward.

To find the time when the position is -98 m, we use Equation 3.16, with                                                         .

Solution

a. Substitute the given values into the equation:

This simplifies to

This is a quadratic equation with roots            . The positive root is the one we are interested

in, since time      is the time when the ball is released at the top of the building. (The time

represents the fact that a ball thrown upward from the ground would have been in the air for 5.0 s when it

passed by the top of the building moving downward at 4.9 m/s.)

b. Using Equation 3.15, we have

Significance

For situations when two roots are obtained from a quadratic equation in the time variable, we must look at the

physical significance of both roots to determine which is correct. Since  corresponds to the time when the ball

was released, the negative root would correspond to a time before the ball was released, which is not physically

meaningful. When the ball hits the ground, its velocity is not immediately zero, but as soon as the ball interacts with

the ground, its acceleration is not g and it accelerates with a different value over a short time to zero velocity. This

problem shows how important it is to establish the correct coordinate system and to keep the signs of g in the

kinematic equations consistent.

     b. At the maximum height,            . With  , Equation 3.17 gives

     d. The acceleration is 9.8 m/s2 everywhere, even when the velocity is zero at the top of the path. Although the

     velocity is zero at the top, it is changing at the rate of 9.8 m/s2 downward.

state of free fall.

               FIGURE 3.29 A rocket releases its booster at a given height and velocity. How high and how fast does the booster go?

Strategy
We need to select the coordinate system for the acceleration of gravity, which we take as negative downward. We
are given the initial velocity of the booster and its height. We consider the point of release as the origin. We know the
velocity is zero at the maximum position within the acceleration interval; thus, the velocity of the booster is zero at
its maximum height, so we can use this information as well. From these observations, we use Equation 3.17, which
gives us the maximum height of the booster. We also use Equation 3.17 to give the velocity at 6.0 km. The initial
velocity of the booster is 200.0 m/s.
130  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     Solution                                 . With             , we can solve for y:
       a. From Equation 3.17,

     This solution gives the maximum height of the booster in our coordinate system, which has its origin at the

     point of release, so the maximum height of the booster is roughly 7.0 km.

     b. An altitude of 6.0 km corresponds to                     in the coordinate system we are using. The other initial

     conditions are                           .

     We have, from Equation 3.17,

     Significance

     We have both a positive and negative solution in (b). Since our coordinate system has the positive direction upward,
     the +142.8 m/s corresponds to a positive upward velocity at 6000 m during the upward leg of the trajectory of the
     booster. The value v = -142.8 m/s corresponds to the velocity at 6000 m on the downward leg. This example is also
     important in that an object is given an initial velocity at the origin of our coordinate system, but the origin is at an
     altitude above the surface of Earth, which must be taken into account when forming the solution.

         · Find the functional form of position versus time given the velocity function.

     This section assumes you have enough background in calculus to be familiar with integration. In Instantaneous
     Velocity and Speed and Average and Instantaneous Acceleration we introduced the kinematic functions of velocity
     and acceleration using the derivative. By taking the derivative of the position function we found the velocity function,

where C1 is a constant of integration. Since  , the velocity is given by

                                                                                   3.18

Similarly, the time derivative of the position function is the velocity function,

Thus, we can use the same mathematical manipulations we just used and find

where C2 is a second constant of integration.

We can derive the kinematic equations for a constant acceleration using these integrals. With a(t) = a a constant,
and doing the integration in Equation 3.18, we find

If the initial velocity is v(0) = v0, then
Then, C1 = v0 and
which is Equation 3.12. Substituting this expression into Equation 3.19 gives

Doing the integration, we find

If x(0) = x0, we have
so, C2 = x0. Substituting back into the equation for x(t), we finally have

which is Equation 3.13.

132  3 · Motion Along a Straight Line

     Strategy
     (a) To get the velocity function we must integrate and use initial conditions to find the constant of integration. (b) We
     set the velocity function equal to zero and solve for t. (c) Similarly, we must integrate to find the position function
     and use initial conditions to find the constant of integration. (d) Since the initial position is taken to be zero, we only
     have to evaluate the position function at the time when the velocity is zero.

     Solution
     We take t = 0 to be the time when the boat starts to accelerate opposite to the motion.

       a. From the functional form of the acceleration we can solve Equation 3.18 to get v(t):

         At t = 0 we have v(0) = 5.0 m/s = 0 + C1, so C1 = 5.0 m/s or  .

     c. Solve Equation 3.19:

          At t = 0, we set x(0) = 0 = x0, since we are only interested in the displacement from when the boat starts to
          accelerate opposite to the motion. We have

          Therefore, the equation for the position is

     d. Since the initial position is taken to be zero, we only have to evaluate the position function at the time when
          the velocity is zero. This occurs at t = 6.3 s. Therefore, the displacement is

Significance

The acceleration function is linear in time so the integration involves simple polynomials. In Figure 3.30, we see that
if we extend the solution beyond the point when the velocity is zero, the velocity becomes negative and the boat
reverses direction. This tells us that solutions can give us information outside our immediate interest and we should

CHAPTER OUTLINE
4.1 Displacement and Velocity Vectors
4.2 Acceleration Vector
4.3 Projectile Motion
4.4 Uniform and Nonuniform Circular Motion
4.5 Relative Motion in One and Two Dimensions

INTRODUCTION To give a complete description of kinematics, we must explore motion in two and three
dimensions. After all, most objects in our universe do not move in straight lines; rather, they follow curved paths.
From kicked footballs to the flight paths of birds to the orbital motions of celestial bodies and down to the flow of
blood plasma in your veins, most motion follows curved trajectories.
Fortunately, the treatment of motion in one dimension in the previous chapter has given us a foundation on which to
build, as the concepts of position, displacement, velocity, and acceleration defined in one dimension can be
expanded to two and three dimensions. Consider the Red Arrows, also known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic team
of the United Kingdom. Each jet follows a unique curved trajectory in three-dimensional airspace, as well as has a
unique velocity and acceleration. Thus, to describe the motion of any of the jets accurately, we must assign to each
jet a unique position vector in three dimensions as well as a unique velocity and acceleration vector. We can apply
the same basic equations for displacement, velocity, and acceleration we derived in Motion Along a Straight Line to
describe the motion of the jets in two and three dimensions, but with some modifications--in particular, the
inclusion of vectors.
In this chapter we also explore two special types of motion in two dimensions: projectile motion and circular
motion. Last, we conclude with a discussion of relative motion. In the chapter-opening picture, each jet has a
relative motion with respect to any other jet in the group or to the people observing the air show on the ground.

     4.1 Displacement and Velocity Vectors

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Calculate position vectors in a multidimensional displacement problem.
         · Solve for the displacement in two or three dimensions.
         · Calculate the velocity vector given the position vector as a function of time.
         · Calculate the average velocity in multiple dimensions.

     Displacement and velocity in two or three dimensions are straightforward extensions of the one-dimensional
     definitions. However, now they are vector quantities, so calculations with them have to follow the rules of vector
     algebra, not scalar algebra.

     Displacement Vector

     To describe motion in two and three dimensions, we must first establish a coordinate system and a convention for
     the axes. We generally use the coordinates x, y, and z to locate a particle at point P(x, y, z) in three dimensions. If the
     particle is moving, the variables x, y, and z are functions of time (t):

                                                                                                                                                            4.1

     The position vector from the origin of the coordinate system to point P is  In unit vector notation, introduced in
     Coordinate Systems and Components of a Vector, is                                                                        4.2

     Figure 4.2 shows the coordinate system and the vector to point P, where a particle could be located at a particular
     time t. Note the orientation of the x, y, and z axes. This orientation is called a right-handed coordinate system
     (Coordinate Systems and Components of a Vector) and it is used throughout the chapter.

     FIGURE 4.2 A three-dimensional coordinate system with a particle at position P(x(t), y(t), z(t)).

     With our definition of the position of a particle in three-dimensional space, we can formulate the three-dimensional

     displacement. Figure 4.3 shows a particle at time located at with position vector  At a later time the

     particle is located at  with position vector  . The displacement vector is found by subtracting    from

          

                                                                                                        4.3

     Vector addition is discussed in Vectors. Note that this is the same operation we did in one dimension, but now the
     vectors are in three-dimensional space.

The following examples illustrate the concept of displacement in multiple dimensions.

EXAMPLE 4.1

Polar Orbiting Satellite

A satellite is in a circular polar orbit around Earth at an altitude of 400 km--meaning, it passes directly overhead at

the North and South Poles. What is the magnitude and direction of the displacement vector from when it is directly

over the North Pole to when it is at  latitude?

Strategy
We make a picture of the problem to visualize the solution graphically. This will aid in our understanding of the
displacement. We then use unit vectors to solve for the displacement.

Solution

Figure 4.4 shows the surface of Earth and a circle that represents the orbit of the satellite. Although satellites are
moving in three-dimensional space, they follow trajectories of ellipses, which can be graphed in two dimensions.
The position vectors are drawn from the center of Earth, which we take to be the origin of the coordinate system,
with the y-axis as north and the x-axis as east. The vector between them is the displacement of the satellite. We
take the radius of Earth as 6370 km, so the length of each position vector is 6770 km.
148  4 · Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

     FIGURE 4.4 Two position vectors are drawn from the center of Earth, which is the origin of the coordinate system, with the y-axis as north
     and the x-axis as east. The vector between them is the displacement of the satellite.

     In unit vector notation, the position vectors are

     Evaluating the sine and cosine, we have

     Now we can find , the displacement of the satellite:

     The magnitude of the displacement is                  The angle the displacement
     makes with the x-axis is

     Significance

     Plotting the displacement gives information and meaning to the unit vector solution to the problem. When plotting
     the displacement, we need to include its components as well as its magnitude and the angle it makes with a chosen
     axis--in this case, the x-axis (Figure 4.5).

                                            FIGURE 4.5 Displacement vector with components, angle, and magnitude.

Note that the satellite took a curved path along its circular orbit to get from its initial position to its final position in
this example. It also could have traveled 4787 km east, then 11,557 km south to arrive at the same location. Both of
these paths are longer than the length of the displacement vector. In fact, the displacement vector gives the
shortest path between two points in one, two, or three dimensions.
Many applications in physics can have a series of displacements, as discussed in the previous chapter. The total
displacement is the sum of the individual displacements, only this time, we need to be careful, because we are
adding vectors. We illustrate this concept with an example of Brownian motion.

        EXAMPLE 4.2
Brownian Motion

Brownian motion is a chaotic random motion of particles suspended in a fluid, resulting from collisions with the
molecules of the fluid. This motion is three-dimensional. The displacements in numerical order of a particle
undergoing Brownian motion could look like the following, in micrometers (Figure 4.6):

What is the total displacement of the particle from the origin?
150  4 · Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

          FIGURE 4.6 Trajectory of a particle undergoing random displacements of Brownian motion. The total displacement is shown in red.

     Solution
     We form the sum of the displacements and add them as vectors:

     To complete the solution, we express the displacement as a magnitude and direction,

     with respect to the x-axis in the xz-plane.
     Significance
     From the figure we can see the magnitude of the total displacement is less than the sum of the magnitudes of the
     individual displacements.

     Velocity Vector

     In the previous chapter we found the instantaneous velocity by calculating the derivative of the position function
     with respect to time. We can do the same operation in two and three dimensions, but we use vectors. The
     instantaneous velocity vector is now

                                                                                                                                                            4.4

     Let's look at the relative orientation of the position vector and velocity vector graphically. In Figure 4.7 we show the

     vectors and  which give the position of a particle moving along a path represented by the gray line. As

     goes to zero, the velocity vector, given by Equation 4.4, becomes tangent to the path of the particle at time t.

If only the average velocity is of concern, we have the vector equivalent of the one-dimensional average velocity for
two and three dimensions:

                                                                                                                                                       4.7

     being linear. This need not be the case in general. In fact, most of the time, instantaneous and average velocities are
     not the same.

     The position function of a particle is  (a) What is the instantaneous velocity at t = 3 s? (b) Is the

     average velocity between 2 s and 4 s equal to the instantaneous velocity at t = 3 s?

     The Independence of Perpendicular Motions

     When we look at the three-dimensional equations for position and velocity written in unit vector notation, Equation
     4.2 and Equation 4.5, we see the components of these equations are separate and unique functions of time that do
     not depend on one another. Motion along the x direction has no part of its motion along the y and z directions, and
     similarly for the other two coordinate axes. Thus, the motion of an object in two or three dimensions can be divided
     into separate, independent motions along the perpendicular axes of the coordinate system in which the motion
     takes place.

     To illustrate this concept with respect to displacement, consider a woman walking from point A to point B in a city
     with square blocks. The woman taking the path from A to B may walk east for so many blocks and then north (two
     perpendicular directions) for another set of blocks to arrive at B. How far she walks east is affected only by her
     motion eastward. Similarly, how far she walks north is affected only by her motion northward.

       INDEPENDENCE OF MOTION

       In the kinematic description of motion, we are able to treat the horizontal and vertical components of motion
       separately. In many cases, motion in the horizontal direction does not affect motion in the vertical direction, and
       vice versa.

     An example illustrating the independence of vertical and horizontal motions is given by two baseballs. One baseball
     is dropped from rest. At the same instant, another is thrown horizontally from the same height and it follows a
     curved path. A stroboscope captures the positions of the balls at fixed time intervals as they fall (Figure 4.8).

FIGURE 4.8 A diagram of the motions of two identical balls: one falls from rest and the other has an initial horizontal velocity. Each
subsequent position is an equal time interval. Arrows represent the horizontal and vertical velocities at each position. The ball on the right
has an initial horizontal velocity whereas the ball on the left has no horizontal velocity. Despite the difference in horizontal velocities, the
vertical velocities and positions are identical for both balls, which shows the vertical and horizontal motions are independent.

It is remarkable that for each flash of the strobe, the vertical positions of the two balls are the same. This similarity
implies vertical motion is independent of whether the ball is moving horizontally. (Assuming no air resistance, the
vertical motion of a falling object is influenced by gravity only, not by any horizontal forces.) Careful examination of
the ball thrown horizontally shows it travels the same horizontal distance between flashes. This is because there are
no additional forces on the ball in the horizontal direction after it is thrown. This result means horizontal velocity is
constant and is affected neither by vertical motion nor by gravity (which is vertical). Note this case is true for ideal
conditions only. In the real world, air resistance affects the speed of the balls in both directions.

The two-dimensional curved path of the horizontally thrown ball is composed of two independent one-dimensional
motions (horizontal and vertical). The key to analyzing such motion, called projectile motion, is to resolve it into
motions along perpendicular directions. Resolving two-dimensional motion into perpendicular components is
possible because the components are independent.

4.2 Acceleration Vector

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Calculate the acceleration vector given the velocity function in unit vector notation.
    · Describe the motion of a particle with a constant acceleration in three dimensions.
    · Use the one-dimensional motion equations along perpendicular axes to solve a problem in two or three

        dimensions with a constant acceleration.
    · Express the acceleration in unit vector notation.

Instantaneous Acceleration

In addition to obtaining the displacement and velocity vectors of an object in motion, we often want to know its
acceleration vector at any point in time along its trajectory. This acceleration vector is the instantaneous
acceleration and it can be obtained from the derivative with respect to time of the velocity function, as we have seen
in a previous chapter. The only difference in two or three dimensions is that these are now vector quantities. Taking
the derivative with respect to time we find

                                                 4.9

     Also, since the velocity is the derivative of the position function, we can write the acceleration in terms of the second
     derivative of the position function:

                                                                                                                                                          4.10

     the acceleration is

     Significance
     In this example we find that acceleration has a time dependence and is changing throughout the motion. Let's
     consider a different velocity function for the particle.

     Strategy

     We can gain some insight into the problem by looking at the position function. It is linear in y and z, so we know the
     acceleration in these directions is zero when we take the second derivative. Also, note that the position in the x
     direction is zero for t = 0 s and t = 10 s.

     Solution
     (a) Taking the derivative with respect to time of the position function, we find

The acceleration vector is a constant in the negative x-direction.

(c) The trajectory of the particle can be seen in Figure 4.9. Let's look in the y and z directions first. The particle's
position increases steadily as a function of time with a constant velocity in these directions. In the x direction,
however, the particle follows a path in positive x until t = 5 s, when it reverses direction. We know this from looking
at the velocity function, which becomes zero at this time and negative thereafter. We also know this because the
acceleration is negative and constant--meaning, the particle is accelerating in the opposite direction. The particle's
position reaches 25 m, where it then reverses direction and begins to accelerate in the negative x direction. The
position reaches zero at t = 10 s.

FIGURE 4.9 The particle starts at point (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) with position vector  as shown with red stars. The projection of the trajectory

onto the xy-plane is shown with blue dots. The values of y and z increase linearly as a function of time, whereas x has a turning point at t = 5

s and 25 m, when it reverses direction. At this point, the x component of the velocity becomes negative. At t = 10 s, the particle is back to 0

m in the x direction.

Significance
By graphing the trajectory of the particle, we can better understand its motion, given by the numerical results of the
kinematic equations.

be said about the functional form of the velocity function?

Constant Acceleration

Multidimensional motion with constant acceleration can be treated the same way as shown in the previous chapter
for one-dimensional motion. Earlier we showed that three-dimensional motion is equivalent to three one-
dimensional motions, each along an axis perpendicular to the others. To develop the relevant equations in each
direction, let's consider the two-dimensional problem of a particle moving in the xy plane with constant

     Each component of the motion has a separate set of equations similar to Equation 3.10-Equation 3.14 of the
     previous chapter on one-dimensional motion. We show only the equations for position and velocity in the x- and

FIGURE 4.10 A skier has an acceleration of  down a slope of The origin of the coordinate system is at the ski lodge.

Strategy

Since we are evaluating the components of the motion equations in the x and y directions, we need to find the
components of the acceleration and put them into the kinematic equations. The components of the acceleration are
found by referring to the coordinate system in Figure 4.10. Then, by inserting the components of the initial position
and velocity into the motion equations, we can solve for her position and velocity at a later time t.

Solution

(a) The origin of the coordinate system is at the top of the hill with y-axis vertically upward and the x-axis horizontal.
By looking at the trajectory of the skier, the x-component of the acceleration is positive and the y-component is
negative. Since the angle is down the slope, we find

Inserting the initial position and velocity into Equation 4.12 and Equation 4.13 for x, we have

For y, we have

(b) Now that we have the equations of motion for x and y as functions of time, we can evaluate them at t = 10.0 s:
158  4 · Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

     The position and velocity at t = 10.0 s are, finally,

     The magnitude of the velocity of the skier at 10.0 s is 25 m/s, which is 60 mi/h.

     Significance
     It is useful to know that, given the initial conditions of position, velocity, and acceleration of an object, we can find
     the position, velocity, and acceleration at any later time.

     With Equation 4.8 through Equation 4.10 we have completed the set of expressions for the position, velocity, and
     acceleration of an object moving in two or three dimensions. If the trajectories of the objects look something like the
     "Red Arrows" in the opening picture for the chapter, then the expressions for the position, velocity, and acceleration
     can be quite complicated. In the sections to follow we examine two special cases of motion in two and three
     dimensions by looking at projectile motion and circular motion.

     4.3 Projectile Motion

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Use one-dimensional motion in perpendicular directions to analyze projectile motion.
         · Calculate the range, time of flight, and maximum height of a projectile that is launched and impacts a flat,

             horizontal surface.
         · Find the time of flight and impact velocity of a projectile that lands at a different height from that of

             launch.
         · Calculate the trajectory of a projectile.

     Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject only to acceleration as a result
     of gravity. The applications of projectile motion in physics and engineering are numerous. Some examples include
     meteors as they enter Earth's atmosphere, fireworks, and the motion of any ball in sports. Such objects are called
     projectiles and their path is called a trajectory. The motion of falling objects as discussed in Motion Along a Straight
     Line is a simple one-dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement. In this section,
     we consider two-dimensional projectile motion, and our treatment neglects the effects of air resistance.

     The most important fact to remember here is that motions along perpendicular axes are independent and thus can
     be analyzed separately. We discussed this fact in Displacement and Velocity Vectors, where we saw that vertical and
     horizontal motions are independent. The key to analyzing two-dimensional projectile motion is to break it into two
     motions: one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical. (This choice of axes is the most sensible
     because acceleration resulting from gravity is vertical; thus, there is no acceleration along the horizontal axis when
     air resistance is negligible.) As is customary, we call the horizontal axis the x-axis and the vertical axis the y-axis. It
     is not required that we use this choice of axes; it is simply convenient in the case of gravitational acceleration. In
     other cases we may choose a different set of axes. Figure 4.11 illustrates the notation for displacement, where we
     define to be the total displacement, and and are its component vectors along the horizontal and vertical axes,
     respectively. The magnitudes of these vectors are s, x, and y.

FIGURE 4.11 The total displacement s of a soccer ball at a point along its path. The vector has components and along the horizontal
and vertical axes. Its magnitude is s and it makes an angle  with the horizontal.

To describe projectile motion completely, we must include velocity and acceleration, as well as displacement. We
must find their components along the x- and y-axes. Let's assume all forces except gravity (such as air resistance
and friction, for example) are negligible. Defining the positive direction to be upward, the components of
acceleration are then very simple:

Because gravity is vertical,     If   this means the initial velocity in the x direction is equal to the final

velocity in the x direction, or      With these conditions on acceleration and velocity, we can write the

kinematic Equation 4.11 through Equation 4.18 for motion in a uniform gravitational field, including the rest of the

kinematic equations for a constant acceleration from Motion with Constant Acceleration. The kinematic equations

for motion in a uniform gravitational field become kinematic equations with

Using this set of equations, we can analyze projectile motion, keeping in mind some important points.

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Projectile Motion

1. Resolve the motion into horizontal and vertical components along the x- and y-axes. The magnitudes of the

components of displacement along these axes are x and y. The magnitudes of the components of velocity

are                                  where v is the magnitude of the velocity and  is its direction relative to the

horizontal, as shown in Figure 4.12.
160  4 · Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

     2. Treat the motion as two independent one-dimensional motions: one horizontal and the other vertical. Use the
          kinematic equations for horizontal and vertical motion presented earlier.

     3. Solve for the unknowns in the two separate motions: one horizontal and one vertical. Note that the only
          common variable between the motions is time t. The problem-solving procedures here are the same as those
          for one-dimensional kinematics and are illustrated in the following solved examples.

     4. Recombine quantities in the horizontal and vertical directions to find the total displacement and velocity
          Solve for the magnitude and direction of the displacement and velocity using

     where  is the direction of the displacement

     vertical and horizontal axes. (b) The horizontal motion is simple, because   and is a constant. (c) The velocity in the vertical

     direction begins to decrease as the object rises. At its highest point, the vertical velocity is zero. As the object falls toward Earth again, the

     vertical velocity increases again in magnitude but points in the opposite direction to the initial vertical velocity. (d) The x and y motions are

     recombined to give the total velocity at any given point on the trajectory.

FIGURE 4.13 The trajectory of a fireworks shell. The fuse is set to explode the shell at the highest point in its trajectory, which is found to be

Strategy

The motion can be broken into horizontal and vertical motions in which     and             We can then define

and to be zero and solve for the desired quantities.

Solution

(a) By "height" we mean the altitude or vertical position y above the starting point. The highest point in any

trajectory, called the apex, is reached when  Since we know the initial and final velocities, as well as the

initial position, we use the following equation to find y:

Because and are both zero, the equation simplifies to

Solving for y gives

Now we must find the component of the initial velocity in the y direction. It is given by                       where

is the initial velocity of 70.0 m/s and       is the initial angle. Thus,

and y is

Thus, we have

Note that because up is positive, the initial vertical velocity is positive, as is the maximum height, but the
acceleration resulting from gravity is negative. Note also that the maximum height depends only on the vertical
component of the initial velocity, so that any projectile with a 67.6-m/s initial vertical component of velocity reaches
a maximum height of 233 m (neglecting air resistance). The numbers in this example are reasonable for large
fireworks displays, the shells of which do reach such heights before exploding. In practice, air resistance is not
completely negligible, so the initial velocity would have to be somewhat larger than that given to reach the same
height.
162  4 · Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

     (b) As in many physics problems, there is more than one way to solve for the time the projectile reaches its highest

     point. In this case, the easiest method is to use                Because           at the apex, this equation reduces

     to simply

     or

     This time is also reasonable for large fireworks. If you are able to see the launch of fireworks, notice that several

     seconds pass before the shell explodes. Another way of finding the time is by using                           This is

     left for you as an exercise to complete.

     (c) Because air resistance is negligible,     and the horizontal velocity is constant, as discussed earlier. The

     horizontal displacement is the horizontal velocity multiplied by time as given by    where is equal to

     zero. Thus,

     where is the x-component of the velocity, which is given by

     Time t for both motions is the same, so x is

     Horizontal motion is a constant velocity in the absence of air resistance. The horizontal displacement found here
     could be useful in keeping the fireworks fragments from falling on spectators. When the shell explodes, air
     resistance has a major effect, and many fragments land directly below.

     (d) The horizontal and vertical components of the displacement were just calculated, so all that is needed here is to
     find the magnitude and direction of the displacement at the highest point:

     Note that the angle for the displacement vector is less than the initial angle of launch. To see why this is, review
     Figure 4.11, which shows the curvature of the trajectory toward the ground level.

     When solving Example 4.7(a), the expression we found for y is valid for any projectile motion when air resistance is
     negligible. Call the maximum height y = h. Then,

     This equation defines the maximum height of a projectile above its launch position and it depends only on the
     vertical component of the initial velocity.

        EXAMPLE 4.8

Calculating Projectile Motion: Tennis Player

A tennis player wins a match at Arthur Ashe stadium and hits a ball into the stands at 30 m/s and at an angle
above the horizontal (Figure 4.14). On its way down, the ball is caught by a spectator 10 m above the point where
the ball was hit. (a) Calculate the time it takes the tennis ball to reach the spectator. (b) What are the magnitude and
direction of the ball's velocity at impact?

Strategy
Again, resolving this two-dimensional motion into two independent one-dimensional motions allows us to solve for
the desired quantities. The time a projectile is in the air is governed by its vertical motion alone. Thus, we solve for t
first. While the ball is rising and falling vertically, the horizontal motion continues at a constant velocity. This
example asks for the final velocity. Thus, we recombine the vertical and horizontal results to obtain at final time t,
determined in the first part of the example.
Solution
(a) While the ball is in the air, it rises and then falls to a final position 10.0 m higher than its starting altitude. We can
find the time for this by using Equation 4.22:

If we take the initial position to be zero, then the final position is y = 10 m. The initial vertical velocity is the
vertical component of the initial velocity:

Substituting into Equation 4.22 for y gives us

Rearranging terms gives a quadratic equation in t:

Use of the quadratic formula yields t = 3.79 s and t = 0.54 s. Since the ball is at a height of 10 m at two times during
its trajectory--once on the way up and once on the way down--we take the longer solution for the time it takes the
ball to reach the spectator:
164  4 · Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

     The time for projectile motion is determined completely by the vertical motion. Thus, any projectile that has an
     initial vertical velocity of 21.2 m/s and lands 10.0 m above its starting altitude spends 3.79 s in the air.

     (b) We can find the final horizontal and vertical velocities and with the use of the result from (a). Then, we can
     combine them to find the magnitude of the total velocity vector and the angle it makes with the horizontal. Since

         is constant, we can solve for it at any horizontal location. We choose the starting point because we know both the
     initial velocity and the initial angle. Therefore,

     The final vertical velocity is given by Equation 4.21:

     Since was found in part (a) to be 21.2 m/s, we have

     The magnitude of the final velocity is

     The direction is found using the inverse tangent:

     Significance

     (a) As mentioned earlier, the time for projectile motion is determined completely by the vertical motion. Thus, any

     projectile that has an initial vertical velocity of 21.2 m/s and lands 10.0 m above its starting altitude spends 3.79 s in

     the air. (b) The negative angle means the velocity is   below the horizontal at the point of impact. This result is

     consistent with the fact that the ball is impacting at a point on the other side of the apex of the trajectory and

     therefore has a negative y component of the velocity. The magnitude of the velocity is less than the magnitude of the

     initial velocity we expect since it is impacting 10.0 m above the launch elevation.

     Time of Flight, Trajectory, and Range

     Of interest are the time of flight, trajectory, and range for a projectile launched on a flat horizontal surface and
     impacting on the same surface. In this case, kinematic equations give useful expressions for these quantities, which
     are derived in the following sections.

     Time of flight
     We can solve for the time of flight of a projectile that is both launched and impacts on a flat horizontal surface by
     performing some manipulations of the kinematic equations. We note the position and displacement in y must be
     zero at launch and at impact on an even surface. Thus, we set the displacement in y equal to zero and find

     Factoring, we have

     Solving for t gives us

                                                                                                                         4.24

     This is the time of flight for a projectile both launched and impacting on a flat horizontal surface. Equation 4.24

does not apply when the projectile lands at a different elevation than it was launched, as we saw in Example 4.8 of
the tennis player hitting the ball into the stands. The other solution, t = 0, corresponds to the time at launch. The
time of flight is linearly proportional to the initial velocity in the y direction and inversely proportional to g. Thus, on
the Moon, where gravity is one-sixth that of Earth, a projectile launched with the same velocity as on Earth would be
airborne six times as long.

Trajectory

The trajectory of a projectile can be found by eliminating the time variable t from the kinematic equations for

arbitrary t and solving for y(x). We take      so the projectile is launched from the origin. The kinematic

equation for x gives

Substituting the expression for t into the equation for the position  gives

Rearranging terms, we have                                                                                                 4.25
This trajectory equation is of the form        which is an equation of a parabola with coefficients

Range
From the trajectory equation we can also find the range, or the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile.
Factoring Equation 4.25, we have

The position y is zero for both the launch point and the impact point, since we are again considering only a flat
horizontal surface. Setting y = 0 in this equation gives solutions x = 0, corresponding to the launch point, and

corresponding to the impact point. Using the trigonometric identity   and setting x = R for range,
we find                                                                                             4.26

Note particularly that Equation 4.26 is valid only for launch and impact on a horizontal surface. We see the range is

directly proportional to the square of the initial speed and          , and it is inversely proportional to the

acceleration of gravity. Thus, on the Moon, the range would be six times greater than on Earth for the same initial

velocity. Furthermore, we see from the factor  that the range is maximum at These results are shown in

Figure 4.15. In (a) we see that the greater the initial velocity, the greater the range. In (b), we see that the range is

maximum at This is true only for conditions neglecting air resistance. If air resistance is considered, the

maximum angle is somewhat smaller. It is interesting that the same range is found for two initial launch angles that

     and want to hit the ball 90 m and let it run onto the green. They angle the shot low to the ground at to the
     horizontal to let the ball roll after impact. On the fourth hole they are 90 m from the green and want to let the ball
     drop with a minimum amount of rolling after impact. Here, they angle the shot at to the horizontal to minimize
     rolling after impact. Both shots are hit and impacted on a level surface.

If the two golf shots in Example 4.9 were launched at the same speed, which shot would have the greatest range?

When we speak of the range of a projectile on level ground, we assume R is very small compared with the
circumference of Earth. If, however, the range is large, Earth curves away below the projectile and the acceleration
resulting from gravity changes direction along the path. The range is larger than predicted by the range equation
given earlier because the projectile has farther to fall than it would on level ground, as shown in Figure 4.17, which
is based on a drawing in Newton's Principia. If the initial speed is great enough, the projectile goes into orbit. Earth's
surface drops 5 m every 8000 m. In 1 s an object falls 5 m without air resistance. Thus, if an object is given a
168  4 · Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

     horizontal velocity of 8000 m/s (or 18,000 mi/hr) near Earth's surface, it will go into orbit around the planet because
     the surface continuously falls away from the object. This is roughly the speed of the Space Shuttle in a low Earth
     orbit when it was operational, or any satellite in a low Earth orbit. These and other aspects of orbital motion, such as
     Earth's rotation, are covered in greater depth in Gravitation.

     increasing initial speed, the range increases and becomes longer than it would be on level ground because Earth curves away beneath its

     4.4 Uniform and Nonuniform Circular Motion

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Solve for the centripetal acceleration of an object moving on a circular path.
         · Use the equations of circular motion to find the position, velocity, and acceleration of a particle executing

             circular motion.
         · Explain the differences between centripetal acceleration and tangential acceleration resulting from

             nonuniform circular motion.
         · Evaluate centripetal and tangential acceleration in nonuniform circular motion, and find the total

             acceleration vector.

     Uniform circular motion is a specific type of motion in which an object travels in a circle with a constant speed. For
     example, any point on a propeller spinning at a constant rate is executing uniform circular motion. Other examples
     are the second, minute, and hour hands of a watch. It is remarkable that points on these rotating objects are
     actually accelerating, although the rotation rate is a constant. To see this, we must analyze the motion in terms of
     vectors.

     Centripetal Acceleration

     In one-dimensional kinematics, objects with a constant speed have zero acceleration. However, in two- and three-

     dimensional kinematics, even if the speed is a constant, a particle can have acceleration if it moves along a curved

     trajectory such as a circle. In this case the velocity vector is changing, or  This is shown in Figure 4.18. As

     the particle moves counterclockwise in time on the circular path, its position vector moves from to

The velocity vector has constant magnitude and is tangent to the path as it changes from to                            changing

its direction only. Since the velocity vector is perpendicular to the position vector the triangles formed by

the position vectors and and the velocity vectors and are similar. Furthermore, since                                                    and

    the two triangles are isosceles. From these facts we can make the assertion

We can find the magnitude of the acceleration from

The direction of the acceleration can also be found by noting that as and therefore approach zero, the vector

approaches a direction perpendicular to In the limit  is perpendicular to Since is tangent to the

circle, the acceleration  points toward the center of the circle. Summarizing, a particle moving in a circle at a

constant speed has an acceleration with magnitude

                                                                                                                                         4.27

The direction of the acceleration vector is toward the center of the circle (Figure 4.19). This is a radial acceleration
and is called the centripetal acceleration, which is why we give it the subscript c. The word centripetal comes from
the Latin words centrum (meaning "center") and petere (meaning "to seek"), and thus takes the meaning "center
seeking."
170  4 · Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

     FIGURE 4.19 The centripetal acceleration vector points toward the center of the circular path of motion and is an acceleration in the radial
     direction. The velocity vector is also shown and is tangent to the circle.

     Let's investigate some examples that illustrate the relative magnitudes of the velocity, radius, and centripetal
     acceleration.

     Creating an Acceleration of 1 g

     A jet is flying at 134.1 m/s along a straight line and makes a turn along a circular path level with the ground. What
     does the radius of the circle have to be to produce a centripetal acceleration of 1 g on the pilot and jet toward the
     center of the circular trajectory?

     Strategy
     Given the speed of the jet, we can solve for the radius of the circle in the expression for the centripetal acceleration.

     Solution
     Set the centripetal acceleration equal to the acceleration of gravity:

     Solving for the radius, we find

     Significance
     To create a greater acceleration than g on the pilot, the jet would either have to decrease the radius of its circular
     trajectory or increase its speed on its existing trajectory or both.

Equations of Motion for Uniform Circular Motion

A particle executing circular motion can be described by its position vector Figure 4.20 shows a particle

executing circular motion in a counterclockwise direction. As the particle moves on the circle, its position vector

sweeps out the angle with the x-axis. Vector making an angle with the x-axis is shown with its components

along the x- and y-axes. The magnitude of the position vector is           and is also the radius of the circle, so that

in terms of its components,

                                                                                                           4.28

Here, is a constant called the angular frequency of the particle. The angular frequency has units of radians (rad)
per second and is simply the number of radians of angular measure through which the particle passes per second.
The angle that the position vector has at any particular time is .

If T is the period of motion, or the time to complete one revolution ( rad), then

FIGURE 4.20 The position vector for a particle in circular motion with its components along the x- and y-axes. The particle moves
counterclockwise. Angle is the angular frequency in radians per second multiplied by t.

Velocity and acceleration can be obtained from the position function by differentiation:

                                                                                                                                                     4.29

It can be shown from Figure 4.20 that the velocity vector is tangential to the circle at the location of the particle,
with magnitude Similarly, the acceleration vector is found by differentiating the velocity:
172  4 · Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

                                                                                                                  4.30

Significance
We picked the initial position of the particle to be on the x-axis. This was completely arbitrary. If a different starting
position were given, we would have a different final position at t = 200 ns.

Nonuniform Circular Motion

Circular motion does not have to be at a constant speed. A particle can travel in a circle and speed up or slow down,
showing an acceleration in the direction of the motion.

In uniform circular motion, the particle executing circular motion has a constant speed and the circle is at a fixed
radius. If the speed of the particle is changing as well, then we introduce an additional acceleration in the direction
tangential to the circle. Such accelerations occur at a point on a top that is changing its spin rate, or any accelerating
rotor. In Displacement and Velocity Vectors we showed that centripetal acceleration is the time rate of change of the
direction of the velocity vector. If the speed of the particle is changing, then it has a tangential acceleration that is
the time rate of change of the magnitude of the velocity:

                                                                                                                                                     4.31

The direction of tangential acceleration is tangent to the circle whereas the direction of centripetal acceleration is
radially inward toward the center of the circle. Thus, a particle in circular motion with a tangential acceleration has a
total acceleration that is the vector sum of the centripetal and tangential accelerations:

                                                                                                                                                     4.32

The acceleration vectors are shown in Figure 4.22. Note that the two acceleration vectors and are
perpendicular to each other, with in the radial direction and in the tangential direction. The total acceleration

             EXAMPLE 4.12

     Total Acceleration during Circular Motion

     A particle moves in a circle of radius r = 2.0 m. During the time interval from t = 1.5 s to t = 4.0 s its speed varies with
     time according to

     What is the total acceleration of the particle at t = 2.0 s?

     Strategy

     We are given the speed of the particle and the radius of the circle, so we can calculate centripetal acceleration

     easily. The direction of the centripetal acceleration is toward the center of the circle. We find the magnitude of the

     tangential acceleration by taking the derivative with respect to time of  using Equation 4.31 and evaluating it at

     t = 2.0 s. We use this and the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration to find the total acceleration.

     directed toward the center of the circle. Tangential acceleration is

4.5 Relative Motion in One and Two Dimensions

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the concept of reference frames.
    · Write the position and velocity vector equations for relative motion.
    · Draw the position and velocity vectors for relative motion.
    · Analyze one-dimensional and two-dimensional relative motion problems using the position and velocity

        vector equations.

Motion does not happen in isolation. If you're riding in a train moving at 10 m/s east, this velocity is measured
relative to the ground on which you're traveling. However, if another train passes you at 15 m/s east, your velocity
relative to this other train is different from your velocity relative to the ground. Your velocity relative to the other
train is 5 m/s west. To explore this idea further, we first need to establish some terminology.

Reference Frames

To discuss relative motion in one or more dimensions, we first introduce the concept of reference frames. When we
say an object has a certain velocity, we must state it has a velocity with respect to a given reference frame. In most
examples we have examined so far, this reference frame has been Earth. If you say a person is sitting in a train
moving at 10 m/s east, then you imply the person on the train is moving relative to the surface of Earth at this
velocity, and Earth is the reference frame. We can expand our view of the motion of the person on the train and say
Earth is spinning in its orbit around the Sun, in which case the motion becomes more complicated. In this case, the
solar system is the reference frame. In summary, all discussion of relative motion must define the reference frames
involved. We now develop a method to refer to reference frames in relative motion. This method makes an
approximation that breaks down near the speed of light, where the more accurate methods or special relativity are
needed, but is extremely accurate for everyday speeds (Relativity (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-
volume-3/pages/5-introduction)).

Relative Motion in One Dimension

We introduce relative motion in one dimension first, because the velocity vectors simplify to having only two
possible directions. Take the example of the person sitting in a train moving east. If we choose east as the positive
direction and Earth as the reference frame, then we can write the velocity of the train with respect to the Earth as

                     east, where the subscripts TE refer to train and Earth. Let's now say the person gets up out of her
seat and walks toward the back of the train at 2 m/s. This tells us she has a velocity relative to the reference frame
176  4 · Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

     of the train. Since the person is walking west, in the negative direction, we write her velocity with respect to the train

     as  We can add the two velocity vectors to find the velocity of the person with respect to Earth. This

     relative velocity is written as

                                                                                                                        4.33

     Note the ordering of the subscripts for the various reference frames in Equation 4.33. The subscripts for the
     coupling reference frame, which is the train, appear consecutively in the right-hand side of the equation. Figure 4.24
     shows the correct order of subscripts when forming the vector equation.

     FIGURE 4.24 When constructing the vector equation, the subscripts for the coupling reference frame appear consecutively on the inside.
     The subscripts on the left-hand side of the equation are the same as the two outside subscripts on the right-hand side of the equation.

     Adding the vectors, we find             so the person is moving 8 m/s east with respect to Earth. Graphically,
     this is shown in Figure 4.25.

         FIGURE 4.25 Velocity vectors of the train with respect to Earth, person with respect to the train, and person with respect to Earth.

     Relative Velocity in Two Dimensions

     We can now apply these concepts to describing motion in two dimensions. Consider a particle P and reference

     frames S and as shown in Figure 4.26. The position of the origin of as measured in S is                            the position of P

     as measured in is                and the position of P as measured in S is

                               FIGURE 4.26 The positions of particle P relative to frames S and are and  respectively.

     From Figure 4.26 we see that

                                                                                                                        4.34

     The relative velocities are the time derivatives of the position vectors. Therefore,

                                                                                                                        4.35

     The velocity of a particle relative to S is equal to its velocity relative to plus the velocity of relative to S.

We can extend Equation 4.35 to any number of reference frames. For particle P with velocities
in frames A, B, and C,

                                                                                                                           4.36

We can also see how the accelerations are related as observed in two reference frames by differentiating Equation
4.35:

We see that if the velocity of relative to S is a constant, then  and

                                                                                                                           4.38

This says the acceleration of a particle is the same as measured by two observers moving at a constant velocity
relative to each other.

        EXAMPLE 4.13

Motion of a Car Relative to a Truck

A truck is traveling south at a speed of 70 km/h toward an intersection. A car is traveling east toward the
intersection at a speed of 80 km/h (Figure 4.27). What is the velocity of the car relative to the truck?

          FIGURE 4.27 A car travels east toward an intersection while a truck travels south toward the same intersection.

Strategy

First, we must establish the reference frame common to both vehicles, which is Earth. Then, we write the velocities
of each with respect to the reference frame of Earth, which enables us to form a vector equation that links the car,
the truck, and Earth to solve for the velocity of the car with respect to the truck.

Solution

The velocity of the car with respect to Earth is                  The velocity of the truck with respect to Earth is

          Using the velocity addition rule, the relative motion equation we are seeking is
178  4 · Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

     Here, is the velocity of the car with respect to the truck, and Earth is the connecting reference frame. Since we

     have the velocity of the truck with respect to Earth, the negative of this vector is the velocity of Earth with respect to

     the truck:  The vector diagram of this equation is shown in Figure 4.28.

                                      FIGURE 4.28 Vector diagram of the vector equation  .

     We can now solve for the velocity of the car with respect to the truck:

     Significance
     Drawing a vector diagram showing the velocity vectors can help in understanding the relative velocity of the two
     objects.

     velocity of the boat with respect to Earth?

             EXAMPLE 4.14

     Flying a Plane in a Wind

     A pilot must fly a plane due north to reach their destination. The plane can fly at 300 km/h in still air. A wind is
     blowing out of the northeast at 90 km/h. (a) In what direction must the pilot head the plane to fly due north? (b)
     What is the speed of the plane relative to the ground?
     Strategy
     The pilot must point the plane somewhat east of north to compensate for the wind velocity. We need to construct a
     vector equation that contains the velocity of the plane with respect to the ground, the velocity of the plane with
     respect to the air, and the velocity of the air with respect to the ground. Since these last two quantities are known,
     we can solve for the velocity of the plane with respect to the ground. We can graph the vectors and use this diagram
     to evaluate the magnitude of the plane's velocity with respect to the ground. The diagram will also tell us the angle
     the plane's velocity makes with north with respect to the air, which is the direction the pilot must head the plane.

Newton's Laws of Motion

FIGURE 5.1 The Golden Gate Bridge, one of the greatest works of modern engineering, was the longest suspension bridge in the world in
the year it opened, 1937. It is still among the longest suspension bridges. In designing and building a bridge, what physics must we
consider? What forces act on the bridge? What forces keep the bridge from falling? How do the towers, cables, and ground interact to

INTRODUCTION When you drive across a bridge, you expect it to remain stable. You also expect to speed up or
slow your car in response to traffic changes. In both cases, you deal with forces. The forces on the bridge are in
equilibrium, so it stays in place. In contrast, the force produced by your car engine causes a change in motion. Isaac
Newton discovered the laws of motion that describe these situations.
Forces affect every moment of your life. Your body is held to Earth by force and held together by the forces of
charged particles. When you open a door, walk down a street, lift your fork, or touch a baby's face, you are applying
forces. Zooming in deeper, your body's atoms are held together by electrical forces, and the core of the atom, called
the nucleus, is held together by the strongest force we know--strong nuclear force.

     5.1 Forces

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Distinguish between kinematics and dynamics
         · Understand the definition of force
         · Identify simple free-body diagrams
         · Define the SI unit of force, the newton
         · Describe force as a vector

     The study of motion is called kinematics, but kinematics only describes the way objects move--their velocity and
     their acceleration. Dynamics is the study of how forces affect the motion of objects and systems. It considers the
     causes of motion of objects and systems of interest, where a system is anything being analyzed. The foundation of
     dynamics are the laws of motion stated by Isaac Newton (1642-1727). These laws provide an example of the
     breadth and simplicity of principles under which nature functions. They are also universal laws in that they apply to
     situations on Earth and in space.

     Newton's laws of motion were just one part of the monumental work that has made him legendary (Figure 5.2). The

     development of Newton's laws marks the transition from the Renaissance to the modern era. Not until the advent of

     modern physics was it discovered that Newton's laws produce a good description of motion only when the objects

     are moving at speeds much less than the speed of light and when those objects are larger than the size of most

     molecules (about  m in diameter). These constraints define the realm of Newtonian mechanics. At the

     beginning of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) developed the theory of relativity and, along with

     many other scientists, quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics does not have the constraints present in

     Newtonian physics. All of the situations we consider in this chapter, and all those preceding the introduction of

     relativity in Relativity (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/5-introduction), are in the

     realm of Newtonian physics.

     FIGURE 5.2 Isaac Newton (1642-1727) published his amazing work, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, in 1687. It proposed
     scientific laws that still apply today to describe the motion of objects (the laws of motion). Newton also discovered the law of gravity,
     invented calculus, and made great contributions to the theories of light and color.

     Working Definition of Force

     Dynamics is the study of the forces that cause objects and systems to move. To understand this, we need a working
     definition of force. An intuitive definition of force--that is, a push or a pull--is a good place to start. We know that a
     push or a pull has both magnitude and direction (therefore, it is a vector quantity), so we can define force as the
     push or pull on an object with a specific magnitude and direction. Force can be represented by vectors or expressed

     Access for free at openstax.org
5.1 · Forces                                                                                                                               193

as a multiple of a standard force.

The push or pull on an object can vary considerably in either magnitude or direction. For example, a cannon exerts a
strong force on a cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, Earth exerts only a tiny downward pull on a
flea. Our everyday experiences also give us a good idea of how multiple forces add. If two people push in different
directions on a third person, as illustrated in Figure 5.3, we might expect the total force to be in the direction shown.
Since force is a vector, it adds just like other vectors. Forces, like other vectors, are represented by arrows and can
be added using the familiar head-to-tail method or trigonometric methods. These ideas were developed in Vectors.

FIGURE 5.3 (a) An overhead view of two ice skaters pushing on a third skater. Forces are vectors and add like other vectors, so the total
force on the third skater is in the direction shown. (b) A free-body diagram representing the forces acting on the third skater.

Figure 5.3(b) is our first example of a free-body diagram, which is a sketch showing all external forces acting on an
object or system. The object or system is represented by a single isolated point (or free body), and only those forces
acting on it that originate outside of the object or system--that is, external forces--are shown. (These forces are the
only ones shown because only external forces acting on the free body affect its motion. We can ignore any internal
forces within the body.) The forces are represented by vectors extending outward from the free body.

Free-body diagrams are useful in analyzing forces acting on an object or system, and are employed extensively in
the study and application of Newton's laws of motion. You will see them throughout this text and in all your studies
of physics. The following steps briefly explain how a free-body diagram is created; we examine this strategy in more
detail in Drawing Free-Body Diagrams.

        PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Drawing Free-Body Diagrams

  1. Draw the object under consideration. If you are treating the object as a particle, represent the object as a
       point. Place this point at the origin of an xy-coordinate system.

  2. Include all forces that act on the object, representing these forces as vectors. However, do not include the net
        force on the object or the forces that the object exerts on its environment.

  3. Resolve all force vectors into x- and y-components.
  4. Draw a separate free-body diagram for each object in the problem.

We illustrate this strategy with two examples of free-body diagrams (Figure 5.4). The terms used in this figure are
explained in more detail later in the chapter.

     The steps given here are sufficient to guide you in this important problem-solving strategy. The final section of this
     chapter explains in more detail how to draw free-body diagrams when working with the ideas presented in this
     chapter.

     Development of the Force Concept

     A quantitative definition of force can be based on some standard force, just as distance is measured in units relative
     to a standard length. One possibility is to stretch a spring a certain fixed distance (Figure 5.5) and use the force it
     exerts to pull itself back to its relaxed shape--called a restoring force--as a standard. The magnitude of all other
     forces can be considered as multiples of this standard unit of force. Many other possibilities exist for standard
     forces. Some alternative definitions of force will be given later in this chapter.

     FIGURE 5.5 The force exerted by a stretched spring can be used as a standard unit of force. (a) This spring has a length x when undistorted.

     (b) When stretched a distance , the spring exerts a restoring force  which is reproducible. (c) A spring scale is one device that

     uses a spring to measure force. The force    is exerted on whatever is attached to the hook. Here, this force has a magnitude of six
     units of the force standard being employed.

     Let's analyze force more deeply. Suppose a physics student sits at a table, working diligently on his homework
     (Figure 5.6). What external forces act on him? Can we determine the origin of these forces?

                                                                             5.1 · Forces                                                           195

FIGURE 5.6 (a) The forces acting on the student are due to the chair, the table, the floor, and Earth's gravitational attraction. (b) In solving a
problem involving the student, we may want to consider only the forces acting along the line running through his torso. A free-body diagram
for this situation is shown.

In most situations, forces are grouped into two categories: contact forces and field forces. As you might guess,
contact forces are due to direct physical contact between objects. For example, the student in Figure 5.6

experiences the contact forces , , and , which are exerted by the chair on his posterior, the floor on his feet, and
the table on his forearms, respectively. Field forces, however, act without the necessity of physical contact between
objects. They depend on the presence of a "field" in the region of space surrounding the body under consideration.
Since the student is in Earth's gravitational field, he feels a gravitational force ; in other words, he has weight.

You can think of a field as a property of space that is detectable by the forces it exerts. Scientists think there are only

four fundamental force fields in nature. These are the gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak fields

(we consider these four forces in nature later in this text). As noted for in Figure 5.6, the gravitational field is

responsible for the weight of a body. The forces of the electromagnetic field include those of static electricity and

magnetism; they are also responsible for the attraction among atoms in bulk matter. Both the strong nuclear and the

weak force fields are effective only over distances roughly equal to a length of scale no larger than an atomic

nucleus (   ). Their range is so small that neither field has influence in the macroscopic world of Newtonian

mechanics.

Contact forces are fundamentally electromagnetic. While the elbow of the student in Figure 5.6 is in contact with the
tabletop, the atomic charges in his skin interact electromagnetically with the charges in the surface of the table. The

net (total) result is the force . Similarly, when adhesive tape sticks to a piece of paper, the atoms of the tape are
intermingled with those of the paper to cause a net electromagnetic force between the two objects. However, in the
context of Newtonian mechanics, the electromagnetic origin of contact forces is not an important concern.

Vector Notation for Force

As previously discussed, force is a vector; it has both magnitude and direction. The SI unit of force is called the

newton (abbreviated N), and 1 N is the force needed to accelerate an object with a mass of 1 kg at a rate of           :

            An easy way to remember the size of a newton is to imagine holding a small apple; it has a

weight of about 1 N.

We can thus describe a two-dimensional force in the form  (the unit vectors  indicate the

direction of these forces along the x-axis and the y-axis, respectively) and a three-dimensional force in the form

            In Figure 5.3, let's suppose that ice skater 1, on the left side of the figure, pushes horizontally
196  5 · Newton's Laws of Motion

     with a force of 30.0 N to the right; we represent this as         Similarly, if ice skater 2 pushes with a force of

     40.0 N in the positive vertical direction shown, we would write   The resultant of the two forces

     causes a mass to accelerate--in this case, the third ice skater. This resultant is called the net external force
     and is found by taking the vector sum of all external forces acting on an object or system (thus, we can also

     represent net external force as  ):

                                                                                                                              5.1

     This equation can be extended to any number of forces.

     In this example, we have                                          . The hypotenuse of the triangle shown in

     Figure 5.3 is the resultant force, or net force. It is a vector. To find its magnitude (the size of the vector, without
     regard to direction), we use the rule given in Vectors, taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the
     components:

     The direction is given by

     measured from the positive x-axis, as shown in the free-body diagram in Figure 5.3(b).

     Let's suppose the ice skaters now push the third ice skater with  and                                             . What

     is the resultant of these two forces? We must recognize that force is a vector; therefore, we must add using the rules

     for vector addition:

     explanation of this observation.

  NEWTON'S FIRST LAW OF MOTION

  A body at rest remains at rest or, if in motion, remains in motion at constant velocity unless acted on by a net
  external force.

Note the repeated use of the verb "remains." We can think of this law as preserving the status quo of motion. Also
note the expression "constant velocity;" this means that the object maintains a path along a straight line, since
neither the magnitude nor the direction of the velocity vector changes. We can use Figure 5.7 to consider the two
parts of Newton's first law.

FIGURE 5.7 (a) A hockey puck is shown at rest; it remains at rest until an outside force such as a hockey stick changes its state of rest; (b) a
hockey puck is shown in motion; it continues in motion in a straight line until an outside force causes it to change its state of motion.
Although it is slick, an ice surface provides some friction that slows the puck.

Rather than contradicting our experience, Newton's first law says that there must be a cause for any change in
velocity (a change in either magnitude or direction) to occur. This cause is a net external force, which we defined
earlier in the chapter. An object sliding across a table or floor slows down due to the net force of friction acting on
the object. If friction disappears, will the object still slow down?
The idea of cause and effect is crucial in accurately describing what happens in various situations. For example,
consider what happens to an object sliding along a rough horizontal surface. The object quickly grinds to a halt. If we
spray the surface with talcum powder to make the surface smoother, the object slides farther. If we make the
surface even smoother by rubbing lubricating oil on it, the object slides farther yet. Extrapolating to a frictionless
surface and ignoring air resistance, we can imagine the object sliding in a straight line indefinitely. Friction is thus the
cause of slowing (consistent with Newton's first law). The object would not slow down if friction were eliminated.
Consider an air hockey table (Figure 5.8). When the air is turned off, the puck slides only a short distance before
friction slows it to a stop. However, when the air is turned on, it creates a nearly frictionless surface, and the puck
glides long distances without slowing down. Additionally, if we know enough about the friction, we can accurately
predict how quickly the object slows down.

FIGURE 5.8 An air hockey table is useful in illustrating Newton's laws. When the air is off, friction quickly slows the puck; but when the air is
on, it minimizes contact between the puck and the hockey table, and the puck glides far down the table.
198  5 · Newton's Laws of Motion

     Newton's first law is general and can be applied to anything from an object sliding on a table to a satellite in orbit to
     blood pumped from the heart. Experiments have verified that any change in velocity (speed or direction) must be
     caused by an external force. The idea of generally applicable or universal laws is important--it is a basic feature of all
     laws of physics. Identifying these laws is like recognizing patterns in nature from which further patterns can be
     discovered. The genius of Galileo, who first developed the idea for the first law of motion, and Newton, who clarified
     it, was to ask the fundamental question: "What is the cause?" Thinking in terms of cause and effect is fundamentally
     different from the typical ancient Greek approach, when questions such as "Why does a tiger have stripes?" would
     have been answered in Aristotelian fashion, such as "That is the nature of the beast." The ability to think in terms of
     cause and effect is the ability to make a connection between an observed behavior and the surrounding world.

     Gravitation and Inertia

     Regardless of the scale of an object, whether a molecule or a subatomic particle, two properties remain valid and
     thus of interest to physics: gravitation and inertia. Both are connected to mass. Roughly speaking, mass is a
     measure of the amount of matter in something. Gravitation is the attraction of one mass to another, such as the
     attraction between yourself and Earth that holds your feet to the floor. The magnitude of this attraction is your
     weight, and it is a force.

     Mass is also related to inertia, the ability of an object to resist changes in its motion--in other words, to resist
     acceleration. Newton's first law is often called the law of inertia. As we know from experience, some objects have
     more inertia than others. It is more difficult to change the motion of a large boulder than that of a basketball, for
     example, because the boulder has more mass than the basketball. In other words, the inertia of an object is
     measured by its mass. The relationship between mass and weight is explored later in this chapter.

     Inertial Reference Frames

     Earlier, we stated Newton's first law as "A body at rest remains at rest or, if in motion, remains in motion at constant
     velocity unless acted on by a net external force." It can also be stated as "Every body remains in its state of uniform
     motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces acting on it." To Newton, "uniform
     motion in a straight line" meant constant velocity, which includes the case of zero velocity, or rest. Therefore, the
     first law says that the velocity of an object remains constant if the net force on it is zero.

     Newton's first law is usually considered to be a statement about reference frames. It provides a method for
     identifying a special type of reference frame: the inertial reference frame. In principle, we can make the net force
     on a body zero. If its velocity relative to a given frame is constant, then that frame is said to be inertial. So by
     definition, an inertial reference frame is a reference frame in which Newton's first law is valid. Newton's first law
     applies to objects with constant velocity. From this fact, we can infer the following statement.

       INERTIAL REFERENCE FRAME

       A reference frame moving at constant velocity relative to an inertial frame is also inertial. A reference frame
       accelerating relative to an inertial frame is not inertial.

     Are inertial frames common in nature? It turns out that well within experimental error, a reference frame at rest

     relative to the most distant, or "fixed," stars is inertial. All frames moving uniformly with respect to this fixed-star

     frame are also inertial. For example, a nonrotating reference frame attached to the Sun is, for all practical purposes,

     inertial, because its velocity relative to the fixed stars does not vary by more than one part in  Earth

     accelerates relative to the fixed stars because it rotates on its axis and revolves around the Sun; hence, a reference

     frame attached to its surface is not inertial. For most problems, however, such a frame serves as a sufficiently

     accurate approximation to an inertial frame, because the acceleration of a point on Earth's surface relative to the

     fixed stars is rather small (    ). Thus, unless indicated otherwise, we consider reference frames

     fixed on Earth to be inertial.

     Finally, no particular inertial frame is more special than any other. As far as the laws of nature are concerned, all
     inertial frames are equivalent. In analyzing a problem, we choose one inertial frame over another simply on the
     basis of convenience.

Newton's First Law and Equilibrium

Newton's first law tells us about the equilibrium of a system, which is the state in which the forces on the system are

balanced. Returning to Forces and the ice skaters in Figure 5.3, we know that the forces and combine to form

a resultant force, or the net external force:           To create equilibrium, we require a balancing

force that will produce a net force of zero. This force must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to

which means the vector must be  Referring to the ice skaters, for which we found to be                           ,

we can determine the balancing force by simply finding  See the free-body diagram in
Figure 5.3(b).

We can give Newton's first law in vector form:

                                                                                                                 5.2

This equation says that a net force of zero implies that the velocity of the object is constant. (The word "constant"
can indicate zero velocity.)

Newton's first law is deceptively simple. If a car is at rest, the only forces acting on the car are weight and the
contact force of the pavement pushing up on the car (Figure 5.9). It is easy to understand that a nonzero net force is
required to change the state of motion of the car. As a car moves with constant velocity, the friction force propels the
car forward and opposes the drag force against it.

FIGURE 5.9 A car is shown (a) parked and (b) moving at constant velocity. How do Newton's laws apply to the parked car? What does the
knowledge that the car is moving at constant velocity tell us about the net horizontal force on the car?

        EXAMPLE 5.1

When Does Newton's First Law Apply to Your Car?

Newton's laws can be applied to all physical processes involving force and motion, including something as mundane
as driving a car.

(a) Your car is parked outside your house. Does Newton's first law apply in this situation? Why or why not?

(b) Your car moves at constant velocity down the street. Does Newton's first law apply in this situation? Why or why
not?

Strategy
In (a), we are considering the first part of Newton's first law, dealing with a body at rest; in (b), we look at the second
part of Newton's first law for a body in motion.

Solution

  a. When your car is parked, all forces on the car must be balanced; the vector sum is 0 N. Thus, the net force is
        zero, and Newton's first law applies. The acceleration of the car is zero, and in this case, the velocity is also
        zero.

  b. When your car is moving at constant velocity down the street, the net force must also be zero according to
        Newton's first law. The car's frictional force between the road and tires opposes the drag force on the car with
        the same magnitude, producing a net force of zero. The body continues in its state of constant velocity until
200  5 · Newton's Laws of Motion

            the net force becomes nonzero. Realize that a net force of zero means that an object is either at rest or moving
            with constant velocity, that is, it is not accelerating. What do you suppose happens when the car accelerates?
             We explore this idea in the next section.

     Significance
     As this example shows, there are two kinds of equilibrium. In (a), the car is at rest; we say it is in static equilibrium.
     In (b), the forces on the car are balanced, but the car is moving; we say that it is in dynamic equilibrium. (We
     examine this idea in more detail in Static Equilibrium and Elasticity.) Again, it is possible for two (or more) forces to
     act on an object yet for the object to move. In addition, a net force of zero cannot produce acceleration.

         · Explain the dependence of acceleration on net force and mass

     Newton's second law is closely related to his first law. It mathematically gives the cause-and-effect relationship
     between force and changes in motion. Newton's second law is quantitative and is used extensively to calculate what
     happens in situations involving a force. Before we can write down Newton's second law as a simple equation that
     gives the exact relationship of force, mass, and acceleration, we need to sharpen some ideas we mentioned earlier.

     Force and Acceleration

     First, what do we mean by a change in motion? The answer is that a change in motion is equivalent to a change in
     velocity. A change in velocity means, by definition, that there is acceleration. Newton's first law says that a net
     external force causes a change in motion; thus, we see that a net external force causes nonzero acceleration.

     We defined external force in Forces as force acting on an object or system that originates outside of the object or
     system. Let's consider this concept further. An intuitive notion of external is correct--it is outside the system of
     interest. For example, in Figure 5.10(a), the system of interest is the car plus the person within it. The two forces
     exerted by the two students are external forces. In contrast, an internal force acts between elements of the system.
     Thus, the force the person in the car exerts to hang on to the steering wheel is an internal force between elements of
     the system of interest. Only external forces affect the motion of a system, according to Newton's first law. (The
     internal forces cancel each other out, as explained in the next section.) Therefore, we must define the boundaries of
     the system before we can determine which forces are external. Sometimes, the system is obvious, whereas at other
     times, identifying the boundaries of a system is more subtle. The concept of a system is fundamental to many areas
     of physics, as is the correct application of Newton's laws. This concept is revisited many times in the study of
     physics.

FIGURE 5.10 Different forces exerted on the same mass produce different accelerations. (a) Two students push a stalled car. All external
forces acting on the car are shown. (b) The forces acting on the car are transferred to a coordinate plane (free-body diagram) for simpler
analysis. (c) The tow truck can produce greater external force on the same mass, and thus greater acceleration.

From this example, you can see that different forces exerted on the same mass produce different accelerations. In
Figure 5.10(a), the two students push a car with a driver in it. Arrows representing all external forces are shown. The

system of interest is the car and its driver. The weight of the system and the support of the ground are also
shown for completeness and are assumed to cancel (because there was no vertical motion and no imbalance of

forces in the vertical direction to create a change in motion). The vector represents the friction acting on the car,
and it acts to the left, opposing the motion of the car. (We discuss friction in more detail in the next chapter.) In

Figure 5.10(b), all external forces acting on the system add together to produce the net force  The free-body

diagram shows all of the forces acting on the system of interest. The dot represents the center of mass of the

system. Each force vector extends from this dot. Because there are two forces acting to the right, the vectors are

shown collinearly. Finally, in Figure 5.10(c), a larger net external force produces a larger acceleration       when
the tow truck pulls the car.

It seems reasonable that acceleration would be directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external
force acting on a system. This assumption has been verified experimentally and is illustrated in Figure 5.10. To
obtain an equation for Newton's second law, we first write the relationship of acceleration and net external force

      as the proportionality
202  5 · Newton's Laws of Motion

     where the symbol means "proportional to." (Recall from Forces that the net external force is the vector sum of all

     external forces and is sometimes indicated as  ) This proportionality shows what we have said in

     words--acceleration is directly proportional to net external force. Once the system of interest is chosen, identify the
     external forces and ignore the internal ones. It is a tremendous simplification to disregard the numerous internal
     forces acting between objects within the system, such as muscular forces within the students' bodies, let alone the
     myriad forces between the atoms in the objects. Still, this simplification helps us solve some complex problems.

     It also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely proportional to the mass of the system. In other
     words, the larger the mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration produced by a given force. As illustrated in
     Figure 5.11, the same net external force applied to a basketball produces a much smaller acceleration when it is
     applied to an SUV. The proportionality is written as

     where m is the mass of the system and a is the magnitude of the acceleration. Experiments have shown that
     acceleration is exactly inversely proportional to mass, just as it is directly proportional to net external force.

     FIGURE 5.11 The same force exerted on systems of different masses produces different accelerations. (a) A basketball player pushes on a
     basketball to make a pass. (Ignore the effect of gravity on the ball.) (b) The same player exerts an identical force on a stalled SUV and
     produces far less acceleration. (c) The free-body diagrams are identical, permitting direct comparison of the two situations. A series of
     patterns for free-body diagrams will emerge as you do more problems and learn how to draw them in Drawing Free-Body Diagrams.

     It has been found that the acceleration of an object depends only on the net external force and the mass of the
     object. Combining the two proportionalities just given yields Newton's second law.

       NEWTON'S SECOND LAW OF MOTION

       The acceleration of a system is directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force acting
       on the system and is inversely proportional to its mass. In equation form, Newton's second law is

     where is the acceleration,       is the net force, and m is the mass. This is often written in the more familiar
     form

                                                                                                                                                 5.3

but the first equation gives more insight into what Newton's second law means. When only the magnitude of
force and acceleration are considered, this equation can be written in the simpler scalar form:

                                                                                                                                                 5.4

The law is a cause-and-effect relationship among three quantities that is not simply based on their definitions. The
validity of the second law is based on experimental verification. The free-body diagram, which you will learn to draw
in Drawing Free-Body Diagrams, is the basis for writing Newton's second law.

        EXAMPLE 5.2

What Acceleration Can a Person Produce When Pushing a Lawn Mower?

Suppose that the net external force (push minus friction) exerted on a lawn mower is 51 N (about 11 lb.) parallel to
the ground (Figure 5.12). The mass of the mower is 24 kg. What is its acceleration?

FIGURE 5.12 (a) The net force on a lawn mower is 51 N to the right. At what rate does the lawn mower accelerate to the right? (b) The free-
body diagram for this problem is shown.

Strategy

This problem involves only motion in the horizontal direction; we are also given the net force, indicated by the single
vector, but we can suppress the vector nature and concentrate on applying Newton's second law. Since and m
are given, the acceleration can be calculated directly from Newton's second law as

Solution                                . Entering known values gives
The magnitude of the acceleration a is

Substituting the unit of kilograms times meters per square second for newtons yields

Significance

The direction of the acceleration is the same direction as that of the net force, which is parallel to the ground. This is
a result of the vector relationship expressed in Newton's second law, that is, the vector representing net force is the
scalar multiple of the acceleration vector. There is no information given in this example about the individual external
forces acting on the system, but we can say something about their relative magnitudes. For example, the force
exerted by the person pushing the mower must be greater than the friction opposing the motion (since we know the
mower moved forward), and the vertical forces must cancel because no acceleration occurs in the vertical direction
204  5 · Newton's Laws of Motion

     (the mower is moving only horizontally). The acceleration found is small enough to be reasonable for a person
     pushing a mower. Such an effort would not last too long, because the person's top speed would soon be reached.

               . If a force of 6 MN                    was applied to the ship, what acceleration would it experience?

     In the preceding example, we dealt with net force only for simplicity. However, several forces act on the lawn
     mower. The weight (discussed in detail in Mass and Weight) pulls down on the mower, toward the center of Earth;
     this produces a contact force on the ground. The ground must exert an upward force on the lawn mower, known as

     the normal force , which we define in Common Forces. These forces are balanced and therefore do not produce
     vertical acceleration. In the next example, we show both of these forces. As you continue to solve problems using
     Newton's second law, be sure to show multiple forces.

     Strategy
     We must consider Newton's first and second laws to analyze the situation. We need to decide which law applies;
     this, in turn, will tell us about the relationship between the forces.

     Solution

     a. The forces are equal. According to Newton's first law, if the net force is zero, the velocity is constant.

     b. In this case,             must be larger than  According to Newton's second law, a net force is required to

move, it must be accelerated from rest to the desired speed; this requires that the friction force be greater than the
drag force. Once the car is moving at constant velocity, the net force must be zero; otherwise, the car will accelerate
(gain speed). To solve problems involving Newton's laws, we must understand whether to apply Newton's first law

(where  ) or Newton's second law (where                   is not zero). This will be apparent as you see more

examples and attempt to solve problems on your own.

        EXAMPLE 5.4

What Rocket Thrust Accelerates This Sled?

Before space flights carrying astronauts, rocket sleds were used to test aircraft, missile equipment, and
physiological effects on human subjects at high speeds. They consisted of a platform that was mounted on one or
two rails and propelled by several rockets.

Calculate the magnitude of force exerted by each rocket, called its thrust T, for the four-rocket propulsion system

shown in Figure 5.14. The sled's initial acceleration is  , the mass of the system is 2100 kg, and the force of

friction opposing the motion is 650 N.

FIGURE 5.14 A sled experiences a rocket thrust that accelerates it to the right. Each rocket creates an identical thrust T. The system here is

the sled, its rockets, and its rider, so none of the forces between these objects are considered. The arrow representing friction  is drawn
larger than scale.

Strategy

Although forces are acting both vertically and horizontally, we assume the vertical forces cancel because there is no
vertical acceleration. This leaves us with only horizontal forces and a simpler one-dimensional problem. Directions
are indicated with plus or minus signs, with right taken as the positive direction. See the free-body diagram in Figure
5.14.

Solution

Since acceleration, mass, and the force of friction are given, we start with Newton's second law and look for ways to
find the thrust of the engines. We have defined the direction of the force and acceleration as acting "to the right," so
we need to consider only the magnitudes of these quantities in the calculations. Hence we begin with
206  5 · Newton's Laws of Motion

     where is the net force along the horizontal direction. We can see from the figure that the engine thrusts add,
     whereas friction opposes the thrust. In equation form, the net external force is

     Substituting this into Newton's second law gives us

     Using a little algebra, we solve for the total thrust 4T:

     Substituting known values yields

     Therefore, the total thrust is
     and the individual thrusts are

     Significance

     The numbers are quite large, so the result might surprise you. Experiments such as this were performed in the early

     1960s to test the limits of human endurance, and the setup was designed to protect human subjects in jet fighter

     emergency ejections. Speeds of 1000 km/h were obtained, with accelerations of 45 g's. (Recall that g, acceleration

     due to gravity, is           . When we say that acceleration is 45 g's, it is  which is approximately

                 .) Although living subjects are not used anymore, land speeds of 10,000 km/h have been obtained with a
     rocket sled.

     In this example, as in the preceding one, the system of interest is obvious. We see in later examples that choosing
     the system of interest is crucial--and the choice is not always obvious.

     Newton's second law is more than a definition; it is a relationship among acceleration, force, and mass. It can help
     us make predictions. Each of those physical quantities can be defined independently, so the second law tells us
     something basic and universal about nature.

     car's acceleration?

     Component Form of Newton's Second Law

     We have developed Newton's second law and presented it as a vector equation in Equation 5.3. This vector equation
     can be written as three component equations:

                                                                                                                                                            5.5

     The second law is a description of how a body responds mechanically to its environment. The influence of the

     environment is the net force      the body's response is the acceleration and the strength of the response is

     inversely proportional to the mass m. The larger the mass of an object, the smaller its response (its acceleration) to

     the influence of the environment (a given net force). Therefore, a body's mass is a measure of its inertia, as we

Newton's Second Law and Momentum

Newton actually stated his second law in terms of momentum: "The instantaneous rate at which a body's
momentum changes is equal to the net force acting on the body." ("Instantaneous rate" implies that the derivative is
involved.) This can be given by the vector equation

                                                                                                                                                       5.6

This means that Newton's second law addresses the central question of motion: What causes a change in motion of
an object? Momentum was described by Newton as "quantity of motion," a way of combining both the velocity of an
object and its mass. We devote Linear Momentum and Collisions to the study of momentum.
For now, it is sufficient to define momentum as the product of the mass of the object m and its velocity :

                                                                                                                                                       5.7

Since velocity is a vector, so is momentum.
It is easy to visualize momentum. A train moving at 10 m/s has more momentum than one that moves at 2 m/s. In
everyday life, we speak of one sports team as "having momentum" when they score points against the opposing
team.
If we substitute Equation 5.7 into Equation 5.6, we obtain

When m is constant, we have

Thus, we see that the momentum form of Newton's second law reduces to the form given earlier in this section.

     5.4 Mass and Weight

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the difference between mass and weight
         · Explain why objects falling through the air are never truly in free fall
         · Describe the concept of weightlessness

     Mass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday conversation. For example, our medical records often
     show our weight in kilograms but never in the correct units of newtons. In physics, however, there is an important
     distinction. Weight is the pull of Earth on an object. It depends on the distance from the center of Earth. Unlike
     weight, mass does not vary with location. The mass of an object is the same on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of
     the Moon.

     Units of Force

     The equation    is used to define net force in terms of mass, length, and time. As explained earlier, the SI

     unit of force is the newton. Since

     Although almost the entire world uses the newton for the unit of force, in the United States, the most familiar unit of
     force is the pound (lb), where 1 N = 0.225 lb. Thus, a 225-lb person weighs 1000 N.

     Weight and Gravitational Force

     When an object is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth. Newton's second law says that a net force on
     an object is responsible for its acceleration. If air resistance is negligible, the net force on a falling object is the
     gravitational force, commonly called its weight , or its force due to gravity acting on an object of mass m. Weight
     can be denoted as a vector because it has a direction; down is, by definition, the direction of gravity, and hence,
     weight is a downward force. The magnitude of weight is denoted as w. Galileo was instrumental in showing that, in
     the absence of air resistance, all objects fall with the same acceleration g. Using Galileo's result and Newton's
     second law, we can derive an equation for weight.

     Consider an object with mass m falling toward Earth. It experiences only the downward force of gravity, which is the

     weight . Newton's second law says that the magnitude of the net external force on an object is  We

     know that the acceleration of an object due to gravity is or  . Substituting these into Newton's second law

     gives us the following equations.

                                                                                                                        5.8
     The gravitational force on a mass is its weight. We can write this in vector form, where

     In scalar form, we can write
                                                                                                                                                      5.9

     Since           on Earth, the weight of a 1.00-kg object on Earth is 9.80 N:

     When the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it is in free fall, that is, the only force acting on the
     object is gravity. However, when objects on Earth fall downward through the air, they are never truly in free fall
     because there is always some upward resistance force from the air acting on the object.

     Acceleration due to gravity g varies slightly over the surface of Earth, so the weight of an object depends on its
     location and is not an intrinsic property of the object. Weight varies dramatically if we leave Earth's surface. On the

Moon, for example, acceleration due to gravity is only  . A 1.0-kg mass thus has a weight of 9.8 N on Earth
and only about 1.6 N on the Moon.

The broadest definition of weight in this sense is that the weight of an object is the gravitational force on it from the
nearest large body, such as Earth, the Moon, or the Sun. This is the most common and useful definition of weight in
physics. It differs dramatically, however, from the definition of weight used by NASA and the popular media in
relation to space travel and exploration. When they speak of "weightlessness" and "microgravity," they are referring
to the phenomenon we call "free fall" in physics. We use the preceding definition of weight, force due to gravity
acting on an object of mass m, and we make careful distinctions between free fall and actual weightlessness.

Be aware that weight and mass are different physical quantities, although they are closely related. Mass is an
intrinsic property of an object: It is a quantity of matter. The quantity or amount of matter of an object is determined
by the numbers of atoms and molecules of various types it contains. Because these numbers do not vary, in
Newtonian physics, mass does not vary; therefore, its response to an applied force does not vary. In contrast, weight
is the gravitational force acting on an object, so it does vary depending on gravity. For example, a person closer to
the center of Earth, at a low elevation such as New Orleans, weighs slightly more than a person who is located in the
higher elevation of Denver, even though they may have the same mass.

It is tempting to equate mass to weight, because most of our examples take place on Earth, where the weight of an

object varies only a little with the location of the object. In addition, it is difficult to count and identify all of the

atoms and molecules in an object, so mass is rarely determined in this manner. If we consider situations in which

is a constant on Earth, we see that weight is directly proportional to mass m, since   that is, the more

massive an object is, the more it weighs. Operationally, the masses of objects are determined by comparison with

the standard kilogram, as we discussed in Units and Measurement. But by comparing an object on Earth with one on

the Moon, we can easily see a variation in weight but not in mass. For instance, on Earth, a 5.0-kg object weighs 49

N; on the Moon, where g is  , the object weighs 8.4 N. However, the mass of the object is still 5.0 kg on the

Moon.

       EXAMPLE 5.8

Clearing a Field

A farmer is lifting some moderately heavy rocks from a field to plant crops. He lifts a stone that weighs 40.0 lb.
(about 180 N). What force does he apply if the stone accelerates at a rate of

Strategy

We were given the weight of the stone, which we use in finding the net force on the stone. However, we also need to

know its mass to apply Newton's second law, so we must apply the equation for weight,  , to determine the

mass.

Solution

No forces act in the horizontal direction, so we can concentrate on vertical forces, as shown in the following free-
body diagram. We label the acceleration to the side; technically, it is not part of the free-body diagram, but it helps
to remind us that the object accelerates upward (so the net force is upward).

     Significance
     To apply Newton's second law as the primary equation in solving a problem, we sometimes have to rely on other
     equations, such as the one for weight or one of the kinematic equations, to complete the solution.

     5.5 Newton's Third Law

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · State Newton's third law of motion
         · Identify the action and reaction forces in different situations
         · Apply Newton's third law to define systems and solve problems of motion

     We have thus far considered force as a push or a pull; however, if you think about it, you realize that no push or pull
     ever occurs by itself. When you push on a wall, the wall pushes back on you. This brings us to Newton's third law.

     NEWTON'S THIRD LAW OF MOTION                                                                                 on
                                                                                                                  5.10
     Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the first body experiences a force that is equal in
     magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that it exerts. Mathematically, if a body A exerts a force
     body B, then B simultaneously exerts a force on A, or in vector equation form,

     Newton's third law represents a certain symmetry in nature: Forces always occur in pairs, and one body cannot exert
     a force on another without experiencing a force itself. We sometimes refer to this law loosely as "action-reaction,"
     where the force exerted is the action and the force experienced as a consequence is the reaction. Newton's third law
     has practical uses in analyzing the origin of forces and understanding which forces are external to a system.

     We can readily see Newton's third law at work by taking a look at how people move about. Consider a swimmer

     pushing off the side of a pool (Figure 5.16). She pushes against the wall of the pool with her feet and accelerates in

     the direction opposite that of her push. The wall has exerted an equal and opposite force on the swimmer. You might

     think that two equal and opposite forces would cancel, but they do not because they act on different systems. In

     this case, there are two systems that we could investigate: the swimmer and the wall. If we select the swimmer to

     be the system of interest, as in the figure, then  is an external force on this system and affects its motion.

     The swimmer moves in the direction of this force. In contrast, the force            acts on the wall, not on our

     system of interest. Thus,        does not directly affect the motion of the system and does not cancel

     The swimmer pushes in the direction opposite that in which she wishes to move. The reaction to her

     push is thus in the desired direction. In a free-body diagram, such as the one shown in Figure 5.16, we never include

     both forces of an action-reaction pair; in this case, we only use         , not     .

FIGURE 5.16 When the swimmer exerts a force on the wall, she accelerates in the opposite direction; in other words, the net external force

on her is in the direction opposite of  This opposition occurs because, in accordance with Newton's third law, the wall exerts a

force          on the swimmer that is equal in magnitude but in the direction opposite to the one she exerts on it. The line around the

swimmer indicates the system of interest. Thus, the free-body diagram shows only  w (the gravitational force), and BF, which is

the buoyant force of the water supporting the swimmer's weight. The vertical forces w and BF cancel because there is no vertical

acceleration.

Other examples of Newton's third law are easy to find:

· As a professor paces in front of a whiteboard, he exerts a force backward on the floor. The floor exerts a
   reaction force forward on the professor that causes him to accelerate forward.

· A car accelerates forward because the ground pushes forward on the drive wheels, in reaction to the drive
   wheels pushing backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward when tires
   spin on a gravel road and throw the rocks backward.

· Rockets move forward by expelling gas backward at high velocity. This means the rocket exerts a large
   backward force on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber; therefore, the gas exerts a large reaction force
   forward on the rocket. This reaction force, which pushes a body forward in response to a backward force, is
   called thrust. It is a common misconception that rockets propel themselves by pushing on the ground or on
   the air behind them. They actually work better in a vacuum, where they can more readily expel the exhaust
   gases.

· Helicopters create lift by pushing air down, thereby experiencing an upward reaction force.
· Birds and airplanes also fly by exerting force on the air in a direction opposite that of whatever force they

   need. For example, the wings of a bird force air downward and backward to get lift and move forward.
· An octopus propels itself in the water by ejecting water through a funnel from its body, similar to a jet ski.
· When a person pulls down on a vertical rope, the rope pulls up on the person (Figure 5.17).

214  5 · Newton's Laws of Motion

     There are two important features of Newton's third law. First, the forces exerted (the action and reaction) are always
     equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Second, these forces are acting on different bodies or systems: A's
     force acts on B and B's force acts on A. In other words, the two forces are distinct forces that do not act on the same
     body. Thus, they do not cancel each other.

     For the situation shown in Figure 5.6, the third law indicates that because the chair is pushing upward on the boy
     with force he is pushing downward on the chair with force Similarly, he is pushing downward with forces
     and on the floor and table, respectively. Finally, since Earth pulls downward on the boy with force he pulls
     upward on Earth with force . If that student were to angrily pound the table in frustration, he would quickly learn
     the painful lesson (avoidable by studying Newton's laws) that the table hits back just as hard.

     A person who is walking or running applies Newton's third law instinctively. For example, the runner in Figure 5.18
     pushes backward on the ground so that it pushes him forward.

     FIGURE 5.18 The runner experiences Newton's third law. (a) A force is exerted by the runner on the ground. (b) The reaction force of the
     ground on the runner pushes him forward. (credit "runner": modification of work by "Greenwich Photography"/Flickr)

force due to Earth's gravity) and is the force of the scale on the package. (b) Isolation of the package-scale system and the package-Earth

Strategy

The forces on the package are which is due to the scale, and    which is due to Earth's gravitational field. The
reaction forces that the package exerts are on the scale and  on Earth. Because the package is not
accelerating, application of the second law yields

so

The scale reading indicates the magnitude of the force , which is equal to the magnitude of the package's weight.

Significance
The scale actually does not measure the weight of the package; it measures the force on its surface. If the
system is accelerating, and would not be equal, as explained in Applications of Newton's Laws.

Getting Up to Speed: Choosing the Correct System

A physics professor pushes a cart of demonstration equipment to a lecture hall (Figure 5.20). Her mass is 65.0 kg,
the cart's mass is 12.0 kg, and the equipment's mass is 7.0 kg. Calculate the acceleration produced when the
professor exerts a backward force of 150 N on the floor. All forces opposing the motion, such as friction on the cart's
wheels and air resistance, total 24.0 N.
216  5 · Newton's Laws of Motion

     FIGURE 5.20 A professor pushes the cart with her demonstration equipment. The lengths of the arrows are proportional to the magnitudes

     of the forces (except for because it is too small to be drawn to scale). System 1 is appropriate for this example, because it asks for the

     acceleration of the entire group of objects. Only  and are external forces acting on System 1 along the line of motion. All other forces

     either cancel or act on the outside world. System 2 is chosen for the next example so that  is an external force and enters into

     Newton's second law. The free-body diagrams, which serve as the basis for Newton's second law, vary with the system chosen.

     Strategy

     Since they accelerate as a unit, we define the system to be the professor, cart, and equipment. This is System 1 in

     Figure 5.20. The professor pushes backward with a force  of 150 N. According to Newton's third law, the floor

     exerts a forward reaction force  of 150 N on System 1. Because all motion is horizontal, we can assume there

     is no net force in the vertical direction. Therefore, the problem is one-dimensional along the horizontal direction. As

     noted, friction f opposes the motion and is thus in the opposite direction of               We do not include the forces

     or        because these are internal forces, and we do not include                          because it acts on the floor, not on the

     system. There are no other significant forces acting on System 1. If the net external force can be found from all this
     information, we can use Newton's second law to find the acceleration as requested. See the free-body diagram in
     the figure.

     Solution
     Newton's second law is given by

     The net external force on System 1 is deduced from Figure 5.20 and the preceding discussion to be
     The mass of System 1 is
     These values of and m produce an acceleration of

     Significance
     None of the forces between components of System 1, such as between the professor's hands and the cart,
     contribute to the net external force because they are internal to System 1. Another way to look at this is that forces

between components of a system cancel because they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For
example, the force exerted by the professor on the cart results in an equal and opposite force back on the professor.
In this case, both forces act on the same system and therefore cancel. Thus, internal forces (between components
of a system) cancel. Choosing System 1 was crucial to solving this problem.

EXAMPLE 5.11

Force on the Cart: Choosing a New System

Calculate the force the professor exerts on the cart in Figure 5.20, using data from the previous example if needed.

Strategy

If we define the system of interest as the cart plus the equipment (System 2 in Figure 5.20), then the net external

force on System 2 is the force the professor exerts on the cart minus friction. The force she exerts on the cart,       ,

is an external force acting on System 2.  was internal to System 1, but it is external to System 2 and thus enters

Newton's second law for this system.

Solution                                           We start with
Newton's second law can be used to find

The magnitude of the net external force on System 2 is

We solve for  , the desired quantity:

The value of f is given, so we must calculate net  That can be done because both the acceleration and the mass

of System 2 are known. Using Newton's second law, we see that

where the mass of System 2 is 19.0 kg (                           ) and its acceleration was found to be             in
the previous example. Thus,

Now we can find the desired force:

Significance
This force is significantly less than the 150-N force the professor exerted backward on the floor. Not all of that
150-N force is transmitted to the cart; some of it accelerates the professor. The choice of a system is an important
analytical step both in solving problems and in thoroughly understanding the physics of the situation (which are not
necessarily the same things).

     5.6 Common Forces

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define normal and tension forces
         · Distinguish between real and fictitious forces
         · Apply Newton's laws of motion to solve problems involving a variety of forces
     Forces are given many names, such as push, pull, thrust, and weight. Traditionally, forces have been grouped into
     several categories and given names relating to their source, how they are transmitted, or their effects. Several of
     these categories are discussed in this section, together with some interesting applications. Further examples of
     forces are discussed later in this text.

     A Catalog of Forces: Normal, Tension, and Other Examples of Forces

     A catalog of forces will be useful for reference as we solve various problems involving force and motion. These
     forces include normal force, tension, friction, and spring force.
     Normal force
     Weight (also called the force of gravity) is a pervasive force that acts at all times and must be counteracted to keep
     an object from falling. You must support the weight of a heavy object by pushing up on it when you hold it stationary,
     as illustrated in Figure 5.21(a). But how do inanimate objects like a table support the weight of a mass placed on
     them, such as shown in Figure 5.21(b)? When the bag of dog food is placed on the table, the table sags slightly
     under the load. This would be noticeable if the load were placed on a card table, but even a sturdy oak table
     deforms when a force is applied to it. Unless an object is deformed beyond its limit, it will exert a restoring force
     much like a deformed spring (or a trampoline or diving board). The greater the deformation, the greater the restoring
     force. Thus, when the load is placed on the table, the table sags until the restoring force becomes as large as the
     weight of the load. At this point, the net external force on the load is zero. That is the situation when the load is
     stationary on the table. The table sags quickly and the sag is slight, so we do not notice it. But it is similar to the
     sagging of a trampoline when you climb onto it.

FIGURE 5.21 (a) The person holding the bag of dog food must supply an upward force  equal in magnitude and opposite in direction

to the weight of the food so that it doesn't drop to the ground. (b) The card table sags when the dog food is placed on it, much like a stiff

trampoline. Elastic restoring forces in the table grow as it sags until they supply a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to
the weight of the load.

We must conclude that whatever supports a load, be it animate or not, must supply an upward force equal to the
weight of the load, as we assumed in a few of the previous examples. If the force supporting the weight of an object,
or a load, is perpendicular to the surface of contact between the load and its support, this force is defined as a

normal force and here is given by the symbol (This is not the newton unit for force, or N.) The word normal
means perpendicular to a surface. This means that the normal force experienced by an object resting on a horizontal
surface can be expressed in vector form as follows:

In scalar form, this becomes

The normal force can be less than the object's weight if the object is on an incline.

        EXAMPLE 5.12
Weight on an Incline

Consider the skier on the slope in Figure 5.22. Her mass including equipment is 60.0 kg. (a) What is her acceleration
if friction is negligible? (b) What is her acceleration if friction is 45.0 N?
220  5 · Newton's Laws of Motion

     FIGURE 5.22 Since the acceleration is parallel to the slope and acting down the slope, it is most convenient to project all forces onto a
     coordinate system where one axis is parallel to the slope and the other is perpendicular to it (axes shown to the left of the skier). is
     perpendicular to the slope and is parallel to the slope, but has components along both axes, namely, and . Here, has a
     squiggly line to show that it has been replaced by these components. The force is equal in magnitude to , so there is no acceleration
     perpendicular to the slope, but f is less than , so there is a downslope acceleration (along the axis parallel to the slope).

     Strategy
     This is a two-dimensional problem, since not all forces on the skier (the system of interest) are parallel. The
     approach we have used in two-dimensional kinematics also works well here. Choose a convenient coordinate
     system and project the vectors onto its axes, creating two one-dimensional problems to solve. The most convenient
     coordinate system for motion on an incline is one that has one coordinate parallel to the slope and one
     perpendicular to the slope. (Motions along mutually perpendicular axes are independent.) We use x and y for the
     parallel and perpendicular directions, respectively. This choice of axes simplifies this type of problem, because
     there is no motion perpendicular to the slope and the acceleration is downslope. Regarding the forces, friction is
     drawn in opposition to motion (friction always opposes forward motion) and is always parallel to the slope, is
     drawn parallel to the slope and downslope (it causes the motion of the skier down the slope), and is drawn as
     the component of weight perpendicular to the slope. Then, we can consider the separate problems of forces parallel
     to the slope and forces perpendicular to the slope.

     Solution
     The magnitude of the component of weight parallel to the slope is

     and the magnitude of the component of the weight perpendicular to the slope is

     a. Neglect friction. Since the acceleration is parallel to the slope, we need only consider forces parallel to the slope.
     (Forces perpendicular to the slope add to zero, since there is no acceleration in that direction.) The forces parallel to
     the slope are the component of the skier's weight parallel to slope and friction f. Using Newton's second law,
     with subscripts to denote quantities parallel to the slope,

is the acceleration.

b. Include friction. We have a given value for friction, and we know its direction is parallel to the slope and it opposes
motion between surfaces in contact. So the net external force is

Substituting this into Newton's second law,  gives

We substitute known values to obtain

This gives us

which is the acceleration parallel to the incline when there is 45.0 N of opposing friction.
Significance
Since friction always opposes motion between surfaces, the acceleration is smaller when there is friction than when
there is none. It is a general result that if friction on an incline is negligible, then the acceleration down the incline is

               , regardless of mass. As discussed previously, all objects fall with the same acceleration in the absence of
air resistance. Similarly, all objects, regardless of mass, slide down a frictionless incline with the same acceleration
(if the angle is the same).

When an object rests on an incline that makes an angle with the horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the object
is divided into two components: a force acting perpendicular to the plane, , and a force acting parallel to the
plane, (Figure 5.23). The normal force is typically equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the

     We use the second equation to write the normal force experienced by an object resting on an inclined plane:

     object at rest or sliding on an inclined plane. Instead of memorizing these equations, it is helpful to be able to
     determine them from reason. To do this, we draw the right angle formed by the three weight vectors. The angle of
     the incline is the same as the angle formed between w and . Knowing this property, we can use trigonometry to
     determine the magnitude of the weight components:

     Tension
     A tension is a force along the length of a medium; in particular, it is a pulling force that acts along a stretched
     flexible connector, such as a rope or cable. The word "tension" comes from a Latin word meaning "to stretch." Not
     coincidentally, the flexible cords that carry muscle forces to other parts of the body are called tendons.
     Any flexible connector, such as a string, rope, chain, wire, or cable, can only exert a pull parallel to its length; thus, a
     force carried by a flexible connector is a tension with a direction parallel to the connector. Tension is a pull in a
     connector. Consider the phrase: "You can't push a rope." Instead, tension force pulls outward along the two ends of
     a rope.
     Consider a person holding a mass on a rope, as shown in Figure 5.24. If the 5.00-kg mass in the figure is stationary,
     then its acceleration is zero and the net force is zero. The only external forces acting on the mass are its weight and
     the tension supplied by the rope. Thus,

     where T and w are the magnitudes of the tension and weight, respectively, and their signs indicate direction, with up
     being positive. As we proved using Newton's second law, the tension equals the weight of the supported mass:

     object hanging at rest. Thus, for a 5.00-kg mass (neglecting the mass of the rope), we see that

     If we cut the rope and insert a spring, the spring would extend a length corresponding to a force of 49.0 N, providing
     a direct observation and measure of the tension force in the rope.

FIGURE 5.24 When a perfectly flexible connector (one requiring no force to bend it) such as this rope transmits a force that force must
be parallel to the length of the rope, as shown. By Newton's third law, the rope pulls with equal force but in opposite directions on the hand
and the supported mass (neglecting the weight of the rope). The rope is the medium that carries the equal and opposite forces between the
two objects. The tension anywhere in the rope between the hand and the mass is equal. Once you have determined the tension in one
location, you have determined the tension at all locations along the rope.

Flexible connectors are often used to transmit forces around corners, such as in a hospital traction system, a
tendon, or a bicycle brake cable. If there is no friction, the tension transmission is undiminished; only its direction
changes, and it is always parallel to the flexible connector, as shown in Figure 5.25.

FIGURE 5.25 (a) Tendons in the finger carry force T from the muscles to other parts of the finger, usually changing the force's direction but
not its magnitude (the tendons are relatively friction free). (b) The brake cable on a bicycle carries the tension T from the brake lever on the
handlebars to the brake mechanism. Again, the direction but not the magnitude of T is changed.

        EXAMPLE 5.13
What Is the Tension in a Tightrope?

Calculate the tension in the wire supporting the 70.0-kg tightrope walker shown in Figure 5.26.
224  5 · Newton's Laws of Motion

     FIGURE 5.26 The weight of a tightrope walker causes a wire to sag by  . The system of interest is the point in the wire at which the
     tightrope walker is standing.

     Strategy

     As you can see in Figure 5.26, the wire is bent under the person's weight. Thus, the tension on either side of the
     person has an upward component that can support his weight. As usual, forces are vectors represented pictorially
     by arrows that have the same direction as the forces and lengths proportional to their magnitudes. The system is the

     tightrope walker, and the only external forces acting on him are his weight and the two tensions (left tension)

     and (right tension). It is reasonable to neglect the weight of the wire. The net external force is zero, because the
     system is static. We can use trigonometry to find the tensions. One conclusion is possible at the outset--we can see
     from Figure 5.26(b) that the magnitudes of the tensions and must be equal. We know this because there is
     no horizontal acceleration in the rope and the only forces acting to the left and right are and . Thus, the
     magnitude of those horizontal components of the forces must be equal so that they cancel each other out.

     Whenever we have two-dimensional vector problems in which no two vectors are parallel, the easiest method of
     solution is to pick a convenient coordinate system and project the vectors onto its axes. In this case, the best
     coordinate system has one horizontal axis (x) and one vertical axis (y).

     Solution
     First, we need to resolve the tension vectors into their horizontal and vertical components. It helps to look at a new
     free-body diagram showing all horizontal and vertical components of each force acting on the system (Figure 5.27).

     FIGURE 5.27 When the vectors are projected onto vertical and horizontal axes, their components along these axes must add to zero, since
     the tightrope walker is stationary. The small angle results in T being much greater than w.

     Consider the horizontal components of the forces (denoted with a subscript x):

Now observe Figure 5.27. You can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude of and :

as predicted. Now, considering the vertical components (denoted by a subscript y), we can solve for T. Again, since

the person is stationary, Newton's second law implies that    . Thus, as illustrated in the free-body diagram,

We can use trigonometry to determine the relationships among  and T. As we determined from the

analysis in the horizontal direction,  :

Now we can substitute the vales for and , into the net force equation in the vertical direction:

and

so

and the tension is

Significance
The vertical tension in the wire acts as a force that supports the weight of the tightrope walker. The tension is almost
six times the 686-N weight of the tightrope walker. Since the wire is nearly horizontal, the vertical component of its
tension is only a fraction of the tension in the wire. The large horizontal components are in opposite directions and
cancel, so most of the tension in the wire is not used to support the weight of the tightrope walker.

If we wish to create a large tension, all we have to do is exert a force perpendicular to a taut flexible connector, as
226  5 · Newton's Laws of Motion

     illustrated in Figure 5.26. As we saw in Example 5.13, the weight of the tightrope walker acts as a force
     perpendicular to the rope. We saw that the tension in the rope is related to the weight of the tightrope walker in the
     following way:

     We can extend this expression to describe the tension T created when a perpendicular force   is exerted at the
     middle of a flexible connector:

     The angle between the horizontal and the bent connector is represented by . In this case, T becomes large as

     approaches zero. Even the relatively small weight of any flexible connector will cause it to sag, since an infinite

     tension would result if it were horizontal (i.e.,  and sin  ). For example, Figure 5.28 shows a situation

     where we wish to pull a car out of the mud when no tow truck is available. Each time the car moves forward, the

     chain is tightened to keep it as straight as possible. The tension in the chain is given by  and since is

     small, T is large. This situation is analogous to the tightrope walker, except that the tensions shown here are those
     transmitted to the car and the tree rather than those acting at the point where is applied.

     FIGURE 5.28 We can create a large tension in the chain--and potentially a big mess--by pushing on it perpendicular to its length, as shown.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 5.9

     One end of a 3.0-m rope is tied to a tree; the other end is tied to a car stuck in the mud. The motorist pulls sideways
     on the midpoint of the rope, displacing it a distance of 0.25 m. If he exerts a force of 200.0 N under these
     conditions, determine the force exerted on the car.

     In Applications of Newton's Laws, we extend the discussion on tension in a cable to include cases in which the
     angles shown are not equal.

     Friction
     Friction is a resistive force opposing motion or its tendency. Imagine an object at rest on a horizontal surface. The
     net force acting on the object must be zero, leading to equality of the weight and the normal force, which act in
     opposite directions. If the surface is tilted, the normal force balances the component of the weight perpendicular to
     the surface. If the object does not slide downward, the component of the weight parallel to the inclined plane is
     balanced by friction. Friction is discussed in greater detail in the next chapter.

     Spring force
     A spring is a special medium with a specific atomic structure that has the ability to restore its shape, if deformed. To
     restore its shape, a spring exerts a restoring force that is proportional to and in the opposite direction in which it is
     stretched or compressed. This is the statement of a law known as Hooke's law, which has the mathematical form

                                                                                                                                                          5.11

     The constant of proportionality k is a measure of the spring's stiffness. The line of action of this force is parallel to

     the spring axis, and the sense of the force is in the opposite direction of the displacement vector (Figure 5.29). The

     displacement must be measured from the relaxed position;    when the spring is relaxed.

Real Forces and Inertial Frames

There is another distinction among forces: Some forces are real, whereas others are not. Real forces have some
physical origin, such as a gravitational pull. In contrast, fictitious forces arise simply because an observer is in an
accelerating or noninertial frame of reference, such as one that rotates (like a merry-go-round) or undergoes linear
acceleration (like a car slowing down). For example, if a satellite is heading due north above Earth's Northern
Hemisphere, then to an observer on Earth, it will appear to experience a force to the west that has no physical origin.
Instead, Earth is rotating toward the east and moves east under the satellite. In Earth's frame, this looks like a
westward force on the satellite, or it can be interpreted as a violation of Newton's first law (the law of inertia). We
can identify a fictitious force by asking the question, "What is the reaction force?" If we cannot name the reaction
force, then the force we are considering is fictitious. In the example of the satellite, the reaction force would have to
be an eastward force on Earth. Recall that an inertial frame of reference is one in which all forces are real and,
equivalently, one in which Newton's laws have the simple forms given in this chapter.

Earth's rotation is slow enough that Earth is nearly an inertial frame. You ordinarily must perform precise
experiments to observe fictitious forces and the slight departures from Newton's laws, such as the effect just
described. On a large scale, such as for the rotation of weather systems and ocean currents, the effects can be easily
observed (Figure 5.30).

FIGURE 5.30 Hurricane Fran is shown heading toward the southeastern coast of the United States in September 1996. Notice the
characteristic "eye" shape of the hurricane. This is a result of the Coriolis effect, which is the deflection of objects (in this case, air) when
considered in a rotating frame of reference, like the spin of Earth. This hurricane shows a counter-clockwise rotation because it is a low
pressure storm. (credit "runner": modification of work by "Greenwich Photography"/Flickr)

The crucial factor in determining whether a frame of reference is inertial is whether it accelerates or rotates relative
to a known inertial frame. Unless stated otherwise, all phenomena discussed in this text are in inertial frames.

     The forces discussed in this section are real forces, but they are not the only real forces. Lift and thrust, for example,
     are more specialized real forces. In the long list of forces, are some more basic than others? Are some different
     manifestations of the same underlying force? The answer to both questions is yes, as you will see in the treatment of
     modern physics later in the text.

     5.7 Drawing Free-Body Diagrams

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the rules for drawing a free-body diagram
         · Construct free-body diagrams for different situations

     The first step in describing and analyzing most phenomena in physics involves the careful drawing of a free-body

     diagram. Free-body diagrams have been used in examples throughout this chapter. Remember that a free-body

     diagram must only include the external forces acting on the body of interest. Once we have drawn an accurate free-

     body diagram, we can apply Newton's first law if the body is in equilibrium (balanced forces; that is,  ) or

     Newton's second law if the body is accelerating (unbalanced force; that is,  ).

     In Forces, we gave a brief problem-solving strategy to help you understand free-body diagrams. Here, we add some
     details to the strategy that will help you in constructing these diagrams.

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Constructing Free-Body Diagrams

     Observe the following rules when constructing a free-body diagram:

       1. Draw the object under consideration; it does not have to be artistic. At first, you may want to draw a circle
             around the object of interest to be sure you focus on labeling the forces acting on the object. If you are
             treating the object as a particle (no size or shape and no rotation), represent the object as a point. We often
            place this point at the origin of an xy-coordinate system.

       2. Include all forces that act on the object, representing these forces as vectors. Consider the types of forces
             described in Common Forces--normal force, friction, tension, and spring force--as well as weight and applied
             force. Do not include the net force on the object. With the exception of gravity, all of the forces we have
             discussed require direct contact with the object. However, forces that the object exerts on its environment
             must not be included. We never include both forces of an action-reaction pair.

       3. Convert the free-body diagram into a more detailed diagram showing the x- and y-components of a given
             force (this is often helpful when solving a problem using Newton's first or second law). In this case, place a
            squiggly line through the original vector to show that it is no longer in play--it has been replaced by its x- and
            y-components.

       4. If there are two or more objects, or bodies, in the problem, draw a separate free-body diagram for each object.

5.7 · Drawing Free-Body Diagrams                                                                                                                  229

Note: If there is acceleration, we do not directly include it in the free-body diagram; however, it may help to indicate
acceleration outside the free-body diagram. You can label it in a different color to indicate that it is separate from
the free-body diagram.

Let's apply the problem-solving strategy in drawing a free-body diagram for a sled. In Figure 5.31(a), a sled is pulled
by force P at an angle of . In part (b), we show a free-body diagram for this situation, as described by steps 1 and
2 of the problem-solving strategy. In part (c), we show all forces in terms of their x- and y-components, in keeping
with step 3.

             FIGURE 5.31 (a) A moving sled is shown as (b) a free-body diagram and (c) a free-body diagram with force components.

        EXAMPLE 5.14

Two Blocks on an Inclined Plane

Construct the free-body diagram for object A and object B in Figure 5.32.
Strategy
We follow the four steps listed in the problem-solving strategy.
Solution
We start by creating a diagram for the first object of interest. In Figure 5.32(a), object A is isolated (circled) and
represented by a dot.

FIGURE 5.32 (a) The free-body diagram for isolated object A. (b) The free-body diagram for isolated object B. Comparing the two drawings,
we see that friction acts in the opposite direction in the two figures. Because object A experiences a force that tends to pull it to the right,
friction must act to the left. Because object B experiences a component of its weight that pulls it to the left, down the incline, the friction
force must oppose it and act up the ramp. Friction always acts opposite the intended direction of motion.
230  5 · Newton's Laws of Motion

     We now include any force that acts on the body. Here, no applied force is present. The weight of the object acts as a

     force pointing vertically downward, and the presence of the cord indicates a force of tension pointing away from the

     object. Object A has one interface and hence experiences a normal force, directed away from the interface. The

     source of this force is object B, and this normal force is labeled accordingly. Since object B has a tendency to slide

     down, object A has a tendency to slide up with respect to the interface, so the friction  is directed downward

     parallel to the inclined plane.

     As noted in step 4 of the problem-solving strategy, we then construct the free-body diagram in Figure 5.32(b) using

     the same approach. Object B experiences two normal forces and two friction forces due to the presence of two

     contact surfaces. The interface with the inclined plane exerts external forces of and , and the interface with

     object B exerts the normal force  and friction ;  is directed away from object B, and     is opposing

     the tendency of the relative motion of object B with respect to object A.

     Significance

     The object under consideration in each part of this problem was circled in gray. When you are first learning how to
     draw free-body diagrams, you will find it helpful to circle the object before deciding what forces are acting on that
     particular object. This focuses your attention, preventing you from considering forces that are not acting on the
     body.

     A force is applied to two blocks in contact, as shown. Draw the reaction forces between the two blocks.

        EXAMPLE 5.16

Block on the Table (Coupled Blocks)

A block rests on the table, as shown. A light rope is attached to it and runs over a pulley. The other end of the rope is
attached to a second block. The two blocks are said to be coupled. Block exerts a force due to its weight, which
causes the system (two blocks and a string) to accelerate.

Strategy
We assume that the string has no mass so that we do not have to consider it as a separate object. Draw a free-body
diagram for each block.

Solution

Significance

Each block accelerates (notice the labels shown for and ); however, assuming the string remains taut, the

magnitudes of acceleration are equal. Thus, we have  . If we were to continue solving the problem, we

could simply call the acceleration . Also, we use two free-body diagrams because we are usually finding tension T,

which may require us to use a system of two equations in this type of problem. The tension is the same on both

INTRODUCTION As a racecar moves in a curved path around the turn, its wheels also spin rapidly. The wheels
complete many revolutions while the car makes only part of one (a circular arc). How can we describe the velocities,
accelerations, and forces involved? What force keeps a racecar from spinning out, hitting the wall bordering the
track? What provides this force? Why is the track banked? We answer all of these questions in this chapter as we
expand our consideration of Newton's laws of motion.

6.1 Solving Problems with Newton's Laws

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Apply problem-solving techniques to solve for quantities in more complex systems of forces
    · Use concepts from kinematics to solve problems using Newton's laws of motion
    · Solve more complex equilibrium problems
    · Solve more complex acceleration problems
    · Apply calculus to more advanced dynamics problems
Success in problem solving is necessary to understand and apply physical principles. We developed a pattern of
analyzing and setting up the solutions to problems involving Newton's laws in Newton's Laws of Motion; in this
chapter, we continue to discuss these strategies and apply a step-by-step process.
248  6 · Applications of Newton's Laws

     Problem-Solving Strategies

     We follow here the basics of problem solving presented earlier in this text, but we emphasize specific strategies that
     are useful in applying Newton's laws of motion. Once you identify the physical principles involved in the problem and
     determine that they include Newton's laws of motion, you can apply these steps to find a solution. These techniques
     also reinforce concepts that are useful in many other areas of physics. Many problem-solving strategies are stated
     outright in the worked examples, so the following techniques should reinforce skills you have already begun to
     develop.

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Applying Newton's Laws of Motion

       1. Identify the physical principles involved by listing the givens and the quantities to be calculated.
       2. Sketch the situation, using arrows to represent all forces.
       3. Determine the system of interest. The result is a free-body diagram that is essential to solving the problem.
       4. Apply Newton's second law to solve the problem. If necessary, apply appropriate kinematic equations from

             the chapter on motion along a straight line.
       5. Check the solution to see whether it is reasonable.

     Let's apply this problem-solving strategy to the challenge of lifting a grand piano into a second-story apartment.
     Once we have determined that Newton's laws of motion are involved (if the problem involves forces), it is
     particularly important to draw a careful sketch of the situation. Such a sketch is shown in Figure 6.2(a). Then, as in
     Figure 6.2(b), we can represent all forces with arrows. Whenever sufficient information exists, it is best to label
     these arrows carefully and make the length and direction of each correspond to the represented force.

     FIGURE 6.2 (a) A grand piano is being lifted to a second-story apartment. (b) Arrows are used to represent all forces: is the tension in the

     rope above the piano, is the force that the piano exerts on the rope, and is the weight of the piano. All other forces, such as the nudge
     of a breeze, are assumed to be negligible. (c) Suppose we are given the piano's mass and asked to find the tension in the rope. We then

     define the system of interest as shown and draw a free-body diagram. Now is no longer shown, because it is not a force acting on the

     system of interest; rather, acts on the outside world. (d) Showing only the arrows, the head-to-tail method of addition is used. It is

     apparent that if the piano is stationary,  .

     As with most problems, we next need to identify what needs to be determined and what is known or can be inferred
     from the problem as stated, that is, make a list of knowns and unknowns. It is particularly crucial to identify the
     system of interest, since Newton's second law involves only external forces. We can then determine which forces
     are external and which are internal, a necessary step to employ Newton's second law. (See Figure 6.2(c).) Newton's
     third law may be used to identify whether forces are exerted between components of a system (internal) or between

the system and something outside (external). As illustrated in Newton's Laws of Motion, the system of interest
depends on the question we need to answer. Only forces are shown in free-body diagrams, not acceleration or
velocity. We have drawn several free-body diagrams in previous worked examples. Figure 6.2(c) shows a free-body
diagram for the system of interest. Note that no internal forces are shown in a free-body diagram.

Once a free-body diagram is drawn, we apply Newton's second law. This is done in Figure 6.2(d) for a particular
situation. In general, once external forces are clearly identified in free-body diagrams, it should be a straightforward
task to put them into equation form and solve for the unknown, as done in all previous examples. If the problem is
one-dimensional--that is, if all forces are parallel--then the forces can be handled algebraically. If the problem is
two-dimensional, then it must be broken down into a pair of one-dimensional problems. We do this by projecting the
force vectors onto a set of axes chosen for convenience. As seen in previous examples, the choice of axes can
simplify the problem. For example, when an incline is involved, a set of axes with one axis parallel to the incline and
one perpendicular to it is most convenient. It is almost always convenient to make one axis parallel to the direction
of motion, if this is known. Generally, just write Newton's second law in components along the different directions.
Then, you have the following equations:

(If, for example, the system is accelerating horizontally, then you can then set  ) We need this information to
determine unknown forces acting on a system.

As always, we must check the solution. In some cases, it is easy to tell whether the solution is reasonable. For
example, it is reasonable to find that friction causes an object to slide down an incline more slowly than when no
friction exists. In practice, intuition develops gradually through problem solving; with experience, it becomes
progressively easier to judge whether an answer is reasonable. Another way to check a solution is to check the units.
If we are solving for force and end up with units of millimeters per second, then we have made a mistake.

There are many interesting applications of Newton's laws of motion, a few more of which are presented in this
section. These serve also to illustrate some further subtleties of physics and to help build problem-solving skills. We
look first at problems involving particle equilibrium, which make use of Newton's first law, and then consider particle
acceleration, which involves Newton's second law.

Particle Equilibrium

Recall that a particle in equilibrium is one for which the external forces are balanced. Static equilibrium involves
objects at rest, and dynamic equilibrium involves objects in motion without acceleration, but it is important to
remember that these conditions are relative. For example, an object may be at rest when viewed from our frame of
reference, but the same object would appear to be in motion when viewed by someone moving at a constant
velocity. We now make use of the knowledge attained in Newton's Laws of Motion, regarding the different types of
forces and the use of free-body diagrams, to solve additional problems in particle equilibrium.

        EXAMPLE 6.1

Different Tensions at Different Angles

Consider the traffic light (mass of 15.0 kg) suspended from two wires as shown in Figure 6.3. Find the tension in
each wire, neglecting the masses of the wires.
250  6 · Applications of Newton's Laws

     FIGURE 6.3 A traffic light is suspended from two wires. (b) Some of the forces involved. (c) Only forces acting on the system are shown
     here. The free-body diagram for the traffic light is also shown. (d) The forces projected onto vertical (y) and horizontal (x) axes. The
     horizontal components of the tensions must cancel, and the sum of the vertical components of the tensions must equal the weight of the
     traffic light. (e) The free-body diagram shows the vertical and horizontal forces acting on the traffic light.

     Strategy
     The system of interest is the traffic light, and its free-body diagram is shown in Figure 6.3(c). The three forces
     involved are not parallel, and so they must be projected onto a coordinate system. The most convenient coordinate
     system has one axis vertical and one horizontal, and the vector projections on it are shown in Figure 6.3(d). There
     are two unknowns in this problem ( and ), so two equations are needed to find them. These two equations
     come from applying Newton's second law along the vertical and horizontal axes, noting that the net external force is
     zero along each axis because acceleration is zero.
     Solution
     First consider the horizontal or x-axis:

     Thus, as you might expect,

     This gives us the following relationship:

Now consider the force components along the vertical or y-axis:

This implies

Substituting the expressions for the vertical components gives

There are two unknowns in this equation, but substituting the expression for  in terms of  reduces this to one
equation with one unknown:

which yields

Solving this last equation gives the magnitude of to be

Finally, we find the magnitude of  by using the relationship between them,                 , found above. Thus we
obtain

Significance
Both tensions would be larger if both wires were more horizontal, and they will be equal if and only if the angles on
either side are the same (as they were in the earlier example of a tightrope walker in Newton's Laws of Motion.

Particle Acceleration

We have given a variety of examples of particles in equilibrium. We now turn our attention to particle acceleration
problems, which are the result of a nonzero net force. Refer again to the steps given at the beginning of this section,
and notice how they are applied to the following examples.

EXAMPLE 6.2

Drag Force on a Barge

Two tugboats push on a barge at different angles (Figure 6.4). The first tugboat exerts a force of              in the

x-direction, and the second tugboat exerts a force of             in the y-direction. The mass of the barge is

              and its acceleration is observed to be              in the direction shown. What is the drag force

of the water on the barge resisting the motion? (Note: Drag force is a frictional force exerted by fluids, such as air or

water. The drag force opposes the motion of the object. Since the barge is flat bottomed, we can assume that the

drag force is in the direction opposite of motion of the barge.)
252  6 · Applications of Newton's Laws

     FIGURE 6.4 (a) A view from above of two tugboats pushing on a barge. (b) The free-body diagram for the ship contains only forces acting in
     the plane of the water. It omits the two vertical forces--the weight of the barge and the buoyant force of the water supporting it cancel and

     are not shown. Note that  is the total applied force of the tugboats.

     Strategy

     The directions and magnitudes of acceleration and the applied forces are given in Figure 6.4(a). We define the total

     force of the tugboats on the barge as     so that

     The drag of the water is in the direction opposite to the direction of motion of the boat; this force thus works

     against        as shown in the free-body diagram in Figure 6.4(b). The system of interest here is the barge, since the

     forces on it are given as well as its acceleration. Because the applied forces are perpendicular, the x- and y-axes are

     in the same direction as and The problem quickly becomes a one-dimensional problem along the direction of

     , since friction is in the direction opposite to   Our strategy is to find the magnitude and direction of the net

     applied force      and then apply Newton's second law to solve for the drag force

     The angle is given by

     From Newton's first law, we know this is the same direction as the acceleration. We also know that is in the

     opposite direction of     since it acts to slow down the acceleration. Therefore, the net external force is in the

     same direction as         but its magnitude is slightly less than      The problem is now one-dimensional. From the

     free-body diagram, we can see that

     However, Newton's second law states that

This can be solved for the magnitude of the drag force of the water in terms of known quantities:
Substituting known values gives

The direction of  has already been determined to be in the direction opposite to  or at an angle of south
of west.

Significance

The numbers used in this example are reasonable for a moderately large barge. It is certainly difficult to obtain
larger accelerations with tugboats, and small speeds are desirable to avoid running the barge into the docks. Drag is
relatively small for a well-designed hull at low speeds, consistent with the answer to this example, where is less
than 1/600th of the weight of the ship.

In Newton's Laws of Motion, we discussed the normal force, which is a contact force that acts normal to the surface
so that an object does not have an acceleration perpendicular to the surface. The bathroom scale is an excellent
example of a normal force acting on a body. It provides a quantitative reading of how much it must push upward to
support the weight of an object. But can you predict what you would see on the dial of a bathroom scale if you stood
on it during an elevator ride? Will you see a value greater than your weight when the elevator starts up? What about
when the elevator moves upward at a constant speed? Take a guess before reading the next example.

EXAMPLE 6.3

What Does the Bathroom Scale Read in an Elevator?

Figure 6.5 shows a 75.0-kg man (weight of about 165 lb.) standing on a bathroom scale in an elevator. Calculate the

scale reading: (a) if the elevator accelerates upward at a rate of  and (b) if the elevator moves upward at a

     upward on the scale. (b) The free-body diagram shows only the external forces acting on the designated system of interest--the
     person--and is the diagram we use for the solution of the problem.

     Strategy

     If the scale at rest is accurate, its reading equals , the magnitude of the force the person exerts downward on it.
     Figure 6.5(a) shows the numerous forces acting on the elevator, scale, and person. It makes this one-dimensional
     problem look much more formidable than if the person is chosen to be the system of interest and a free-body
     diagram is drawn, as in Figure 6.5(b). Analysis of the free-body diagram using Newton's laws can produce answers
     to both Figure 6.5(a) and (b) of this example, as well as some other questions that might arise. The only forces

     acting on the person are his weight and the upward force of the scale According to Newton's third law, and

         are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so that we need to find  in order to find what the scale reads.
     We can do this, as usual, by applying Newton's second law,

     From the free-body diagram, we see that  so we have

No assumptions were made about the acceleration, so this solution should be valid for a variety of accelerations in

addition to those in this situation. (Note: We are considering the case when the elevator is accelerating upward. If

the elevator is accelerating downward, Newton's second law becomes  )

Solution

b. Now, what happens when the elevator reaches a constant upward velocity? Will the scale still read more than

his weight? For any constant velocity--up, down, or stationary--acceleration is zero because  and

            Thus,

or

        which gives

Significance
The scale reading in Figure 6.5(a) is about 185 lb. What would the scale have read if he were stationary? Since his
acceleration would be zero, the force of the scale would be equal to his weight:

Thus, the scale reading in the elevator is greater than his 735-N (165-lb.) weight. This means that the scale is
pushing up on the person with a force greater than his weight, as it must in order to accelerate him upward. Clearly,
the greater the acceleration of the elevator, the greater the scale reading, consistent with what you feel in rapidly
accelerating versus slowly accelerating elevators. In Figure 6.5(b), the scale reading is 735 N, which equals the
person's weight. This is the case whenever the elevator has a constant velocity--moving up, moving down, or
stationary.

The solution to the previous example also applies to an elevator accelerating downward, as mentioned. When an
elevator accelerates downward, a is negative, and the scale reading is less than the weight of the person. If a
constant downward velocity is reached, the scale reading again becomes equal to the person's weight. If the
elevator is in free fall and accelerating downward at g, then the scale reading is zero and the person appears to be
weightless.

     Strategy
     We draw a free-body diagram for each mass separately, as shown in Figure 6.6. Then we analyze each one to find
     the required unknowns. The forces on block 1 are the gravitational force, the contact force of the surface, and the
     tension in the string. Block 2 is subjected to the gravitational force and the string tension. Newton's second law
     applies to each, so we write two vector equations:

     For block 1:

     For block 2:

     Notice that is the same for both blocks. Since the string and the pulley have negligible mass, and since there is no
     friction in the pulley, the tension is the same throughout the string. We can now write component equations for each
     block. All forces are either horizontal or vertical, so we can use the same horizontal/vertical coordinate system for
     both objects

     Solution
     The component equations follow from the vector equations above. We see that block 1 has the vertical forces
     balanced, so we ignore them and write an equation relating the x-components. There are no horizontal forces on
     block 2, so only the y-equation is written. We obtain these results:

     When block 1 moves to the right, block 2 travels an equal distance downward; thus,  Writing the

     Newton's Laws of Motion and Kinematics

     Physics is most interesting and most powerful when applied to general situations that involve more than a narrow
     set of physical principles. Newton's laws of motion can also be integrated with other concepts that have been
     discussed previously in this text to solve problems of motion. For example, forces produce accelerations, a topic of
     kinematics, and hence the relevance of earlier chapters.

     When approaching problems that involve various types of forces, acceleration, velocity, and/or position, listing the
     givens and the quantities to be calculated will allow you to identify the principles involved. Then, you can refer to the
     chapters that deal with a particular topic and solve the problem using strategies outlined in the text. The following
     worked example illustrates how the problem-solving strategy given earlier in this chapter, as well as strategies
     presented in other chapters, is applied to an integrated concept problem.

     EXAMPLE 6.6

     What Force Must a Soccer Player Exert to Reach Top Speed?

     A soccer player starts at rest and accelerates forward, reaching a velocity of 8.00 m/s in 2.50 s. (a) What is her
     average acceleration? (b) What average force does the ground exert forward on the runner so that she achieves this
     acceleration? The player's mass is 70.0 kg, and air resistance is negligible.

     Strategy

     To find the answers to this problem, we use the problem-solving strategy given earlier in this chapter. The solutions
     to each part of the example illustrate how to apply specific problem-solving steps. In this case, we do not need to
     use all of the steps. We simply identify the physical principles, and thus the knowns and unknowns; apply Newton's
     second law; and check to see whether the answer is reasonable.

     Solution

     a. We are given the initial and final velocities (zero and 8.00 m/s forward); thus, the change in velocity is

                   . We are given the elapsed time, so  The unknown is acceleration, which can be

     found from its definition:

Substituting the known values yields

  b. Here we are asked to find the average force the ground exerts on the runner to produce this acceleration.
        (Remember that we are dealing with the force or forces acting on the object of interest.) This is the reaction
        force to that exerted by the player backward against the ground, by Newton's third law. Neglecting air
        resistance, this would be equal in magnitude to the net external force on the player, since this force causes her
        acceleration. Since we now know the player's acceleration and are given her mass, we can use Newton's
        second law to find the force exerted. That is,

       Substituting the known values of m and a gives

This is a reasonable result: The acceleration is attainable for an athlete in good condition. The force is about 50
pounds, a reasonable average force.

Significance
This example illustrates how to apply problem-solving strategies to situations that include topics from different
chapters. The first step is to identify the physical principles, the knowns, and the unknowns involved in the problem.
The second step is to solve for the unknown, in this case using Newton's second law. Finally, we check our answer to
ensure it is reasonable. These techniques for integrated concept problems will be useful in applications of physics
outside of a physics course, such as in your profession, in other science disciplines, and in everyday life.

        of motion

When a body is in motion, it has resistance because the body interacts with its surroundings. This resistance is a
force of friction. Friction opposes relative motion between systems in contact but also allows us to move, a concept
that becomes obvious if you try to walk on ice. Friction is a common yet complex force, and its behavior still not
completely understood. Still, it is possible to understand the circumstances in which it behaves.

Static and Kinetic Friction

The basic definition of friction is relatively simple to state.

  FRICTION

  Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between systems in contact.

There are several forms of friction. One of the simpler characteristics of sliding friction is that it is parallel to the
contact surfaces between systems and is always in a direction that opposes motion or attempted motion of the
systems relative to each other. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction
between them is called kinetic friction. For example, friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice. When objects are
stationary, static friction can act between them; the static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between
two objects.

  STATIC AND KINETIC FRICTION

  If two systems are in contact and stationary relative to one another, then the friction between them is called
  static friction. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them
  is called kinetic friction.

Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floor--you might push very hard on the crate
and not move it at all. This means that the static friction responds to what you do--it increases to be equal to and in
the opposite direction of your push. If you finally push hard enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and starts to
move. Now static friction gives way to kinetic friction. Once in motion, it is easier to keep it in motion than it was to
get it started, indicating that the kinetic frictional force is less than the static frictional force. If you add mass to the
crate, say by placing a box on top of it, you need to push even harder to get it started and also to keep it moving.
Furthermore, if you oiled the concrete you would find it easier to get the crate started and keep it going (as you
might expect).

Figure 6.10 is a crude pictorial representation of how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Close-up
inspection of these surfaces shows them to be rough. Thus, when you push to get an object moving (in this case, a
crate), you must raise the object until it can skip along with just the tips of the surface hitting, breaking off the
points, or both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. The harder the surfaces
are pushed together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force is needed to move them. Part of
the friction is due to adhesive forces between the surface molecules of the two objects, which explains the
dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. For example, rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with
leather soles. Adhesion varies with substances in contact and is a complicated aspect of surface physics. Once an
object is moving, there are fewer points of contact (fewer molecules adhering), so less force is required to keep the
object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed.
264  6 · Applications of Newton's Laws

     FIGURE 6.10 Frictional forces, such as always oppose motion or attempted motion between objects in contact. Friction arises in part
     because of the roughness of the surfaces in contact, as seen in the expanded view. For the object to move, it must rise to where the peaks
     of the top surface can skip along the bottom surface. Thus, a force is required just to set the object in motion. Some of the peaks will be
     broken off, also requiring a force to maintain motion. Much of the friction is actually due to attractive forces between molecules making up
     the two objects, so that even perfectly smooth surfaces are not friction-free. (In fact, perfectly smooth, clean surfaces of similar materials
     would adhere, forming a bond called a "cold weld.")

     The magnitude of the frictional force has two forms: one for static situations (static friction), the other for situations
     involving motion (kinetic friction). What follows is an approximate empirical (experimentally determined) model
     only. These equations for static and kinetic friction are not vector equations.

     limit. Once the applied force exceeds

TABLE 6.1 Approximate Coefficients of Static and Kinetic Friction
266  6 · Applications of Newton's Laws

     Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2 include the dependence of friction on materials and the normal force. The direction of
     friction is always opposite that of motion, parallel to the surface between objects, and perpendicular to the normal
     force. For example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the floor) has a mass of 100 kg, then the
     normal force is equal to its weight,

     perpendicular to the floor. If the coefficient of static friction is 0.45, you would have to exert a force parallel to the
     floor greater than

     to move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and the coefficient of kinetic friction might be 0.30, so that a
     force of only

     keeps it moving at a constant speed. If the floor is lubricated, both coefficients are considerably less than they
     would be without lubrication. Coefficient of friction is a unitless quantity with a magnitude usually between 0 and
     1.0. The actual value depends on the two surfaces that are in contact.

     Many people have experienced the slipperiness of walking on ice. However, many parts of the body, especially the

     ends of two bones, which are connected by thick tissues. The knee joint is formed by the lower leg bone (the tibia)
     and the thighbone (the femur). The hip is a ball (at the end of the femur) and socket (part of the pelvis) joint. The
     ends of the bones in the joint are covered by cartilage, which provides a smooth, almost-glassy surface. The joints
     also produce a fluid (synovial fluid) that reduces friction and wear. A damaged or arthritic joint can be replaced by an
     artificial joint (Figure 6.12). These replacements can be made of metals (stainless steel or titanium) or plastic
     (polyethylene), also with very small coefficients of friction.

     Natural lubricants include saliva produced in our mouths to aid in the swallowing process, and the slippery mucus
     found between organs in the body, allowing them to move freely past each other during heartbeats, during
     breathing, and when a person moves. Hospitals and doctor's clinics commonly use artificial lubricants, such as gels,
     to reduce friction.
     The equations given for static and kinetic friction are empirical laws that describe the behavior of the forces of
     friction. While these formulas are very useful for practical purposes, they do not have the status of mathematical
     statements that represent general principles (e.g., Newton's second law). In fact, there are cases for which these
     equations are not even good approximations. For instance, neither formula is accurate for lubricated surfaces or for
     two surfaces sliding across each other at high speeds. Unless specified, we will not be concerned with these

Static and Kinetic Friction

A 20.0-kg crate is at rest on a floor as shown in Figure 6.13. The coefficient of static friction between the crate and

floor is 0.700 and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.600. A horizontal force is applied to the crate. Find the

     matches the applied force, until we reach the maximum value of static friction. Also, no motion can occur until the
     applied force equals the force of static friction, but the force of kinetic friction will then become smaller.

     Friction and the Inclined Plane

     One situation where friction plays an obvious role is that of an object on a slope. It might be a crate being pushed up
     a ramp to a loading dock or a skateboarder coasting down a mountain, but the basic physics is the same. We usually
     generalize the sloping surface and call it an inclined plane but then pretend that the surface is flat. Let's look at an
     example of analyzing motion on an inclined plane with friction.

     EXAMPLE 6.11

     Downhill Skier

     A skier with a mass of 62 kg is sliding down a snowy slope at a constant acceleration. Find the coefficient of kinetic
     friction for the skier if friction is known to be 45.0 N.

     Strategy

     The magnitude of kinetic friction is given as 45.0 N. Kinetic friction is related to the normal force by                 ;

     thus, we can find the coefficient of kinetic friction if we can find the normal force on the skier. The normal force is

     always perpendicular to the surface, and since there is no motion perpendicular to the surface, the normal force

     should equal the component of the skier's weight perpendicular to the slope. (See Figure 6.14, which repeats a

     figure from the chapter on Newton's laws of motion.)

     FIGURE 6.14 The motion of the skier and friction are parallel to the slope, so it is most convenient to project all forces onto a coordinate
     system where one axis is parallel to the slope and the other is perpendicular (axes shown to left of skier). The normal force is
     perpendicular to the slope, and friction is parallel to the slope, but the skier's weight has components along both axes, namely and

           The normal force is equal in magnitude to so there is no motion perpendicular to the slope.

Substituting this into our expression for kinetic friction, we obtain

which can now be solved for the coefficient of kinetic friction

Solution       gives
Solving for

Substituting known values on the right-hand side of the equation,

Significance

This result is a little smaller than the coefficient listed in Table 6.1 for waxed wood on snow, but it is still reasonable

since values of the coefficients of friction can vary greatly. In situations like this, where an object of mass m slides

down a slope that makes an angle with the horizontal, friction is given by          All objects slide down

a slope with constant acceleration under these circumstances.

We have discussed that when an object rests on a horizontal surface, the normal force supporting it is equal in
magnitude to its weight. Furthermore, simple friction is always proportional to the normal force. When an object is
not on a horizontal surface, as with the inclined plane, we must find the force acting on the object that is directed
perpendicular to the surface; it is a component of the weight.

We now derive a useful relationship for calculating coefficient of friction on an inclined plane. Notice that the result
applies only for situations in which the object slides at constant speed down the ramp.

An object slides down an inclined plane at a constant velocity if the net force on the object is zero. We can use this

fact to measure the coefficient of kinetic friction between two objects. As shown in Example 6.11, the kinetic friction

on a slope is             . The component of the weight down the slope is equal to  (see the free-body

diagram in Figure 6.14). These forces act in opposite directions, so when they have equal magnitude, the

acceleration is zero. Writing these out,

Solving for we find that

Put a coin on a book and tilt it until the coin slides at a constant velocity down the book. You might need to tap the
book lightly to get the coin to move. Measure the angle of tilt relative to the horizontal and find Note that the
coin does not start to slide at all until an angle greater than is attained, since the coefficient of static friction is
larger than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Think about how this may affect the value for and its uncertainty.

Atomic-Scale Explanations of Friction

The simpler aspects of friction dealt with so far are its macroscopic (large-scale) characteristics. Great strides have
been made in the atomic-scale explanation of friction during the past several decades. Researchers are finding that
the atomic nature of friction seems to have several fundamental characteristics. These characteristics not only
explain some of the simpler aspects of friction--they also hold the potential for the development of nearly friction-
free environments that could save hundreds of billions of dollars in energy which is currently being converted
(unnecessarily) into heat.

Figure 6.15 illustrates one macroscopic characteristic of friction that is explained by microscopic (small-scale)
270  6 · Applications of Newton's Laws

     research. We have noted that friction is proportional to the normal force, but not to the amount of area in contact, a
     somewhat counterintuitive notion. When two rough surfaces are in contact, the actual contact area is a tiny fraction
     of the total area because only high spots touch. When a greater normal force is exerted, the actual contact area
     increases, and we find that the friction is proportional to this area.

     FIGURE 6.15 Two rough surfaces in contact have a much smaller area of actual contact than their total area. When the normal force is
     larger as a result of a larger applied force, the area of actual contact increases, as does friction.

     However, the atomic-scale view promises to explain far more than the simpler features of friction. The mechanism
     for how heat is generated is now being determined. In other words, why do surfaces get warmer when rubbed?
     Essentially, atoms are linked with one another to form lattices. When surfaces rub, the surface atoms adhere and
     cause atomic lattices to vibrate--essentially creating sound waves that penetrate the material. The sound waves
     diminish with distance, and their energy is converted into heat. Chemical reactions that are related to frictional wear
     can also occur between atoms and molecules on the surfaces. Figure 6.16 shows how the tip of a probe drawn
     across another material is deformed by atomic-scale friction. The force needed to drag the tip can be measured and
     is found to be related to shear stress, which is discussed in Static Equilibrium and Elasticity. The variation in shear
     stress is remarkable (more than a factor of ) and difficult to predict theoretically, but shear stress is yielding a
     fundamental understanding of a large-scale phenomenon known since ancient times--friction.

     FIGURE 6.16 The tip of a probe is deformed sideways by frictional force as the probe is dragged across a surface. Measurements of how the
     force varies for different materials are yielding fundamental insights into the atomic nature of friction.

Sliding Blocks

The two blocks of Figure 6.17 are attached to each other by a massless string that is wrapped around a frictionless
pulley. When the bottom 4.00-kg block is pulled to the left by the constant force the top 2.00-kg block slides
across it to the right. Find the magnitude of the force necessary to move the blocks at constant speed. Assume that
the coefficient of kinetic friction between all surfaces is 0.400.

          FIGURE 6.17 (a) Each block moves at constant velocity. (b) Free-body diagrams for the blocks.

Strategy

We analyze the motions of the two blocks separately. The top block is subjected to a contact force exerted by the

bottom block. The components of this force are the normal force and the frictional force                 Other

forces on the top block are the tension in the string and the weight of the top block itself, 19.6 N. The bottom

block is subjected to contact forces due to the top block and due to the floor. The first contact force has components

and       which are simply reaction forces to the contact forces that the bottom block exerts on the top

block. The components of the contact force of the floor are and              Other forces on this block are the

tension and the weight -39.2 N.

Solution
Since the top block is moving horizontally to the right at constant velocity, its acceleration is zero in both the
horizontal and the vertical directions. From Newton's second law,

Solving for the two unknowns, we obtain  and                                 The bottom block is also not

                 FIGURE 6.18 (a) A crate rests on the bed of the truck that is accelerating forward. (b) The free-body diagram of the crate.

     Strategy
     The forces on the crate are its weight and the normal and frictional forces due to contact with the truck bed. We
     start by assuming that the crate is not slipping. In this case, the static frictional force acts on the crate.
     Furthermore, the accelerations of the crate and the truck are equal.

     Solution

       a. Application of Newton's second law to the crate, using the reference frame attached to the ground, yields

          We can now check the validity of our no-slip assumption. The maximum value of the force of static friction is

FIGURE 6.19 (a) A snowboarder glides down a slope inclined at 13° to the horizontal. (b) The free-body diagram of the snowboarder.

Strategy

The forces acting on the snowboarder are her weight and the contact force of the slope, which has a component

normal to the incline and a component along the incline (force of kinetic friction). Because she moves along the

slope, the most convenient reference frame for analyzing her motion is one with the x-axis along and the y-axis

perpendicular to the incline. In this frame, both the normal and the frictional forces lie along coordinate axes, the

     6.3 Centripetal Force

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the equation for centripetal acceleration
         · Apply Newton's second law to develop the equation for centripetal force
         · Use circular motion concepts in solving problems involving Newton's laws of motion

     In Motion in Two and Three Dimensions, we examined the basic concepts of circular motion. An object undergoing
     circular motion, like one of the race cars shown at the beginning of this chapter, must be accelerating because it is
     changing the direction of its velocity. We proved that this centrally directed acceleration, called centripetal
     acceleration, is given by the formula

     where v is the velocity of the object, directed along a tangent line to the curve at any instant. If we know the angular
     velocity , then we can use

     Angular velocity gives the rate at which the object is turning through the curve, in units of rad/s. This acceleration
     acts along the radius of the curved path and is thus also referred to as a radial acceleration.

     An acceleration must be produced by a force. Any force or combination of forces can cause a centripetal or radial

     acceleration. Just a few examples are the tension in the rope on a tether ball, the force of Earth's gravity on the

     Moon, friction between roller skates and a rink floor, a banked roadway's force on a car, and forces on the tube of a

     spinning centrifuge. Any net force causing uniform circular motion is called a centripetal force. The direction of a

     centripetal force is toward the center of curvature, the same as the direction of centripetal acceleration. According

     to Newton's second law of motion, net force is mass times acceleration:  For uniform circular motion, the

     acceleration is the centripetal acceleration:.  Thus, the magnitude of centripetal force is

     By substituting the expressions for centripetal acceleration             we get two expressions for the

     centripetal force in terms of mass, velocity, angular velocity, and radius of curvature:

                                                                                                                          6.3

     You may use whichever expression for centripetal force is more convenient. Centripetal force is always
     perpendicular to the path and points to the center of curvature, because is perpendicular to the velocity and
     points to the center of curvature. Note that if you solve the first expression for r, you get

     This implies that for a given mass and velocity, a large centripetal force causes a small radius of curvature--that is, a
     tight curve, as in Figure 6.20.

FIGURE 6.20 The frictional force supplies the centripetal force and is numerically equal to it. Centripetal force is perpendicular to velocity

has the same v, but a larger produces a smaller r.

What Coefficient of Friction Do Cars Need on a Flat Curve?

(a) Calculate the centripetal force exerted on a 900.0-kg car that negotiates a 500.0-m radius curve at 25.00 m/s.
(b) Assuming an unbanked curve, find the minimum static coefficient of friction between the tires and the road,
static friction being the reason that keeps the car from slipping (Figure 6.21).

FIGURE 6.21 This car on level ground is moving away and turning to the left. The centripetal force causing the car to turn in a circular path
is due to friction between the tires and the road. A minimum coefficient of friction is needed, or the car will move in a larger-radius curve
and leave the roadway.

     Strategy                           Thus,
       a. We know that

     b. Figure 6.21 shows the forces acting on the car on an unbanked (level ground) curve. Friction is to the left,

     keeping the car from slipping, and because it is the only horizontal force acting on the car, the friction is the

     centripetal force in this case. We know that the maximum static friction (at which the tires roll but do not slip)

     is            where is the static coefficient of friction and N is the normal force. The normal force equals the

     car's weight on level ground, so          Thus the centripetal force in this situation is

     Now we have a relationship between centripetal force and the coefficient of friction. Using the equation

     we obtain

     We solve this for noting that mass cancels, and obtain

     Substituting the knowns,

     (Because coefficients of friction are approximate, the answer is given to only two digits.)

     Significance

     The coefficient of friction found in Figure 6.21(b) is much smaller than is typically found between tires and roads.

     The car still negotiates the curve if the coefficient is greater than 0.13, because static friction is a responsive force,

     able to assume a value less than but no more than  A higher coefficient would also allow the car to negotiate

     the curve at a higher speed, but if the coefficient of friction is less, the safe speed would be less than 25 m/s. Note

     that mass cancels, implying that, in this example, it does not matter how heavily loaded the car is to negotiate the

     turn. Mass cancels because friction is assumed proportional to the normal force, which in turn is proportional to

     mass. If the surface of the road were banked, the normal force would be greater, as discussed next.

     Banked Curves

     Let us now consider banked curves, where the slope of the road helps you negotiate the curve (Figure 6.22). The
     greater the angle , the faster you can take the curve. Race tracks for bikes as well as cars, for example, often have
     steeply banked curves. In an "ideally banked curve," the angle is such that you can negotiate the curve at a certain
     speed without the aid of friction between the tires and the road. We will derive an expression for for an ideally
     banked curve and consider an example related to it.

              FIGURE 6.22 The car on this banked curve is moving away and turning to the left.

For ideal banking, the net external force equals the horizontal centripetal force in the absence of friction. The
components of the normal force N in the horizontal and vertical directions must equal the centripetal force and the
weight of the car, respectively. In cases in which forces are not parallel, it is most convenient to consider
components along perpendicular axes--in this case, the vertical and horizontal directions.

Figure 6.22 shows a free-body diagram for a car on a frictionless banked curve. If the angle is ideal for the speed
and radius, then the net external force equals the necessary centripetal force. The only two external forces acting on

the car are its weight and the normal force of the road (A frictionless surface can only exert a force
perpendicular to the surface--that is, a normal force.) These two forces must add to give a net external force that is

horizontal toward the center of curvature and has magnitude    Because this is the crucial force and it is

horizontal, we use a coordinate system with vertical and horizontal axes. Only the normal force has a horizontal

component, so this must equal the centripetal force, that is,

Because the car does not leave the surface of the road, the net vertical force must be zero, meaning that the vertical

components of the two external forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. From Figure 6.22, we

see that the vertical component of the normal force is         and the only other vertical force is the car's weight.

These must be equal in magnitude; thus,

Now we can combine these two equations to eliminate N and get an expression for , as desired. Solving the second

equation for  and substituting this into the first yields

Taking the inverse tangent gives

                                                                                                                                                       6.4

This expression can be understood by considering how depends on v and r. A large is obtained for a large v and a
small r. That is, roads must be steeply banked for high speeds and sharp curves. Friction helps, because it allows
you to take the curve at greater or lower speed than if the curve were frictionless. Note that does not depend on
the mass of the vehicle.

     Curves on some test tracks and race courses, such as Daytona International Speedway in Florida, are very steeply

     banked. This banking, with the aid of tire friction and very stable car configurations, allows the curves to be taken at

     very high speed. To illustrate, calculate the speed at which a 100.0-m radius curve banked at  should be driven

     if the road were frictionless.

     Strategy
     We first note that all terms in the expression for the ideal angle of a banked curve except for speed are known; thus,
     we need only rearrange it so that speed appears on the left-hand side and then substitute known quantities.

     Solution
     Starting with

     we get                             we obtain
     Noting that

     Significance
     This is just about 87.5 km/h, consistent with a very steeply banked and rather sharp curve. Tire friction enables a
     vehicle to take the curve at significantly higher speeds.

     Airplanes also make turns by banking. The lift force, due to the force of the air on the wing, acts at right angles to the
     wing. When the airplane banks, the pilot is obtaining greater lift than necessary for level flight. The vertical
     component of lift balances the airplane's weight, and the horizontal component accelerates the plane. The banking
     angle shown in Figure 6.23 is given by . We analyze the forces in the same way we treat the case of the car
     rounding a banked curve.

     FIGURE 6.23 In a banked turn, the horizontal component of lift is unbalanced and accelerates the plane. The normal component of lift
     balances the plane's weight. The banking angle is given by . Compare the vector diagram with that shown in Figure 6.22.

Join the ladybug (https://openstax.org/l/21ladybug_es) in an exploration of rotational motion. Rotate the merry-go-
round to change its angle or choose a constant angular velocity or angular acceleration. Explore how circular motion
relates to the bug's xy-position, velocity, and acceleration using vectors or graphs.

     INTERACTIVE

A circular motion requires a force, the so-called centripetal force, which is directed to the axis of rotation. This
simplified model of a carousel (https://openstax.org/l/21carousel) demonstrates this force.

Inertial Forces and Noninertial (Accelerated) Frames: The Coriolis Force

What do taking off in a jet airplane, turning a corner in a car, riding a merry-go-round, and the circular motion of a
tropical cyclone have in common? Each exhibits inertial forces--fictitious forces that merely seem to arise from
motion, because the observer's frame of reference is accelerating or rotating. When taking off in a jet, most people
would agree it feels as if you are being pushed back into the seat as the airplane accelerates down the runway. Yet a
physicist would say that you tend to remain stationary while the seat pushes forward on you. An even more common
experience occurs when you make a tight curve in your car--say, to the right (Figure 6.24). You feel as if you are
thrown (that is, forced) toward the left relative to the car. Again, a physicist would say that you are going in a straight
line (recall Newton's first law) but the car moves to the right, not that you are experiencing a force from the left.

FIGURE 6.24 (a) The car driver feels herself forced to the left relative to the car when she makes a right turn. This is a fictitious inertial force
arising from the use of the car as a frame of reference. (b) In Earth's frame of reference, the driver moves in a straight line, obeying
Newton's first law, and the car moves to the right. There is no force to the left on the driver relative to Earth. Instead, there is a force to the
right on the car to make it turn.

We can reconcile these points of view by examining the frames of reference used. Let us concentrate on people in a
car. Passengers instinctively use the car as a frame of reference, whereas a physicist might use Earth. The physicist
might make this choice because Earth is nearly an inertial frame of reference, in which all forces have an identifiable
physical origin. In such a frame of reference, Newton's laws of motion take the form given in Newton's Laws of
Motion. The car is a noninertial frame of reference because it is accelerated to the side. The force to the left sensed
by car passengers is an inertial force having no physical origin (it is due purely to the inertia of the passenger, not to
some physical cause such as tension, friction, or gravitation). The car, as well as the driver, is actually accelerating to
the right.

A physicist will choose whatever reference frame is most convenient for the situation being analyzed. There is no
problem to a physicist in including inertial forces and Newton's second law, as usual, if that is more convenient, for

     example, on a merry-go-round or on a rotating planet. Noninertial (accelerated) frames of reference are used when
     it is useful to do so. Different frames of reference must be considered in discussing the motion of an astronaut in a
     spacecraft traveling at speeds near the speed of light, as you will appreciate in the study of the special theory of
     relativity.

     Let us now take a mental ride on a merry-go-round--specifically, a rapidly rotating playground merry-go-round
     (Figure 6.25). You take the merry-go-round to be your frame of reference because you rotate together. When
     rotating in that noninertial frame of reference, you feel an inertial force that tends to throw you off; this is often
     referred to as a centrifugal force (not to be confused with centripetal force). Centrifugal force is a commonly used
     term, but it does not actually exist. You must hang on tightly to counteract your inertia (which people often refer to
     as centrifugal force). In Earth's frame of reference, there is no force trying to throw you off; we emphasize that
     centrifugal force is a fiction. You must hang on to make yourself go in a circle because otherwise you would go in a
     straight line, right off the merry-go-round, in keeping with Newton's first law. But the force you exert acts toward the
     center of the circle.

     FIGURE 6.25 (a) A rider on a merry-go-round feels as if he is being thrown off. This inertial force is sometimes mistakenly called the

     centrifugal force in an effort to explain the rider's motion in the rotating frame of reference. (b) In an inertial frame of reference and

     according to Newton's laws, it is his inertia that carries him off (the unshaded rider has  and heads in a straight line). A force,

     , is needed to cause a circular path.

     This inertial effect, carrying you away from the center of rotation if there is no centripetal force to cause circular
     motion, is put to good use in centrifuges (Figure 6.26). A centrifuge spins a sample very rapidly, as mentioned earlier
     in this chapter. Viewed from the rotating frame of reference, the inertial force throws particles outward, hastening
     their sedimentation. The greater the angular velocity, the greater the centrifugal force. But what really happens is
     that the inertia of the particles carries them along a line tangent to the circle while the test tube is forced in a
     circular path by a centripetal force.

FIGURE 6.26 Centrifuges use inertia to perform their task. Particles in the fluid sediment settle out because their inertia carries them away
from the center of rotation. The large angular velocity of the centrifuge quickens the sedimentation. Ultimately, the particles come into
contact with the test tube walls, which then supply the centripetal force needed to make them move in a circle of constant radius.

Let us now consider what happens if something moves in a rotating frame of reference. For example, what if you
slide a ball directly away from the center of the merry-go-round, as shown in Figure 6.27? The ball follows a straight
path relative to Earth (assuming negligible friction) and a path curved to the right on the merry-go-round's surface. A
person standing next to the merry-go-round sees the ball moving straight and the merry-go-round rotating
underneath it. In the merry-go-round's frame of reference, we explain the apparent curve to the right by using an
inertial force, called the Coriolis force, which causes the ball to curve to the right. The Coriolis force can be used by
anyone in that frame of reference to explain why objects follow curved paths and allows us to apply Newton's laws
in noninertial frames of reference.

FIGURE 6.27 Looking down on the counterclockwise rotation of a merry-go-round, we see that a ball slid straight toward the edge follows a
path curved to the right. The person slides the ball toward point B, starting at point A. Both points rotate to the shaded positions (A' and B')
shown in the time that the ball follows the curved path in the rotating frame and a straight path in Earth's frame.

Up until now, we have considered Earth to be an inertial frame of reference with little or no worry about effects due
to its rotation. Yet such effects do exist--in the rotation of weather systems, for example. Most consequences of
Earth's rotation can be qualitatively understood by analogy with the merry-go-round. Viewed from above the North
Pole, Earth rotates counterclockwise, as does the merry-go-round in Figure 6.27. As on the merry-go-round, any
motion in Earth's Northern Hemisphere experiences a Coriolis force to the right. Just the opposite occurs in the
Southern Hemisphere; there, the force is to the left. Because Earth's angular velocity is small, the Coriolis force is
usually negligible, but for large-scale motions, such as wind patterns, it has substantial effects.
282  6 · Applications of Newton's Laws

     The Coriolis force causes hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere to rotate in the counterclockwise direction,
     whereas tropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere rotate in the clockwise direction. (The terms hurricane,
     typhoon, and tropical storm are regionally specific names for cyclones, which are storm systems characterized by
     low pressure centers, strong winds, and heavy rains.) Figure 6.28 helps show how these rotations take place. Air
     flows toward any region of low pressure, and tropical cyclones contain particularly low pressures. Thus winds flow
     toward the center of a tropical cyclone or a low-pressure weather system at the surface. In the Northern
     Hemisphere, these inward winds are deflected to the right, as shown in the figure, producing a counterclockwise
     circulation at the surface for low-pressure zones of any type. Low pressure at the surface is associated with rising
     air, which also produces cooling and cloud formation, making low-pressure patterns quite visible from space.
     Conversely, wind circulation around high-pressure zones is clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere but is less visible
     because high pressure is associated with sinking air, producing clear skies.

     FIGURE 6.28 (a) The counterclockwise rotation of this Northern Hemisphere hurricane is a major consequence of the Coriolis force. (b)
     Without the Coriolis force, air would flow straight into a low-pressure zone, such as that found in tropical cyclones. (c) The Coriolis force
     deflects the winds to the right, producing a counterclockwise rotation. (d) Wind flowing away from a high-pressure zone is also deflected to
     the right, producing a clockwise rotation. (e) The opposite direction of rotation is produced by the Coriolis force in the Southern
     Hemisphere, leading to tropical cyclones. (credit a and credit e: modifications of work by NASA)

     The rotation of tropical cyclones and the path of a ball on a merry-go-round can just as well be explained by inertia
     and the rotation of the system underneath. When noninertial frames are used, inertial forces, such as the Coriolis
     force, must be invented to explain the curved path. There is no identifiable physical source for these inertial forces.
     In an inertial frame, inertia explains the path, and no force is found to be without an identifiable source. Either view
     allows us to describe nature, but a view in an inertial frame is the simplest in the sense that all forces have origins
     and explanations.

     a liquid). You feel the drag force when you move your hand through water. You might also feel it if you move your

hand during a strong wind. The faster you move your hand, the harder it is to move. You feel a smaller drag force
when you tilt your hand so only the side goes through the air--you have decreased the area of your hand that faces
the direction of motion.

Drag Forces

Like friction, the drag force always opposes the motion of an object. Unlike simple friction, the drag force is

proportional to some function of the velocity of the object in that fluid. This functionality is complicated and

depends upon the shape of the object, its size, its velocity, and the fluid it is in. For most large objects such as

cyclists, cars, and baseballs not moving too slowly, the magnitude of the drag force is proportional to the square

of the speed of the object. We can write this relationship mathematically as  When taking into account

other factors, this relationship becomes

                                                                                                                      6.5

where C is the drag coefficient, A is the area of the object facing the fluid, and is the density of the fluid. (Recall

that density is mass per unit volume.) This equation can also be written in a more generalized fashion as

where b is a constant equivalent to       We have set the exponent n for these equations as 2 because when an

object is moving at high velocity through air, the magnitude of the drag force is proportional to the square of the

speed. As we shall see in Fluid Mechanics, for small particles moving at low speeds in a fluid, the exponent n is

equal to 1.

DRAG FORCE

Drag force is proportional to the square of the speed of the object. Mathematically,

  where C is the drag coefficient, A is the area of the object facing the fluid, and is the density of the fluid.

Athletes as well as car designers seek to reduce the drag force to lower their race times (Figure 6.29). Aerodynamic
shaping of an automobile can reduce the drag force and thus increase a car's gas mileage.

FIGURE 6.29 From racing cars to bobsled racers, aerodynamic shaping is crucial to achieving top speeds. Bobsleds are designed for speed
and are shaped like a bullet with tapered fins. (credit: "U.S. Army"/Wikimedia Commons)

The value of the drag coefficient C is determined empirically, usually with the use of a wind tunnel (Figure 6.30).

     The drag coefficient can depend upon velocity, but we assume that it is a constant here. Table 6.2 lists some typical

     drag coefficients for a variety of objects. Notice that the drag coefficient is a dimensionless quantity. At highway

     speeds, over  of the power of a car is used to overcome air drag. The most fuel-efficient cruising speed is about

     70-80 km/h (about 45-50 mi/h). For this reason, during the 1970s oil crisis in the United States, maximum speeds

     on highways were set at about 90 km/h (55 mi/h).

Substantial research is under way in the sporting world to minimize drag. The dimples on golf balls are being
redesigned, as are the clothes that athletes wear. Bicycle racers and some swimmers and runners wear full
bodysuits. Australian Cathy Freeman wore a full body suit in the 2000 Sydney Olympics and won a gold medal in the
400-m race. Many swimmers in the 2008 Beijing Olympics wore (Speedo) body suits; it might have made a
difference in breaking many world records (Figure 6.31). Most elite swimmers (and cyclists) shave their body hair.
Such innovations can have the effect of slicing away milliseconds in a race, sometimes making the difference
between a gold and a silver medal. One consequence is that careful and precise guidelines must be continuously
developed to maintain the integrity of the sport.

FIGURE 6.31 Body suits, such as this LZR Racer Suit, have been credited with aiding in many world records after their release in 2008.

Terminal Velocity

Some interesting situations connected to Newton's second law occur when considering the effects of drag forces

upon a moving object. For instance, consider a skydiver falling through air under the influence of gravity. The two

forces acting on him are the force of gravity and the drag force (ignoring the small buoyant force). The downward

force of gravity remains constant regardless of the velocity at which the person is moving. However, as the person's

velocity increases, the magnitude of the drag force increases until the magnitude of the drag force is equal to the

gravitational force, thus producing a net force of zero. A zero net force means that there is no acceleration, as shown

by Newton's second law. At this point, the person's velocity remains constant and we say that the person has

reached his terminal velocity  Since is proportional to the speed squared, a heavier skydiver must go

faster for to equal his weight. Let's see how this works out more quantitatively.

At the terminal velocity,

Thus,
286  6 · Applications of Newton's Laws

     Using the equation for drag force, we have

     Solving for the velocity, we obtain

     Assume the density of air is                A 75-kg skydiver descending head first has a cross-sectional area of

     approximately                    and a drag coefficient of approximately  . We find that

     This means a skydiver with a mass of 75 kg achieves a terminal velocity of about 350 km/h while traveling in a
     headfirst position, minimizing the area and his drag. In a spread-eagle position, that terminal velocity may decrease
     to about 200 km/h as the area increases. This terminal velocity becomes much smaller after the parachute opens.

     EXAMPLE 6.17

     Terminal Velocity of a Skydiver

     Find the terminal velocity of an 85-kg skydiver falling in a spread-eagle position. Assume that in the spread-eagle

     position, the diver has a cross-sectional area of   .

     Strategy

     At terminal velocity,            Thus, the drag force on the skydiver must equal the force of gravity (the person's

     weight). Using the equation of drag force, we find

     Solution               can be written as
     The terminal velocity

     Significance

     This result is consistent with the value for mentioned earlier. The 75-kg skydiver going feet first had a terminal

     velocity of            He weighed less but had a smaller frontal area and so a smaller drag due to the air.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 6.10

     Find the terminal velocity of a 50-kg skydiver falling in spread-eagle fashion.

     The size of the object that is falling through air presents another interesting application of air drag. If you fall from a
     5-m-high branch of a tree, you will likely get hurt--possibly fracturing a bone. However, a small squirrel does this all
     the time, without getting hurt. You do not reach a terminal velocity in such a short distance, but the squirrel does.

     The following interesting quote on animal size and terminal velocity is from a 1928 essay by a British biologist, J. B.
     S. Haldane, titled "On Being the Right Size."

     "To the mouse and any smaller animal, [gravity] presents practically no dangers. You can drop a mouse down a
     thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the
     ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, and a horse splashes. For the resistance presented to movement
     by the air is proportional to the surface of the moving object. Divide an animal's length, breadth, and height each by

ten; its weight is reduced to a thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the resistance to falling in the case
of the small animal is relatively ten times greater than the driving force."
The above quadratic dependence of air drag upon velocity does not hold if the object is very small, is going very
slow, or is in a denser medium than air. Then we find that the drag force is proportional just to the velocity. This
relationship is given by Stokes' law.

  STOKES' LAW

  For a spherical object falling in a medium, the drag force is
                                                                                                                                                    6.6

  where r is the radius of the object, is the viscosity of the fluid, and v is the object's velocity.

Good examples of Stokes' law are provided by microorganisms, pollen, and dust particles. Because each of these

objects is so small, we find that many of these objects travel unaided only at a constant (terminal) velocity. Terminal

velocities for bacteria (size about  can be about  To move at a greater speed, many bacteria swim using

flagella (organelles shaped like little tails) that are powered by little motors embedded in the cell.

Sediment in a lake can move at a greater terminal velocity (about  so it can take days for it to reach the
bottom of the lake after being deposited on the surface.

If we compare animals living on land with those in water, you can see how drag has influenced evolution. Fish,
dolphins, and even massive whales are streamlined in shape to reduce drag forces. Birds are streamlined and
migratory species that fly large distances often have particular features such as long necks. Flocks of birds fly in the
shape of a spearhead as the flock forms a streamlined pattern (Figure 6.32). In humans, one important example of
streamlining is the shape of sperm, which need to be efficient in their use of energy.

birds, and also allows them a better way to communicate. (credit: modification of work by "Julo"/Wikimedia Commons)

     force is generally a complicated function of the body's velocity. However, for a body moving in a straight line at
     moderate speeds through a liquid such as water, the frictional force can often be approximated by

     where b is a constant whose value depends on the dimensions and shape of the body and the properties of the
     liquid, and v is the velocity of the body. Two situations for which the frictional force can be represented by this

     downward is shown in Figure 6.33. Newton's second law in the vertical direction gives the differential equation

     EXAMPLE 6.18

Effect of the Resistive Force on a Motorboat

A motorboat is moving across a lake at a speed when its motor suddenly freezes up and stops. The boat then

slows down under the frictional force         (a) What are the velocity and position of the boat as functions of

time? (b) If the boat slows down from 4.0 to 1.0 m/s in 10 s, how far does it travel before stopping?

Solution

a. With the motor stopped, the only horizontal force on the boat is            so from Newton's second law,

     which we can write as

     Integrating this equation between the time zero when the velocity is      and the time t when the velocity is ,
     we have

     Thus,

     which, since                             we can write this as

     Now from the definition of velocity,

     so we have
     With the initial position zero, we have
290  6 · Applications of Newton's Laws

     and

     As time increases,                 and the position of the boat approaches a limiting value

     Although this tells us that the boat takes an infinite amount of time to reach      the boat effectively stops

     after a reasonable time. For example, at      we have

     whereas we also have

     Therefore, the boat's velocity and position have essentially reached their final values.

     b. With             and              we have                                    so

     Now the boat's limiting position is

     Significance

     In the both of the previous examples, we found "limiting" values. The terminal velocity is the same as the limiting
     velocity, which is the velocity of the falling object after a (relatively) long time has passed. Similarly, the limiting
     distance of the boat is the distance the boat will travel after a long amount of time has passed. Due to the properties
     of exponential decay, the time involved to reach either of these values is actually not too long (certainly not an
     infinite amount of time!) but they are quickly found by taking the limit to infinity.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
7.1 Work
7.2 Kinetic Energy
7.3 Work-Energy Theorem
7.4 Power

INTRODUCTION In this chapter, we discuss some basic physical concepts involved in every physical motion in the
universe, going beyond the concepts of force and change in motion, which we discussed in Motion in Two and Three
Dimensions and Newton's Laws of Motion. These concepts are work, kinetic energy, and power. We explain how
these quantities are related to one another, which will lead us to a fundamental relationship called the work-energy
theorem. In the next chapter, we generalize this idea to the broader principle of conservation of energy.
The application of Newton's laws usually requires solving differential equations that relate the forces acting on an
object to the accelerations they produce. Often, an analytic solution is intractable or impossible, requiring lengthy
numerical solutions or simulations to get approximate results. In such situations, more general relations, like the
work-energy theorem (or the conservation of energy), can still provide useful answers to many questions and
require a more modest amount of mathematical calculation. In particular, you will see how the work-energy
theorem is useful in relating the speeds of a particle, at different points along its trajectory, to the forces acting on it,
even when the trajectory is otherwise too complicated to deal with. Thus, some aspects of motion can be addressed
with fewer equations and without vector decompositions.

     7.1 Work

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Represent the work done by any force
         · Evaluate the work done for various forces

     In physics, work is done on an object when energy is transferred to the object. In other words, work is done when a
     force acts on something that undergoes a displacement from one position to another. Forces can vary as a function
     of position, and displacements can be along various paths between two points. We first define the increment of
     work dW done by a force acting through an infinitesimal displacement as the dot product of these two vectors:

                                                                                                                                                            7.1

     Then, we can add up the contributions for infinitesimal displacements, along a path between two positions, to get
     the total work.

       WORK DONE BY A FORCE

       The work done by a force is the integral of the force with respect to displacement along the path of the
       displacement:

                                                                                                                                                         7.2

     The vectors involved in the definition of the work done by a force acting on a particle are illustrated in Figure 7.2.
     While in general, Equation 7.2 requires mathematics beyond the scope of this text, in many simple situations this
     integral becomes a familiar integral in one variable. We will examine several such examples and restrict our
     discussion to these cases.

     FIGURE 7.2 Vectors used to define work. The force acting on a particle and its infinitesimal displacement are shown at one point along the
     path between A and B. The infinitesimal work is the dot product of these two vectors; the total work is the integral of the dot product along
     the path.

     We choose to express the dot product in terms of the magnitudes of the vectors and the cosine of the angle between
     them, because the meaning of the dot product for work can be put into words more directly in terms of magnitudes
     and angles. We could equally well have expressed the dot product in terms of the various components introduced in
     Vectors. In two dimensions, these were the x- and y-components in Cartesian coordinates, or the r- and

       -components in polar coordinates; in three dimensions, it was just x-, y-, and z-components. Which choice is more
     convenient depends on the situation. In words, you can express Equation 7.1 for the work done by a force acting
     over a displacement as a product of one component acting parallel to the other component. From the properties of
     vectors, it doesn't matter if you take the component of the force parallel to the displacement or the component of
     the displacement parallel to the force--you get the same result either way.

     Recall that the magnitude of a force times the cosine of the angle the force makes with a given direction is the
     component of the force in the given direction. The components of a vector can be positive, negative, or zero,
     depending on whether the angle between the vector and the component-direction is between and or and

           , or is equal to . As a result, the work done by a force can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on
     whether the force is generally in the direction of the displacement, generally opposite to the displacement, or

perpendicular to the displacement. The maximum work is done by a given force when it is along the direction of the

displacement (        ), and zero work is done when the force is perpendicular to the displacement (                                    ).

The units of work are units of force multiplied by units of length, which in the SI system is newtons times meters,
         This combination is called a joule, for historical reasons that we will mention later, and is abbreviated as J. In

the English system, still used in the United States, the unit of force is the pound (lb) and the unit of distance is the
foot (ft), so the unit of work is the foot-pound

Work Done by Constant Forces and Contact Forces

The simplest work to evaluate is that done by a force that is constant in magnitude and direction. In this case, we
can factor out the force; the remaining integral is just the total displacement, which only depends on the end points
A and B, but not on the path between them:

Figure 7.3(a) shows a person exerting a constant force along the handle of a lawn mower, which makes an angle

with the horizontal. The horizontal displacement of the lawn mower, over which the force acts, is The work done

     Figure 7.3(b) shows a person holding a briefcase. The person must exert an upward force, equal in magnitude to the
     weight of the briefcase, but this force does no work, because the displacement over which it acts is zero.

     In Figure 7.3(c), where the person in (b) is walking horizontally with constant speed, the work done by the person on

     the briefcase is still zero, but now because the angle between the force exerted and the displacement is (

     perpendicular to ) and               .

     Calculating the Work You Do to Push a Lawn Mower

     How much work is done on the lawn mower by the person in Figure 7.3(a) if he exerts a constant force of 75.0 N at
     an angle below the horizontal and pushes the mower 25.0 m on level ground?

     Strategy

     We can solve this problem by substituting the given values into the definition of work done on an object by a

     constant force, stated in the equation  . The force, angle, and displacement are given, so that only the

     work W is unknown.

     Solution
     The equation for the work is

     Substituting the known values gives

     Significance
     Even though one and a half kilojoules may seem like a lot of work, we will see in Potential Energy and Conservation
     of Energy that it's only about as much work as you could do by burning one sixth of a gram of fat.

     When you mow the grass, other forces act on the lawn mower besides the force you exert--namely, the contact force
     of the ground and the gravitational force of Earth. Let's consider the work done by these forces in general. For an

     object moving on a surface, the displacement is tangent to the surface. The part of the contact force on the

     object that is perpendicular to the surface is the normal force  Since the cosine of the angle between the normal
     and the tangent to a surface is zero, we have

     The normal force never does work under these circumstances. (Note that if the displacement did have a relative
     component perpendicular to the surface, the object would either leave the surface or break through it, and there
     would no longer be any normal contact force. However, if the object is more than a particle, and has an internal
     structure, the normal contact force can do work on it, for example, by displacing it or deforming its shape. This will
     be mentioned in the next chapter.)

     The part of the contact force on the object that is parallel to the surface is friction, For this object sliding along the

     surface, kinetic friction is opposite to relative to the surface, so the work done by kinetic friction is negative. If

     the magnitude of     is constant (as it would be if all the other forces on the object were constant), then the work
     done by friction is

                                                                                                                    7.3

friction can do work. Static friction can keep someone from sliding off a sled when the sled is moving and perform
positive work on the person. If you're driving your car at the speed limit on a straight, level stretch of highway, the
negative work done by air resistance is balanced by the positive work done by the static friction of the road on the
drive wheels. You can pull the rug out from under an object in such a way that it slides backward relative to the rug,
but forward relative to the floor. In this case, kinetic friction exerted by the rug on the object could be in the same
direction as the displacement of the object, relative to the floor, and do positive work. The bottom line is that you
need to analyze each particular case to determine the work done by the forces, whether positive, negative or zero.

        EXAMPLE 7.2

Moving a Couch

You decide to move your couch to a new position on your horizontal living room floor. The normal force on the couch
is 1 kN and the coefficient of friction is 0.6. (a) You first push the couch 3 m parallel to a wall and then 1 m
perpendicular to the wall (A to B in Figure 7.4). How much work is done by the frictional force? (b) You don't like the
new position, so you move the couch straight back to its original position (B to A in Figure 7.4). What was the total
work done against friction moving the couch away from its original position and back again?

                                FIGURE 7.4 Top view of paths for moving a couch.

Strategy

The magnitude of the force of kinetic friction on the couch is constant, equal to the coefficient of friction times the

normal force,  . Therefore, the work done by it is            , where d is the path length traversed. The

segments of the paths are the sides of a right triangle, so the path lengths are easily calculated. In part (b), you can

use the fact that the work done against a force is the negative of the work done by the force.

Solution

a. The work done by friction i

b. The length of the path along the hypotenuse is             , so the total work done against friction is

Significance

The total path over which the work of friction was evaluated began and ended at the same point (it was a closed
path), so that the total displacement of the couch was zero. However, the total work was not zero. The reason is that
forces like friction are classified as nonconservative forces, or dissipative forces, as we discuss in the next chapter.

Can kinetic friction ever be a constant force for all paths?

The other force on the lawn mower mentioned above was Earth's gravitational force, or the weight of the mower.

Near the surface of Earth, the gravitational force on an object of mass m has a constant magnitude, mg, and

constant direction, vertically down. Therefore, the work done by gravity on an object is the dot product of its weight

and its displacement. In many cases, it is convenient to express the dot product for gravitational work in terms of

the x-, y-, and z-components of the vectors. A typical coordinate system has the x-axis horizontal and the y-axis

vertically up. Then the gravitational force is  so the work done by gravity, over any path from A to B, is

     The work done by a constant force of gravity on an object depends only on the object's weight and the difference in

     height through which the object is displaced. Gravity does negative work on an object that moves upward

     (         ), or, in other words, you must do positive work against gravity to lift an object upward. Alternately, gravity

     does positive work on an object that moves downward (        ), or you do negative work against gravity to "lift"

     an object downward, controlling its descent so it doesn't drop to the ground. ("Lift" is used as opposed to "drop".)

             EXAMPLE 7.3

     Shelving a Book

     You lift an oversized library book, weighing 20 N, 1 m vertically down from a shelf, and carry it 3 m horizontally to a
     table (Figure 7.5). (a) How much work does gravity do on the book? (b) When you're finished, you move the book in a
     straight line back to its original place on the shelf. What was the total work done against gravity, moving the book
     away from its original position on the shelf and back again?

                                      FIGURE 7.5 Side view of the paths for moving a book to and from a shelf.

     Strategy

     We have just seen that the work done by a constant force of gravity depends only on the weight of the object moved

     and the difference in height for the path taken,                          . We can evaluate the difference in height to

     answer (a) and (b).

     Solution

        a. Since the book starts on the shelf and is lifted down               , we have

        b. There is zero difference in height for any path that begins and ends at the same place on the shelf, so

     Significance

     Gravity does positive work (20 J) when the book moves down from the shelf. The gravitational force between two

     objects is an attractive force, which does positive work when the objects get closer together. Gravity does zero work

     (0 J) when the book moves horizontally from the shelf to the table and negative work (-20 J) when the book moves

     from the table back to the shelf. The total work done by gravity is zero                                   Unlike friction or

     other dissipative forces, described in Example 7.2, the total work done against gravity, over any closed path, is zero.

     Positive work is done against gravity on the upward parts of a closed path, but an equal amount of negative work is

     done against gravity on the downward parts. In other words, work done against gravity, lifting an object up, is "given

     back" when the object comes back down. Forces like gravity (those that do zero work over any closed path) are

     classified as conservative forces and play an important role in physics.

Can Earth's gravity ever be a constant force for all paths?

Work Done by Forces that Vary

In general, forces may vary in magnitude and direction at points in space, and paths between two points may be
curved. The infinitesimal work done by a variable force can be expressed in terms of the components of the force
and the displacement along the path,

Here, the components of the force are functions of position along the path, and the displacements depend on the
equations of the path. (Although we chose to illustrate dW in Cartesian coordinates, other coordinates are better
suited to some situations.) Equation 7.2 defines the total work as a line integral, or the limit of a sum of infinitesimal
amounts of work. The physical concept of work is straightforward: you calculate the work for tiny displacements and
add them up. Sometimes the mathematics can seem complicated, but the following example demonstrates how
cleanly they can operate.

The components of the force are given functions of x and y. We can use the equation of the path to express y and dy

     Find the work done by the same force in Example 7.4 over a cubic path,               , between the same

     points           and

     One very important and widely applicable variable force is the force exerted by a perfectly elastic spring, which

     satisfies Hooke's law            where k is the spring constant, and                 is the displacement from the

     spring's unstretched (equilibrium) position (Newton's Laws of Motion). Note that the unstretched position is only the
     same as the equilibrium position if no other forces are acting (or, if they are, they cancel one another). Forces
     between molecules, or in any system undergoing small displacements from a stable equilibrium, behave
     approximately like a spring force.

     To calculate the work done by a spring force, we can choose the x-axis along the length of the spring, in the direction

     of increasing length, as in Figure 7.7, with the origin at the equilibrium position  (Then positive x

     corresponds to a stretch and negative x to a compression.) With this choice of coordinates, the spring force has only

     an x-component,                  , and the work done when x changes from to is

                                                                                                                         7.5

     Notice that      depends only on the starting and ending points, A and B, and is independent of the actual path

     between them, as long as it starts at A and ends at B. That is, the actual path could involve going back and forth

     before ending.

     Another interesting thing to notice about Equation 7.5 is that, for this one-dimensional case, you can readily see the

     correspondence between the work done by a force and the area under the curve of the force versus its

     displacement. Recall that, in general, a one-dimensional integral is the limit of the sum of infinitesimals,        ,

     representing the area of strips, as shown in Figure 7.8. In Equation 7.5, since      is a straight line with slope

    , when plotted versus x, the "area" under the line is just an algebraic combination of triangular "areas," where
"areas" above the x-axis are positive and those below are negative, as shown in Figure 7.9. The magnitude of one of
these "areas" is just one-half the triangle's base, along the x-axis, times the triangle's height, along the force axis.
(There are quotation marks around "area" because this base-height product has the units of work, rather than
square meters.)

quantity       at the end points. Notice that the work required to stretch the spring from 0 to 12 cm is four times

that required to stretch it from 0 to 6 cm, because that work depends on the square of the amount of stretch from

     equilibrium,  . In this circumstance, the work to stretch the spring from 0 to 12 cm is also equal to the work for

     a composite path from 0 to 6 cm followed by an additional stretch from 6 cm to 12 cm. Therefore,

     7.2 Kinetic Energy

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Calculate the kinetic energy of a particle given its mass and its velocity or momentum
         · Evaluate the kinetic energy of a body, relative to different frames of reference

     It's plausible to suppose that the greater the velocity of a body, the greater effect it could have on other bodies. This
     does not depend on the direction of the velocity, only its magnitude. At the end of the seventeenth century, a
     quantity was introduced into mechanics to explain collisions between two perfectly elastic bodies, in which one
     body makes a head-on collision with an identical body at rest. The first body stops, and the second body moves off
     with the initial velocity of the first body. (If you have ever played billiards or croquet, or seen a model of Newton's
     Cradle, you have observed this type of collision.) The idea behind this quantity was related to the forces acting on a
     body and was referred to as "the energy of motion." Later on, during the eighteenth century, the name kinetic
     energy was given to energy of motion.

     With this history in mind, we can now state the classical definition of kinetic energy. Note that when we say
     "classical," we mean non-relativistic, that is, at speeds much less that the speed of light. At speeds comparable to
     the speed of light, the special theory of relativity requires a different expression for the kinetic energy of a particle,
     as discussed in Relativity (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/5-introduction).

     Since objects (or systems) of interest vary in complexity, we first define the kinetic energy of a particle with mass m.

       KINETIC ENERGY

       The kinetic energy of a particle is one-half the product of the particle's mass m and the square of its speed v:
                                                                                                                                                         7.6

     We then extend this definition to any system of particles by adding up the kinetic energies of all the constituent
     particles:

                                                                                                                                                            7.7

     Note that just as we can express Newton's second law in terms of either the rate of change of momentum or mass

     times the rate of change of velocity, so the kinetic energy of a particle can be expressed in terms of its mass and

     momentum      instead of its mass and velocity. Since               , we see that

     also expresses the kinetic energy of a single particle. Sometimes, this expression is more convenient to use than
     Equation 7.6.

     The units of kinetic energy are mass times the square of speed, or  . But the units of force are mass times

acceleration,          , so the units of kinetic energy are also the units of force times distance, which are the units

of work, or joules. You will see in the next section that work and kinetic energy have the same units, because they

are different forms of the same, more general, physical property.

22 km/s and releasing        of kinetic energy upon impact. What was its mass? (c) In nuclear reactors,

thermal neutrons, traveling at about 2.2 km/s, play an important role. What is the kinetic energy of such a particle?

Strategy
To answer these questions, you can use the definition of kinetic energy in Equation 7.6. You also have to look up the
mass of a neutron.

Don't forget to convert km into m to do these calculations, although, to save space, we omitted showing these
conversions.

In this example, we used the way mass and speed are related to kinetic energy, and we encountered a very wide

                       The Chicxulub asteroid's kinetic energy was about a hundred million megatons. At the

other extreme, the energy of subatomic particle is expressed in electron-volts,                         The thermal

Because velocity is a relative quantity, you can see that the value of kinetic energy must depend on your frame of
reference. You can generally choose a frame of reference that is suited to the purpose of your analysis and that
simplifies your calculations. One such frame of reference is the one in which the observations of the system are
made (likely an external frame). Another choice is a frame that is attached to, or moves with, the system (likely an
internal frame). The equations for relative motion, discussed in Motion in Two and Three Dimensions, provide a link
to calculating the kinetic energy of an object with respect to different frames of reference.

               We can assume that the central aisle and the tracks lie along the same line, but the direction the

     person is walking relative to the car isn't specified, so we will give an answer for each possibility,                                   ,

     Significance

     You can see that the kinetic energy of an object can have very different values, depending on the frame of reference.
     However, the kinetic energy of an object can never be negative, since it is the product of the mass and the square of
     the speed, both of which are always positive or zero.

     divided into various types, depending on the system and its motion. For example, if all the particles in a system have
     the same velocity, the system is undergoing translational motion and has translational kinetic energy. If an object is
     rotating, it could have rotational kinetic energy, or if it's vibrating, it could have vibrational kinetic energy. The kinetic
     energy of a system, relative to an internal frame of reference, may be called internal kinetic energy. The kinetic
     energy associated with random molecular motion may be called thermal energy. These names will be used in later
     chapters of the book, when appropriate. Regardless of the name, every kind of kinetic energy is the same physical
     quantity, representing energy associated with motion.

EXAMPLE 7.8

Special Names for Kinetic Energy

(a) A player lobs a mid-court pass with a 624-g basketball, which covers 15 m in 2 s. What is the basketball's

horizontal translational kinetic energy while in flight? (b) An average molecule of air, in the basketball in part (a), has

a mass of 29 u, and an average speed of 500 m/s, relative to the basketball. There are about      molecules

inside it, moving in random directions, when the ball is properly inflated. What is the average translational kinetic

energy of the random motion of all the molecules inside, relative to the basketball? (c) How fast would the

basketball have to travel relative to the court, as in part (a), so as to have a kinetic energy equal to the amount in

part (b)?

Strategy

In part (a), first find the horizontal speed of the basketball and then use the definition of kinetic energy in terms of

mass and speed,  . Then in part (b), convert unified units to kilograms and then use                         to get the

average translational kinetic energy of one molecule, relative to the basketball. Then multiply by the number of

molecules to get the total result. Finally, in part (c), we can substitute the amount of kinetic energy in part (b), and

the mass of the basketball in part (a), into the definition   , and solve for v.

Solution
  a. The horizontal speed is (15 m)/(2 s), so the horizontal kinetic energy of the basketball is

b. The average translational kinetic energy of a molecule is

        and the total kinetic energy of all the molecules is

   c.

Significance
In part (a), this kind of kinetic energy can be called the horizontal kinetic energy of an object (the basketball),
relative to its surroundings (the court). If the basketball were spinning, all parts of it would have not just the average
speed, but it would also have rotational kinetic energy. Part (b) reminds us that this kind of kinetic energy can be
called internal or thermal kinetic energy. Notice that this energy is about a hundred times the energy in part (a). How
to make use of thermal energy will be the subject of the chapters on thermodynamics. In part (c), since the energy in
part (b) is about 100 times that in part (a), the speed should be about 10 times as big, which it is (76 compared to
7.5 m/s).

7.3 Work-Energy Theorem

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Apply the work-energy theorem to find information about the motion of a particle, given the forces acting
        on it

    · Use the work-energy theorem to find information about the forces acting on a particle, given information
        about its motion

We have discussed how to find the work done on a particle by the forces that act on it, but how is that work
manifested in the motion of the particle? According to Newton's second law of motion, the sum of all the forces
acting on a particle, or the net force, determines the rate of change in the momentum of the particle, or its motion.
Therefore, we should consider the work done by all the forces acting on a particle, or the net work, to see what
322  7 · Work and Kinetic Energy

     effect it has on the particle's motion.

     Let's start by looking at the net work done on a particle as it moves over an infinitesimal displacement, which is the

     dot product of the net force and the displacement:  Newton's second law tells us that

     so                                       For the mathematical functions describing the motion of a physical

     particle, we can rearrange the differentials dt, etc., as algebraic quantities in this expression, that is,

     where we substituted the velocity for the time derivative of the displacement and used the commutative property of
     the dot product [Equation 2.30]. Since derivatives and integrals of scalars are probably more familiar to you at this
     point, we express the dot product in terms of Cartesian coordinates before we integrate between any two points A
     and B on the particle's trajectory. This gives us the net work done on the particle:

                                                                                                                                                            7.8

     In the middle step, we used the fact that the square of the velocity is the sum of the squares of its Cartesian
     components, and in the last step, we used the definition of the particle's kinetic energy. This important result is
     called the work-energy theorem (Figure 7.11).

       WORK-ENERGY THEOREM

       The net work done on a particle equals the change in the particle's kinetic energy:
                                                                                                                                                         7.9

     FIGURE 7.11 Horse pulls are common events at state fairs. The work done by the horses pulling on the load results in a change in kinetic
     energy of the load, ultimately going faster. (credit: modification of work by "Jassen"/ Flickr)

     According to this theorem, when an object slows down, its final kinetic energy is less than its initial kinetic energy,
     the change in its kinetic energy is negative, and so is the net work done on it. If an object speeds up, the net work
     done on it is positive. When calculating the net work, you must include all the forces that act on an object. If you
     leave out any forces that act on an object, or if you include any forces that don't act on it, you will get a wrong result.
     The importance of the work-energy theorem, and the further generalizations to which it leads, is that it makes some
     types of calculations much simpler to accomplish than they would be by trying to solve Newton's second law. For
     example, in Newton's Laws of Motion, we found the speed of an object sliding down a frictionless plane by solving

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                       7.3 · Work-Energy Theorem                         323

Newton's second law for the acceleration and using kinematic equations for constant acceleration, obtaining

where s is the displacement down the plane.

We can also get this result from the work-energy theorem in Equation 7.1. Since only two forces are acting on the
object-gravity and the normal force-and the normal force doesn't do any work, the net work is just the work done by

gravity. The work dW is the dot product of the force of gravity or     and the displacement                           .
After taking the dot product and integrating from an initial position
                                                                       to a final position , one finds the net work

as

where y is positive up. The work-energy theorem says that this equals the change in kinetic energy:

Using a right triangle, we can see that      so the result for the final speed is the same.

What is gained by using the work-energy theorem? The answer is that for a frictionless plane surface, not much.
However, Newton's second law is easy to solve only for this particular case, whereas the work-energy theorem gives
the final speed for any shaped frictionless surface. For an arbitrary curved surface, the normal force is not constant,
and Newton's second law may be difficult or impossible to solve analytically. Constant or not, for motion along a
surface, the normal force never does any work, because it's perpendicular to the displacement. A calculation using
the work-energy theorem avoids this difficulty and applies to more general situations.

        PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Work-Energy Theorem

  1. Draw a free-body diagram for each force on the object.
  2. Determine whether or not each force does work over the displacement in the diagram. Be sure to keep any

        positive or negative signs in the work done.
  3. Add up the total amount of work done by each force.
  4. Set this total work equal to the change in kinetic energy and solve for any unknown parameter.
  5. Check your answers. If the object is traveling at a constant speed or zero acceleration, the total work done

        should be zero and match the change in kinetic energy. If the total work is positive, the object must have sped
        up or increased kinetic energy. If the total work is negative, the object must have slowed down or decreased
        kinetic energy.

        EXAMPLE 7.9

Loop-the-Loop

The frictionless track for a toy car includes a loop-the-loop of radius R. How high, measured from the bottom of the
loop, must the car be placed to start from rest on the approaching section of track and go all the way around the
loop?
324  7 · Work and Kinetic Energy

     FIGURE 7.12 A frictionless track for a toy car has a loop-the-loop in it. How high must the car start so that it can go around the loop without
     falling off?

     Strategy
     The free-body diagram at the final position of the object is drawn in Figure 7.12. The gravitational work is the only
     work done over the displacement that is not zero. Since the weight points in the same direction as the net vertical
     displacement, the total work done by the gravitational force is positive. From the work-energy theorem, the starting
     height determines the speed of the car at the top of the loop,

     where the notation is shown in the accompanying figure. At the top of the loop, the normal force and gravity are both
     down and the acceleration is centripetal, so

     The condition for maintaining contact with the track is that there must be some normal force, however slight; that is,
              . Substituting for and N, we can find the condition for .

     Solution
     Implement the steps in the strategy to arrive at the desired result:

                                                                                

     Significance
     On the surface of the loop, the normal component of gravity and the normal contact force must provide the
     centripetal acceleration of the car going around the loop. The tangential component of gravity slows down or speeds
     up the car. A child would find out how high to start the car by trial and error, but now that you know the work-energy
     theorem, you can predict the minimum height (as well as other more useful results) from physical principles. By
     using the work-energy theorem, you did not have to solve a differential equation to determine the height.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 7.7

     Suppose the radius of the loop-the-loop in Example 7.9 is 15 cm and the toy car starts from rest at a height of 45 cm

        EXAMPLE 7.10

Determining a Stopping Force

A bullet has a mass of 40 grains (2.60 g) and a muzzle velocity of 1100 ft./s (335 m/s). It can penetrate eight 1-inch
pine boards, each with thickness 0.75 inches. What is the average stopping force exerted by the wood, as shown in
Figure 7.13?

           FIGURE 7.13 The boards exert a force to stop the bullet. As a result, the boards do work and the bullet loses kinetic energy.

Strategy
We can assume that under the general conditions stated, the bullet loses all its kinetic energy penetrating the
boards, so the work-energy theorem says its initial kinetic energy is equal to the average stopping force times the
distance penetrated. The change in the bullet's kinetic energy and the net work done stopping it are both negative,
so when you write out the work-energy theorem, with the net work equal to the average force times the stopping
distance, that's what you get. The total thickness of eight 1-inch pine boards that the bullet penetrates is

Solution
Applying the work-energy theorem, we get

so

Significance
We could have used Newton's second law and kinematics in this example, but the work-energy theorem also
supplies an answer to less simple situations. The penetration of a bullet, fired vertically upward into a block of wood,
is discussed in one section of Asif Shakur's recent article ["Bullet-Block Science Video Puzzle." The Physics Teacher
(January 2015) 53(1): 15-16]. If the bullet is fired dead center into the block, it loses all its kinetic energy and
penetrates slightly farther than if fired off-center. The reason is that if the bullet hits off-center, it has a little kinetic
energy after it stops penetrating, because the block rotates. The work-energy theorem implies that a smaller change
in kinetic energy results in a smaller penetration. You will understand more of the physics in this interesting article
after you finish reading Angular Momentum.

     7.4 Power

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Relate the work done during a time interval to the power delivered
         · Find the power expended by a force acting on a moving body

     The concept of work involves force and displacement; the work-energy theorem relates the net work done on a body
     to the difference in its kinetic energy, calculated between two points on its trajectory. None of these quantities or
     relations involves time explicitly, yet we know that the time available to accomplish a particular amount of work is
     frequently just as important to us as the amount itself. In the chapter-opening figure, several sprinters may have
     achieved the same velocity at the finish, and therefore did the same amount of work, but the winner of the race did it
     in the least amount of time.

     We express the relation between work done and the time interval involved in doing it, by introducing the concept of
     power. Since work can vary as a function of time, we first define average power as the work done during a time
     interval, divided by the interval,

                                                                                                                                                          7.10

     Then, we can define the instantaneous power (frequently referred to as just plain power).

       POWER

       Power is defined as the rate of doing work, or the limit of the average power for time intervals approaching zero,
                                                                                                                                                       7.11

     If the power is constant over a time interval, the average power for that interval equals the instantaneous power,

     and the work done by the agent supplying the power is  . If the power during an interval varies with time,

     then the work done is the time integral of the power,

     The work-energy theorem relates how work can be transformed into kinetic energy. Since there are other forms of

     energy as well, as we discuss in the next chapter, we can also define power as the rate of transfer of energy. Work

     and energy are measured in units of joules, so power is measured in units of joules per second, which has been

     given the SI name watts, abbreviation W:               . Another common unit for expressing the power capability of

     everyday devices is horsepower:           .

The power involved in moving a body can also be expressed in terms of the forces acting on it. If a force acts on a
body that is displaced in a time dt, the power expended by the force is

                                                                                                                                                     7.12

                         FIGURE 7.15 We want to calculate the power needed to move a car up a hill at constant speed.

     Strategy

     At constant velocity, there is no change in kinetic energy, so the net work done to move the car is zero. Therefore the

     power supplied by the engine to move the car equals the power expended against gravity and air resistance. By

     assumption, 75% of the power is supplied against gravity, which equals                    where is the angle of

     the incline. A 15% grade means             This reasoning allows us to solve for the power required.

     or

     or about 78 hp. (You should supply the steps used to convert units.)

     Significance

     This is a reasonable amount of power for the engine of a small to mid-size car to supply                          Note

     that this is only the power expended to move the car. Much of the engine's power goes elsewhere, for example, into

     waste heat. That's why cars need radiators. Any remaining power could be used for acceleration, or to operate the

     car's accessories.

8.5 Sources of Energy

INTRODUCTION In George Rhoads' rolling ball sculpture, the principle of conservation of energy governs the
changes in the ball's kinetic energy and relates them to changes and transfers for other types of energy associated
with the ball's interactions. In this chapter, we introduce the important concept of potential energy. This will enable
us to formulate the law of conservation of mechanical energy and to apply it to simple systems, making solving
problems easier. In the final section on sources of energy, we will consider energy transfers and the general law of
conservation of energy. Throughout this book, the law of conservation of energy will be applied in increasingly more
detail, as you encounter more complex and varied systems, and other forms of energy.

8.1 Potential Energy of a System

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Relate the difference of potential energy to work done on a particle for a system without friction or air
        drag

    · Explain the meaning of the zero of the potential energy function for a system
    · Calculate and apply the gravitational potential energy for an object near Earth's surface and the elastic

        potential energy of a mass-spring system
In Work, we saw that the work done on an object by the constant gravitational force, near the surface of Earth, over
340  8 · Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

     any displacement is a function only of the difference in the positions of the end-points of the displacement. This
     property allows us to define a different kind of energy for the system than its kinetic energy, which is called
     potential energy. We consider various properties and types of potential energy in the following subsections.

     Potential Energy Basics

     In Motion in Two and Three Dimensions, we analyzed the motion of a projectile, like kicking a football in Figure 8.2.
     For this example, let's ignore friction and air resistance and begin the analysis immediately after the kick, at the start
     of the projectile motion of the ball. As the football rises, the work done by the gravitational force on the football is
     negative, because the ball's displacement is positive vertically and the force due to gravity is negative vertically. We
     also noted that the ball slowed down until it reached its highest point in the motion, thereby decreasing the ball's
     kinetic energy. This loss in kinetic energy translates to a gain in gravitational potential energy of the football-Earth
     system.

     As the football falls toward Earth, the work done on the football is now positive, because the displacement and the
     gravitational force both point vertically downward. The ball also speeds up, which indicates an increase in kinetic
     energy. Therefore, energy is converted from gravitational potential energy back into kinetic energy.

       FIGURE 8.2 As a football starts its descent toward the wide receiver, gravitational potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy.

     Based on this scenario, we can define the difference of potential energy from point A to point B as the negative of
     the work done:

     This formula explicitly states a potential energy difference, not just an absolute potential energy. Therefore, we
     need to define potential energy at a given position in such a way as to state standard values of potential energy on
     their own, rather than potential energy differences. We do this by rewriting the potential energy function in terms of
     an arbitrary constant,

                                                                                                                                                            8.2

     The choice of the potential energy at a starting location of is made out of convenience in the given problem. Most
     importantly, whatever choice is made should be stated and kept consistent throughout the given problem. There are
     some well-accepted choices of initial potential energy. For example, the lowest height in a problem is usually
     defined as zero potential energy, or if an object is in space, the farthest point away from the system is often defined
     as zero potential energy. Then, the potential energy, with respect to zero at is just
     As long as there is no friction or air resistance, the change in kinetic energy of the football equals negative of the
     change in gravitational potential energy of the football. This can be generalized to any potential energy:

Let's look at a specific example, choosing zero potential energy for gravitational potential energy at convenient
points.

Basic Properties of Potential Energy

A particle moves along the x-axis under the action of a force given by                , where      . (a) What is the

difference in its potential energy as it moves from     to                       ? (b) What is the particle's potential energy

at        with respect to a given 0.5 J of potential energy at            ?

Strategy

(a) The difference in potential energy is the negative of the work done, as defined by Equation 8.1. The work is

defined in the previous chapter as the dot product of the force with the distance. Since the particle is moving

forward in the x-direction, the dot product simplifies to a multiplication (          ). To find the total work done, we

need to integrate the function between the given limits. After integration, we can state the work or the change in

potential energy. (b) The potential energy function, with respect to zero at          , is the indefinite integral

encountered in part (a), with the constant of integration determined from Equation 8.3. Then, we substitute the

x-value into the function of potential energy to calculate the potential energy at

Solution

    a. The work done by the given force as the particle moves from coordinate x to             in one dimension is

    Substituting this expression into Equation 8.1, we obtain

    b. The indefinite integral for the potential energy function in part (a) is

In this one-dimensional example, any function we can integrate, independent of path, is conservative. Notice how

we applied the definition of potential energy difference to determine the potential energy function with respect to

342  8 · Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

     Systems of Several Particles

     In general, a system of interest could consist of several particles. The difference in the potential energy of the
     system is the negative of the work done by gravitational or elastic forces, which, as we will see in the next section,
     are conservative forces. The potential energy difference depends only on the initial and final positions of the
     particles, and on some parameters that characterize the interaction (like mass for gravity or the spring constant for a
     Hooke's law force).

     It is important to remember that potential energy is a property of the interactions between objects in a chosen
     system, and not just a property of each object. This is especially true for electric forces, although in the examples of
     potential energy we consider below, parts of the system are either so big (like Earth, compared to an object on its
     surface) or so small (like a massless spring), that the changes those parts undergo are negligible when included in
     the system.

     Types of Potential Energy

     For each type of interaction present in a system, you can label a corresponding type of potential energy. The total
     potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all the types. (This follows from the additive
     property of the dot product in the expression for the work done.) Let's look at some specific examples of types of
     potential energy discussed in Work. First, we consider each of these forces when acting separately, and then when
     both act together.

     Gravitational potential energy near Earth's surface
     The system of interest consists of our planet, Earth, and one or more particles near its surface (or bodies small
     enough to be considered as particles, compared to Earth). The gravitational force on each particle (or body) is just
     its weight mg near the surface of Earth, acting vertically down. According to Newton's third law, each particle exerts
     a force on Earth of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction. Newton's second law tells us that the magnitude
     of the acceleration produced by each of these forces on Earth is mg divided by Earth's mass. Since the ratio of the
     mass of any ordinary object to the mass of Earth is vanishingly small, the motion of Earth can be completely
     neglected. Therefore, we consider this system to be a group of single-particle systems, subject to the uniform
     gravitational force of Earth.

     In Work, the work done on a body by Earth's uniform gravitational force, near its surface, depended on the mass of
     the body, the acceleration due to gravity, and the difference in height the body traversed, as given by Equation 7.4.
     By definition, this work is the negative of the difference in the gravitational potential energy, so that difference is

                                                                                                                                                            8.4

     You can see from this that the gravitational potential energy function, near Earth's surface, is

                                                                                                                                                            8.5

     You can choose the value of the constant, as described in the discussion of Equation 8.2; however, for solving most

     problems, the most convenient constant to choose is zero for when  which is the lowest vertical position in

     the problem.

             EXAMPLE 8.2

     Gravitational Potential Energy of a Hiker

     The summit of Great Blue Hill in Milton, MA, is 147 m above its base and has an elevation above sea level of 195 m
     (Figure 8.3). (Its Native American name, Massachusett, was adopted by settlers for naming the Bay Colony and state
     near its location.) A 75-kg hiker ascends from the base to the summit. What is the gravitational potential energy of
     the hiker-Earth system with respect to zero gravitational potential energy at base height, when the hiker is (a) at the
     base of the hill, (b) at the summit, and (c) at sea level, afterward?

Strategy
First, we need to pick an origin for the y-axis and then determine the value of the constant that makes the potential
energy zero at the height of the base. Then, we can determine the potential energies from Equation 8.5, based on
the relationship between the zero potential energy height and the height at which the hiker is located.

Solution

  a. Let's choose the origin for the y-axis at base height, where we also want the zero of potential energy to be.
        This choice makes the constant equal to zero and

b. At the summit,  , so

c. At sea level,         , so

Significance

Besides illustrating the use of Equation 8.4 and Equation 8.5, the values of gravitational potential energy we found
are reasonable. The gravitational potential energy is higher at the summit than at the base, and lower at sea level
than at the base. Gravity does work on you on your way up, too! It does negative work and not quite as much (in
magnitude), as your muscles do. But it certainly does work. Similarly, your muscles do work on your way down, as
negative work. The numerical values of the potential energies depend on the choice of zero of potential energy, but
the physically meaningful differences of potential energy do not. [Note that since Equation 8.2 is a difference, the
numerical values do not depend on the origin of coordinates.]

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 8.2

What are the values of the gravitational potential energy of the hiker at the base, summit, and sea level, with respect
to a sea-level zero of potential energy?

Elastic potential energy
In Work, we saw that the work done by a perfectly elastic spring, in one dimension, depends only on the spring
constant and the squares of the displacements from the unstretched position, as given in Equation 7.5. This work
involves only the properties of a Hooke's law interaction and not the properties of real springs and whatever objects
are attached to them. Therefore, we can define the difference of elastic potential energy for a spring force as the
negative of the work done by the spring force in this equation, before we consider systems that embody this type of
force. Thus,

                                                                                                                                                       8.6

where the object travels from point A to point B. The potential energy function corresponding to this difference is

344  8 · Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

     If the spring force is the only force acting, it is simplest to take the zero of potential energy at  , when the spring

     is at its unstretched length. Then, the constant in Equation 8.7 is zero. (Other choices may be more convenient if

     other forces are acting.)

     EXAMPLE 8.3

     Spring Potential Energy

     A system contains a perfectly elastic spring, with an unstretched length of 20 cm and a spring constant of 4 N/cm.
     (a) How much elastic potential energy does the spring contribute when its length is 23 cm? (b) How much more
     potential energy does it contribute if its length increases to 26 cm?

     Strategy

     When the spring is at its unstretched length, it contributes nothing to the potential energy of the system, so we can
     use Equation 8.7 with the constant equal to zero. The value of x is the length minus the unstretched length. When
     the spring is expanded, the spring's displacement or difference between its relaxed length and stretched length
     should be used for the x-value in calculating the potential energy of the spring.

     Solution

     a. The displacement of the spring is                                      , so the contributed potential energy is
     b. When the spring's displacement is             .

                                                                                , the potential energy is
                                                      , which is a 0.54-J increase over the amount in part (a).

     Significance

     Calculating the elastic potential energy and potential energy differences from Equation 8.7 involves solving for the

     potential energies based on the given lengths of the spring. Since U depends on  , the potential energy for a
     compression (negative x) is the same as for an extension of equal magnitude.

FIGURE 8.4 A vertical mass-spring system, with the positive y-axis pointing upward. The mass is initially at an unstretched spring length,
point A. Then it is released, expanding past point B to point C, where it comes to a stop.

First, let's consider the potential energy of the system. We need to define the constant in the potential energy

function of Equation 8.5. Often, the ground is a suitable choice for when the gravitational potential energy is zero;

however, in this case, the highest point or when  is a convenient location for zero gravitational potential energy.

Note that this choice is arbitrary, and the problem can be solved correctly even if another choice is picked.

We must also define the elastic potential energy of the system and the corresponding constant, as detailed in

Equation 8.7. This is where the spring is unstretched, or at the  position.

If we consider that the total energy of the system is conserved, then the energy at point A equals point C. The block
is placed just on the spring so its initial kinetic energy is zero. By the setup of the problem discussed previously, both
the gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy are equal to zero. Therefore, the initial energy of the
system is zero. When the block arrives at point C, its kinetic energy is zero. However, it now has both gravitational
potential energy and elastic potential energy. Therefore, we can solve for the distance y that the block travels before
coming to a stop:

     the maximum expansion of the spring, as seen at point C? (b) What is the total potential energy at point B, halfway

     between A and C? (c) What is the speed of the block at point B?

     Strategy

     In part (a) we calculate the distance as discussed in the previous text. Then in part (b), we use half of the y value
     to calculate the potential energy at point B using equations Equation 8.4 and Equation 8.6. This energy must be
     equal to the kinetic energy, Equation 7.6, at point B since the initial energy of the system is zero. By calculating the
     kinetic energy at point B, we can now calculate the speed of the block at point B.

     Solution

     a. Since the total energy of the system is zero at point A as discussed previously, the maximum expansion of the
          spring is calculated to be:

     b. The position of is half of the position at or                   . The total potential energy at point B
          would therefore be:

The kinetic energy at point B therefore is 0.12 J because the total energy is zero. Therefore, the speed of the
block at point B is equal to

Even though the potential energy due to gravity is relative to a chosen zero location, the solutions to this problem

     8.2 Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Characterize a conservative force in several different ways
         · Specify mathematical conditions that must be satisfied by a conservative force and its components
         · Relate the conservative force between particles of a system to the potential energy of the system
         · Calculate the components of a conservative force in various cases

     In the interactions we considered in Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy, any transition between kinetic
     and potential energy did not change the total energy of the system. This was path independent, meaning that we
     can start and stop at any two points in the problem, and the total energy of the system--kinetic plus potential--at
     these points are equal to each other. This is characteristic of a conservative force. We dealt with conservative
     forces in the preceding section, such as the gravitational force and spring force. When comparing the motion of the
     football in Figure 8.2, the total energy of the system never changes, even though the gravitational potential energy of
     the football increases, as the ball rises relative to ground and falls back to the initial gravitational potential energy
     when the football player catches the ball. Non-conservative forces are dissipative forces such as friction or air
     resistance. These forces take energy away from the system as the system progresses, energy that you can't get
     back. These forces are path dependent; therefore it matters where the object starts and stops.

     CONSERVATIVE FORCE

     The work done by a conservative force is independent of the path; in other words, the work done by a
     conservative force is the same for any path connecting two points:

                                                                                                                                                      8.8

     The work done by a non-conservative force depends on the path taken.
     Equivalently, a force is conservative if the work it does around any closed path is zero:

                                                                                                                                                      8.9

     [In Equation 8.9, we use the notation of a circle in the middle of the integral sign for a line integral over a closed
     path, a notation found in most physics and engineering texts.] Equation 8.8 and Equation 8.9 are equivalent because
     any closed path is the sum of two paths: the first going from A to B, and the second going from B to A. The work
     done going along a path from B to A is the negative of the work done going along the same path from A to B, where A

and B are any two points on the closed path:

You might ask how we go about proving whether or not a force is conservative, since the definitions involve any and

all paths from A to B, or any and all closed paths, but to do the integral for the work, you have to choose a particular

path. One answer is that the work done is independent of path if the infinitesimal work  is an exact

differential, the way the infinitesimal net work was equal to the exact differential of the kinetic energy,

when we derived the work-energy theorem in Work-Energy Theorem. There are mathematical conditions that you

can use to test whether the infinitesimal work done by a force is an exact differential, and the force is conservative.

These conditions only involve differentiation and are thus relatively easy to apply. In two dimensions, the condition

for               to be an exact differential is

                                                                                                             8.10

     potential energy or work calculations always yields the same results.

     Significance
     The conditions in Equation 8.10 are derivatives as functions of a single variable; in three dimensions, similar
     conditions exist that involve more derivatives.

     A two-dimensional, conservative force is zero on the x- and y-axes, and satisfies the condition
                                                          . What is the magnitude of the force at the point

     Before leaving this section, we note that non-conservative forces do not have potential energy associated with them
     because the energy is lost to the system and can't be turned into useful work later. So there is always a conservative
     force associated with every potential energy. We have seen that potential energy is defined in relation to the work
     done by conservative forces. That relation, Equation 8.1, involved an integral for the work; starting with the force
     and displacement, you integrated to get the work and the change in potential energy. However, integration is the
     inverse operation of differentiation; you could equally well have started with the potential energy and taken its
     derivative, with respect to displacement, to get the force. The infinitesimal increment of potential energy is the dot
     product of the force and the infinitesimal displacement,

     Here, we chose to represent the displacement in an arbitrary direction by so as not to be restricted to any
     particular coordinate direction. We also expressed the dot product in terms of the magnitude of the infinitesimal
     displacement and the component of the force in its direction. Both these quantities are scalars, so you can divide by
     dl to get

                                                                                                                                                          8.11

     This equation gives the relation between force and the potential energy associated with it. In words, the component
     of a conservative force, in a particular direction, equals the negative of the derivative of the corresponding potential
     energy, with respect to a displacement in that direction. For one-dimensional motion, say along the x-axis, Equation
     8.11 give the entire vector force,

     In two dimensions,

     From this equation, you can see why Equation 8.11 is the condition for the work to be an exact differential, in terms

of the derivatives of the components of the force. In general, a partial derivative notation is used. If a function has
many variables in it, the derivative is taken only of the variable the partial derivative specifies. The other variables
are held constant. In three dimensions, you add another term for the z-component, and the result is that the force is
the negative of the gradient of the potential energy. However, we won't be looking at three-dimensional examples
just yet.

Force due to a Quartic Potential Energy

The potential energy for a particle undergoing one-dimensional motion along the x-axis is

where     Its total energy at                  and it is not subject to any non-conservative forces. Find (a) the

positions where its kinetic energy is zero and (b) the forces at those positions.

Strategy

(a) We can find the positions where  so the potential energy equals the total energy of the given system. (b)

Using Equation 8.11, we can find the force evaluated at the positions found from the previous part, since the

mechanical energy is conserved.

Solution

a. The total energy of the system of 2 J equals the quartic elastic energy as given in the problem,

     Solving for results in
b. From Equation 8.11,

Thus, evaluating the force at        , we get

        At both positions, the magnitude of the forces is 8 N and the directions are toward the origin, since this is the
        potential energy for a restoring force.

Significance
Finding the force from the potential energy is mathematically easier than finding the potential energy from the force,
because differentiating a function is generally easier than integrating one.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Formulate the principle of conservation of mechanical energy, with or without the presence of non-
        conservative forces

    · Use the conservation of mechanical energy to calculate various properties of simple systems

In this section, we elaborate and extend the result we derived in Potential Energy of a System, where we re-wrote
the work-energy theorem in terms of the change in the kinetic and potential energies of a particle. This will lead us
to a discussion of the important principle of the conservation of mechanical energy. As you continue to examine
352  8 · Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

     other topics in physics, in later chapters of this book, you will see how this conservation law is generalized to
     encompass other types of energy and energy transfers. The last section of this chapter provides a preview.

     The terms `conserved quantity' and `conservation law' have specific, scientific meanings in physics, which are
     different from the everyday meanings associated with the use of these words. (The same comment is also true
     about the scientific and everyday uses of the word `work.') In everyday usage, you could conserve water by not using
     it, or by using less of it, or by re-using it. Water is composed of molecules consisting of two atoms of hydrogen and
     one of oxygen. Bring these atoms together to form a molecule and you create water; dissociate the atoms in such a
     molecule and you destroy water. However, in scientific usage, a conserved quantity for a system stays constant,
     changes by a definite amount that is transferred to other systems, and/or is converted into other forms of that
     quantity. A conserved quantity, in the scientific sense, can be transformed, but not strictly created or destroyed.
     Thus, there is no physical law of conservation of water.

     Systems with a Single Particle or Object

     We first consider a system with a single particle or object. Returning to our development of Equation 8.2, recall that

     we first separated all the forces acting on a particle into conservative and non-conservative types, and wrote the

     work done by each type of force as a separate term in the work-energy theorem. We then replaced the work done by

     the conservative forces by the change in the potential energy of the particle, combining it with the change in the

     particle's kinetic energy to get Equation 8.2. Now, we write this equation without the middle step and define the sum

     of the kinetic and potential energies,           to be the mechanical energy of the particle.

     CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

     The mechanical energy E of a particle stays constant unless forces outside the system or non-conservative
     forces do work on it, in which case, the change in the mechanical energy is equal to the work done by the non-
     conservative forces:

                                                                                                                                                     8.12

     This statement expresses the concept of energy conservation for a classical particle as long as there is no non-
     conservative work. Recall that a classical particle is just a point mass, is nonrelativistic, and obeys Newton's laws of
     motion. In Relativity (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/5-introduction), we will see
     that conservation of energy still applies to a non-classical particle, but for that to happen, we have to make a slight
     adjustment to the definition of energy.

     It is sometimes convenient to separate the case where the work done by non-conservative forces is zero, either
     because no such forces are assumed present, or, like the normal force, they do zero work when the motion is
     parallel to the surface. Then

                                                                                                                                                          8.13

     In this case, the conservation of mechanical energy can be expressed as follows: The mechanical energy of a
     particle does not change if all the non-conservative forces that may act on it do no work. Understanding the concept
     of energy conservation is the important thing, not the particular equation you use to express it.

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Conservation of Energy

       1. Identify the body or bodies to be studied (the system). Often, in applications of the principle of mechanical
             energy conservation, we study more than one body at the same time.

       2. Identify all forces acting on the body or bodies.
       3. Determine whether each force that does work is conservative. If a non-conservative force (e.g., friction) is

             doing work, then mechanical energy is not conserved. The system must then be analyzed with non-

     conservative work, Equation 8.12.
4. For every conservative force that does work, choose a reference point and determine the potential energy

     function for the force. The reference points for the various potential energies do not have to be at the same
     location.
5. If no non-conservative work is done, apply the principle of mechanical energy conservation by setting the sum
     of the kinetic energies and potential energies equal at every point of interest.

        EXAMPLE 8.7

Simple Pendulum

A particle of mass m is hung from the ceiling by a massless string of length 1.0 m, as shown in Figure 8.7. The
particle is released from rest, when the angle between the string and the downward vertical direction is What is
its speed when it reaches the lowest point of its arc?

FIGURE 8.7 A particle hung from a string constitutes a simple pendulum. It is shown when released from rest, along with some distances
used in analyzing the motion.

Strategy

Using our problem-solving strategy, the first step is to define that we are interested in the particle-Earth system.

Second, only the gravitational force is acting on the particle, which is conservative (step 3). We neglect air resistance

in the problem, and no work is done by the string tension, which is perpendicular to the arc of the motion. Therefore,

the mechanical energy of the system is conserved, as represented by Equation 8.13,                        . Because the

particle starts from rest, the increase in the kinetic energy is just the kinetic energy at the lowest point. This increase

in kinetic energy equals the decrease in the gravitational potential energy, which we can calculate from the

geometry. In step 4, we choose a reference point for zero gravitational potential energy to be at the lowest vertical

point the particle achieves, which is mid-swing. Lastly, in step 5, we set the sum of energies at the highest point

(initial) of the swing to the lowest point (final) of the swing to ultimately solve for the final speed.

Solution
We are neglecting non-conservative forces, so we write the energy conservation formula relating the particle at the
highest point (initial) and the lowest point in the swing (final) as

Since the particle is released from rest, the initial kinetic energy is zero. At the lowest point, we define the
gravitational potential energy to be zero. Therefore our conservation of energy formula reduces to

The vertical height of the particle is not given directly in the problem. This can be solved for by using trigonometry
and two givens: the length of the pendulum and the angle through which the particle is vertically pulled up. Looking
at the diagram, the vertical dashed line is the length of the pendulum string. The vertical height is labeled h. The
354  8 · Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

     other partial length of the vertical string can be calculated with trigonometry. That piece is solved for by

     Therefore, by looking at the two parts of the string, we can solve for the height h,

     We substitute this height into the previous expression solved for speed to calculate our result:

     Significance
     We found the speed directly from the conservation of mechanical energy, without having to solve the differential
     equation for the motion of a pendulum (see Oscillations). We can approach this problem in terms of bar graphs of
     total energy. Initially, the particle has all potential energy, being at the highest point, and no kinetic energy. When
     the particle crosses the lowest point at the bottom of the swing, the energy moves from the potential energy column
     to the kinetic energy column. Therefore, we can imagine a progression of this transfer as the particle moves
     between its highest point, lowest point of the swing, and back to the highest point (Figure 8.8). As the particle
     travels from the lowest point in the swing to the highest point on the far right hand side of the diagram, the energy
     bars go in reverse order from (c) to (b) to (a).

     FIGURE 8.8 Bar graphs representing the total energy (E), potential energy (U), and kinetic energy (K) of the particle in different positions.
     (a) The total energy of the system equals the potential energy and the kinetic energy is zero, which is found at the highest point the particle
     reaches. (b) The particle is midway between the highest and lowest point, so the kinetic energy plus potential energy bar graphs equal the
     total energy. (c) The particle is at the lowest point of the swing, so the kinetic energy bar graph is the highest and equal to the total energy
     of the system.

FIGURE 8.9 A helicopter loses a panel that falls until it reaches terminal velocity of 45 m/s. How much did air resistance contribute to the
dissipation of energy in this problem?

Strategy
Step 1: Here only one body is being investigated.

Step 2: Gravitational force is acting on the panel, as well as air resistance, which is stated in the problem.

Step 3: Gravitational force is conservative; however, the non-conservative force of air resistance does negative work
on the falling panel, so we can use the conservation of mechanical energy, in the form expressed by Equation 8.12,
to find the energy dissipated. This energy is the magnitude of the work:

Step 4: The initial kinetic energy, at  is zero. We set the gravitational potential energy to zero at ground
level out of convenience.

Step 5: The non-conservative work is set equal to the energies to solve for the work dissipated by air resistance.

Solution
The mechanical energy dissipated by air resistance is the algebraic sum of the gain in the kinetic energy and loss in
potential energy. Therefore the calculation of this energy is

Significance
Most of the initial mechanical energy of the panel , 147 kJ, was lost to air resistance. Notice that we were able
to calculate the energy dissipated without knowing what the force of air resistance was, only that it was dissipative.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 8.8

You probably recall that, neglecting air resistance, if you throw a projectile straight up, the time it takes to reach its
maximum height equals the time it takes to fall from the maximum height back to the starting height. Suppose you
356  8 · Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

     cannot neglect air resistance, as in Example 8.8. Is the time the projectile takes to go up (a) greater than, (b) less
     than, or (c) equal to the time it takes to come back down? Explain.

     In these examples, we were able to use conservation of energy to calculate the speed of a particle just at particular
     points in its motion. But the method of analyzing particle motion, starting from energy conservation, is more
     powerful than that. More advanced treatments of the theory of mechanics allow you to calculate the full time
     dependence of a particle's motion, for a given potential energy. In fact, it is often the case that a better model for
     particle motion is provided by the form of its kinetic and potential energies, rather than an equation for force acting
     on it. (This is especially true for the quantum mechanical description of particles like electrons or atoms.)

     We can illustrate some of the simplest features of this energy-based approach by considering a particle in one-
     dimensional motion, with potential energy U(x) and no non-conservative interactions present. Equation 8.12 and the
     definition of velocity require

     Separate the variables x and t and integrate, from an initial time  to an arbitrary time, to get

                                                                                                                       8.14

     If you can do the integral in Equation 8.14, then you can solve for x as a function of t.

     function of time t.

     Strategy

     Since we know how the potential energy changes as a function of x, we can substitute for   in Equation 8.14,

     integrate, and then solve for x. This results in an expression of x as a function of time with constants of energy E,

     mass m, and the initial position

     Solution
     Following the first two suggested steps in the above strategy,

     Solving for the position, we obtain                             .

     The position as a function of time, for this potential, represents one-dimensional motion with constant acceleration,

We will look at another more physically appropriate example of the use of Equation 8.13 after we have explored
some further implications that can be drawn from the functional form of a particle's potential energy.

Systems with Several Particles or Objects

Systems generally consist of more than one particle or object. However, the conservation of mechanical energy, in
one of the forms in Equation 8.12 or Equation 8.13, is a fundamental law of physics and applies to any system. You
just have to include the kinetic and potential energies of all the particles, and the work done by all the non-
conservative forces acting on them. Until you learn more about the dynamics of systems composed of many
particles, in Linear Momentum and Collisions, Fixed-Axis Rotation, and Angular Momentum, it is better to postpone
discussing the application of energy conservation to then.

8.4 Potential Energy Diagrams and Stability

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Create and interpret graphs of potential energy
    · Explain the connection between stability and potential energy

Often, you can get a good deal of useful information about the dynamical behavior of a mechanical system just by
interpreting a graph of its potential energy as a function of position, called a potential energy diagram. This is most
easily accomplished for a one-dimensional system, whose potential energy can be plotted in one two-dimensional
graph--for example, U(x) versus x--on a piece of paper or a computer program. For systems whose motion is in more
than one dimension, the motion needs to be studied in three-dimensional space. We will simplify our procedure for
one-dimensional motion only.

First, let's look at an object, freely falling vertically, near the surface of Earth, in the absence of air resistance. The

mechanical energy of the object is conserved,               and the potential energy, with respect to zero at ground

level, is  which is a straight line through the origin with slope . In the graph shown in Figure 8.10,

the x-axis is the height above the ground y and the y-axis is the object's energy.

                      FIGURE 8.10 The potential energy graph for an object in vertical free fall, with various quantities indicated.

The line at energy E represents the constant mechanical energy of the object, whereas the kinetic and potential
energies, and are indicated at a particular height You can see how the total energy is divided between
kinetic and potential energy as the object's height changes. Since kinetic energy can never be negative, there is a
maximum potential energy and a maximum height, which an object with the given total energy cannot exceed:

If we use the gravitational potential energy reference point of zero at  we can rewrite the gravitational potential
energy U as mgy. Solving for y results in
358  8 · Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

     We note in this expression that the quantity of the total energy divided by the weight (mg) is located at the

     maximum height of the particle, or  At the maximum height, the kinetic energy and the speed are zero, so if the

     object were initially traveling upward, its velocity would go through zero there, and  would be a turning point in

     the motion. At ground level,        , the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy and the speed are

     maximum:

     The maximum speed gives the initial velocity necessary to reach               the maximum height, and

     represents the final velocity, after falling from  You can read all this information, and more, from the potential

     energy diagram we have shown.

     Consider a mass-spring system on a frictionless, stationary, horizontal surface, so that gravity and the normal

     contact force do no work and can be ignored (Figure 8.11). This is like a one-dimensional system, whose mechanical

     energy E is a constant and whose potential energy, with respect to zero energy at zero displacement from the

     spring's unstretched length,                       .

     FIGURE 8.11 (a) A glider between springs on an air track is an example of a horizontal mass-spring system. (b) The potential energy
     diagram for this system, with various quantities indicated.

     You can read off the same type of information from the potential energy diagram in this case, as in the case for the

     body in vertical free fall, but since the spring potential energy describes a variable force, you can learn more from

     this graph. As for the object in vertical free fall, you can deduce the physically allowable range of motion and the

     maximum values of distance and speed, from the limits on the kinetic energy,                  Therefore,       and

     at a turning point, of which there are two for the elastic spring potential energy,

     The glider's motion is confined to the region between the turning points,                     This is true for any

     (positive) value of E because the potential energy is unbounded with respect to x. For this reason, as well as the

     shape of the potential energy curve, U(x) is called an infinite potential well. At the bottom of the potential well,

               and the kinetic energy is a maximum,

     However, from the slope of this potential energy curve, you can also deduce information about the force on the

     glider and its acceleration. We saw earlier that the negative of the slope of the potential energy is the spring force,

     which in this case is also the net force, and thus is proportional to the acceleration. When  , the slope, the

     force, and the acceleration are all zero, so this is an equilibrium point. The negative of the slope, on either side of

     the equilibrium point, gives a force pointing back to the equilibrium point,           so the equilibrium is termed

     stable and the force is called a restoring force. This implies that U(x) has a relative minimum there. If the force on

either side of an equilibrium point has a direction that is the same as the direction of position change, pointing away
from the equilibrium point, the equilibrium is termed unstable, and this implies that U(x) has a relative maximum
there.

EXAMPLE 8.10

Quartic and Quadratic Potential Energy Diagram

The potential energy for a particle undergoing one-dimensional motion along the x-axis is

where U is in joules and x is in meters. The particle is not subject to any non-conservative forces and its mechanical

energy is constant at            . (a) Is the motion of the particle confined to any regions on the x-axis, and if so,

what are they? (b) Are there any equilibrium points, and if so, where are they and are they stable or unstable?

Strategy

First, we need to graph the potential energy as a function of x. The function is zero at the origin, becomes negative

as x increases in the positive or negative directions ( is larger than for  ), and then becomes positive at

sufficiently large . Your graph should look like a double potential well, with the zeros determined by solving the

equation        , and the extremes determined by examining the first and second derivatives of U(x), as shown in

You can find the values of (a) the allowed regions along the x-axis, for the given value of the mechanical energy, from
the condition that the kinetic energy can't be negative, and (b) the equilibrium points and their stability from the
properties of the force (stable for a relative minimum and unstable for a relative maximum of potential energy).

You can just eyeball the graph to reach qualitative answers to the questions in this example. That, after all, is the

value of potential energy diagrams. You can see that there are two allowed regions for the motion  and

three equilibrium points (slope  of which the central one is unstable                              and the other

two are stable

Solution

a. To find the allowed regions for x, we use the condition

     If we complete the square in , this condition simplifies to        which we can solve to obtain

     This represents two allowed regions,                     and       where                            and

     (in meters).

     b. To find the equilibrium points, we solve the equation

     and find        and              , where                           (meters). The second derivative

     is negative at       , so that position is a relative maximum and the equilibrium there is unstable. The second

     derivative is positive at        , so these positions are relative minima and represent stable equilibria.

     Significance

     The particle in this example can oscillate in the allowed region about either of the two stable equilibrium points we
     found, but it does not have enough energy to escape from whichever potential well it happens to initially be in. The
     conservation of mechanical energy and the relations between kinetic energy and speed, and potential energy and
     force, enable you to deduce much information about the qualitative behavior of the motion of a particle, as well as
     some quantitative information, from a graph of its potential energy.

8.5 Sources of Energy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe energy transformations and conversions in general terms
    · Explain what it means for an energy source to be renewable or nonrenewable

In this chapter, we have studied energy. We learned that energy can take different forms and can be transferred
from one form to another. You will find that energy is discussed in many everyday, as well as scientific, contexts,
because it is involved in all physical processes. It will also become apparent that many situations are best
understood, or most easily conceptualized, by considering energy. So far, no experimental results have contradicted
the conservation of energy. In fact, whenever measurements have appeared to conflict with energy conservation,
new forms of energy have been discovered or recognized in accordance with this principle.

What are some other forms of energy? Many of these are covered in later chapters (also see Figure 8.13), but let's
detail a few here:

    · Atoms and molecules inside all objects are in random motion. The internal kinetic energy from these random
       motions is called thermal energy, because it is related to the temperature of the object. In this case, the
       energy is known as heat energy.

    · Electrical energy is a common form that is converted to many other forms and does work in a wide range of
        practical situations.

    · Fuels, such as gasoline and food, have chemical energy, which is potential energy arising from their molecular
        structure. Chemical energy can be converted into thermal energy by reactions like oxidation. Chemical
        reactions can also produce electrical energy, such as in batteries. Electrical energy can, in turn, produce
        thermal energy and light, such as in an electric heater or a light bulb.

    · Light is just one kind of electromagnetic radiation, or radiant energy, which also includes radio, infrared,
        ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. All bodies with thermal energy can radiate energy in electromagnetic
        waves.

    · Nuclear energy comes from reactions and processes that convert measurable amounts of mass into energy.
        Nuclear energy is transformed into radiant energy in the Sun, into thermal energy in the boilers of nuclear
        power plants, and then into electrical energy in the generators of power plants. These and all other forms of
        energy can be transformed into one another and, to a certain degree, can be converted into mechanical work.
362  8 · Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

     FIGURE 8.13 Energy that we use in society takes many forms, which be converted from one into another depending on the process
     involved. We will study many of these forms of energy in later chapters in this text. (credit "sun": modification of work by EIT - SOHO
     Consortium, ESA, NASA credit "solar panels": "modification of work by "kjkolb"/Wikimedia Commons; credit "gas burner": modification of
     work by Steven Depolo)

     The transformation of energy from one form into another happens all the time. The chemical energy in food is
     converted into thermal energy through metabolism; light energy is converted into chemical energy through
     photosynthesis. Another example of energy conversion occurs in a solar cell. Sunlight impinging on a solar cell
     produces electricity, which can be used to run electric motors or heat water. In an example encompassing many
     steps, the chemical energy contained in coal is converted into thermal energy as it burns in a furnace, to transform
     water into steam, in a boiler. Some of the thermal energy in the steam is then converted into mechanical energy as it
     expands and spins a turbine, which is connected to a generator to produce electrical energy. In these examples, not
     all of the initial energy is converted into the forms mentioned, because some energy is always transferred to the
     environment.

     Energy is an important element at all levels of society. We live in a very interdependent world, and access to
     adequate and reliable energy resources is crucial for economic growth and for maintaining the quality of our lives.
     The principal energy resources used in the world are shown in Figure 8.14. The figure distinguishes between two
     major types of energy sources: renewable and non-renewable, and further divides each type into a few more
     specific kinds. Renewable sources are energy sources that are replenished through naturally occurring, ongoing
     processes, on a time scale that is much shorter than the anticipated lifetime of the civilization using the source.
     Non-renewable sources are depleted once some of the energy they contain is extracted and converted into other
     kinds of energy. The natural processes by which non-renewable sources are formed typically take place over
     geological time scales.

          FIGURE 8.14 World energy consumption by source; the percentage of renewables is increasing, accounting for 19% in 2012.

Our most important non-renewable energy sources are fossil fuels, such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas. These
account for about 81% of the world's energy consumption, as shown in the figure. Burning fossil fuels creates
chemical reactions that transform potential energy, in the molecular structures of the reactants, into thermal energy
and products. This thermal energy can be used to heat buildings or to operate steam-driven machinery. Internal
combustion and jet engines convert some of the energy of rapidly expanding gases, released from burning gasoline,
into mechanical work. Electrical power generation is mostly derived from transferring energy in expanding steam,
via turbines, into mechanical work, which rotates coils of wire in magnetic fields to generate electricity. Nuclear
energy is the other non-renewable source shown in Figure 8.14 and supplies about 3% of the world's consumption.
Nuclear reactions release energy by transforming potential energy, in the structure of nuclei, into thermal energy,
analogous to energy release in chemical reactions. The thermal energy obtained from nuclear reactions can be
transferred and converted into other forms in the same ways that energy from fossil fuels are used.

An unfortunate byproduct of relying on energy produced from the combustion of fossil fuels is the release of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere and its contribution to global warming. Nuclear energy poses environmental problems
as well, including the safety and disposal of nuclear waste. Besides these important consequences, reserves of non-
renewable sources of energy are limited and, given the rapidly growing rate of world energy consumption, may not
last for more than a few hundred years. Considerable effort is going on to develop and expand the use of renewable
sources of energy, involving a significant percentage of the world's physicists and engineers.

Four of the renewable energy sources listed in Figure 8.14--those using material from plants as fuel (biomass heat,
ethanol, biodiesel, and biomass electricity)--involve the same types of energy transformations and conversions as
just discussed for fossil and nuclear fuels. The other major types of renewable energy sources are hydropower, wind
power, geothermal power, and solar power.

Hydropower is produced by converting the gravitational potential energy of falling or flowing water into kinetic
energy and then into work to run electric generators or machinery. Converting the mechanical energy in ocean
surface waves and tides is in development. Wind power also converts kinetic energy into work, which can be used
directly to generate electricity, operate mills, and propel sailboats.

The interior of Earth has a great deal of thermal energy, part of which is left over from its original formation
(gravitational potential energy converted into thermal energy) and part of which is released from radioactive
minerals (a form of natural nuclear energy). It will take a very long time for this geothermal energy to escape into
space, so people generally regard it as a renewable source, when actually, it's just inexhaustible on human time
scales.

The source of solar power is energy carried by the electromagnetic waves radiated by the Sun. Most of this energy is
carried by visible light and infrared (heat) radiation. When suitable materials absorb electromagnetic waves, radiant
energy is converted into thermal energy, which can be used to heat water, or when concentrated, to make steam and
364  8 · Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

     generate electricity (Figure 8.15). However, in another important physical process, known as the photoelectric
     effect, energetic radiation impinging on certain materials is directly converted into electricity. Materials that do this
     are called photovoltaics (PV in Figure 8.14). Some solar power systems use lenses or mirrors to concentrate the
     Sun's rays, before converting their energy through photovoltaics, and these are qualified as CSP in Figure 8.14.

     FIGURE 8.15 Solar cell arrays found in a sunny area converting the solar energy into stored electrical energy. (credit: modification of work

     As we finish this chapter on energy and work, it is relevant to draw some distinctions between two sometimes
     misunderstood terms in the area of energy use. As we mentioned earlier, the "law of conservation of energy" is a
     very useful principle in analyzing physical processes. It cannot be proven from basic principles but is a very good
     bookkeeping device, and no exceptions have ever been found. It states that the total amount of energy in an isolated
     system always remains constant. Related to this principle, but remarkably different from it, is the important
     philosophy of energy conservation. This concept has to do with seeking to decrease the amount of energy used by
     an individual or group through reducing activities (e.g., turning down thermostats, driving fewer kilometers) and/or
     increasing conversion efficiencies in the performance of a particular task, such as developing and using more
     efficient room heaters, cars that have greater miles-per-gallon ratings, energy-efficient compact fluorescent lights,
     etc.

     Since energy in an isolated system is not destroyed, created, or generated, you might wonder why we need to be
     concerned about our energy resources, since energy is a conserved quantity. The problem is that the final result of
     most energy transformations is waste heat, that is, work that has been "degraded" in the energy transformation. We
     will discuss this idea in more detail in the chapters on thermodynamics.

INTRODUCTION The concepts of work, energy, and the work-energy theorem are valuable for two primary reasons:
First, they are powerful computational tools, making it much easier to analyze complex physical systems than is
possible using Newton's laws directly (for example, systems with nonconstant forces); and second, the observation
that the total energy of a closed system is conserved means that the system can only evolve in ways that are
consistent with energy conservation. In other words, a system cannot evolve randomly; it can only change in ways
that conserve energy.
In this chapter, we develop and define another conserved quantity, called linear momentum, and another
relationship (the impulse-momentum theorem), which will put an additional constraint on how a system evolves in
time. Conservation of momentum is useful for understanding collisions, such as that shown in the above image. It is
just as powerful, just as important, and just as useful as conservation of energy and the work-energy theorem.

     9.1 Linear Momentum

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain what momentum is, physically
         · Calculate the momentum of a moving object

     Our study of kinetic energy showed that a complete understanding of an object's motion must include both its mass

     and its velocity (  ). However, as powerful as this concept is, it does not include any information about

     the direction of the moving object's velocity vector. We'll now define a physical quantity that includes direction.

     Like kinetic energy, this quantity includes both mass and velocity; like kinetic energy, it is a way of characterizing the
     "quantity of motion" of an object. It is given the name momentum (from the Latin word movimentum, meaning
     "movement"), and it is represented by the symbol p.

     MOMENTUM

     The momentum p of an object is the product of its mass and its velocity:
                                                                                                                                                      9.1

        FIGURE 9.2 The velocity and momentum vectors for the ball are in the same direction. (credit: modification of work by Ben Sutherland)

     As shown in Figure 9.2, momentum is a vector quantity (since velocity is). This is one of the things that makes
     momentum useful and not a duplication of kinetic energy. It is perhaps most useful when determining whether an
     object's motion is difficult to change (Figure 9.3) or easy to change (Figure 9.4) over a short time interval.

FIGURE 9.3 This supertanker transports a huge mass of oil; as a consequence, it takes a long time for a force to change its (comparatively
small) velocity. (credit: modification of work by "the_tahoe_guy"/Flickr)

FIGURE 9.4 Gas molecules can have very large velocities, but these velocities change nearly instantaneously when they collide with the
container walls or with each other. This is primarily because their masses are so tiny.

Unlike kinetic energy, momentum depends equally on an object's mass and velocity. For example, as you will learn

when you study thermodynamics, the average speed of an air molecule at room temperature is approximately 500

m/s, with an average molecular mass of  ; its momentum is thus

For comparison, a typical automobile might have a speed of only 15 m/s, but a mass of 1400 kg, giving it a
momentum of

These momenta are different by 27 orders of magnitude, or a factor of a billion billion billion!

     9.2 Impulse and Collisions

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain what an impulse is, physically
         · Describe what an impulse does
         · Relate impulses to collisions
         · Apply the impulse-momentum theorem to solve problems

     We have defined momentum to be the product of mass and velocity. Therefore, if an object's velocity should change
     (due to the application of a force on the object), then necessarily, its momentum changes as well. This indicates a
     connection between momentum and force. The purpose of this section is to explore and describe that connection.

     Suppose you apply a force on a free object for some amount of time. Clearly, the larger the force, the larger the
     object's change of momentum will be. Alternatively, the more time you spend applying this force, again the larger
     the change of momentum will be, as depicted in Figure 9.5. The amount by which the object's motion changes is
     therefore proportional to the magnitude of the force, and also to the time interval over which the force is applied.

     FIGURE 9.5 The change in momentum of an object is proportional to the length of time during which the force is applied. If a force is
     exerted on the lower ball for twice as long as on the upper ball, then the change in the momentum of the lower ball is twice that of the
     upper ball.

     Mathematically, if a quantity is proportional to two (or more) things, then it is proportional to the product of those
     things. The product of a force and a time interval (over which that force acts) is called impulse, and is given the
     symbol

       IMPULSE

       Let be the force applied to an object over some differential time interval dt (Figure 9.6). The resulting
       impulse on the object is defined as

                                                                                                                                                         9.2

       FIGURE 9.6 A force applied by a tennis racquet to a tennis ball over a time interval generates an impulse acting on the ball.

The total impulse over the interval  is

                                                                                                                                      9.3

Equation 9.2 and Equation 9.3 together say that when a force is applied for an infinitesimal time interval dt, it

causes an infinitesimal impulse      , and the total impulse given to the object is defined to be the sum (integral) of all
these infinitesimal impulses.

To calculate the impulse using Equation 9.3, we need to know the force function F(t), which we often don't.
However, a result from calculus is useful here: Recall that the average value of a function over some interval is
calculated by

where  . Applying this to the time-dependent force function, we obtain

                                                                                                                                      9.4

Therefore, from Equation 9.3,
                                                                                                                                                       9.5

The idea here is that you can calculate the impulse on the object even if you don't know the details of the force as a
function of time; you only need the average force. In fact, though, the process is usually reversed: You determine the
impulse (by measurement or calculation) and then calculate the average force that caused that impulse.

To calculate the impulse, a useful result follows from writing the force in Equation 9.3 as  :
382  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     For a constant force                , this simplifies to

     That is,
                                                                                                                                                            9.6

     Note that the integral form, Equation 9.3, applies to constant forces as well; in that case, since the force is
     independent of time, it comes out of the integral, which can then be trivially evaluated.

     EXAMPLE 9.1

     The Arizona Meteor Crater

     Approximately 50,000 years ago, a large (radius of 25 m) iron-nickel meteorite collided with Earth at an estimated

     speed of              in what is now the northern Arizona desert, in the United States. The impact produced a

     crater that is still visible today (Figure 9.7); it is approximately 1200 m (three-quarters of a mile) in diameter, 170 m

     deep, and has a rim that rises 45 m above the surrounding desert plain. Iron-nickel meteorites typically have a

     density of            . Use impulse considerations to estimate the average force and the maximum force that

     the meteor applied to Earth during the impact.

     FIGURE 9.7 The Arizona Meteor Crater in Flagstaff, Arizona (often referred to as the Barringer Crater after the person who first suggested
     its origin and whose family owns the land). (credit: modification of work by "Shane.torgerson"/Wikimedia Commons)

     Strategy
     It is conceptually easier to reverse the question and calculate the force that Earth applied on the meteor in order to
     stop it. Therefore, we'll calculate the force on the meteor and then use Newton's third law to argue that the force
     from the meteor on Earth was equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
     Using the given data about the meteor, and making reasonable guesses about the shape of the meteor and impact
     time, we first calculate the impulse using Equation 9.6. We then use the relationship between force and impulse
     Equation 9.5 to estimate the average force during impact. Next, we choose a reasonable force function for the
     impact event, calculate the average value of that function Equation 9.4, and set the resulting expression equal to the
     calculated average force. This enables us to solve for the maximum force.

Solution

Define upward to be the +y-direction. For simplicity, assume the meteor is traveling vertically downward prior to

impact. In that case, its initial velocity is  , and the force Earth exerts on the meteor points upward,

          . The situation at  is depicted below.

The average force during the impact is related to the impulse by

From Equation 9.6,           , so we have

The mass is equal to the product of the meteor's density and its volume:
If we assume (guess) that the meteor was roughly spherical, we have
Thus we obtain

The problem says the velocity at impact was                       (the final velocity is zero); also, we guess that the

primary impact lasted about   . Substituting these values gives

This is the average force applied during the collision. Notice that this force vector points in the same direction as the
change of velocity vector .

Next, we calculate the maximum force. The impulse is related to the force function by
384  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     We need to make a reasonable choice for the force as a function of time. We define  to be the moment the

     meteor first touches the ground. Then we assume the force is a maximum at impact, and rapidly drops to zero. A

     function that does this is

     (The parameter represents how rapidly the force decreases to zero.) The average force is

     where                  . Since we already have a numeric value for , we can use the result of the integral to

     obtain    .

     Choosing               (this is a common choice, as you will see in later chapters), and guessing that  , this

     integral evaluates to

     Thus, the maximum force has a magnitude of

     The complete force function, including the direction, is

     This is the force Earth applied to the meteor; by Newton's third law, the force the meteor applied to Earth is

     which is the answer to the original question.
     Significance
     The graph of this function contains important information. Let's graph (the magnitude of) both this function and the
     average force together (Figure 9.8).

are equal to each other, and are numerically equal to the applied impulse.

Notice that the area under each plot has been filled in. For the plot of the (constant) force , the area is a

rectangle, corresponding to  . As for the plot of F(t), recall from calculus that the area under the plot of a

function is numerically equal to the integral of that function, over the specified interval; so here, that is

. Thus, the areas are equal, and both represent the impulse that the meteor applied to Earth

during the two-second impact. The average force on Earth sounds like a huge force, and it is. Nevertheless, Earth
barely noticed it. The acceleration Earth obtained was just

which is completely immeasurable. That said, the impact created seismic waves that nowadays could be detected
by modern monitoring equipment.

        EXAMPLE 9.2

The Benefits of Impulse

A car traveling at 27 m/s collides with a building. The collision with the building causes the car to come to a stop in
approximately 1 second. The driver, who weighs 860 N, is protected by a combination of a variable-tension seatbelt
and an airbag (Figure 9.9). (In effect, the driver collides with the seatbelt and airbag and not with the building.) The
airbag and seatbelt slow his velocity, such that he comes to a stop in approximately 2.5 s.

  a. What average force does the driver experience during the collision?
  b. Without the seatbelt and airbag, his collision time (with the steering wheel) would have been approximately

        0.20 s. What force would he experience in this case?

FIGURE 9.9 The motion of a car and its driver at the instant before and the instant after colliding with the wall. The restrained driver
experiences a large backward force from the seatbelt and airbag, which causes his velocity to decrease to zero. (The forward force from the
seatbelt is much smaller than the backward force, so we neglect it in the solution.)

Strategy
We are given the driver's weight, his initial and final velocities, and the time of collision; we are asked to calculate a
force. Impulse seems the right way to tackle this; we can combine Equation 9.5 and Equation 9.6.
Solution

  a. Define the +x-direction to be the direction the car is initially moving. We know

        and
386  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     Since J is equal to both those things, they must be equal to each other:
     We need to convert this weight to the equivalent mass, expressed in SI units:

     Remembering that                    , and noting that the final velocity is zero, we solve for the force:

          The negative sign implies that the force slows him down. For perspective, this is about 1.1 times his own
          weight.
     b. Same calculation, just the different time interval:

             which is about 14 times his own weight. Big difference!

     Significance
     You see that the value of an airbag is how greatly it reduces the force on the vehicle occupants. For this reason, they
     have been required on all passenger vehicles in the United States since 1991, and have been commonplace
     throughout Europe and Asia since the mid-1990s. The change of momentum in a crash is the same, with or without
     an airbag; the force, however, is vastly different.

     Effect of Impulse

     Since an impulse is a force acting for some amount of time, it causes an object's motion to change. Recall Equation
     9.6:

     Because is the momentum of a system,  is the change of momentum       . This gives us the following

     relation, called the impulse-momentum theorem (or relation).

     IMPULSE-MOMENTUM THEOREM

     An impulse applied to a system changes the system's momentum, and that change of momentum is exactly
     equal to the impulse that was applied:

                                                                                                                                                      9.7

     The impulse-momentum theorem is depicted graphically in Figure 9.10.

This impulse is added vectorially to the initial momentum. (c) Thus, the impulse equals the change in momentum,  . (d) After the
impulse, the ball moves off with its new momentum

There are two crucial concepts in the impulse-momentum theorem:

1. Impulse is a vector quantity; an impulse of, say,   is very different from an impulse of

; they cause completely opposite changes of momentum.

2. An impulse does not cause momentum; rather, it causes a change in the momentum of an object. Thus, you

must subtract the initial momentum from the final momentum, and--since momentum is also a vector

quantity--you must take careful account of the signs of the momentum vectors.

The most common questions asked in relation to impulse are to calculate the applied force, or the change of velocity
that occurs as a result of applying an impulse. The general approach is the same.

             EXAMPLE 9.3
     Moving the Enterprise

     FIGURE 9.11 The fictional starship Enterprise from the Star Trek adventures operated on so-called "impulse engines" that combined
     matter with antimatter to produce energy.

     When Captain Picard commands, "Take us out," the starship Enterprise (Figure 9.11) starts from rest to a final speed

     of                  . Assuming this maneuver is completed in 60 s, what average force did the impulse engines

     apply to the ship?

     Strategy

     We are asked for a force; we know the initial and final speeds (and hence the change in speed), and we know the

     time interval over which this all happened. In particular, we know the amount of time that the force acted. This

     suggests using the impulse-momentum relation. To use that, though, we need the mass of the Enterprise. An

     internet search gives a best estimate of the mass of the Enterprise (in the 2009 movie) as  .

     Solution
     Because this problem involves only one direction (i.e., the direction of the force applied by the engines), we only
     need the scalar form of the impulse-momentum theorem Equation 9.7, which is

     with

     and

Significance

Using Newton's Second Law, this force causes an acceleration of          . This is 130,000 times gravity,

which is unimaginably huge. It goes almost without saying that such a force would kill everyone on board instantly,

as well as destroying every piece of equipment. Fortunately, the Enterprise has "inertial dampeners." It is left as an

exercise for the reader's imagination to determine how these work.

   CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 9.1

The U.S. Air Force uses "10gs" (an acceleration equal to                 ) as the maximum acceleration a human can

withstand (but only for several seconds) and survive. How much time must the Enterprise spend accelerating if the

humans on board are to experience an average of at most 10gs of acceleration? (Assume the inertial dampeners are

offline.)

   EXAMPLE 9.4

The iPhone Drop

Apple released its iPhone 6 Plus in November 2014. According to many reports, it was originally supposed to have a
screen made from sapphire, but that was changed at the last minute for a hardened glass screen. Reportedly, this
was because the sapphire screen cracked when the phone was dropped. What force did the iPhone 6 Plus
experience as a result of being dropped?

Strategy

The force the phone experiences is due to the impulse applied to it by the floor when the phone collides with the
floor. Our strategy then is to use the impulse-momentum relationship. We calculate the impulse, estimate the
impact time, and use this to calculate the force.

We need to make a couple of reasonable estimates, as well as find technical data on the phone itself. First, let's
suppose that the phone is most often dropped from about chest height on an average-height person. Second,
assume that it is dropped from rest, that is, with an initial vertical velocity of zero. Finally, we assume that the phone
bounces very little--the height of its bounce is assumed to be negligible.

Solution

Define upward to be the +y-direction. A typical height is approximately  and, as stated,            . The

average force on the phone is related to the impulse the floor applies on it during the collision:

The impulse equals the change in momentum,
so

Next, the change of momentum is

We need to be careful with the velocities here; this is the change of velocity due to the collision with the floor. But

the phone also has an initial drop velocity [             ], so we label our velocities. Let:

·          the initial velocity with which the phone was dropped (zero, in this example)
390  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     ·         the velocity the phone had the instant just before it hit the floor

     ·         the final velocity of the phone as a result of hitting the floor

     Figure 9.12 shows the velocities at each of these points in the phone's trajectory.

     FIGURE 9.12 (a) The initial velocity of the phone is zero, just after the person drops it. (b) Just before the phone hits the floor, its velocity is

     which is unknown at the moment, except for its direction, which is downward  (c) After bouncing off the floor, the phone has a

     velocity , which is also unknown, except for its direction, which is upward

     With these definitions, the change of momentum of the phone during the collision with the floor is

     Since we assume the phone doesn't bounce at all when it hits the floor (or at least, the bounce height is negligible),
     then is zero, so

     We can get the speed of the phone just before it hits the floor using either kinematics or conservation of energy.
     We'll use conservation of energy here; you should re-do this part of the problem using kinematics and prove that you
     get the same answer.

     First, define the zero of potential energy to be located at the floor. Conservation of energy then gives us:

     Defining  and using                 gives

     Because is a vector magnitude, it must be positive. Thus,                            . Inserting this result into
     the expression for force gives

Finally, we need to estimate the collision time. One common way to estimate a collision time is to calculate how long
the object would take to travel its own length. The phone is moving at 5.4 m/s just before it hits the floor, and it is
0.14 m long, giving an estimated collision time of 0.026 s. Inserting the given numbers, we obtain

Significance                                           ; the force the floor applies to it is therefore over 20

The iPhone itself weighs just
times its weight.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 9.2

What if we had assumed the phone did bounce on impact? Would this have increased the force on the iPhone,
decreased it, or made no difference?

Momentum and Force

In Example 9.3, we obtained an important relationship:
                                                                                                                                                       9.8

In words, the average force applied to an object is equal to the change of the momentum that the force causes,
divided by the time interval over which this change of momentum occurs. This relationship is very useful in
situations where the collision time is small, but measureable; typical values would be 1/10th of a second, or
even one thousandth of a second. Car crashes, punting a football, or collisions of subatomic particles would meet
this criterion.

For a continuously changing momentum--due to a continuously changing force--this becomes a powerful

conceptual tool. In the limit  , Equation 9.2 becomes

                                                                                                     9.9

This says that the rate of change of the system's momentum (implying that momentum is a function of time) is
exactly equal to the net applied force (also, in general, a function of time). This is, in fact, Newton's second law,
written in terms of momentum rather than acceleration. This is the relationship Newton himself presented in his
Principia Mathematica (although he called it "quantity of motion" rather than "momentum").

If the mass of the system remains constant, Equation 9.3 reduces to the more familiar form of Newton's second law.
We can see this by substituting the definition of momentum:

The assumption of constant mass allowed us to pull m out of the derivative. If the mass is not constant, we cannot
392  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     use this form of the second law, but instead must start from Equation 9.3. Thus, one advantage to expressing force
     in terms of changing momentum is that it allows for the mass of the system to change, as well as the velocity; this is
     a concept we'll explore when we study the motion of rockets.

       NEWTON'S SECOND LAW OF MOTION IN TERMS OF MOMENTUM

       The net external force on a system is equal to the rate of change of the momentum of that system caused by the
       force:

     Although Equation 9.3 allows for changing mass, as we will see in Rocket Propulsion, the relationship between
     momentum and force remains useful when the mass of the system is constant, as in the following example.

             EXAMPLE 9.5

     Calculating Force: Venus Williams' Tennis Serve

     During the 2007 French Open, Venus Williams hit the fastest recorded serve in a premier women's match, reaching a
     speed of 58 m/s (209 km/h). What is the average force exerted on the 0.057-kg tennis ball by Venus Williams'
     racquet? Assume that the ball's speed just after impact is 58 m/s, as shown in Figure 9.13, that the initial horizontal
     component of the velocity before impact is negligible, and that the ball remained in contact with the racquet for 5.0
     ms.

                                      FIGURE 9.13 The final velocity of the tennis ball is  .

     Strategy
     This problem involves only one dimension because the ball starts from having no horizontal velocity component
     before impact. Newton's second law stated in terms of momentum is then written as

     As noted above, when mass is constant, the change in momentum is given by

where we have used scalars because this problem involves only one dimension. In this example, the velocity just

after impact and the time interval are given; thus, once is calculated, we can use          to find the force.

Solution
To determine the change in momentum, insert the values for the initial and final velocities into the equation above:

Now the magnitude of the net external force can be determined by using

where we have retained only two significant figures in the final step.

Significance

This quantity was the average force exerted by Venus Williams' racquet on the tennis ball during its brief impact

(note that the ball also experienced the 0.57-N force of gravity, but that force was not due to the racquet). This

problem could also be solved by first finding the acceleration and then using       , but one additional step would

be required compared with the strategy used in this example.

9.3 Conservation of Linear Momentum

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the meaning of "conservation of momentum"
    · Correctly identify if a system is, or is not, closed
    · Define a system whose momentum is conserved
    · Mathematically express conservation of momentum for a given system
    · Calculate an unknown quantity using conservation of momentum

Recall Newton's third law: When two objects of masses and interact (meaning that they apply forces on each
other), the force that object 2 applies to object 1 is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that
object 1 applies on object 2. Let:

·             the force on from

·             the force on from

Then, in symbols, Newton's third law says

                                                                                                                9.10

(Recall that these two forces do not cancel because they are applied to different objects.  causes to
accelerate, and causes to accelerate.)

Although the magnitudes of the forces on the objects are the same, the accelerations are not, simply because the
masses (in general) are different. Therefore, the changes in velocity of each object are different:

However, the products of the mass and the change of velocity are equal (in magnitude):
394  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

                                                                                                                 9.11

     It's a good idea, at this point, to make sure you're clear on the physical meaning of the derivatives in Equation 9.3.
     Because of the interaction, each object ends up getting its velocity changed, by an amount dv. Furthermore, the
     interaction occurs over a time interval dt, which means that the change of velocities also occurs over dt. This time
     interval is the same for each object.

     Let`s assume, for the moment, that the masses of the objects do not change during the interaction. (We'll relax this
     restriction later.) In that case, we can pull the masses inside the derivatives:

                                                                                                                                                          9.12

     and thus

                                                                                                                 9.13

     This says that the rate at which momentum changes is the same for both objects. The masses are different, and the
     changes of velocity are different, but the rate of change of the product of m and are the same.

     Physically, this means that during the interaction of the two objects (    ), both objects have their

     momentum changed; but those changes are identical in magnitude, though opposite in sign. For example, the

     momentum of object 1 might increase, which means that the momentum of object 2 decreases by exactly the same

     amount.

     In light of this, let's re-write Equation 9.12 in a more suggestive form:

                                                                                                                 9.14

     This says that during the interaction, although object 1's momentum changes, and object 2's momentum also
     changes, these two changes cancel each other out, so that the total change of momentum of the two objects
     together is zero.

     Since the total combined momentum of the two objects together never changes, then we could write

                                                                                                                 9.15

     from which it follows that

                                                                                                                 9.16

     As shown in Figure 9.14, the total momentum of the system before and after the collision remains the same.

FIGURE 9.14 Before the collision, the two billiard balls travel with momenta and . The total momentum of the system is the sum of

these, as shown by the red vector labeled  on the left. After the collision, the two billiard balls travel with different momenta and

. The total momentum, however, has not changed, as shown by the red vector arrow  on the right.

Generalizing this result to N objects, we obtain

                                                                                                 9.17

Equation 9.17 is the definition of the total (or net) momentum of a system of N interacting objects, along with the
statement that the total momentum of a system of objects is constant in time--or better, is conserved.

  CONSERVATION LAWS

  If the value of a physical quantity is constant in time, we say that the quantity is conserved.

Requirements for Momentum Conservation

There is a complication, however. A system must meet two requirements for its momentum to be conserved:
  1. The mass of the system must remain constant during the interaction.
       As the objects interact (apply forces on each other), they may transfer mass from one to another; but any
        mass one object gains is balanced by the loss of that mass from another. The total mass of the system of
        objects, therefore, remains unchanged as time passes:

  2. The net external force on the system must be zero.
        As the objects collide, or explode, and move around, they exert forces on each other. However, all of these
        forces are internal to the system, and thus each of these internal forces is balanced by another internal force
        that is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. As a result, the change in momentum caused by each internal
        force is cancelled by another momentum change that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
        Therefore, internal forces cannot change the total momentum of a system because the changes sum to zero.
        However, if there is some external force that acts on all of the objects (gravity, for example, or friction), then
        this force changes the momentum of the system as a whole; that is to say, the momentum of the system is
        changed by the external force. Thus, for the momentum of the system to be conserved, we must have
396  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     A system of objects that meets these two requirements is said to be a closed system (also called an isolated
     system). Thus, the more compact way to express this is shown below.

       LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM

       The total momentum of a closed system is conserved:

     This statement is called the Law of Conservation of Momentum. Along with the conservation of energy, it is one of
     the foundations upon which all of physics stands. All our experimental evidence supports this statement: from the
     motions of galactic clusters to the quarks that make up the proton and the neutron, and at every scale in between.
     In a closed system, the total momentum never changes.

     Note that there absolutely can be external forces acting on the system; but for the system's momentum to remain
     constant, these external forces have to cancel, so that the net external force is zero. Billiard balls on a table all have
     a weight force acting on them, but the weights are balanced (canceled) by the normal forces, so there is no net
     force.

     The Meaning of `System'

     A system (mechanical) is the collection of objects in whose motion (kinematics and dynamics) you are interested. If
     you are analyzing the bounce of a ball on the ground, you are probably only interested in the motion of the ball, and
     not of Earth; thus, the ball is your system. If you are analyzing a car crash, the two cars together compose your
     system (Figure 9.15).

     FIGURE 9.15 The two cars together form the system that is to be analyzed. It is important to remember that the contents (the mass) of the
     system do not change before, during, or after the objects in the system interact.

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
     Conservation of Momentum

     Using conservation of momentum requires four basic steps. The first step is crucial:

1. Identify a closed system (total mass is constant, no net external force acts on the system).
2. Write down an expression representing the total momentum of the system before the "event" (explosion or

     collision).
3. Write down an expression representing the total momentum of the system after the "event."
4. Set these two expressions equal to each other, and solve this equation for the desired quantity.

        EXAMPLE 9.6

Colliding Carts

Two carts in a physics lab roll on a level track, with negligible friction. These carts have small magnets at their ends,
so that when they collide, they stick together (Figure 9.16). The first cart has a mass of 675 grams and is rolling at
0.75 m/s to the right; the second has a mass of 500 grams and is rolling at 1.33 m/s, also to the right. After the
collision, what is the velocity of the two joined carts?

                                              FIGURE 9.16 Two lab carts collide and stick together after the collision.

Strategy
We have a collision. We're given masses and initial velocities; we're asked for the final velocity. This all suggests
using conservation of momentum as a method of solution. However, we can only use it if we have a closed system.
So we need to be sure that the system we choose has no net external force on it, and that its mass is not changed by
the collision.
Defining the system to be the two carts meets the requirements for a closed system: The combined mass of the two
carts certainly doesn't change, and while the carts definitely exert forces on each other, those forces are internal to
the system, so they do not change the momentum of the system as a whole. In the vertical direction, the weights of
the carts are canceled by the normal forces on the carts from the track.
Solution
Conservation of momentum is

Define the direction of their initial velocity vectors to be the +x-direction. The initial momentum is then

The final momentum of the now-linked carts is

     The principles that apply here to two laboratory carts apply identically to all objects of whatever type or size. Even
     for photons, the concepts of momentum and conservation of momentum are still crucially important even at that
     scale. (Since they are massless, the momentum of a photon is defined very differently from the momentum of
     ordinary objects. You will learn about this when you study quantum physics.)

clearly not a closed system; gravity applies a downward force on the ball while it is falling, and the normal force from
the floor applies a force during the bounce. Thus, we cannot use conservation of momentum as a strategy. Instead,
we simply determine the ball's momentum just before it collides with the floor and just after, and calculate the
difference. We have the ball's mass, so we need its velocities.

Solution

The ball's change of momentum is

Its velocity just before it hits the floor can be determined from either conservation of energy or kinematics. We

use kinematics here; you should re-solve it using conservation of energy and confirm you get the same result.

We want the velocity just before it hits the ground (at time ). We know its initial velocity  (at time ),

the height it falls, and its acceleration; we don't know the fall time. We could calculate that, but instead we use

Thus the ball has a momentum of

We don't have an easy way to calculate the momentum after the bounce. Instead, we reason from the
symmetry of the situation.
Before the bounce, the ball starts with zero velocity and falls 1.50 m under the influence of gravity, achieving
some amount of momentum just before it hits the ground. On the return trip (after the bounce), it starts with
some amount of momentum, rises the same 1.50 m it fell, and ends with zero velocity. Thus, the motion after
the bounce was the mirror image of the motion before the bounce. From this symmetry, it must be true that
the ball's momentum after the bounce must be equal and opposite to its momentum before the bounce. (This
is a subtle but crucial argument; make sure you understand it before you go on.)
Therefore,

Thus, the ball's change of momentum during the bounce is

b. What was Earth's change of momentum due to the ball colliding with the floor?
     Your instinctive response may well have been either "zero; the Earth is just too massive for that tiny ball to
     have affected it" or possibly, "more than zero, but utterly negligible." But no--if we re-define our system to be
     the Superball + Earth, then this system is closed (neglecting the gravitational pulls of the Sun, the Moon, and
     the other planets in the solar system), and therefore the total change of momentum of this new system must
     be zero. Therefore, Earth's change of momentum is exactly the same magnitude:

     This is where your instinctive feeling is probably correct:

     This change of Earth's velocity is utterly negligible.

     Significance

     It is important to realize that the answer to part (c) is not a velocity; it is a change of velocity, which is a very
     different thing. Nevertheless, to give you a feel for just how small that change of velocity is, suppose you were

     moving with a velocity of           . At this speed, it would take you about 7 million years to travel a

     distance equal to the diameter of a hydrogen atom.

     Ice Hockey 1

     Two hockey pucks of identical mass are on a flat, horizontal ice hockey rink. The red puck is motionless; the blue
     puck is moving at 2.5 m/s to the left (Figure 9.18). It collides with the motionless red puck. The pucks have a mass
     of 15 g. After the collision, the red puck is moving at 2.5 m/s, to the left. What is the final velocity of the blue puck?

     Strategy
     We're told that we have two colliding objects, we're told the masses and initial velocities, and one final velocity;
     we're asked for both final velocities. Conservation of momentum seems like a good strategy. Define the system to be

        EXAMPLE 9.9
Landing of Philae

On November 12, 2014, the European Space Agency successfully landed a probe named Philae on Comet 67P/
Churyumov/Gerasimenko (Figure 9.19). During the landing, however, the probe actually landed three times, because
it bounced twice. Let's calculate how much the comet's speed changed as a result of the first bounce.

FIGURE 9.19 An artist's rendering of Philae landing on a comet. (credit: modification of work by "DLR German Aerospace Center"/Flickr)
402  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     Let's define upward to be the +y-direction, perpendicular to the surface of the comet, and  to be at the surface
     of the comet. Here's what we know:

     · The mass of Comet 67P:
     · The acceleration due to the comet's gravity:
     · Philae's mass:
     · Initial touchdown speed:
     · Initial upward speed due to first bounce:
     · Landing impact time:

     Strategy

     We're asked for how much the comet's speed changed, but we don't know much about the comet, beyond its mass
     and the acceleration its gravity causes. However, we are told that the Philae lander collides with (lands on) the
     comet, and bounces off of it. A collision suggests momentum as a strategy for solving this problem.

     If we define a system that consists of both Philae and Comet 67/P, then there is no net external force on this system,
     and thus the momentum of this system is conserved. (We'll neglect the gravitational force of the sun.) Thus, if we
     calculate the change of momentum of the lander, we automatically have the change of momentum of the comet.
     Also, the comet's change of velocity is directly related to its change of momentum as a result of the lander
     "colliding" with it.

     Solution                                                               be its momentum just after the first

     Notice how important it is to include the negative sign of the initial momentum.
     Now for the comet. Since momentum of the system must be conserved, the comet's momentum changed by exactly
     the negative of this:

     Therefore, its change of velocity is

     This is a very small change in velocity, about a thousandth of a billionth of a meter per second. Crucially, however, it

9.4 Types of Collisions

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify the type of collision
    · Correctly label a collision as elastic or inelastic
    · Use kinetic energy along with momentum and impulse to analyze a collision

Although momentum is conserved in all interactions, not all interactions (collisions or explosions) are the same. The
possibilities include:

· A single object can explode into multiple objects (explosions).
· Multiple objects can collide and bounce off each other, called an elastic collision, resulting in the same kinetic

   energy of the system before and after the collision.
· Multiple objects can collide and the system loses kinetic energy, called an inelastic collision. One such case is

   where the two objects stick together, forming a single object.

It's useful, therefore, to categorize different types of interactions, according to how the interacting objects move
before and after the interaction.

Explosions

The first possibility is that a single object may break apart into two or more pieces. An example of this is a
firecracker, or a bow and arrow, or a rocket rising through the air toward space. These can be difficult to analyze if
the number of fragments after the collision is more than about three or four; but nevertheless, the total momentum
of the system before and after the explosion is identical.

Note that if the object is initially motionless, then the system (which is just the object) has no momentum and no
kinetic energy. After the explosion, the net momentum of all the pieces of the object must sum to zero (since the
momentum of this closed system cannot change). However, the system will have a great deal of kinetic energy after
the explosion, although it had none before. Thus, we see that, although the momentum of the system is conserved
in an explosion, the kinetic energy of the system most definitely is not; it increases. This interaction--one object
becoming many, with an increase of kinetic energy of the system--is called an explosion.

Where does the energy come from? Does conservation of energy still hold? Yes; some form of potential energy is
converted to kinetic energy. In the case of gunpowder burning and pushing out a bullet, chemical potential energy is
converted to kinetic energy of the bullet, and of the recoiling gun. For a bow and arrow, it is elastic potential energy
in the bowstring.

Inelastic

The second possibility is the reverse: that two or more objects collide with each other and stick together, thus (after
the collision) forming one single composite object. The total mass of this composite object is the sum of the masses
of the original objects, and the new single object moves with a velocity dictated by the conservation of momentum.
However, it turns out again that, although the total momentum of the system of objects remains constant, the kinetic
energy doesn't; but this time, the kinetic energy decreases. This type of collision is called inelastic.

Any collision where the objects stick together will result in the maximum loss of kinetic energy (i.e.,  will be a
minimum).

Such a collision is called perfectly inelastic. In the extreme case, multiple objects collide, stick together, and
remain motionless after the collision. Since the objects are all motionless after the collision, the final kinetic energy
is also zero; therefore, the loss of kinetic energy is a maximum.

· If        , the collision is inelastic.

· If is the lowest energy, or the energy lost by both objects is the most, the collision is perfectly inelastic

(objects stick together).

· If        , the collision is elastic.
404  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     Elastic

     The extreme case on the other end is if two or more objects approach each other, collide, and bounce off each other,
     moving away from each other at the same relative speed at which they approached each other. In this case, the total
     kinetic energy of the system is conserved. Such an interaction is called elastic.

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Collisions

     A closed system always conserves momentum; it might also conserve kinetic energy, but very often it doesn't.
     Energy-momentum problems confined to a plane (as ours are) usually have two unknowns. Generally, this approach
     works well:

       1. Define a closed system.
       2. Write down the expression for conservation of momentum.
       3. If kinetic energy is conserved, write down the expression for conservation of kinetic energy; if not, write down

             the expression for the change of kinetic energy.
       4. You now have two equations in two unknowns, which you solve by standard methods.

     EXAMPLE 9.10

     Formation of a Deuteron

     A proton (mass                      ) collides with a neutron (with essentially the same mass as the proton) to form a

     particle called a deuteron. What is the velocity of the deuteron if it is formed from a proton moving with velocity

                     to the right and a neutron moving with velocity  to the left?

     Strategy
     Define the system to be the two particles. This is a collision, so we should first identify what kind. Since we are told
     the two particles form a single particle after the collision, this means that the collision is perfectly inelastic. Thus,
     kinetic energy is not conserved, but momentum is. Thus, we use conservation of momentum to determine the final
     velocity of the system.

     Solution
     Treat the two particles as having identical masses M. Use the subscripts p, n, and d for proton, neutron, and
     deuteron, respectively. This is a one-dimensional problem, so we have

     The masses divide out:

     The velocity is thus                .

particles."

Ice Hockey 2

(This is a variation of an earlier example.)

Two ice hockey pucks of different masses are on a flat, horizontal hockey rink. The red puck has a mass of 15 grams,
and is motionless; the blue puck has a mass of 12 grams, and is moving at 2.5 m/s to the left. It collides with the
motionless red puck (Figure 9.20). If the collision is perfectly elastic, what are the final velocities of the two pucks?

FIGURE 9.20 Two different hockey pucks colliding. The top diagram shows the pucks the instant before the collision, and the bottom
diagram show the pucks the instant after the collision. The net external force is zero.

Strategy
We're told that we have two colliding objects, and we're told their masses and initial velocities; we're asked for both
final velocities. Conservation of momentum seems like a good strategy; define the system to be the two pucks.
There is no friction, so we have a closed system. We have two unknowns (the two final velocities), but only one
equation. The comment about the collision being perfectly elastic is the clue; it suggests that kinetic energy is also
conserved in this collision. That gives us our second equation.
The initial momentum and initial kinetic energy of the system resides entirely and only in the second puck (the blue
one); the collision transfers some of this momentum and energy to the first puck.
Solution
Conservation of momentum, in this case, reads

Conservation of kinetic energy reads

There are our two equations in two unknowns. The algebra is tedious but not terribly difficult; you definitely should
work it through. The solution is

Substituting with the given numbers where a positive direction is to the left, we obtain

     with it?

     EXAMPLE 9.12

     Thor vs. Iron Man

     The 2012 movie "The Avengers" has a scene where Iron Man and Thor fight. At the beginning of the fight, Thor
     throws his hammer at Iron Man, hitting him and throwing him slightly up into the air and against a small tree, which
     breaks. From the video, Iron Man is standing still when the hammer hits him. The distance between Thor and Iron
     Man is approximately 10 m, and the hammer takes about 1 s to reach Iron Man after Thor releases it. The tree is
     about 2 m behind Iron Man, which he hits in about 0.75 s. Also from the video, Iron Man's trajectory to the tree is
     very close to horizontal. Assuming Iron Man's total mass is 200 kg:

     a. Estimate the mass of Thor's hammer
     b. Estimate how much kinetic energy was lost in this collision

     Strategy

     After the collision, Thor's hammer is in contact with Iron Man for the entire time, so this is a perfectly inelastic
     collision. Thus, with the correct choice of a closed system, we expect momentum is conserved, but not kinetic
     energy. We use the given numbers to estimate the initial momentum, the initial kinetic energy, and the final kinetic
     energy. Because this is a one-dimensional problem, we can go directly to the scalar form of the equations.

     Solution

     a. First, we posit conservation of momentum. For that, we need a closed system. The choice here is the system

     (hammer + Iron Man), from the time of collision to the moment just before Iron Man and the hammer hit the

     tree. Let:

                 mass of the hammer

                 mass of Iron Man

                 velocity of the hammer before hitting Iron Man

      v combined velocity of Iron Man + hammer after the collision

     Again, Iron Man's initial velocity was zero. Conservation of momentum here reads:

     We are asked to find the mass of the hammer, so we have

     Considering the uncertainties in our estimates, this should be expressed with just one significant figure; thus,
                               .

b. The initial kinetic energy of the system, like the initial momentum, is all in the hammer:

After the collision,

Thus, there was a loss of  .

Significance

From other scenes in the movie, Thor apparently can control the hammer's velocity with his mind. It is possible,
therefore, that he mentally causes the hammer to maintain its initial velocity of 10 m/s while Iron Man is being
driven backward toward the tree. If so, this would represent an external force on our system, so it would not be
closed. Thor's mental control of his hammer is beyond the scope of this book, however.

        EXAMPLE 9.13

Analyzing a Car Crash

At a stoplight, a small car (1200 kg) collides with a motionless large truck (3000 kg). The car comes to an
instantaneous stop; the truck slides straight ahead, coming to a stop after sliding 10 meters. The measured
coefficient of friction between the truck's tires and the road was 0.62. How fast was the car moving at the moment
of impact?

Strategy
At first it may seem we don't have enough information to solve this problem. Although we know the initial speed of
the truck, we don't know the speed of the car (indeed, that's what we're asked to find), so we don't know the initial
momentum of the system. Similarly, we know the final speed of the car, but not the speed of the truck immediately
after impact. The fact that the truck eventually slid to a speed of zero doesn't help with the final momentum, since
an external friction force caused that. Nor can we calculate an impulse, since we don't know the collision time, or
the amount of time the truck slid before stopping. A useful strategy is to impose a restriction on the analysis.

Suppose we define a system consisting of just the car and the truck. The momentum of this system isn't conserved,
because of the friction between the truck and the road. But if we could find the speed of the truck the instant after
impact--before friction had any measurable effect on the truck--then we could consider the momentum of the
system to be conserved, with that restriction.

Can we find the final speed of the truck? Yes; we invoke the work-energy theorem.
408  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     Solution
     First, define some variables. Let:

     ·               be the masses of the car and truck, respectively

     ·               be the velocities of the truck before and after the collision, respectively

     ·               Z be the velocities of the car before and after the collision, respectively

     ·               be the kinetic energies of the truck immediately after the collision, and after the truck has stopped

        sliding (so  ).

     · d be the distance the truck slides after the collision before eventually coming to a stop.

     Since we actually want the initial speed of the car, and since the car is not part of the work-energy calculation, let's
     start with conservation of momentum. For the car + truck system, conservation of momentum reads

     Since the car's initial velocity was zero, as was the truck's final velocity, this simplifies to
     So now we need the truck's speed immediately after impact. Recall that
     where

     Also,
     The work is done over the distance the truck slides, which we've called d. Equating:

     Friction is the force on the truck that does the work to stop the sliding. With a level road, the friction force is

     Since the angle between the directions of the friction force vector and the displacement d is     , and
                            we have

     (Notice that the truck's mass divides out; evidently the mass of the truck doesn't matter.)
     Solving for the truck's speed immediately after the collision gives

This is an example of the type of analysis done by investigators of major car accidents. A great deal of legal and
financial consequences depend on an accurate analysis and calculation of momentum and energy.

truck and some heat and sound):

                           , which is obviously wrong. What is the mistake in this conclusion?

Subatomic Collisions and Momentum

Conservation of momentum is crucial to our understanding of atomic and subatomic particles because much of
what we know about these particles comes from collision experiments.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, there was considerable interest in, and debate about, the structure of the
atom. It was known that atoms contain two types of electrically charged particles: negatively charged electrons and
positively charged protons. (The existence of an electrically neutral particle was suspected, but would not be
confirmed until 1932.) The question was, how were these particles arranged in the atom? Were they distributed
uniformly throughout the volume of the atom (as J.J. Thomson proposed), or arranged at the corners of regular
polygons (which was Gilbert Lewis' model), or rings of negative charge that surround the positively charged
nucleus--rather like the planetary rings surrounding Saturn (as suggested by Hantaro Nagaoka), or something else?

The New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford (along with the German physicist Hans Geiger and the British physicist
Ernest Marsden) performed the crucial experiment in 1909. They bombarded a thin sheet of gold foil with a beam of
high-energy (that is, high-speed) alpha-particles (the nucleus of a helium atom). The alpha-particles collided with
the gold atoms, and their subsequent velocities were detected and analyzed, using conservation of momentum and
conservation of energy.

If the charges of the gold atoms were distributed uniformly (per Thomson), then the alpha-particles should collide
with them and nearly all would be deflected through many angles, all small; the Nagaoka model would produce a
similar result. If the atoms were arranged as regular polygons (Lewis), the alpha-particles would deflect at a
relatively small number of angles.

What actually happened is that nearly none of the alpha-particles were deflected. Those that were, were deflected
at large angles, some close to --those alpha-particles reversed direction completely (Figure 9.21). None of the
existing atomic models could explain this. Eventually, Rutherford developed a model of the atom that was much
closer to what we now have--again, using conservation of momentum and energy as his starting point.
410  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     FIGURE 9.21 The Thomson and Rutherford models of the atom. The Thomson model predicted that nearly all of the incident alpha-
     particles would be scattered and at small angles. Rutherford and Geiger found that nearly none of the alpha particles were scattered, but
     those few that were deflected did so through very large angles. The results of Rutherford's experiments were inconsistent with the
     Thomson model. Rutherford used conservation of momentum and energy to develop a new, and better model of the atom--the nuclear
     model.

     9.5 Collisions in Multiple Dimensions

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Express momentum as a two-dimensional vector
         · Write equations for momentum conservation in component form
         · Calculate momentum in two dimensions, as a vector quantity
     It is far more common for collisions to occur in two dimensions; that is, the angle between the initial velocity vectors
     is neither zero nor . Let's see what complications arise from this.
     The first idea we need is that momentum is a vector; like all vectors, it can be expressed as a sum of perpendicular
     components (usually, though not always, an x-component and a y-component, and a z-component if necessary).
     Thus, when we write down the statement of conservation of momentum for a problem, our momentum vectors can
     be, and usually will be, expressed in component form.
     The second idea we need comes from the fact that momentum is related to force:

     Expressing both the force and the momentum in component form,

Remember, these equations are simply Newton's second law, in vector form and in component form. We know that
Newton's second law is true in each direction, independently of the others. It follows therefore (via Newton's third
law) that conservation of momentum is also true in each direction independently.
These two ideas motivate the solution to two-dimensional problems: We write down the expression for conservation
of momentum twice: once in the x-direction and once in the y-direction.

                                                                                                                                                     9.18

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Conservation of Momentum in Two Dimensions

     The method for solving a two-dimensional (or even three-dimensional) conservation of momentum problem is
     generally the same as the method for solving a one-dimensional problem, except that you have to conserve
     momentum in both (or all three) dimensions simultaneously:

       1. Identify a closed system.
       2. Write down the equation that represents conservation of momentum in the x-direction, and solve it for the

            desired quantity. If you are calculating a vector quantity (velocity, usually), this will give you the x-component
             of the vector.
       3. Write down the equation that represents conservation of momentum in the y-direction, and solve. This will
            give you the y-component of your vector quantity.
       4. Assuming you are calculating a vector quantity, use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate its magnitude, using
             the results of steps 3 and 4.

FIGURE 9.23 A large truck moving north is about to collide with a small car moving east. The final momentum vector has both x- and
y-components.

Strategy
First off, we need a closed system. The natural system to choose is the (car + truck), but this system is not closed;
friction from the road acts on both vehicles. We avoid this problem by restricting the question to finding the velocity
at the instant just after the collision, so that friction has not yet had any effect on the system. With that restriction,
momentum is conserved for this system.
Since there are two directions involved, we do conservation of momentum twice: once in the x-direction and once in
the y-direction.
Solution
Before the collision the total momentum is

After the collision, the wreckage has momentum

Since the system is closed, momentum must be conserved, so we have

We have to be careful; the two initial momenta are not parallel. We must add vectorially (Figure 9.24).
414  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     FIGURE 9.24 Graphical addition of momentum vectors. Notice that, although the car's velocity is larger than the truck's, its momentum is
     smaller.

     If we define the +x-direction to point east and the +y-direction to point north, as in the figure, then (conveniently),

     Therefore, in the x-direction:

     and in the y-direction:

     Applying the Pythagorean theorem gives

     As for its direction, using the angle shown in the figure,

     This angle is east of north, or counterclockwise from the +x-direction.
     Significance
     As a practical matter, accident investigators usually work in the "opposite direction"; they measure the distance of
     skid marks on the road (which gives the stopping distance) and use the work-energy theorem along with
     conservation of momentum to determine the speeds and directions of the cars prior to the collision. We saw that
     analysis in an earlier section.

Exploding Scuba Tank

A common scuba tank is an aluminum cylinder that weighs 31.7 pounds empty (Figure 9.25). When full of
compressed air, the internal pressure is between 2500 and 3000 psi (pounds per square inch). Suppose such a tank,
which had been sitting motionless, suddenly explodes into three pieces. The first piece, weighing 10 pounds, shoots
off horizontally at 235 miles per hour; the second piece (7 pounds) shoots off at 172 miles per hour, also in the
horizontal plane, but at a angle to the first piece. What is the mass and initial velocity of the third piece? (Do all
work, and express your final answer, in SI units.)

                                                         FIGURE 9.25 A scuba tank explodes into three pieces.

Strategy
To use conservation of momentum, we need a closed system. If we define the system to be the scuba tank, this is
not a closed system, since gravity is an external force. However, the problem asks for just the initial velocity of the
third piece, so we can neglect the effect of gravity and consider the tank by itself as a closed system. Notice that, for
this system, the initial momentum vector is zero.
We choose a coordinate system where all the motion happens in the xy-plane. We then write down the equations for
conservation of momentum in each direction, thus obtaining the x- and y-components of the momentum of the third
piece, from which we obtain its magnitude (via the Pythagorean theorem) and its direction. Finally, dividing this
momentum by the mass of the third piece gives us the velocity.
Solution
First, let's get all the conversions to SI units out of the way:

9.6 Center of Mass

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the meaning and usefulness of the concept of center of mass
    · Calculate the center of mass of a given system
    · Apply the center of mass concept in two and three dimensions
    · Calculate the velocity and acceleration of the center of mass

We have been avoiding an important issue up to now: When we say that an object moves (more correctly,
accelerates) in a way that obeys Newton's second law, we have been ignoring the fact that all objects are actually
made of many constituent particles. A car has an engine, steering wheel, seats, passengers; a football is leather and
rubber surrounding air; a brick is made of atoms. There are many different types of particles, and they are generally
not distributed uniformly in the object. How do we include these facts into our calculations?

Then too, an extended object might change shape as it moves, such as a water balloon or a cat falling (Figure 9.26).
This implies that the constituent particles are applying internal forces on each other, in addition to the external force
that is acting on the object as a whole. We want to be able to handle this, as well.
418  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     FIGURE 9.26 As the cat falls, its body performs complicated motions so it can land on its feet, but one point in the system moves with the
     simple uniform acceleration of gravity.

     The problem before us, then, is to determine what part of an extended object is obeying Newton's second law when
     an external force is applied and to determine how the motion of the object as a whole is affected by both the internal
     and external forces.

     Be warned: To treat this new situation correctly, we must be rigorous and completely general. We won't make any
     assumptions about the nature of the object, or of its constituent particles, or either the internal or external forces.
     Thus, the arguments will be complex.

     Internal and External Forces

     Suppose we have an extended object of mass M, made of N interacting particles. Let's label their masses as ,

     where  . Note that

                                                                                                  9.19

     If we apply some net external force        on the object, every particle experiences some "share" or some fraction of
     that external force. Let:

     Notice that these fractions of the total force are not necessarily equal; indeed, they virtually never are. (They can be,
     but they usually aren't.) In general, therefore,

     Next, we assume that each of the particles making up our object can interact with (apply forces on) every other
     particle of the object. We won't try to guess what kind of forces they are; but since these forces are the result of

     particles of the object acting on other particles of the same object, we refer to them as internal forces ; thus:

            the net internal force that the jth particle experiences from all the other particles that make up the object.

     Now, the net force, internal plus external, on the jth particle is the vector sum of these:

                                                                                                  9.20

     where again, this is for all N particles;  .

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                   9.6 · Center of Mass                                                    419

As a result of this fractional force, the momentum of each particle gets changed:                                 9.21
The net force on the object is the vector sum of these forces:

                                                                                                                  9.22

This net force changes the momentum of the object as a whole, and the net change of momentum of the object
must be the vector sum of all the individual changes of momentum of all of the particles:

                                                                                                                                                     9.23

Combining Equation 9.22 and Equation 9.23 gives

                                                                                                                  9.24

Let's now think about these summations. First consider the internal forces term; remember that each is the

force on the jth particle from the other particles in the object. But by Newton's third law, for every one of these
forces, there must be another force that has the same magnitude, but the opposite sign (points in the opposite
direction). These forces do not cancel; however, that's not what we're doing in the summation. Rather, we're simply
mathematically adding up all the internal force vectors. That is, in general, the internal forces for any individual part
of the object won't cancel, but when all the internal forces are added up, the internal forces must cancel in pairs. It
follows, therefore, that the sum of all the internal forces must be zero:

(This argument is subtle, but crucial; take plenty of time to completely understand it.)
For the external forces, this summation is simply the total external force that was applied to the whole object:

As a result,

                                                                                                                  9.25

This is an important result. Equation 9.25 tells us that the total change of momentum of the entire object (all N
particles) is due only to the external forces; the internal forces do not change the momentum of the object as a
whole. This is why you can't lift yourself in the air by standing in a basket and pulling up on the handles: For the
system of you + basket, your upward pulling force is an internal force.
420  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     Force and Momentum

     Remember that our actual goal is to determine the equation of motion for the entire object (the entire system of
     particles). To that end, let's define:

               the total momentum of the system of N particles (the reason for the subscript will become clear shortly)
     Then we have

     and therefore Equation 9.25 can be written simply as

                                                                                                                   9.26

     Since this change of momentum is caused by only the net external force, we have dropped the "ext" subscript.

     This is Newton's second law, but now for the entire extended object. If this feels a bit anticlimactic, remember what

     is hiding inside it:   is the vector sum of the momentum of (in principle) hundreds of thousands of billions of

     billions of particles               , all caused by one simple net external force--a force that you can calculate.

     Center of Mass

     Our next task is to determine what part of the extended object, if any, is obeying Equation 9.26.

     It's tempting to take the next step; does the following equation mean anything?

                                                                                                                   9.27

     If it does mean something (acceleration of what, exactly?), then we could write

     and thus

     which follows because the derivative of a sum is equal to the sum of the derivatives.

     Now, is the momentum of the jth particle. Defining the positions of the constituent particles (relative to some

     coordinate system) as               , we thus have

     Substituting back, we obtain

     Dividing both sides by M (the total mass of the extended object) gives us

9.6 · Center of Mass                                                                                                                                       421

                                                                                                                                                     9.28

Thus, the point in the object that traces out the trajectory dictated by the applied force in Equation 9.27 is inside the
parentheses in Equation 9.28.
Looking at this calculation, notice that (inside the parentheses) we are calculating the product of each particle's
mass with its position, adding all N of these up, and dividing this sum by the total mass of particles we summed. This
is reminiscent of an average; inspired by this, we'll (loosely) interpret it to be the weighted average position of the
mass of the extended object. It's actually called the center of mass of the object. Notice that the position of the
center of mass has units of meters; that suggests a definition:

                                                                                                                                                     9.29

So, the point that obeys Equation 9.26 (and therefore Equation 9.27 as well) is the center of mass of the object,
which is located at the position vector .
It may surprise you to learn that there does not have to be any actual mass at the center of mass of an object. For
example, a hollow steel sphere with a vacuum inside it is spherically symmetrical (meaning its mass is uniformly
distributed about the center of the sphere); all of the sphere's mass is out on its surface, with no mass inside. But it
can be shown that the center of mass of the sphere is at its geometric center, which seems reasonable. Thus, there
is no mass at the position of the center of mass of the sphere. (Another example is a doughnut.) The procedure to
find the center of mass is illustrated in Figure 9.27.

     final vector is divided by the total mass. This vector points to the center of mass of the system. Note that no mass is actually present at the
     center of mass of this system.

     Since     , it follows that:

                                                                                             9.30

and this, like the position, has x-, y-, and z-components.
To calculate the center of mass in actual situations, we recommend the following procedure:

        PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Calculating the Center of Mass

The center of mass of an object is a position vector. Thus, to calculate it, do these steps:

  1. Define your coordinate system. Typically, the origin is placed at the location of one of the particles. This is not
        required, however.

  2. Determine the x, y, z-coordinates of each particle that makes up the object.
  3. Determine the mass of each particle, and sum them to obtain the total mass of the object. Note that the mass

       of the object at the origin must be included in the total mass.
  4. Calculate the x-, y-, and z-components of the center of mass vector, using Equation 9.30, Equation 9.31, and

        Equation 9.32.
  5. If required, use the Pythagorean theorem to determine its magnitude.

Here are two examples that will give you a feel for what the center of mass is.

We get the masses and separation distance of the Earth and moon, impose a coordinate system, and use Equation

9.29 with just    objects. We use a subscript "e" to refer to Earth, and subscript "m" to refer to the moon.

Solution
Define the origin of the coordinate system as the center of Earth. Then, with just two objects, Equation 9.29
becomes

the ions. We can then apply Equation 9.30, Equation 9.31, and Equation 9.32 (along with the Pythagorean theorem).
Solution
Define the origin to be at the location of the chloride ion at the bottom left of the unit cell. Figure 9.29 shows the
coordinate system.

     Similar calculations give                     (you could argue that this must be true, by symmetry,
     but it's a good idea to check).

     Significance

     Although this is a great exercise to determine the center of mass given a Chloride ion at the origin, in fact the origin
     could be chosen at any location. Therefore, there is no meaningful application of the center of mass of a unit cell
     beyond as an exercise.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 9.12

     Suppose you have a macroscopic salt crystal (that is, a crystal that is large enough to be visible with your unaided
     eye). It is made up of a huge number of unit cells. Is the center of mass of this crystal necessarily at the geometric
     center of the crystal?

Two crucial concepts come out of these examples:

1. As with all problems, you must define your coordinate system and origin. For center-of-mass calculations, it
     often makes sense to choose your origin to be located at one of the masses of your system. That choice
     automatically defines its distance in Equation 9.29 to be zero. However, you must still include the mass of the
     object at your origin in your calculation of M, the total mass Equation 9.19. In the Earth-moon system
     example, this means including the mass of Earth. If you hadn't, you'd have ended up with the center of mass
     of the system being at the center of the moon, which is clearly wrong.

2. In the second example (the salt crystal), notice that there is no mass at all at the location of the center of
     mass. This is an example of what we stated above, that there does not have to be any actual mass at the
     center of mass of an object.

Center of Mass of Continuous Objects

If the object in question has its mass distributed uniformly in space, rather than as a collection of discrete particles,

then  , and the summation becomes an integral:

                                                  9.34

In this context, r is a characteristic dimension of the object (the radius of a sphere, the length of a long rod). To
generate an integrand that can actually be calculated, you need to express the differential mass element dm as a
function of the mass density of the continuous object, and the dimension r. An example will clarify this.

        EXAMPLE 9.18

CM of a Uniform Thin Hoop

Find the center of mass of a uniform thin hoop (or ring) of mass M and radius r.

Strategy
First, the hoop's symmetry suggests the center of mass should be at its geometric center. If we define our
coordinate system such that the origin is located at the center of the hoop, the integral should evaluate to zero.

We replace dm with an expression involving the density of the hoop and the radius of the hoop. We then have an
expression we can actually integrate. Since the hoop is described as "thin," we treat it as a one-dimensional object,
neglecting the thickness of the hoop. Therefore, its density is expressed as the number of kilograms of material per
meter. Such a density is called a linear mass density, and is given the symbol ; this is the Greek letter "lambda,"
which is the equivalent of the English letter "l" (for "linear").

Since the hoop is described as uniform, this means that the linear mass density is constant. Thus, to get our
expression for the differential mass element dm, we multiply by a differential length of the hoop, substitute, and
integrate (with appropriate limits for the definite integral).

Solution
First, define our coordinate system and the relevant variables (Figure 9.30).
428  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     FIGURE 9.30 Finding the center of mass of a uniform hoop. We express the coordinates of a differential piece of the hoop, and then
     integrate around the hoop.

     The center of mass is calculated with Equation 9.34:

     We have to determine the limits of integration a and b. Expressing in component form gives us

     In the diagram, we highlighted a piece of the hoop that is of differential length ds; it therefore has a differential mass
                   . Substituting:

     However, the arc length ds subtends a differential angle , so we have
     and thus

     One more step: Since is the linear mass density, it is computed by dividing the total mass by the length of the
     hoop:

Notice that the variable of integration is now the angle . This tells us that the limits of integration (around the

circular hoop) are  , so                and             . Also, for convenience, we separate the integral into the x-

and y-components of . The final integral expression is

as expected.

Center of Mass and Conservation of Momentum

How does all this connect to conservation of momentum?

Suppose you have N objects with masses                  and initial velocities  . The center of
mass of the objects is                                                                          9.35

Its velocity is

and thus the initial momentum of the center of mass is

After these masses move and interact with each other, the momentum of the center of mass is

But conservation of momentum tells us that the right-hand side of both equations must be equal, which says
                                                                                                                                                     9.36

This result implies that conservation of momentum is expressed in terms of the center of mass of the system. Notice
that as an object moves through space with no net external force acting on it, an individual particle of the object may
accelerate in various directions, with various magnitudes, depending on the net internal force acting on that object
at any time. (Remember, it is only the vector sum of all the internal forces that vanishes, not the internal force on a
single particle.) Thus, such a particle's momentum will not be constant--but the momentum of the entire extended
object will be, in accord with Equation 9.36.
430  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     Equation 9.36 implies another important result: Since M represents the mass of the entire system of particles, it is
     necessarily constant. (If it isn't, we don't have a closed system, so we can't expect the system's momentum to be
     conserved.) As a result, Equation 9.36 implies that, for a closed system,

                                                                                                                                                          9.37

     That is to say, in the absence of an external force, the velocity of the center of mass never changes.
     You might be tempted to shrug and say, "Well yes, that's just Newton's first law," but remember that Newton's first
     law discusses the constant velocity of a particle, whereas Equation 9.37 applies to the center of mass of a (possibly
     vast) collection of interacting particles, and that there may not be any particle at the center of mass at all! So, this
     really is a remarkable result.

             EXAMPLE 9.19

     Fireworks Display

     When a fireworks rocket explodes, thousands of glowing fragments fly outward in all directions, and fall to Earth in
     an elegant and beautiful display (Figure 9.31). Describe what happens, in terms of conservation of momentum and
     center of mass.

            FIGURE 9.31 These exploding fireworks are a vivid example of conservation of momentum and the motion of the center of mass.

     The picture shows radial symmetry about the central points of the explosions; this suggests the idea of center of
     mass. We can also see the parabolic motion of the glowing particles; this brings to mind projectile motion ideas.
     Solution
     Initially, the fireworks rocket is launched and flies more or less straight upward; this is the cause of the more-or-
     less-straight, white trail going high into the sky below the explosion in the upper-right of the picture (the yellow
     explosion). This trail is not parabolic because the explosive shell, during its launch phase, is actually a rocket; the
     impulse applied to it by the ejection of the burning fuel applies a force on the shell during the rise-time interval.
     (This is a phenomenon we will study in the next section.) The shell has multiple forces on it; thus, it is not in free-fall
     prior to the explosion.
     At the instant of the explosion, the thousands of glowing fragments fly outward in a radially symmetrical pattern.

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                        9.6 · Center of Mass                431

The symmetry of the explosion is the result of all the internal forces summing to zero  for every

internal force, there is another that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

However, as we learned above, these internal forces cannot change the momentum of the center of mass of the
(now exploded) shell. Since the rocket force has now vanished, the center of mass of the shell is now a projectile
(the only force on it is gravity), so its trajectory does become parabolic. The two red explosions on the left show the
path of their centers of mass at a slightly longer time after explosion compared to the yellow explosion on the upper
right.

In fact, if you look carefully at all three explosions, you can see that the glowing trails are not truly radially
symmetric; rather, they are somewhat denser on one side than the other. Specifically, the yellow explosion and the
lower middle explosion are slightly denser on their right sides, and the upper-left explosion is denser on its left side.
This is because of the momentum of their centers of mass; the differing trail densities are due to the momentum
each piece of the shell had at the moment of its explosion. The fragment for the explosion on the upper left of the
picture had a momentum that pointed upward and to the left; the middle fragment's momentum pointed upward
and slightly to the right; and the right-side explosion clearly upward and to the right (as evidenced by the white
rocket exhaust trail visible below the yellow explosion).

Finally, each fragment is a projectile on its own, thus tracing out thousands of glowing parabolas.

Significance
In the discussion above, we said, "...the center of mass of the shell is now a projectile (the only force on it is
gravity)...." This is not quite accurate, for there may not be any mass at all at the center of mass; in which case, there
could not be a force acting on it. This is actually just verbal shorthand for describing the fact that the gravitational
forces on all the particles act so that the center of mass changes position exactly as if all the mass of the shell were
always located at the position of the center of mass.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 9.13

How would the firework display change in deep space, far away from any source of gravity?

You may sometimes hear someone describe an explosion by saying something like, "the fragments of the exploded
object always move in a way that makes sure that the center of mass continues to move on its original trajectory."
This makes it sound as if the process is somewhat magical: how can it be that, in every explosion, it always works
out that the fragments move in just the right way so that the center of mass' motion is unchanged? Phrased this way,
it would be hard to believe no explosion ever does anything differently.

The explanation of this apparently astonishing coincidence is: We defined the center of mass precisely so this is
exactly what we would get. Recall that first we defined the momentum of the system:

We then concluded that the net external force on the system (if any) changed this momentum:

and then--and here's the point--we defined an acceleration that would obey Newton's second law. That is, we
demanded that we should be able to write

which requires that

     where the quantity inside the parentheses is the center of mass of our system. So, it's not astonishing that the
     center of mass obeys Newton's second law; we defined it so that it would.

     9.7 Rocket Propulsion

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the application of conservation of momentum when the mass changes with time, as well as the
             velocity

         · Calculate the speed of a rocket in empty space, at some time, given initial conditions
         · Calculate the speed of a rocket in Earth's gravity field, at some time, given initial conditions

     Now we deal with the case where the mass of an object is changing. We analyze the motion of a rocket, which
     changes its velocity (and hence its momentum) by ejecting burned fuel gases, thus causing it to accelerate in the
     opposite direction of the velocity of the ejected fuel (see Figure 9.32). Specifically: A fully fueled rocket ship in deep
     space has a total mass (this mass includes the initial mass of the fuel). At some moment in time, the rocket has a
     velocity and mass m; this mass is a combination of the mass of the empty rocket and the mass of the remaining
     unburned fuel it contains. (We refer to m as the "instantaneous mass" and as the "instantaneous velocity.") The
     rocket accelerates by burning the fuel it carries and ejecting the burned exhaust gases. If the burn rate of the fuel is
     constant, and the velocity at which the exhaust is ejected is also constant, what is the change of velocity of the
     rocket as a result of burning all of its fuel?

     FIGURE 9.32 The space shuttle had a number of reusable parts. Solid fuel boosters on either side were recovered and refueled after each
     flight, and the entire orbiter returned to Earth for use in subsequent flights. The large liquid fuel tank was expended. The space shuttle was
     a complex assemblage of technologies, employing both solid and liquid fuel, and pioneering ceramic tiles as reentry heat shields. As a
     result, it permitted multiple launches as opposed to single-use rockets. (credit: modification of work by NASA)

     Physical Analysis

     Here's a description of what happens, so that you get a feel for the physics involved.

    · As the rocket engines operate, they are continuously ejecting burned fuel gases, which have both mass and
        velocity, and therefore some momentum. By conservation of momentum, the rocket's momentum changes by
        this same amount (with the opposite sign). We will assume the burned fuel is being ejected at a constant rate,
        which means the rate of change of the rocket's momentum is also constant. By Equation 9.9, this represents a
        constant force on the rocket.

    · However, as time goes on, the mass of the rocket (which includes the mass of the remaining fuel) continuously
        decreases. Thus, even though the force on the rocket is constant, the resulting acceleration is not; it is
        continuously increasing.

    · So, the total change of the rocket's velocity will depend on the amount of mass of fuel that is burned, and that
        dependence is not linear.

The problem has the mass and velocity of the rocket changing; also, the total mass of ejected gases is changing. If
we define our system to be the rocket + fuel, then this is a closed system (since the rocket is in deep space, there
are no external forces acting on this system); as a result, momentum is conserved for this system. Thus, we can
apply conservation of momentum to answer the question (Figure 9.33).

FIGURE 9.33 The rocket accelerates to the right due to the expulsion of some of its fuel mass to the left. Conservation of momentum
enables us to determine the resulting change of velocity. The mass m is the instantaneous total mass of the rocket (i.e., mass of rocket body
plus mass of fuel at that point in time). (credit: modification of work by NASA/Bill Ingalls)

At the same moment that the total instantaneous rocket mass is m (i.e., m is the mass of the rocket body plus the

mass of the fuel at that point in time), we define the rocket's instantaneous velocity to be  (in the

+x-direction); this velocity is measured relative to an inertial reference system (the Earth, for example). Thus, the

initial momentum of the system is

The rocket's engines are burning fuel at a constant rate and ejecting the exhaust gases in the -x-direction. During an

infinitesimal time interval dt, the engines eject a (positive) infinitesimal mass of gas at velocity         ; note

that although the rocket velocity is measured with respect to Earth, the exhaust gas velocity is measured with

respect to the (moving) rocket. Measured with respect to the Earth, therefore, the exhaust gas has velocity            .

As a consequence of the ejection of the fuel gas, the rocket's mass decreases by , and its velocity increases by
    . Therefore, including both the change for the rocket and the change for the exhaust gas, the final momentum of

the system is

Since all vectors are in the x-direction, we drop the vector notation. Applying conservation of momentum, we obtain

     Now, and dv are each very small; thus, their product  is very, very small, much smaller than the other

     two terms in this expression. We neglect this term, therefore, and obtain:

     Our next step is to remember that, since represents an increase in the mass of ejected gases, it must also
     represent a decrease of mass of the rocket:

     Replacing this, we have
     or

     Integrating from the initial mass m0 to the final mass m of the rocket gives us the result we are after:

     and thus our final answer is

                                                                                                               9.38

     This result is called the rocket equation. It was originally derived by the Russian rocket scientist Konstantin
     Tsiolkovsky in 1897. It gives us the change of velocity that the rocket obtains from burning a mass of fuel that
     decreases the total rocket mass from down to m. As expected, the relationship between and the change of
     mass of the rocket is nonlinear.

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Rocket Propulsion

     In rocket problems, the most common questions are finding the change of velocity due to burning some amount of
     fuel for some amount of time; or to determine the acceleration that results from burning fuel.

       1. To determine the change of velocity, use the rocket equation Equation 9.38.
       2. To determine the acceleration, determine the force by using the impulse-momentum theorem, using the

             rocket equation to determine the change of velocity.

thrusters are on for 30 s.

  a. What is the thrust (the force applied to the rocket by the ejected fuel) on the spacecraft?
  b. What is the spacecraft's acceleration as a function of time?
  c. What are the spacecraft's accelerations at t = 0, 15, 30, and 35 s?

Strategy

  a. The force on the spacecraft is equal to the rate of change of the momentum of the fuel.
  b. Knowing the force from part (a), we can use Newton's second law to calculate the consequent acceleration.

        The key here is that, although the force applied to the spacecraft is constant (the fuel is being ejected at a
        constant rate), the mass of the spacecraft isn't; thus, the acceleration caused by the force won't be constant.
       We expect to get a function a(t), therefore.
   c. We'll use the function we obtain in part (b), and just substitute the numbers given. Important: We expect that
        the acceleration will get larger as time goes on, since the mass being accelerated is continuously decreasing
        (fuel is being ejected from the rocket).

Solution

  a. The momentum of the ejected fuel gas is

The ejection velocity     is constant, and therefore the force is

Now,        is the rate of change of the mass of the fuel; the problem states that this is         .

Substituting, we get

b. Above, we defined m to be the combined mass of the empty rocket plus however much unburned fuel it

contained:             . From Newton's second law,

The force is constant and the empty rocket mass  is constant, but the fuel mass is decreasing at a
uniform rate; specifically:

This gives us

Notice that, as expected, the acceleration is a function of time. Substituting the given numbers:

c. At  :

At                     .
436  9 · Linear Momentum and Collisions

     At                                  .

     Acceleration is increasing, as we expected.

     At  (and at any time after              ), the acceleration is          since the thrusters stopped working and

     thus no external forces are acting on the spacecraft.

     Significance
     Notice that the acceleration is not constant; as a result, any dynamical quantities must be calculated either using
     integrals, or (more easily) conservation of total energy.

     What is the physical difference (or relationship) between and

     Rocket in a Gravitational Field

     Let's now analyze the velocity change of the rocket during the launch phase, from the surface of Earth. To keep the
     math manageable, we'll restrict our attention to distances for which the acceleration caused by gravity can be
     treated as a constant g.

     The analysis is similar, except that now there is an external force of  acting on our system. This force

     applies an impulse                      , which is equal to the change of momentum. This gives us

     and so                                  and dropped the vector notation. Next we replace with :
     where we have again neglected the term

     Dividing through by m gives

     and integrating, we have

                                                                                                        9.39

     Unsurprisingly, the rocket's velocity is affected by the (constant) acceleration of gravity.

     Remember that is the burn time of the fuel. Now, in the absence of gravity, Equation 9.38 implies that it makes
     no difference how much time it takes to burn the entire mass of fuel; the change of velocity does not depend on .
     However, in the presence of gravity, it matters a lot. The -g term in Equation 9.39 tells us that the longer the burn
     time is, the smaller the rocket's change of velocity will be. This is the reason that the launch of a rocket is so
     spectacular at the first moment of liftoff: It's essential to burn the fuel as quickly as possible, to get as large a as
     possible.

INTRODUCTION In previous chapters, we described motion (kinematics) and how to change motion (dynamics),
and we defined important concepts such as energy for objects that can be considered as point masses. Point
masses, by definition, have no shape and so can only undergo translational motion. However, we know from
everyday life that rotational motion is also very important and that many objects that move have both translation
and rotation. The wind turbines in our chapter opening image are a prime example of how rotational motion impacts
our daily lives, as the market for clean energy sources continues to grow.
We begin to address rotational motion in this chapter, starting with fixed-axis rotation. Fixed-axis rotation describes
the rotation around a fixed axis of a rigid body; that is, an object that does not deform as it moves. We will show how
to apply all the ideas we've developed up to this point about translational motion to an object rotating around a fixed
axis. In the next chapter, we extend these ideas to more complex rotational motion, including objects that both
rotate and translate, and objects that do not have a fixed rotational axis.

     10.1 Rotational Variables

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the physical meaning of rotational variables as applied to fixed-axis rotation
         · Explain how angular velocity is related to tangential speed
         · Calculate the instantaneous angular velocity given the angular position function
         · Find the angular velocity and angular acceleration in a rotating system
         · Calculate the average angular acceleration when the angular velocity is changing
         · Calculate the instantaneous angular acceleration given the angular velocity function

     So far in this text, we have mainly studied translational motion, including the variables that describe it:
     displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Now we expand our description of motion to rotation--specifically,
     rotational motion about a fixed axis. We will find that rotational motion is described by a set of related variables
     similar to those we used in translational motion.

     Angular Velocity

     Uniform circular motion (discussed previously in Motion in Two and Three Dimensions) is motion in a circle at
     constant speed. Although this is the simplest case of rotational motion, it is very useful for many situations, and we
     use it here to introduce rotational variables.

     In Figure 10.2, we show a particle moving in a circle. The coordinate system is fixed and serves as a frame of
     reference to define the particle's position. Its position vector from the origin of the circle to the particle sweeps out
     the angle , which increases in the counterclockwise direction as the particle moves along its circular path. The
     angle is called the angular position of the particle. As the particle moves in its circular path, it also traces an arc
     length s. The particle may complete more than one revolution around the circle, and so the angle may be greater
     than , and the arc length s may be greater than the circumference, .

     FIGURE 10.2 A particle follows a circular path. As it moves counterclockwise, it sweeps out a positive angle with respect to the x-axis and
     traces out an arc length s.

     The angle is related to the radius of the circle and the arc length by
                                                                                                                                                          10.1

     The angle , the angular position of the particle along its path, has units of radians (rad). There are radians in
             Note that the radian measure is a ratio of length measurements, and therefore is a dimensionless quantity. As

     the particle moves along its circular path, its angular position changes and it undergoes angular displacements
     We can assign vectors to the quantities in Equation 10.1. The angle is a vector out of the page in Figure 10.2. The
     angular position vector and the arc length both lie in the plane of the page. These three vectors are related to

That is, the arc length is the cross product of the angle vector and the position vector, as shown in Figure 10.3.

FIGURE 10.3 The angle vector points along the z-axis and the position vector and arc length vector both lie in the xy-plane. We see that
              . All three vectors are perpendicular to each other.

The magnitude of the angular velocity, denoted by , is the time rate of change of the angle  as the particle moves
                                                                                              in the average

                                                                                                                    10.3

where is the angle of rotation (Figure 10.2). The units of angular velocity are radians per second (rad/s). Angular
velocity can also be referred to as the rotation rate in radians per second. In many situations, we are given the
rotation rate in revolutions/s or cycles/s. To find the angular velocity, we must multiply revolutions/s by , since
there are radians in one complete revolution. Since the direction of a positive angle in a circle is
counterclockwise, we take counterclockwise rotations as being positive and clockwise rotations as negative.

We can see how angular velocity is related to the tangential speed of the particle by differentiating Equation 10.1
with respect to time. We rewrite Equation 10.1 as

Taking the derivative with respect to time and noting that the radius r is a constant, we have

where          . Here     is just the tangential speed of the particle in Figure 10.2. Thus, by using Equation 10.3,
we arrive at                                                                                                                                10.4

That is, the tangential speed of the particle is its angular velocity times the radius of the circle. From Equation 10.4,

we see that the tangential speed of the particle increases with its distance from the axis of rotation for a constant

angular velocity. This effect is shown in Figure 10.4. Two particles are placed at different radii on a rotating disk with

a constant angular velocity. As the disk rotates, the tangential speed increases linearly with the radius from the axis

of rotation. In Figure 10.4, we see that  and            . But the disk has a constant angular velocity, so

. This means              or              . Thus, since  ,  .

     FIGURE 10.4 Two particles on a rotating disk have different tangential speeds, depending on their distance to the axis of rotation.

     Up until now, we have discussed the magnitude of the angular velocity  which is a scalar quantity--the

     change in angular position with respect to time. The vector is the vector associated with the angular velocity and

     points along the axis of rotation. This is useful because when a rigid body is rotating, we want to know both the axis

     of rotation and the direction that the body is rotating about the axis, clockwise or counterclockwise. The angular

     velocity gives us this information. The angular velocity has a direction determined by what is called the right-

     hand rule. The right-hand rule is such that if the fingers of your right hand wrap counterclockwise from the x-axis

     (the direction in which increases) toward the y-axis, your thumb points in the direction of the positive z-axis

     (Figure 10.5). An angular velocity that points along the positive z-axis therefore corresponds to a

     counterclockwise rotation, whereas an angular velocity that points along the negative z-axis corresponds to a

     clockwise rotation.

     FIGURE 10.5 For counterclockwise rotation in the coordinate system shown, the angular velocity points in the positive z-direction by the
     right-hand-rule.

     Similar to Equation 10.2, one can state a cross product relation to the vector of the tangential velocity as stated in
     Equation 10.4. Therefore, we have

That is, the tangential velocity is the cross product of the angular velocity and the position vector, as shown in Figure
10.6. From part (a) of this figure, we see that with the angular velocity in the positive z-direction, the rotation in the
xy-plane is counterclockwise. In part (b), the angular velocity is in the negative z-direction, giving a clockwise
rotation in the xy-plane.

FIGURE 10.6 The vectors shown are the angular velocity, position, and tangential velocity. (a) The angular velocity points in the positive

    EXAMPLE 10.1

Rotation of a Flywheel

A flywheel rotates such that it sweeps out an angle at the rate of                      radians. The wheel rotates

counterclockwise when viewed in the plane of the page. (a) What is the angular velocity of the flywheel? (b) What

direction is the angular velocity? (c) How many radians does the flywheel rotate through in 30 s? (d) What is the

tangential speed of a point on the flywheel 10 cm from the axis of rotation?

Strategy

The functional form of the angular position of the flywheel is given in the problem as  , so by taking the

derivative with respect to time, we can find the angular velocity. We use the right-hand rule to find the angular

velocity. To find the angular displacement of the flywheel during 30 s, we seek the angular displacement , where

the change in angular position is between 0 and 30 s. To find the tangential speed of a point at a distance from the

axis of rotation, we multiply its distance times the angular velocity of the flywheel.

Solution

a.        . We see that the angular velocity is a constant.

b. By the right-hand rule, we curl the fingers in the direction of rotation, which is counterclockwise in the plane of

    the page, and the thumb points in the direction of the angular velocity, which is out of the page.

c.                                                                  .

d.                      .

Significance

In 30 s, the flywheel has rotated through quite a number of revolutions, about 215 if we divide the angular
displacement by . A massive flywheel can be used to store energy in this way, if the losses due to friction are
minimal. Recent research has considered superconducting bearings on which the flywheel rests, with zero energy
loss due to friction.

Angular Acceleration

We have just discussed angular velocity for uniform circular motion, but not all motion is uniform. Envision an ice
skater spinning with his arms outstretched--when he pulls his arms inward, his angular velocity increases. Or think
about a computer's hard disk slowing to a halt as the angular velocity decreases. We will explore these situations
454  10 · Fixed-Axis Rotation

     later, but we can already see a need to define an angular acceleration for describing situations where changes.
     The faster the change in , the greater the angular acceleration. We define the instantaneous angular acceleration

       as the derivative of angular velocity with respect to time:

                                                                                                                                                          10.6

     where we have taken the limit of the average angular acceleration,     as  .

     The units of angular acceleration are (rad/s)/s, or  .

     In the same way as we defined the vector associated with angular velocity , we can define , the vector associated
     with angular acceleration (Figure 10.7). If the angular velocity is along the positive z-axis, as in Figure 10.5, and
     is positive, then the angular acceleration is positive and points along the axis. Similarly, if the angular velocity

        is along the positive z-axis and is negative, then the angular acceleration is negative and points along the
     axis.

     FIGURE 10.7 The rotation is counterclockwise in both (a) and (b) with the angular velocity in the same direction. (a) The angular
     acceleration is in the same direction as the angular velocity, which increases the rotation rate. (b) The angular acceleration is in the
     opposite direction to the angular velocity, which decreases the rotation rate.

     We can express the tangential acceleration vector as a cross product of the angular acceleration and the position

     vector. This expression can be found by taking the time derivative of      and is left as an exercise:

                                                                                                                                               10.7

     The vector relationships for the angular acceleration and tangential acceleration are shown in Figure 10.8.

     We can relate the tangential acceleration of a point on a rotating body at a distance from the axis of rotation in the
     same way that we related the tangential speed to the angular velocity. If we differentiate Equation 10.4 with respect
     to time, noting that the radius r is constant, we obtain

Thus, the tangential acceleration is the radius times the angular acceleration. Equation 10.4 and Equation 10.8
are important for the discussion of rolling motion (see Angular Momentum).
Let's apply these ideas to the analysis of a few simple fixed-axis rotation scenarios. Before doing so, we present a
problem-solving strategy that can be applied to rotational kinematics: the description of rotational motion.

        PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Rotational Kinematics

  1. Examine the situation to determine that rotational kinematics (rotational motion) is involved.
  2. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A sketch of the situation

        is useful.
  3. Make a complete list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).
  4. Solve the appropriate equation or equations for the quantity to be determined (the unknown). It can be useful

        to think in terms of a translational analog, because by now you are familiar with the equations of translational
        motion.
  5. Substitute the known values along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical
        solutions complete with units. Be sure to use units of radians for angles.
  6. Check your answer to see if it is reasonable: Does your answer make sense?

Now let's apply this problem-solving strategy to a few specific examples.

EXAMPLE 10.2

A Spinning Bicycle Wheel

A bicycle mechanic mounts a bicycle on the repair stand and starts the rear wheel spinning from rest to a final

angular velocity of 250 rpm in 5.00 s. (a) Calculate the average angular acceleration in  . (b) If she now hits the

brakes, causing an angular acceleration of -87.3  , how long does it take the wheel to stop?

Strategy

The average angular acceleration can be found directly from its definition  because the final angular velocity

and time are given. We see that                          and is 5.00 s. For part (b), we know the

angular acceleration and the initial angular velocity. We can find the stopping time by using the definition of average

angular acceleration and solving for , yielding

Solution
  a. Entering known information into the definition of angular acceleration, we get

Because is in revolutions per minute (rpm) and we want the standard units of              for angular
acceleration, we need to convert from rpm to rad/s:

Entering this quantity into the expression for , we get
456  10 · Fixed-Axis Rotation

     b. Here the angular velocity decreases from 26.2 rad/s (250 rpm) to zero, so that  is -26.2 rad/s, and is

     given to be -87.3         . Thus,

     Significance
     Note that the angular acceleration as the mechanic spins the wheel is small and positive; it takes 5 s to produce an
     appreciable angular velocity. When she hits the brake, the angular acceleration is large and negative. The angular
     velocity quickly goes to zero.

Strategy

a. We are given the rotational sense of the turbine, which is counterclockwise in the plane of the page. Using the
     right hand rule (Figure 10.5), we can establish the directions of the angular velocity and acceleration vectors.

b. We calculate the initial and final angular velocities to get the average angular acceleration. We establish the
     sign of the angular acceleration from the results in (a).

c. We are given the functional form of the angular velocity, so we can find the functional form of the angular
     acceleration function by taking its derivative with respect to time.

Solution

a. Since the turbine is rotating counterclockwise, angular velocity points out of the page. But since the angular

velocity is decreasing, the angular acceleration points into the page, in the opposite sense to the angular

velocity.

b. The initial angular velocity of the turbine, setting  . The final angular velocity is zero, so

the average angular acceleration is

   c. Taking the derivative of the angular velocity with respect to time gives

Significance
We found from the calculations in (a) and (b) that the angular acceleration and the average angular acceleration
are negative. The turbine has an angular acceleration in the opposite sense to its angular velocity.

We now have a basic vocabulary for discussing fixed-axis rotational kinematics and relationships between rotational
variables. We discuss more definitions and connections in the next section.

     10.2 Rotation with Constant Angular Acceleration

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Derive the kinematic equations for rotational motion with constant angular acceleration
         · Select from the kinematic equations for rotational motion with constant angular acceleration the

             appropriate equations to solve for unknowns in the analysis of systems undergoing fixed-axis rotation
         · Use solutions found with the kinematic equations to verify the graphical analysis of fixed-axis rotation

             with constant angular acceleration

     In the preceding section, we defined the rotational variables of angular displacement, angular velocity, and angular
     acceleration. In this section, we work with these definitions to derive relationships among these variables and use
     these relationships to analyze rotational motion for a rigid body about a fixed axis under a constant angular
     acceleration. This analysis forms the basis for rotational kinematics. If the angular acceleration is constant, the
     equations of rotational kinematics simplify, similar to the equations of linear kinematics discussed in Motion along a
     Straight Line and Motion in Two and Three Dimensions. We can then use this simplified set of equations to describe
     many applications in physics and engineering where the angular acceleration of the system is constant. Rotational
     kinematics is also a prerequisite to the discussion of rotational dynamics later in this chapter.

     Kinematics of Rotational Motion

     Using our intuition, we can begin to see how the rotational quantities  , and t are related to one another. For

     example, we saw in the preceding section that if a flywheel has an angular acceleration in the same direction as its

     angular velocity vector, its angular velocity increases with time and its angular displacement also increases. On the

     contrary, if the angular acceleration is opposite to the angular velocity vector, its angular velocity decreases with

     time. We can describe these physical situations and many others with a consistent set of rotational kinematic

     equations under a constant angular acceleration. The method to investigate rotational motion in this way is called

     kinematics of rotational motion.

     To begin, we note that if the system is rotating under a constant acceleration, then the average angular velocity
     follows a simple relation because the angular velocity is increasing linearly with time. The average angular velocity is
     just half the sum of the initial and final values:

                                                                                                                       10.9

     From the definition of the average angular velocity, we can find an equation that relates the angular position,
     average angular velocity, and time:

     Solving for , we have

                                                                                                                      10.10

     where we have set         . This equation can be very useful if we know the average angular velocity of the system.

     Then we could find the angular displacement over a given time period. Next, we find an equation relating , , and t.

     To determine this equation, we start with the definition of angular acceleration:

     We rearrange this to get          and then we integrate both sides of this equation from initial values to final

     values, that is, from to t and    . In uniform rotational motion, the angular acceleration is constant so it can

     be pulled out of the integral, yielding two definite integrals:

Setting   , we have

We rearrange this to obtain

                                                                                                              10.11

where is the initial angular velocity. Equation 10.11 is the rotational counterpart to the linear kinematics

equation           . With Equation 10.11, we can find the angular velocity of an object at any specified time t

given the initial angular velocity and the angular acceleration.

Let's now do a similar treatment starting with the equation       . We rearrange it to obtain  and

integrate both sides from initial to final values again, noting that the angular acceleration is constant and does not
have a time dependence. However, this time, the angular velocity is not constant (in general), so we substitute in
what we derived above:

where we have set    . Now we rearrange to obtain

                                                                                                              10.12

Equation 10.12 is the rotational counterpart to the linear kinematics equation found in Motion Along a Straight Line
for position as a function of time. This equation gives us the angular position of a rotating rigid body at any time t
given the initial conditions (initial angular position and initial angular velocity) and the angular acceleration.

We can find an equation that is independent of time by solving for t in Equation 10.11 and substituting into Equation
10.12. Equation 10.12 becomes

or
                                                                                                                                                   10.13

Equation 10.10 through Equation 10.13 describe fixed-axis rotation for constant acceleration and are summarized
in Table 10.1.

     the equations can be applied to everyday situations.

     Calculating the Acceleration of a Fishing Reel

     A deep-sea fisherman hooks a big fish that swims away from the boat, pulling the fishing line from his fishing reel.

     The whole system is initially at rest, and the fishing line unwinds from the reel at a radius of 4.50 cm from its axis of

     rotation. The reel is given an angular acceleration of         for 2.00 s (Figure 10.11).

     (a) What is the final angular velocity of the reel after 2 s?

     (b) How many revolutions does the reel make?

     Strategy
     Identify the knowns and compare with the kinematic equations for constant acceleration. Look for the appropriate

Converting radians to revolutions gives

Significance

This example illustrates that relationships among rotational quantities are highly analogous to those among linear
quantities. The answers to the questions are realistic. After unwinding for two seconds, the reel is found to spin at
220 rad/s, which is 2100 rpm. (No wonder reels sometimes make high-pitched sounds.)

In the preceding example, we considered a fishing reel with a positive angular acceleration. Now let us consider
what happens with a negative angular acceleration.

Now the fisherman applies a brake to the spinning reel, achieving an angular acceleration of
does it take the reel to come to a stop?

Strategy

We are asked to find the time t for the reel to come to a stop. The initial and final conditions are different from those
in the previous problem, which involved the same fishing reel. Now we see that the initial angular velocity is

                and the final angular velocity is zero. The angular acceleration is given as

Examining the available equations, we see all quantities but t are known in  , making it easiest to use

this equation.

Solution
The equation states

We solve the equation algebraically for t and then substitute the known values as usual, yielding

Significance
Note that care must be taken with the signs that indicate the directions of various quantities. Also, note that the time
to stop the reel is fairly small because the acceleration is rather large. Fishing lines sometimes snap because of the
accelerations involved, and fishermen often let the fish swim for a while before applying brakes on the reel. A tired
fish is slower, requiring a smaller acceleration.

     Strategy

     a. Since the angular velocity varies linearly with time, we know that the angular acceleration is constant and
          does not depend on the time variable. The angular acceleration is the slope of the angular velocity vs. time

     graph,         . To calculate the slope, we read directly from Figure 10.12, and see that                     at

               and                    at  . Then, we can verify the result using                                .

     b. We use the equation               since the time derivative of the angle is the angular velocity, we can find the

     angular displacement by integrating the angular velocity, which from the figure means taking the area under
     the angular velocity graph. In other words:

Significance

We see from part (b) that there are alternative approaches to analyzing fixed-axis rotation with constant
acceleration. We started with a graphical approach and verified the solution using the rotational kinematic

equations. Since  , we could do the same graphical analysis on an angular acceleration-vs.-time curve. The

area under an     curve gives us the change in angular velocity. Since the angular acceleration is constant in this

section, this is a straightforward exercise.

10.3 Relating Angular and Translational Quantities

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Given the linear kinematic equation, write the corresponding rotational kinematic equation
    · Calculate the linear distances, velocities, and accelerations of points on a rotating system given the

        angular velocities and accelerations

In this section, we relate each of the rotational variables to the translational variables defined in Motion Along a
Straight Line and Motion in Two and Three Dimensions. This will complete our ability to describe rigid-body
rotations.

Angular vs. Linear Variables

In Rotational Variables, we introduced angular variables. If we compare the rotational definitions with the
definitions of linear kinematic variables from Motion Along a Straight Line and Motion in Two and Three Dimensions,
we find that there is a mapping of the linear variables to the rotational ones. Linear position, velocity, and
acceleration have their rotational counterparts, as we can see when we write them side by side:

                               Acceleration

     Let's compare the linear and rotational variables individually. The linear variable of position has physical units of

     meters, whereas the angular position variable has dimensionless units of radians, as can be seen from the definition

     of  , which is the ratio of two lengths. The linear velocity has units of m/s, and its counterpart, the angular

     velocity, has units of rad/s. In Rotational Variables, we saw in the case of circular motion that the linear tangential

     speed of a particle at a radius r from the axis of rotation is related to the angular velocity by the relation       .

     This could also apply to points on a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis. Here, we consider only circular motion. In

     circular motion, both uniform and nonuniform, there exists a centripetal acceleration (Motion in Two and Three

     Dimensions). The centripetal acceleration vector points inward from the particle executing circular motion toward

     the axis of rotation. The derivation of the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is given in Motion in Two and

     Three Dimensions. From that derivation, the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration was found to be

                                                                                                                     10.14

     where r is the radius of the circle.

     Thus, in uniform circular motion when the angular velocity is constant and the angular acceleration is zero, we have
     a linear acceleration--that is, centripetal acceleration--since the tangential speed in Equation 10.14 is a constant. If
     nonuniform circular motion is present, the rotating system has an angular acceleration, and we have both a linear
     centripetal acceleration that is changing (because is changing) as well as a linear tangential acceleration. These
     relationships are shown in Figure 10.14, where we show the centripetal and tangential accelerations for uniform
     and nonuniform circular motion.

     FIGURE 10.14 (a) Uniform circular motion: The centripetal acceleration has its vector inward toward the axis of rotation. There is no
     tangential acceleration. (b) Nonuniform circular motion: An angular acceleration produces an inward centripetal acceleration that is

acceleration is due to any change in the magnitude of the tangential velocity. The tangential and centripetal
acceleration vectors and are always perpendicular to each other, as seen in Figure 10.14. To complete this
description, we can assign a total linear acceleration vector to a point on a rotating rigid body or a particle
executing circular motion at a radius r from a fixed axis. The total linear acceleration vector is the vector sum of
the centripetal and tangential accelerations,

                                                                                                                                                   10.15

The total linear acceleration vector in the case of nonuniform circular motion points at an angle between the

centripetal and tangential acceleration vectors, as shown in Figure 10.15. Since  , the magnitude of the total

linear acceleration is

Note that if the angular acceleration is zero, the total linear acceleration is equal to the centripetal acceleration.

vector sum of the centripetal acceleration and tangential acceleration vectors. The total linear acceleration vector is at an angle in between
the centripetal and tangential accelerations.

Relationships between Rotational and Translational Motion

We can look at two relationships between rotational and translational motion.

1. Generally speaking, the linear kinematic equations have their rotational counterparts. Table 10.2 lists the four
     linear kinematic equations and the corresponding rotational counterpart. The two sets of equations look
     similar to each other, but describe two different physical situations, that is, rotation and translation.

                                                     Equations

2. The second correspondence has to do with relating linear and rotational variables in the special case of
     circular motion. This is shown in Table 10.3, where in the third column, we have listed the connecting equation
     that relates the linear variable to the rotational variable. The rotational variables of angular velocity and

     EXAMPLE 10.7

     Linear Acceleration of a Centrifuge

     A centrifuge has a radius of 20 cm and accelerates from a maximum rotation rate of 10,000 rpm to rest in 30

     seconds under a constant angular acceleration. It is rotating counterclockwise. What is the magnitude of the total

     acceleration of a point at the tip of the centrifuge at    What is the direction of the total acceleration vector?

     Strategy

     With the information given, we can calculate the angular acceleration, which then will allow us to find the tangential

     acceleration. We can find the centripetal acceleration at  by calculating the tangential speed at this time. With

     the magnitudes of the accelerations, we can calculate the total linear acceleration. From the description of the

     rotation in the problem, we can sketch the direction of the total acceleration vector.

     Solution
     The angular acceleration is

     Therefore, the tangential acceleration is

     The angular velocity at          is

     Thus, the tangential speed at              is

     We can now calculate the centripetal acceleration at       :

     Since the two acceleration vectors are perpendicular to each other, the magnitude of the total linear acceleration is

     Since the centrifuge has a negative angular acceleration, it is slowing down. The total acceleration vector is as
     shown in Figure 10.16. The angle with respect to the centripetal acceleration vector is

The negative sign means that the total acceleration vector is angled toward the clockwise direction.

FIGURE 10.16 The centripetal, tangential, and total acceleration vectors. The centrifuge is slowing down, so the tangential acceleration is
clockwise, opposite the direction of rotation (counterclockwise).

Significance
From Figure 10.16, we see that the tangential acceleration vector is opposite the direction of rotation. The
magnitude of the tangential acceleration is much smaller than the centripetal acceleration, so the total linear
acceleration vector will make a very small angle with respect to the centripetal acceleration vector.

10.4 Moment of Inertia and Rotational Kinetic Energy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe the differences between rotational and translational kinetic energy
    · Define the physical concept of moment of inertia in terms of the mass distribution from the rotational axis
    · Explain how the moment of inertia of rigid bodies affects their rotational kinetic energy
    · Use conservation of mechanical energy to analyze systems undergoing both rotation and translation
    · Calculate the angular velocity of a rotating system when there are energy losses due to nonconservative

        forces

So far in this chapter, we have been working with rotational kinematics: the description of motion for a rotating rigid
body with a fixed axis of rotation. In this section, we define two new quantities that are helpful for analyzing
properties of rotating objects: moment of inertia and rotational kinetic energy. With these properties defined, we will
468  10 · Fixed-Axis Rotation

     have two important tools we need for analyzing rotational dynamics.

     Rotational Kinetic Energy

     Any moving object has kinetic energy. We know how to calculate this for a body undergoing translational motion, but
     how about for a rigid body undergoing rotation? This might seem complicated because each point on the rigid body
     has a different velocity. However, we can make use of angular velocity--which is the same for the entire rigid
     body--to express the kinetic energy for a rotating object. Figure 10.17 shows an example of a very energetic rotating
     body: an electric grindstone propelled by a motor. Sparks are flying, and noise and vibration are generated as the
     grindstone does its work. This system has considerable energy, some of it in the form of heat, light, sound, and
     vibration. However, most of this energy is in the form of rotational kinetic energy.

     FIGURE 10.17 The rotational kinetic energy of the grindstone is converted to heat, light, sound, and vibration. (credit: Zachary David Bell,
     US Navy)

     Energy in rotational motion is not a new form of energy; rather, it is the energy associated with rotational motion, the

     same as kinetic energy in translational motion. However, because kinetic energy is given by               , and

     velocity is a quantity that is different for every point on a rotating body about an axis, it makes sense to find a way to

     write kinetic energy in terms of the variable , which is the same for all points on a rigid rotating body. For a single

     particle rotating around a fixed axis, this is straightforward to calculate. We can relate the angular velocity to the

     magnitude of the translational velocity using the relation  , where r is the distance of the particle from the

     axis of rotation and is its tangential speed. Substituting into the equation for kinetic energy, we find

     In the case of a rigid rotating body, we can divide up any body into a large number of smaller masses, each with a

     mass and distance to the axis of rotation , such that the total mass of the body is equal to the sum of the

     individual masses:               . Each smaller mass has tangential speed , where we have dropped the subscript t

     for the moment. The total kinetic energy of the rigid rotating body is

     and since  for all masses,

                                                                                                                  10.16

The units of Equation 10.16 are joules (J). The equation in this form is complete, but awkward; we need to find a
way to generalize it.

Moment of Inertia

If we compare Equation 10.16 to the way we wrote kinetic energy in Work and Kinetic Energy,               , this

suggests we have a new rotational variable to add to our list of our relations between rotational and translational

variables. The quantity  is the counterpart for mass in the equation for rotational kinetic energy. This is an

important new term for rotational motion. This quantity is called the moment of inertia I, with units of          :

                                                                                                                  10.17

For now, we leave the expression in summation form, representing the moment of inertia of a system of point
particles rotating about a fixed axis. We note that the moment of inertia of a single point particle about a fixed axis is
simply , with r being the distance from the point particle to the axis of rotation. In the next section, we explore
the integral form of this equation, which can be used to calculate the moment of inertia of some regular-shaped rigid
bodies.

The moment of inertia is the quantitative measure of rotational inertia, just as in translational motion, and mass is
the quantitative measure of linear inertia--that is, the more massive an object is, the more inertia it has, and the
greater is its resistance to change in linear velocity. Similarly, the greater the moment of inertia of a rigid body or
system of particles, the greater is its resistance to change in angular velocity about a fixed axis of rotation. It is
interesting to see how the moment of inertia varies with r, the distance to the axis of rotation of the mass particles in
Equation 10.17. Rigid bodies and systems of particles with more mass concentrated at a greater distance from the
axis of rotation have greater moments of inertia than bodies and systems of the same mass, but concentrated near
the axis of rotation. In this way, we can see that a hollow cylinder has more rotational inertia than a solid cylinder of
the same mass when rotating about an axis through the center. Substituting Equation 10.17 into Equation 10.16, the
expression for the kinetic energy of a rotating rigid body becomes

                                                                                                                                                   10.18

We see from this equation that the kinetic energy of a rotating rigid body is directly proportional to the moment of
inertia and the square of the angular velocity. This is exploited in flywheel energy-storage devices, which are
designed to store large amounts of rotational kinetic energy. Many carmakers are now testing flywheel energy
storage devices in their automobiles, such as the flywheel, or kinetic energy recovery system, shown in Figure
10.18.

     The rotational and translational quantities for kinetic energy and inertia are summarized in Table 10.4. The
     relationship column is not included because a constant doesn't exist by which we could multiply the rotational
     quantity to get the translational quantity, as can be done for the variables in Table 10.3.

a. We use the definition for moment of inertia for a system of particles and perform the summation to evaluate
     this quantity. The masses are all the same so we can pull that quantity in front of the summation symbol.

Significance
We can see the individual contributions to the moment of inertia. The masses close to the axis of rotation have a
very small contribution. When we removed them, it had a very small effect on the moment of inertia.

In the next section, we generalize the summation equation for point particles and develop a method to calculate
moments of inertia for rigid bodies. For now, though, Figure 10.20 gives values of moment of inertia for common
object shapes around specified axes.

     Applying Rotational Kinetic Energy

     Now let's apply the ideas of rotational kinetic energy and the moment of inertia table to get a feeling for the energy
     associated with a few rotating objects. The following examples will also help get you comfortable using these
     equations. First, let's look at a general problem-solving strategy for rotational energy.

     PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Rotational Energy

     1. Determine that energy or work is involved in the rotation.

     2. Determine the system of interest. A sketch usually helps.

     3. Analyze the situation to determine the types of work and energy involved.

     4. If there are no losses of energy due to friction and other nonconservative forces, mechanical energy is

     conserved, that is,              .

     5. If nonconservative forces are present, mechanical energy is not conserved, and other forms of energy, such as

     heat and light, may enter or leave the system. Determine what they are and calculate them as necessary.

     6. Eliminate terms wherever possible to simplify the algebra.

     7. Evaluate the numerical solution to see if it makes sense in the physical situation presented in the wording of

     the problem.

Calculating Helicopter Energies

A typical small rescue helicopter has four blades: Each is 4.00 m long and has a mass of 50.0 kg (Figure 10.21). The
blades can be approximated as thin rods that rotate about one end of an axis perpendicular to their length. The
helicopter has a total loaded mass of 1000 kg. (a) Calculate the rotational kinetic energy in the blades when they
rotate at 300 rpm. (b) Calculate the translational kinetic energy of the helicopter when it flies at 20.0 m/s, and
compare it with the rotational energy in the blades.

Helicopter Service. (credit b: modification of work by "111 Emergency"/Flickr)

Strategy
Rotational and translational kinetic energies can be calculated from their definitions. The wording of the problem
gives all the necessary constants to evaluate the expressions for the rotational and translational kinetic energies.
Solution

  a. The rotational kinetic energy is

        We must convert the angular velocity to radians per second and calculate the moment of inertia before we can
       find K. The angular velocity is

       The moment of inertia of one blade is that of a thin rod rotated about its end, listed in Figure 10.20. The total I
        is four times this moment of inertia because there are four blades. Thus,

       Entering and I into the expression for rotational kinetic energy gives

  b. Entering the given values into the equation for translational kinetic energy, we obtain

        To compare kinetic energies, we take the ratio of translational kinetic energy to rotational kinetic energy. This
        ratio is
474  10 · Fixed-Axis Rotation

     Significance
     The ratio of translational energy to rotational kinetic energy is only 0.380. This ratio tells us that most of the kinetic
     energy of the helicopter is in its spinning blades.

     Energy in a Boomerang

     A person hurls a boomerang into the air with a velocity of 30.0 m/s at an angle of  with respect to the

     horizontal (Figure 10.22). It has a mass of 1.0 kg and is rotating at 10.0 rev/s. The moment of inertia of the

     boomerang is given as            where      . (a) What is the total energy of the boomerang when it leaves

     the hand? (b) How high does the boomerang go from the elevation of the hand, neglecting air resistance?

                               FIGURE 10.22 A boomerang is hurled into the air at an initial angle of .

     Strategy

     We use the definitions of rotational and linear kinetic energy to find the total energy of the system. The problem
     states to neglect air resistance, so we don't have to worry about energy loss. In part (b), we use conservation of
     mechanical energy to find the maximum height of the boomerang.

     Solution

     a. Moment of inertia:                          .

     Angular velocity:                           .

     The rotational kinetic energy is therefore

     The translational kinetic energy is

          Thus, the total energy in the boomerang is

     b. We use conservation of mechanical energy. Since the boomerang is launched at an angle, we need to write the
          total energies of the system in terms of its linear kinetic energies using the velocity in the x- and y-directions.
          The total energy when the boomerang leaves the hand is

By conservation of mechanical energy,                     so we have, after canceling like terms,

Since                                  , we find

Significance

In part (b), the solution demonstrates how energy conservation is an alternative method to solve a problem that
normally would be solved using kinematics. In the absence of air resistance, the rotational kinetic energy was not a
factor in the solution for the maximum height.

10.5 Calculating Moments of Inertia

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Calculate the moment of inertia for uniformly shaped, rigid bodies
    · Apply the parallel axis theorem to find the moment of inertia about any axis parallel to one already known
    · Calculate the moment of inertia for compound objects

In the preceding section, we defined the moment of inertia but did not show how to calculate it. In this section, we
show how to calculate the moment of inertia for several standard types of objects, as well as how to use known
moments of inertia to find the moment of inertia for a shifted axis or for a compound object. This section is very
useful for seeing how to apply a general equation to complex objects (a skill that is critical for more advanced
physics and engineering courses).

Moment of Inertia

We defined the moment of inertia I of an object to be     for all the point masses that make up the object.

Because r is the distance to the axis of rotation from each piece of mass that makes up the object, the moment of
inertia for any object depends on the chosen axis. To see this, let's take a simple example of two masses at the end
of a massless (negligibly small mass) rod (Figure 10.23) and calculate the moment of inertia about two different
axes. In this case, the summation over the masses is simple because the two masses at the end of the barbell can
be approximated as point masses, and the sum therefore has only two terms.

In the case with the axis in the center of the barbell, each of the two masses m is a distance R away from the axis,
giving a moment of inertia of

In the case with the axis at the end of the barbell--passing through one of the masses--the moment of inertia is

From this result, we can conclude that it is twice as hard to rotate the barbell about the end than about its center.
476  10 · Fixed-Axis Rotation

                FIGURE 10.23 (a) A barbell with an axis of rotation through its center; (b) a barbell with an axis of rotation through one end.

     In this example, we had two point masses and the sum was simple to calculate. However, to deal with objects that
     are not point-like, we need to think carefully about each of the terms in the equation. The equation asks us to sum
     over each `piece of mass' a certain distance from the axis of rotation. But what exactly does each `piece of mass'
     mean? Recall that in our derivation of this equation, each piece of mass had the same magnitude of velocity, which
     means the whole piece had to have a single distance r to the axis of rotation. However, this is not possible unless we
     take an infinitesimally small piece of mass dm, as shown in Figure 10.24.

                   FIGURE 10.24 Using an infinitesimally small piece of mass to calculate the contribution to the total moment of inertia.

     The need to use an infinitesimally small piece of mass dm suggests that we can write the moment of inertia by
     evaluating an integral over infinitesimal masses rather than doing a discrete sum over finite masses:

                                                                                                                                                        10.19

     This, in fact, is the form we need to generalize the equation for complex shapes. It is best to work out specific
     examples in detail to get a feel for how to calculate the moment of inertia for specific shapes. This is the focus of
     most of the rest of this section.
     A uniform thin rod with an axis through the center
     Consider a uniform (density and shape) thin rod of mass M and length L as shown in Figure 10.25. We want a thin
     rod so that we can assume the cross-sectional area of the rod is small and the rod can be thought of as a string of
     masses along a one-dimensional straight line. In this example, the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the rod and
     passes through the midpoint for simplicity. Our task is to calculate the moment of inertia about this axis. We orient
     the axes so that the z-axis is the axis of rotation and the x-axis passes through the length of the rod, as shown in the
     figure. This is a convenient choice because we can then integrate along the x-axis.

              FIGURE 10.25 Calculation of the moment of inertia I for a uniform thin rod about an axis through the center of the rod.

We define dm to be a small element of mass making up the rod. The moment of inertia integral is an integral over
the mass distribution. However, we know how to integrate over space, not over mass. We therefore need to find a
way to relate mass to spatial variables. We do this using the linear mass density of the object, which is the mass
per unit length. Since the mass density of this object is uniform, we can write

If we take the differential of each side of this equation, we find

since is constant. We chose to orient the rod along the x-axis for convenience--this is where that choice becomes

very helpful. Note that a piece of the rod dl lies completely along the x-axis and has a length dx; in fact,  in

this situation. We can therefore write      , giving us an integration variable that we know how to deal with.

The distance of each piece of mass dm from the axis is given by the variable x, as shown in the figure. Putting this all

together, we obtain

The last step is to be careful about our limits of integration. The rod extends from      to                  , since the

axis is in the middle of the rod at     . This gives us

Next, we calculate the moment of inertia for the same uniform thin rod but with a different axis choice so we can
compare the results. We would expect the moment of inertia to be smaller about an axis through the center of mass
than the endpoint axis, just as it was for the barbell example at the start of this section. This happens because more
mass is distributed farther from the axis of rotation.

A uniform thin rod with axis at the end
Now consider the same uniform thin rod of mass M and length L, but this time we move the axis of rotation to the
end of the rod. We wish to find the moment of inertia about this new axis (Figure 10.26). The quantity dm is again
defined to be a small element of mass making up the rod. Just as before, we obtain

However, this time we have different limits of integration. The rod extends from      to      , since the axis is at

the end of the rod at  . Therefore we find

     Note the rotational inertia of the rod about its endpoint is larger than the rotational inertia about its center
     (consistent with the barbell example) by a factor of four.

     The Parallel-Axis Theorem

     The similarity between the process of finding the moment of inertia of a rod about an axis through its middle and
     about an axis through its end is striking, and suggests that there might be a simpler method for determining the
     moment of inertia for a rod about any axis parallel to the axis through the center of mass. Such an axis is called a
     parallel axis. There is a theorem for this, called the parallel-axis theorem, which we state here but do not derive in
     this text.

       PARALLEL-AXIS THEOREM

       Let m be the mass of an object and let d be the distance from an axis through the object's center of mass to a
       new axis. Then we have

                                                                                                                                                     10.20

     Let's apply this to the rod examples solved above:

     This result agrees with our more lengthy calculation from above. This is a useful equation that we apply in some of
     the examples and problems.

                              FIGURE 10.27 Calculating the moment of inertia for a thin disk about an axis through its center.

Since the disk is thin, we can take the mass as distributed entirely in the xy-plane. We again start with the
relationship for the surface mass density, which is the mass per unit surface area. Since it is uniform, the surface
mass density is constant:

Now we use a simplification for the area. The area can be thought of as made up of a series of thin rings, where each
ring is a mass increment dm of radius r equidistant from the axis, as shown in part (b) of the figure. The infinitesimal
area of each ring dA is therefore given by the length of each ring ( ) times the infinitesimal width of each ring dr:

The full area of the disk is then made up from adding all the thin rings with a radius range from 0 to R. This radius

range then becomes our limits of integration for dr, that is, we integrate from  to  . Putting this all

together, we have

Note that this agrees with the value given in Figure 10.20.

Calculating the moment of inertia for compound objects
Now consider a compound object such as that in Figure 10.28, which depicts a thin disk at the end of a thin rod. This
cannot be easily integrated to find the moment of inertia because it is not a uniformly shaped object. However, if we
go back to the initial definition of moment of inertia as a summation, we can reason that a compound object's
moment of inertia can be found from the sum of each part of the object:

                                                                                                                                                   10.21

It is important to note that the moments of inertia of the objects in Equation 10.21 are about a common axis. In the

case of this object, that would be a rod of length L rotating about its end, and a thin disk of radius R rotating about an

axis shifted off of the center by a distance  , where R is the radius of the disk. Let's define the mass of the rod

to be and the mass of the disk to be

     of inertia of the disk about the axis shown. The moment of inertia of the disk about its center is            and we

     apply the parallel-axis theorem             to find

     Adding the moment of inertia of the rod plus the moment of inertia of the disk with a shifted axis of rotation, we find
     the moment of inertia for the compound object to be

     A 25-kg child stands at a distance          from the axis of a rotating merry-go-round (Figure 10.29). The merry-

     go-round can be approximated as a uniform solid disk with a mass of 500 kg and a radius of 2.0 m. Find the moment

     of inertia of this system.

     This problem involves the calculation of a moment of inertia. We are given the mass and distance to the axis of
     rotation of the child as well as the mass and radius of the merry-go-round. Since the mass and size of the child are
     much smaller than the merry-go-round, we can approximate the child as a point mass. The notation we use is

Strategy

Since we have a compound object in both cases, we can use the parallel-axis theorem to find the moment of inertia

about each axis. In (a), the center of mass of the sphere is located at a distance  from the axis of rotation. In

(b), the center of mass of the sphere is located a distance R from the axis of rotation. In both cases, the moment of

inertia of the rod is about an axis at one end. Refer to Table 10.4 for the moments of inertia for the individual

objects.

Significance

Using the parallel-axis theorem eases the computation of the moment of inertia of compound objects. We see that

the moment of inertia is greater in (a) than (b). This is because the axis of rotation is closer to the center of mass of

the system in (b). The simple analogy is that of a rod. The moment of inertia about one end is  , but the

10.6 Torque

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe how the magnitude of a torque depends on the magnitude of the lever arm and the angle the
        force vector makes with the lever arm

    · Determine the sign (positive or negative) of a torque using the right-hand rule
    · Calculate individual torques about a common axis and sum them to find the net torque

An important quantity for describing the dynamics of a rotating rigid body is torque. We see the application of torque
in many ways in our world. We all have an intuition about torque, as when we use a large wrench to unscrew a
stubborn bolt. Torque is at work in unseen ways, as when we press on the accelerator in a car, causing the engine to
put additional torque on the drive train. Or every time we move our bodies from a standing position, we apply a
torque to our limbs. In this section, we define torque and make an argument for the equation for calculating torque
for a rigid body with fixed-axis rotation.

Defining Torque

So far we have defined many variables that are rotational equivalents to their translational counterparts. Let's
consider what the counterpart to force must be. Since forces change the translational motion of objects, the
rotational counterpart must be related to changing the rotational motion of an object about an axis. We call this
rotational counterpart torque.

In everyday life, we rotate objects about an axis all the time, so intuitively we already know much about torque.
Consider, for example, how we rotate a door to open it. First, we know that a door opens slowly if we push too close
to its hinges; it is more efficient to rotate a door open if we push far from the hinges. Second, we know that we
should push perpendicular to the plane of the door; if we push parallel to the plane of the door, we are not able to
rotate it. Third, the larger the force, the more effective it is in opening the door; the harder you push, the more
rapidly the door opens. The first point implies that the farther the force is applied from the axis of rotation, the
greater the angular acceleration; the second implies that the effectiveness depends on the angle at which the force
is applied; the third implies that the magnitude of the force must also be part of the equation. Note that for rotation
in a plane, torque has two possible directions. Torque is either clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the chosen
pivot point. Figure 10.31 shows counterclockwise rotations.

FIGURE 10.31 Torque is the turning or twisting effectiveness of a force, illustrated here for door rotation on its hinges (as viewed from
overhead). Torque has both magnitude and direction. (a) A counterclockwise torque is produced by a force acting at a distance r from the
hinges (the pivot point). (b) A smaller counterclockwise torque is produced when a smaller force acts at the same distance r from the
484  10 · Fixed-Axis Rotation

     hinges. (c) The same force as in (a) produces a smaller counterclockwise torque when applied at a smaller distance from the hinges. (d) A
     smaller counterclockwise torque is produced by the same magnitude force as (a) acting at the same distance as (a) but at an angle that is
     less than .

     Now let's consider how to define torques in the general three-dimensional case.

       TORQUE

       When a force is applied to a point P whose position is relative to O (Figure 10.32), the torque around O is
                                                                                                                                                     10.22

     FIGURE 10.32 The torque is perpendicular to the plane defined by  and its direction is determined by the right-hand rule.

     From the definition of the cross product, the torque is perpendicular to the plane containing       and has
     magnitude

     where is the angle between the vectors and . The SI unit of torque is newtons times meters, usually written as

     . The quantity                   is the perpendicular distance from O to the line determined by the vector and is

     called the lever arm. Note that the greater the lever arm, the greater the magnitude of the torque. In terms of the

     lever arm, the magnitude of the torque is

                                                                                                         10.23

     The cross product         also tells us the sign of the torque. In Figure 10.32, the cross product  is along the

     positive z-axis, which by convention is a positive torque. If     is along the negative z-axis, this produces a
     negative torque.

     If we consider a disk that is free to rotate about an axis through the center, as shown in Figure 10.33, we can see
     how the angle between the radius and the force affects the magnitude of the torque. If the angle is zero, the
     torque is zero; if the angle is , the torque is maximum. The torque in Figure 10.33 is positive because the

counterclockwise due to the torque, in the same direction as a positive angular acceleration.

FIGURE 10.33 A disk is free to rotate about its axis through the center. The magnitude of the torque on the disk is  .When  , the

torque is zero and the disk does not rotate. When  , the torque is maximum and the disk rotates with maximum angular acceleration.

Any number of torques can be calculated about a given axis. The individual torques add to produce a net torque
about the axis. When the appropriate sign (positive or negative) is assigned to the magnitudes of individual torques
about a specified axis, the net torque about the axis is the sum of the individual torques:

                                                                                                                            10.24

In the following examples, we calculate the torque both abstractly and as applied to a rigid body.
We first introduce a problem-solving strategy.

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Finding Net Torque

        system.

  2. Determine the angle between the lever arm and the force vector.

3. Take the cross product of  to determine if the torque is positive or negative about the pivot point or

axis.

4. Evaluate the magnitude of the torque using .

5. Assign the appropriate sign, positive or negative, to the magnitude.

6. Sum the torques to find the net torque.

We start with . If we look at Figure 10.35, we see that makes an angle of            with the radius vector .

Taking the cross product, we see that it is out of the page and so is positive. We also see this from calculating its

magnitude:

Next we look at . The angle between  and is  and the cross product is into the page so the torque is
negative. Its value is

When we evaluate the torque due to , we see that the angle it makes with is zero so  Therefore,

We evaluate the sum of the torques:

Significance
The axis of rotation is at the center of mass of the flywheel. Since the flywheel is on a fixed axis, it is not free to
translate. If it were on a frictionless surface and not fixed in place, would cause the flywheel to translate, as well
as . Its motion would be a combination of translation and rotation.

     In this section, we put together all the pieces learned so far in this chapter to analyze the dynamics of rotating rigid
     bodies. We have analyzed motion with kinematics and rotational kinetic energy but have not yet connected these
     ideas with force and/or torque. In this section, we introduce the rotational equivalent to Newton's second law of

     We have thus far found many counterparts to the translational terms used throughout this text, most recently,
     torque, the rotational analog to force. This raises the question: Is there an analogous equation to Newton's second

     law,          which involves torque and rotational motion? To investigate this, we start with Newton's second law

     for a single particle rotating around an axis and executing circular motion. Let's exert a force on a point mass m
     that is at a distance r from a pivot point (Figure 10.37). The particle is constrained to move in a circular path with
     fixed radius and the force is tangent to the circle. We apply Newton's second law to determine the magnitude of the

     acceleration              in the direction of . Recall that the magnitude of the tangential acceleration is proportional

     to the magnitude of the angular acceleration by      . Substituting this expression into Newton's second law, we

force. A force is applied to the object perpendicular to the radius r, causing it to accelerate about the pivot point. The force is
perpendicular to r.

Multiply both sides of this equation by r,

Note that the left side of this equation is the torque about the axis of rotation, where r is the lever arm and F is the

force, perpendicular to r. Recall that the moment of inertia for a point particle is  . The torque applied

perpendicularly to the point mass in Figure 10.37 is therefore

The torque on the particle is equal to the moment of inertia about the rotation axis times the angular acceleration.
We can generalize this equation to a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis.

  If more than one torque acts on a rigid body about a fixed axis, then the sum of the torques equals the moment
  of inertia times the angular acceleration:

                                                                                                                                                10.25

The term is a scalar quantity and can be positive or negative (counterclockwise or clockwise) depending upon
the sign of the net torque. Remember the convention that counterclockwise angular acceleration is positive. Thus, if
a rigid body is rotating clockwise and experiences a positive torque (counterclockwise), the angular acceleration is
positive.

Equation 10.25 is Newton's second law for rotation and tells us how to relate torque, moment of inertia, and
rotational kinematics. This is called the equation for rotational dynamics. With this equation, we can solve a whole
class of problems involving force and rotation. It makes sense that the relationship for how much force it takes to
rotate a body would include the moment of inertia, since that is the quantity that tells us how easy or hard it is to
change the rotational motion of an object.

Deriving Newton's Second Law for Rotation in Vector Form

As before, when we found the angular acceleration, we may also find the torque vector. The second law
tells us the relationship between net force and how to change the translational motion of an object. We have a
vector rotational equivalent of this equation, which can be found by using Equation 10.7 and Figure 10.8. Equation
10.7 relates the angular acceleration to the position and tangential acceleration vectors:

We form the cross product of this equation with and use a cross product identity (note that  ):
490  10 · Fixed-Axis Rotation

     We now form the cross product of Newton's second law with the position vector

     Identifying the first term on the left as the sum of the torques, and  as the moment of inertia, we arrive at
     Newton's second law of rotation in vector form:                                                                          10.26

     This equation is exactly Equation 10.25 but with the torque and angular acceleration as vectors. An important point
     is that the torque vector is in the same direction as the angular acceleration.

     Applying the Rotational Dynamics Equation

     Before we apply the rotational dynamics equation to some everyday situations, let's review a general problem-
     solving strategy for use with this category of problems.

     PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Rotational Dynamics

     1. Examine the situation to determine that torque and mass are involved in the rotation. Draw a careful sketch of

     the situation.

     2. Determine the system of interest.

     3. Draw a free-body diagram. That is, draw and label all external forces acting on the system of interest.

     4. Identify the pivot point. If the object is in equilibrium, it must be in equilibrium for all possible pivot

     points--chose the one that simplifies your work the most.

     5. Apply                  , the rotational equivalent of Newton's second law, to solve the problem. Care must be taken

          to use the correct moment of inertia and to consider the torque about the point of rotation.
     6. As always, check the solution to see if it is reasonable.

             EXAMPLE 10.16

     Calculating the Effect of Mass Distribution on a Merry-Go-Round

     Consider the father pushing a playground merry-go-round in Figure 10.38. He exerts a force of 250 N at the edge of
     the 50.0-kg merry-go-round, which has a 1.50-m radius. Calculate the angular acceleration produced (a) when no
     one is on the merry-go-round and (b) when an 18.0-kg child sits 1.25 m away from the center. Consider the merry-
     go-round itself to be a uniform disk with negligible friction.

Strategy                                                 , To solve for , we must first calculate the net torque
The net torque is given directly by the expression

(which is the same in both cases) and moment of inertia I (which is greater in the second case).
Solution

  a. The moment of inertia of a solid disk about this axis is given in Figure 10.20 to be

We have  and  , so

To find the net torque, we note that the applied force is perpendicular to the radius and friction is negligible, so
that

Now, after we substitute the known values, we find the angular acceleration to be

b. We expect the angular acceleration for the system to be less in this part because the moment of inertia is
     greater when the child is on the merry-go-round. To find the total moment of inertia I, we first find the child's
     moment of inertia by approximating the child as a point mass at a distance of 1.25 m from the axis. Then

     The total moment of inertia is the sum of the moments of inertia of the merry-go-round and the child (about
     the same axis):

     Substituting known values into the equation for  gives

Significance

The angular acceleration is less when the child is on the merry-go-round than when the merry-go-round is empty, as
expected. The angular accelerations found are quite large, partly due to the fact that friction was considered to be
negligible. If, for example, the father kept pushing perpendicularly for 2.00 s, he would give the merry-go-round an
angular velocity of 13.3 rad/s when it is empty but only 8.89 rad/s when the child is on it. In terms of revolutions per
second, these angular velocities are 2.12 rev/s and 1.41 rev/s, respectively. The father would end up running at
about 50 km/h in the first case.

     10.8 Work and Power for Rotational Motion

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Use the work-energy theorem to analyze rotation to find the work done on a system when it is rotated
             about a fixed axis for a finite angular displacement

         · Solve for the angular velocity of a rotating rigid body using the work-energy theorem
         · Find the power delivered to a rotating rigid body given the applied torque and angular velocity
         · Summarize the rotational variables and equations and relate them to their translational counterparts

     Thus far in the chapter, we have extensively addressed kinematics and dynamics for rotating rigid bodies around a
     fixed axis. In this final section, we define work and power within the context of rotation about a fixed axis, which has
     applications to both physics and engineering. The discussion of work and power makes our treatment of rotational
     motion almost complete, with the exception of rolling motion and angular momentum, which are discussed in
     Angular Momentum. We begin this section with a treatment of the work-energy theorem for rotation.

     Work for Rotational Motion

     Now that we have determined how to calculate kinetic energy for rotating rigid bodies, we can proceed with a
     discussion of the work done on a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis. Figure 10.39 shows a rigid body that has
     rotated through an angle from A to B while under the influence of a force . The external force is applied to
     point P, whose position is , and the rigid body is constrained to rotate about a fixed axis that is perpendicular to the
     page and passes through O. The rotational axis is fixed, so the vector moves in a circle of radius r, and the vector

         is perpendicular to

                 FIGURE 10.39 A rigid body rotates through an angle  from A to B by the action of an external force applied to point P.

     From Equation 10.2, we have

     Thus,

where we used the identity                               . Noting that                  , we arrive at the expression
for the rotational work done on a rigid body:                                                                        10.27

The total work done on a rigid body is the sum of the torques integrated over the angle through which the body
rotates. The incremental work is

                                                                                                                                                   10.28

where we have taken the dot product in Equation 10.27, leaving only torques along the axis of rotation. In a rigid
body, all particles rotate through the same angle; thus the work of every external force is equal to the torque times

the common incremental angle . The quantity              is the net torque on the body due to external forces.

Similarly, we found the kinetic energy of a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis by summing the kinetic energy of

each particle that makes up the rigid body. Since the work-energy theorem               is valid for each particle, it is

valid for the sum of the particles and the entire body.

WORK-ENERGY THEOREM FOR ROTATION                                                        10.29

The work-energy theorem for a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis is

where

and the rotational work done by a net force rotating a body from point A to point B is

                                                                                        10.30

We give a strategy for using this equation when analyzing rotational motion.

        PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Work-Energy Theorem for Rotational Motion

  1. Identify the forces on the body and draw a free-body diagram. Calculate the torque for each force.
  2. Calculate the work done during the body's rotation by every torque.
  3. Apply the work-energy theorem by equating the net work done on the body to the change in rotational kinetic

        energy.

Let's look at two examples and use the work-energy theorem to analyze rotational motion.

     Rotational Work and Energy

     A             torque is applied to a flywheel that rotates about a fixed axis and has a moment of inertia of

                   . If the flywheel is initially at rest, what is its angular velocity after it has turned through eight

     revolutions?

     Strategy
     We apply the work-energy theorem. We know from the problem description what the torque is and the angular
     displacement of the flywheel. Then we can solve for the final angular velocity.

     Solution
     The flywheel turns through eight revolutions, which is radians. The work done by the torque, which is constant
     and therefore can come outside the integral in Equation 10.30, is

     We apply the work-energy theorem:

     With                                                               , we have

     Therefore,

     This is the angular velocity of the flywheel after eight revolutions.

     The work-energy theorem provides an efficient way to analyze rotational motion, connecting torque with rotational
     kinetic energy.

Looking at the free-body diagram, we see that neither , the force on the bearings of the pulley, nor , the weight
of the pulley, exerts a torque around the rotational axis, and therefore does no work on the pulley. As the pulley

Solution                 has magnitude  , we have
Since the torque due to

If the force on the string acts through a distance of 1.0 m, we have, from the work-energy theorem,

Power for Rotational Motion

Power always comes up in the discussion of applications in engineering and physics. Power for rotational motion is
equally as important as power in linear motion and can be derived in a similar way as in linear motion when the force

is a constant. The linear power when the force is a constant is  . If the net torque is constant over the

angular displacement, Equation 10.25 simplifies and the net torque can be taken out of the integral. In the following

discussion, we assume the net torque is constant. We can apply the definition of power derived in Power to

rotational motion. From Work and Kinetic Energy, the instantaneous power (or just power) is defined as the rate of

doing work,

Angular Momentum

FIGURE 11.1 A helicopter has its main lift blades rotating to keep the aircraft airborne. Due to conservation of angular momentum, the
body of the helicopter would want to rotate in the opposite sense to the blades, if it were not for the small rotor on the tail of the aircraft,
which provides thrust to stabilize it.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
11.1 Rolling Motion
11.2 Angular Momentum
11.3 Conservation of Angular Momentum
11.4 Precession of a Gyroscope
INTRODUCTION Angular momentum is the rotational counterpart of linear momentum. Any massive object that
rotates about an axis carries angular momentum, including rotating flywheels, planets, stars, hurricanes, tornadoes,
whirlpools, and so on. The helicopter shown in the chapter-opening picture can be used to illustrate the concept of
angular momentum. The lift blades spin about a vertical axis through the main body and carry angular momentum.
The body of the helicopter tends to rotate in the opposite sense in order to conserve angular momentum. The small
rotors at the tail of the aircraft provide a counter thrust against the body to prevent this from happening, and the
helicopter stabilizes itself. The concept of conservation of angular momentum is discussed later in this chapter. In
the main part of this chapter, we explore the intricacies of angular momentum of rigid bodies such as a top, and also
of point particles and systems of particles. But to be complete, we start with a discussion of rolling motion, which
builds upon the concepts of the previous chapter.

     11.1 Rolling Motion

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the physics of rolling motion without slipping
         · Explain how linear variables are related to angular variables for the case of rolling motion without slipping
         · Find the linear and angular accelerations in rolling motion with and without slipping
         · Calculate the static friction force associated with rolling motion without slipping
         · Use energy conservation to analyze rolling motion

     Rolling motion is that common combination of rotational and translational motion that we see everywhere, every
     day. Think about the different situations of wheels moving on a car along a highway, or wheels on a plane landing on
     a runway, or wheels on a robotic explorer on another planet. Understanding the forces and torques involved in
     rolling motion is a crucial factor in many different types of situations.

     For analyzing rolling motion in this chapter, refer to Figure 10.20 in Fixed-Axis Rotation to find moments of inertia of
     some common geometrical objects. You may also find it useful in other calculations involving rotation.

     Rolling Motion without Slipping

     People have observed rolling motion without slipping ever since the invention of the wheel. For example, we can
     look at the interaction of a car's tires and the surface of the road. If the driver depresses the accelerator to the floor,
     such that the tires spin without the car moving forward, there must be kinetic friction between the wheels and the
     surface of the road. If the driver depresses the accelerator slowly, causing the car to move forward, then the tires
     roll without slipping. It is surprising to most people that, in fact, the bottom of the wheel is at rest with respect to
     the ground, indicating there must be static friction between the tires and the road surface. In Figure 11.2, the
     bicycle is in motion with the rider staying upright. The tires have contact with the road surface, and, even though
     they are rolling, the bottoms of the tires deform slightly, do not slip, and are at rest with respect to the road surface
     for a measurable amount of time. There must be static friction between the tire and the road surface for this to be
     so.

     FIGURE 11.2 (a) The bicycle moves forward, and its tires do not slip. The bottom of the slightly deformed tire is at rest with respect to the
     road surface for a measurable amount of time. (b) This image shows that the top of a rolling wheel appears blurred by its motion, but the
     bottom of the wheel is instantaneously at rest. (credit a: modification of work by Nelson Lourenço; credit b: modification of work by Colin
     Rose)

     To analyze rolling without slipping, we first derive the linear variables of velocity and acceleration of the center of
     mass of the wheel in terms of the angular variables that describe the wheel's motion. The situation is shown in
     Figure 11.3.

FIGURE 11.3 (a) A wheel is pulled across a horizontal surface by a force . The force of static friction            is large enough to

keep it from slipping. (b) The linear velocity and acceleration vectors of the center of mass and the relevant expressions for  . Point P

is at rest relative to the surface. (c) Relative to the center of mass (CM) frame, point P has linear velocity  .

From Figure 11.3(a), we see the force vectors involved in preventing the wheel from slipping. In (b), point P that

touches the surface is at rest relative to the surface. Relative to the center of mass, point P has velocity                    ,

where R is the radius of the wheel and is the wheel's angular velocity about its axis. Since the wheel is rolling, the

velocity of P with respect to the surface is its velocity with respect to the center of mass plus the velocity of the

center of mass with respect to the surface:

Since the velocity of P relative to the surface is zero,  , this says that

                                                                                                                                   11.1

Thus, the velocity of the wheel's center of mass is its radius times the angular velocity about its axis. We show the
correspondence of the linear variable on the left side of the equation with the angular variable on the right side of
the equation. This is done below for the linear acceleration.

If we differentiate Equation 11.1 on the left side of the equation, we obtain an expression for the linear acceleration

of the center of mass. On the right side of the equation, R is a constant and since                             we have

                                                                                                                                   11.2

Furthermore, we can find the distance the wheel travels in terms of angular variables by referring to Figure 11.4. As

the wheel rolls from point A to point B, its outer surface maps onto the ground by exactly the distance travelled,

which is  We see from Figure 11.4 that the length of the outer surface that maps onto the ground is the arc

length  . Equating the two distances, we obtain

                                                                                                                                   11.3

     Rolling Down an Inclined Plane

     A solid cylinder rolls down an inclined plane without slipping, starting from rest. It has mass m and radius r. (a) What
     is its acceleration? (b) What condition must the coefficient of static friction satisfy so the cylinder does not slip?

     Strategy
     Draw a sketch and free-body diagram, and choose a coordinate system. We put x in the direction down the plane
     and y upward perpendicular to the plane. Identify the forces involved. These are the normal force, the force of
     gravity, and the force due to friction. Write down Newton's laws in the x- and y-directions, and Newton's law for
     rotation, and then solve for the acceleration and force due to friction.

     Solution

       a. The free-body diagram and sketch are shown in Figure 11.5, including the normal force, components of the
             weight, and the static friction force. There is barely enough friction to keep the cylinder rolling without
             slipping. Since there is no slipping, the magnitude of the friction force is less than or equal to . Writing
            down Newton's laws in the x- and y-directions, we have

              FIGURE 11.5 A solid cylinder rolls down an inclined plane without slipping from rest. The coordinate system has x in the direction
              down the inclined plane and y perpendicular to the plane. The free-body diagram is shown with the normal force, the static friction
              force, and the components of the weight . Friction makes the cylinder roll down the plane rather than slip.

             Substituting in from the free-body diagram,

             we can then solve for the linear acceleration of the center of mass from these equations:

             However, it is useful to express the linear acceleration in terms of the moment of inertia. For this, we write
             down Newton's second law for rotation,

             The torques are calculated about the axis through the center of mass of the cylinder. The only nonzero torque
             is provided by the friction force. We have

Finally, the linear acceleration is related to the angular acceleration by

These equations can be used to solve for                in terms of the moment of inertia, where we have

dropped the x-subscript. We rewrite       in terms of the vertical component of gravity and the friction force,

and make the following substitutions.

From this we obtain

Note that this result is independent of the coefficient of static friction,  .
Since we have a solid cylinder, from Figure 10.20, we have                    and

     Therefore, we have                   . Solving for the friction force,
b. Because slipping does not occur,

Substituting this expression into the condition for no slipping, and noting that                  , we have

or

For the solid cylinder, this becomes

Significance

a. The linear acceleration is linearly proportional to  Thus, the greater the angle of the incline, the greater

the linear acceleration, as would be expected. The angular acceleration, however, is linearly proportional to

    and inversely proportional to the radius of the cylinder. Thus, the larger the radius, the smaller the

angular acceleration.

b. For no slipping to occur, the coefficient of static friction must be greater than or equal to  . Thus, the

greater the angle of incline, the greater the coefficient of static friction must be to prevent the cylinder from

slipping.

                                                                                                                                                          11.4

     This is a very useful equation for solving problems involving rolling without slipping. Note that the acceleration is
     less than that of an object sliding down a frictionless plane with no rotation. The acceleration will also be different
     for two rotating objects with different rotational inertias.

     Rolling Motion with Slipping

     In the case of rolling motion with slipping, we must use the coefficient of kinetic friction, which gives rise to the

     kinetic friction force since static friction is not present. The situation is shown in Figure 11.6. In the case of slipping,

     , because point P on the wheel is not at rest on the surface, and                          . Thus,

Significance

We write the linear and angular accelerations in terms of the coefficient of kinetic friction. The linear acceleration is

the same as that found for an object sliding down an inclined plane with kinetic friction. The angular acceleration

about the axis of rotation is linearly proportional to the normal force, which depends on the cosine of the angle of

inclination. As        , this force goes to zero, and, thus, the angular acceleration goes to zero.

Conservation of Mechanical Energy in Rolling Motion

In the preceding chapter, we introduced rotational kinetic energy. Any rolling object carries rotational kinetic energy,
as well as translational kinetic energy and potential energy if the system requires. Including the gravitational
potential energy, the total mechanical energy of an object rolling is

In the absence of any nonconservative forces that would take energy out of the system in the form of heat, the total
energy of a rolling object without slipping is conserved and is constant throughout the motion. Examples where
energy is not conserved are a rolling object that is slipping, production of heat as a result of kinetic friction, and a
rolling object encountering air resistance.

You may ask why a rolling object that is not slipping conserves energy, since the static friction force is
520  11 · Angular Momentum

     nonconservative. The answer can be found by referring back to Figure 11.3. Point P in contact with the surface is at
     rest with respect to the surface. Therefore, its infinitesimal displacement with respect to the surface is zero, and
     the incremental work done by the static friction force is zero. We can apply energy conservation to our study of
     rolling motion to bring out some interesting results.

             EXAMPLE 11.3

     Curiosity Rover

     The Curiosity rover, shown in Figure 11.8, was deployed on Mars on August 6, 2012. The wheels of the rover have a
     radius of 25 cm. Suppose astronauts arrive on Mars in the year 2050 and find the now-inoperative Curiosity on the
     side of a basin. While they are dismantling the rover, an astronaut accidentally loses a grip on one of the wheels,
     which rolls without slipping down into the bottom of the basin 25 meters below. If the wheel has a mass of 5 kg,
     what is its velocity at the bottom of the basin?

     Assembly Facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. (credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)

     Strategy

     We use mechanical energy conservation to analyze the problem. At the top of the hill, the wheel is at rest and has

     only potential energy. At the bottom of the basin, the wheel has rotational and translational kinetic energy, which

     must be equal to the initial potential energy by energy conservation. Since the wheel is rolling without slipping, we

     use the relation       to relate the translational variables to the rotational variables in the energy conservation

     equation. We then solve for the velocity. From Figure 11.8, we see that a hollow cylinder is a good approximation for

     the wheel, so we can use this moment of inertia to simplify the calculation.

     Solution
     Energy at the top of the basin equals energy at the bottom:

The known quantities are                                         .

We rewrite the energy conservation equation eliminating by using    We have

or

On Mars, the acceleration of gravity is  which gives the magnitude of the velocity at the bottom of the
basin as

Significance

This is a fairly accurate result considering that Mars has very little atmosphere, and the loss of energy due to air
resistance would be minimal. The result also assumes that the terrain is smooth, such that the wheel wouldn't
encounter rocks and bumps along the way.

Also, in this example, the kinetic energy, or energy of motion, is equally shared between linear and rotational
motion. If we look at the moments of inertia in Figure 10.20, we see that the hollow cylinder has the largest moment
of inertia for a given radius and mass. If the wheels of the rover were solid and approximated by solid cylinders, for
example, there would be more kinetic energy in linear motion than in rotational motion. This would give the wheel a
larger linear velocity than the hollow cylinder approximation. Thus, the solid cylinder would reach the bottom of the
basin faster than the hollow cylinder.

Why does Earth keep on spinning? What started it spinning to begin with? Why doesn't Earth's gravitational
attraction not bring the Moon crashing in toward Earth? And how does an ice skater manage to spin faster and faster
simply by pulling her arms in? Why does she not have to exert a torque to spin faster?

Questions like these have answers based in angular momentum, the rotational analog to linear momentum. In this
chapter, we first define and then explore angular momentum from a variety of viewpoints. First, however, we
investigate the angular momentum of a single particle. This allows us to develop angular momentum for a system of
particles and for a rigid body that is cylindrically symmetric.

Angular Momentum of a Single Particle

Figure 11.9 shows a particle at a position with linear momentum     with respect to the origin. Even if the

particle is not rotating about the origin, we can still define an angular momentum in terms of the position vector and

the linear momentum.

ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF A PARTICLE

The angular momentum of a particle is defined as the cross-product of and , and is perpendicular to the
522  11 · Angular Momentum

     plane containing and

                                                                                                                  11.5

     FIGURE 11.9 In three-dimensional space, the position vector locates a particle in the xy-plane with linear momentum . The angular

     momentum with respect to the origin is  , which is in the z-direction. The direction of is given by the right-hand rule, as shown.

     The intent of choosing the direction of the angular momentum to be perpendicular to the plane containing and is

     similar to choosing the direction of torque to be perpendicular to the plane of        as discussed in Fixed-Axis

     Rotation. The magnitude of the angular momentum is found from the definition of the cross-product,

     where is the angle between and The units of angular momentum are                 .

     As with the definition of torque, we can define a lever arm that is the perpendicular distance from the momentum

     vector to the origin,                   With this definition, the magnitude of the angular momentum becomes

     We see that if the direction of is such that it passes through the origin, then  and the angular momentum is

     zero because the lever arm is zero. In this respect, the magnitude of the angular momentum depends on the choice

     of origin.

     If we take the time derivative of the angular momentum, we arrive at an expression for the torque on the particle:

     Here we have used the definition of and the fact that a vector crossed into itself is zero. From Newton's second

     law,        the net force acting on the particle, and the definition of the net torque, we can write

                                                                                                                  11.6

     Note the similarity with the linear result of Newton's second law,  . The following problem-solving

     strategy can serve as a guideline for calculating the angular momentum of a particle.

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Angular Momentum of a Particle

  1. Choose a coordinate system about which the angular momentum is to be calculated.
  2. Write down the radius vector to the point particle in unit vector notation.
  3. Write the linear momentum vector of the particle in unit vector notation.

4. Take the cross product         and use the right-hand rule to establish the direction of the angular

momentum vector.

5. See if there is a time dependence in the expression of the angular momentum vector. If there is, then a torque

exists about the origin, and use  to calculate the torque. If there is no time dependence in the

expression for the angular momentum, then the net torque is zero.

EXAMPLE 11.4

Angular Momentum and Torque on a Meteor

A meteor enters Earth's atmosphere (Figure 11.10) and is observed by someone on the ground before it burns up in

the atmosphere. The vector        gives the position of the meteor with respect to the observer. At

the instant the observer sees the meteor, it has linear momentum                       , and it is accelerating at

a constant        along its path, which for our purposes can be taken as a straight line. (a) What is the

angular momentum of the meteor about the origin, which is at the location of the observer? (b) What is the torque on

the meteor about the origin?

            FIGURE 11.10 An observer on the ground sees a meteor at position with linear momentum .

Strategy

We resolve the acceleration into x- and y-components and use the kinematic equations to express the velocity as a
function of acceleration and time. We insert these expressions into the linear momentum and then calculate the
angular momentum using the cross-product. Since the position and momentum vectors are in the xy-plane, we
expect the angular momentum vector to be along the z-axis. To find the torque, we take the time derivative of the
angular momentum.

Solution                                                  below the horizontal, so the components of the

       a. The angular momentum is

            At     , the angular momentum of the meteor about the origin is

          This is the instant that the observer sees the meteor.
     b. To find the torque, we take the time derivative of the angular momentum. Taking the time derivative of as a

          function of time, which is the second equation immediately above, we have

            Then, since               , we have

            The units of torque are given as newton-meters, not to be confused with joules. As a check, we note that the
            lever arm is the x-component of the vector in Figure 11.10 since it is perpendicular to the force acting on the
            meteor, which is along its path. By Newton's second law, this force is

            The lever arm is

            Thus, the torque is

     Significance

     Since the meteor is accelerating downward toward Earth, its radius and velocity vector are changing. Therefore,

     since         , the angular momentum is changing as a function of time. The torque on the meteor about the

     origin, however, is constant, because the lever arm and the force on the meteor are constants. This example is

     important in that it illustrates that the angular momentum depends on the choice of origin about which it is

     calculated. The methods used in this example are also important in developing angular momentum for a system of

     particles and for a rigid body.

Angular Momentum of a System of Particles

The angular momentum of a system of particles is important in many scientific disciplines, one being astronomy.
Consider a spiral galaxy, a rotating island of stars like our own Milky Way. The individual stars can be treated as point
particles, each of which has its own angular momentum. The vector sum of the individual angular momenta give the
total angular momentum of the galaxy. In this section, we develop the tools with which we can calculate the total
angular momentum of a system of particles.

In the preceding section, we introduced the angular momentum of a single particle about a designated origin. The

expression for this angular momentum is  where the vector is from the origin to the particle, and is

the particle's linear momentum. If we have a system of N particles, each with position vector from the origin given

by and each having momentum then the total angular momentum of the system of particles about the origin is

the vector sum of the individual angular momenta about the origin. That is,

                                                                                                    11.7

Similarly, if particle i is subject to a net torque about the origin, then we can find the net torque about the origin
due to the system of particles by differentiating Equation 11.7:

The sum of the individual torques produces a net external torque on the system, which we designate  Thus,
                                                                                                        11.8

Equation 11.8 states that the rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system is equal to the net external
torque acting on the system when both quantities are measured with respect to a given origin. Equation 11.8 can be
applied to any system that has net angular momentum, including rigid bodies, as discussed in the next section.

Angular Momentum of a Rigid Body

We have investigated the angular momentum of a single particle, which we generalized to a system of particles. Now
we can use the principles discussed in the previous section to develop the concept of the angular momentum of a
rigid body. Celestial objects such as planets have angular momentum due to their spin and orbits around stars. In
engineering, anything that rotates about an axis carries angular momentum, such as flywheels, propellers, and
rotating parts in engines. Knowledge of the angular momenta of these objects is crucial to the design of the system
in which they are a part.

To develop the angular momentum of a rigid body, we model a rigid body as being made up of small mass segments,

In Figure 11.12, a rigid body is constrained to rotate about the z-axis with angular velocity . All mass

segments that make up the rigid body undergo circular motion about the z-axis with the same angular velocity. Part

(a) of the figure shows mass segment     with position vector from the origin and radius to the z-axis. The

magnitude of its tangential velocity is  . Because the vectors            are perpendicular to each other, the

magnitude of the angular momentum of this mass segment is

FIGURE 11.12 (a) A rigid body is constrained to rotate around the z-axis. The rigid body is symmetrical about the z-axis. A mass segment
      is located at position which makes angle with respect to the z-axis. The circular motion of an infinitesimal mass segment is

shown. (b) is the angular momentum of the mass segment and has a component along the z-axis  .

Using the right-hand rule, the angular momentum vector points in the direction shown in part (b). The sum of the
angular momenta of all the mass segments contains components both along and perpendicular to the axis of
rotation. Every mass segment has a perpendicular component of the angular momentum that will be cancelled by
the perpendicular component of an identical mass segment on the opposite side of the rigid body, because it is
cylindrically symmetric. Thus, the component along the axis of rotation is the only component that gives a nonzero

value when summed over all the mass segments. From part (b), the component of along the axis of rotation is

The net angular momentum of the rigid body along the axis of rotation is
528  11 · Angular Momentum

     The summation              is simply the moment of inertia I of the rigid body about the axis of rotation. For a thin

     hoop rotating about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the hoop, all of the 's are equal to R so the summation

     reduces to                 which is the moment of inertia for a thin hoop found in Figure 10.20. Thus, the

     magnitude of the angular momentum along the axis of rotation of a rigid body rotating with angular velocity  about
     the axis is                                                                                                  11.9

     This equation is analogous to the magnitude of the linear momentum  . The direction of the angular

     momentum vector is directed along the axis of rotation given by the right-hand rule.

     EXAMPLE 11.6

     Angular Momentum of a Robot Arm

     A robot arm on a Mars rover like Curiosity shown in Figure 11.8 is 1.0 m long and has forceps at the free end to pick

     up rocks. The mass of the arm is 2.0 kg and the mass of the forceps is 1.0 kg. See Figure 11.13. The robot arm and

     forceps move from rest to  in 0.1 s. It rotates down and picks up a Mars rock that has mass 1.5 kg.

     The axis of rotation is the point where the robot arm connects to the rover. (a) What is the angular momentum of the

     robot arm by itself about the axis of rotation after 0.1 s when the arm has stopped accelerating? (b) What is the

     angular momentum of the robot arm when it has the Mars rock in its forceps and is rotating upwards? (c) When the

     arm does not have a rock in the forceps, what is the torque about the point where the arm connects to the rover

     when it is accelerating from rest to its final angular velocity?

        FIGURE 11.13 A robot arm on a Mars rover swings down and picks up a Mars rock. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL-Caltech)

     the right-hand rule gives the angular momentum vector directed out of the page, which we will call the positive
     z-direction. When the arm is rotating upward, the right-hand rule gives the direction of the angular momentum
     vector into the page or in the negative z-direction. The moment of inertia is the sum of the individual moments of
     inertia. The arm can be approximated with a solid rod, and the forceps and Mars rock can be approximated as point
     masses located at a distance of 1 m from the origin. For part (c), we use Newton's second law of motion for rotation
     to find the torque on the robot arm.

     The angular momentum vector is directed out of the page in the direction since the robot arm is rotating
     counterclockwise.
b. We must include the Mars rock in the calculation of the moment of inertia, so we have

and

     Now the angular momentum vector is directed into the page in the direction, by the right-hand rule, since
     the robot arm is now rotating clockwise.
c. We find the torque when the arm does not have the rock by taking the derivative of the angular momentum

using Equation 11.8  But since                    , and understanding that the direction of the angular

momentum and torque vectors are along the axis of rotation, we can suppress the vector notation and find

which is Newton's second law for rotation. Since                          , we can calculate the net torque:

     angular momentum, Equation 11.8. Examples of systems that obey this equation include a freely spinning bicycle
     tire that slows over time due to torque arising from friction, or the slowing of Earth's rotation over millions of years
     due to frictional forces exerted on tidal deformations.

     However, suppose there is no net external torque on the system,  In this case, Equation 11.8 becomes the
     law of conservation of angular momentum.

     LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM

     The angular momentum of a system of particles around a point in a fixed inertial reference frame is conserved if
     there is no net external torque around that point:

                                                                                                                                                   11.10

     or
                                                                                                                                                   11.11

     Note that the total angular momentum is conserved. Any of the individual angular momenta can change as long as
     their sum remains constant. This law is analogous to linear momentum being conserved when the external force on
     a system is zero.

     As an example of conservation of angular momentum, Figure 11.14 shows an ice skater executing a spin. The net
     torque on her is very close to zero because there is relatively little friction between her skates and the ice. Also, the

     friction is exerted very close to the pivot point. Both  are small, so is negligible. Consequently, she can

     spin for quite some time. She can also increase her rate of spin by pulling her arms and legs in. Why does pulling her
     arms and legs in increase her rate of spin? The answer is that her angular momentum is constant, so that

FIGURE 11.14 (a) An ice skater is spinning on the tip of her skate with her arms extended. Her angular momentum is conserved because
the net torque on her is negligibly small. (b) Her rate of spin increases greatly when she pulls in her arms, decreasing her moment of inertia.
The work she does to pull in her arms results in an increase in rotational kinetic energy.

It is interesting to see how the rotational kinetic energy of the skater changes when she pulls her arms in. Her initial
rotational energy is

whereas her final rotational energy is

Since  we can substitute for and find

                                                                     

Because her moment of inertia has decreased,  her final rotational kinetic energy has increased. The source

of this additional rotational kinetic energy is the work required to pull her arms inward. Note that the skater's arms

do not move in a perfect circle--they spiral inward. This work causes an increase in the rotational kinetic energy,

while her angular momentum remains constant. Since she is in a frictionless environment, no energy escapes the

system. Thus, if she were to extend her arms to their original positions, she would rotate at her original angular

velocity and her kinetic energy would return to its original value.

The solar system is another example of how conservation of angular momentum works in our universe. Our solar
system was born from a huge cloud of gas and dust that initially had rotational energy. Gravitational forces caused
the cloud to contract, and the rotation rate increased as a result of conservation of angular momentum (Figure
11.15).

     We continue our discussion with an example that has applications to engineering.

     EXAMPLE 11.7

     Coupled Flywheels

     A flywheel rotates without friction at an angular velocity  on a frictionless, vertical shaft of

     negligible rotational inertia. A second flywheel, which is at rest and has a moment of inertia three times that of the

     rotating flywheel, is dropped onto it (Figure 11.16). Because friction exists between the surfaces, the flywheels very

     quickly reach the same rotational velocity, after which they spin together. (a) Use the law of conservation of angular

Strategy
Part (a) is straightforward to solve for the angular velocity of the coupled system. We use the result of (a) to compare
the initial and final kinetic energies of the system in part (b).

Solution
a. No external torques act on the system. The force due to friction produces an internal torque, which does not
affect the angular momentum of the system. Therefore conservation of angular momentum gives

b. Before contact, only one flywheel is rotating. The rotational kinetic energy of this flywheel is the initial rotational

kinetic energy of the system,  . The final kinetic energy is

Therefore, the ratio of the final kinetic energy to the initial kinetic energy is

Thus, 3/4 of the initial kinetic energy is lost to the coupling of the two flywheels.
Significance
Since the rotational inertia of the system increased, the angular velocity decreased, as expected from the law of
conservation of angular momentum. In this example, we see that the final kinetic energy of the system has
decreased, as energy is lost to the coupling of the flywheels. Compare this to the example of the skater in Figure
11.14 doing work to bring her arms inward and adding rotational kinetic energy.

An 80.0-kg gymnast dismounts from a high bar. He starts the dismount at full extension, then tucks to complete a
number of revolutions before landing. His moment of inertia when fully extended can be approximated as a rod of
length 1.8 m and when in the tuck a rod of half that length. If his rotation rate at full extension is 1.0 rev/s and he
enters the tuck when his center of mass is at 3.0 m height moving horizontally to the floor, how many revolutions
can he execute if he comes out of the tuck at 1.8 m height? See Figure 11.17.
534  11 · Angular Momentum

     FIGURE 11.17 A gymnast dismounts from a high bar and executes a number of revolutions in the tucked position before landing upright.

     Strategy

     Using conservation of angular momentum, we can find his rotation rate when in the tuck. Using the equations of
     kinematics, we can find the time interval from a height of 3.0 m to 1.8 m. Since he is moving horizontally with
     respect to the ground, the equations of free fall simplify. This will allow the number of revolutions that can be
     executed to be calculated. Since we are using a ratio, we can keep the units as rev/s and don't need to convert to
     radians/s.

     Solution

     The moment of inertia at full extension is                             .

     The moment of inertia in the tuck is                                .

     Note that the number of revolutions he can complete will depend on how long he is in the air. In the problem, he is
     exiting the high bar horizontally to the ground. He could also exit at an angle with respect to the ground, giving him
     more or less time in the air depending on the angle, positive or negative, with respect to the ground. Gymnasts must
     take this into account when they are executing their dismounts.

FIGURE 11.18 A bullet is fired horizontally and becomes embedded in the edge of a disk that is free to rotate about its vertical axis.

Strategy

For the system of the bullet and the cylinder, no external torque acts along the vertical axis through the center of the

disk. Thus, the angular momentum along this axis is conserved. The initial angular momentum of the bullet is                            ,

which is taken about the rotational axis of the disk the moment before the collision. The initial angular momentum of

the cylinder is zero. Thus, the net angular momentum of the system is  . Since angular momentum is conserved,

the initial angular momentum of the system is equal to the angular momentum of the bullet embedded in the disk

immediately after impact.

Solution
The initial angular momentum of the system is

The moment of inertia of the system with the bullet embedded in the disk is

The final angular momentum of the system is

The system is composed of both a point particle and a rigid body. Care must be taken when formulating the angular

11.4 Precession of a Gyroscope

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe the physical processes underlying the phenomenon of precession
    · Calculate the precessional angular velocity of a gyroscope

Figure 11.19 shows a gyroscope, defined as a spinning disk in which the axis of rotation is free to assume any
orientation. When spinning, the orientation of the spin axis is unaffected by the orientation of the body that encloses
536  11 · Angular Momentum

     it. The body or vehicle enclosing the gyroscope can be moved from place to place and the orientation of the spin axis
     will remain the same. This makes gyroscopes very useful in navigation, especially where magnetic compasses can't
     be used, such as in piloted and unpiloted spacecrafts, intercontinental ballistic missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles,
     and satellites like the Hubble Space Telescope.

                           FIGURE 11.19 A gyroscope consists of a spinning disk about an axis that is free to assume any orientation.

     We illustrate the precession of a gyroscope with an example of a top in the next two figures. If the top is placed on a
     flat surface near the surface of Earth at an angle to the vertical and is not spinning, it will fall over, due to the force of
     gravity producing a torque acting on its center of mass. This is shown in Figure 11.20(a). However, if the top is
     spinning on its axis, rather than topple over due to this torque, it precesses about the vertical, shown in part (b) of
     the figure. This is due to the torque on the center of mass, which provides the change in angular momentum.

     FIGURE 11.20 (a) If the top is not spinning, there is a torque  about the origin, and the top falls over. (b) If the top is spinning about

     its axis  it doesn't fall over but precesses about the z-axis.

     Figure 11.21 shows the forces acting on a spinning top. The torque produced is perpendicular to the angular

     momentum vector. This changes the direction of the angular momentum vector according to  but not its

     magnitude. The top precesses around a vertical axis, since the torque is always horizontal and perpendicular to . If
     the top is not spinning, it acquires angular momentum in the direction of the torque, and it rotates around a
     horizontal axis, falling over just as we would expect.

FIGURE 11.21 The force of gravity acting on the center of mass produces a torque in the direction perpendicular to  The magnitude of

We can experience this phenomenon first hand by holding a spinning bicycle wheel and trying to rotate it about an
axis perpendicular to the spin axis. As shown in Figure 11.22, the person applies forces perpendicular to the spin
axis in an attempt to rotate the wheel, but instead, the wheel axis starts to change direction to her left due to the
applied torque.

FIGURE 11.22 (a) A person holding the spinning bike wheel lifts it with her right hand and pushes down with her left hand in an attempt to

rotate the wheel. This action creates a torque directly toward her. This torque causes a change in angular momentum in exactly the

same direction. (b) A vector diagram depicting how  add, producing a new angular momentum pointing more toward the person.
538  11 · Angular Momentum

     The wheel moves toward the person, perpendicular to the forces she exerts on it.

     We all know how easy it is for a bicycle to tip over when sitting on it at rest. But when riding the bicycle at a good
     pace, tipping it over involves changing the angular momentum vector of the spinning wheels.

          INTERACTIVE

     View the video on gyroscope precession (https://openstax.org/l/21gyrovideo) for a complete demonstration of
     precession of the bicycle wheel.

     Also, when a spinning disk is put in a box such as a Blu-Ray player, try to move it. It is easy to translate the box in a
     given direction but difficult to rotate it about an axis perpendicular to the axis of the spinning disk, since we are
     putting a torque on the box that will cause the angular momentum vector of the spinning disk to precess.
     We can calculate the precession rate of the top in Figure 11.21. From Figure 11.21, we see that the magnitude of
     the torque is

     Thus,

     The angle the top precesses through in time dt is

     The precession angular velocity is   and from this equation we see that

                                                                              11.12

     In this derivation, we assumed that  that is, that the precession angular velocity is much less than the

     angular velocity of the gyroscope disk. The precession angular velocity adds a small component to the angular

     momentum along the z-axis. This is seen in a slight bob up and down as the gyroscope precesses, referred to as

     nutation.

     Earth itself acts like a gigantic gyroscope. Its angular momentum is along its axis and currently points at Polaris, the
     North Star. But Earth is slowly precessing (once in about 26,000 years) due to the torque of the Sun and the Moon
     on its nonspherical shape.

             EXAMPLE 11.10

     Period of Precession

     A gyroscope spins with its tip on the ground and is spinning with negligible frictional resistance. The disk of the

     the disk is 5.0 cm. What is the precessional period of the gyroscope?

     Strategy
     We use Equation 11.12 to find the precessional angular velocity of the gyroscope. This allows us to find the period of
     precession.

The angular velocity of the disk is

We can now substitute in Equation 11.12. The precessional angular velocity is

Significance
The precessional angular frequency of the gyroscope, 3.12 rad/s, or about 0.5 rev/s, is much less than the angular
velocity 20 rev/s of the gyroscope disk. Therefore, we don't expect a large component of the angular momentum to
arise due to precession, and Equation 11.12 is a good approximation of the precessional angular velocity.

INTRODUCTION In earlier chapters, you learned about forces and Newton's laws for translational motion. You then
studied torques and the rotational motion of a body about a fixed axis of rotation. You also learned that static
equilibrium means no motion at all and that dynamic equilibrium means motion without acceleration.
In this chapter, we combine the conditions for static translational equilibrium and static rotational equilibrium to
describe situations typical for any kind of construction. What type of cable will support a suspension bridge? What
type of foundation will support an office building? Will this prosthetic arm function correctly? These are examples of
questions that contemporary engineers must be able to answer.
The elastic properties of materials are especially important in engineering applications, including bioengineering.
For example, materials that can stretch or compress and then return to their original form or position make good
shock absorbers. In this chapter, you will learn about some applications that combine equilibrium with elasticity to
construct real structures that last.

     12.1 Conditions for Static Equilibrium

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the physical conditions of static equilibrium.
         · Draw a free-body diagram for a rigid body acted on by forces.
         · Explain how the conditions for equilibrium allow us to solve statics problems.

     We say that a rigid body is in equilibrium when both its linear and angular acceleration are zero relative to an inertial
     frame of reference. This means that a body in equilibrium can be moving, but if so, its linear and angular velocities
     must be constant. We say that a rigid body is in static equilibrium when it is at rest in our selected frame of
     reference. Notice that the distinction between the state of rest and a state of uniform motion is artificial--that is, an
     object may be at rest in our selected frame of reference, yet to an observer moving at constant velocity relative to
     our frame, the same object appears to be in uniform motion with constant velocity. Because the motion is relative,
     what is in static equilibrium to us is in dynamic equilibrium to the moving observer, and vice versa. Since the laws of
     physics are identical for all inertial reference frames, in an inertial frame of reference, there is no distinction
     between static equilibrium and equilibrium.

     According to Newton's second law of motion, the linear acceleration of a rigid body is caused by a net force acting on
     it, or

                                                                                                                                                          12.1

     Here, the sum is of all external forces acting on the body, where m is its mass and  is the linear acceleration of

     its center of mass (a concept we discussed in Linear Momentum and Collisions on linear momentum and collisions).

     In equilibrium, the linear acceleration is zero. If we set the acceleration to zero in Equation 12.1, we obtain the

     following equation:

     FIRST EQUILIBRIUM CONDITION

     The first equilibrium condition for the static equilibrium of a rigid body expresses translational equilibrium:
                                                                                                                                                     12.2

     The first equilibrium condition, Equation 12.2, is the equilibrium condition for forces, which we encountered when
     studying applications of Newton's laws.

     This vector equation is equivalent to the following three scalar equations for the components of the net force:
                                                                                                                                                          12.3

     Analogously to Equation 12.1, we can state that the rotational acceleration  of a rigid body about a fixed axis of
     rotation is caused by the net torque acting on the body, or                                                              12.4

     Here is the rotational inertia of the body in rotation about this axis and the summation is over all torques of
     external forces in Equation 12.2. In equilibrium, the rotational acceleration is zero. By setting to zero the right-hand
     side of Equation 12.4, we obtain the second equilibrium condition:

       SECOND EQUILIBRIUM CONDITION

       The second equilibrium condition for the static equilibrium of a rigid body expresses rotational equilibrium:

                                                       12.1 · Conditions for Static Equilibrium                                                            553

                                                                                                      12.5

The second equilibrium condition, Equation 12.5, is the equilibrium condition for torques that we encountered when
we studied rotational dynamics. It is worth noting that this equation for equilibrium is generally valid for rotational
equilibrium about any axis of rotation (fixed or otherwise). Again, this vector equation is equivalent to three scalar
equations for the vector components of the net torque:

                                                                                                                                                     12.6

The second equilibrium condition means that in equilibrium, there is no net external torque to cause rotation about
any axis.

The first and second equilibrium conditions are stated in a particular reference frame. The first condition involves
only forces and is therefore independent of the origin of the reference frame. However, the second condition

involves torque, which is defined as a cross product,  where the position vector with respect to

the axis of rotation of the point where the force is applied enters the equation. Therefore, torque depends on the

location of the axis in the reference frame. However, when rotational and translational equilibrium conditions hold

simultaneously in one frame of reference, then they also hold in any other inertial frame of reference, so that the net

torque about any axis of rotation is still zero. The explanation for this is fairly straightforward.

Suppose vector is the position of the origin of a new inertial frame of reference in the old inertial frame of
reference S. From our study of relative motion, we know that in the new frame of reference the position vector

     of the point where the force is applied is related to via the equation

Now, we can sum all torques  of all external forces in a new reference frame,

In the final step in this chain of reasoning, we used the fact that in equilibrium in the old frame of reference, S, the
first term vanishes because of Equation 12.5 and the second term vanishes because of Equation 12.2. Hence, we
see that the net torque in any inertial frame of reference is zero, provided that both conditions for equilibrium
hold in an inertial frame of reference S.

The practical implication of this is that when applying equilibrium conditions for a rigid body, we are free to choose
any point as the origin of the reference frame. Our choice of reference frame is dictated by the physical specifics of
the problem we are solving. In one frame of reference, the mathematical form of the equilibrium conditions may be
quite complicated, whereas in another frame, the same conditions may have a simpler mathematical form that is
easy to solve. The origin of a selected frame of reference is called the pivot point.

In the most general case, equilibrium conditions are expressed by the six scalar equations (Equation 12.3 and
Equation 12.6). For planar equilibrium problems with rotation about a fixed axis, which we consider in this chapter,
we can reduce the number of equations to three. The standard procedure is to adopt a frame of reference where the
z-axis is the axis of rotation. With this choice of axis, the net torque has only a z-component, all forces that have
non-zero torques lie in the xy-plane, and therefore contributions to the net torque come from only the x- and
y-components of external forces. Thus, for planar problems with the axis of rotation perpendicular to the xy-plane,
we have the following three equilibrium conditions for forces and torques:

                                                                                                                                                     12.7

                                                                                                                                                     12.8

                                                                                                                                                     12.9

where the summation is over all N external forces acting on the body and over their torques. In Equation 12.9, we

     simplified the notation by dropping the subscript z, but we understand here that the summation is over all  from the
     contributions along the z-axis, which is the axis of rotation. In Equation 12.9, the z-component of torque   12.10
     force is

     where is the length of the lever arm of the force and is the magnitude of the force (as you saw in Fixed-Axis

     Rotation). The angle is the angle between vectors and measuring from vector to vector in the
     counterclockwise direction (Figure 12.2). When using Equation 12.10, we often compute the magnitude of torque
     and assign its sense as either positive or negative depending on the direction of rotation caused by this
     torque alone. In Equation 12.9, net torque is the sum of terms, with each term computed from Equation 12.10, and
     each term must have the correct sense. Similarly, in Equation 12.7, we assign the sign to force components in the

        x-direction and the sign to components in the x-direction. The same rule must be consistently followed in
     Equation 12.8, when computing force components along the y-axis.

     FIGURE 12.2 Torque of a force: (a) When the torque of a force causes counterclockwise rotation about the axis of rotation, we say that its
     sense is positive, which means the torque vector is parallel to the axis of rotation. (b) When torque of a force causes clockwise rotation
     about the axis, we say that its sense is negative, which means the torque vector is antiparallel to the axis of rotation.

     vector is attached to the center of gravity of the body. For all practical purposes, the center of gravity is identical to

     the center of mass, as you learned in Linear Momentum and Collisions on linear momentum and collisions. Only in

     situations where a body has a large spatial extension so that the gravitational field is nonuniform throughout its

     volume, are the center of gravity and the center of mass located at different points. In practical situations, however,

     even objects as large as buildings or cruise ships are located in a uniform gravitational field on Earth's surface,

     where the acceleration due to gravity has a constant magnitude of  In these situations, the center of

     gravity is identical to the center of mass. Therefore, throughout this chapter, we use the center of mass (CM) as the

     point where the weight vector is attached. Recall that the CM has a special physical meaning: When an external

     force is applied to a body at exactly its CM, the body as a whole undergoes translational motion and such a force

     does not cause rotation.

     When the CM is located off the axis of rotation, a net gravitational torque occurs on an object. Gravitational torque
     is the torque caused by weight. This gravitational torque may rotate the object if there is no support present to

balance it. The magnitude of the gravitational torque depends on how far away from the pivot the CM is located. For
example, in the case of a tipping truck (Figure 12.3), the pivot is located on the line where the tires make contact
with the road's surface. If the CM is located high above the road's surface, the gravitational torque may be large
enough to turn the truck over. Passenger cars with a low-lying CM, close to the pavement, are more resistant to
tipping over than are trucks.

FIGURE 12.3 The distribution of mass affects the position of the center of mass (CM), where the weight vector is attached. If the center
of gravity is within the area of support, the truck returns to its initial position after tipping [see the left panel in (b)]. But if the center of
gravity lies outside the area of support, the truck turns over [see the right panel in (b)]. Both vehicles in (b) are out of equilibrium. Notice
that the car in (a) is in equilibrium: The low location of its center of gravity makes it hard to tip over.

     INTERACTIVE

If you tilt a box so that one edge remains in contact with the table beneath it, then one edge of the base of support
becomes a pivot. As long as the center of gravity of the box remains over the base of support, gravitational torque
rotates the box back toward its original position of stable equilibrium. When the center of gravity moves outside of
the base of support, gravitational torque rotates the box in the opposite direction, and the box rolls over. View this
demonstration (https://openstax.org/l/21unstable) to experiment with stable and unstable positions of a box.

Center of Gravity of a Car

A passenger car with a 2.5-m wheelbase has 52% of its weight on the front wheels on level ground, as illustrated in
Figure 12.4. Where is the CM of this car located with respect to the rear axle?

     Strategy

     We do not know the weight w of the car. All we know is that when the car rests on a level surface, 0.52w pushes

     down on the surface at contact points of the front wheels and 0.48w pushes down on the surface at contact points

     of the rear wheels. Also, the contact points are separated from each other by the distance         At these

     contact points, the car experiences normal reaction forces with magnitudes  and                    on the

     front and rear axles, respectively. We also know that the car is an example of a rigid body in equilibrium whose

     entire weight w acts at its CM. The CM is located somewhere between the points where the normal reaction forces

     act, somewhere at a distance x from the point where acts. Our task is to find x. Thus, we identify three forces

     acting on the body (the car), and we can draw a free-body diagram for the extended rigid body, as shown in Figure

     12.5.

     FIGURE 12.5 The free-body diagram for the car clearly indicates force vectors acting on the car and distances to the center of mass (CM).
     When CM is selected as the pivot point, these distances are lever arms of normal reaction forces. Notice that vector magnitudes and lever
     arms do not need to be drawn to scale, but all quantities of relevance must be clearly labeled.

     We are almost ready to write down equilibrium conditions Equation 12.7 through Equation 12.9 for the car, but first
     we must decide on the reference frame. Suppose we choose the x-axis along the length of the car, the y-axis
     vertical, and the z-axis perpendicular to this xy-plane. With this choice we only need to write Equation 12.7 and
     Equation 12.9 because all the y-components are identically zero. Now we need to decide on the location of the pivot
     point. We can choose any point as the location of the axis of rotation (z-axis). Suppose we place the axis of rotation
     at CM, as indicated in the free-body diagram for the car. At this point, we are ready to write the equilibrium
     conditions for the car.

where is the torque of force       is the gravitational torque of force w, and is the torque of force When

the pivot is located at CM, the gravitational torque is identically zero because the lever arm of the weight with

respect to an axis that passes through CM is zero. The lines of action of both normal reaction forces are

perpendicular to their lever arms, so in Equation 12.10, we have          for both forces. From the free-body

diagram, we read that torque causes clockwise rotation about the pivot at CM, so its sense is negative; and

torque causes counterclockwise rotation about the pivot at CM, so its sense is positive. With this information, we

write the second equilibrium condition as

                                                                                                           12.13

With the help of the free-body diagram, we identify the force magnitudes  and                              and their

corresponding lever arms      and          We can now write the second equilibrium condition, Equation

12.13, explicitly in terms of the unknown distance x:

                                                                                                           12.14

Here the weight w cancels and we can solve the equation for the unknown position x of the CM. The answer is

Solution

Choosing the pivot at the position of the front axle does not change the result. The free-body diagram for this pivot
location is presented in Figure 12.6. For this choice of pivot point, the second equilibrium condition is

                                                                                                                                                   12.15

When we substitute the quantities indicated in the diagram, we obtain

                                                                                                           12.16

The answer obtained by solving Equation 12.13 is, again,

This example shows that when solving static equilibrium problems, we are free to choose the pivot location. For
different choices of the pivot point we have different sets of equilibrium conditions to solve. However, all choices
lead to the same solution to the problem.

558  12 · Static Equilibrium and Elasticity

     A special case of static equilibrium occurs when all external forces on an object act at or along the axis of rotation or
     when the spatial extension of the object can be disregarded. In such a case, the object can be effectively treated like
     a point mass. In this special case, we need not worry about the second equilibrium condition, Equation 12.9,
     because all torques are identically zero and the first equilibrium condition (for forces) is the only condition to be
     satisfied. The free-body diagram and problem-solving strategy for this special case were outlined in Newton's Laws
     of Motion and Applications of Newton's Laws. You will see a typical equilibrium situation involving only the first
     equilibrium condition in the next example.

     position of the knot and, at the same time, see the vector-diagram representation of the first equilibrium condition
     at work.

             EXAMPLE 12.2

     A Breaking Tension

     A small pan of mass 42.0 g is supported by two strings, as shown in Figure 12.7. The maximum tension that the
     string can support is 2.80 N. Mass is added gradually to the pan until one of the strings snaps. Which string is it?
     How much mass must be added for this to occur?

                                              FIGURE 12.7 Mass is added gradually to the pan until one of the strings snaps.

     Strategy
     This mechanical system consisting of strings, masses, and the pan is in static equilibrium. Specifically, the knot that
     ties the strings to the pan is in static equilibrium. The knot can be treated as a point; therefore, we need only the first
     equilibrium condition. The three forces pulling at the knot are the tension in the 5.0-cm string, the tension in
     the 10.0-cm string, and the weight of the pan holding the masses. We adopt a rectangular coordinate system with
     the y-axis pointing opposite to the direction of gravity and draw the free-body diagram for the knot (see Figure
     12.8). To find the tension components, we must identify the direction angles and that the strings make with
     the horizontal direction that is the x-axis. As you can see in Figure 12.7, the strings make two sides of a right
     triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this triangle, shown in Figure 12.8, and find the sine and
     cosine of the angles and Then we can resolve the tensions into their rectangular components, substitute in
     the first condition for equilibrium (Equation 12.7 and Equation 12.8), and solve for the tensions in the strings. The
     string with a greater tension will break first.

Solution
The weight w pulling on the knot is due to the mass M of the pan and mass m added to the pan, or
With the help of the free-body diagram in Figure 12.8, we can set up the equilibrium conditions for the knot:

From the free-body diagram, the magnitudes of components in these equations are

We substitute these components into the equilibrium conditions and simplify. We then obtain two equilibrium
equations for the tensions:

The equilibrium equation for the x-direction tells us that the tension in the 5.0-cm string is twice the tension
in the 10.0-cm string. Therefore, the shorter string will snap. When we use the first equation to eliminate from
the second equation, we obtain the relation between the mass on the pan and the tension in the shorter string:

The string breaks when the tension reaches the critical value of  The preceding equation can be solved

     Suppose that the mechanical system considered in this example is attached to a ceiling inside an elevator going up.
     As long as the elevator moves up at a constant speed, the result stays the same because the weight does not

     becomes larger by an apparent weight due to the acceleration of the elevator. Still, in all cases the shorter string
     breaks first.

     12.2 Examples of Static Equilibrium

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify and analyze static equilibrium situations
         · Set up a free-body diagram for an extended object in static equilibrium
         · Set up and solve static equilibrium conditions for objects in equilibrium in various physical situations

     All examples in this chapter are planar problems. Accordingly, we use equilibrium conditions in the component form
     of Equation 12.7 to Equation 12.9. We introduced a problem-solving strategy in Example 12.1 to illustrate the
     physical meaning of the equilibrium conditions. Now we generalize this strategy in a list of steps to follow when
     solving static equilibrium problems for extended rigid bodies. We proceed in five practical steps.

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Static Equilibrium

       1. Identify the object to be analyzed. For some systems in equilibrium, it may be necessary to consider more
             than one object. Identify all forces acting on the object. Identify the questions you need to answer. Identify
             the information given in the problem. In realistic problems, some key information may be implicit in the
             situation rather than provided explicitly.

       2. Set up a free-body diagram for the object. (a) Choose the xy-reference frame for the problem. Draw a free-
             body diagram for the object, including only the forces that act on it. When suitable, represent the forces in
             terms of their components in the chosen reference frame. As you do this for each force, cross out the original
             force so that you do not erroneously include the same force twice in equations. Label all forces--you will need
            this for correct computations of net forces in the x- and y-directions. For an unknown force, the direction must
             be assigned arbitrarily; think of it as a `working direction' or `suspected direction.' The correct direction is
             determined by the sign that you obtain in the final solution. A plus sign means that the working direction is
             the actual direction. A minus sign means that the actual direction is opposite to the assumed working
             direction. (b) Choose the location of the rotation axis; in other words, choose the pivot point with respect to
             which you will compute torques of acting forces. On the free-body diagram, indicate the location of the pivot
             and the lever arms of acting forces--you will need this for correct computations of torques. In the selection of
             the pivot, keep in mind that the pivot can be placed anywhere you wish, but the guiding principle is that the
             best choice will simplify as much as possible the calculation of the net torque along the rotation axis.

       3. Set up the equations of equilibrium for the object. (a) Use the free-body diagram to write a correct equilibrium
            condition Equation 12.7 for force components in the x-direction. (b) Use the free-body diagram to write a
            correct equilibrium condition Equation 12.11 for force components in the y-direction. (c) Use the free-body
             diagram to write a correct equilibrium condition Equation 12.9 for torques along the axis of rotation. Use
             Equation 12.10 to evaluate torque magnitudes and senses.

       4. Simplify and solve the system of equations for equilibrium to obtain unknown quantities. At this point, your
             work involves algebra only. Keep in mind that the number of equations must be the same as the number of
             unknowns. If the number of unknowns is larger than the number of equations, the problem cannot be solved.

       5. Evaluate the expressions for the unknown quantities that you obtained in your solution. Your final answers

should have correct numerical values and correct physical units. If they do not, then use the previous steps to
track back a mistake to its origin and correct it. Also, you may independently check for your numerical answers
by shifting the pivot to a different location and solving the problem again, which is what we did in Example
12.1.

Note that setting up a free-body diagram for a rigid-body equilibrium problem is the most important component in
the solution process. Without the correct setup and a correct diagram, you will not be able to write down correct
conditions for equilibrium. Also note that a free-body diagram for an extended rigid body that may undergo
rotational motion is different from a free-body diagram for a body that experiences only translational motion (as you
saw in the chapters on Newton's laws of motion). In translational dynamics, a body is represented as its CM, where
all forces on the body are attached and no torques appear. This does not hold true in rotational dynamics, where an
extended rigid body cannot be represented by one point alone. The reason for this is that in analyzing rotation, we
must identify torques acting on the body, and torque depends both on the acting force and on its lever arm. Here,
the free-body diagram for an extended rigid body helps us identify external torques.

EXAMPLE 12.3

The Torque Balance

Three masses are attached to a uniform meter stick, as shown in Figure 12.9. The mass of the meter stick is 150.0 g

and the masses to the left of the fulcrum are         and             Find the mass that balances the

system when it is attached at the right end of the stick, and the normal reaction force at the fulcrum when the

system is balanced.

FIGURE 12.9 In a torque balance, a horizontal beam is supported at a fulcrum (indicated by S) and masses are attached to both sides of the
fulcrum. The system is in static equilibrium when the beam does not rotate. It is balanced when the beam remains level.

Strategy
For the arrangement shown in the figure, we identify the following five forces acting on the meter stick:

is the weight of mass                          is the weight of mass

is the weight of the entire meter stick;              is the weight of unknown mass

is the normal reaction force at the support point S.

We choose a frame of reference where the direction of the y-axis is the direction of gravity, the direction of the x-axis
is along the meter stick, and the axis of rotation (the z-axis) is perpendicular to the x-axis and passes through the
support point S. In other words, we choose the pivot at the point where the meter stick touches the support. This is
a natural choice for the pivot because this point does not move as the stick rotates. Now we are ready to set up the
free-body diagram for the meter stick. We indicate the pivot and attach five vectors representing the five forces
along the line representing the meter stick, locating the forces with respect to the pivot Figure 12.10. At this stage,
we can identify the lever arms of the five forces given the information provided in the problem. For the three hanging
masses, the problem is explicit about their locations along the stick, but the information about the location of the
weight w is given implicitly. The key word here is "uniform." We know from our previous studies that the CM of a
uniform stick is located at its midpoint, so this is where we attach the weight w, at the 50-cm mark.

     Solution
     With Figure 12.9 and Figure 12.10 for reference, we begin by finding the lever arms of the five forces acting on the
     stick:

     Now we can find the five torques with respect to the chosen pivot:

     The second equilibrium condition (equation for the torques) for the meter stick is

     When substituting torque values into this equation, we can omit the torques giving zero contributions. In this way
     the second equilibrium condition is

                                                                                                                                                        12.17

     Selecting the -direction to be parallel to the first equilibrium condition for the stick is

                          12.19

To find the normal reaction force, we rearrange the terms in Equation 12.18, converting grams to kilograms:
                                                                                                                                                   12.20

Significance

Notice that Equation 12.17 is independent of the value of g. The torque balance may therefore be used to measure
mass, since variations in g-values on Earth's surface do not affect these measurements. This is not the case for a
spring balance because it measures the force.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 12.3

Repeat Example 12.3 using the left end of the meter stick to calculate the torques; that is, by placing the pivot at the
left end of the meter stick.

In the next example, we show how to use the first equilibrium condition (equation for forces) in the vector form
given by Equation 12.7 and Equation 12.8. We present this solution to illustrate the importance of a suitable choice
of reference frame. Although all inertial reference frames are equivalent and numerical solutions obtained in one
frame are the same as in any other, an unsuitable choice of reference frame can make the solution quite lengthy and
convoluted, whereas a wise choice of reference frame makes the solution straightforward. We show this in the
equivalent solution to the same problem. This particular example illustrates an application of static equilibrium to
biomechanics.

     We identify three forces acting on the forearm: the unknown force at the elbow; the unknown tension in the

     muscle; and the weight with magnitude                  We adopt the frame of reference with the x-axis along the

     forearm and the pivot at the elbow. The vertical direction is the direction of the weight, which is the same as the

     direction of the upper arm. The x-axis makes an angle  with the vertical. The y-axis is perpendicular to the

     x-axis. Now we set up the free-body diagram for the forearm. First, we draw the axes, the pivot, and the three

     vectors representing the three identified forces. Then we locate the angle and represent each force by its x- and

     y-components, remembering to cross out the original force vector to avoid double counting. Finally, we label the

     forces and their lever arms. The free-body diagram for the forearm is shown in Figure 12.12. At this point, we are

     ready to set up equilibrium conditions for the forearm. Each force has x- and y-components; therefore, we have two

     equations for the first equilibrium condition, one equation for each component of the net force acting on the

     forearm.

               FIGURE 12.12 Free-body diagram for the forearm: The pivot is located at point E (elbow).

     Notice that in our frame of reference, contributions to the second equilibrium condition (for torques) come only from

     the y-components of the forces because the x-components of the forces are all parallel to their lever arms, so that

     for any of them we have                 in Equation 12.10. For the y-components we have  in Equation 12.10.

     Also notice that the torque of the force at the elbow is zero because this force is attached at the pivot. So the

     contribution to the net torque comes only from the torques of and of

     Solution
     We see from the free-body diagram that the x-component of the net force satisfies the equation

and the y-component of the net force satisfies

                                                                                                           12.22

Equation 12.21 and Equation 12.22 are two equations of the first equilibrium condition (for forces). Next, we read
from the free-body diagram that the net torque along the axis of rotation is

                                                                                                                                                   12.23

Equation 12.23 is the second equilibrium condition (for torques) for the forearm. The free-body diagram shows that

the lever arms are  and                           At this point, we do not need to convert inches into SI units,

because as long as these units are consistent in Equation 12.23, they cancel out. Using the free-body diagram again,

we find the magnitudes of the component forces:

We substitute these magnitudes into Equation 12.21, Equation 12.22, and Equation 12.23 to obtain, respectively,

When we simplify these equations, we see that we are left with only two independent equations for the two

unknown force magnitudes, F and T, because Equation 12.21 for the x-component is equivalent to Equation 12.22

for the y-component. In this way, we obtain the first equilibrium condition for forces

                                                                                                           12.24

The magnitude of tension in the muscle is obtained by solving Equation 12.25:

The force at the elbow is obtained by solving Equation 12.24:

The negative sign in the equation tells us that the actual force at the elbow is antiparallel to the working direction
adopted for drawing the free-body diagram. In the final answer, we convert the forces into SI units of force. The
answer is

Significance
Two important issues here are worth noting. The first concerns conversion into SI units, which can be done at the
very end of the solution as long as we keep consistency in units. The second important issue concerns the hinge
566  12 · Static Equilibrium and Elasticity

     joints such as the elbow. In the initial analysis of a problem, hinge joints should always be assumed to exert a force
     in an arbitrary direction, and then you must solve for all components of a hinge force independently. In this example,
     the elbow force happens to be vertical because the problem assumes the tension by the biceps to be vertical as
     well. Such a simplification, however, is not a general rule.

     Solution

     Suppose we adopt a reference frame with the direction of the y-axis along the 50-lb weight and the pivot placed at
     the elbow. In this frame, all three forces have only y-components, so we have only one equation for the first
     equilibrium condition (for forces). We draw the free-body diagram for the forearm as shown in Figure 12.13,
     indicating the pivot, the acting forces and their lever arms with respect to the pivot, and the angles and that

     the forces and (respectively) make with their lever arms. In the definition of torque given by Equation 12.10,
     the angle is the direction angle of the vector counted counterclockwise from the radial direction of the lever
     arm that always points away from the pivot. By the same convention, the angle is measured counterclockwise
     from the radial direction of the lever arm to the vector Done this way, the non-zero torques are most easily
     computed by directly substituting into Equation 12.10 as follows:

     FIGURE 12.13 Free-body diagram for the forearm for the equivalent solution. The pivot is located at point E (elbow).

     The second equilibrium condition,       can be now written as

                                                                                                                           12.26

     From the free-body diagram, the first equilibrium condition (for forces) is                                           12.27
     Equation 12.26 is identical to Equation 12.25 and gives the result
                                                                                  Equation 12.27 gives

     We see that these answers are identical to our previous answers, but the second choice for the frame of reference
     leads to an equivalent solution that is simpler and quicker because it does not require that the forces be resolved
     into their rectangular components.

    EXAMPLE 12.5

A Ladder Resting Against a Wall

A uniform ladder is  long and weighs 400.0 N. The ladder rests against a slippery vertical wall, as shown

in Figure 12.14. The minimum inclination angle between the ladder and the rough floor below which the ladder slips

is        Find the reaction forces from the floor and from the wall on the ladder and the coefficient of static

friction at the interface of the ladder with the floor that prevents the ladder from slipping.

                     FIGURE 12.14 A 5.0-m-long ladder rests against a frictionless wall.

Strategy

We can identify four forces acting on the ladder. The first force is the normal reaction force N from the floor in the

upward vertical direction. The second force is the static friction force  directed horizontally along the floor

toward the wall--this force prevents the ladder from slipping. These two forces act on the ladder at its contact point

with the floor. The third force is the weight w of the ladder, attached at its CM located midway between its ends. The

fourth force is the normal reaction force F from the wall in the horizontal direction away from the wall, attached at

the contact point with the wall. There are no other forces because the wall is slippery, which means there is no

friction between the wall and the ladder. Based on this analysis, we adopt the frame of reference with the y-axis in

the vertical direction (parallel to the wall) and the x-axis in the horizontal direction (parallel to the floor). In this

frame, each force has either a horizontal component or a vertical component but not both, which simplifies the

solution. We select the pivot at the contact point with the floor. In the free-body diagram for the ladder, we indicate

the pivot, all four forces and their lever arms, and the angles between lever arms and the forces, as shown in Figure

12.15. With our choice of the pivot location, there is no torque either from the normal reaction force N or from the

static friction f because they both act at the pivot.

     where is the torque of the weight w and is the torque of the reaction F. From the free-body diagram, we

     identify that the lever arm of the reaction at the wall is        and the lever arm of the weight is

               With the help of the free-body diagram, we identify the angles to be used in Equation 12.10 for

     torques:  for the torque from the reaction force with the wall, and                                                       for the

     torque due to the weight. Now we are ready to use Equation 12.10 to compute torques:

     We substitute the torques into Equation 12.30 and solve for

                                                                                                                               12.31

Its magnitude is

and its direction is

We should emphasize here two general observations of practical use. First, notice that when we choose a pivot
point, there is no expectation that the system will actually pivot around the chosen point. The ladder in this example
is not rotating at all but firmly stands on the floor; nonetheless, its contact point with the floor is a good choice for
the pivot. Second, notice when we use Equation 12.10 for the computation of individual torques, we do not need to
resolve the forces into their normal and parallel components with respect to the direction of the lever arm, and we
do not need to consider a sense of the torque. As long as the angle in Equation 12.10 is correctly identified--with the
help of a free-body diagram--as the angle measured counterclockwise from the direction of the lever arm to the
direction of the force vector, Equation 12.10 gives both the magnitude and the sense of the torque. This is because
torque is the vector product of the lever-arm vector crossed with the force vector, and Equation 12.10 expresses the
rectangular component of this vector product along the axis of rotation.

Significance

This result is independent of the length of the ladder because L is cancelled in the second equilibrium condition,
Equation 12.31. No matter how long or short the ladder is, as long as its weight is 400 N and the angle with the floor
is our results hold. But the ladder will slip if the net torque becomes negative in Equation 12.31. This happens
for some angles when the coefficient of static friction is not great enough to prevent the ladder from slipping.

     Strategy

     The forces that the door exerts on its hinges can be found by simply reversing the directions of the forces that the
     hinges exert on the door. Hence, our task is to find the forces from the hinges on the door. Three forces act on the

     door slab: an unknown force from hinge an unknown force from hinge and the known weight attached
     at the center of mass of the door slab. The CM is located at the geometrical center of the door because the slab has
     a uniform mass density. We adopt a rectangular frame of reference with the y-axis along the direction of gravity and
     the x-axis in the plane of the slab, as shown in panel (a) of Figure 12.17, and resolve all forces into their rectangular

     components. In this way, we have four unknown component forces: two components of force                       and  and

     two components of force          and    In the free-body diagram, we represent the two forces at the hinges by

     their vector components, whose assumed orientations are arbitrary. Because there are four unknowns

     and       we must set up four independent equations. One equation is the equilibrium condition for forces in the

     x-direction. The second equation is the equilibrium condition for forces in the y-direction. The third equation is the

     equilibrium condition for torques in rotation about a hinge. Because the weight is evenly distributed between the

     hinges, we have the fourth equation,    To set up the equilibrium conditions, we draw a free-body diagram

     and choose the pivot point at the upper hinge, as shown in panel (b) of Figure 12.17. Finally, we solve the equations

12.3 Stress, Strain, and Elastic Modulus

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the concepts of stress and strain in describing elastic deformations of materials
    · Describe the types of elastic deformation of objects and materials

A model of a rigid body is an idealized example of an object that does not deform under the actions of external
forces. It is very useful when analyzing mechanical systems--and many physical objects are indeed rigid to a great
extent. The extent to which an object can be perceived as rigid depends on the physical properties of the material
from which it is made. For example, a ping-pong ball made of plastic is brittle, and a tennis ball made of rubber is
elastic when acted upon by squashing forces. However, under other circumstances, both a ping-pong ball and a
tennis ball may bounce well as rigid bodies. Similarly, someone who designs prosthetic limbs may be able to
approximate the mechanics of human limbs by modeling them as rigid bodies; however, the actual combination of
bones and tissues is an elastic medium.

For the remainder of this chapter, we move from consideration of forces that affect the motion of an object to those
that affect an object's shape. A change in shape due to the application of a force is known as a deformation. Even
very small forces are known to cause some deformation. Deformation is experienced by objects or physical media
under the action of external forces--for example, this may be squashing, squeezing, ripping, twisting, shearing, or
pulling the objects apart. In the language of physics, two terms describe the forces on objects undergoing
deformation: stress and strain.

Stress is a quantity that describes the magnitude of forces that cause deformation. Stress is generally defined as
force per unit area. When forces pull on an object and cause its elongation, like the stretching of an elastic band, we
call such stress a tensile stress. When forces cause a compression of an object, we call it a compressive stress.
When an object is being squeezed from all sides, like a submarine in the depths of an ocean, we call this kind of
stress a bulk stress (or volume stress). In other situations, the acting forces may be neither tensile nor
compressive, and still produce a noticeable deformation. For example, suppose you hold a book tightly between the
palms of your hands, then with one hand you press-and-pull on the front cover away from you, while with the other
hand you press-and-pull on the back cover toward you. In such a case, when deforming forces act tangentially to the
object's surface, we call them `shear' forces and the stress they cause is called shear stress.

The SI unit of stress is the pascal (Pa). When one newton of force presses on a unit surface area of one meter
squared, the resulting stress is one pascal:

In the Imperial system of units, the unit of stress is `psi,' which stands for `pound per square inch'  Another
unit that is often used for bulk stress is the atm (atmosphere). Conversion factors are

An object or medium under stress becomes deformed. The quantity that describes this deformation is called strain.
Strain is given as a fractional change in either length (under tensile stress) or volume (under bulk stress) or
geometry (under shear stress). Therefore, strain is a dimensionless number. Strain under a tensile stress is called
tensile strain, strain under bulk stress is called bulk strain (or volume strain), and that caused by shear stress is
called shear strain.

The greater the stress, the greater the strain; however, the relation between strain and stress does not need to be
linear. Only when stress is sufficiently low is the deformation it causes in direct proportion to the stress value. The
proportionality constant in this relation is called the elastic modulus. In the linear limit of low stress values, the
general relation between stress and strain is

                                                                                                                                                   12.33
574  12 · Static Equilibrium and Elasticity

     As we can see from dimensional analysis of this relation, the elastic modulus has the same physical unit as stress
     because strain is dimensionless.

     We can also see from Equation 12.33 that when an object is characterized by a large value of elastic modulus, the
     effect of stress is small. On the other hand, a small elastic modulus means that stress produces large strain and
     noticeable deformation. For example, a stress on a rubber band produces larger strain (deformation) than the same
     stress on a steel band of the same dimensions because the elastic modulus for rubber is two orders of magnitude
     smaller than the elastic modulus for steel.

     The elastic modulus for tensile stress is called Young's modulus; that for the bulk stress is called the bulk modulus;
     and that for shear stress is called the shear modulus. Note that the relation between stress and strain is an
     observed relation, measured in the laboratory. Elastic moduli for various materials are measured under various
     physical conditions, such as varying temperature, and collected in engineering data tables for reference (Table
     12.1). These tables are valuable references for industry and for anyone involved in engineering or construction. In
     the next section, we discuss strain-stress relations beyond the linear limit represented by Equation 12.33, in the full
     range of stress values up to a fracture point. In the remainder of this section, we study the linear limit expressed by

Tensile or Compressive Stress, Strain, and Young's Modulus

Tension or compression occurs when two antiparallel forces of equal magnitude act on an object along only one of

its dimensions, in such a way that the object does not move. One way to envision such a situation is illustrated in

Figure 12.18. A rod segment is either stretched or squeezed by a pair of forces acting along its length and

perpendicular to its cross-section. The net effect of such forces is that the rod changes its length from the original

length that it had before the forces appeared, to a new length L that it has under the action of the forces. This

change in length            may be either elongation (when L is larger than the original length or

contraction (when L is smaller than the original length  Tensile stress and strain occur when the forces are

stretching an object, causing its elongation, and the length change is positive. Compressive stress and strain

occur when the forces are contracting an object, causing its shortening, and the length change is negative.

In either of these situations, we define stress as the ratio of the deforming force to the cross-sectional area A of
the object being deformed. The symbol that we reserve for the deforming force means that this force acts
perpendicularly to the cross-section of the object. Forces that act parallel to the cross-section do not change the
length of an object. The definition of the tensile stress is

                                                                                                                                                   12.34

Tensile strain is the measure of the deformation of an object under tensile stress and is defined as the fractional
change of the object's length when the object experiences tensile stress

                                                                                                                                                   12.35

Compressive stress and strain are defined by the same formulas, Equation 12.34 and Equation 12.35, respectively.
The only difference from the tensile situation is that for compressive stress and strain, we take absolute values of
the right-hand sides in Equation 12.34 and Equation 12.35.

     FIGURE 12.18 When an object is in either tension or compression, the net force on it is zero, but the object deforms by changing its original
     length (a) Tension: The rod is elongated by (b) Compression: The rod is contracted by In both cases, the deforming force acts
     along the length of the rod and perpendicular to its cross-section. In the linear range of low stress, the cross-sectional area of the rod does
     not change.

     Young's modulus Y is the elastic modulus when deformation is caused by either tensile or compressive stress, and is
     defined by Equation 12.33. Dividing this equation by tensile strain, we obtain the expression for Young's modulus:

                                                                                                                                                        12.36

Strategy

First we find the weight of the 3.0-m-long top section of the pillar. The normal force that acts on the cross-section
located 3.0 m down from the top is the sum of the pillar's weight and the sculpture's weight. Once we have the
normal force, we use Equation 12.34 to find the stress. To find the compressive strain, we find the value of Young's
modulus for granite in Table 12.1 and invert Equation 12.36.

Solution

The volume of the pillar segment with height  and cross-sectional area           is

With the density of granite                   the mass of the pillar segment is

The weight of the pillar segment is

The weight of the sculpture is                so the normal force on the cross-sectional surface located 3.0 m
below the sculpture is

Therefore, the stress is

Young's modulus for granite is                Therefore, the compressive strain at this
position is

Significance
Notice that the normal force acting on the cross-sectional area of the pillar is not constant along its length, but
varies from its smallest value at the top to its largest value at the bottom of the pillar. Thus, if the pillar has a uniform

     Strategy

     First we compute the tensile stress in the rod under the weight of the platform in accordance with Equation 12.34.

     Then we invert Equation 12.36 to find the rod's elongation, using          From Table 12.1, Young's modulus

     Significance
     Similarly as in the example with the column, the tensile stress in this example is not uniform along the length of the
     rod. Unlike in the previous example, however, if the weight of the rod is taken into consideration, the stress in the
     rod is largest at the top and smallest at the bottom of the rod where the equipment is attached.

Bulk Stress, Strain, and Modulus

When you dive into water, you feel a force pressing on every part of your body from all directions. What you are
experiencing then is bulk stress, or in other words, pressure. Bulk stress always tends to decrease the volume
enclosed by the surface of a submerged object. The forces of this "squeezing" are always perpendicular to the
submerged surface Figure 12.22. The effect of these forces is to decrease the volume of the submerged object by an
amount compared with the volume of the object in the absence of bulk stress. This kind of deformation is
called bulk strain and is described by a change in volume relative to the original volume:

                                                                                                                                                   12.37

FIGURE 12.22 An object under increasing bulk stress always undergoes a decrease in its volume. Equal forces perpendicular to the surface
act from all directions. The effect of these forces is to decrease the volume by the amount compared to the original volume,

The bulk strain results from the bulk stress, which is a force normal to a surface that presses on the unit surface
area A of a submerged object. This kind of physical quantity, or pressure p, is defined as

                                                                                                                                                   12.38

We will study pressure in fluids in greater detail in Fluid Mechanics. An important characteristic of pressure is that it
580  12 · Static Equilibrium and Elasticity

     is a scalar quantity and does not have any particular direction; that is, pressure acts equally in all possible
     directions. When you submerge your hand in water, you sense the same amount of pressure acting on the top
     surface of your hand as on the bottom surface, or on the side surface, or on the surface of the skin between your
     fingers. What you are perceiving in this case is an increase in pressure over what you are used to feeling when
     your hand is not submerged in water. What you feel when your hand is not submerged in the water is the normal
     pressure of one atmosphere, which serves as a reference point. The bulk stress is this increase in pressure, or

          over the normal level,

     When the bulk stress increases, the bulk strain increases in response, in accordance with Equation 12.33. The
     proportionality constant in this relation is called the bulk modulus, B, or

                                                                                                                                                        12.39

     The minus sign that appears in Equation 12.39 is for consistency, to ensure that B is a positive quantity. Note that
     the minus sign is necessary because an increase in pressure (a positive quantity) always causes a decrease

          in volume, and decrease in volume is a negative quantity. The reciprocal of the bulk modulus is called
     compressibility or

                                                                                                                                                        12.40

     The term `compressibility' is used in relation to fluids (gases and liquids). Compressibility describes the change in

     the volume of a fluid per unit increase in pressure. Fluids characterized by a large compressibility are relatively easy

     to compress. For example, the compressibility of water is           and the compressibility of acetone is

     This means that under a 1.0-atm increase in pressure, the relative decrease in volume is

     approximately three times as large for acetone as it is for water.

     EXAMPLE 12.9

     Hydraulic Press

     In a hydraulic press Figure 12.23, a 250-liter volume of oil is subjected to a 2300-psi pressure increase. If the

     compressibility of oil is               find the bulk strain and the absolute decrease in the volume of oil when

     the press is operating.

     FIGURE 12.23 In a hydraulic press, when a small piston is displaced downward, the pressure in the oil is transmitted throughout the oil to
     the large piston, causing the large piston to move upward. A small force applied to a small piston causes a large pressing force, which the
     large piston exerts on an object that is either lifted or squeezed. The device acts as a mechanical lever.

     Strategy
     We must invert Equation 12.40 to find the bulk strain. First, we convert the pressure increase from psi to atm,

                                                                    and identify

Shear Stress, Strain, and Modulus

The concepts of shear stress and strain concern only solid objects or materials. Buildings and tectonic plates are
examples of objects that may be subjected to shear stresses. In general, these concepts do not apply to fluids.

Shear deformation occurs when two antiparallel forces of equal magnitude are applied tangentially to opposite
surfaces of a solid object, causing no deformation in the transverse direction to the line of force, as in the typical
example of shear stress illustrated in Figure 12.24. Shear deformation is characterized by a gradual shift of
layers in the direction tangent to the acting forces. This gradation in occurs in the transverse direction along
some distance Shear strain is defined by the ratio of the largest displacement to the transverse distance

                                                                                                                                                   12.41

Shear strain is caused by shear stress. Shear stress is due to forces that act parallel to the surface. We use the
symbol for such forces. The magnitude per surface area A where shearing force is applied is the measure of
shear stress

                                                                                                                                                   12.42

The shear modulus is the proportionality constant in Equation 12.33 and is defined by the ratio of stress to strain.
Shear modulus is commonly denoted by S:

                                                                                                                                                   12.43

     tangent to the forces.

     EXAMPLE 12.10

     An Old Bookshelf

     A cleaning person tries to move a heavy, old bookcase on a carpeted floor by pushing tangentially on the surface of
     the very top shelf. However, the only noticeable effect of this effort is similar to that seen in Figure 12.24, and it
     disappears when the person stops pushing. The bookcase is 180.0 cm tall and 90.0 cm wide with four 30.0-cm-
     deep shelves, all partially loaded with books. The total weight of the bookcase and books is 600.0 N. If the person
     gives the top shelf a 50.0-N push that displaces the top shelf horizontally by 15.0 cm relative to the motionless
     bottom shelf, find the shear modulus of the bookcase.

     Strategy

     The only pieces of relevant information are the physical dimensions of the bookcase, the value of the tangential

     force, and the displacement this force causes. We identify                                       and

                                             and we use Equation 12.43 to compute the shear modulus.

     Solution
     Substituting numbers into the equations, we obtain for the shear modulus

     We can also find shear stress and strain, respectively:

     Significance
     If the person in this example gave the shelf a healthy push, it might happen that the induced shear would collapse it
     to a pile of rubbish. Much the same shear mechanism is responsible for failures of earth-filled dams and levees; and,
     in general, for landslides.

12.4 Elasticity and Plasticity

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the limit where a deformation of material is elastic
    · Describe the range where materials show plastic behavior
    · Analyze elasticity and plasticity on a stress-strain diagram

We referred to the proportionality constant between stress and strain as the elastic modulus. But why do we call it
that? What does it mean for an object to be elastic and how do we describe its behavior?

Elasticity is the tendency of solid objects and materials to return to their original shape after the external forces
(load) causing a deformation are removed. An object is elastic when it comes back to its original size and shape
when the load is no longer present. Physical reasons for elastic behavior vary among materials and depend on the
microscopic structure of the material. For example, the elasticity of polymers and rubbers is caused by stretching
polymer chains under an applied force. In contrast, the elasticity of metals is caused by resizing and reshaping the
crystalline cells of the lattices (which are the material structures of metals) under the action of externally applied
forces.

The two parameters that determine the elasticity of a material are its elastic modulus and its elastic limit. A high
elastic modulus is typical for materials that are hard to deform; in other words, materials that require a high load to
achieve a significant strain. An example is a steel band. A low elastic modulus is typical for materials that are easily
deformed under a load; for example, a rubber band. If the stress under a load becomes too high, then when the load
is removed, the material no longer comes back to its original shape and size, but relaxes to a different shape and
size: The material becomes permanently deformed. The elastic limit is the stress value beyond which the material
no longer behaves elastically but becomes permanently deformed.

Our perception of an elastic material depends on both its elastic limit and its elastic modulus. For example, all
rubbers are characterized by a low elastic modulus and a high elastic limit; hence, it is easy to stretch them and the
stretch is noticeably large. Among materials with identical elastic limits, the most elastic is the one with the lowest
elastic modulus.

When the load increases from zero, the resulting stress is in direct proportion to strain in the way given by Equation
12.33, but only when stress does not exceed some limiting value. For stress values within this linear limit, we can
describe elastic behavior in analogy with Hooke's law for a spring. According to Hooke's law, the stretch value of a
spring under an applied force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the force. Conversely, the response force
from the spring to an applied stretch is directly proportional to the stretch. In the same way, the deformation of a
material under a load is directly proportional to the load, and, conversely, the resulting stress is directly proportional
to strain. The linearity limit (or the proportionality limit) is the largest stress value beyond which stress is no longer
proportional to strain. Beyond the linearity limit, the relation between stress and strain is no longer linear. When
stress becomes larger than the linearity limit but still within the elasticity limit, behavior is still elastic, but the
relation between stress and strain becomes nonlinear.

For stresses beyond the elastic limit, a material exhibits plastic behavior. This means the material deforms
irreversibly and does not return to its original shape and size, even when the load is removed. When stress is
gradually increased beyond the elastic limit, the material undergoes plastic deformation. Rubber-like materials
show an increase in stress with the increasing strain, which means they become more difficult to stretch and,
eventually, they reach a fracture point where they break. Ductile materials such as metals show a gradual decrease
in stress with the increasing strain, which means they become easier to deform as stress-strain values approach the
breaking point. Microscopic mechanisms responsible for plasticity of materials are different for different materials.

We can graph the relationship between stress and strain on a stress-strain diagram. Each material has its own
characteristic strain-stress curve. A typical stress-strain diagram for a ductile metal under a load is shown in Figure
12.25. In this figure, strain is a fractional elongation (not drawn to scale). When the load is gradually increased, the
linear behavior (red line) that starts at the no-load point (the origin) ends at the linearity limit at point H. For further
load increases beyond point H, the stress-strain relation is nonlinear but still elastic. In the figure, this nonlinear
region is seen between points H and E. Ever larger loads take the stress to the elasticity limit E, where elastic
584  12 · Static Equilibrium and Elasticity

     behavior ends and plastic deformation begins. Beyond the elasticity limit, when the load is removed, for example at
     P, the material relaxes to a new shape and size along the green line. This is to say that the material becomes
     permanently deformed and does not come back to its initial shape and size when stress becomes zero.

     The material undergoes plastic deformation for loads large enough to cause stress to go beyond the elasticity limit
     at E. The material continues to be plastically deformed until the stress reaches the fracture point (breaking point).
     Beyond the fracture point, we no longer have one sample of material, so the diagram ends at the fracture point. For
     the completeness of this qualitative description, it should be said that the linear, elastic, and plasticity limits denote
     a range of values rather than one sharp point.

     FIGURE 12.25 Typical stress-strain plot for a metal under a load: The graph ends at the fracture point. The arrows show the direction of
     changes under an ever-increasing load. Points H and E are the linearity and elasticity limits, respectively. Between points H and E, the
     behavior is nonlinear. The green line originating at P illustrates the metal's response when the load is removed. The permanent deformation
     has a strain value at the point where the green line intercepts the horizontal axis.

     The value of stress at the fracture point is called breaking stress (or ultimate stress). Materials with similar elastic

     properties, such as two metals, may have very different breaking stresses. For example, ultimate stress for

     aluminum is             and for steel it may be as high as            depending on the kind of steel. We can

     make a quick estimate, based on Equation 12.34, that for rods with a  cross-sectional area, the breaking load

     for an aluminum rod is                  and the breaking load for a steel rod is about nine times larger.

INTRODUCTION In this chapter, we study the nature of the gravitational force for objects as small as ourselves and
for systems as massive as entire galaxies. We show how the gravitational force affects objects on Earth and the
motion of the Universe itself. Gravity is the first force to be postulated as an action-at-a-distance force, that is,
objects exert a gravitational force on one another without physical contact and that force falls to zero only at an
infinite distance. Earth exerts a gravitational force on you, but so do our Sun, the Milky Way galaxy, and the billions of
galaxies, like those shown above, which are so distant that we cannot see them with the naked eye.

598  13 · Gravitation

     years have inspired philosophers and scientists to search for an explanation. Then we examine the simplest form of
     Newton's law of universal gravitation and how to apply it.

     The History of Gravitation

     The earliest philosophers wondered why objects naturally tend to fall toward the ground. Aristotle (384-322 BCE)
     believed that it was the nature of rocks to seek Earth and the nature of fire to seek the Heavens. Brahmagupta
     (598~665 CE) postulated that Earth was a sphere and that objects possessed a natural affinity for it, falling toward
     the center from wherever they were located.

     The motions of the Sun, our Moon, and the planets have been studied for thousands of years as well. These motions
     were described with amazing accuracy by Ptolemy (90-168 CE), whose method of epicycles described the paths of
     the planets as circles within circles. However, there is little evidence that anyone connected the motion of
     astronomical bodies with the motion of objects falling to Earth--until the seventeenth century.

     The idea of heliocentrism, in which the Sun is at the center of the solar system, dates at least as far back as
     Aristarchus of Samos in the third century BCE, but attracted little attention, and Ptolemy's geocentric (Earth-
     centered) model held sway in Europe until the sixteenth century. Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) is generally
     credited as being the first to produce a mathematical model of a heliocentric system and to challenge Ptolemy's
     geocentric system. This idea was supported by the incredibly precise naked-eye measurements of planetary
     motions by Tycho Brahe and their analysis by Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei. Kepler showed that the motion of
     each planet is an ellipse (the first of his three laws, discussed in Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion), and Robert
     Hooke (the same Hooke who formulated Hooke's law for springs) intuitively suggested that these motions are due to
     the planets being attracted to the Sun. However, it was Isaac Newton who connected the acceleration of objects
     near Earth's surface with the centripetal acceleration of the Moon in its orbit about Earth.

     Other prominent scientists and mathematicians of the time, particularly those outside of England, were reluctant to
     accept Newton's principles. It took the work of another prominent philosopher, writer, and scientist, Émilie du
     Châtelet, to establish the Newtonian gravitation as the accurate and overarching law. Du Châtelet, who had earlier
     laid the foundation for the understanding of conservation of energy as well as the principle that light had no mass,
     translated and augmented Newton's key work. She also utilized calculus to explain gravity, which helped lead to its
     acceptance.

     Finally, in Einstein's Theory of Gravity, we look at the theory of general relativity proposed by Albert Einstein in
     1916. His theory comes from a vastly different perspective, in which gravity is a manifestation of mass warping
     space and time. The consequences of his theory gave rise to many remarkable predictions, essentially all of which
     have been confirmed over the many decades following the publication of the theory (including the 2015
     measurement of gravitational waves from the merger of two black holes).

     Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

     Newton noted that objects at Earth's surface (hence at a distance of from the center of Earth) have an

     acceleration of g, but the Moon, at a distance of about  , has a centripetal acceleration about  times

     smaller than g. He could explain this by postulating that a force exists between any two objects, whose magnitude is

     given by the product of the two masses divided by the square of the distance between them. We now know that this

     inverse square law is ubiquitous in nature, a function of geometry for point sources. The strength of any source at a

     distance r is spread over the surface of a sphere centered about the mass. The surface area of that sphere is

     proportional to . In later chapters, we see this same form in the electromagnetic force.

     NEWTON'S LAW OF GRAVITATION

     Newton's law of gravitation can be expressed as

object 2.

As shown in Figure 13.2, the vector points from object 1 toward object 2, and hence represents an attractive
force between the objects. The equal but opposite force is the force on object 2 exerted by object 1.

                  FIGURE 13.2 Gravitational force acts along a line joining the centers of mass of two objects.

These equal but opposite forces reflect Newton's third law, which we discussed earlier. Note that strictly speaking,
Equation 13.1 applies to point masses--all the mass is located at one point. But it applies equally to any spherically
symmetric objects, where r is the distance between the centers of mass of those objects. In many cases, it works
reasonably well for nonsymmetrical objects, if their separation is large compared to their size, and we take r to be
the distance between the center of mass of each body.

The Cavendish Experiment

A century after Newton published his law of universal gravitation, Henry Cavendish determined the proportionality
constant G by performing a painstaking experiment. He constructed a device similar to that shown in Figure 13.3, in
which small masses are suspended from a wire. Once in equilibrium, two fixed, larger masses are placed
symmetrically near the smaller ones. The gravitational attraction creates a torsion (twisting) in the supporting wire
that can be measured.

The constant G is called the universal gravitational constant and Cavendish determined it to be

                  . The word `universal' indicates that scientists think that this constant applies to

masses of any composition and that it is the same throughout the Universe. The value of G is an incredibly small

number, showing that the force of gravity is very weak. The attraction between masses as small as our bodies, or

even objects the size of skyscrapers, is incredibly small. For example, two 1.0-kg masses located 1.0 meter apart

exert a force of  on each other. This is the weight of a typical grain of pollen.

     FIGURE 13.3 Cavendish used an apparatus similar to this to measure the gravitational attraction between two spheres (m) suspended from
     a wire and two stationary spheres (M). This is a common experiment performed in undergraduate laboratories, but it is quite challenging.
     Passing trucks outside the laboratory can create vibrations that overwhelm the gravitational forces.

     Although gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces of nature, its attractive nature is what holds us to
     Earth, causes the planets to orbit the Sun and the Sun to orbit our galaxy, and binds galaxies into clusters, ranging
     from a few to millions. Gravity is the force that forms the Universe.

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Newton's Law of Gravitation

     To determine the motion caused by the gravitational force, follow these steps:
       1. Identify the two masses, one or both, for which you wish to find the gravitational force.
       2. Draw a free-body diagram, sketching the force acting on each mass and indicating the distance between their
             centers of mass.
       3. Apply Newton's second law of motion to each mass to determine how it will move.

             EXAMPLE 13.1

     A Collision in Orbit

     Consider two nearly spherical Soyuz payload vehicles, in orbit about Earth, each with mass 9000 kg and diameter
     4.0 m. They are initially at rest relative to each other, 10.0 m from center to center. (As we will see in Kepler's Laws
     of Planetary Motion, both orbit Earth at the same speed and interact nearly the same as if they were isolated in deep
     space.) Determine the gravitational force between them and their initial acceleration. Estimate how long it takes for
     them to drift together, and how fast they are moving upon impact.
     Strategy
     We use Newton's law of gravitation to determine the force between them and then use Newton's second law to find
     the acceleration of each. For the estimate, we find the final acceleration as well and assume the acceleration is
     constant at its average value, and we use the constant-acceleration equations from Motion along a Straight Line to
     find the time and speed of the collision.

Solution
The magnitude of the force is

The initial acceleration of each payload is

The vehicles are 4.0 m in diameter, so the vehicles move from 10.0 m to 4.0 m apart, or a distance of 3.0 m each. A

similar calculation to that above, for when the vehicles are 4.0 m apart, yields an acceleration of                           ,

and the average of these two values is       . If we assume a constant acceleration of this value and

they start from rest, then the vehicles collide with speed given by

so

We use  to find                              or about 4.6 hours.

Significance

These calculations--including the initial force--are only estimates, as the vehicles are probably not spherically
symmetrical. But you can see that the force is incredibly small. Astronauts must tether themselves when doing work
outside even the massive International Space Station (ISS), as in Figure 13.4, because the gravitational attraction
cannot save them from even the smallest push away from the station.

                      FIGURE 13.4 This photo shows Ed White tethered to the Space Shuttle during a spacewalk. (credit: NASA)

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 13.1

What happens to force and acceleration as the vehicles fall together? What will our estimate of the velocity at a
collision higher or lower than the speed actually be? And finally, what would happen if the masses were not
602  13 · Gravitation

     identical? Would the force on each be the same or different? How about their accelerations?

     The effect of gravity between two objects with masses on the order of these space vehicles is indeed small. Yet, the
     effect of gravity on you from Earth is significant enough that a fall into Earth of only a few feet can be dangerous. We
     examine the force of gravity near Earth's surface in the next section.

             EXAMPLE 13.2

     Attraction between Galaxies

     Find the acceleration of our galaxy, the Milky Way, due to the nearest comparably sized galaxy, the Andromeda
     galaxy (Figure 13.5). The approximate mass of each galaxy is 800 billion solar masses (a solar mass is the mass of
     our Sun), and they are separated by 2.5 million light-years. (Note that the mass of Andromeda is not so well known
     but is believed to be slightly larger than our galaxy.) Each galaxy has a diameter of roughly 100,000 light-years

                                                .

     FIGURE 13.5 Galaxies interact gravitationally over immense distances. The Andromeda galaxy is the nearest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way,
     and they will eventually collide. (credit: Boris Stromar)

     Strategy

     As in the preceding example, we use Newton's law of gravitation to determine the force between them and then use
     Newton's second law to find the acceleration of the Milky Way. We can consider the galaxies to be point masses,
     since their sizes are about 25 times smaller than their separation. The mass of the Sun (see Appendix D) is

                       and a light-year is the distance light travels in one year,  .

Significance

Does this value of acceleration seem astoundingly small? If they start from rest, then they would accelerate directly
toward each other, "colliding" at their center of mass. Let's estimate the time for this to happen. The initial

acceleration is        , so using  , we see that it would take  for each galaxy to reach a speed of

1.0 m/s, and they would be only    closer. That is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the initial

distance between them. In reality, such motions are rarely simple. These two galaxies, along with about 50 other

smaller galaxies, are all gravitationally bound into our local cluster. Our local cluster is gravitationally bound to other

clusters in what is called a supercluster. All of this is part of the great cosmic dance that results from gravitation, as

shown in Figure 13.6.

with the Andromeda Galaxy in about 4 billion years. (credit: modification of work by NASA; ESA; A. Feild and R. van der Marel, STScI)

13.2 Gravitation Near Earth's Surface

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the connection between the constants and
    · Determine the mass of an astronomical body from free-fall acceleration at its surface
    · Describe how the value of varies due to location and Earth's rotation

In this section, we observe how Newton's law of gravitation applies at the surface of a planet and how it connects
with what we learned earlier about free fall. We also examine the gravitational effects within spherical bodies.

Weight

Recall that the acceleration of a free-falling object near Earth's surface is approximately  . The force

causing this acceleration is called the weight of the object, and from Newton's second law, it has the value mg. This

weight is present regardless of whether the object is in free fall. We now know that this force is the gravitational

force between the object and Earth. If we substitute mg for the magnitude of in Newton's law of universal

gravitation, m for , and for , we obtain the scalar equation
604  13 · Gravitation

     where r is the distance between the centers of mass of the object and Earth. The mass m of the object cancels,
     leaving

                                                                                                                                                          13.2

     The average radius of Earth is about 6370 km. Hence, for objects within a few kilometers of Earth's surface, we can

     take  (Figure 13.7). This explains why all masses free fall with the same acceleration. We have ignored the

     fact that Earth also accelerates toward the falling object, but that is acceptable as long as the mass of Earth is much

     larger than that of the object.

     FIGURE 13.7 We can take the distance between the centers of mass of Earth and an object on its surface to be the radius of Earth, provided
     that its size is much less than the radius of Earth.

             EXAMPLE 13.3
     Masses of Earth and Moon

     Have you ever wondered how we know the mass of Earth? We certainly can't place it on a scale. The values of g and
     the radius of Earth were measured with reasonable accuracy centuries ago.

       a. Use the standard values of g, , and Equation 13.2 to find the mass of Earth.
       b. Estimate the value of g on the Moon. Use the fact that the Moon has a radius of about 1700 km (a value of this

             accuracy was determined many centuries ago) and assume it has the same average density as Earth,
                             .

     Strategy
     With the known values of g and , we can use Equation 13.2 to find . For the Moon, we use the assumption of
     equal average density to determine the mass from a ratio of the volumes of Earth and the Moon.
     Solution

       a. Rearranging Equation 13.2, we have

       b. The volume of a sphere is proportional to the radius cubed, so a simple ratio gives us

We now use Equation 13.2.

Significance

As soon as Cavendish determined the value of G in 1798, the mass of Earth could be calculated. (In fact, that was
the ultimate purpose of Cavendish's experiment in the first place.) The value we calculated for g of the Moon is

incorrect. The average density of the Moon is actually only            and  at the surface. Newton

attempted to measure the mass of the Moon by comparing the effect of the Sun on Earth's ocean tides compared to

that of the Moon. His value was a factor of two too small. The most accurate values for g and the mass of the Moon

come from tracking the motion of spacecraft that have orbited the Moon. But the mass of the Moon can actually be

determined accurately without going to the Moon. Earth and the Moon orbit about a common center of mass, and

careful astronomical measurements can determine that location. The ratio of the Moon's mass to Earth's is the ratio

of [the distance from the common center of mass to the Moon's center] to [the distance from the common center of

mass to Earth's center].

Later in this chapter, we will see that the mass of other astronomical bodies also can be determined by the period of
small satellites orbiting them. But until Cavendish determined the value of G, the masses of all these bodies were
unknown.

EXAMPLE 13.4

Gravity above Earth's Surface

What is the value of g 400 km above Earth's surface, where the International Space Station is in orbit?

Strategy            and noting the radius is                          , we use Equation 13.2 to find g.
Using the value of

From Equation 13.2 we have

Significance

We often see video of astronauts in space stations, apparently weightless. But clearly, the force of gravity is acting

on them. Comparing the value of g we just calculated to that on Earth       , we see that the astronauts in the

International Space Station still have 88% of their weight. They only appear to be weightless because they are in

free fall. We will come back to this in Satellite Orbits and Energy.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 13.2

How does your weight at the top of a tall building compare with that on the first floor? Do you think engineers need
to take into account the change in the value of g when designing structural support for a very tall building?

The Gravitational Field

Equation 13.2 is a scalar equation, giving the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration as a function of the
distance from the center of the mass that causes the acceleration. But we could have retained the vector form for
the force of gravity in Equation 13.1, and written the acceleration in vector form as
606  13 · Gravitation

     We identify the vector field represented by as the gravitational field caused by mass . We can picture the field
     as shown Figure 13.8. The lines are directed radially inward and are symmetrically distributed about the mass.

                       FIGURE 13.8 Field line representation of the gravitational field created by Earth.

     The direction of is parallel to the field lines at any point. The strength of at any point is inversely proportional to
     the line spacing. Another way to state this is that the magnitude of the field in any region is proportional to the
     number of lines that pass through a unit surface area, effectively a density of lines. Since the lines are equally
     spaced in all directions, the number of lines per unit surface area at a distance r from the mass is the total number
     of lines divided by the surface area of a sphere of radius r, which is proportional to . Hence, this picture perfectly
     represents the inverse square law, in addition to indicating the direction of the field. In the field picture, we say that
     a mass m interacts with the gravitational field of mass M. We will use the concept of fields to great advantage in the
     later chapters on electromagnetism.

     Apparent Weight: Accounting for Earth's Rotation

     As we saw in Applications of Newton's Laws, objects moving at constant speed in a circle have a centripetal
     acceleration directed toward the center of the circle, which means that there must be a net force directed toward
     the center of that circle. Since all objects on the surface of Earth move through a circle every 24 hours, there must
     be a net centripetal force on each object directed toward the center of that circle.

     Let's first consider an object of mass m located at the equator, suspended from a scale (Figure 13.9). The scale

     exerts an upward force away from Earth's center. This is the reading on the scale, and hence it is the apparent

     weight of the object. The weight (mg) points toward Earth's center. If Earth were not rotating, the acceleration

     would be zero and, consequently, the net force would be zero, resulting in  . This would be the true reading

     of the weight.

FIGURE 13.9 For a person standing at the equator, the centripetal acceleration is in the same direction as the force of gravity. At
latitude , the angle the between and the force of gravity is and the magnitude of decreases with .

With rotation, the sum of these forces must provide the centripetal acceleration,  . Using Newton's second law, we
have

                                                                                                           13.3

Note that points in the same direction as the weight; hence, it is negative. The tangential speed v is the speed at

the equator and r is . We can calculate the speed simply by noting that objects on the equator travel the

circumference of Earth in 24 hours. Instead, let's use the alternative expression for from Motion in Two and Three

Dimensions. Recall that the tangential speed is related to the angular speed by    . Hence, we have

. By rearranging Equation 13.3 and substituting  , the apparent weight at the equator is

The angular speed of Earth everywhere is

Substituting for the values or and , we have     . This is only 0.34% of the value of gravity,
so it is clearly a small correction.
608  13 · Gravitation

     EXAMPLE 13.5

     Zero Apparent Weight

     How fast would Earth need to spin for those at the equator to have zero apparent weight? How long would the length
     of the day be?

     Strategy

     Using Equation 13.3, we can set the apparent weight ( ) to zero and determine the centripetal acceleration
     required. From that, we can find the speed at the equator. The length of day is the time required for one complete
     rotation.

     Solution

     From Equation 13.2, we have      , so setting  , we get                                     . Using the expression

     for , substituting for Earth's radius and the standard value of gravity, we get

     The period T is the time for one complete rotation. Therefore, the tangential speed is the circumference divided by
     T, so we have

     This is about 84 minutes.

     Significance
     We will see later in this chapter that this speed and length of day would also be the orbital speed and period of a
     satellite in orbit at Earth's surface. While such an orbit would not be possible near Earth's surface due to air
     resistance, it certainly is possible only a few hundred miles above Earth.

     Results Away from the Equator

     At the pole,      and            , just as is the case without rotation. At any other latitude , the situation

     is more complicated. The centripetal acceleration is directed toward point P in the figure, and the radius becomes

                   . The vector sum of the weight and must point toward point P, hence no longer points away from

     the center of Earth. (The difference is small and exaggerated in the figure.) A plumb bob will always point along this

     deviated direction. All buildings are built aligned along this deviated direction, not along a radius through the center

     of Earth. For the tallest buildings, this represents a deviation of a few feet at the top.

     It is also worth noting that Earth is not a perfect sphere. The interior is partially liquid, and this enhances Earth
     bulging at the equator due to its rotation. The radius of Earth is about 30 km greater at the equator compared to the
     poles. It is left as an exercise to compare the strength of gravity at the poles to that at the equator using Equation
     13.2. The difference is comparable to the difference due to rotation and is in the same direction. Apparently, you
     really can lose "weight" by moving to the tropics.

     Gravity Away from the Surface

     Earlier we stated without proof that the law of gravitation applies to spherically symmetrical objects, where the
     mass of each body acts as if it were at the center of the body. Since Equation 13.2 is derived from Equation 13.1, it is

     Access for free at openstax.org

also valid for symmetrical mass distributions, but both equations are valid only for values of  . As we saw in

Example 13.4, at 400 km above Earth's surface, where the International Space Station orbits, the value of g is

     . (We will see later that this is also the centripetal acceleration of the ISS.)

For  , Equation 13.1 and Equation 13.2 are not valid. However, we can determine g for these cases using a

principle that comes from Gauss's law, which is a powerful mathematical tool that we study in more detail later in

the course. A consequence of Gauss's law, applied to gravitation, is that only the mass within r contributes to the

gravitational force. Also, that mass, just as before, can be considered to be located at the center. The gravitational

effect of the mass outside r has zero net effect.

Two very interesting special cases occur. For a spherical planet with constant density, the mass within r is the

density times the volume within r. This mass can be considered located at the center. Replacing with only the

mass within r,                                     , and with r, Equation 13.2 becomes

The value of g, and hence your weight, decreases linearly as you descend down a hole to the center of the spherical
planet. At the center, you are weightless, as the mass of the planet pulls equally in all directions. Actually, Earth's
density is not constant, nor is Earth solid throughout. Figure 13.10 shows the profile of g if Earth had constant
density and the more likely profile based upon estimates of density derived from seismic data.

FIGURE 13.10 For  , the value of g for the case of constant density is the straight green line. The blue line from the PREM

(Preliminary Reference Earth Model) is probably closer to the actual profile for g.

The second interesting case concerns living on a spherical shell planet. This scenario has been proposed in many
science fiction stories. Ignoring significant engineering issues, the shell could be constructed with a desired radius
and total mass, such that g at the surface is the same as Earth's. Can you guess what happens once you descend in
an elevator to the inside of the shell, where there is no mass between you and the center? What benefits would this
provide for traveling great distances from one point on the sphere to another? And finally, what effect would there
610  13 · Gravitation

     be if the planet was spinning?

     13.3 Gravitational Potential Energy and Total Energy

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Determine changes in gravitational potential energy over great distances
         · Apply conservation of energy to determine escape velocity
         · Determine whether astronomical bodies are gravitationally bound

     We studied gravitational potential energy in Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy, where the value of g
     remained constant. We now develop an expression that works over distances such that g is not constant. This is
     necessary to correctly calculate the energy needed to place satellites in orbit or to send them on missions in space.

     Gravitational Potential Energy beyond Earth

     We defined work and potential energy in Work and Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy.

     The usefulness of those definitions is the ease with which we can solve many problems using conservation of

     energy. Potential energy is particularly useful for forces that change with position, as the gravitational force does

     over large distances. In Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy, we showed that the change in gravitational

     potential energy near Earth's surface is     . This works very well if g does not change significantly

     between and . We return to the definition of work and potential energy to derive an expression that is correct

     over larger distances.

     Recall that work (W) is the integral of the dot product between force and distance. Essentially, it is the product of the
     component of a force along a displacement times that displacement. We define as the negative of the work
     done by the force we associate with the potential energy. For clarity, we derive an expression for moving a mass m
     from distance from the center of Earth to distance . However, the result can easily be generalized to any two
     objects changing their separation from one value to another.

     Consider Figure 13.11, in which we take m from a distance from Earth's center to a distance that is from the

     center. Gravity is a conservative force (its magnitude and direction are functions of location only), so we can take any

     path we wish, and the result for the calculation of work is the same. We take the path shown, as it greatly simplifies

     the integration. We first move radially outward from distance to distance , and then move along the arc of a

     circle until we reach the final position. During the radial portion, is opposite to the direction we travel along , so

                                      Along the arc, is perpendicular to , so        . No work is done as we move

     along the arc. Using the expression for the gravitational force and noting the values for  along the two

     segments of our path, we have

     Since                   , we can adopt a simple expression for :

FIGURE 13.11 The work integral, which determines the change in potential energy, can be evaluated along the path shown in red.

Note two important items with this definition. First,   . The potential energy is zero when the two

masses are infinitely far apart. Only the difference in U is important, so the choice of   is merely one

of convenience. (Recall that in earlier gravity problems, you were free to take           at the top or bottom of a

building, or anywhere.) Second, note that U becomes increasingly more negative as the masses get closer. That is

consistent with what you learned about potential energy in Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy. As the two

masses are separated, positive work must be done against the force of gravity, and hence, U increases (becomes

less negative). All masses naturally fall together under the influence of gravity, falling from a higher to a lower

potential energy.

        EXAMPLE 13.6

Lifting a Payload

How much energy is required to lift the 9000-kg Soyuz vehicle from Earth's surface to the height of the ISS, 400 km
above the surface?

Strategy
Use Equation 13.2 to find the change in potential energy of the payload. That amount of work or energy must be
supplied to lift the payload.

Solution
Paying attention to the fact that we start at Earth's surface and end at 400 km above the surface, the change in U is

We insert the values

and convert 400 km into                . We find       . It is positive, indicating an increase in

potential energy, as we would expect.

Significance
For perspective, consider that the average US household energy use in 2013 was 909 kWh per month. That is energy
of
612  13 · Gravitation

     So our result is an energy expenditure equivalent to 10 months. But this is just the energy needed to raise the
     payload 400 km. If we want the Soyuz to be in orbit so it can rendezvous with the ISS and not just fall back to Earth,
     it needs a lot of kinetic energy. As we see in the next section, that kinetic energy is about five times that of . In
     addition, far more energy is expended lifting the propulsion system itself. Space travel is not cheap.

     Why not use the simpler expression        ? How significant would the error be? (Recall the previous

     result, in Example 13.4, that the value g at 400 km above the Earth is      .)

     Conservation of Energy

     In Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy, we described how to apply conservation of energy for systems with
     conservative forces. We were able to solve many problems, particularly those involving gravity, more simply using
     conservation of energy. Those principles and problem-solving strategies apply equally well here. The only change is
     to place the new expression for potential energy into the conservation of energy equation,

                                         .

                                                                                                                                                          13.5

     Note that we use M, rather than , as a reminder that we are not restricted to problems involving Earth. However,

     we still assume that             . (For problems in which this is not true, we need to include the kinetic energy of both

     masses and use conservation of momentum to relate the velocities to each other. But the principle remains the

     same.)

     Escape velocity
     Escape velocity is often defined to be the minimum initial velocity of an object that is required to escape the surface
     of a planet (or any large body like a moon) and never return. As usual, we assume no energy lost to an atmosphere,
     should there be any.

     Consider the case where an object is launched from the surface of a planet with an initial velocity directed away

     from the planet. With the minimum velocity needed to escape, the object would just come to rest infinitely far away,

     that is, the object gives up the last of its kinetic energy just as it reaches infinity, where the force of gravity becomes

     zero. Since                , this means the total energy is zero. Thus, we find the escape velocity from the surface

     of an astronomical body of mass M and radius R by setting the total energy equal to zero. At the surface of the body,

     the object is located at          and it has escape velocity  . It reaches       with velocity  .

     Substituting into Equation 13.5, we have

     Solving for the escape velocity,                                        

                                                                                                                                   13.6

     Notice that m has canceled out of the equation. The escape velocity is the same for all objects, regardless of mass.
     Also, we are not restricted to the surface of the planet; R can be any starting point beyond the surface of the planet.

        EXAMPLE 13.7

Escape from Earth

What is the escape speed from the surface of Earth? Assume there is no energy loss from air resistance. Compare
this to the escape speed from the Sun, starting from Earth's orbit.

Strategy
We use Equation 13.6, clearly defining the values of R and M. To escape Earth, we need the mass and radius of
Earth. For escaping the Sun, we need the mass of the Sun, and the orbital distance between Earth and the Sun.

Solution
Substituting the values for Earth's mass and radius directly into Equation 13.6, we obtain

That is about 11 km/s or 25,000 mph. To escape the Sun, starting from Earth's orbit, we use

                               and  . The result is                                               or about 42 km/s.

Significance

The speed needed to escape the Sun (leave the solar system) is nearly four times the escape speed from Earth's
surface. But there is help in both cases. Earth is rotating, at a speed of nearly 460 m/s at the equator, and we can
use that velocity to help escape, or to achieve orbit. For this reason, many commercial space companies maintain
launch facilities near the equator. To escape the Sun, there is even more help. Earth revolves about the Sun at a
speed of approximately 30 km/s. By launching in the direction that Earth is moving, we need only an additional 12
km/s. The use of gravitational assist from other planets, essentially a gravity slingshot technique, allows space
probes to reach even greater speeds. In this slingshot technique, the vehicle approaches the planet and is
accelerated by the planet's gravitational attraction. It has its greatest speed at the closest point of approach,
although it accelerates opposite to the motion in equal measure as it moves away. But relative to the planet, the
vehicle's speed far before the approach, and long after, are the same. If the directions are chosen correctly, that can
result in a significant increase (or decrease if needed) in the vehicle's speed relative to the rest of the solar system.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 13.4

If we send a probe out of the solar system starting from Earth's surface, do we only have to escape the Sun?

Energy and gravitationally bound objects
As stated previously, escape velocity can be defined as the initial velocity of an object that can escape the surface of
a moon or planet. More generally, it is the speed at any position such that the total energy is zero. If the total energy
is zero or greater, the object escapes. If the total energy is negative, the object cannot escape. Let's see why that is
the case.

As noted earlier, we see that        . If the total energy is zero, then as m reaches a value of r that

approaches infinity, U becomes zero and so must the kinetic energy. Hence, m comes to rest infinitely far away from

M. It has "just escaped" M. If the total energy is positive, then kinetic energy remains at  and certainly m does

not return. When the total energy is zero or greater, then we say that m is not gravitationally bound to M.

On the other hand, if the total energy is negative, then the kinetic energy must reach zero at some finite value of r,
614  13 · Gravitation

     where U is negative and equal to the total energy. The object can never exceed this finite distance from M, since to
     do so would require the kinetic energy to become negative, which is not possible. We say m is gravitationally bound
     to M.

     We have simplified this discussion by assuming that the object was headed directly away from the planet. What is
     remarkable is that the result applies for any velocity. Energy is a scalar quantity and hence Equation 13.5 is a scalar
     equation--the direction of the velocity plays no role in conservation of energy. It is possible to have a gravitationally
     bound system where the masses do not "fall together," but maintain an orbital motion about each other.

     We have one important final observation. Earlier we stated that if the total energy is zero or greater, the object
     escapes. Strictly speaking, Equation 13.5 and Equation 13.6 apply for point objects. They apply to finite-sized,
     spherically symmetric objects as well, provided that the value for r in Equation 13.5 is always greater than the sum
     of the radii of the two objects. If r becomes less than this sum, then the objects collide. (Even for greater values of r,
     but near the sum of the radii, gravitational tidal forces could create significant effects if both objects are planet
     sized. We examine tidal effects in Tidal Forces.) Neither positive nor negative total energy precludes finite-sized
     masses from colliding. For real objects, direction is important.

     EXAMPLE 13.8

     How Far Can an Object Escape?

     Let's consider the preceding example again, where we calculated the escape speed from Earth and the Sun, starting
     from Earth's orbit. We noted that Earth already has an orbital speed of 30 km/s. As we see in the next section, that is
     the tangential speed needed to stay in circular orbit. If an object had this speed at the distance of Earth's orbit, but
     was headed directly away from the Sun, how far would it travel before coming to rest? Ignore the gravitational
     effects of any other bodies.

     Strategy

     The object has initial kinetic and potential energies that we can calculate. When its speed reaches zero, it is at its
     maximum distance from the Sun. We use Equation 13.5, conservation of energy, to find the distance at which kinetic
     energy is zero.

     Solution

     The initial position of the object is Earth's radius of orbit and the intial speed is given as 30 km/s. The final velocity is
     zero, so we can solve for the distance at that point from the conservation of energy equation. Using

                       and                         , we have

     where the mass m cancels. Solving for we get             . Note that this is twice the initial distance from

     the Sun and takes us past Mars's orbit, but not quite to the asteroid belt.

     Significance
     The object in this case reached a distance exactly twice the initial orbital distance. We will see the reason for this in
     the next section when we calculate the speed for circular orbits.

13.4 Satellite Orbits and Energy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe the mechanism for circular orbits
    · Find the orbital periods and speeds of satellites
    · Determine whether objects are gravitationally bound

The Moon orbits Earth. In turn, Earth and the other planets orbit the Sun. The space directly above our atmosphere
is filled with artificial satellites in orbit. We examine the simplest of these orbits, the circular orbit, to understand the
relationship between the speed and period of planets and satellites in relation to their positions and the bodies that
they orbit.

Circular Orbits

As noted at the beginning of this chapter, Nicolaus Copernicus first suggested that Earth and all other planets orbit
the Sun in circles. He further noted that orbital periods increased with distance from the Sun. Later analysis by
Kepler showed that these orbits are actually ellipses, but the orbits of most planets in the solar system are nearly
circular. Earth's orbital distance from the Sun varies a mere 2%. The exception is the eccentric orbit of Mercury,
whose orbital distance varies nearly 40%.

Determining the orbital speed and orbital period of a satellite is much easier for circular orbits, so we make that
assumption in the derivation that follows. As we described in the previous section, an object with negative total
energy is gravitationally bound and therefore is in orbit. Our computation for the special case of circular orbits will
confirm this. We focus on objects orbiting Earth, but our results can be generalized for other cases.

Consider a satellite of mass m in a circular orbit about Earth at distance r from the center of Earth (Figure 13.12). It
has centripetal acceleration directed toward the center of Earth. Earth's gravity is the only force acting, so Newton's
second law gives
616  13 · Gravitation

     FIGURE 13.12 A satellite of mass m orbiting at radius r from the center of Earth. The gravitational force supplies the centripetal
     acceleration.

     We solve for the speed of the orbit, noting that m cancels, to get the orbital speed

                                                                                                                                         13.7

     Consistent with what we saw in Equation 13.2 and Equation 13.6, m does not appear in Equation 13.7. The value of

     g, the escape velocity, and orbital velocity depend only upon the distance from the center of the planet, and not

     upon the mass of the object being acted upon. Notice the similarity in the equations for  and . The escape

     velocity is exactly times greater, about 40%, than the orbital velocity. This comparison was noted in Example

     13.7, and it is true for a satellite at any radius.

     To find the period of a circular orbit, we note that the satellite travels the circumference of the orbit in one

     period T. Using the definition of speed, we have     . We substitute this into Equation 13.7 and rearrange

     to get

                                                                                                                                         13.8

     We see in the next section that this represents Kepler's third law for the case of circular orbits. It also confirms

     Copernicus's observation that the period of a planet increases with increasing distance from the Sun. We need only

     replace with      in Equation 13.8.

     We conclude this section by returning to our earlier discussion about astronauts in orbit appearing to be weightless,
     as if they were free-falling towards Earth. In fact, they are in free fall. Consider the trajectories shown in Figure
     13.13. (This figure is based on a drawing by Newton in his Principia and also appeared earlier in Motion in Two and
     Three Dimensions.) All the trajectories shown that hit the surface of Earth have less than orbital velocity. The
     astronauts would accelerate toward Earth along the noncircular paths shown and feel weightless. (Astronauts
     actually train for life in orbit by riding in airplanes that free fall for 30 seconds at a time.) But with the correct orbital
     velocity, Earth's surface curves away from them at exactly the same rate as they fall toward Earth. Of course, staying
     the same distance from the surface is the point of a circular orbit.

We can summarize our discussion of orbiting satellites in the following Problem-Solving Strategy.

        PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Orbits and Conservation of Energy

  1. Determine whether the equations for speed, energy, or period are valid for the problem at hand. If not, start
        with the first principles we used to derive those equations.

  2. To start from first principles, draw a free-body diagram and apply Newton's law of gravitation and Newton's
        second law.

  3. Along with the definitions for speed and energy, apply Newton's second law of motion to the bodies of
        interest.

EXAMPLE 13.9

The International Space Station

Determine the orbital speed and period for the International Space Station (ISS).

Strategy

Since the ISS orbits  above Earth's surface, the radius at which it orbits is            . We

use Equation 13.7 and Equation 13.8 to find the orbital speed and period, respectively.

Solution
Using Equation 13.7, the orbital velocity is

which is about 17,000 mph. Using Equation 13.8, the period is
618  13 · Gravitation

     which is just over 90 minutes.

     Significance
     The ISS is considered to be in low Earth orbit (LEO). Nearly all satellites are in LEO, including most weather
     satellites. GPS satellites, at about 20,000 km, are considered medium Earth orbit. The higher the orbit, the more
     energy is required to put it there and the more energy is needed to reach it for repairs. Of particular interest are the
     satellites in geosynchronous orbit. All fixed satellite dishes on the ground pointing toward the sky, such as TV
     reception dishes, are pointed toward geosynchronous satellites. These satellites are placed at the exact distance,
     and just above the equator, such that their period of orbit is 1 day. They remain in a fixed position relative to Earth's
     surface.

     Determining the Mass of Earth

     Determine the mass of Earth from the orbit of the Moon.

     Strategy

     We use Equation 13.8, solve for , and substitute for the period and radius of the orbit. The radius and period of
     the Moon's orbit was measured with reasonable accuracy thousands of years ago. From the astronomical data in

     Appendix D, the period of the Moon is 27.3 days          , and the average distance between the centers of
     Earth and the Moon is 384,000 km.

     Solution
     Solving for ,

     Significance

     Compare this to the value of     that we obtained in Example 13.5, using the value of g at the surface

     of Earth. Although these values are very close (~0.8%), both calculations use average values. The value of g varies

     from the equator to the poles by approximately 0.5%. But the Moon has an elliptical orbit in which the value of r

     varies just over 10%. (The apparent size of the full Moon actually varies by about this amount, but it is difficult to

     notice through casual observation as the time from one extreme to the other is many months.)

Galactic Speed and Period

Let's revisit Example 13.2. Assume that the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are in a circular orbit about each
other. What would be the velocity of each and how long would their orbital period be? Assume the mass of each is
800 billion solar masses and their centers are separated by 2.5 million light years.

Strategy
We cannot use Equation 13.7 and Equation 13.8 directly because they were derived assuming that the object of
mass m orbited about the center of a much larger planet of mass M. We determined the gravitational force in
Example 13.2 using Newton's law of universal gravitation. We can use Newton's second law, applied to the
centripetal acceleration of either galaxy, to determine their tangential speed. From that result we can determine the
period of the orbit.

Solution
In Example 13.2, we found the force between the galaxies to be

and that the acceleration of each galaxy is

Since the galaxies are in a circular orbit, they have centripetal acceleration. If we ignore the effect of other galaxies,

then, as we learned in Linear Momentum and Collisions and Fixed-Axis Rotation, the centers of mass of the two

galaxies remain fixed. Hence, the galaxies must orbit about this common center of mass. For equal masses, the

center of mass is exactly half way between them. So the radius of the orbit,  , is not the same as the distance

between the galaxies, but one-half that value, or 1.25 million light-years. These two different values are shown in

Figure 13.14.

     Significance

     The orbital speed of 47 km/s might seem high at first. But this speed is comparable to the escape speed from the
     Sun, which we calculated in an earlier example. To give even more perspective, this period is nearly four times
     longer than the time that the Universe has been in existence.

     In fact, the present relative motion of these two galaxies is such that they are expected to collide in about 4 billion
     years. Although the density of stars in each galaxy makes a direct collision of any two stars unlikely, such a collision
     will have a dramatic effect on the shape of the galaxies. Examples of such collisions are well known in astronomy.

     Galaxies are not single objects. How does the gravitational force of one galaxy exerted on the "closer" stars of the
     other galaxy compare to those farther away? What effect would this have on the shape of the galaxies themselves?

     Energy in Circular Orbits

     In Gravitational Potential Energy and Total Energy, we argued that objects are gravitationally bound if their total
     energy is negative. The argument was based on the simple case where the velocity was directly away or toward the
     planet. We now examine the total energy for a circular orbit and show that indeed, the total energy is negative. As
     we did earlier, we start with Newton's second law applied to a circular orbit,

     In the last step, we multiplied by r on each side. The right side is just twice the kinetic energy, so we have

     The total energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies, so our final result is

                                                                                                                     13.9

     We can see that the total energy is negative, with the same magnitude as the kinetic energy. For circular orbits, the
     magnitude of the kinetic energy is exactly one-half the magnitude of the potential energy. Remarkably, this result
     applies to any two masses in circular orbits about their common center of mass, at a distance r from each other. The
     proof of this is left as an exercise. We will see in the next section that a very similar expression applies in the case of

Energy Required to Orbit

In Example 13.8, we calculated the energy required to simply lift the 9000-kg Soyuz vehicle from Earth's surface to
the height of the ISS, 400 km above the surface. In other words, we found its change in potential energy. We now
ask, what total energy change in the Soyuz vehicle is required to take it from Earth's surface and put it in orbit with
the ISS for a rendezvous (Figure 13.15)? How much of that total energy is kinetic energy?

FIGURE 13.15 The Soyuz in a rendezvous with the ISS. Note that this diagram is not to scale; the Soyuz is very small compared to the ISS
and its orbit is much closer to Earth. (credit: modification of works by NASA)

Strategy

The energy required is the difference in the Soyuz's total energy in orbit and that at Earth's surface. We can use

Equation 13.9 to find the total energy of the Soyuz at the ISS orbit. But the total energy at the surface is simply the

potential energy, since it starts from rest. [Note that we do not use Equation 13.9 at the surface, since we are not in

orbit at the surface.] The kinetic energy can then be found from the difference in the total energy change and the

change in potential energy found in Example 13.8. Alternatively, we can use Equation 13.7 to find  and

calculate the kinetic energy directly from that. The total energy required is then the kinetic energy plus the change in

potential energy found in Example 13.8.

Solution
From Equation 13.9, the total energy of the Soyuz in the same orbit as the ISS is

The total energy at Earth's surface is
622  13 · Gravitation

     The change in energy is                 . To get the kinetic energy, we subtract the change

     in potential energy from Example 13.6,  . That gives us

                                             . As stated earlier, the kinetic energy of a circular orbit is

     always one-half the magnitude of the potential energy, and the same as the magnitude of the total energy. Our

     result confirms this.

     The second approach is to use Equation 13.7 to find the orbital speed of the Soyuz, which we did for the ISS in
     Example 13.9.

     So the kinetic energy of the Soyuz in orbit is

     the same as in the previous method. The total energy is just

     Significance
     The kinetic energy of the Soyuz is nearly eight times the change in its potential energy, or 90% of the total energy
     needed for the rendezvous with the ISS. And it is important to remember that this energy represents only the energy
     that must be given to the Soyuz. With our present rocket technology, the mass of the propulsion system (the rocket
     fuel, its container and combustion system) far exceeds that of the payload, and a tremendous amount of kinetic
     energy must be given to that mass. So the actual cost in energy is many times that of the change in energy of the
     payload itself.

     13.5 Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the conic sections and how they relate to orbital motion
         · Describe how orbital velocity is related to conservation of angular momentum
         · Determine the period of an elliptical orbit from its major axis
     Using the precise data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler carefully analyzed the positions in the sky of all
     the known planets and the Moon, plotting their positions at regular intervals of time. From this analysis, he
     formulated three laws, which we address in this section.

     Kepler's First Law

     The prevailing view during the time of Kepler was that all planetary orbits were circular. The data for Mars presented
     the greatest challenge to this view and that eventually encouraged Kepler to give up the popular idea. Kepler's first
     law states that every planet moves along an ellipse, with the Sun located at a focus of the ellipse. An ellipse is
     defined as the set of all points such that the sum of the distance from each point to two foci is a constant. Figure
     13.16 shows an ellipse and describes a simple way to create it.

FIGURE 13.16 (a) An ellipse is a curve in which the sum of the distances from a point on the curve to two foci  is a constant.

From this definition, you can see that an ellipse can be created in the following way. Place a pin at each focus, then place a loop of string

around a pencil and the pins. Keeping the string taught, move the pencil around in a complete circuit. If the two foci occupy the same place,

the result is a circle--a special case of an ellipse. (b) For an elliptical orbit, if  , then m follows an elliptical path with M at one focus.

More exactly, both m and M move in their own ellipse about the common center of mass.

For elliptical orbits, the point of closest approach of a planet to the Sun is called the perihelion. It is labeled point A
in Figure 13.16. The farthest point is the aphelion and is labeled point B in the figure. For the Moon's orbit about
Earth, those points are called the perigee and apogee, respectively.

An ellipse has several mathematical forms, but all are a specific case of the more general equation for conic
sections. There are four different conic sections, all given by the equation

                                                                                                                13.10

The variables r and are shown in Figure 13.17 in the case of an ellipse. The constants and e are determined by
the total energy and angular momentum of the satellite at a given point. The constant e is called the eccentricity.
The values of and e determine which of the four conic sections represents the path of the satellite.

FIGURE 13.17 As before, the distance between the planet and the Sun is r, and the angle measured from the x-axis, which is along the
major axis of the ellipse, is .

One of the real triumphs of Newton's law of universal gravitation, with the force proportional to the inverse of the
distance squared, is that when it is combined with his second law, the solution for the path of any satellite is a conic
section. Every path taken by m is one of the four conic sections: a circle or an ellipse for bound or closed orbits, or a
parabola or hyperbola for unbounded or open orbits. These conic sections are shown in Figure 13.18.
624  13 · Gravitation

     FIGURE 13.18 All motion caused by an inverse square force is one of the four conic sections and is determined by the energy and direction
     of the moving body.

     If the total energy is negative, then      , and Equation 13.10 represents a bound or closed orbit of either an

     ellipse or a circle, where       . [You can see from Equation 13.10 that for  ,  , and hence the radius is

     constant.] For ellipses, the eccentricity is related to how oblong the ellipse appears. A circle has zero eccentricity,

     whereas a very long, drawn-out ellipse has an eccentricity near one.

     If the total energy is exactly zero, then  and the path is a parabola. Recall that a satellite with zero total energy

     has exactly the escape velocity. (The parabola is formed only by slicing the cone parallel to the tangent line along

     the surface.) Finally, if the total energy is positive, then  and the path is a hyperbola. These last two paths

     represent unbounded orbits, where m passes by M once and only once. This situation has been observed for several

     comets that approach the Sun and then travel away, never to return.

     We have confined ourselves to the case in which the smaller mass (planet) orbits a much larger, and hence
     stationary, mass (Sun), but Equation 13.10 also applies to any two gravitationally interacting masses. Each mass
     traces out the exact same-shaped conic section as the other. That shape is determined by the total energy and
     angular momentum of the system, with the center of mass of the system located at the focus. The ratio of the
     dimensions of the two paths is the inverse of the ratio of their masses.

     Orbital Transfers

     People have imagined traveling to the other planets of our solar system since they were discovered. But how can we
     best do this? The most efficient method was discovered in 1925 by Walter Hohmann, inspired by a popular science
     fiction novel of that time. The method is now called a Hohmann transfer. For the case of traveling between two
     circular orbits, the transfer is along a "transfer" ellipse that perfectly intercepts those orbits at the aphelion and
     perihelion of the ellipse. Figure 13.19 shows the case for a trip from Earth's orbit to that of Mars. As before, the Sun
     is at the focus of the ellipse.

     For any ellipse, the semi-major axis is defined as one-half the sum of the perihelion and the aphelion. In Figure

     13.17, the semi-major axis is the distance from the origin to either side of the ellipse along the x-axis, or just one-

     half the longest axis (called the major axis). Hence, to travel from one circular orbit of radius to another circular

     orbit of radius , the aphelion of the transfer ellipse will be equal to the value of the larger orbit, while the

     perihelion will be the smaller orbit. The semi-major axis, denoted a, is therefore given by  .

13.5 · Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion                                                                                         625

                             FIGURE 13.19 The transfer ellipse has its perihelion at Earth's orbit and aphelion at Mars' orbit.

Let's take the case of traveling from Earth to Mars. For the moment, we ignore the planets and assume we are alone
in Earth's orbit and wish to move to Mars' orbit. From Equation 13.9, the expression for total energy, we can see that
the total energy for a spacecraft in the larger orbit (Mars) is greater (less negative) than that for the smaller orbit
(Earth). To move onto the transfer ellipse from Earth's orbit, we will need to increase our kinetic energy, that is, we
need a velocity boost. The most efficient method is a very quick acceleration along the circular orbital path, which is
also along the path of the ellipse at that point. (In fact, the acceleration should be instantaneous, such that the
circular and elliptical orbits are congruent during the acceleration. In practice, the finite acceleration is short enough
that the difference is not a significant consideration.) Once you have arrived at Mars orbit, you will need another
velocity boost to move into that orbit, or you will stay on the elliptical orbit and simply fall back to perihelion where
you started. For the return trip, you simply reverse the process with a retro-boost at each transfer point.

To make the move onto the transfer ellipse and then off again, we need to know each circular orbit velocity and the
transfer orbit velocities at perihelion and aphelion. The velocity boost required is simply the difference between the
circular orbit velocity and the elliptical orbit velocity at each point. We can find the circular orbital velocities from
Equation 13.7. To determine the velocities for the ellipse, we state without proof (as it is beyond the scope of this
course) that total energy for an elliptical orbit is

where is the mass of the Sun and a is the semi-major axis. Remarkably, this is the same as Equation 13.9 for
circular orbits, but with the value of the semi-major axis replacing the orbital radius. Since we know the potential
energy from Equation 13.4, we can find the kinetic energy and hence the velocity needed for each point on the
ellipse. We leave it as a challenge problem to find those transfer velocities for an Earth-to-Mars trip.

We end this discussion by pointing out a few important details. First, we have not accounted for the gravitational
potential energy due to Earth and Mars, or the mechanics of landing on Mars. In practice, that must be part of the
calculations. Second, timing is everything. You do not want to arrive at the orbit of Mars to find out it isn't there. We
must leave Earth at precisely the correct time such that Mars will be at the aphelion of our transfer ellipse just as we
arrive. That opportunity comes about every 2 years. And returning requires correct timing as well. The total trip
would take just under 3 years! There are other options that provide for a faster transit, including a gravity assist flyby
of Venus. But these other options come with an additional cost in energy and danger to the astronauts.

     Kepler's Second Law

     Kepler's second law states that a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times, that is, the area divided by time,

     called the areal velocity, is constant. Consider Figure 13.20. The time it takes a planet to move from position A to B,

     sweeping out area , is exactly the time taken to move from position C to D, sweeping area , and to move from

     E to F, sweeping out area . These areas are the same:             .

                                 FIGURE 13.20 The shaded regions shown have equal areas and represent the same time interval.

     Comparing the areas in the figure and the distance traveled along the ellipse in each case, we can see that in order
     for the areas to be equal, the planet must speed up as it gets closer to the Sun and slow down as it moves away. This
     behavior is completely consistent with our conservation equation, Equation 13.5. But we will show that Kepler's
     second law is actually a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum, which holds for any system with
     only radial forces.

     Recall the definition of angular momentum from Angular Momentum,     . For the case of orbiting motion,

     is the angular momentum of the planet about the Sun, is the position vector of the planet measured from the Sun,

     and        is the instantaneous linear momentum at any point in the orbit. Since the planet moves along the

     ellipse, is always tangent to the ellipse.

     We can resolve the linear momentum into two components: a radial component along the line to the Sun, and a

     component         perpendicular to . The cross product for angular momentum can then be written as

                                                            .

     The first term on the right is zero because is parallel to , and in the second term is perpendicular to      , so

     the magnitude of the cross product reduces to                     . Note that the angular momentum does not

     depend upon . Since the gravitational force is only in the radial direction, it can change only and not             ;

     hence, the angular momentum must remain constant.

     Now consider Figure 13.21. A small triangular area is swept out in time . The velocity is along the path and it

     makes an angle with the radial direction. Hence, the perpendicular velocity is given by             . The planet

     moves a distance                 projected along the direction perpendicular to r. Since the area of a triangle is one-

     half the base (r) times the height , for a small displacement, the area is given by      . Substituting for

     , multiplying by m in the numerator and denominator, and rearranging, we obtain

The areal velocity is simply the rate of change of area with time, so we have

Since the angular momentum is constant, the areal velocity must also be constant. This is exactly Kepler's second
law. As with Kepler's first law, Newton showed it was a natural consequence of his law of gravitation.

Kepler's Third Law

Kepler's third law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit.
In Satellite Orbits and Energy, we derived Kepler's third law for the special case of a circular orbit. Equation 13.8
gives us the period of a circular orbit of radius r about Earth:

For an ellipse, recall that the semi-major axis is one-half the sum of the perihelion and the aphelion. For a circular
orbit, the semi-major axis (a) is the same as the radius for the orbit. In fact, Equation 13.8 gives us Kepler's third law
if we simply replace r with a and square both sides.

                                                                                                                                                   13.11

We have changed the mass of Earth to the more general M, since this equation applies to satellites orbiting any large
mass.

        EXAMPLE 13.13

Orbit of Halley's Comet

Determine the semi-major axis of the orbit of Halley's comet, given that it arrives at perihelion every 75.3 years. If
the perihelion is 0.586 AU, what is the aphelion?
Strategy
We are given the period, so we can rearrange Equation 13.11, solving for the semi-major axis. Since we know the
value for the perihelion, we can use the definition of the semi-major axis, given earlier in this section, to find the
aphelion. We note that 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) is the average radius of Earth's orbit and is defined to be

                                 .
628  13 · Gravitation

     Solution
     Rearranging Equation 13.11 and inserting the values of the period of Halley's comet and the mass of the Sun, we
     have

     This yields a value of  or 17.8 AU for the semi-major axis.

     The semi-major axis is one-half the sum of the aphelion and perihelion, so we have

     Substituting for the values, we found for the semi-major axis and the value given for the perihelion, we find the value
     of the aphelion to be 35.0 AU.

     Significance
     Edmond Halley, a contemporary of Newton, first suspected that three comets, reported in 1531, 1607, and 1682,
     were actually the same comet. Before Tycho Brahe made measurements of comets, it was believed that they were
     one-time events, perhaps disturbances in the atmosphere, and that they were not affected by the Sun. Halley used
     Newton's new mechanics to predict his namesake comet's return in 1758.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 13.9

     The nearly circular orbit of Saturn has an average radius of about 9.5 AU and has a period of 30 years, whereas
     Uranus averages about 19 AU and has a period of 84 years. Is this consistent with our results for Halley's comet?

     13.6 Tidal Forces

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the origins of Earth's ocean tides
         · Describe how neap and leap tides differ
         · Describe how tidal forces affect binary systems
     The origin of Earth's ocean tides has been a subject of continuous investigation for over 2000 years. But the work of
     Newton is considered to be the beginning of the true understanding of the phenomenon. Ocean tides are the result
     of gravitational tidal forces. These same tidal forces are present in any astronomical body. They are responsible for
     the internal heat that creates the volcanic activity on Io, one of Jupiter's moons, and the breakup of stars that get
     too close to black holes.

     Lunar Tides

     If you live on an ocean shore almost anywhere in the world, you can observe the rising and falling of the sea level
     about twice per day. This is caused by a combination of Earth's rotation about its axis and the gravitational attraction
     of both the Moon and the Sun.
     Let's consider the effect of the Moon first. In Figure 13.22, we are looking "down" onto Earth's North Pole. One side
     of Earth is closer to the Moon than the other side, by a distance equal to Earth's diameter. Hence, the gravitational
     force is greater on the near side than on the far side. The magnitude at the center of Earth is between these values.

                                                           13.6 · Tidal Forces                                                                629

This is why a tidal bulge appears on both sides of Earth.

FIGURE 13.22 The tidal force stretches Earth along the line between Earth and the Moon. It is the difference between the gravitational
force from the far side to the near side, along with the orbit of Earth and the Moon around each other, that creates the tidal bulge on both
sides of the planet. Tidal variations of the oceans are on the order of few meters; hence, this diagram is greatly exaggerated.

The net force on Earth causes it to orbit about the Earth-Moon center of mass, located about 1600 km below Earth's
surface along the line between Earth and the Moon. The tidal force can be viewed as the difference between the
force at the center of Earth and that at any other location. In Figure 13.23, this difference is shown at sea level,
where we observe the ocean tides. (Note that the change in sea level caused by these tidal forces is measured from
the baseline sea level. We saw earlier that Earth bulges many kilometers at the equator due to its rotation. This
defines the baseline sea level and here we consider only the much smaller tidal bulge measured from that baseline
sea level.)

FIGURE 13.23 The tidal force is the difference between the gravitational force at the center and that elsewhere. In this figure, the tidal
forces are shown at the ocean surface. These forces would diminish to zero as you approach Earth's center.

Why does the rise and fall of the tides occur twice per day? Look again at Figure 13.22. If Earth were not rotating
and the Moon was fixed, then the bulges would remain in the same location on Earth. Relative to the Moon, the
bulges stay fixed--along the line connecting Earth and the Moon. But Earth rotates (in the direction shown by the
blue arrow) approximately every 24 hours. In 6 hours, the near and far locations of Earth move to where the low
tides are occurring, and 6 hours later, those locations are back to the high-tide position. Since the Moon also orbits
Earth approximately every 28 days, and in the same direction as Earth rotates, the time between high (and low)
tides is actually about 12.5 hours. The actual timing of the tides is complicated by numerous factors, the most
important of which is another astronomical body--the Sun.

The Effect of the Sun on Tides

In addition to the Moon's tidal forces on Earth's oceans, the Sun exerts a tidal force as well. The gravitational
attraction of the Sun on any object on Earth is nearly 200 times that of the Moon. However, as we show later in an
630  13 · Gravitation

     example, the tidal effect of the Sun is less than that of the Moon, but a significant effect nevertheless. Depending
     upon the positions of the Moon and Sun relative to Earth, the net tidal effect can be amplified or attenuated.

     Figure 13.22 illustrates the relative positions of the Sun and the Moon that create the largest tides, called spring
     tides (or leap tides). During spring tides, Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are aligned and the tidal effects add. (Recall
     that the tidal forces cause bulges on both sides.) Figure 13.22(c) shows the relative positions for the smallest tides,
     called neap tides. The extremes of both high and low tides are affected. Spring tides occur during the new or full
     moon, and neap tides occur at half-moon.

     You can see an animation (https://openstax.org/l/21tidesinmot01) of the tides in motion.

     Moon make a right triangle with Earth. (Figure is not drawn to scale.)

     The Magnitude of the Tides

     With accurate data for the positions of the Moon and the Sun, the time of maximum and minimum tides at most
     locations on our planet can be predicted accurately.

at more than 3000 locations around the United States.

The magnitude of the tides, however, is far more complicated. The relative angles of Earth and the Moon determine
spring and neap tides, but the magnitudes of these tides are affected by the distances from Earth as well. Tidal
forces are greater when the distances are smaller. Both the Moon's orbit about Earth and Earth's orbit about the Sun
are elliptical, so a spring tide is exceptionally large if it occurs when the Moon is at perigee and Earth is at perihelion.
Conversely, it is relatively small if it occurs when the Moon is at apogee and Earth is at aphelion.

The greatest causes of tide variation are the topography of the local shoreline and the bathymetry (the profile of the
depth) of the ocean floor. The range of tides due to these effects is astounding. Although ocean tides are much
smaller than a meter in many places around the globe, the tides at the Bay of Fundy (Figure 13.25), on the east
coast of Canada, can be as much as 16.3 meters.

Earth. Repeat for the Sun and then compare the results to confirm that the Moon's tidal forces are about twice that
of the Sun.
Strategy
We use Newton's law of gravitation given by Equation 13.1. We need the masses of the Moon and the Sun and their
distances from Earth, as well as the radius of Earth. We use the astronomical data from Appendix D.
Solution
Substituting the mass of the Moon and mean distance from Earth to the Moon, we have

In the denominator, we use the minus sign for the near side and the plus sign for the far side. The results are

The Moon's gravitational force is nearly 7% higher at the near side of Earth than at the far side, but both forces are
much less than that of Earth itself on the 1.0-kg mass. Nevertheless, this small difference creates the tides. We now
repeat the problem, but substitute the mass of the Sun and the mean distance between the Earth and Sun. The
results are

     We have to keep six significant digits since we wish to compare the difference between them to the difference for
     the Moon. (Although we can't justify the absolute value to this accuracy, since all values in the calculation are the
     same except the distances, the accuracy in the difference is still valid to three digits.) The difference between the
     near and far forces on a 1.0-kg mass due to the Moon is

     whereas the difference for the Sun is

     Note that a more proper approach is to write the difference in the two forces with the difference between the near
     and far distances explicitly expressed. With just a bit of algebra we can show that

     where and are the same to three significant digits, but their difference  , equal to the diameter of

     Earth, is also known to three significant digits. The results of the calculation are the same. This approach would be

     necessary if the number of significant digits needed exceeds that available on your calculator or computer.

     Significance

     Note that the forces exerted by the Sun are nearly 200 times greater than the forces exerted by the Moon. But the
     difference in those forces for the Sun is half that for the Moon. This is the nature of tidal forces. The Moon has a
     greater tidal effect because the fractional change in distance from the near side to the far side is so much greater for
     the Moon than it is for the Sun.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 13.10

     Earth exerts a tidal force on the Moon. Is it greater than, the same as, or less than that of the Moon on Earth? Be
     careful in your response, as tidal forces arise from the difference in gravitational forces between one side and the
     other. Look at the calculations we performed for the tidal force on Earth and consider the values that would change
     significantly for the Moon. The diameter of the Moon is one-fourth that of Earth. Tidal forces on the Moon are not
     easy to detect, since there is no liquid on the surface.

     Other Tidal Effects

     Tidal forces exist between any two bodies. The effect stretches the bodies along the line between their centers.
     Although the tidal effect on Earth's seas is observable on a daily basis, long-term consequences cannot be observed
     so easily. One consequence is the dissipation of rotational energy due to friction during flexure of the bodies
     themselves. Earth's rotation rate is slowing down as the tidal forces transfer rotational energy into heat. The other
     effect, related to this dissipation and conservation of angular momentum, is called "locking" or tidal
     synchronization. It has already happened to most moons in our solar system, including Earth's Moon. The Moon
     keeps one face toward Earth--its rotation rate has locked into the orbital rate about Earth. The same process is
     happening to Earth, and eventually it will keep one face toward the Moon. If that does happen, we would no longer
     see tides, as the tidal bulge would remain in the same place on Earth, and half the planet would never see the Moon.
     However, this locking will take many billions of years, perhaps not before our Sun expires.

     One of the more dramatic example of tidal effects is found on Io, one of Jupiter's moons. In 1979, the Voyager
     spacecraft sent back dramatic images of volcanic activity on Io. It is the only other astronomical body in our solar
     system on which we have found such activity. Figure 13.26 shows a more recent picture of Io taken by the New
     Horizons spacecraft on its way to Pluto, while using a gravity assist from Jupiter.

For some stars, the effect of tidal forces can be catastrophic. The tidal forces in very close binary systems can be
strong enough to rip matter from one star to the other, once the tidal forces exceed the cohesive self-gravitational
forces that hold the stars together. This effect can be seen in normal stars that orbit nearby compact stars, such as
neutron stars or black holes. Figure 13.27 shows an artist's rendition of this process. As matter falls into the
compact star, it forms an accretion disc that becomes super-heated and radiates in the X-ray spectrum.

FIGURE 13.27 Tidal forces from a compact object can tear matter away from an orbiting star. In addition to the accretion disc orbiting the
compact object, material is often ejected along relativistic jets as shown. (credit: modification of work by ESO/L. Calçada/M. Kornmesser)

The energy output of these binary systems can exceed the typical output of thousands of stars. Another example
might be a quasar. Quasars are very distant and immensely bright objects, often exceeding the energy output of
entire galaxies. It is the general consensus among astronomers that they are, in fact, massive black holes producing
radiant energy as matter that has been tidally ripped from nearby stars falls into them.

     13.7 Einstein's Theory of Gravity

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe how the theory of general relativity approaches gravitation
         · Explain the principle of equivalence
         · Calculate the Schwarzschild radius of an object
         · Summarize the evidence for black holes

     Newton's law of universal gravitation accurately predicts much of what we see within our solar system. Indeed, only
     Newton's laws have been needed to accurately send every space vehicle on its journey. The paths of Earth-crossing
     asteroids, and most other celestial objects, can be accurately determined solely with Newton's laws. Nevertheless,
     many phenomena have shown a discrepancy from what Newton's laws predict, including the orbit of Mercury and
     the effect that gravity has on light. In this section, we examine a different way of envisioning gravitation.

     A Revolution in Perspective

     In 1905, Albert Einstein published his theory of special relativity. This theory is discussed in great detail in Relativity
     (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/5-introduction), so we say only a few words here. In
     this theory, no motion can exceed the speed of light--it is the speed limit of the Universe. This simple fact has been
     verified in countless experiments. However, it has incredible consequences--space and time are no longer absolute.
     Two people moving relative to one another do not agree on the length of objects or the passage of time. Almost all of
     the mechanics you learned in previous chapters, while remarkably accurate even for speeds of many thousands of
     miles per second, begin to fail when approaching the speed of light.

     This speed limit on the Universe was also a challenge to the inherent assumption in Newton's law of gravitation that
     gravity is an action-at-a-distance force. That is, without physical contact, any change in the position of one mass is
     instantly communicated to all other masses. This assumption does not come from any first principle, as Newton's
     theory simply does not address the question. (The same was believed of electromagnetic forces, as well. It is fair to
     say that most scientists were not completely comfortable with the action-at-a-distance concept.)

     A second assumption also appears in Newton's law of gravitation Equation 13.1. The masses are assumed to be

     exactly the same as those used in Newton's second law,  . We made that assumption in many of our

     derivations in this chapter. Again, there is no underlying principle that this must be, but experimental results are

     consistent with this assumption. In Einstein's subsequent theory of general relativity (1916), both of these issues

     were addressed. His theory was a theory of space-time geometry and how mass (and acceleration) distort and

     interact with that space-time. It was not a theory of gravitational forces. The mathematics of the general theory is

     beyond the scope of this text, but we can look at some underlying principles and their consequences.

     The Principle of Equivalence

     Einstein came to his general theory in part by wondering why someone who was free falling did not feel their weight.
     Indeed, it is common to speak of astronauts orbiting Earth as being weightless, despite the fact that Earth's gravity
     is still quite strong there. In Einstein's general theory, there is no difference between free fall and being weightless.
     This is called the principle of equivalence. The equally surprising corollary to this is that there is no difference
     between a uniform gravitational field and a uniform acceleration in the absence of gravity. Let's focus on this last
     statement. Although a perfectly uniform gravitational field is not feasible, we can approximate it very well.

     Within a reasonably sized laboratory on Earth, the gravitational field is essentially uniform. The corollary states

     that any physical experiments performed there have the identical results as those done in a laboratory accelerating

     at  in deep space, well away from all other masses. Figure 13.28 illustrates the concept.

FIGURE 13.28 According to the principle of equivalence, the results of all experiments performed in a laboratory in a uniform gravitational
field are identical to the results of the same experiments performed in a uniformly accelerating laboratory.

How can these two apparently fundamentally different situations be the same? The answer is that gravitation is not
a force between two objects but is the result of each object responding to the effect that the other has on the space-
time surrounding it. A uniform gravitational field and a uniform acceleration have exactly the same effect on space-
time.

A Geometric Theory of Gravity

Euclidian geometry assumes a "flat" space in which, among the most commonly known attributes, a straight line is
the shortest distance between two points, the sum of the angles of all triangles must be 180 degrees, and parallel
lines never intersect. Non-Euclidean geometry was not seriously investigated until the nineteenth century, so it is
not surprising that Euclidean space is inherently assumed in all of Newton's laws.

The general theory of relativity challenges this long-held assumption. Only empty space is flat. The presence of
mass--or energy, since relativity does not distinguish between the two--distorts or curves space and time, or space-
time, around it. The motion of any other mass is simply a response to this curved space-time. Figure 13.29 is a two-
dimensional representation of a smaller mass orbiting in response to the distorted space created by the presence of
a larger mass. In a more precise but confusing picture, we would also see space distorted by the orbiting mass, and
both masses would be in motion in response to the total distortion of space. Note that the figure is a representation
to help visualize the concept. These are distortions in our three-dimensional space and time. We do not see them as
we would a dimple on a ball. We see the distortion only by careful measurements of the motion of objects and light
as they move through space.
636  13 · Gravitation

           FIGURE 13.29 A smaller mass orbiting in the distorted space-time of a larger mass. In fact, all mass or energy distorts space-time.

     For weak gravitational fields, the results of general relativity do not differ significantly from Newton's law of
     gravitation. But for intense gravitational fields, the results diverge, and general relativity has been shown to predict
     the correct results. Even in our Sun's relatively weak gravitational field at the distance of Mercury's orbit, we can
     observe the effect. Starting in the mid-1800s, Mercury's elliptical orbit has been carefully measured. However,
     although it is elliptical, its motion is complicated by the fact that the perihelion position of the ellipse slowly
     advances. Most of the advance is due to the gravitational pull of other planets, but a small portion of that
     advancement could not be accounted for by Newton's law. At one time, there was even a search for a "companion"
     planet that would explain the discrepancy. But general relativity correctly predicts the measurements. Since then,
     many measurements, such as the deflection of light of distant objects by the Sun, have verified that general
     relativity correctly predicts the observations.

     We close this discussion with one final comment. We have often referred to distortions of space-time or distortions
     in both space and time. In both special and general relativity, the dimension of time has equal footing with each
     spatial dimension (differing in its place in both theories only by an ultimately unimportant scaling factor). Near a
     very large mass, not only is the nearby space "stretched out," but time is dilated or "slowed." We discuss these
     effects more in the next section.

     Black Holes

     Einstein's theory of gravitation is expressed in one deceptively simple-looking tensor equation (tensors are a
     generalization of scalars and vectors), which expresses how a mass determines the curvature of space-time around
     it. The solutions to that equation yield one of the most fascinating predictions: the black hole. The prediction is that
     if an object is sufficiently dense, it will collapse in upon itself and be surrounded by an event horizon from which
     nothing can escape. The name "black hole," which was coined by astronomer John Wheeler in 1969, refers to the
     fact that light cannot escape such an object. Karl Schwarzschild was the first person to note this phenomenon in
     1916, but at that time, it was considered mostly to be a mathematical curiosity.

     Surprisingly, the idea of a massive body from which light cannot escape dates back to the late 1700s.
     Independently, John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace used Newton's law of gravitation to show that light leaving
     the surface of a star with enough mass could not escape. Their work was based on the fact that the speed of light
     had been measured by Ole Rømer in 1676. He noted discrepancies in the data for the orbital period of the moon Io

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                  13.7 · Einstein's Theory of Gravity                                         637

about Jupiter. Rømer realized that the difference arose from the relative positions of Earth and Jupiter at different
times and that he could find the speed of light from that difference. Michell and Laplace both realized that since light
had a finite speed, there could be a star massive enough that the escape speed from its surface could exceed that
speed. Hence, light always would fall back to the star. Oddly, observers far enough away from the very largest stars
would not be able to see them, yet they could see a smaller star from the same distance.

Recall that in Gravitational Potential Energy and Total Energy, we found that the escape speed, given by Equation
13.6, is independent of the mass of the object escaping. Even though the nature of light was not fully understood at
the time, the mass of light, if it had any, was not relevant. Hence, Equation 13.6 should be valid for light. Substituting
c, the speed of light, for the escape velocity, we have

Thus, we only need values for R and M such that the escape velocity exceeds c, and then light will not be able to
escape. Michell posited that if a star had the density of our Sun and a radius that extended just beyond the orbit of
Mars, then light would not be able to escape from its surface. He also conjectured that we would still be able to
detect such a star from the gravitational effect it would have on objects around it. This was an insightful conclusion,
as this is precisely how we infer the existence of such objects today. While we have yet to, and may never, visit a
black hole, the circumstantial evidence for them has become so compelling that few astronomers doubt their
existence.

Before we examine some of that evidence, we turn our attention back to Schwarzschild's solution to the tensor

equation from general relativity. In that solution arises a critical radius, now called the Schwarzschild radius       .

For any mass M, if that mass were compressed to the extent that its radius becomes less than the Schwarzschild

radius, then the mass will collapse to a singularity, and anything that passes inside that radius cannot escape. Once

inside , the arrow of time takes all things to the singularity. (In a broad mathematical sense, a singularity is where

the value of a function goes to infinity. In this case, it is a point in space of zero volume with a finite mass. Hence, the

mass density and gravitational energy become infinite.) The Schwarzschild radius is given by

                                                                                              13.12

If you look at our escape velocity equation with  , you will notice that it gives precisely this result. But that is

merely a fortuitous accident caused by several incorrect assumptions. One of these assumptions is the use of the

incorrect classical expression for the kinetic energy for light. Just how dense does an object have to be in order to

turn into a black hole?

        EXAMPLE 13.15

Calculating the Schwarzschild Radius

Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for both the Sun and Earth. Compare the density of the nucleus of an atom to the
density required to compress Earth's mass uniformly to its Schwarzschild radius. The density of a nucleus is about

                          .

Strategy
We use Equation 13.12 for this calculation. We need only the masses of Earth and the Sun, which we obtain from the
astronomical data given in Appendix D.

Solution
Substituting the mass of the Sun, we have
638  13 · Gravitation

     This is a diameter of only about 6 km. If we use the mass of Earth, we get    . This is a diameter
     of less than 2 cm! If we pack Earth's mass into a sphere with the radius    , we get a density of

     Significance
     A neutron star is the most compact object known--outside of a black hole itself. The neutron star is composed of
     neutrons, with the density of an atomic nucleus, and, like many black holes, is believed to be the remnant of a
     supernova--a star that explodes at the end of its lifetime. To create a black hole from Earth, we would have to
     compress it to a density thirteen orders of magnitude greater than that of a neutron star. This process would require
     unimaginable force. There is no known mechanism that could cause an Earth-sized object to become a black hole.
     For the Sun, you should be able to show that it would have to be compressed to a density only about 80 times that
     of a nucleus. (Note: Once the mass is compressed within its Schwarzschild radius, general relativity dictates that it
     will collapse to a singularity. These calculations merely show the density we must achieve to initiate that collapse.)

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 13.11

     Consider the density required to make Earth a black hole compared to that required for the Sun. What conclusion
     can you draw from this comparison about what would be required to create a black hole? Would you expect the
     Universe to have many black holes with small mass?

     The event horizon
     The Schwarzschild radius is also called the event horizon of a black hole. We noted that both space and time are
     stretched near massive objects, such as black holes. Figure 13.30 illustrates that effect on space. The distortion
     caused by our Sun is actually quite small, and the diagram is exaggerated for clarity. Consider the neutron star,
     described in Example 13.15. Although the distortion of space-time at the surface of a neutron star is very high, the
     radius is still larger than its Schwarzschild radius. Objects could still escape from its surface.

     However, if a neutron star gains additional mass, it would eventually collapse, shrinking beyond the Schwarzschild
     radius. Once that happens, the entire mass would be pulled, inevitably, to a singularity. In the diagram, space is
     stretched to infinity. Time is also stretched to infinity. As objects fall toward the event horizon, we see them
     approaching ever more slowly, but never reaching the event horizon. As outside observers, we never see objects
     pass through the event horizon--effectively, time is stretched to a stop.

FIGURE 13.30 The space distortion becomes more noticeable around increasingly larger masses. Once the mass density reaches a critical
level, a black hole forms and the fabric of space-time is torn. The curvature of space is greatest at the surface of each of the first three
objects shown and is finite. The curvature then decreases (not shown) to zero as you move to the center of the object. But the black hole is
different. The curvature becomes infinite: The surface has collapsed to a singularity, and the cone extends to infinity. (Note: These diagrams
are not to any scale.) (credit: modification of work by NASA)

Observational evidence of neutron stars and black holes
The first validated neutron star was discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967. Burnell observed a regular radio
pulse from an distant object, a phenomenon not previously observed. After further analysis and the discovery of a
second pulsar (as the objects would later be called), the researchers and scientific community recognized that the
pulses were caused by rapidly rotating neutron stars. At about the same time, a number of other astronomers,
including Iosof Shklovsky, observed radio sources that would be proven to be neutron stars. These discoveries
renewed interest in black holes. Evidence for black holes is based upon several types of observations, such as
radiation analysis of X-ray binaries, gravitational lensing of the light from distant galaxies, and the motion of visible
objects around invisible partners. We will focus on these later observations as they relate to what we have learned
in this chapter. Although light cannot escape from a black hole for us to see, we can nevertheless see the
gravitational effect of the black hole on surrounding masses.

The closest, and perhaps most dramatic, evidence for a black hole is at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. The
UCLA Galactic Group, using data obtained by the W. M. Keck telescopes, has determined the orbits of several stars
near the center of our galaxy. Some of that data is shown in Figure 13.31. The orbits of two stars are highlighted.
From measurements of the periods and sizes of their orbits, it is estimated that they are orbiting a mass of
approximately 4 million solar masses. Note that the mass must reside in the region created by the intersection of
the ellipses of the stars. The region in which that mass must reside would fit inside the orbit of Mercury--yet nothing
is seen there in the visible spectrum. In 2020, UCLA astrophysicist Andrea Ghez and Plank Institute's (Germany)
Reinhardt Genzel shared the Nobel prize for the discovery of the supermassive object. They shared the prize with
Richard Penrose, whose mathematical models proved that black holes can actually form and align with Einstein's
theory. Since their work, the world has actually seen a black hole, thanks to the Event Horizon Telescope. The global
network of observatories combined massive amounts of data in order to produce remarkable images of two black
holes: first at the center of galaxy Messier 87, and second at the center of the Milky Way, Saggitarious A.

     The physics of stellar creation and evolution is well established. The ultimate source of energy that makes stars
     shine is the self-gravitational energy that triggers fusion. The general behavior is that the more massive a star, the
     brighter it shines and the shorter it lives. The logical inference is that a mass that is 4 million times the mass of our
     Sun, confined to a very small region, and that cannot be seen, has no viable interpretation other than a black hole.
     Extragalactic observations strongly suggest that black holes are common at the center of galaxies.

     and the image of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way.

     Dark matter
     Stars orbiting near the very heart of our galaxy provide strong evidence for a black hole there, but the orbits of stars
     far from the center suggest another intriguing phenomenon that is observed indirectly as well. Recall from
     Gravitation Near Earth's Surface that we can consider the mass for spherical objects to be located at a point at the
     center for calculating their gravitational effects on other masses. Similarly, we can treat the total mass that lies
     within the orbit of any star in our galaxy as being located at the center of the Milky Way disc. We can estimate that
     mass from counting the visible stars and include in our estimate the mass of the black hole at the center as well.

     But when we do that, we find the orbital speed of the stars is far too fast to be caused by that amount of matter.
     Astronomer Vera Rubin disovered this phenomenon in the 1970s while researching the movement of spiral galaxies.
     She observed that their outermost reaches were rotating as quickly as their centers, which was not the predicted
     outcome. Figure 13.32 shows the orbital velocities of stars as a function of their distance from the center of the
     Milky Way. The blue line represents the velocities we would expect from our estimates of the mass, whereas the
     green curve is what we get from direct measurements. Rubin calculated that the rotational velocity of galaxies
     should have been enough to cause them to fly apart, unless there was a significant discrepancy between their
     observable matter and their actual matter. This became known as the galaxy rotation problem. Rubin proposed that
     massive amounts of unseen matter must be present in and around the galaxies for the rotation speeds to occur.
     Furthermore, the velocity profile does not follow what we expect from the observed distribution of visible stars. Not
     only is the estimate of the total mass inconsistent with the data, but the expected distribution is inconsistent as
     well. Rubin's 1978 discovery provided much more concrete and widespread evidence of dark matter, a term Fritz
     Zwicky coined in 1933 when he observed a similar anomaly while examining a galaxy cluster.

There are two prevailing ideas of what this matter could be--WIMPs and MACHOs. WIMPs stands for weakly
interacting massive particles. These particles (neutrinos are one example) interact very weakly with ordinary matter
and, hence, are very difficult to detect directly. MACHOs stands for massive compact halo objects, which are
composed of ordinary baryonic matter, such as neutrons and protons. There are unresolved issues with both of
these ideas, and far more research will be needed to solve the mystery.

INTRODUCTION Picture yourself walking along a beach on the eastern shore of the United States. The air smells of
sea salt and the sun warms your body. Suddenly, an alert appears on your cell phone. A tropical depression has
formed into a hurricane. Atmospheric pressure has fallen to nearly 15% below average. As a result, forecasters
expect torrential rainfall, winds in excess of 100 mph, and millions of dollars in damage. As you prepare to evacuate,
you wonder: How can such a small drop in pressure lead to such a severe change in the weather?
Pressure is a physical phenomenon that is responsible for much more than just the weather. Changes in pressure
cause ears to "pop" during takeoff in an airplane. Changes in pressure can also cause scuba divers to suffer a
sometimes fatal disorder known as the "bends," which occurs when nitrogen dissolved in the water of the body at
652  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     extreme depths returns to a gaseous state in the body as the diver surfaces. Pressure lies at the heart of the
     phenomena called buoyancy, which causes hot air balloons to rise and ships to float. Before we can fully understand
     the role that pressure plays in these phenomena, we need to discuss the states of matter and the concept of
     density.

     14.1 Fluids, Density, and Pressure

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · State the different phases of matter
         · Describe the characteristics of the phases of matter at the molecular or atomic level
         · Distinguish between compressible and incompressible materials
         · Define density and its related SI units
         · Compare and contrast the densities of various substances
         · Define pressure and its related SI units
         · Explain the relationship between pressure and force
         · Calculate force given pressure and area

     Matter most commonly exists as a solid, liquid, or gas; these states are known as the three common phases of
     matter. We will look at each of these phases in detail in this section.

     Characteristics of Solids

     Solids are rigid and have specific shapes and definite volumes. The atoms or molecules in a solid are in close
     proximity to each other, and there is a significant force between these molecules. Solids will take a form determined
     by the nature of these forces between the molecules. Although true solids are not incompressible, it nevertheless
     requires a large force to change the shape of a solid. In some cases, the force between molecules can cause the
     molecules to organize into a lattice as shown in Figure 14.2. The structure of this three-dimensional lattice is
     represented as molecules connected by rigid bonds (modeled as stiff springs), which allow limited freedom for
     movement. Even a large force produces only small displacements in the atoms or molecules of the lattice, and the
     solid maintains its shape. Solids also resist shearing forces. (Shearing forces are forces applied tangentially to a
     surface, as described in Static Equilibrium and Elasticity.)

     Characteristics of Fluids

     Liquids and gases are considered to be fluids because they yield to shearing forces, whereas solids resist them. Like
     solids, the molecules in a liquid are bonded to neighboring molecules, but possess many fewer of these bonds. The
     molecules in a liquid are not locked in place and can move with respect to each other. The distance between
     molecules is similar to the distances in a solid, and so liquids have definite volumes, but the shape of a liquid
     changes, depending on the shape of its container. Gases are not bonded to neighboring atoms and can have large
     separations between molecules. Gases have neither specific shapes nor definite volumes, since their molecules
     move to fill the container in which they are held (Figure 14.2).

FIGURE 14.2 (a) Atoms in a solid are always in close contact with neighboring atoms, held in place by forces represented here by springs.
(b) Atoms in a liquid are also in close contact but can slide over one another. Forces between the atoms strongly resist attempts to
compress the atoms. (c) Atoms in a gas move about freely and are separated by large distances. A gas must be held in a closed container to
prevent it from expanding freely and escaping.

Liquids deform easily when stressed and do not spring back to their original shape once a force is removed. This
occurs because the atoms or molecules in a liquid are free to slide about and change neighbors. That is, liquids flow
(so they are a type of fluid), with the molecules held together by mutual attraction. When a liquid is placed in a
container with no lid, it remains in the container. Because the atoms are closely packed, liquids, like solids, resist
compression; an extremely large force is necessary to change the volume of a liquid.

In contrast, atoms in gases are separated by large distances, and the forces between atoms in a gas are therefore
very weak, except when the atoms collide with one another. This makes gases relatively easy to compress and
allows them to flow (which makes them fluids). When placed in an open container, gases, unlike liquids, will escape.

In this chapter, we generally refer to both gases and liquids simply as fluids, making a distinction between them only
when they behave differently. There exists one other phase of matter, plasma, which exists at very high
temperatures. At high temperatures, molecules may disassociate into atoms, and atoms disassociate into electrons
(with negative charges) and protons (with positive charges), forming a plasma. Plasma will not be discussed in depth
in this chapter because plasma has very different properties from the three other common phases of matter,
discussed in this chapter, due to the strong electrical forces between the charges.

Density

Suppose a block of brass and a block of wood have exactly the same mass. If both blocks are dropped in a tank of
water, why does the wood float and the brass sink (Figure 14.3)? This occurs because the brass has a greater
density than water, whereas the wood has a lower density than water.
654  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     FIGURE 14.3 (a) A block of brass and a block of wood both have the same weight and mass, but the block of wood has a much greater
     volume. (b) When placed in a fish tank filled with water, the cube of brass sinks and the block of wood floats. (The block of wood is the same
     in both pictures; it was turned on its side to fit on the scale.) (credit: modification of works by Joseph J. Trout, Stockton University)

     Density is an important characteristic of substances. It is crucial, for example, in determining whether an object
     sinks or floats in a fluid.

     DENSITY

     The average density of a substance or object is defined as its mass per unit volume,

                                                                                                            14.1

     cubic centimeter,          , where

     The metric system was originally devised so that water would have a density of        , equivalent to        .

     Thus, the basic mass unit, the kilogram, was first devised to be the mass of 1000 mL of water, which has a volume of

TABLE 14.1 Densities of Some Common Substances

As you can see by examining Table 14.1, the density of an object may help identify its composition. The density of

gold, for example, is about 2.5 times the density of iron, which is about 2.5 times the density of aluminum. Density

also reveals something about the phase of the matter and its substructure. Notice that the densities of liquids and

solids are roughly comparable, consistent with the fact that their atoms are in close contact. The densities of gases

are much less than those of liquids and solids, because the atoms in gases are separated by large amounts of empty

space. The gases are displayed for a standard temperature of  and a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa, and

there is a strong dependence of the densities on temperature and pressure. The densities of the solids and liquids

displayed are given for the standard temperature of  and the densities of solids and liquids depend on the

temperature. The density of solids and liquids normally increase with decreasing temperature.

Table 14.2 shows the density of water in various phases and temperature. The density of water increases with

decreasing temperature, reaching a maximum at        and then decreases as the temperature falls below               .

This behavior of the density of water explains why ice forms at the top of a body of water.

     The density of a substance is not necessarily constant throughout the volume of a substance. If the density is

     constant throughout a substance, the substance is said to be a homogeneous substance. A solid iron bar is an

     example of a homogeneous substance. The density is constant throughout, and the density of any sample of the

     substance is the same as its average density. If the density of a substance were not constant, the substance is said

     to be a heterogeneous substance. A chunk of Swiss cheese is an example of a heterogeneous material containing

     both the solid cheese and gas-filled voids. The density at a specific location within a heterogeneous material is

     called local density, and is given as a function of location,   (Figure 14.4).

     FIGURE 14.4 Density may vary throughout a heterogeneous mixture. Local density at a point is obtained from dividing mass by volume in a
     small volume around a given point.

     Local density can be obtained by a limiting process, based on the average density in a small volume around the point
     in question, taking the limit where the size of the volume approaches zero,

                                                                                                                                                          14.2

     where is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume.

     Since gases are free to expand and contract, the densities of the gases vary considerably with temperature, whereas
     the densities of liquids vary little with temperature. Therefore, the densities of liquids are often treated as constant,
     with the density equal to the average density.

     Density is a dimensional property; therefore, when comparing the densities of two substances, the units must be

     taken into consideration. For this reason, a more convenient, dimensionless quantity called the specific gravity is

     often used to compare densities. Specific gravity is defined as the ratio of the density of the material to the density

     of water at  and one atmosphere of pressure, which is           :

The comparison uses water because the density of water is            , which was originally used to define the

kilogram. Specific gravity, being dimensionless, provides a ready comparison among materials without having to

worry about the unit of density. For instance, the density of aluminum is 2.7 in  (2700 in         ), but its

specific gravity is 2.7, regardless of the unit of density. Specific gravity is a particularly useful quantity with regard to

buoyancy, which we will discuss later in this chapter.

Pressure

You have no doubt heard the word `pressure' used in relation to blood (high or low blood pressure) and in relation to
weather (high- and low-pressure weather systems). These are only two of many examples of pressure in fluids.
(Recall that we introduced the idea of pressure in Static Equilibrium and Elasticity, in the context of bulk stress and
strain.)

PRESSURE

Pressure (p) is defined as the normal force F per unit area A over which the force is applied, or

                                                                                                                14.3

To define the pressure at a specific point, the pressure is defined as the force dF exerted by a fluid over an

infinitesimal element of area dA containing the point, resulting in     .

A given force can have a significantly different effect, depending on the area over which the force is exerted. For

instance, a force applied to an area of  has a pressure that is 100 times as great as the same force applied to

an area of  That is why a sharp needle is able to poke through skin when a small force is exerted, but applying

the same force with a finger does not puncture the skin (Figure 14.5).

FIGURE 14.5 (a) A person being poked with a finger might be irritated, but the force has little lasting effect. (b) In contrast, the same force
applied to an area the size of the sharp end of a needle is enough to break the skin.

Note that although force is a vector, pressure is a scalar. Pressure is a scalar quantity because it is defined to be
proportional to the magnitude of the force acting perpendicular to the surface area. The SI unit for pressure is the
pascal (Pa), named after the French mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), where

Several other units are used for pressure, which we discuss later in the chapter.

Variation of pressure with depth in a fluid of constant density
Pressure is defined for all states of matter, but it is particularly important when discussing fluids. An important
characteristic of fluids is that there is no significant resistance to the component of a force applied parallel to the
658  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     surface of a fluid. The molecules of the fluid simply flow to accommodate the horizontal force. A force applied
     perpendicular to the surface compresses or expands the fluid. If you try to compress a fluid, you find that a reaction
     force develops at each point inside the fluid in the outward direction, balancing the force applied on the molecules
     at the boundary.

     Consider a fluid of constant density as shown in Figure 14.6. The pressure at the bottom of the container is due to
     the pressure of the atmosphere plus the pressure due to the weight of the fluid. The pressure due to the fluid is
     equal to the weight of the fluid divided by the area. The weight of the fluid is equal to its mass times the acceleration
     due to gravity.

     FIGURE 14.6 The bottom of this container supports the entire weight of the fluid in it. The vertical sides cannot exert an upward force on
     the fluid (since it cannot withstand a shearing force), so the bottom must support it all.

     Since the density is constant, the weight can be calculated using the density:

     The pressure at the bottom of the container is therefore equal to atmospheric pressure added to the weight of the
     fluid divided by the area:

     This equation is only good for pressure at a depth for a fluid of constant density.

     PRESSURE AT A DEPTH FOR A FLUID OF CONSTANT DENSITY

     The pressure at a depth in a fluid of constant density is equal to the pressure of the atmosphere plus the
     pressure due to the weight of the fluid, or

                                                                                                                 14.4

What Force Must a Dam Withstand?

Consider the pressure and force acting on the dam retaining a reservoir of water (Figure 14.7). Suppose the dam is
500-m wide and the water is 80.0-m deep at the dam, as illustrated below. (a) What is the average pressure on the
dam due to the water? (b) Calculate the force exerted against the dam.

The average pressure p due to the weight of the water is the pressure at the average depth h of 40.0 m, since
pressure increases linearly with depth. The force exerted on the dam by the water is the average pressure times the
area of contact,

Although this force seems large, it is small compared with the
fact, it is only 0.0800% of the weight.

If the reservoir in Example 14.1 covered twice the area, but was kept to the same depth, would the dam need to be
redesigned?

Pressure in a static fluid in a uniform gravitational field
A static fluid is a fluid that is not in motion. At any point within a static fluid, the pressure on all sides must be
equal--otherwise, the fluid at that point would react to a net force and accelerate.
660  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     The pressure at any point in a static fluid depends only on the depth at that point. As discussed, pressure in a fluid
     near Earth varies with depth due to the weight of fluid above a particular level. In the above examples, we assumed
     density to be constant and the average density of the fluid to be a good representation of the density. This is a
     reasonable approximation for liquids like water, where large forces are required to compress the liquid or change
     the volume. In a swimming pool, for example, the density is approximately constant, and the water at the bottom is
     compressed very little by the weight of the water on top. Traveling up in the atmosphere is quite a different
     situation, however. The density of the air begins to change significantly just a short distance above Earth's surface.

     To derive a formula for the variation of pressure with depth in a tank containing a fluid of density  on the surface of
     Earth, we must start with the assumption that the density of the fluid is not constant. Fluid located at deeper levels
     is subjected to more force than fluid nearer to the surface due to the weight of the fluid above it. Therefore, the
     pressure calculated at a given depth is different than the pressure calculated using a constant density.

     Imagine a thin element of fluid at a depth h, as shown in Figure 14.8. Let the element have a cross-sectional area A

     and height . The forces acting upon the element are due to the pressures p(y) above and   below it. The

     weight of the element itself is also shown in the free-body diagram.

     FIGURE 14.8 Forces on a mass element inside a fluid. The weight of the element itself is shown in the free-body diagram.

     Since the element of fluid between y and  is not accelerating, the forces are balanced. Using a Cartesian

     y-axis oriented up, we find the following equation for the y-component:

                                                                                                                               14.6

     Note that if the element had a non-zero y-component of acceleration, the right-hand side would not be zero but
     would instead be the mass times the y-acceleration. The mass of the element can be written in terms of the density
     of the fluid and the volume of the elements:

                                                                     

     Putting this expression for into Equation 14.6 and then dividing both sides by , we find

                                                                                                                               14.7

     Taking the limit of the infinitesimally thin element  , we obtain the following differential equation, which
     gives the variation of pressure in a fluid:                                                                                 14.8

This equation tells us that the rate of change of pressure in a fluid is proportional to the density of the fluid. The
solution of this equation depends upon whether the density  is constant or changes with depth; that is, the function
(y).

If the range of the depth being analyzed is not too great, we can assume the density to be constant. But if the range
of depth is large enough for the density to vary appreciably, such as in the case of the atmosphere, there is
significant change in density with depth. In that case, we cannot use the approximation of a constant density.

Pressure in a fluid with a constant density
Let's use Equation 14.9 to work out a formula for the pressure at a depth h from the surface in a tank of a liquid such
as water, where the density of the liquid can be taken to be constant.

We need to integrate Equation 14.9 from  where the pressure is atmospheric pressure  to  the
y-coordinate of the depth:                                                               14.9

Hence, pressure at a depth of fluid on the surface of Earth is equal to the atmospheric pressure plus gh if the
density of the fluid is constant over the height, as we found previously.

Note that the pressure in a fluid depends only on the depth from the surface and not on the shape of the container.
Thus, in a container where a fluid can freely move in various parts, the liquid stays at the same level in every part,
regardless of the shape, as shown in Figure 14.9.

FIGURE 14.9 If a fluid can flow freely between parts of a container, it rises to the same height in each part. In the container pictured, the
pressure at the bottom of each column is the same; if it were not the same, the fluid would flow until the pressures became equal.

Variation of atmospheric pressure with height
The change in atmospheric pressure with height is of particular interest. Assuming the temperature of air to be
constant, and that the ideal gas law of thermodynamics describes the atmosphere to a good approximation, we can
find the variation of atmospheric pressure with height, when the temperature is constant. (We discuss the ideal gas
law in a later chapter, but we assume you have some familiarity with it from high school and chemistry.) Let p(y) be
the atmospheric pressure at height y. The density at y, the temperature T in the Kelvin scale (K), and the mass m
662  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     of a molecule of air are related to the absolute pressure by the ideal gas law, in the form

                                                                                                  14.10

     where is Boltzmann's constant, which has a value of     .

     You may have encountered the ideal gas law in the form  , where n is the number of moles and R is the

     gas constant. Here, the same law has been written in a different form, using the density instead of volume V.

     Therefore, if pressure p changes with height, so does the density Using density from the ideal gas law, the rate of

     variation of pressure with height is given as

     where constant quantities have been collected inside the parentheses. Replacing these constants with a single
     symbol the equation looks much simpler:

     This gives the solution

     Thus, atmospheric pressure drops exponentially with height, since the y-axis is pointed up from the ground and y
     has positive values in the atmosphere above sea level. The pressure drops by a factor of when the height is
     which gives us a physical interpretation for : The constant is a length scale that characterizes how pressure
     varies with height and is often referred to as the pressure scale height.

     We can obtain an approximate value of by using the mass of a nitrogen molecule as a proxy for an air molecule. At

     temperature           or 300 K, we find

     Therefore, for every 8800 meters, the air pressure drops by a factor 1/e, or approximately one-third of its value. This
     gives us only a rough estimate of the actual situation, since we have assumed both a constant temperature and a
     constant g over such great distances from Earth, neither of which is correct in reality.

     Direction of pressure in a fluid
     Fluid pressure has no direction, being a scalar quantity, whereas the forces due to pressure have well-defined
     directions: They are always exerted perpendicular to any surface. The reason is that fluids cannot withstand or exert
     shearing forces. Thus, in a static fluid enclosed in a tank, the force exerted on the walls of the tank is exerted
     perpendicular to the inside surface. Likewise, pressure is exerted perpendicular to the surfaces of any object within
     the fluid. Figure 14.10 illustrates the pressure exerted by air on the walls of a tire and by water on the body of a
     swimmer.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define gauge pressure and absolute pressure
    · Explain various methods for measuring pressure
    · Understand the working of open-tube barometers
    · Describe in detail how manometers and barometers operate

In the preceding section, we derived a formula for calculating the variation in pressure for a fluid in hydrostatic
equilibrium. As it turns out, this is a very useful calculation. Measurements of pressure are important in daily life as
well as in science and engineering applications. In this section, we discuss different ways that pressure can be
reported and measured.

Gauge Pressure vs. Absolute Pressure

Suppose the pressure gauge on a full scuba tank reads 3000 psi, which is approximately 207 atmospheres. When
the valve is opened, air begins to escape because the pressure inside the tank is greater than the atmospheric
pressure outside the tank. Air continues to escape from the tank until the pressure inside the tank equals the
pressure of the atmosphere outside the tank. At this point, the pressure gauge on the tank reads zero, even though
the pressure inside the tank is actually 1 atmosphere--the same as the air pressure outside the tank.

Most pressure gauges, like the one on the scuba tank, are calibrated to read zero at atmospheric pressure. Pressure
readings from such gauges are called gauge pressure, which is the pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure.
When the pressure inside the tank is greater than atmospheric pressure, the gauge reports a positive value.

Some gauges are designed to measure negative pressure. For example, many physics experiments must take place
in a vacuum chamber, a rigid chamber from which some of the air is pumped out. The pressure inside the vacuum
chamber is less than atmospheric pressure, so the pressure gauge on the chamber reads a negative value.

Unlike gauge pressure, absolute pressure accounts for atmospheric pressure, which in effect adds to the pressure
in any fluid not enclosed in a rigid container.

ABSOLUTE PRESSURE

The absolute pressure, or total pressure, is the sum of gauge pressure and atmospheric pressure:

                                                                                                  14.11
664  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     where        is absolute pressure, is gauge pressure, and    is atmospheric pressure.

     For example, if a tire gauge reads 34 psi, then the absolute pressure is 34 psi plus 14.7 psi (  in psi), or 48.7 psi
     (equivalent to 336 kPa).

     In most cases, the absolute pressure in fluids cannot be negative. Fluids push rather than pull, so the smallest

     absolute pressure in a fluid is zero (a negative absolute pressure is a pull). Thus, the smallest possible gauge

     pressure is           (which makes zero). There is no theoretical limit to how large a gauge pressure can be.

     Measuring Pressure

     A host of devices are used for measuring pressure, ranging from tire gauges to blood pressure monitors. Many other
     types of pressure gauges are commonly used to test the pressure of fluids, such as mechanical pressure gauges. We
     will explore some of these in this section.

     Any property that changes with pressure in a known way can be used to construct a pressure gauge. Some of the
     most common types include strain gauges, which use the change in the shape of a material with pressure;
     capacitance pressure gauges, which use the change in electric capacitance due to shape change with pressure;
     piezoelectric pressure gauges, which generate a voltage difference across a piezoelectric material under a pressure
     difference between the two sides; and ion gauges, which measure pressure by ionizing molecules in highly
     evacuated chambers. Different pressure gauges are useful in different pressure ranges and under different physical
     situations. Some examples are shown in Figure 14.11.

     FIGURE 14.11 (a) Gauges are used to measure and monitor pressure in gas cylinders. Compressed gases are used in many industrial as
     well as medical applications. (b) Tire pressure gauges come in many different models, but all are meant for the same purpose: to measure
     the internal pressure of the tire. This enables the driver to keep the tires inflated at optimal pressure for load weight and driving conditions.
     (c) An ionization gauge is a high-sensitivity device used to monitor the pressure of gases in an enclosed system. Neutral gas molecules are
     ionized by the release of electrons, and the current is translated into a pressure reading. Ionization gauges are commonly used in industrial
     applications that rely on vacuum systems.

     Manometers

     One of the most important classes of pressure gauges applies the property that pressure due to the weight of a fluid

     of constant density is given by           . The U-shaped tube shown in Figure 14.12 is an example of a manometer; in

     part (a), both sides of the tube are open to the atmosphere, allowing atmospheric pressure to push down on each

     side equally so that its effects cancel.

     A manometer with only one side open to the atmosphere is an ideal device for measuring gauge pressures. The

     gauge pressure is                and is found by measuring h. For example, suppose one side of the U-tube is connected

     to some source of pressure       such as the balloon in part (b) of the figure or the vacuum-packed peanut jar shown

     in part (c). Pressure is transmitted undiminished to the manometer, and the fluid levels are no longer equal. In part

     (b), is greater than atmospheric pressure, whereas in part (c), is less than atmospheric pressure. In both

     cases,       differs from atmospheric pressure by an amount  where is the density of the fluid in the

     manometer. In part (b), can support a column of fluid of height h, so it must exert a pressure greater than

     atmospheric pressure (the gauge pressure is positive). In part (c), atmospheric pressure can support a column of

     fluid of height h, so is less than atmospheric pressure by an amount (the gauge pressure is negative).

FIGURE 14.12 An open-tube manometer has one side open to the atmosphere. (a) Fluid depth must be the same on both sides, or the
pressure each side exerts at the bottom will be unequal and liquid will flow from the deeper side. (b) A positive gauge pressure

transmitted to one side of the manometer can support a column of fluid of height h. (c) Similarly, atmospheric pressure is greater than a
negative gauge pressure by an amount . The jar's rigidity prevents atmospheric pressure from being transmitted to the peanuts.

Barometers

Manometers typically use a U-shaped tube of a fluid (often mercury) to measure pressure. A barometer (see Figure

14.13) is a device that typically uses a single column of mercury to measure atmospheric pressure. The barometer,

invented by the Italian mathematician and physicist Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647) in 1643, is constructed from

a glass tube closed at one end and filled with mercury. The tube is then inverted and placed in a pool of mercury.

This device measures atmospheric pressure, rather than gauge pressure, because there is a nearly pure vacuum

above the mercury in the tube. The height of the mercury is such that  . When atmospheric pressure

varies, the mercury rises or falls.

Weather forecasters closely monitor changes in atmospheric pressure (often reported as barometric pressure), as
rising mercury typically signals improving weather and falling mercury indicates deteriorating weather. The
barometer can also be used as an altimeter, since average atmospheric pressure varies with altitude. Mercury
barometers and manometers are so common that units of mm Hg are often quoted for atmospheric pressure and
blood pressures.

     Fluid Heights in an Open U-Tube

     A U-tube with both ends open is filled with a liquid of density to a height h on both sides (Figure 14.14). A liquid

     of density            is poured into one side and Liquid 2 settles on top of Liquid 1. The heights on the two sides are

     different. The height to the top of Liquid 2 from the interface is and the height to the top of Liquid 1 from the level

     of the interface is . Derive a formula for the height difference.

                                                   FIGURE 14.14 Two liquids of different densities are shown in a U-tube.

     Strategy
     The pressure at points at the same height on the two sides of a U-tube must be the same as long as the two points
     are in the same liquid. Therefore, we consider two points at the same level in the two arms of the tube: One point is
     the interface on the side of the Liquid 2 and the other is a point in the arm with Liquid 1 that is at the same level as
     the interface in the other arm. The pressure at each point is due to atmospheric pressure plus the weight of the
     liquid above it.

     Solution
     Since the two points are in Liquid 1 and are at the same height, the pressure at the two points must be the same.
     Therefore, we have

     Hence,

     This means that the difference in heights on the two sides of the U-tube is

     The result makes sense if we set  which gives                      If the two sides have the same density, they have
     the same height.

Units of pressure
As stated earlier, the SI unit for pressure is the pascal (Pa), where

In addition to the pascal, many other units for pressure are in common use (Table 14.3). In meteorology,
atmospheric pressure is often described in the unit of millibars (mbar), where

The millibar is a convenient unit for meteorologists because the average atmospheric pressure at sea level on Earth

is                           . Using the equations derived when considering pressure at a depth in a

fluid, pressure can also be measured as millimeters or inches of mercury. The pressure at the bottom of a 760-mm

column of mercury at  in a container where the top part is evacuated is equal to the atmospheric pressure.

Thus, 760 mm Hg is also used in place of 1 atmosphere of pressure. In vacuum physics labs, scientists often use

another unit called the torr, named after Torricelli, who, as we have just seen, invented the mercury manometer for

measuring pressure. One torr is equal to a pressure of 1 mm Hg.

14.3 Pascal's Principle and Hydraulics

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · State Pascal's principle
    · Describe applications of Pascal's principle
    · Derive relationships between forces in a hydraulic system

In 1653, the French philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal published his Treatise on the Equilibrium of Liquids, in
which he discussed principles of static fluids. A static fluid is a fluid that is not in motion. When a fluid is not flowing,
we say that the fluid is in static equilibrium. If the fluid is water, we say it is in hydrostatic equilibrium. For a fluid in
static equilibrium, the net force on any part of the fluid must be zero; otherwise the fluid will start to flow.

Pascal's observations--since proven experimentally--provide the foundation for hydraulics, one of the most
important developments in modern mechanical technology. Pascal observed that a change in pressure applied to an
enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid and to the walls of its container. Because of this, we
often know more about pressure than other physical quantities in fluids. Moreover, Pascal's principle implies that
the total pressure in a fluid is the sum of the pressures from different sources. A good example is the fluid at a depth
668  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     depends on the depth of the fluid and the pressure of the atmosphere.

     Pascal's Principle

     Pascal's principle (also known as Pascal's law) states that when a change in pressure is applied to an enclosed
     fluid, it is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and to the walls of its container. In an enclosed fluid,
     since atoms of the fluid are free to move about, they transmit pressure to all parts of the fluid and to the walls of the
     container. Any change in pressure is transmitted undiminished.

     Note that this principle does not say that the pressure is the same at all points of a fluid--which is not true, since the
     pressure in a fluid near Earth varies with height. Rather, this principle applies to the change in pressure. Suppose
     you place some water in a cylindrical container of height H and cross-sectional area A that has a movable piston of
     mass m (Figure 14.15). Adding weight Mg at the top of the piston increases the pressure at the top by Mg/A, since
     the additional weight also acts over area A of the lid:

     FIGURE 14.15 Pressure in a fluid changes when the fluid is compressed. (a) The pressure at the top layer of the fluid is different from
     pressure at the bottom layer. (b) The increase in pressure by adding weight to the piston is the same everywhere, for example,

                                                           .

     According to Pascal's principle, the pressure at all points in the water changes by the same amount, Mg/A. Thus, the
     pressure at the bottom also increases by Mg/A. The pressure at the bottom of the container is equal to the sum of
     the atmospheric pressure, the pressure due to the fluid, and the pressure supplied by the mass. The change in
     pressure at the bottom of the container due to the mass is

     Since the pressure changes are the same everywhere in the fluid, we no longer need subscripts to designate the
     pressure change for top or bottom:

     Applications of Pascal's Principle and Hydraulic Systems

     Hydraulic systems are used to operate automotive brakes, hydraulic jacks, and numerous other mechanical systems
     (Figure 14.16).

FIGURE 14.16 A typical hydraulic system with two fluid-filled cylinders, capped with pistons and connected by a tube called a hydraulic
line. A downward force on the left piston creates a change in pressure that is transmitted undiminished to all parts of the enclosed fluid.
This results in an upward force on the right piston that is larger than because the right piston has a larger surface area.

We can derive a relationship between the forces in this simple hydraulic system by applying Pascal's principle. Note
first that the two pistons in the system are at the same height, so there is no difference in pressure due to a
difference in depth. The pressure due to acting on area is simply

According to Pascal's principle, this pressure is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid and to all walls of the

container. Thus, a pressure is felt at the other piston that is equal to . That is,  However,

since  we see that

                                                                                               14.12

This equation relates the ratios of force to area in any hydraulic system, provided that the pistons are at the same
vertical height and that friction in the system is negligible.

Hydraulic systems can increase or decrease the force applied to them. To make the force larger, the pressure is
applied to a larger area. For example, if a 100-N force is applied to the left cylinder in Figure 14.16 and the right
cylinder has an area five times greater, then the output force is 500 N. Hydraulic systems are analogous to simple
levers, but they have the advantage that pressure can be sent through tortuously curved lines to several places at
once.

The hydraulic jack is such a hydraulic system. A hydraulic jack is used to lift heavy loads, such as the ones used by
auto mechanics to raise an automobile. It consists of an incompressible fluid in a U-tube fitted with a movable
piston on each side. One side of the U-tube is narrower than the other. A small force applied over a small area can
balance a much larger force on the other side over a larger area (Figure 14.17).

     can be performed. (credit b: modification of work by Jane Whitney)

     From Pascal's principle, it can be shown that the force needed to lift the car is less than the weight of the car:

     Calculating Force on Wheel Cylinders: Pascal Puts on the Brakes

     Consider the automobile hydraulic system shown in Figure 14.18. Suppose a force of 100 N is applied to the brake
     pedal, which acts on the pedal cylinder (acting as a "master" cylinder) through a lever. A force of 500 N is exerted on
     the pedal cylinder. Pressure created in the pedal cylinder is transmitted to the four wheel cylinders. The pedal
     cylinder has a diameter of 0.500 cm and each wheel cylinder has a diameter of 2.50 cm. Calculate the magnitude of
     the force created at each of the wheel cylinders.

This value is the force exerted by each of the four wheel cylinders. Note that we can add as many wheel cylinders as

we wish. If each has a 2.50-cm diameter, each will exert  A simple hydraulic system, as an example

of a simple machine, can increase force but cannot do more work than is done on it. Work is force times distance

moved, and the wheel cylinder moves through a smaller distance than the pedal cylinder. Furthermore, the more

wheels added, the smaller the distance each one moves. Many hydraulic systems--such as power brakes and those

in bulldozers--have a motorized pump that actually does most of the work in the system.

     14.4 Archimedes' Principle and Buoyancy

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define buoyant force
         · State Archimedes' principle
         · Describe the relationship between density and Archimedes' principle

     When placed in a fluid, some objects float due to a buoyant force. Where does this buoyant force come from? Why is
     it that some things float and others do not? Do objects that sink get any support at all from the fluid? Is your body
     buoyed by the atmosphere, or are only helium balloons affected (Figure 14.19)?

     FIGURE 14.19 (a) Even objects that sink, like this anchor, are partly supported by water when submerged. (b) Submarines have adjustable
     density (ballast tanks) so that they may float or sink as desired. (c) Helium-filled balloons tug upward on their strings, demonstrating air's
     buoyant effect. (credit b: modification of work by Allied Navy; credit c: modification of work by "Crystl"/Flickr)

     Answers to all these questions, and many others, are based on the fact that pressure increases with depth in a fluid.
     This means that the upward force on the bottom of an object in a fluid is greater than the downward force on top of
     the object. There is an upward force, or buoyant force, on any object in any fluid (Figure 14.20). If the buoyant force
     is greater than the object's weight, the net force on the object is upward. If we release such an object, it will rise in
     the fluid. If the buoyant force is less than the object's weight, the object sinks when released. If the buoyant force
     equals the object's weight, the object can remain suspended at its present depth, either immersed in the fluid (as
     for a neutrally buoyant diver) or partly above the surface (as with a floating object.) If the buoyant force equals the
     object's weight, the object can remain suspended at its present depth. The buoyant force is always present, whether
     the object floats, sinks, or is suspended in a fluid.

FIGURE 14.20 Pressure due to the weight of a fluid increases with depth because  . This change in pressure and associated upward

force on the bottom of the cylinder are greater than the downward force on the top of the cylinder. The differences in the force results in the

buoyant force . (Horizontal forces cancel.)

Archimedes' Principle

Just how large a force is buoyant force? To answer this question, think about what happens when a submerged
object is removed from a fluid, as in Figure 14.21. If the object were not in the fluid, the space the object occupied
would be filled by fluid having a weight This weight is supported by the surrounding fluid, so the buoyant force
must equal the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

ARCHIMEDES' PRINCIPLE

The buoyant force on an object equals the weight of the fluid it displaces. In equation form, Archimedes'
principle is

  where is the buoyant force and is the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

This principle is named after the Greek mathematician and inventor Archimedes (ca. 287-212 BCE), who stated this
principle long before concepts of force were well established.

FIGURE 14.21 (a) An object submerged in a fluid experiences a buoyant force If is greater than the weight of the object, the object
rises. If is less than the weight of the object, the object sinks. (b) If the object is removed, it is replaced by fluid having weight Since
this weight is supported by surrounding fluid, the buoyant force must equal the weight of the fluid displaced.
674  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     Archimedes' principle refers to the force of buoyancy that results when a body is submerged in a fluid, whether
     partially or wholly. The force that provides the pressure of a fluid acts on a body perpendicular to the surface of the
     body. In other words, the force due to the pressure at the bottom is pointed up, while at the top, the force due to the
     pressure is pointed down; the forces due to the pressures at the sides are pointing into the body.

     Since the bottom of the body is at a greater depth than the top of the body, the pressure at the lower part of the
     body is higher than the pressure at the upper part, as shown in Figure 14.20. Therefore a net upward force acts on
     the body. This upward force is the force of buoyancy, or simply buoyancy.

          INTERACTIVE

     The exclamation "Eureka" (meaning "I found it") has often been credited to Archimedes as he made the discovery
     that would lead to Archimedes' principle. Some say it all started in a bathtub. To hear this story, watch this video
     (https://openstax.org/l/21archNASA) or explore Scientific American (https://openstax.org/l/21archsciamer) to learn
     more.

     Density and Archimedes' Principle

     If you drop a lump of clay in water, it will sink. But if you mold the same lump of clay into the shape of a boat, it will
     float. Because of its shape, the clay boat displaces more water than the lump and experiences a greater buoyant
     force, even though its mass is the same. The same is true of steel ships.

     The average density of an object is what ultimately determines whether it floats. If an object's average density is
     less than that of the surrounding fluid, it will float. The reason is that the fluid, having a higher density, contains
     more mass and hence more weight in the same volume. The buoyant force, which equals the weight of the fluid
     displaced, is thus greater than the weight of the object. Likewise, an object denser than the fluid will sink.

     The extent to which a floating object is submerged depends on how the object's density compares to the density of
     the fluid. In Figure 14.22, for example, the unloaded ship has a lower density and less of it is submerged compared
     with the same ship when loaded. We can derive a quantitative expression for the fraction submerged by considering
     density. The fraction submerged is the ratio of the volume submerged to the volume of the object, or

     The volume submerged equals the volume of fluid displaced, which we call  . Now we can obtain the relationship

     between the densities by substituting  into the expression. This gives

     where is the average density of the object and is the density of the fluid. Since the object floats, its mass and
     that of the displaced fluid are equal, so they cancel from the equation, leaving

     We can use this relationship to measure densities.

What is her average density?
Strategy
We can find the woman's density by solving the equation

for the density of the object. This yields

We know both the fraction submerged and the density of water, so we can calculate the woman's density.
Solution
Entering the known values into the expression for her density, we obtain

Significance
The woman's density is less than the fluid density. We expect this because she floats.

Numerous lower-density objects or substances float in higher-density fluids: oil on water, a hot-air balloon in the
atmosphere, a bit of cork in wine, an iceberg in salt water, and hot wax in a "lava lamp," to name a few. A less
obvious example is mountain ranges floating on the higher-density crust and mantle beneath them. Even seemingly
solid Earth has fluid characteristics.

Measuring Density

One of the most common techniques for determining density is shown in Figure 14.23.
676  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     FIGURE 14.23 (a) A coin is weighed in air. (b) The apparent weight of the coin is determined while it is completely submerged in a fluid of
     known density. These two measurements are used to calculate the density of the coin.

     An object, here a coin, is weighed in air and then weighed again while submerged in a liquid. The density of the coin,
     an indication of its authenticity, can be calculated if the fluid density is known. We can use this same technique to
     determine the density of the fluid if the density of the coin is known.
     All of these calculations are based on Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force on the object
     equals the weight of the fluid displaced. This, in turn, means that the object appears to weigh less when submerged;
     we call this measurement the object's apparent weight. The object suffers an apparent weight loss equal to the
     weight of the fluid displaced. Alternatively, on balances that measure mass, the object suffers an apparent mass
     loss equal to the mass of fluid displaced. That is, apparent weight loss equals weight of fluid displaced, or apparent
     mass loss equals mass of fluid displaced.

     The first part of this chapter dealt with fluid statics, the study of fluids at rest. The rest of this chapter deals with
     fluid dynamics, the study of fluids in motion. Even the most basic forms of fluid motion can be quite complex. For
     this reason, we limit our investigation to ideal fluids in many of the examples. An ideal fluid is a fluid with negligible
     viscosity. Viscosity is a measure of the internal friction in a fluid; we examine it in more detail in Viscosity and
     Turbulence. In a few examples, we examine an incompressible fluid--one for which an extremely large force is
     required to change the volume--since the density in an incompressible fluid is constant throughout.

     Characteristics of Flow

     Velocity vectors are often used to illustrate fluid motion in applications like meteorology. For example, wind--the
     fluid motion of air in the atmosphere--can be represented by vectors indicating the speed and direction of the wind
     at any given point on a map. Figure 14.24 shows velocity vectors describing the winds during Hurricane Arthur in
     2014.

Another method for representing fluid motion is a streamline. A streamline represents the path of a small volume of
fluid as it flows. The velocity is always tangential to the streamline. The diagrams in Figure 14.25 use streamlines to
illustrate two examples of fluids moving through a pipe. The first fluid exhibits a laminar flow (sometimes described
as a steady flow), represented by smooth, parallel streamlines. Note that in the example shown in part (a), the
velocity of the fluid is greatest in the center and decreases near the walls of the pipe due to the viscosity of the fluid
and friction between the pipe walls and the fluid. This is a special case of laminar flow, where the friction between
the pipe and the fluid is high, known as no slip boundary conditions. The second diagram represents turbulent flow,
in which streamlines are irregular and change over time. In turbulent flow, the paths of the fluid flow are irregular as
different parts of the fluid mix together or form small circular regions that resemble whirlpools. This can occur when
the speed of the fluid reaches a certain critical speed.

FIGURE 14.25 (a) Laminar flow can be thought of as layers of fluid moving in parallel, regular paths. (b) In turbulent flow, regions of fluid
move in irregular, colliding paths, resulting in mixing and swirling.

Flow Rate and its Relation to Velocity

The volume of fluid passing by a given location through an area during a period of time is called flow rate Q, or more
precisely, volume flow rate. In symbols, this is written as

                                                                                                                                                   14.13
678  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     where V is the volume and t is the elapsed time. In Figure 14.26, the volume of the cylinder is Ax, so the flow rate is

     FIGURE 14.26 Flow rate is the volume of fluid flowing past a point through the area A per unit time. Here, the shaded cylinder of fluid flows
     past point P in a uniform pipe in time t.

     The SI unit for flow rate is     but several other units for Q are in common use, such as liters per minute (L/min).

     Note that a liter (L) is 1/1000 of a cubic meter or 1000 cubic centimeters

     Flow rate and velocity are related, but quite different, physical quantities. To make the distinction clear, consider the
     flow rate of a river. The greater the velocity of the water, the greater the flow rate of the river. But flow rate also
     depends on the size and shape of the river. A rapid mountain stream carries far less water than the Amazon River in

     Brazil, for example. Figure 14.26 illustrates the volume flow rate. The volume flow rate is               where

     is the cross-sectional area of the pipe and v is the magnitude of the velocity.

     The precise relationship between flow rate Q and average speed v is

     where A is the cross-sectional area and is the average speed. The relationship tells us that flow rate is directly

     proportional to both the average speed of the fluid and the cross-sectional area of a river, pipe, or other conduit. The

     larger the conduit, the greater its cross-sectional area. Figure 14.26 illustrates how this relationship is obtained. The

     shaded cylinder has a volume     , which flows past the point P in a time t. Dividing both sides of this

     relationship by t gives

     We note that             and the average speed is  . Thus the equation becomes               .

     Figure 14.27 shows an incompressible fluid flowing along a pipe of decreasing radius. Because the fluid is
     incompressible, the same amount of fluid must flow past any point in the tube in a given time to ensure continuity of
     flow. The flow is continuous because they are no sources or sinks that add or remove mass, so the mass flowing into
     the pipe must be equal the mass flowing out of the pipe. In this case, because the cross-sectional area of the pipe
     decreases, the velocity must necessarily increase. This logic can be extended to say that the flow rate must be the
     same at all points along the pipe. In particular, for arbitrary points 1 and 2,

                                                                                                               14.14

     This is called the equation of continuity and is valid for any incompressible fluid (with constant density). The
     consequences of the equation of continuity can be observed when water flows from a hose into a narrow spray
     nozzle: It emerges with a large speed--that is the purpose of the nozzle. Conversely, when a river empties into one
     end of a reservoir, the water slows considerably, perhaps picking up speed again when it leaves the other end of the
     reservoir. In other words, speed increases when cross-sectional area decreases, and speed decreases when cross-
     sectional area increases.

FIGURE 14.27 When a tube narrows, the same volume occupies a greater length. For the same volume to pass points 1 and 2 in a given
time, the speed must be greater at point 2. The process is exactly reversible. If the fluid flows in the opposite direction, its speed decreases
when the tube widens. (Note that the relative volumes of the two cylinders and the corresponding velocity vector arrows are not drawn to
scale.)

Since liquids are essentially incompressible, the equation of continuity is valid for all liquids. However, gases are
compressible, so the equation must be applied with caution to gases if they are subjected to compression or
expansion.

EXAMPLE 14.5

Calculating Fluid Speed through a Nozzle

A nozzle with a diameter of 0.500 cm is attached to a garden hose with a radius of 0.900 cm. The flow rate through
hose and nozzle is 0.500 L/s. Calculate the speed of the water (a) in the hose and (b) in the nozzle.

Strategy
We can use the relationship between flow rate and speed to find both speeds. We use the subscript 1 for the hose
and 2 for the nozzle.

Solution

a. We solve the flow rate equation for speed and use  for the cross-sectional area of the hose, obtaining

Substituting values and using appropriate unit conversions yields

b. We could repeat this calculation to find the speed in the nozzle  , but we use the equation of continuity to
     give a somewhat different insight. The equation states

Solving for and substituting for the cross-sectional area yields

        Substituting known values,

Significance
A speed of 1.96 m/s is about right for water emerging from a hose with no nozzle. The nozzle produces a
considerably faster stream merely by constricting the flow to a narrower tube.
The solution to the last part of the example shows that speed is inversely proportional to the square of the radius of
the tube, making for large effects when radius varies. We can blow out a candle at quite a distance, for example, by
680  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     pursing our lips, whereas blowing on a candle with our mouth wide open is quite ineffective.

     Mass Conservation

     The rate of flow of a fluid can also be described by the mass flow rate or mass rate of flow. This is the rate at which a
     mass of the fluid moves past a point. Refer once again to Figure 14.26, but this time consider the mass in the
     shaded volume. The mass can be determined from the density and the volume:

     The mass flow rate is then

     where is the density, A is the cross-sectional area, and v is the magnitude of the velocity. The mass flow rate is an
     important quantity in fluid dynamics and can be used to solve many problems. Consider Figure 14.27. The pipe in
     the figure starts at the inlet with a cross sectional area of and constricts to an outlet with a smaller cross
     sectional area of . The mass of fluid entering the pipe has to be equal to the mass of fluid leaving the pipe. For
     this reason the velocity at the outlet is greater than the velocity of the inlet . Using the fact that the mass of
     fluid entering the pipe must be equal to the mass of fluid exiting the pipe, we can find a relationship between the
     velocity and the cross-sectional area by taking the rate of change of the mass in and the mass out:

                                                                                                                                                        14.15

     Equation 14.15 is also known as the continuity equation in general form. If the density of the fluid remains constant
     through the constriction--that is, the fluid is incompressible--then the density cancels from the continuity equation,

     The equation reduces to show that the volume flow rate into the pipe equals the volume flow rate out of the pipe.

     14.6 Bernoulli's Equation

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the terms in Bernoulli's equation
         · Explain how Bernoulli's equation is related to the conservation of energy
         · Describe how to derive Bernoulli's principle from Bernoulli's equation
         · Perform calculations using Bernoulli's principle
         · Describe some applications of Bernoulli's principle

     As we showed in Figure 14.27, when a fluid flows into a narrower channel, its speed increases. That means its
     kinetic energy also increases. The increased kinetic energy comes from the net work done on the fluid to push it into
     the channel. Also, if the fluid changes vertical position, work is done on the fluid by the gravitational force.

     A pressure difference occurs when the channel narrows. This pressure difference results in a net force on the fluid
     because the pressure times the area equals the force, and this net force does work. Recall the work-energy
     theorem,

     Access for free at openstax.org
14.6 · Bernoulli's Equation                                                                                                            681

The net work done increases the fluid's kinetic energy. As a result, the pressure drops in a rapidly moving fluid
whether or not the fluid is confined to a tube.

There are many common examples of pressure dropping in rapidly moving fluids. For instance, shower curtains have
a disagreeable habit of bulging into the shower stall when the shower is on. The reason is that the high-velocity
stream of water and air creates a region of lower pressure inside the shower, whereas the pressure on the other side
remains at the standard atmospheric pressure. This pressure difference results in a net force, pushing the curtain
inward. Similarly, when a car passes a truck on the highway, the two vehicles seem to pull toward each other. The
reason is the same: The high velocity of the air between the car and the truck creates a region of lower pressure
between the vehicles, and they are pushed together by greater pressure on the outside (Figure 14.29). This effect
was observed as far back as the mid-1800s, when it was found that trains passing in opposite directions tipped
precariously toward one another.

outside pushes the car and truck together.

Energy Conservation and Bernoulli's Equation

The application of the principle of conservation of energy to frictionless laminar flow leads to a very useful relation
between pressure and flow speed in a fluid. This relation is called Bernoulli's equation, named after Daniel
Bernoulli (1700-1782), who published his studies on fluid motion in his book Hydrodynamica (1738).

Consider an incompressible fluid flowing through a pipe that has a varying diameter and height, as shown in Figure
14.30. Subscripts 1 and 2 in the figure denote two locations along the pipe and illustrate the relationships between
the areas of the cross sections A, the speed of flow v, the height from ground y, and the pressure p at each point. We
assume here that the density at the two points is the same--therefore, density is denoted by without any
subscripts--and since the fluid is incompressible, the shaded volumes must be equal.

                                           FIGURE 14.30 The geometry used for the derivation of Bernoulli's equation.

We also assume that there are no viscous forces in the fluid, so the energy of any part of the fluid will be conserved.
682  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     To derive Bernoulli's equation, we first calculate the work that was done on the fluid:

     The work done was due to the conservative force of gravity and the change in the kinetic energy of the fluid. The
     change in the kinetic energy of the fluid is equal to

     The change in potential energy is
     The energy equation then becomes

     Rearranging the equation gives Bernoulli's equation:

     This relation states that the mechanical energy of any part of the fluid changes as a result of the work done by the
     fluid external to that part, due to varying pressure along the way. Since the two points were chosen arbitrarily, we
     can write Bernoulli's equation more generally as a conservation principle along the flow.

       BERNOULLI'S EQUATION

       For an incompressible, frictionless fluid, the combination of pressure and the sum of kinetic and potential energy
       densities is constant not only over time, but also along a streamline:

                                                                                                                                                     14.16

     A special note must be made here of the fact that in a dynamic situation, the pressures at the same height in
     different parts of the fluid may be different if they have different speeds of flow.

     Analyzing Bernoulli's Equation

     According to Bernoulli's equation, if we follow a small volume of fluid along its path, various quantities in the sum
     may change, but the total remains constant. Bernoulli's equation is, in fact, just a convenient statement of
     conservation of energy for an incompressible fluid in the absence of friction.

     The general form of Bernoulli's equation has three terms in it, and it is broadly applicable. To understand it better, let
     us consider some specific situations that simplify and illustrate its use and meaning.

     Bernoulli's equation for static fluids                                                   Bernoulli's equation in that

     case is

     We can further simplify the equation by setting       (Any height can be chosen for a reference height of zero, as

     is often done for other situations involving gravitational force, making all other heights relative.) In this case, we get

     This equation tells us that, in static fluids, pressure increases with depth. As we go from point 1 to point 2 in the

case, is zero at the top of the fluid, and we get the familiar relationship  .  and

                 Thus, Bernoulli's equation confirms the fact that the pressure change due to the weight of a fluid is

fluids earlier.

Suppose a fluid is moving but its depth is constant--that is,
becomes

Situations in which fluid flows at a constant depth are so common that this equation is often also called Bernoulli's
principle, which is simply Bernoulli's equation for fluids at constant depth. (Note again that this applies to a small
volume of fluid as we follow it along its path.) Bernoulli's principle reinforces the fact that pressure drops as speed
increases in a moving fluid: If is greater than in the equation, then must be less than for the equality to
hold.

EXAMPLE 14.6

Calculating Pressure

In Example 14.5, we found that the speed of water in a hose increased from 1.96 m/s to 25.5 m/s going from the
hose to the nozzle. Calculate the pressure in the hose, given that the absolute pressure in the nozzle is

                          (atmospheric, as it must be) and assuming level, frictionless flow.

Strategy
Level flow means constant depth, so Bernoulli's principle applies. We use the subscript 1 for values in the hose and
2 for those in the nozzle. We are thus asked to find .

Solution                           yields
Solving Bernoulli's principle for

Substituting known values,

Significance
This absolute pressure in the hose is greater than in the nozzle, as expected, since v is greater in the nozzle. The
pressure in the nozzle must be atmospheric, because the water emerges into the atmosphere without other
changes in conditions.

Applications of Bernoulli's Principle

Many devices and situations occur in which fluid flows at a constant height and thus can be analyzed with Bernoulli's
principle.

Entrainment
People have long put the Bernoulli principle to work by using reduced pressure in high-velocity fluids to move things
about. With a higher pressure on the outside, the high-velocity fluid forces other fluids into the stream. This process
is called entrainment. Entrainment devices have been in use since ancient times as pumps to raise water to small
heights, as is necessary for draining swamps, fields, or other low-lying areas. Some other devices that use the
concept of entrainment are shown in Figure 14.31.
684  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     FIGURE 14.31 Entrainment devices use increased fluid speed to create low pressures, which then entrain one fluid into another. (a) A
     Bunsen burner uses an adjustable gas nozzle, entraining air for proper combustion. (b) An atomizer uses a squeeze bulb to create a jet of air
     that entrains drops of perfume. Paint sprayers and carburetors use very similar techniques to move their respective liquids. (c) A common
     aspirator uses a high-speed stream of water to create a region of lower pressure. Aspirators may be used as suction pumps in dental and
     surgical situations or for draining a flooded basement or producing a reduced pressure in a vessel. (d) The chimney of a water heater is
     designed to entrain air into the pipe leading through the ceiling.

     Velocity measurement

     Figure 14.32 shows two devices that apply Bernoulli's principle to measure fluid velocity. The manometer in part (a)

     is connected to two tubes that are small enough not to appreciably disturb the flow. The tube facing the oncoming

     fluid creates a dead spot having zero velocity (      ) in front of it, while fluid passing the other tube has velocity

     . This means that Bernoulli's principle as stated in

     becomes

     Thus pressure over the second opening is reduced by   , so the fluid in the manometer rises by h on the side
     connected to the second opening, where

     (Recall that the symbol means "proportional to.") Solving for , we see that

     Part (b) shows a version of this device that is in common use for measuring various fluid velocities; such devices are
     frequently used as air-speed indicators in aircraft.

together and small enough not to disturb the flow. Tube 1 is open at the end facing the flow. A dead spot having zero speed is created there.
Tube 2 has an opening on the side, so the fluid has a speed v across the opening; thus, pressure there drops. The difference in pressure at

the manometer is  , so h is proportional to  (b) This type of velocity measuring device is a Prandtl tube, also known as a pitot

tube.

A fire hose
All preceding applications of Bernoulli's equation involved simplifying conditions, such as constant height or
constant pressure. The next example is a more general application of Bernoulli's equation in which pressure,
velocity, and height all change.

       EXAMPLE 14.7

Calculating Pressure: A Fire Hose Nozzle

Fire hoses used in major structural fires have an inside diameter of 6.40 cm (Figure 14.33). Suppose such a hose

carries a flow of 40.0 L/s, starting at a gauge pressure of  . The hose rises up 10.0 m along a ladder

to a nozzle having an inside diameter of 3.00 cm. What is the pressure in the nozzle?

FIGURE 14.33 Pressure in the nozzle of this fire hose is less than at ground level for two reasons: The water has to go uphill to get to the
nozzle, and speed increases in the nozzle. In spite of its lowered pressure, the water can exert a large force on anything it strikes by virtue
of its kinetic energy. Pressure in the water stream becomes equal to atmospheric pressure once it emerges into the air.

Strategy
We must use Bernoulli's equation to solve for the pressure, since depth is not constant.

Solution
Bernoulli's equation is

where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the initial conditions at ground level and the final conditions inside the nozzle,

respectively. We must first find the speeds and . Since      , we get

Similarly, we find
This rather large speed is helpful in reaching the fire. Now, taking to be zero, we solve Bernoulli's equation for :
Substituting known values yields
686  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     Significance
     This value is a gauge pressure, since the initial pressure was given as a gauge pressure. Thus, the nozzle pressure
     equals atmospheric pressure because the water exits into the atmosphere without changes in its conditions.

     14.7 Viscosity and Turbulence

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain what viscosity is
         · Calculate flow and resistance with Poiseuille's law
         · Explain how pressure drops due to resistance

         · Use the Reynolds number for a system to determine whether it is laminar or turbulent
         · Describe the conditions under which an object has a terminal speed

     In Applications of Newton's Laws, which introduced the concept of friction, we saw that an object sliding across the
     floor with an initial velocity and no applied force comes to rest due to the force of friction. Friction depends on the
     types of materials in contact and is proportional to the normal force. We also discussed drag and air resistance in
     that same chapter. We explained that at low speeds, the drag is proportional to the velocity, whereas at high speeds,
     drag is proportional to the velocity squared. In this section, we introduce the forces of friction that act on fluids in
     motion. For example, a fluid flowing through a pipe is subject to resistance, a type of friction, between the fluid and
     the walls. Friction also occurs between the different layers of fluid. These resistive forces affect the way the fluid
     flows through the pipe.

     Viscosity and Laminar Flow

     When you pour yourself a glass of juice, the liquid flows freely and quickly. But if you pour maple syrup on your
     pancakes, that liquid flows slowly and sticks to the pitcher. The difference is fluid friction, both within the fluid itself
     and between the fluid and its surroundings. We call this property of fluids viscosity. Juice has low viscosity, whereas
     syrup has high viscosity.

     The precise definition of viscosity is based on laminar, or nonturbulent, flow. Figure 14.34 shows schematically how
     laminar and turbulent flow differ. When flow is laminar, layers flow without mixing. When flow is turbulent, the layers
     mix, and significant velocities occur in directions other than the overall direction of flow.

     FIGURE 14.34 (a) Laminar flow occurs in layers without mixing. Notice that viscosity causes drag between layers as well as with the fixed
     surface. The speed near the bottom of the flow ( ) is less than speed near the top ( ) because in this case, the surface of the containing
     vessel is at the bottom. (b) An obstruction in the vessel causes turbulent flow. Turbulent flow mixes the fluid. There is more interaction,
     greater heating, and more resistance than in laminar flow.

Turbulence is a fluid flow in which layers mix together via eddies and swirls. It has two main causes. First, any
obstruction or sharp corner, such as in a faucet, creates turbulence by imparting velocities perpendicular to the flow.
Second, high speeds cause turbulence. The drag between adjacent layers of fluid and between the fluid and its
surroundings can form swirls and eddies if the speed is great enough. In Figure 14.35, the speed of the accelerating
smoke reaches the point that it begins to swirl due to the drag between the smoke and the surrounding air.

FIGURE 14.35 Smoke rises smoothly for a while and then begins to form swirls and eddies. The smooth flow is called laminar flow,
whereas the swirls and eddies typify turbulent flow. Smoke rises more rapidly when flowing smoothly than after it becomes turbulent,
suggesting that turbulence poses more resistance to flow. (credit: "Creativity103"/Flickr)

Figure 14.36 shows how viscosity is measured for a fluid. The fluid to be measured is placed between two parallel
plates. The bottom plate is held fixed, while the top plate is moved to the right, dragging fluid with it. The layer (or
lamina) of fluid in contact with either plate does not move relative to the plate, so the top layer moves at speed v
while the bottom layer remains at rest. Each successive layer from the top down exerts a force on the one below it,
trying to drag it along, producing a continuous variation in speed from v to 0 as shown. Care is taken to ensure that
the flow is laminar, that is, the layers do not mix. The motion in the figure is like a continuous shearing motion. Fluids
have zero shear strength, but the rate at which they are sheared is related to the same geometrical factors A and L
as is shear deformation for solids. In the diagram, the fluid is initially at rest. The layer of fluid in contact with the
moving plate is accelerated and starts to move due to the internal friction between moving plate and the fluid. The
next layer is in contact with the moving layer; since there is internal friction between the two layers, it also
accelerates, and so on through the depth of the fluid. There is also internal friction between the stationary plate and
the lowest layer of fluid, next to the station plate. The force is required to keep the plate moving at a constant
velocity due to the internal friction.

FIGURE 14.36 Measurement of viscosity for laminar flow of fluid between two plates of area A. The bottom plate is fixed. When the top
plate is pushed to the right, it drags the fluid along with it.

A force F is required to keep the top plate in Figure 14.36 moving at a constant velocity v, and experiments have
shown that this force depends on four factors. First, F is directly proportional to v (until the speed is so high that
turbulence occurs--then a much larger force is needed, and it has a more complicated dependence on v). Second, F
is proportional to the area A of the plate. This relationship seems reasonable, since A is directly proportional to the
amount of fluid being moved. Third, F is inversely proportional to the distance between the plates L. This
688  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     relationship is also reasonable; L is like a lever arm, and the greater the lever arm, the less the force that is needed.
     Fourth, F is directly proportional to the coefficient of viscosity, . The greater the viscosity, the greater the force
     required. These dependencies are combined into the equation

     This equation gives us a working definition of fluid viscosity . Solving for gives

                                                                                                                   14.17

     which defines viscosity in terms of how it is measured.

     The SI unit of viscosity is                                   . Table 14.4 lists the coefficients of viscosity for

     various fluids. Viscosity varies from one fluid to another by several orders of magnitude. As you might expect, the

     viscosities of gases are much less than those of liquids, and these viscosities often depend on temperature.

Laminar Flow Confined to Tubes: Poiseuille's Law

What causes flow? The answer, not surprisingly, is a pressure difference. In fact, there is a very simple relationship
between horizontal flow and pressure. Flow rate Q is in the direction from high to low pressure. The greater the
pressure differential between two points, the greater the flow rate. This relationship can be stated as

where and are the pressures at two points, such as at either end of a tube, and R is the resistance to flow. The
resistance R includes everything, except pressure, that affects flow rate. For example, R is greater for a long tube
than for a short one. The greater the viscosity of a fluid, the greater the value of R. Turbulence greatly increases R,
whereas increasing the diameter of a tube decreases R.

If viscosity is zero, the fluid is frictionless and the resistance to flow is also zero. Comparing frictionless flow in a
tube to viscous flow, as in Figure 14.37, we see that for a viscous fluid, speed is greatest at midstream because of
drag at the boundaries. We can see the effect of viscosity in a Bunsen burner flame [part (c)], even though the
viscosity of natural gas is small.
690  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     FIGURE 14.37 (a) If fluid flow in a tube has negligible resistance, the speed is the same all across the tube. (b) When a viscous fluid flows
     through a tube, its speed at the walls is zero, increasing steadily to its maximum at the center of the tube. (c) The shape of a Bunsen burner
     flame is due to the velocity profile across the tube. (credit c: modification of work by "jasonwoodhead23"/Flickr)

     The resistance R to laminar flow of an incompressible fluid with viscosity through a horizontal tube of uniform
     radius r and length l, is given by

                                                                                                                                                        14.18

     This equation is called Poiseuille's law for resistance, named after the French scientist J. L. Poiseuille
     (1799-1869), who derived it in an attempt to understand the flow of blood through the body.

     Let us examine Poiseuille's expression for R to see if it makes good intuitive sense. We see that resistance is directly

     proportional to both fluid viscosity and the length l of a tube. After all, both of these directly affect the amount of

     friction encountered--the greater either is, the greater the resistance and the smaller the flow. The radius r of a tube

     affects the resistance, which again makes sense, because the greater the radius, the greater the flow (all other

     factors remaining the same). But it is surprising that r is raised to the fourth power in Poiseuille's law. This exponent

     means that any change in the radius of a tube has a very large effect on resistance. For example, doubling the radius

     of a tube decreases resistance by a factor of  .

     Taken together,                  and  give the following expression for flow rate:

                                                                                                                           14.19

     This equation describes laminar flow through a tube. It is sometimes called Poiseuille's law for laminar flow, or
     simply Poiseuille's law (Figure 14.38).

     FIGURE 14.38 Poiseuille's law applies to laminar flow of an incompressible fluid of viscosity through a tube of length l and radius r. The

     direction of flow is from greater to lower pressure. Flow rate Q is directly proportional to the pressure difference  , and inversely

        EXAMPLE 14.8

Using Flow Rate: Air Conditioning Systems

An air conditioning system is being designed to supply air at a gauge pressure of 0.054 Pa at a temperature of
The air is sent through an insulated, round conduit with a diameter of 18.00 cm. The conduit is 20-meters long and
is open to a room at atmospheric pressure 101.30 kPa. The room has a length of 12 meters, a width of 6 meters,
and a height of 3 meters. (a) What is the volume flow rate through the pipe, assuming laminar flow? (b) Estimate the
length of time to completely replace the air in the room. (c) The builders decide to save money by using a conduit
with a diameter of 9.00 cm. What is the new flow rate?

Strategy
Assuming laminar flow, Poiseuille's law states that

We need to compare the conduit radius before and after the flow rate reduction. Note that we are given the diameter
of the conduit, so we must divide by two to get the radius.

Solution

a. Assuming a constant pressure difference and using the viscosity  ,

b. Assuming constant flow

   c. Using laminar flow, Poiseuille's law yields

        Thus, the radius of the conduit decreases by half reduces the flow rate to 6.25% of the original value.
Significance
In general, assuming laminar flow, decreasing the radius has a more dramatic effect than changing the length. If the
length is increased and all other variables remain constant, the flow rate is decreased:

Doubling the length cuts the flow rate to one-half the original flow rate.

If the radius is decreased and all other variables remain constant, the volume flow rate decreases by a much larger
factor.
692  14 · Fluid Mechanics

     Cutting the radius in half decreases the flow rate to one-sixteenth the original flow rate.

     Flow and Resistance as Causes of Pressure Drops

     Water pressure in homes is sometimes lower than normal during times of heavy use, such as hot summer days. The
     drop in pressure occurs in the water main before it reaches individual homes. Let us consider flow through the water
     main as illustrated in Figure 14.39. We can understand why the pressure to the home drops during times of
     heavy use by rearranging the equation for flow rate:

     In this case, is the pressure at the water works and R is the resistance of the water main. During times of heavy

     use, the flow rate Q is large. This means that  must also be large. Thus must decrease. It is correct to

     think of flow and resistance as causing the pressure to drop from to . The equation                       is valid for

     both laminar and turbulent flows.

     FIGURE 14.39 During times of heavy use, there is a significant pressure drop in a water main, and supplied to users is significantly less

     than created at the water works. If the flow is very small, then the pressure drop is negligible, and  .

     We can also use                  to analyze pressure drops occurring in more complex systems in which the tube

     radius is not the same everywhere. Resistance is much greater in narrow places, such as in an obstructed coronary

     artery. For a given flow rate Q, the pressure drop is greatest where the tube is most narrow. This is how water

     faucets control flow. Additionally, R is greatly increased by turbulence, and a constriction that creates turbulence

     greatly reduces the pressure downstream. Plaque in an artery reduces pressure and hence flow, both by its

     resistance and by the turbulence it creates.

     Measuring Turbulence

     An indicator called the Reynolds number can reveal whether flow is laminar or turbulent. For flow in a tube of
     uniform diameter, the Reynolds number is defined as

                                                                                                                      14.20

     where is the fluid density, v its speed, its viscosity, and r the tube radius. The Reynolds number is a   below
     dimensionless quantity. Experiments have revealed that is related to the onset of turbulence. For
     about 2000, flow is laminar. For above about 3000, flow is turbulent.

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                    14.7 · Viscosity and Turbulence        693

For values of between about 2000 and 3000, flow is unstable--that is, it can be laminar, but small obstructions
and surface roughness can make it turbulent, and it may oscillate randomly between being laminar and turbulent. In
fact, the flow of a fluid with a Reynolds number between 2000 and 3000 is a good example of chaotic behavior. A
system is defined to be chaotic when its behavior is so sensitive to some factor that it is extremely difficult to
predict. It is difficult, but not impossible, to predict whether flow is turbulent or not when a fluid's Reynold's number
falls in this range due to extremely sensitive dependence on factors like roughness and obstructions on the nature of
the flow. A tiny variation in one factor has an exaggerated (or nonlinear) effect on the flow.

EXAMPLE 14.9

Using Flow Rate: Turbulent Flow or Laminar Flow

In Example 14.8, we found the volume flow rate of an air conditioning system to be  This

calculation assumed laminar flow. (a) Was this a good assumption? (b) At what velocity would the flow become

turbulent?

Strategy
To determine if the flow of air through the air conditioning system is laminar, we first need to find the velocity, which
can be found by

Then we can calculate the Reynold's number, using the equation below, and determine if it falls in the range for
laminar flow

Solution
  a. Using the values given:

        Since the Reynolds number is 1835 < 2000, the flow is laminar and not turbulent. The assumption that the
        flow was laminar is valid.
  b. To find the maximum speed of the air to keep the flow laminar, consider the Reynold's number.

Significance
When transferring a fluid from one point to another, it desirable to limit turbulence. Turbulence results in wasted
energy, as some of the energy intended to move the fluid is dissipated when eddies are formed. In this case, the air
conditioning system will become less efficient once the velocity exceeds 0.16 m/s, since this is the point at which
turbulence will begin to occur.

INTRODUCTION We begin the study of oscillations with simple systems of pendulums and springs. Although these
systems may seem quite basic, the concepts involved have many real-life applications. For example, the Comcast
Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, stands approximately 305 meters (1000 feet) tall. As buildings are built
taller, they can act as inverted, physical pendulums, with the top floors oscillating due to seismic activity and
fluctuating winds. In the Comcast Building, a tuned-mass damper is used to reduce the oscillations. Installed at the
top of the building is a tuned, liquid-column mass damper, consisting of a 300,000-gallon reservoir of water. This U-
shaped tank allows the water to oscillate freely at a frequency that matches the natural frequency of the building.
Damping is provided by tuning the turbulence levels in the moving water using baffles.

     15.1 Simple Harmonic Motion

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define the terms period and frequency
         · List the characteristics of simple harmonic motion
         · Explain the concept of phase shift
         · Write the equations of motion for the system of a mass and spring undergoing simple harmonic motion
         · Describe the motion of a mass oscillating on a vertical spring

     When you pluck a guitar string, the resulting sound has a steady tone and lasts a long time (Figure 15.2). The string
     vibrates around an equilibrium position, and one oscillation is completed when the string starts from the initial
     position, travels to one of the extreme positions, then to the other extreme position, and returns to its initial
     position. We define periodic motion to be any motion that repeats itself at regular time intervals, such as exhibited
     by the guitar string or by a child swinging on a swing. In this section, we study the basic characteristics of
     oscillations and their mathematical description.

     surrounding air molecules to oscillate, producing sound waves. (credit: Yutaka Tsutano)

     Period and Frequency in Oscillations

     In the absence of friction, the time to complete one oscillation remains constant and is called the period (T). Its
     units are usually seconds, but may be any convenient unit of time. The word `period' refers to the time for some
     event whether repetitive or not, but in this chapter, we shall deal primarily in periodic motion, which is by definition
     repetitive.
     A concept closely related to period is the frequency of an event. Frequency (f) is defined to be the number of events
     per unit time. For periodic motion, frequency is the number of oscillations per unit time. The relationship between
     frequency and period is

                                                                                                                                                          15.1

     The SI unit for frequency is the hertz (Hz) and is defined as one cycle per second:

     A cycle is one complete oscillation.

EXAMPLE 15.1

Determining the Frequency of Medical Ultrasound

Ultrasound machines are used by medical professionals to make images for examining internal organs of the body.

An ultrasound machine emits high-frequency sound waves, which reflect off the organs, and a computer receives

the waves, using them to create a picture. We can use the formulas presented in this module to determine the

frequency, based on what we know about oscillations. Consider a medical imaging device that produces ultrasound

by oscillating with a period of     . What is the frequency of this oscillation?

Strategy
The period (T) is given and we are asked to find frequency (f).

Significance

This frequency of sound is much higher than the highest frequency that humans can hear (the range of human
hearing is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz); therefore, it is called ultrasound. Appropriate oscillations at this frequency generate
ultrasound used for noninvasive medical diagnoses, such as observations of a fetus in the womb.

Characteristics of Simple Harmonic Motion

A very common type of periodic motion is called simple harmonic motion (SHM). A system that oscillates with SHM
is called a simple harmonic oscillator.

  SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

  In simple harmonic motion, the acceleration of the system, and therefore the net force, is proportional to the
  displacement and acts in the opposite direction of the displacement.

A good example of SHM is an object with mass m attached to a spring on a frictionless surface, as shown in Figure

15.3. The object oscillates around the equilibrium position, and the net force on the object is equal to the force

provided by the spring. This force obeys Hooke's law             as discussed in a previous chapter.

If the net force can be described by Hooke's law and there is no damping (slowing down due to friction or other
nonconservative forces), then a simple harmonic oscillator oscillates with equal displacement on either side of the
equilibrium position, as shown for an object on a spring in Figure 15.3. The maximum displacement from
equilibrium is called the amplitude (A). The units for amplitude and displacement are the same but depend on the
type of oscillation. For the object on the spring, the units of amplitude and displacement are meters.

     FIGURE 15.3 An object attached to a spring sliding on a frictionless surface is an uncomplicated simple harmonic oscillator. In the above

     set of figures, a mass is attached to a spring and placed on a frictionless table. The other end of the spring is attached to the wall. The

     position of the mass, when the spring is neither stretched nor compressed, is marked as  and is the equilibrium position. (a) The mass

     is displaced to a position    and released from rest. (b) The mass accelerates as it moves in the negative x-direction, reaching a

     maximum negative velocity at     . (c) The mass continues to move in the negative x-direction, slowing until it comes to a stop at

     . (d) The mass now begins to accelerate in the positive x-direction, reaching a positive maximum velocity at  . (e) The mass then

     continues to move in the positive direction until it stops at  . The mass continues in SHM that has an amplitude A and a period T. The

     object's maximum speed occurs as it passes through equilibrium. The stiffer the spring is, the smaller the period T. The greater the mass of

     the object is, the greater the period T.

     What is so significant about SHM? For one thing, the period T and frequency f of a simple harmonic oscillator are
     independent of amplitude. The string of a guitar, for example, oscillates with the same frequency whether plucked
     gently or hard.

     Two important factors do affect the period of a simple harmonic oscillator. The period is related to how stiff the
     system is. A very stiff object has a large force constant (k), which causes the system to have a smaller period. For
     example, you can adjust a diving board's stiffness--the stiffer it is, the faster it vibrates, and the shorter its period.
     Period also depends on the mass of the oscillating system. The more massive the system is, the longer the period.
     For example, a heavy person on a diving board bounces up and down more slowly than a light one. In fact, the mass
     m and the force constant k are the only factors that affect the period and frequency of SHM. To derive an equation
     for the period and the frequency, we must first define and analyze the equations of motion. Note that the force
     constant is sometimes referred to as the spring constant.

     Equations of SHM

     Consider a block attached to a spring on a frictionless table (Figure 15.4). The equilibrium position (the position

     where the spring is neither stretched nor compressed) is marked as                       . At the equilibrium position, the net force

     is zero.

     FIGURE 15.4 A block is attached to a spring and placed on a frictionless table. The equilibrium position, where the spring is neither
     extended nor compressed, is marked as

     Work is done on the block to pull it out to a position of      and it is then released from rest. The maximum

     x-position (A) is called the amplitude of the motion. The block begins to oscillate in SHM between            and

            where A is the amplitude of the motion and T is the period of the oscillation. The period is the time for one
oscillation. Figure 15.5 shows the motion of the block as it completes one and a half oscillations after release.
Figure 15.6 shows a plot of the position of the block versus time. When the position is plotted versus time, it is clear
that the data can be modeled by a cosine function with an amplitude A and a period T. The cosine function
repeats every multiple of whereas the motion of the block repeats every period T. However, the function

              repeats every integer multiple of the period. The maximum of the cosine function is one, so it is
necessary to multiply the cosine function by the amplitude A.

                                                                                                                                                     15.2

Recall from the chapter on rotation that the angular frequency equals             . In this case, the period is constant,

so the angular frequency is defined as divided by the period,                  .

     FIGURE 15.6 A graph of the position of the block shown in Figure 15.5 as a function of time. The position can be modeled as a periodic
     function, such as a cosine or sine function.

     The equation for the position as a function of time              is good for modeling data, where the position

     of the block at the initial time           is at the amplitude A and the initial velocity is zero. Often when taking

     experimental data, the position of the mass at the initial time  is not equal to the amplitude and the initial

     velocity is not zero. Consider 10 seconds of data collected by a student in lab, shown in Figure 15.7.

     FIGURE 15.7 Data collected by a student in lab indicate the position of a block attached to a spring, measured with a sonic range finder.

     The data are collected starting at time    but the initial position is near position  , so the initial position

     does not equal the amplitude               . The velocity is the time derivative of the position, which is the slope at a point on the graph of

     position versus time. The velocity is not  at time   , as evident by the slope of the graph of position versus time, which

     is not zero at the initial time.

     The data in Figure 15.7 can still be modeled with a periodic function, like a cosine function, but the function is
     shifted to the right. This shift is known as a phase shift and is usually represented by the Greek letter phi . The
     equation of the position as a function of time for a block on a spring becomes

     This is the generalized equation for SHM where t is the time measured in seconds, is the angular frequency with
     units of inverse seconds, A is the amplitude measured in meters or centimeters, and is the phase shift measured
     in radians (Figure 15.8). It should be noted that because sine and cosine functions differ only by a phase shift, this
     motion could be modeled using either the cosine or sine function.

equation:

Because the sine function oscillates between -1 and +1, the maximum velocity is the amplitude times the angular

frequency,          . The maximum velocity occurs at the equilibrium position           when the mass is moving

toward         . The maximum velocity in the negative direction is attained at the equilibrium position          when

the mass is moving toward     and is equal to             .

The acceleration of the mass on the spring can be found by taking the time derivative of the velocity:

The maximum acceleration is                   . The maximum acceleration occurs at the position          , and the
acceleration at the position
                                       and is equal to         .

A 2.00-kg block is placed on a frictionless surface. A spring with a force constant of           is attached to

the block, and the opposite end of the spring is attached to the wall. The spring can be compressed or extended.

Strategy

We first find the angular frequency. The phase shift is zero,     because the block is released from rest at

                    Once the angular frequency is found, we can determine the maximum velocity and maximum

     The Period and Frequency of a Mass on a Spring

     One interesting characteristic of the SHM of an object attached to a spring is that the angular frequency, and
     therefore the period and frequency of the motion, depend on only the mass and the force constant, and not on other
     factors such as the amplitude of the motion. We can use the equations of motion and Newton's second law

                      to find equations for the angular frequency, frequency, and period.

     Consider the block on a spring on a frictionless surface. There are three forces on the mass: the weight, the normal
     force, and the force due to the spring. The only two forces that act perpendicular to the surface are the weight and
     the normal force, which have equal magnitudes and opposite directions, and thus sum to zero. The only force that
     acts parallel to the surface is the force due to the spring, so the net force must be equal to the force of the spring:

     Substituting the equations of motion for x and a gives us

     Cancelling out like terms and solving for the angular frequency yields

                                                                                                                15.9

     The angular frequency depends only on the force constant and the mass, and not the amplitude. The angular

     frequency is defined as          which yields an equation for the period of the motion:

                                                                                                                15.10

     The period also depends only on the mass and the force constant. The greater the mass, the longer the period. The
     stiffer the spring, the shorter the period. The frequency is

                                                                                                                                                        15.11

Vertical Motion and a Horizontal Spring

When a spring is hung vertically and a block is attached and set in motion, the block oscillates in SHM. In this case,
there is no normal force, and the net effect of the force of gravity is to change the equilibrium position. Consider
Figure 15.9. Two forces act on the block: the weight and the force of the spring. The weight is constant and the force
of the spring changes as the length of the spring changes.

FIGURE 15.9 A spring is hung from the ceiling. When a block is attached, the block is at the equilibrium position where the weight of the

block is equal to the force of the spring. (a) The spring is hung from the ceiling and the equilibrium position is marked as . (b) A mass is

attached to the spring and a new equilibrium position is reached (  ) when the force provided by the spring equals the weight

of the mass. (c) The free-body diagram of the mass shows the two forces acting on the mass: the weight and the force of the spring.

When the block reaches the equilibrium position, as seen in Figure 15.9, the force of the spring equals the weight of

the block,                 , where

From the figure, the change in the position is                      and since  , we have

If the block is displaced and released, it will oscillate around the new equilibrium position. As shown in Figure
15.10, if the position of the block is recorded as a function of time, the recording is a periodic function.

If the block is displaced to a position y, the net force becomes                           . But we found that at

the equilibrium position,                       . Substituting for the weight in the equation yields

Recall that  is just the equilibrium position and any position can be set to be the point             So let's set
to            The net force then becomes

This is just what we found previously for a horizontally sliding mass on a spring. The constant force of gravity only

served to shift the equilibrium location of the mass. Therefore, the solution should be the same form as for a block

on a horizontal spring,                         The equations for the velocity and the acceleration also have the

same form as for the horizontal case. Note that the inclusion of the phase shift means that the motion can actually

be modeled using either a cosine or a sine function, since these two functions only differ by a phase shift.

into thermal, sound, or kinetic energy, then all the work is initially stored in the deformed object as some form of
potential energy.

Consider the example of a block attached to a spring on a frictionless table, oscillating in SHM. The force of the
spring is a conservative force (which you studied in the chapter on potential energy and conservation of energy), and
we can define a potential energy for it. This potential energy is the energy stored in the spring when the spring is
extended or compressed. In this case, the block oscillates in one dimension with the force of the spring acting
parallel to the motion:

When considering the energy stored in a spring, the equilibrium position, marked as        is the position at

which the energy stored in the spring is equal to zero. When the spring is stretched or compressed a distance x, the

potential energy stored in the spring is

Energy and the Simple Harmonic Oscillator

To study the energy of a simple harmonic oscillator, we need to consider all the forms of energy. Consider the
example of a block attached to a spring, placed on a frictionless surface, oscillating in SHM. The potential energy
stored in the deformation of the spring is

In a simple harmonic oscillator, the energy oscillates between kinetic energy of the mass  and potential

energy  stored in the spring. In the SHM of the mass and spring system, there are no dissipative forces,

so the total energy is the sum of the potential energy and kinetic energy. In this section, we consider the
conservation of energy of the system. The concepts examined are valid for all simple harmonic oscillators, including
those where the gravitational force plays a role.

Consider Figure 15.11, which shows an oscillating block attached to a spring. In the case of undamped SHM, the
energy oscillates back and forth between kinetic and potential, going completely from one form of energy to the
other as the system oscillates. So for the simple example of an object on a frictionless surface attached to a spring,
the motion starts with all of the energy stored in the spring as elastic potential energy. As the object starts to move,
the elastic potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, becoming entirely kinetic energy at the equilibrium
position. The energy is then converted back into elastic potential energy by the spring as it is stretched or
compressed. The velocity becomes zero when the kinetic energy is completely converted, and this cycle then
repeats. Understanding the conservation of energy in these cycles will provide extra insight here and in later
applications of SHM, such as alternating circuits.

     FIGURE 15.11 The transformation of energy in SHM for an object attached to a spring on a frictionless surface. (a) When the mass is at the

     position      , all the energy is stored as potential energy in the spring             . The kinetic energy is equal to zero because the

     velocity of the mass is zero. (b) As the mass moves toward     , the mass crosses the position  . At this point, the spring is neither

     extended nor compressed, so the potential energy stored in the spring is zero. At      , the total energy is all kinetic energy where

                        . (c) The mass continues to move until it reaches        where the mass stops and starts moving toward              . At

     The mass returns to the position      , where  and                    .

     Consider Figure 15.11, which shows the energy at specific points on the periodic motion. While staying constant, the
     energy oscillates between the kinetic energy of the block and the potential energy stored in the spring:

     The motion of the block on a spring in SHM is defined by the position                           with a velocity of
                                       . Using these equations, the trigonometric identity
                                                                                                     and                                    , we
     can find the total energy of the system:

     The total energy of the system of a block and a spring is equal to the sum of the potential energy stored in the spring

     plus the kinetic energy of the block and is proportional to the square of the amplitude                                    The total

     energy of the system is constant.

     A closer look at the energy of the system shows that the kinetic energy oscillates like a sine-squared function, while

     the potential energy oscillates like a cosine-squared function. However, the total energy for the system is constant

     and is proportional to the amplitude squared. Figure 15.12 shows a plot of the potential, kinetic, and total energies

the block is released from rest.

FIGURE 15.12 Graph of the kinetic energy, potential energy, and total energy of a block oscillating on a spring in SHM. Also shown are the
graphs of position versus time and velocity versus time. The total energy remains constant, but the energy oscillates between kinetic
energy and potential energy. When the kinetic energy is maximum, the potential energy is zero. This occurs when the velocity is maximum
and the mass is at the equilibrium position. The potential energy is maximum when the speed is zero. The total energy is the sum of the
kinetic energy plus the potential energy and it is constant.

Oscillations About an Equilibrium Position

We have just considered the energy of SHM as a function of time. Another interesting view of the simple harmonic
oscillator is to consider the energy as a function of position. Figure 15.13 shows a graph of the energy versus
position of a system undergoing SHM.

FIGURE 15.13 A graph of the kinetic energy (red), potential energy (blue), and total energy (green) of a simple harmonic oscillator. The

force is equal to  . The equilibrium position is shown as a black dot and is the point where the force is equal to zero. The force is

positive when      , negative when  , and equal to zero when  .

The potential energy curve in Figure 15.13 resembles a bowl. When a marble is placed in a bowl, it settles to the

equilibrium position at the lowest point of the bowl          . This happens because a restoring force points toward
720  15 · Oscillations

     the equilibrium point. This equilibrium point is sometimes referred to as a fixed point. When the marble is disturbed

     to a different position          , the marble oscillates around the equilibrium position. Looking back at the graph of

     potential energy, the force can be found by looking at the slope of the potential energy graph         . Since the

     force on either side of the fixed point points back toward the equilibrium point, the equilibrium point is called a

     stable equilibrium point. The points  and  are called the turning points. (See Potential Energy and

     Conservation of Energy.)

     Stability is an important concept. If an equilibrium point is stable, a slight disturbance of an object that is initially at
     the stable equilibrium point will cause the object to oscillate around that point. The stable equilibrium point occurs
     because the force on either side is directed toward it. For an unstable equilibrium point, if the object is disturbed
     slightly, it does not return to the equilibrium point.

     Consider the marble in the bowl example. If the bowl is right-side up, the marble, if disturbed slightly, will oscillate
     around the stable equilibrium point. If the bowl is turned upside down, the marble can be balanced on the top, at
     the equilibrium point where the net force is zero. However, if the marble is disturbed slightly, it will not return to the
     equilibrium point, but will instead roll off the bowl. The reason is that the force on either side of the equilibrium
     point is directed away from that point. This point is an unstable equilibrium point.

     Figure 15.14 shows three conditions. The first is a stable equilibrium point (a), the second is an unstable equilibrium
     point (b), and the last is also an unstable equilibrium point (c), because the force on only one side points toward the
     equilibrium point.

     FIGURE 15.14 Examples of equilibrium points. (a) Stable equilibrium point; (b) unstable equilibrium point; (c) unstable equilibrium point
     (sometimes referred to as a half-stable equilibrium point).

     The process of determining whether an equilibrium point is stable or unstable can be formalized. Consider the
     potential energy curves shown in Figure 15.15. The force can be found by analyzing the slope of the graph. The force

     is  In (a), the fixed point is at          When                           the force is positive. When                the

     force is negative. This is a stable point. In (b), the fixed point is at  When                  the force is

This point is sometimes called half-stable because the force on one side points toward the fixed point.

A practical application of the concept of stable equilibrium points is the force between two neutral atoms in a
molecule. If two molecules are in close proximity, separated by a few atomic diameters, they can experience an
attractive force. If the molecules move close enough so that the electron shells of the other electrons overlap, the
force between the molecules becomes repulsive. The attractive force between the two atoms may cause the atoms
to form a molecule. The force between the two molecules is not a linear force and cannot be modeled simply as two
masses separated by a spring, but the atoms of the molecule can oscillate around an equilibrium point when
displaced a small amount from the equilibrium position. The atoms oscillate due the attractive force and repulsive
force between the two atoms.

Consider one example of the interaction between two atoms known as the van Der Waals interaction. It is beyond
the scope of this chapter to discuss in depth the interactions of the two atoms, but the oscillations of the atoms can
be examined by considering one example of a model of the potential energy of the system. One suggestion to model
the potential energy of this molecule is with the Lennard-Jones 6-12 potential:

A graph of this function is shown in Figure 15.16. The two parameters and are found experimentally.

     FIGURE 15.16 The Lennard-Jones potential energy function for a system of two neutral atoms. If the energy is below some maximum
     energy, the system oscillates near the equilibrium position between the two turning points.

     From the graph, you can see that there is a potential energy well, which has some similarities to the potential energy

     well of the potential energy function of the simple harmonic oscillator discussed in Figure 15.13. The Lennard-Jones

     potential has a stable equilibrium point where the potential energy is minimum and the force on either side of the

     equilibrium point points toward equilibrium point. Note that unlike the simple harmonic oscillator, the potential well

     of the Lennard-Jones potential is not symmetric. This is due to the fact that the force between the atoms is not a

     Hooke's law force and is not linear. The atoms can still oscillate around the equilibrium position    because when

     , the force is positive; when                 , the force is negative. Notice that as x approaches zero, the slope is

     quite steep and negative, which means that the force is large and positive. This suggests that it takes a large force to

     try to push the atoms close together. As x becomes increasingly large, the slope becomes less steep and the force is

     smaller and negative. This suggests that if given a large enough energy, the atoms can be separated.

     If you are interested in this interaction, find the force between the molecules by taking the derivative of the potential

     energy function. You will see immediately that the force does not resemble a Hooke's law force                , but if

     you are familiar with the binomial theorem:

     the force can be approximated by a Hooke's law force.

     Velocity and Energy Conservation

     Getting back to the system of a block and a spring in Figure 15.11, once the block is released from rest, it begins to

     move in the negative direction toward the equilibrium position. The potential energy decreases and the magnitude

     of the velocity and the kinetic energy increase. At time  , the block reaches the equilibrium position

                    where the force on the block and the potential energy are zero. At the equilibrium position, the block

     reaches a negative velocity with a magnitude equal to the maximum velocity     . The kinetic energy is

     maximum and equal to                                      At this point, the force on the block is zero, but

     momentum carries the block, and it continues in the negative direction toward  . As the block continues to

     move, the force on it acts in the positive direction and the magnitude of the velocity and kinetic energy decrease.

     The potential energy increases as the spring compresses. At time          , the block reaches         . Here the

     velocity and kinetic energy are equal to zero. The force on the block is       and the potential energy stored in

     the spring is         . During the oscillations, the total energy is constant and equal to the sum of the potential

     energy and the kinetic energy of the system,

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe how the sine and cosine functions relate to the concepts of circular motion
    · Describe the connection between simple harmonic motion and circular motion

An easy way to model SHM is by considering uniform circular motion. Figure 15.17 shows one way of using this

method. A peg (a cylinder of wood) is attached to a vertical disk, rotating with a constant angular frequency. Figure

15.18 shows a side view of the disk and peg. If a lamp is placed above the disk and peg, the peg produces a shadow.

Let the disk have a radius of  and define the position of the shadow that coincides with the center line of the

disk to be  . As the disk rotates at a constant rate, the shadow oscillates between         and                     .

FIGURE 15.18 Light shines down on the disk so that the peg makes a shadow. If the disk rotates at just the right angular frequency, the

shadow follows the motion of the block on a spring. If there is no energy dissipated due to nonconservative forces, the block and the

shadow will oscillate back and forth in unison. In this figure, four snapshots are taken at four different times. (a) The wheel starts at

shadow of the peg is between     and  . (c) The disk continues to rotate until    , at which the shadow follows the mass to

. (d) The disk continues to rotate, the shadow follows the position of the mass.

If the disk turns at the proper angular frequency, the shadow follows along with the block. The position of the
shadow can be modeled with the equation

                                                                                                                  15.14

Recall that the block attached to the spring does not move at a constant velocity. How often does the wheel have to

turn to have the peg's shadow always on the block? The disk must turn at a constant angular frequency equal to

times the frequency of oscillation    .

Figure 15.19 shows the basic relationship between uniform circular motion and SHM. The peg lies at the tip of the
radius, a distance A from the center of the disk. The x-axis is defined by a line drawn parallel to the ground, cutting

     the disk in half. The y-axis (not shown) is defined by a line perpendicular to the ground, cutting the disk into a left

     half and a right half. The center of the disk is the point                          The projection of the position of the peg onto

     the fixed x-axis gives the position of the shadow, which undergoes SHM analogous to the system of the block and

     spring. At the time shown in the figure, the projection has position x and moves to the left with velocity v. The

     tangential velocity of the peg around the circle equals           of the block on the spring. The x-component of the

measure the acceleration due to gravity. For small displacements, a pendulum is a simple harmonic oscillator.

The Simple Pendulum

A simple pendulum is defined to have a point mass, also known as the pendulum bob, which is suspended from a
string of length L with negligible mass (Figure 15.20). Here, the only forces acting on the bob are the force of gravity
(i.e., the weight of the bob) and tension from the string. The mass of the string is assumed to be negligible as
compared to the mass of the bob.

FIGURE 15.20 A simple pendulum has a small-diameter bob and a string that has a very small mass but is strong enough not to stretch

appreciably. The linear displacement from equilibrium is s, the length of the arc. Also shown are the forces on the bob, which result in a net

force of  toward the equilibrium position--that is, a restoring force.

Consider the torque on the pendulum. The force providing the restoring torque is the component of the weight of the
pendulum bob that acts along the arc length. The torque is the length of the string L times the component of the net
force that is perpendicular to the radius of the arc. The minus sign indicates the torque acts in the opposite direction
of the angular displacement:

The solution to this differential equation involves advanced calculus, and is beyond the scope of this text. But note

that for small angles (less than 15 degrees or about 0.26 radians),     and differ by less than 1%, if  is

measured in radians. We can then use the small angle approximation      The angle describes the position

of the pendulum. Using the small angle approximation gives an approximate solution for small angles,

                                                                                                            15.17

Because this equation has the same form as the equation for SHM, the solution is easy to find. The angular
frequency is

     The period of a simple pendulum depends on its length and the acceleration due to gravity. The period is completely
     independent of other factors, such as mass and the maximum displacement. As with simple harmonic oscillators,
     the period T for a pendulum is nearly independent of amplitude, especially if is less than about Even simple
     pendulum clocks can be finely adjusted and remain accurate.

     Note the dependence of T on g. If the length of a pendulum is precisely known, it can actually be used to measure
     the acceleration due to gravity, as in the following example.

     EXAMPLE 15.3

     Measuring Acceleration due to Gravity by the Period of a Pendulum

     What is the acceleration due to gravity in a region where a simple pendulum having a length 75.000 cm has a period
     of 1.7357 s?

     Strategy

     We are asked to find g given the period T and the length L of a pendulum. We can solve  for g, assuming

     This method for determining g can be very accurate, which is why length and period are given to five digits in this

     example. For the precision of the approximation    to be better than the precision of the pendulum length

     and period, the maximum displacement angle should be kept below about .

     An engineer builds two simple pendulums. Both are suspended from small wires secured to the ceiling of a room.

     Physical Pendulum

     Any object can oscillate like a pendulum. Consider a coffee mug hanging on a hook in the pantry. If the mug gets
     knocked, it oscillates back and forth like a pendulum until the oscillations die out. We have described a simple
     pendulum as a point mass and a string. A physical pendulum is any object whose oscillations are similar to those of
     the simple pendulum, but cannot be modeled as a point mass on a string, and the mass distribution must be
     included into the equation of motion.

As for the simple pendulum, the restoring force of the physical pendulum is the force of gravity. With the simple
pendulum, the force of gravity acts on the center of the pendulum bob. In the case of the physical pendulum, the
force of gravity acts on the center of mass (CM) of an object. The object oscillates about a point O. Consider an
object of a generic shape as shown in Figure 15.21.

FIGURE 15.21 A physical pendulum is any object that oscillates as a pendulum, but cannot be modeled as a point mass on a string. The
force of gravity acts on the center of mass (CM) and provides the restoring force that causes the object to oscillate. The minus sign on the
component of the weight that provides the restoring force is present because the force acts in the opposite direction of the increasing angle

 .

When a physical pendulum is hanging from a point but is free to rotate, it rotates because of the torque applied at
the CM, produced by the component of the object's weight that acts tangent to the motion of the CM. Taking the
counterclockwise direction to be positive, the component of the gravitational force that acts tangent to the motion is

             . The minus sign is the result of the restoring force acting in the opposite direction of the increasing angle.

Recall that the torque is equal to        . The magnitude of the torque is equal to the length of the radius arm

times the tangential component of the force applied,  . Here, the length L of the radius arm is the

distance between the point of rotation and the CM. To analyze the motion, start with the net torque. Like the simple

pendulum, consider only small angles so that          . Recall from Fixed-Axis Rotation on rotation that the net

torque is equal to the moment of inertia              times the angular acceleration where  :

Using the small angle approximation and rearranging:

Once again, the equation says that the second time derivative of the position (in this case, the angle) equals minus a

constant  times the position. The solution is

where is the maximum angular displacement. The angular frequency is

                                                                                               15.20

The period is therefore

     Reducing the Swaying of a Skyscraper

     In extreme conditions, skyscrapers can sway up to two meters with a frequency of up to 20.00 Hz due to high winds
     or seismic activity. Several companies have developed physical pendulums that are placed on the top of the
     skyscrapers. As the skyscraper sways to the right, the pendulum swings to the left, reducing the sway. Assuming the
     oscillations have a frequency of 0.50 Hz, design a pendulum that consists of a long beam, of constant density, with a
     mass of 100 metric tons and a pivot point at one end of the beam. What should be the length of the beam?

     Strategy
     We are asked to find the length of the physical pendulum with a known mass. We first need to find the moment of
     inertia of the beam. We can then use the equation for the period of a physical pendulum to find the length.

Significance
There are many ways to reduce the oscillations, including modifying the shape of the skyscrapers, using multiple
physical pendulums, and using tuned-mass dampers.

Torsional Pendulum

A torsional pendulum consists of a rigid body suspended by a light wire or spring (Figure 15.22). When the body is

twisted some small maximum angle and released from rest, the body oscillates between      and

        . The restoring torque is supplied by the shearing of the string or wire.

FIGURE 15.22 A torsional pendulum consists of a rigid body suspended by a string or wire. The rigid body oscillates between  and

     .

The restoring torque can be modeled as being proportional to the angle:

The variable kappa is known as the torsion constant of the wire or string. The minus sign shows that the
restoring torque acts in the opposite direction to increasing angular displacement. The net torque is equal to the
moment of inertia times the angular acceleration:

This equation says that the second time derivative of the position (in this case, the angle) equals a negative constant

times the position. This looks very similar to the equation of motion for the SHM         , where the period was

found to be         . Therefore, the period of the torsional pendulum can be found using

                                                                                                                             15.22

The units for the torsion constant are                                   and the units for the moment of inertial

are          which show that the unit for the period is the second.

Figure 15.25 shows a mass m attached to a spring with a force constant The mass is raised to a position , the
initial amplitude, and then released. The mass oscillates around the equilibrium position in a fluid with viscosity but
the amplitude decreases for each oscillation. For a system that has a small amount of damping, the period and
frequency are constant and are nearly the same as for SHM, but the amplitude gradually decreases as shown. This
occurs because the non-conservative damping force removes energy from the system, usually in the form of thermal
energy.

FIGURE 15.25 For a mass on a spring oscillating in a viscous fluid, the period remains constant, but the amplitudes of the oscillations
decrease due to the damping caused by the fluid.

Consider the forces acting on the mass. Note that the only contribution of the weight is to change the equilibrium

position, as discussed earlier in the chapter. Therefore, the net force is equal to the force of the spring and the

damping force     . If the magnitude of the velocity is small, meaning the mass oscillates slowly, the damping

force is proportional to the velocity and acts against the direction of motion         . The net force on the mass

is therefore

Writing this as a differential equation in x, we obtain

                                                                                              15.23

     It is left as an exercise to prove that this is, in fact, the solution. To prove that it is the right solution, take the first

     function inside an exponential envelope.

     Recall that when we began this description of damped harmonic motion, we stated that the damping must be small.
     Two questions come to mind. Why must the damping be small? And how small is small? If you gradually increase
     the amount of damping in a system, the period and frequency begin to be affected, because damping opposes and
     hence slows the back and forth motion. (The net force is smaller in both directions.) If there is very large damping,
     the system does not even oscillate--it slowly moves toward equilibrium. The angular frequency is equal to

system is said to be underdamped, as in curve (a). Many systems are underdamped, and oscillate while the

amplitude decreases exponentially, such as the mass oscillating on a spring. The damping may be quite small, but

eventually the mass comes to rest. If the damping constant is    , the system is said to be critically

damped, as in curve (b). An example of a critically damped system is the shock absorbers in a car. It is

advantageous to have the oscillations decay as fast as possible. Here, the system does not oscillate, but

asymptotically approaches the equilibrium condition as quickly as possible. Curve (c) in Figure 15.27 represents an

overdamped system where                          An overdamped system will approach equilibrium over a longer period of

time.

FIGURE 15.27 The position versus time for three systems consisting of a mass and a spring in a viscous fluid. (a) If the damping is small
                   , the mass oscillates, slowly losing amplitude as the energy is dissipated by the non-conservative force(s). The limiting case

is (b) where the damping is  . (c) If the damping is very large  , the mass does not oscillate when displaced, but

attempts to return to the equilibrium position.

Critical damping is often desired, because such a system returns to equilibrium rapidly and remains at equilibrium
as well. In addition, a constant force applied to a critically damped system moves the system to a new equilibrium
position in the shortest time possible without overshooting or oscillating about the new position.

Sit in front of a piano sometime and sing a loud brief note at it with the dampers off its strings (Figure 15.28). It will
sing the same note back at you--the strings, having the same frequencies as your voice, are resonating in response
to the forces from the sound waves that you sent to them. This is a good example of the fact that objects--in this
case, piano strings--can be forced to oscillate, and oscillate most easily at their natural frequency. In this section,
we briefly explore applying a periodic driving force acting on a simple harmonic oscillator. The driving force puts
energy into the system at a certain frequency, not necessarily the same as the natural frequency of the system.
Recall that the natural frequency is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if there were no driving and no
damping force.

     Most of us have played with toys involving an object supported on an elastic band, something like the paddle ball
     suspended from a finger in Figure 15.29. Imagine the finger in the figure is your finger. At first, you hold your finger
     steady, and the ball bounces up and down with a small amount of damping. If you move your finger up and down
     slowly, the ball follows along without bouncing much on its own. As you increase the frequency at which you move
     your finger up and down, the ball responds by oscillating with increasing amplitude. When you drive the ball at its
     natural frequency, the ball's oscillations increase in amplitude with each oscillation for as long as you drive it. The
     phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called resonance. A system being
     driven at its natural frequency is said to resonate. As the driving frequency gets progressively higher than the
     resonant or natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller until the oscillations nearly
     disappear, and your finger simply moves up and down with little effect on the ball.

     FIGURE 15.29 The paddle ball on its rubber band moves in response to the finger supporting it. If the finger moves with the natural
     frequency of the ball on the rubber band, then a resonance is achieved, and the amplitude of the ball's oscillations increases
     dramatically. At higher and lower driving frequencies, energy is transferred to the ball less efficiently, and it responds with lower-amplitude
     oscillations.

Using Newton's second law       we can analyze the motion of the mass. The resulting equation is similar to

the force equation for the damped harmonic oscillator, with the addition of the driving force:

                                                                                                                   15.27

When an oscillator is forced with a periodic driving force, the motion may seem chaotic. The motions of the oscillator
is known as transients. After the transients die out, the oscillator reaches a steady state, where the motion is
periodic. After some time, the steady state solution to this differential equation is

                                                                                                                                                   15.28

Once again, it is left as an exercise to prove that this equation is a solution. Taking the first and second time

derivative of x(t) and substituting them into the force equation shows that                     is a solution as long

as the amplitude is equal to

                                                                                                                   15.29

where     is the natural frequency of the mass/spring system. Recall that the angular frequency, and

therefore the frequency, of the motor can be adjusted. Looking at the denominator of the equation for the amplitude,
when the driving frequency is much smaller, or much larger, than the natural frequency, the square of the difference

of the two angular frequencies  is positive and large, making the denominator large, and the result is a

small amplitude for the oscillations of the mass. As the frequency of the driving force approaches the natural

frequency of the system, the denominator becomes small and the amplitude of the oscillations becomes large. The

maximum amplitude results when the frequency of the driving force equals the natural frequency of the system

       .

Figure 15.31 shows a graph of the amplitude of a damped harmonic oscillator as a function of the frequency of the
periodic force driving it. Each of the three curves on the graph represents a different amount of damping. All three
curves peak at the point where the frequency of the driving force equals the natural frequency of the harmonic
oscillator. The highest peak, or greatest response, is for the least amount of damping, because less energy is
removed by the damping force. Note that since the amplitude grows as the damping decreases, taking this to the
738  15 · Oscillations

     limit where there is no damping  , the amplitude becomes infinite.

     Note that a small-amplitude driving force can produce a large-amplitude response. This phenomenon is known as
     resonance. A common example of resonance is a parent pushing a small child on a swing. When the child wants to
     go higher, the parent does not move back and then, getting a running start, slam into the child, applying a great force
     in a short interval. Instead, the parent applies small pushes to the child at just the right frequency, and the
     amplitude of the child's swings increases.

     FIGURE 15.31 Amplitude of a harmonic oscillator as a function of the frequency of the driving force. The curves represent the same
     oscillator with the same natural frequency but with different amounts of damping. Resonance occurs when the driving frequency equals the
     natural frequency, and the greatest response is for the least amount of damping. The narrowest response is also for the least damping.

     It is interesting to note that the widths of the resonance curves shown in Figure 15.31 depend on damping: the less
     the damping, the narrower the resonance. The consequence is that if you want a driven oscillator to resonate at a
     very specific frequency, you need as little damping as possible. For instance, a radio has a circuit that is used to
     choose a particular radio station. In this case, the forced damped oscillator consists of a resistor, capacitor, and
     inductor, which will be discussed later in this course. The circuit is "tuned" to pick a particular radio station. Here it
     is desirable to have the resonance curve be very narrow, to pick out the exact frequency of the radio station chosen.
     The narrowness of the graph, and the ability to pick out a certain frequency, is known as the quality of the system.
     The quality, Q, is defined as the spread of the angular frequency, or equivalently, as inverse of the fractional
     bandwidth, i.e., the natural frequency divided by the spread in the frequency at half the maximum amplitude

     as shown in Figure 15.32. For a small damping, the quality is approximately equal to  .

       FIGURE 15.32 The quality of a system is defined as the spread in the frequencies at half the amplitude divided by the natural frequency.

     These features of driven harmonic oscillators apply to a huge variety of systems. For instance, magnetic resonance
     imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei or protons)
     are made to resonate by incoming radio waves (on the order of 100 MHz). In all of these cases, the efficiency of

energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance. Figure 15.33 shows the London
Millennium Footbridge that allows pedestrians to cross the River Thames in London. This bridge was nicknamed
"Wobbly Bridge" when pedestrians experienced swaying motion while crossing it. The bridge was closed for roughly
two years to get rid of this motion.

FIGURE 15.33 Initially when people crossed the London Millennium Footbridge, they experienced a swaying motion. People continuing to
cross reinforced the oscillation's amplitude, thereby increasing the problematic swaying. (credit: Adrian Pingstone/Wikimedia Commons)

INTRODUCTION In this chapter, we study the physics of wave motion. We concentrate on mechanical waves, which
are disturbances that move through a medium such as air or water. Like simple harmonic motion studied in the
preceding chapter, the energy transferred through the medium is proportional to the amplitude squared. Surface
water waves in the ocean are transverse waves in which the energy of the wave travels horizontally while the water
oscillates up and down due to some restoring force. In the picture above, a buoy is used to convert the awesome
power of ocean waves into electricity. The up-and-down motion of the buoy generated as the waves pass is
converted into rotational motion that turns a rotor in an electric generator. The generator charges batteries, which
are in turn used to provide a consistent energy source for the end user. This model was successfully tested by the US
Navy in a project to provide power to coastal security networks and was able to provide an average power of 350 W.
The buoy survived the difficult ocean environment, including operation off the New Jersey coast through Hurricane
Irene in 2011.
The concepts presented in this chapter will be the foundation for many interesting topics, from the transmission of
information to the concepts of quantum mechanics.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the basic characteristics of wave motion
         · Define the terms wavelength, amplitude, period, frequency, and wave speed
         · Explain the difference between longitudinal and transverse waves, and give examples of each type
         · List the different types of waves

     We saw in Oscillations that oscillatory motion is an important type of behavior that can be used to model a wide
     range of physical phenomena. Oscillatory motion is also important because oscillations can generate waves, which
     are of fundamental importance in physics. Many of the terms and equations we studied in the chapter on oscillations
     apply equally well to wave motion (Figure 16.2).

     FIGURE 16.2 An ocean wave is probably the first picture that comes to mind when you hear the word "wave." Although this breaking wave,
     and ocean waves in general, have apparent similarities to the basic wave characteristics we will discuss, the mechanisms driving ocean
     waves are highly complex and beyond the scope of this chapter. It may seem natural, and even advantageous, to apply the concepts in this
     chapter to ocean waves, but ocean waves are nonlinear, and the simple models presented in this chapter do not fully explain them. (credit:

     Types of Waves

     A wave is a disturbance that propagates, or moves from the place it was created. There are three basic types of
     waves: mechanical waves, electromagnetic waves, and matter waves.

     Basic mechanical waves are governed by Newton's laws and require a medium. A medium is the substance
     mechanical waves propagate through, and the medium produces an elastic restoring force when it is deformed.
     Mechanical waves transfer energy and momentum, without transferring mass. Some examples of mechanical waves
     are water waves, sound waves, and seismic waves. The medium for water waves is water; for sound waves, the
     medium is usually air. (Sound waves can travel in other media as well; we will look at that in more detail in Sound.)
     For surface water waves, the disturbance occurs on the surface of the water, perhaps created by a rock thrown into
     a pond or by a swimmer splashing the surface repeatedly. For sound waves, the disturbance is a change in air
     pressure, perhaps created by the oscillating cone inside a speaker or a vibrating tuning fork. In both cases, the
     disturbance is the oscillation of the molecules of the fluid. In mechanical waves, energy and momentum transfer
     with the motion of the wave, whereas the mass oscillates around an equilibrium point. (We discuss this in Energy
     and Power of a Wave.) Earthquakes generate seismic waves from several types of disturbances, including the
     disturbance of Earth's surface and pressure disturbances under the surface. Seismic waves travel through the solids
     and liquids that form Earth. In this chapter, we focus on mechanical waves.

Electromagnetic waves are associated with oscillations in electric and magnetic fields and do not require a medium.

Examples include gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet waves, visible light, infrared waves, microwaves, and radio waves.

Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum at the speed of light,                  For

example, light from distant stars travels through the vacuum of space and reaches Earth. Electromagnetic waves

have some characteristics that are similar to mechanical waves; they are covered in more detail in Electromagnetic

Waves (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-2/pages/16-introduction).

Matter waves are a central part of the branch of physics known as quantum mechanics. These waves are associated
with protons, electrons, neutrons, and other fundamental particles found in nature. The theory that all types of
matter have wave-like properties was first proposed by Louis de Broglie in 1924. Matter waves are discussed in
Photons and Matter Waves (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/6-introduction).

Mechanical Waves

Mechanical waves exhibit characteristics common to all waves, such as amplitude, wavelength, period, frequency,
and energy. All wave characteristics can be described by a small set of underlying principles.

The simplest mechanical waves repeat themselves for several cycles and are associated with simple harmonic

motion. These simple harmonic waves can be modeled using some combination of sine and cosine functions. For

example, consider the simplified surface water wave that moves across the surface of water as illustrated in Figure

16.3. Unlike complex ocean waves, in surface water waves, the medium, in this case water, moves vertically,

oscillating up and down, whereas the disturbance of the wave moves horizontally through the medium. In Figure

16.3, the waves causes a seagull to move up and down in simple harmonic motion as the wave crests and troughs

(peaks and valleys) pass under the bird. The crest is the highest point of the wave, and the trough is the lowest part

of the wave. The time for one complete oscillation of the up-and-down motion is the wave's period T. The wave's

frequency is the number of waves that pass through a point per unit time and is equal to  The period can be

expressed using any convenient unit of time but is usually measured in seconds; frequency is usually measured in

hertz (Hz), where

The length of the wave is called the wavelength and is represented by the Greek letter lambda , which is
measured in any convenient unit of length, such as a centimeter or meter. The wavelength can be measured
between any two similar points along the medium that have the same height and the same slope. In Figure 16.3, the
wavelength is shown measured between two crests. As stated above, the period of the wave is equal to the time for
one oscillation, but it is also equal to the time for one wavelength to pass through a point along the wave's path.

The amplitude of the wave (A) is a measure of the maximum displacement of the medium from its equilibrium
position. In the figure, the equilibrium position is indicated by the dotted line, which is the height of the water if
there were no waves moving through it. In this case, the wave is symmetrical, the crest of the wave is a distance
above the equilibrium position, and the trough is a distance below the equilibrium position. The units for the
amplitude can be centimeters or meters, or any convenient unit of distance.

FIGURE 16.3 An idealized surface water wave passes under a seagull that bobs up and down in simple harmonic motion. The wave has a
752  16 · Waves

     wavelength , which is the distance between adjacent identical parts of the wave. The amplitude A of the wave is the maximum
     displacement of the wave from the equilibrium position, which is indicated by the dotted line. In this example, the medium moves up and
     down, whereas the disturbance of the surface propagates parallel to the surface at a speed v.

     The water wave in the figure moves through the medium with a propagation velocity The magnitude of the wave
     velocity is the distance the wave travels in a given time, which is one wavelength in the time of one period, and the
     wave speed is the magnitude of wave velocity. In equation form, this is

                                                                                                                                                          16.1

     This fundamental relationship holds for all types of waves. For water waves, v is the speed of a surface wave; for
     sound, v is the speed of sound; and for visible light, v is the speed of light.

     Transverse and Longitudinal Waves

     We have seen that a simple mechanical wave consists of a periodic disturbance that propagates from one place to
     another through a medium. In Figure 16.4(a), the wave propagates in the horizontal direction, whereas the medium
     is disturbed in the vertical direction. Such a wave is called a transverse wave. In a transverse wave, the wave may
     propagate in any direction, but the disturbance of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In
     contrast, in a longitudinal wave or compressional wave, the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation.
     Figure 16.4(b) shows an example of a longitudinal wave. The size of the disturbance is its amplitude A and is
     completely independent of the speed of propagation v.

     FIGURE 16.4 (a) In a transverse wave, the medium oscillates perpendicular to the wave velocity. Here, the spring moves vertically up and
     down, while the wave propagates horizontally to the right. (b) In a longitudinal wave, the medium oscillates parallel to the propagation of
     the wave. In this case, the spring oscillates back and forth, while the wave propagates to the right.

     A simple graphical representation of a section of the spring shown in Figure 16.4(b) is shown in Figure 16.5. Figure
     16.5(a) shows the equilibrium position of the spring before any waves move down it. A point on the spring is marked
     with a blue dot. Figure 16.5(b) through (g) show snapshots of the spring taken one-quarter of a period apart,
     sometime after the end of` the spring is oscillated back and forth in the x-direction at a constant frequency. The
     disturbance of the wave is seen as the compressions and the expansions of the spring. Note that the blue dot
     oscillates around its equilibrium position a distance A, as the longitudinal wave moves in the positive x-direction
     with a constant speed. The distance A is the amplitude of the wave. The y-position of the dot does not change as the
     wave moves through the spring. The wavelength of the wave is measured in part (d). The wavelength depends on
     the speed of the wave and the frequency of the driving force.

FIGURE 16.5 (a) This is a simple, graphical representation of a section of the stretched spring shown in Figure 16.4(b), representing the
spring's equilibrium position before any waves are induced on the spring. A point on the spring is marked by a blue dot. (b-g) Longitudinal
waves are created by oscillating the end of the spring (not shown) back and forth along the x-axis. The longitudinal wave, with a wavelength

 , moves along the spring in the +x-direction with a wave speed v. For convenience, the wavelength is measured in (d). Note that the point
on the spring that was marked with the blue dot moves back and forth a distance A from the equilibrium position, oscillating around the
equilibrium position of the point.

Waves may be transverse, longitudinal, or a combination of the two. Examples of transverse waves are the waves on
stringed instruments or surface waves on water, such as ripples moving on a pond. Sound waves in air and water are
longitudinal. With sound waves, the disturbances are periodic variations in pressure that are transmitted in fluids.
Fluids do not have appreciable shear strength, and for this reason, the sound waves in them are longitudinal waves.
Sound in solids can have both longitudinal and transverse components, such as those in a seismic wave.
Earthquakes generate seismic waves under Earth's surface with both longitudinal and transverse components
(called compressional or P-waves and shear or S-waves, respectively). The components of seismic waves have
important individual characteristics--they propagate at different speeds, for example. Earthquakes also have
surface waves that are similar to surface waves on water. Ocean waves also have both transverse and longitudinal
components.

        EXAMPLE 16.1

Wave on a String

A student takes a 30.00-m-long string and attaches one end to the wall in the physics lab. The student then holds
the free end of the rope, keeping the tension constant in the rope. The student then begins to send waves down the
string by moving the end of the string up and down with a frequency of 2.00 Hz. The maximum displacement of the
end of the string is 20.00 cm. The first wave hits the lab wall 6.00 s after it was created. (a) What is the speed of the
wave? (b) What is the period of the wave? (c) What is the wavelength of the wave?

Notice that each select point on the string (marked by colored dots) oscillates up and down in simple harmonic

motion, between  and                      with a period T. The wave on the string is sinusoidal and is translating in the

positive x-direction as time progresses.

At this point, it is useful to recall from your study of algebra that if f(x) is some function, then      is the same

function translated in the positive x-direction by a distance d. The function       is the same function translated

in the negative x-direction by a distance d. We want to define a wave function that will give the y-position of each

segment of the string for every position x along the string for every time t.

Looking at the first snapshot in Figure 16.9, the y-position of the string between                   and  can be modeled as

a sine function. This wave propagates down the string one wavelength in one period, as seen in the last snapshot.

The wave therefore moves with a constant wave speed of

The wave function above is derived using a sine function. Can a cosine function be used instead?

Velocity and Acceleration of the Medium

As seen in Example 16.4, the wave speed is constant and represents the speed of the wave as it propagates through
the medium, not the speed of the particles that make up the medium. The particles of the medium oscillate around
an equilibrium position as the wave propagates through the medium. In the case of the transverse wave propagating
in the x-direction, the particles oscillate up and down in the y-direction, perpendicular to the motion of the wave.
The velocity of the particles of the medium is not constant, which means there is an acceleration. The velocity of the
medium, which is perpendicular to the wave velocity in a transverse wave, can be found by taking the partial
derivative of the position equation with respect to time. The partial derivative is found by taking the derivative of the
function, treating all variables as constants, except for the variable in question. In the case of the partial derivative
with respect to time t, the position x is treated as a constant. Although this may sound strange if you haven't seen it
before, the object of this exercise is to find the transverse velocity at a point, so in this sense, the x-position is not
changing. We have

The magnitude of the maximum velocity of the medium is                                 . This may look familiar from the
Oscillations and a mass on a spring.

We can find the acceleration of the medium by taking the partial derivative of the velocity equation with respect to

     oscillate in simple harmonic motion for a mechanical wave.

     The Linear Wave Equation

     We have just determined the velocity of the medium at a position x by taking the partial derivative, with respect to
     time, of the position y. For a transverse wave, this velocity is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the
     wave. We found the acceleration by taking the partial derivative, with respect to time, of the velocity, which is the
     second time derivative of the position:

     Now consider the partial derivatives with respect to the other variable, the position x, holding the time constant. The
     first derivative is the slope of the wave at a point x at a time t,

     The second partial derivative expresses how the slope of the wave changes with respect to position--in other words,
     the curvature of the wave, where

     The ratio of the acceleration and the curvature leads to a very important relationship in physics known as the linear

     wave equation. Taking the ratio and using the equation        yields the linear wave equation (also known simply

     as the wave equation or the equation of a vibrating string),

                                                                                               16.6

     Equation 16.6 is the linear wave equation, which is one of the most important equations in physics and engineering.

     We derived it here for a transverse wave, but it is equally important when investigating longitudinal waves. This

     relationship was also derived using a sinusoidal wave, but it successfully describes any wave or pulse that has the

     form        These waves result due to a linear restoring force of the medium--thus, the name linear

     wave equation. Any wave function that satisfies this equation is a linear wave function.

     An interesting aspect of the linear wave equation is that if two wave functions are individually solutions to the linear

     wave equation, then the sum of the two linear wave functions is also a solution to the wave equation. Consider two

     transverse waves that propagate along the x-axis, occupying the same medium. Assume that the individual waves

     can be modeled with the wave functions                        and                         which are solutions to the

     linear wave equations and are therefore linear wave functions. The sum of the wave functions is the wave function

     Consider the linear wave equation:

     This has shown that if two linear wave functions are added algebraically, the resulting wave function is also linear.
     This wave function models the displacement of the medium of the resulting wave at each position along the x-axis.

If two linear waves occupy the same medium, they are said to interfere. If these waves can be modeled with a linear
wave function, these wave functions add to form the wave equation of the wave resulting from the interference of
the individual waves. The displacement of the medium at every point of the resulting wave is the algebraic sum of
the displacements due to the individual waves.

Taking this analysis a step further, if wave functions                and    are solutions to

the linear wave equation, then                          where A and B are constants, is also a solution to the linear

     16.3 Wave Speed on a Stretched String

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Determine the factors that affect the speed of a wave on a string
         · Write a mathematical expression for the speed of a wave on a string and generalize these concepts for

             other media

     The speed of a wave depends on the characteristics of the medium. For example, in the case of a guitar, the strings
     vibrate to produce the sound. The speed of the waves on the strings, and the wavelength, determine the frequency
     of the sound produced. The strings on a guitar have different thickness but may be made of similar material. They
     have different linear densities, where the linear density is defined as the mass per length,

                                                                                                                                                          16.7

     In this chapter, we consider only strings with a constant linear density. If the linear density is constant, then the

     mass        of a small length of string      is  For example, if the string has a length of 2.00 m and a

     mass of 0.06 kg, then the linear density is      If a 1.00-mm section is cut from the string, the

     mass of the 1.00-mm length is                                                The guitar also has a method

     to change the tension of the strings. The tension of the strings is adjusted by turning spindles, called the tuning
     pegs, around which the strings are wrapped. For the guitar, the linear density of the string and the tension in the
     string determine the speed of the waves in the string and the frequency of the sound produced is proportional to the
     wave speed.

     Wave Speed on a String under Tension

     To see how the speed of a wave on a string depends on the tension and the linear density, consider a pulse sent

     down a taut string (Figure 16.13). When the taut string is at rest at the equilibrium position, the tension in the string

     is constant. Consider a small element of the string with a mass equal to     The mass element is at rest

     and in equilibrium and the force of tension of either side of the mass element is equal and opposite.

acting on either side of the mass element is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

If you pluck a string under tension, a transverse wave moves in the positive x-direction, as shown in Figure 16.14.
The mass element is small but is enlarged in the figure to make it visible. The small mass element oscillates
perpendicular to the wave motion as a result of the restoring force provided by the string and does not move in the
x-direction. The tension in the string, which acts in the positive and negative x-direction, is approximately
constant and is independent of position and time.

FIGURE 16.14 A string under tension is plucked, causing a pulse to move along the string in the positive x-direction.

Assume that the inclination of the displaced string with respect to the horizontal axis is small. The net force on the
element of the string, acting parallel to the string, is the sum of the tension in the string and the restoring force. The
x-components of the force of tension cancel, so the net force is equal to the sum of the y-components of the force.
The magnitude of the x-component of the force is equal to the horizontal force of tension of the string as shown

in Figure 16.14. To obtain the y-components of the force, note that  and  The                                          is

Therefore, is equal to the negative slope of the string at and is equal to the slope of the string at

The net force on the small mass element can be written as

Using Newton's second law, the net force is equal to the mass times the acceleration. The linear density of the string

     The Wave Speed of a Guitar String

     On a six-string guitar, the high E string has a linear density of              and the low E string has

     a linear density of                                (a) If the high E string is plucked, producing a wave in the string,

     what is the speed of the wave if the tension of the string is 56.40 N? (b) The linear density of the low E string is

     approximately 20 times greater than that of the high E string. For waves to travel through the low E string at the

     same wave speed as the high E, would the tension need to be larger or smaller than the high E string? What would

     be the approximate tension? (c) Calculate the tension of the low E string needed for the same wave speed.

Significance
The standard notes of the six string (high E, B, G, D, A, low E) are tuned to vibrate at the fundamental frequencies
(329.63 Hz, 246.94Hz, 196.00Hz, 146.83Hz, 110.00Hz, and 82.41Hz) when plucked. The frequencies depend on
the speed of the waves on the string and the wavelength of the waves. The six strings have different linear densities
and are "tuned" by changing the tensions in the strings. We will see in Interference of Waves that the wavelength
depends on the length of the strings and the boundary conditions. To play notes other than the fundamental notes,
the lengths of the strings are changed by pressing down on the strings.

The wave speed of a wave on a string depends on the tension and the linear mass density. If the tension is doubled,
what happens to the speed of the waves on the string?

Speed of Compression Waves in a Fluid

The speed of a wave on a string depends on the square root of the tension divided by the mass per length, the linear
density. In general, the speed of a wave through a medium depends on the elastic property of the medium and the
inertial property of the medium.

The elastic property describes the tendency of the particles of the medium to return to their initial position when
perturbed. The inertial property describes the tendency of the particle to resist changes in velocity.
The speed of a longitudinal wave through a liquid or gas depends on the density of the fluid and the bulk modulus of
the fluid,

                                                                                                                                                     16.9

Here the bulk modulus is defined as      where is the change in the pressure and the denominator is

the ratio of the change in volume to the initial volume, and  is the mass per unit volume. For example, sound

is a mechanical wave that travels through a fluid or a solid. The speed of sound in air with an atmospheric pressure

of  and a temperature of             is                       Because the density depends on temperature,

the speed of sound in air depends on the temperature of the air. This will be discussed in detail in Sound.

16.4 Energy and Power of a Wave

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain how energy travels with a pulse or wave
    · Describe, using a mathematical expression, how the energy in a wave depends on the amplitude of the

        wave

All waves carry energy, and sometimes this can be directly observed. Earthquakes can shake whole cities to the
ground, performing the work of thousands of wrecking balls (Figure 16.15). Loud sounds can pulverize nerve cells in
the inner ear, causing permanent hearing loss. Ultrasound is used for deep-heat treatment of muscle strains. A laser
768  16 · Waves

     beam can burn away a malignancy. Water waves chew up beaches.

     FIGURE 16.15 The destructive effect of an earthquake is observable evidence of the energy carried in these waves. The Richter scale rating
     of earthquakes is a logarithmic scale related to both their amplitude and the energy they carry.

     In this section, we examine the quantitative expression of energy in waves. This will be of fundamental importance
     in later discussions of waves, from sound to light to quantum mechanics.

     Energy in Waves

     The amount of energy in a wave is related to its amplitude and its frequency. Large-amplitude earthquakes produce
     large ground displacements. Loud sounds have high-pressure amplitudes and come from larger-amplitude source
     vibrations than soft sounds. Large ocean breakers churn up the shore more than small ones. Consider the example
     of the seagull and the water wave earlier in the chapter (Figure 16.3). Work is done on the seagull by the wave as the
     seagull is moved up, changing its potential energy. The larger the amplitude, the higher the seagull is lifted by the
     wave and the larger the change in potential energy.

     The energy of the wave depends on both the amplitude and the frequency. If the energy of each wavelength is
     considered to be a discrete packet of energy, a high-frequency wave will deliver more of these packets per unit time
     than a low-frequency wave. We will see that the average rate of energy transfer in mechanical waves is proportional
     to both the square of the amplitude and the square of the frequency. If two mechanical waves have equal
     amplitudes, but one wave has a frequency equal to twice the frequency of the other, the higher-frequency wave will
     have a rate of energy transfer a factor of four times as great as the rate of energy transfer of the lower-frequency
     wave. It should be noted that although the rate of energy transport is proportional to both the square of the
     amplitude and square of the frequency in mechanical waves, the rate of energy transfer in electromagnetic waves is
     proportional to the square of the amplitude, but independent of the frequency.

     Power in Waves

     Consider a sinusoidal wave on a string that is produced by a string vibrator, as shown in Figure 16.16. The string

     vibrator is a device that vibrates a rod up and down. A string of uniform linear mass density is attached to the rod,

     and the rod oscillates the string, producing a sinusoidal wave. The rod does work on the string, producing energy

     that propagates along the string. Consider a mass element of the string with a mass , as seen in Figure 16.16. As

     the energy propagates along the string, each mass element of the string is driven up and down at the same

     frequency as the wave. Each mass element of the string can be modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator. Since the

     string has a constant linear density  each mass element of the string has the mass

FIGURE 16.16 A string vibrator is a device that vibrates a rod. A string is attached to the rod, and the rod does work on the string, driving
the string up and down. This produces a sinusoidal wave in the string, which moves with a wave velocity v. The wave speed depends on the
tension in the string and the linear mass density of the string. A section of the string with mass oscillates at the same frequency as the
wave.

The total mechanical energy of the wave is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy

            of each mass element of the string of length is       as the mass element oscillates

perpendicular to the direction of the motion of the wave. Using the constant linear mass density, the kinetic energy
of each mass element of the string with length is

A differential equation can be formed by letting the length of the mass element of the string approach zero,

Since the wave is a sinusoidal wave with an angular frequency the position of each mass element may be

modeled as  Each mass element of the string oscillates with a velocity

            The kinetic energy of each mass element of the string becomes

The wave can be very long, consisting of many wavelengths. To standardize the energy, consider the kinetic energy
associated with a wavelength of the wave. This kinetic energy can be integrated over the wavelength to find the
energy associated with each wavelength of the wave:

There is also potential energy associated with the wave. Much like the mass oscillating on a spring, there is a
conservative restoring force that, when the mass element is displaced from the equilibrium position, drives the
mass element back to the equilibrium position. The potential energy of the mass element can be found by
considering the linear restoring force of the string, In Oscillations, we saw that the potential energy stored in a

spring with a linear restoring force is equal to  where the equilibrium position is defined as

When a mass attached to the spring oscillates in simple harmonic motion, the angular frequency is equal to

            As each mass element oscillates in simple harmonic motion, the spring constant is equal to

            The potential energy of the mass element is equal to

Note that is the spring constant and not the wave number          This equation can be used to find the energy

over a wavelength. Integrating over the wavelength, we can compute the potential energy over a wavelength:
770  16 · Waves

     The potential energy associated with a wavelength of the wave is equal to the kinetic energy associated with a
     wavelength.

     The total energy associated with a wavelength is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy:

     The time-averaged power of a sinusoidal mechanical wave, which is the average rate of energy transfer associated
     with a wave as it passes a point, can be found by taking the total energy associated with the wave divided by the
     time it takes to transfer the energy. If the velocity of the sinusoidal wave is constant, the time for one wavelength to
     pass by a point is equal to the period of the wave, which is also constant. For a sinusoidal mechanical wave, the
     time-averaged power is therefore the energy associated with a wavelength divided by the period of the wave. The
     wavelength of the wave divided by the period is equal to the velocity of the wave,

                                                                                                                                                        16.10

     Note that this equation for the time-averaged power of a sinusoidal mechanical wave shows that the power is

     proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave and to the square of the angular frequency of the wave.

     Recall that the angular frequency is equal to  , so the power of a mechanical wave is equal to the square of

     the amplitude and the square of the frequency of the wave.

     EXAMPLE 16.6

     Power Supplied by a String Vibrator

     Consider a two-meter-long string with a mass of 70.00 g attached to a string vibrator as illustrated in Figure 16.16.
     The tension in the string is 90.0 N. When the string vibrator is turned on, it oscillates with a frequency of 60 Hz and
     produces a sinusoidal wave on the string with an amplitude of 4.00 cm and a constant wave speed. What is the
     time-averaged power supplied to the wave by the string vibrator?

     Strategy

     The power supplied to the wave should equal the time-averaged power of the wave on the string. We know the mass

     of the string , the length of the string , and the tension          in the string. The speed of the wave on the

     string can be derived from the linear mass density and the tension. The string oscillates with the same frequency as

     the string vibrator, from which we can find the angular frequency.

     Solution

     1. Begin with the equation of the time-averaged power of a sinusoidal wave on a string:

          The amplitude is given, so we need to calculate the linear mass density of the string, the angular frequency of
          the wave on the string, and the speed of the wave on the string.
     2. We need to calculate the linear density to find the wave speed:

     3. The wave speed can be found using the linear mass density and the tension of the string:

4. The angular frequency can be found from the frequency:
5. Calculate the time-averaged power:

Significance

The time-averaged power of a sinusoidal wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave and the
square of the angular frequency of the wave. This is true for most mechanical waves. If either the angular frequency
or the amplitude of the wave were doubled, the power would increase by a factor of four. The time-averaged power
of the wave on a string is also proportional to the speed of the sinusoidal wave on the string. If the speed were
doubled, by increasing the tension by a factor of four, the power would also be doubled.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 16.6

Is the time-averaged power of a sinusoidal wave on a string proportional to the linear density of the string?

The equations for the energy of the wave and the time-averaged power were derived for a sinusoidal wave on a
string. In general, the energy of a mechanical wave and the power are proportional to the amplitude squared and to
the angular frequency squared (and therefore the frequency squared).
Another important characteristic of waves is the intensity of the waves. Waves can also be concentrated or spread
out. Waves from an earthquake, for example, spread out over a larger area as they move away from a source, so they
do less damage the farther they get from the source. Changing the area the waves cover has important effects. All
these pertinent factors are included in the definition of intensity (I) as power per unit area:

                                                                                                                                                   16.11

where P is the power carried by the wave through area A. The definition of intensity is valid for any energy in transit,
including that carried by waves. The SI unit for intensity is watts per square meter (W/m2). Many waves are

spherical waves that move out from a source as a sphere. For example, a sound speaker mounted on a post above

the ground may produce sound waves that move away from the source as a spherical wave. Sound waves are

discussed in more detail in the next chapter, but in general, the farther you are from the speaker, the less intense the

sound you hear. As a spherical wave moves out from a source, the surface area of the wave increases as the radius

increases  The intensity for a spherical wave is therefore

                                                                                                        16.12

If there are no dissipative forces, the energy will remain constant as the spherical wave moves away from the
source, but the intensity will decrease as the surface area increases.

In the case of the two-dimensional circular wave, the wave moves out, increasing the circumference of the wave as
the radius of the circle increases. If you toss a pebble in a pond, the surface ripple moves out as a circular wave. As
the ripple moves away from the source, the amplitude decreases. The energy of the wave spreads around a larger
circumference and the intensity decreases proportional to which is also the same in the case of a spherical wave,
since intensity is proportional to the amplitude squared.

     16.5 Interference of Waves

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how mechanical waves are reflected and transmitted at the boundaries of a medium
         · Define the terms interference and superposition
         · Find the resultant wave of two identical sinusoidal waves that differ only by a phase shift

     Up to now, we have been studying mechanical waves that propagate continuously through a medium, but we have
     not discussed what happens when waves encounter the boundary of the medium or what happens when a wave
     encounters another wave propagating through the same medium. Waves do interact with boundaries of the medium,
     and all or part of the wave can be reflected. For example, when you stand some distance from a rigid cliff face and
     yell, you can hear the sound waves reflect off the rigid surface as an echo. Waves can also interact with other waves
     propagating in the same medium. If you throw two rocks into a pond some distance from one another, the circular
     ripples that result from the two stones seem to pass through one another as they propagate out from where the
     stones entered the water. This phenomenon is known as interference. In this section, we examine what happens to
     waves encountering a boundary of a medium or another wave propagating in the same medium. We will see that
     their behavior is quite different from the behavior of particles and rigid bodies. Later, when we study modern
     physics, we will see that only at the scale of atoms do we see similarities in the properties of waves and particles.

     Reflection and Transmission

     When a wave propagates through a medium, it reflects when it encounters the boundary of the medium. The wave
     before hitting the boundary is known as the incident wave. The wave after encountering the boundary is known as
     the reflected wave. How the wave is reflected at the boundary of the medium depends on the boundary conditions;
     waves will react differently if the boundary of the medium is fixed in place or free to move (Figure 16.17). A fixed
     boundary condition exists when the medium at a boundary is fixed in place so it cannot move. A free boundary
     condition exists when the medium at the boundary is free to move.

     FIGURE 16.17 (a) One end of a string is fixed so that it cannot move. A wave propagating on the string, encountering this fixed boundary

     condition, is reflected          out of phase with respect to the incident wave. (b) One end of a string is tied to a solid ring of negligible

     mass on a frictionless lab pole, where the ring is free to move. A wave propagating on the string, encountering this free boundary condition,

     is reflected in phase    with respect to the wave.

     Part (a) of the Figure 16.17 shows a fixed boundary condition. Here, one end of the string is fixed to a wall so the end
     of the string is fixed in place and the medium (the string) at the boundary cannot move. When the wave is reflected,

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                        16.5 · Interference of Waves                             773

the amplitude of the reflected wave is exactly the same as the amplitude of the incident wave, but the reflected

wave is reflected  out of phase with respect to the incident wave. The phase change can be explained

using Newton's third law: Recall that Newton's third law states that when object A exerts a force on object B, then

object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A. As the incident wave encounters the wall, the string exerts

an upward force on the wall and the wall reacts by exerting an equal and opposite force on the string. The reflection

at a fixed boundary is inverted. Note that the figure shows a crest of the incident wave reflected as a trough. If the

incident wave were a trough, the reflected wave would be a crest.

Part (b) of the figure shows a free boundary condition. Here, one end of the string is tied to a solid ring of negligible
mass on a frictionless pole, so the end of the string is free to move up and down. As the incident wave encounters
the boundary of the medium, it is also reflected. In the case of a free boundary condition, the reflected wave is in
phase with respect to the incident wave. In this case, the wave encounters the free boundary applying an upward
force on the ring, accelerating the ring up. The ring travels up to the maximum height equal to the amplitude of the
wave and then accelerates down towards the equilibrium position due to the tension in the string. The figure shows
the crest of an incident wave being reflected in phase with respect to the incident wave as a crest. If the incident
wave were a trough, the reflected wave would also be a trough. The amplitude of the reflected wave would be equal
to the amplitude of the incident wave.

In some situations, the boundary of the medium is neither fixed nor free. Consider Figure 16.18(a), where a low-
linear mass density string is attached to a string of a higher linear mass density. In this case, the reflected wave is
out of phase with respect to the incident wave. There is also a transmitted wave that is in phase with respect to the
incident wave. Both the transmitted and the reflected waves have amplitudes less than the amplitude of the
incident wave. If the tension is the same in both strings, the wave speed is higher in the string with the lower linear
mass density.

FIGURE 16.18 Waves traveling along two types of strings: a thick string with a high linear density and a thin string with a low linear density.

Both strings are under the same tension, so a wave moves faster on the low-density string than on the high-density string. (a) A wave

moving from a low-density to a high-density medium results in a reflected wave that is  out of phase with respect to the

incident pulse (or wave) and a transmitted wave that is in phase with the incident wave. (b) When a wave moves from a high-density

medium to a low-density medium, both the reflected and transmitted wave are in phase with respect to the incident wave.

Part (b) of the figure shows a high-linear mass density string is attached to a string of a lower linear density. In this
case, the reflected wave is in phase with respect to the incident wave. There is also a transmitted wave that is in
phase with respect to the incident wave. Both the incident and the reflected waves have amplitudes less than the
774  16 · Waves

     amplitude of the incident wave. Here you may notice that if the tension is the same in both strings, the wave speed
     is higher in the string with the lower linear mass density.

     Superposition and Interference

     Most waves do not look very simple. Complex waves are more interesting, even beautiful, but they look formidable.
     Most interesting mechanical waves consist of a combination of two or more traveling waves propagating in the same
     medium. The principle of superposition can be used to analyze the combination of waves.

     Consider two simple pulses of the same amplitude moving toward one another in the same medium, as shown in
     Figure 16.19. Eventually, the waves overlap, producing a wave that has twice the amplitude, and then continue on
     unaffected by the encounter. The pulses are said to interfere, and this phenomenon is known as interference.

     FIGURE 16.19 Two pulses moving toward one another experience interference. The term interference refers to what happens when two
     waves overlap.

     To analyze the interference of two or more waves, we use the principle of superposition. For mechanical waves, the
     principle of superposition states that if two or more traveling waves combine at the same point, the resulting
     position of the mass element of the medium, at that point, is the algebraic sum of the position due to the individual
     waves. This property is exhibited by many waves observed, such as waves on a string, sound waves, and surface
     water waves. Electromagnetic waves also obey the superposition principle, but the electric and magnetic fields of
     the combined wave are added instead of the displacement of the medium. Waves that obey the superposition
     principle are linear waves; waves that do not obey the superposition principle are said to be nonlinear waves. In this
     chapter, we deal with linear waves, in particular, sinusoidal waves.

     The superposition principle can be understood by considering the linear wave equation. In Mathematics of a Wave,
     we defined a linear wave as a wave whose mathematical representation obeys the linear wave equation. For a
     transverse wave on a string with an elastic restoring force, the linear wave equation is

Any wave function                         where the argument of the function is linear  is a solution to the

linear wave equation and is a linear wave function. If wave functions  and              are solutions to the linear

wave equation, the sum of the two functions                 is also a solution to the linear wave equation.

Mechanical waves that obey superposition are normally restricted to waves with amplitudes that are small with

respect to their wavelengths. If the amplitude is too large, the medium is distorted past the region where the

restoring force of the medium is linear.

Waves can interfere constructively or destructively. Figure 16.20 shows two identical sinusoidal waves that arrive at
the same point exactly in phase. Figure 16.20(a) and (b) show the two individual waves, Figure 16.20(c) shows the
resultant wave that results from the algebraic sum of the two linear waves. The crests of the two waves are precisely
aligned, as are the troughs. This superposition produces constructive interference. Because the disturbances add,
constructive interference produces a wave that has twice the amplitude of the individual waves, but has the same
wavelength.

Figure 16.21 shows two identical waves that arrive exactly  out of phase, producing destructive interference.

Figure 16.21(a) and (b) show the individual waves, and Figure 16.21(c) shows the superposition of the two waves.

Because the troughs of one wave add the crest of the other wave, the resulting amplitude is zero for destructive

interference--the waves completely cancel.

     When linear waves interfere, the resultant wave is just the algebraic sum of the individual waves as stated in the
     principle of superposition. Figure 16.22 shows two waves (red and blue) and the resultant wave (black). The

represent the height of the wave at each point. The waves may be any linear wave, including ripples on a pond, disturbances on a string,
sound, or electromagnetic waves.

The superposition of most waves produces a combination of constructive and destructive interference, and can vary
from place to place and time to time. Sound from a stereo, for example, can be loud in one spot and quiet in another.
Varying loudness means the sound waves add partially constructively and partially destructively at different
locations. A stereo has at least two speakers creating sound waves, and waves can reflect from walls. All these
waves interfere, and the resulting wave is the superposition of the waves.
We have shown several examples of the superposition of waves that are similar. Figure 16.23 illustrates an example
of the superposition of two dissimilar waves. Here again, the disturbances add, producing a resultant wave.

     At times, when two or more mechanical waves interfere, the pattern produced by the resulting wave can be rich in
     complexity, some without any readily discernable patterns. For example, plotting the sound wave of your favorite
     music can look quite complex and is the superposition of the individual sound waves from many instruments; it is
     the complexity that makes the music interesting and worth listening to. At other times, waves can interfere and
     produce interesting phenomena, which are complex in their appearance and yet beautiful in simplicity of the
     physical principle of superposition, which formed the resulting wave. One example is the phenomenon known as
     standing waves, produced by two identical waves moving in different directions. We will look more closely at this
     phenomenon in the next section.

     Superposition of Sinusoidal Waves that Differ by a Phase Shift

     Many examples in physics consist of two sinusoidal waves that are identical in amplitude, wave number, and angular
     frequency, but differ by a phase shift:

     When these two waves exist in the same medium, the resultant wave resulting from the superposition of the two
     individual waves is the sum of the two individual waves:

     The resultant wave can be better understood by using the trigonometric identity:

     where       and                      . The resulting wave becomes

     This equation is usually written as

                                                                                                                     16.13

     The resultant wave has the same wave number and angular frequency, an amplitude of                              and

     a phase shift equal to half the original phase shift. Examples of waves that differ only in a phase shift are shown in

     Figure 16.24. The red and blue waves each have the same amplitude, wave number, and angular frequency, and

     differ only in a phase shift. They therefore have the same period, wavelength, and frequency. The green wave is the

     result of the superposition of the two waves. When the two waves have a phase difference of zero, the waves are in

     phase, and the resultant wave has the same wave number and angular frequency, and an amplitude equal to twice

     the individual amplitudes (part (a)). This is constructive interference. If the phase difference is  the waves

     interfere in destructive interference (part (c)). The resultant wave has an amplitude of zero. Any other phase

16.6 Standing Waves and Resonance

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe standing waves and explain how they are produced
    · Describe the modes of a standing wave on a string
    · Provide examples of standing waves beyond the waves on a string

Throughout this chapter, we have been studying traveling waves, or waves that transport energy from one place to
another. Under certain conditions, waves can bounce back and forth through a particular region, effectively
becoming stationary. These are called standing waves.

Another related effect is known as resonance. In Oscillations, we defined resonance as a phenomenon in which a
small-amplitude driving force could produce large-amplitude motion. Think of a child on a swing, which can be
modeled as a physical pendulum. Relatively small-amplitude pushes by a parent can produce large-amplitude
swings. Sometimes this resonance is good--for example, when producing music with a stringed instrument. At other
780  16 · Waves

     times, the effects can be devastating, such as the collapse of a building during an earthquake. In the case of
     standing waves, the relatively large amplitude standing waves are produced by the superposition of smaller
     amplitude component waves.

     Standing Waves

     Sometimes waves do not seem to move; rather, they just vibrate in place. You can see unmoving waves on the
     surface of a glass of milk in a refrigerator, for example. Vibrations from the refrigerator motor create waves on the
     milk that oscillate up and down but do not seem to move across the surface. Figure 16.25 shows an experiment you
     can try at home. Take a bowl of milk and place it on a common box fan. Vibrations from the fan will produce circular
     standing waves in the milk. The waves are visible in the photo due to the reflection from a lamp. These waves are
     formed by the superposition of two or more traveling waves, such as illustrated in Figure 16.26 for two identical
     waves moving in opposite directions. The waves move through each other with their disturbances adding as they go
     by. If the two waves have the same amplitude and wavelength, then they alternate between constructive and
     destructive interference. The resultant looks like a wave standing in place and, thus, is called a standing wave.

     FIGURE 16.25 Standing waves are formed on the surface of a bowl of milk sitting on a box fan. The vibrations from the fan causes the
     surface of the milk to oscillate. The waves are visible due to the reflection of light from a lamp. (credit: David Chelton)

FIGURE 16.26 Time snapshots of two sine waves. The red wave is moving in the -x-direction and the blue wave is moving in the

that the resultant wave always equals zero at these points, no matter what the time is. These points are known as fixed points (nodes). In

between each two nodes is an antinode, a place where the medium oscillates with an amplitude equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the

individual waves.

Consider two identical waves that move in opposite directions. The first wave has a wave function of

                   and the second wave has a wave function                                     . The waves

     This can be simplified using the trigonometric identity

     where       and       , giving us

     which simplifies to

                                                                                                                    16.14

     Notice that the resultant wave is a sine wave that is a function only of position, multiplied by a cosine function that is
     a function only of time. Graphs of y(x,t) as a function of x for various times are shown in Figure 16.26. The red wave
     moves in the negative x-direction, the blue wave moves in the positive x-direction, and the black wave is the sum of
     the two waves. As the red and blue waves move through each other, they move in and out of constructive
     interference and destructive interference.

     Initially, at time   the two waves are in phase, and the result is a wave that is twice the amplitude of the

     individual waves. The waves are also in phase at the time       In fact, the waves are in phase at any integer

     multiple of half of a period:

     At other times, the two waves are        out of phase, and the resulting wave is equal to zero. This
     happens at

     Notice that some x-positions of the resultant wave are always zero no matter what the phase relationship is. These
     positions are called nodes. Where do the nodes occur? Consider the solution to the sum of the two waves

     Finding the positions where the sine function equals zero provides the positions of the nodes.

     There are also positions where y oscillates between        . These are the antinodes. We can find them by

     considering which values of x result in              .

     What results is a standing wave as shown in Figure 16.27, which shows snapshots of the resulting wave of two

     identical waves moving in opposite directions. The resulting wave appears to be a sine wave with nodes at integer

     multiples of half wavelengths. The antinodes oscillate between  due to the cosine term,  , which

     oscillates between .

     The resultant wave appears to be standing still, with no apparent movement in the x-direction, although it is

composed of one wave function moving in the positive, whereas the second wave is moving in the negative
x-direction. Figure 16.27 shows various snapshots of the resulting wave. The nodes are marked with red dots while
the antinodes are marked with blue dots.

multiples of half wavelengths. Antinodes appear at odd multiples of quarter wavelengths, where they oscillate between         The nodes

A common example of standing waves are the waves produced by stringed musical instruments. When the string is
plucked, pulses travel along the string in opposite directions. The ends of the strings are fixed in place, so nodes
appear at the ends of the strings--the boundary conditions of the system, regulating the resonant frequencies in the
strings. The resonance produced on a string instrument can be modeled in a physics lab using the apparatus shown
in Figure 16.28.

FIGURE 16.28 A lab setup for creating standing waves on a string. The string has a node on each end and a constant linear density. The
length between the fixed boundary conditions is L. The hanging mass provides the tension in the string, and the speed of the waves on the
string is proportional to the square root of the tension divided by the linear mass density.

The lab setup shows a string attached to a string vibrator, which oscillates the string with an adjustable frequency f.
The other end of the string passes over a frictionless pulley and is tied to a hanging mass. The magnitude of the
tension in the string is equal to the weight of the hanging mass. The string has a constant linear density (mass per

length) and the speed at which a wave travels down the string equals                          Equation 16.7. The

symmetrical boundary conditions (a node at each end) dictate the possible frequencies that can excite standing

waves. Starting from a frequency of zero and slowly increasing the frequency, the first mode  appears as

shown in Figure 16.29. The first mode, also called the fundamental mode or the first harmonic, shows half of a

wavelength has formed, so the wavelength is equal to twice the length between the nodes                                . The

fundamental frequency, or first harmonic frequency, that drives this mode is

where the speed of the wave is  Keeping the tension constant and increasing the frequency leads to the

second harmonic or the  mode. This mode is a full wavelength           and the frequency is twice the

     fundamental frequency:

     visualization. The standing wave patterns possible on the string are known as the normal modes. Conducting this experiment in the lab
     would result in a decrease in amplitude as the frequency increases.)

     overtones. The equations for the wavelength and the frequency can be summarized as:

                                                                                                               16.15

     The standing wave patterns that are possible for a string, the first four of which are shown in Figure 16.29, are

     known as the normal modes, with frequencies known as the normal frequencies. In summary, the first frequency to

     produce a normal mode is called the fundamental frequency (or first harmonic). Any frequencies above the

     fundamental frequency are overtones. The second frequency of the  normal mode of the string is the first

     overtone (or second harmonic). The frequency of the     normal mode is the second overtone (or third harmonic)

     and so on.

     The solutions shown as Equation 16.15 and Equation 16.16 are for a string with the boundary condition of a node on
     each end. When the boundary condition on either side is the same, the system is said to have symmetric boundary
     conditions. Equation 16.15 and Equation 16.16 are good for any symmetric boundary conditions, that is, nodes at
     both ends or antinodes at both ends.

negligible mass, and the tension is provided by a 2.00-kg hanging mass. (a) What is the velocity of the waves on the

and label each with the wavelength. (c) List the frequencies that the string vibrator must be tuned to in order to

Strategy

a. The velocity of the wave can be found using  The tension is provided by the weight of the hanging

     mass.
b. The standing waves will depend on the boundary conditions. There must be a node at each end. The first

     mode will be one half of a wave. The second can be found by adding a half wavelength. That is the shortest
     length that will result in a node at the boundaries. For example, adding one quarter of a wavelength will result
     in an antinode at the boundary and is not a mode which would satisfy the boundary conditions. This is shown
     in Figure 16.31.
c. Since the wave speed velocity is the wavelength times the frequency, the frequency is wave speed divided by
     the wavelength.

         FIGURE 16.31 (a) The figure represents the second mode of the string that satisfies the boundary conditions of a node at each end
         of the string. (b)This figure could not possibly be a normal mode on the string because it does not satisfy the boundary conditions.
         There is a node on one end, but an antinode on the other.

Solution
  a. Begin with the velocity of a wave on a string. The tension is equal to the weight of the hanging mass. The linear
        mass density and mass of the hanging mass are given:

  b. The first normal mode that has a node on each end is a half wavelength. The next two modes are found by
        adding a half of a wavelength.

        c. The frequencies of the first three modes are found by using

     Significance
     The three standing modes in this example were produced by maintaining the tension in the string and adjusting the
     driving frequency. Keeping the tension in the string constant results in a constant velocity. The same modes could
     have been produced by keeping the frequency constant and adjusting the speed of the wave in the string (by
     changing the hanging mass.)

     The equations for the wavelengths and the frequencies of the modes of a wave produced on a string:

     were derived by considering a wave on a string where there were symmetric boundary conditions of a node at each
     end. These modes resulted from two sinusoidal waves with identical characteristics except they were moving in
     opposite directions, confined to a region L with nodes required at both ends. Will the same equations work if there
     were symmetric boundary conditions with antinodes at each end? What would the normal modes look like for a
     medium that was free to oscillate on each end? Don't worry for now if you cannot imagine such a medium, just
     consider two sinusoidal wave functions in a region of length L, with antinodes on each end.

metallic rods (shown in red) attached to two supports (shown in blue). In part (a), the rod is supported at the ends,
and there are fixed boundary conditions at both ends. Given the proper frequency, the rod can be driven into
resonance with a wavelength equal to length of the rod, with nodes at each end. In part (b), the rod is supported at
positions one quarter of the length from each end of the rod, and there are free boundary conditions at both ends.
Given the proper frequency, this rod can also be driven into resonance with a wavelength equal to the length of the
rod, but there are antinodes at each end. If you are having trouble visualizing the wavelength in this figure,
remember that the wavelength may be measured between any two nearest identical points and consider Figure
16.33.

FIGURE 16.32 (a) A metallic rod of length L (red) supported by two supports (blue) on each end. When driven at the proper frequency, the
rod can resonate with a wavelength equal to the length of the rod with a node on each end. (b) The same metallic rod of length L (red)
supported by two supports (blue) at a position a quarter of the length of the rod from each end. When driven at the proper frequency, the
rod can resonate with a wavelength equal to the length of the rod with an antinode on each end.

FIGURE 16.33 A wavelength may be measure between the nearest two repeating points. On the wave on a string, this means the same
height and slope. (a) The wavelength is measured between the two nearest points where the height is zero and the slope is maximum and
positive. (b) The wavelength is measured between two identical points where the height is maximum and the slope is zero.

Note that the study of standing waves can become quite complex. In Figure 16.32(a), the        mode of the

standing wave is shown, and it results in a wavelength equal to L. In this configuration, the  mode would also

have been possible with a standing wave equal to 2L. Is it possible to get the  mode for the configuration

shown in part (b)? The answer is no. In this configuration, there are additional conditions set beyond the boundary

conditions. Since the rod is mounted at a point one quarter of the length from each side, a node must exist there,

and this limits the possible modes of standing waves that can be created. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to

consider if other modes of standing waves are possible. It should be noted that when a system is driven at a

frequency that does not cause the system to resonate, vibrations may still occur, but the amplitude of the vibrations

will be much smaller than the amplitude at resonance.

A field of mechanical engineering uses the sound produced by the vibrating parts of complex mechanical systems to
troubleshoot problems with the systems. Suppose a part in an automobile is resonating at the frequency of the car's
engine, causing unwanted vibrations in the automobile. This may cause the engine to fail prematurely. The
engineers use microphones to record the sound produced by the engine, then use a technique called Fourier
788  16 · Waves

     analysis to find frequencies of sound produced with large amplitudes and then look at the parts list of the
     automobile to find a part that would resonate at that frequency. The solution may be as simple as changing the
     composition of the material used or changing the length of the part in question.

     There are other numerous examples of resonance in standing waves in the physical world. The air in a tube, such as
     found in a musical instrument like a flute, can be forced into resonance and produce a pleasant sound, as we
     discuss in Sound.

     At other times, resonance can cause serious problems. A closer look at earthquakes provides evidence for
     conditions appropriate for resonance, standing waves, and constructive and destructive interference. A building may
     vibrate for several seconds with a driving frequency matching that of the natural frequency of vibration of the
     building--producing a resonance resulting in one building collapsing while neighboring buildings do not. Often,
     buildings of a certain height are devastated while other taller buildings remain intact. The building height matches
     the condition for setting up a standing wave for that particular height. The span of the roof is also important. Often it
     is seen that gymnasiums, supermarkets, and churches suffer damage when individual homes suffer far less damage.
     The roofs with large surface areas supported only at the edges resonate at the frequencies of the earthquakes,
     causing them to collapse. As the earthquake waves travel along the surface of Earth and reflect off denser rocks,
     constructive interference occurs at certain points. Often areas closer to the epicenter are not damaged, while areas
     farther away are damaged.

FIGURE 17.1 Hearing is an important human sense that can detect frequencies of sound, ranging between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. However,
other species have very different ranges of hearing. Bats, for example, emit clicks in ultrasound, using frequencies beyond 20 kHz. They
can detect nearby insects by hearing the echo of these ultrasonic clicks. Ultrasound is important in several human applications, including
probing the interior structures of human bodies, Earth, and the Sun. Ultrasound is also useful in industry for nondestructive testing.

INTRODUCTION Sound is an example of a mechanical wave, specifically, a pressure wave: Sound waves travel
through the air and other media as oscillations of molecules. Normal human hearing encompasses an impressive
range of frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Sounds below 20 Hz are called infrasound, whereas those above 20 kHz
are called ultrasound. Some animals, like the bat shown in Figure 17.1, can hear sounds in the ultrasonic range.
Many of the concepts covered in Waves also have applications in the study of sound. For example, when a sound
806  17 · Sound

     wave encounters an interface between two media with different wave speeds, reflection and transmission of the
     wave occur.

     Ultrasound has many uses in science, engineering, and medicine. Ultrasound is used for nondestructive testing in
     engineering, such as testing the thickness of coating on metal. In medicine, sound waves are far less destructive
     than X-rays and can be used to image the fetus in a mother's womb without danger to the fetus or the mother. Later
     in this chapter, we discuss the Doppler effect, which can be used to determine the velocity of blood in the arteries or
     wind speed in weather systems.

     17.1 Sound Waves

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the difference between sound and hearing
         · Describe sound as a wave
         · List the equations used to model sound waves
         · Describe compression and rarefactions as they relate to sound

     The physical phenomenon of sound is a disturbance of matter that is transmitted from its source outward. Hearing
     is the perception of sound, just as seeing is the perception of visible light. On the atomic scale, sound is a
     disturbance of atoms that is far more ordered than their thermal motions. In many instances, sound is a periodic
     wave, and the atoms undergo simple harmonic motion. Thus, sound waves can induce oscillations and resonance
     effects (Figure 17.2).

     This video (https://openstax.org/l/21waveswineglas) shows waves on the surface of a wine glass, being driven by
     sound waves from a speaker. As the frequency of the sound wave approaches the resonant frequency of the wine
     glass, the amplitude and frequency of the waves on the wine glass increase. When the resonant frequency is
     reached, the glass shatters.

A speaker produces a sound wave by oscillating a cone, causing vibrations of air molecules. In Figure 17.3, a
speaker vibrates at a constant frequency and amplitude, producing vibrations in the surrounding air molecules. As
the speaker oscillates back and forth, it transfers energy to the air, mostly as thermal energy. But a small part of the
speaker's energy goes into compressing and expanding the surrounding air, creating slightly higher and lower local
pressures. These compressions (high-pressure regions) and rarefactions (low-pressure regions) move out as
longitudinal pressure waves having the same frequency as the speaker--they are the disturbance that is a sound
wave. (Sound waves in air and most fluids are longitudinal, because fluids have almost no shear strength. In solids,
sound waves can be both transverse and longitudinal.)

Figure 17.3(a) shows the compressions and rarefactions, and also shows a graph of gauge pressure versus distance
from a speaker. As the speaker moves in the positive x-direction, it pushes air molecules, displacing them from their
equilibrium positions. As the speaker moves in the negative x-direction, the air molecules move back toward their
equilibrium positions due to a restoring force. The air molecules oscillate in simple harmonic motion about their
equilibrium positions, as shown in part (b). Note that sound waves in air are longitudinal, and in the figure, the wave
propagates in the positive x-direction and the molecules oscillate parallel to the direction in which the wave
propagates.

FIGURE 17.3 (a) A vibrating cone of a speaker, moving in the positive x-direction, compresses the air in front of it and expands the air
behind it. As the speaker oscillates, it creates another compression and rarefaction as those on the right move away from the speaker. After
many vibrations, a series of compressions and rarefactions moves out from the speaker as a sound wave. The red graph shows the gauge
pressure of the air versus the distance from the speaker. Pressures vary only slightly from atmospheric pressure for ordinary sounds. Note
that gauge pressure is modeled with a sine function, where the crests of the function line up with the compressions and the troughs line up
with the rarefactions. (b) Sound waves can also be modeled using the displacement of the air molecules. The blue graph shows the
displacement of the air molecules versus the position from the speaker and is modeled with a cosine function. Notice that the displacement
is zero for the molecules in their equilibrium position and are centered at the compressions and rarefactions. Compressions are formed
when molecules on either side of the equilibrium molecules are displaced toward the equilibrium position. Rarefactions are formed when
the molecules are displaced away from the equilibrium position.

MODELS DESCRIBING SOUND

Sound can be modeled as a pressure wave by considering the change in pressure from average pressure,
                                                                                                                                                17.1

This equation is similar to the periodic wave equations seen in Waves, where  is the change in pressure,
                                                                                         is the angular
is the maximum change in pressure,  is the wave number,

frequency, and is the initial phase. The wave speed can be determined from    Sound waves can

also be modeled in terms of the displacement of the air molecules. The displacement of the air molecules can

be modeled using a cosine function:
                                                                                                                                                17.2
808  17 · Sound

     In this equation, s is the displacement and  is the maximum displacement.

     Not shown in the figure is the amplitude of a sound wave as it decreases with distance from its source, because the
     energy of the wave is spread over a larger and larger area. The intensity decreases as it moves away from the
     speaker, as discussed in Waves. The energy is also absorbed by objects and converted into thermal energy by the
     viscosity of the air. In addition, during each compression, a little heat transfers to the air; during each rarefaction,
     even less heat transfers from the air, and these heat transfers reduce the organized disturbance into random
     thermal motions. Whether the heat transfer from compression to rarefaction is significant depends on how far apart
     they are--that is, it depends on wavelength. Wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and speed of propagation are
     important characteristics for sound, as they are for all waves.

     17.2 Speed of Sound

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the relationship between wavelength and frequency of sound
         · Determine the speed of sound in different media
         · Derive the equation for the speed of sound in air
         · Determine the speed of sound in air for a given temperature

     Sound, like all waves, travels at a certain speed and has the properties of frequency and wavelength. You can
     observe direct evidence of the speed of sound while watching a fireworks display (Figure 17.4). You see the flash of
     an explosion well before you hear its sound and possibly feel the pressure wave, implying both that sound travels at
     a finite speed and that it is much slower than light.

     FIGURE 17.4 When a firework shell explodes, we perceive the light energy before the sound energy because sound travels more slowly
     than light does.

     The difference between the speed of light and the speed of sound can also be experienced during an electrical
     storm. The flash of lighting is often seen before the clap of thunder. You may have heard that if you count the
     number of seconds between the flash and the sound, you can estimate the distance to the source. Every five
     seconds converts to about one mile. The velocity of any wave is related to its frequency and wavelength by

                                                                                                                                                          17.3

where v is the speed of the wave, f is its frequency, and is its wavelength. Recall from Waves that the wavelength is
the length of the wave as measured between sequential identical points. For example, for a surface water wave or
sinusoidal wave on a string, the wavelength can be measured between any two convenient sequential points with
the same height and slope, such as between two sequential crests or two sequential troughs. Similarly, the
wavelength of a sound wave is the distance between sequential identical parts of a wave--for example, between
sequential compressions (Figure 17.5). The frequency is the same as that of the source and is the number of waves
that pass a point per unit time.

wavelength .

Speed of Sound in Various Media

Table 17.1 shows that the speed of sound varies greatly in different media. The speed of sound in a medium
depends on how quickly vibrational energy can be transferred through the medium. For this reason, the derivation of
the speed of sound in a medium depends on the medium and on the state of the medium. In general, the equation
for the speed of a mechanical wave in a medium depends on the square root of the restoring force, or the elastic
property, divided by the inertial property,

Also, sound waves satisfy the wave equation derived in Waves,

Recall from Waves that the speed of a wave on a string is equal to  where the restoring force is the

tension in the string and the linear density is the inertial property. In a fluid, the speed of sound depends on
the bulk modulus and the density,

                                                                                                      17.4

The speed of sound in a solid depends on the Young's modulus of the medium and the density,

                                                                                                      17.5
810  17 · Sound

     In an ideal gas (see The Kinetic Theory of Gases (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-2/pages/
     2-introduction)), the equation for the speed of sound is

                                                                                                                                                          17.6

     where is the adiabatic index,            is the gas constant, is the absolute temperature in kelvins,

     and M is the molar mass. In general, the more rigid (or less compressible) the medium, the faster the speed of

     sound. This observation is analogous to the fact that the frequency of simple harmonic motion is directly

     proportional to the stiffness of the oscillating object as measured by k, the spring constant. The greater the density

     of a medium, the slower the speed of sound. This observation is analogous to the fact that the frequency of a simple

     harmonic motion is inversely proportional to m, the mass of the oscillating object. The speed of sound in air is low,

     because air is easily compressible. Because liquids and solids are relatively rigid and very difficult to compress, the

     speed of sound in such media is generally greater than in gases.

                Various Media

Because the speed of sound depends on the density of the material, and the density depends on the temperature,
there is a relationship between the temperature in a given medium and the speed of sound in the medium. For air at
sea level, the speed of sound is given by

                                                                                                                    17.7

where the temperature in the first equation (denoted as ) is in degrees Celsius and the temperature in the second
equation (denoted as ) is in kelvins. The speed of sound in gases is related to the average speed of particles in

the gas,        where is the Boltzmann constant                                    and m is the mass of each

(identical) particle in the gas. Note that v refers to the speed of the coherent propagation of a disturbance (the

wave), whereas  describes the speeds of particles in random directions. Thus, it is reasonable that the speed of

sound in air and other gases should depend on the square root of temperature. While not negligible, this is not a

strong dependence. At , the speed of sound is 331 m/s, whereas at  , it is 343 m/s, less than a

increase. Figure 17.6 shows how a bat uses the speed of sound to sense distances.

FIGURE 17.6 A bat uses sound echoes to find its way about and to catch prey. The time for the echo to return is directly proportional to the
distance.

Derivation of the Speed of Sound in Air

As stated earlier, the speed of sound in a medium depends on the medium and the state of the medium. The
derivation of the equation for the speed of sound in air starts with the mass flow rate and continuity equation
discussed in Fluid Mechanics.
812  17 · Sound

     Consider fluid flow through a pipe with cross-sectional area A (Figure 17.7). The mass in a small volume of length x

     of the pipe is equal to the density times the volume, or                               The mass flow rate is

     The continuity equation from Fluid Mechanics states that the mass flow rate into a volume has to equal the mass
     flow rate out of the volume,

     FIGURE 17.7 The mass of a fluid in a volume is equal to the density times the volume,  The mass flow rate is the time
     derivative of the mass.

     Now consider a sound wave moving through a parcel of air. A parcel of air is a small volume of air with imaginary
     boundaries (Figure 17.8). The density, temperature, and velocity on one side of the volume of the fluid are given as

               and on the other side are

     FIGURE 17.8 A sound wave moves through a volume of fluid. The density, temperature, and velocity of the fluid change from one side to the
     other.

     The continuity equation states that the mass flow rate entering the volume is equal to the mass flow rate leaving the
     volume, so

     This equation can be simplified, noting that the area cancels and considering that the multiplication of two
     infinitesimals is approximately equal to zero:

     The net force on the volume of fluid (Figure 17.9) equals the sum of the forces on the left face and the right face:

       FIGURE 17.9 A sound wave moves through a volume of fluid. The force on each face can be found by the pressure times the area.

The acceleration is the force divided by the mass and the mass is equal to the density times the volume,
                                We have

From the continuity equation           , we obtain

Consider a sound wave moving through air. During the process of compression and expansion of the gas, no heat is

added or removed from the system. A process where heat is not added or removed from the system is known as an

adiabatic system. Adiabatic processes are covered in detail in The First Law of Thermodynamics

(http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-2/pages/3-introduction), but for now it is sufficient to say

that for an adiabatic process,         where p is the pressure, V is the volume, and gamma is a constant

that depends on the gas. For air,      . The density equals the number of moles times the molar mass divided by

the volume, so the volume is equal to  The number of moles and the molar mass are constant and can be

absorbed into the constant             Taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields

Differentiating with respect to the density, the equation becomes

If the air can be considered an ideal gas, we can use the ideal gas law:

Here M is the molar mass of air:

Since the speed of sound is equal to   , the speed is equal to

     Note that the velocity is faster at higher temperatures and slower for heavier gases. For air,

                 and  If the temperature is         the speed of sound is

     The equation for the speed of sound in air     can be simplified to give the equation for the speed of sound
     in air as a function of absolute temperature:

     One of the more important properties of sound is that its speed is nearly independent of the frequency. This
     independence is certainly true in open air for sounds in the audible range. If this independence were not true, you
     would certainly notice it for music played by a marching band in a football stadium, for example. Suppose that high-
     frequency sounds traveled faster--then the farther you were from the band, the more the sound from the low-pitch
     instruments would lag that from the high-pitch ones. But the music from all instruments arrives in cadence
     independent of distance, so all frequencies must travel at nearly the same speed. Recall that

     In a given medium under fixed conditions, v is constant, so there is a relationship between f and  the higher the
     frequency, the smaller the wavelength (Figure 17.10).

     FIGURE 17.10 Because they travel at the same speed in a given medium, low-frequency sounds must have a greater wavelength than high-
     frequency sounds. Here, the lower-frequency sounds are emitted by the large speaker, called a woofer, whereas the higher-frequency
     sounds are emitted by the small speaker, called a tweeter. (credit: modification of work by Jane Whitney)

5. Enter the speed and the maximum frequency to give the minimum wavelength:

Significance
Because the product of f multiplied by equals a constant, the smaller f is, the larger must be, and vice versa.

The speed of sound can change when sound travels from one medium to another, but the frequency usually remains

the same. This is similar to the frequency of a wave on a string being equal to the frequency of the force oscillating

the string. If v changes and f remains the same, then the wavelength must change. That is, because  , the

higher the speed of a sound, the greater its wavelength for a given frequency.

Imagine you observe two firework shells explode. You hear the explosion of one as soon as you see it. However, you
see the other shell for several milliseconds before you hear the explosion. Explain why this is so.

Although sound waves in a fluid are longitudinal, sound waves in a solid travel both as longitudinal waves and
transverse waves. Seismic waves, which are essentially sound waves in Earth's crust produced by earthquakes, are
an interesting example of how the speed of sound depends on the rigidity of the medium. Earthquakes produce both
longitudinal and transverse waves, and these travel at different speeds. The bulk modulus of granite is greater than
its shear modulus. For that reason, the speed of longitudinal or pressure waves (P-waves) in earthquakes in granite
is significantly higher than the speed of transverse or shear waves (S-waves). Both types of earthquake waves travel
slower in less rigid material, such as sediments. P-waves have speeds of 4 to 7 km/s, and S-waves range in speed
from 2 to 5 km/s, both being faster in more rigid material. The P-wave gets progressively farther ahead of the S-
wave as they travel through Earth's crust. The time between the P- and S-waves is routinely used to determine the
distance to their source, the epicenter of the earthquake. Because S-waves do not pass through the liquid core, two
shadow regions are produced (Figure 17.11).
816  17 · Sound

     FIGURE 17.11 Earthquakes produce both longitudinal waves (P-waves) and transverse waves (S-waves), and these travel at different
     speeds. Both waves travel at different speeds in the different regions of Earth, but in general, P-waves travel faster than S-waves. S-waves
     cannot be supported by the liquid core, producing shadow regions.

     Seismologists and geophysicists use properties and velocities of earthquake waves to study the Earth's interior,
     which due to it's depth and pressure is not observable through many other means. In fact, the discoveries of the
     structure of the Earth, illustrated in the figure above, resulted from earthquake observations. In 1914, Beno
     Gutenberg used differences in wave speeds to determine that there must be a liquid core within the mantle. In
     1936, Inge Lehmann began investigating P-waves from a New Zealand earthquake that had unexpectedly reached
     Europe, which should have been in the shadow region. Up until that point, seismologists had explained such shadow
     waves as being caused by some type of diffraction (as Gutenberg himself assumed) or a result of faulty
     seismometers. However, Lehmann had installed the European instruments herself, and so trusted their accuracy.
     She calculated that the amplitude of the waves must be caused by the existence of a solid inner core within the
     liquid core. This model has been accepted and reinforced by decades of subsequent calculations, including those
     from nuclear test explosions, which can be measured very precisely.
     As sound waves move away from a speaker, or away from the epicenter of an earthquake, their power per unit area
     decreases. This is why the sound is very loud near a speaker and becomes less loud as you move away from the
     speaker. This also explains why there can be an extreme amount of damage at the epicenter of an earthquake but
     only tremors are felt in areas far from the epicenter. The power per unit area is known as the intensity, and in the
     next section, we will discuss how the intensity depends on the distance from the source.

     In a quiet forest, you can sometimes hear a single leaf fall to the ground. But when a passing motorist has their
     stereo turned up, you cannot even hear what the person next to you in your car is saying (Figure 17.12). We are all
     very familiar with the loudness of sounds and are aware that loudness is related to how energetically the source is
     vibrating. High noise exposure is hazardous to hearing, which is why it is important for people working in industrial
     settings to wear ear protection. The relevant physical quantity is sound intensity, a concept that is valid for all
     sounds whether or not they are in the audible range.

In Waves, we defined intensity as the power per unit area carried by a wave. Power is the rate at which energy is
transferred by the wave. In equation form, intensity I is

                                                                                                                                                     17.8

where P is the power through an area A. The SI unit for I is  If we assume that the sound wave is spherical,

and that no energy is lost to thermal processes, the energy of the sound wave is spread over a larger area as

distance increases, so the intensity decreases. The area of a sphere is  As the wave spreads out from

to the energy also spreads out over a larger area:

                                                                                                                                                     17.9

The intensity decreases as the wave moves out from the source. In an inverse square relationship, such as the
intensity, when you double the distance, the intensity decreases to one quarter,

Generally, when considering the intensity of a sound wave, we take the intensity to be the time-averaged value of

the power, denoted by  divided by the area,

                                                                                                               17.10

The intensity of a sound wave is proportional to the change in the pressure squared and inversely proportional to the
density and the speed. Consider a parcel of a medium initially undisturbed and then influenced by a sound wave at
time t, as shown in Figure 17.13.
818  17 · Sound

     FIGURE 17.13 An undisturbed parcel of a medium with a volume      shown in blue. A sound wave moves through the medium at

     time t, and the parcel is displaced and expands, as shown by dotted lines. The change in volume is                             , where is

     the displacement of the leading edge of the parcel and is the displacement of the trailing edge of the parcel. In the figure,  and

     the parcel expands, but the parcel can either expand or compress  , depending on which part of the sound wave (compression or

     rarefaction) is moving through the parcel.

     As the sound wave moves through the parcel, the parcel is displaced and may expand or contract. If                             , the

     volume has increased and the pressure decreases. If               the volume has decreased and the pressure

     increases. The change in the volume is

     The fractional change in the volume is the change in volume divided by the original volume:

     The fractional change in volume is related to the pressure fluctuation by the bulk modulus                                     Recall that

     the minus sign is required because the volume is inversely related to the pressure. (We use lowercase p for pressure

     to distinguish it from power, denoted by P.) The change in pressure is therefore                                               If

     the sound wave is sinusoidal, then the displacement as shown in Equation 17.2 is
     and the pressure is found to be

     The intensity of the sound wave is the power per unit area, and the power is the force times the velocity,
                                 Here, the velocity is the velocity of the oscillations of the medium, and not the velocity of the

     sound wave. The velocity of the medium is the time rate of change in the displacement:

     Thus, the intensity becomes

     To find the time-averaged intensity over one period               for a position x, we integrate over the period,

                 Using                           and

some vibration; the greater its pressure amplitude, the more the air is compressed in the sound it creates.

Human Hearing and Sound Intensity Levels

As stated earlier in this chapter, hearing is the perception of sound. The hearing mechanism involves some
interesting physics. The sound wave that impinges upon our ear is a pressure wave. The ear is a transducer that
converts sound waves into electrical nerve impulses in a manner much more sophisticated than, but analogous to, a
microphone. Figure 17.14 shows the anatomy of the ear.

                                                               FIGURE 17.14 The anatomy of the human ear.

The outer ear, or ear canal, carries sound to the recessed, protected eardrum. The air column in the ear canal
resonates and is partially responsible for the sensitivity of the ear to sounds in the 2000-5000-Hz range. The
middle ear converts sound into mechanical vibrations and applies these vibrations to the cochlea.

The range of intensities that the human ear can hear depends on the frequency of the sound, but, in general, the

range is quite large. The minimum threshold intensity that can be heard is                     Pain is experienced at

intensities of               Measurements of sound intensity (in units of   ) are very cumbersome due to

this large range in values. For this reason, as well as for other reasons, the concept of sound intensity level was

proposed.

The sound intensity level of a sound, measured in decibels, having an intensity I in watts per meter squared, is
defined as

                                                                                                                                     17.12

     where                   is a reference intensity, corresponding to the threshold intensity of sound that a person

     with normal hearing can perceive at a frequency of 1.00 kHz. It is more common to consider sound intensity levels

     in dB than in       How human ears perceive sound can be more accurately described by the logarithm of the

     intensity rather than directly by the intensity. Because is defined in terms of a ratio, it is a unitless quantity, telling

     you the level of the sound relative to a fixed standard (              ). The units of decibels (dB) are used to indicate

     this ratio is multiplied by 10 in its definition. The bel, upon which the decibel is based, is named for Alexander

     Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone.

     The decibel level of a sound having the threshold intensity of               is             because                             Table

     sensitive to as little as a trillionth of a watt per meter squared--even more impressive when you realize that the area

     of the eardrum is only about     so that only              falls on it at the threshold of hearing. Air molecules in a

     sound wave of this intensity vibrate over a distance of less than one molecular diameter, and the gauge pressures

An observation readily verified by examining Table 17.2 or by using Equation 17.12 is that each factor of 10 in
intensity corresponds to 10 dB. For example, a 90-dB sound compared with a 60-dB sound is 30 dB greater, or
three factors of 10 (that is, times) as intense. Another example is that if one sound is as intense as another,

     Significance
     This 87-dB sound has an intensity five times as great as an 80-dB sound. So a factor of five in intensity corresponds
     to a difference of 7 dB in sound intensity level. This value is true for any intensities differing by a factor of five.

     Significance

     This means that the two sound intensity levels differ by 3.01 dB, or about 3 dB, as advertised. Note that because

     only the ratio  is given (and not the actual intensities), this result is true for any intensities that differ by a

     factor of two. For example, a 56.0-dB sound is twice as intense as a 53.0-dB sound, a 97.0-dB sound is half as

     intense as a 100-dB sound, and so on.

     Another decibel scale is also in use, called the sound pressure level, based on the ratio of the pressure amplitude
     to a reference pressure. This scale is used particularly in applications where sound travels in water. It is beyond the
     scope of this text to treat this scale because it is not commonly used for sounds in air, but it is important to note that
     very different decibel levels may be encountered when sound pressure levels are quoted.

     Hearing and Pitch

     The human ear has a tremendous range and sensitivity. It can give us a wealth of simple information--such as pitch,
     loudness, and direction.

17.3 · Sound Intensity                                                                                                                      823

The perception of frequency is called pitch. Typically, humans have excellent relative pitch and can discriminate
between two sounds if their frequencies differ by 0.3% or more. For example, 500.0 and 501.5 Hz are noticeably
different. Musical notes are sounds of a particular frequency that can be produced by most instruments and in
Western music have particular names, such as A-sharp, C, or E-flat.

The perception of intensity is called loudness. At a given frequency, it is possible to discern differences of about 1
dB, and a change of 3 dB is easily noticed. But loudness is not related to intensity alone. Frequency has a major
effect on how loud a sound seems. Sounds near the high- and low-frequency extremes of the hearing range seem
even less loud, because the ear is less sensitive at those frequencies. When a violin plays middle C, there is no
mistaking it for a piano playing the same note. The reason is that each instrument produces a distinctive set of
frequencies and intensities. We call our perception of these combinations of frequencies and intensities tone quality
or, more commonly, the timbre of the sound. Timbre is the shape of the wave that arises from the many reflections,
resonances, and superposition in an instrument.

A unit called a phon is used to express loudness numerically. Phons differ from decibels because the phon is a unit
of loudness perception, whereas the decibel is a unit of physical intensity. Figure 17.15 shows the relationship of
loudness to intensity (or intensity level) and frequency for persons with normal hearing. The curved lines are equal-
loudness curves. Each curve is labeled with its loudness in phons. Any sound along a given curve is perceived as
equally loud by the average person. The curves were determined by having large numbers of people compare the
loudness of sounds at different frequencies and sound intensity levels. At a frequency of 1000 Hz, phons are taken
to be numerically equal to decibels.

FIGURE 17.15 The relationship of loudness in phons to intensity level (in decibels) and intensity (in watts per meter squared) for persons
with normal hearing. The curved lines are equal-loudness curves--all sounds on a given curve are perceived as equally loud. Phons and
decibels are defined to be the same at 1000 Hz.

        EXAMPLE 17.4

Measuring Loudness

(a) What is the loudness in phons of a 100-Hz sound that has an intensity level of 80 dB? (b) What is the intensity
level in decibels of a 4000-Hz sound having a loudness of 70 phons? (c) At what intensity level will an 8000-Hz
sound have the same loudness as a 200-Hz sound at 60 dB?

Strategy
The graph in Figure 17.15 should be referenced to solve this example. To find the loudness of a given sound, you
824  17 · Sound

     must know its frequency and intensity level, locate that point on the square grid, and then interpolate between
     loudness curves to get the loudness in phons. Once that point is located, the intensity level can be determined from
     the vertical axis.

     Solution

       1. Identify knowns: The square grid of the graph relating phons and decibels is a plot of intensity level versus
             frequency--both physical quantities: 100 Hz at 80 dB lies halfway between the curves marked 70 and 80
             phons.
             Find the loudness: 75 phons.

       2. Identify knowns: Values are given to be 4000 Hz at 70 phons.
             Follow the 70-phon curve until it reaches 4000 Hz. At that point, it is below the 70 dB line at about 67 dB.
             Find the intensity level: 67 dB.

       3. Locate the point for a 200 Hz and 60 dB sound.
             Find the loudness: This point lies just slightly above the 50-phon curve, and so its loudness is 51 phons.
             Look for the 51-phon level is at 8000 Hz: 63 dB.

     Significance
     These answers, like all information extracted from Figure 17.15, have uncertainties of several phons or several
     decibels, partly due to difficulties in interpolation, but mostly related to uncertainties in the equal-loudness curves.

     In this section, we discussed the characteristics of sound and how we hear, but how are the sounds we hear
     produced? Interesting sources of sound are musical instruments and the human voice, and we will discuss these
     sources. But before we can understand how musical instruments produce sound, we need to look at the basic
     mechanisms behind these instruments. The theories behind the mechanisms used by musical instruments involve
     interference, superposition, and standing waves, which we discuss in the next section.

     Interference is the hallmark of waves, all of which exhibit constructive and destructive interference exactly
     analogous to that seen for water waves. In fact, one way to prove something "is a wave" is to observe interference
     effects. Since sound is a wave, we expect it to exhibit interference.

     Interference of Sound Waves

     In Waves, we discussed the interference of wave functions that differ only in a phase shift. We found that the wave

     function resulting from the superposition of                   and              is

     One way for two identical waves that are initially in phase to become out of phase with one another is to have the
     waves travel different distances; that is, they have different path lengths. Sound waves provide an excellent
     example of a phase shift due to a path difference. As we have discussed, sound waves can basically be modeled as
     longitudinal waves, where the molecules of the medium oscillate around an equilibrium position, or as pressure
     waves.

When the waves leave the speakers, they move out as spherical waves (Figure 17.16). The waves interfere;
constructive inference is produced by the combination of two crests or two troughs, as shown. Destructive
interference is produced by the combination of a trough and a crest.

FIGURE 17.16 When sound waves are produced by a speaker, they travel at the speed of sound and move out as spherical waves. Here, two
speakers produce the same steady tone (frequency). The result is points of high-intensity sound (highlighted), which result from two crests
(compression) or two troughs (rarefaction) overlapping. Destructive interference results from a crest and trough overlapping. The points
where there is constructive interference in the figure occur because the two waves are in phase at those points. Points of destructive
interference (Figure 17.17) are the result of the two waves being out of phase.

     FIGURE 17.17 Two speakers being driven by a single signal generator. The sound waves produced by the speakers are in phase and are of a
     single frequency. The sound waves interfere with each other. When two crests or two troughs coincide, there is constructive interference,
     marked by the red and blue dots. When a trough and a crest coincide, destructive interference occurs, marked by black dots. The phase
     difference is due to the path lengths traveled by the individual waves. Two identical waves travel two different path lengths to a point P. (a)
     The difference in the path lengths is one wavelength, resulting in total constructive interference and a resulting amplitude equal to twice
     the original amplitude. (b) The difference in the path lengths is less than one wavelength but greater than one half a wavelength, resulting in
     an amplitude greater than zero and less than twice the original amplitude. (c) The difference in the path lengths is one half of a wavelength,
     resulting in total destructive interference and a resulting amplitude of zero.

     The phase difference at each point is due to the different path lengths traveled by each wave. When the difference in
     the path lengths is an integer multiple of a wavelength,

     the waves are in phase and there is constructive interference. When the difference in path lengths is an odd multiple

     If you walk around two speakers playing music, how come you do not notice places where the music is very loud or
     very soft, that is, where there is constructive and destructive interference?

     The concept of a phase shift due to a difference in path length is very important. You will use this concept again in
     Interference (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/3-introduction) and Photons and
     Matter Waves (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/6-introduction), where we discuss
     how Thomas Young used this method in his famous double-slit experiment to provide evidence that light has
     wavelike properties.

     Noise Reduction through Destructive Interference

     Figure 17.18 shows a clever use of sound interference to cancel noise. Larger-scale applications of active noise
     reduction by destructive interference have been proposed for entire passenger compartments in commercial
     aircraft. To obtain destructive interference, a fast electronic analysis is performed, and a second sound is introduced

            out of phase with the original sound, with its maxima and minima exactly reversed from the incoming noise.
     Sound waves in fluids are pressure waves and are consistent with Pascal's principle; that is, pressures from two
     different sources add and subtract like simple numbers. Therefore, positive and negative gauge pressures add to a
     much smaller pressure, producing a lower-intensity sound. Although completely destructive interference is possible
     only under the simplest conditions, it is possible to reduce noise levels by 30 dB or more using this technique.

     FIGURE 17.18 Headphones designed to cancel noise with destructive interference create a sound wave exactly opposite to the incoming
     sound. These headphones can be more effective than the simple passive attenuation used in most ear protection. Such headphones were
     used on the record-setting, around-the-world nonstop flight of the Voyager aircraft in 1986 to protect the pilots' hearing from engine noise.

     Describe how noise-canceling headphones differ from standard headphones used to block outside sounds.

     Where else can we observe sound interference? All sound resonances, such as in musical instruments, are due to
     constructive and destructive interference. Only the resonant frequencies interfere constructively to form standing
     waves, whereas others interfere destructively and are absent.

     Resonance in a Tube Closed at one End

     As we discussed in Waves, standing waves are formed by two waves moving in opposite directions. When two
     identical sinusoidal waves move in opposite directions, the waves may be modeled as

     Access for free at openstax.org
17.4 · Normal Modes of a Standing Sound Wave                                                                                               829

When these two waves interfere, the resultant wave is a standing wave:

Resonance can be produced due to the boundary conditions imposed on a wave. In Waves, we showed that
resonance could be produced in a string under tension that had symmetrical boundary conditions, specifically, a
node at each end. We defined a node as a fixed point where the string did not move. We found that the symmetrical
boundary conditions resulted in some frequencies resonating and producing standing waves, also called normal
modes, while other frequencies interfere destructively. Sound waves can resonate in a hollow tube, and the
frequencies of the sound waves that resonate depend on the boundary conditions.

Suppose we have a tube that is closed at one end and open at the other. If we hold a vibrating tuning fork near the
open end of the tube, an incident sound wave travels through the tube and reflects off the closed end. The reflected
sound has the same frequency and wavelength as the incident sound wave, but is traveling in the opposite direction.
At the closed end of the tube, the molecules of air have very little freedom to oscillate, and a node arises. At the
open end, the molecules are free to move, and at the right frequency, an antinode occurs. Unlike the symmetrical
boundary conditions for the standing waves on the string, the boundary conditions for a tube open at one end and
closed at the other end are anti-symmetrical: a node at the closed end and an antinode at the open end.

If the tuning fork has just the right frequency, the air column in the tube resonates loudly, but at most frequencies it
vibrates very little. This observation just means that the air column has only certain natural frequencies. Consider
the lowest frequency that will cause the tube to resonate, producing a loud sound. There will be a node at the closed
end and an antinode at the open end, as shown in Figure 17.19.

FIGURE 17.19 Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork that vibrates at the lowest frequency that can produce
resonance (the fundamental frequency). A node exists at the closed end and an antinode at the open end.

The standing wave formed in the tube has an antinode at the open end and a node at the closed end. The distance
from a node to an antinode is one-fourth of a wavelength, and this equals the length of the tube; thus,
This same resonance can be produced by a vibration introduced at or near the closed end of the tube (Figure 17.20).
It is best to consider this a natural vibration of the air column, independently of how it is induced.

                      FIGURE 17.20 The same standing wave is created in the tube by a vibration introduced near its closed end.

Given that maximum air displacements are possible at the open end and none at the closed end, other shorter
830  17 · Sound

     wavelengths can resonate in the tube, such as the one shown in Figure 17.21. Here the standing wave has three-

     fourths of its wavelength in the tube, or   so that                      Continuing this process reveals a whole series

     of shorter-wavelength and higher-frequency sounds that resonate in the tube. We use specific terms for the
     resonances in any system. The lowest resonant frequency is called the fundamental, while all higher resonant
     frequencies are called overtones. The resonant frequencies that are integral multiples of the fundamental are
     collectively called harmonics. The fundamental is the first harmonic, the second harmonic is twice the frequency of
     the first harmonic, and so on. Some of these harmonics may not exist for a given scenario. Figure 17.22 shows the
     fundamental and the first three overtones (or the first, third, fifth, and seventh harmonics) in a tube closed at one
     end.

     FIGURE 17.21 Another resonance for a tube closed at one end. This standing wave has maximum air displacement at the open end and

     none at the closed end. The wavelength is shorter, with three-fourths equaling the length of the tube, so that  . This higher-

     frequency vibration is the first overtone.

     FIGURE 17.22 The fundamental and three lowest overtones for a tube closed at one end. All have maximum air displacements at the open
     end and none at the closed end.

     The relationship for the resonant wavelengths of a tube closed at one end is

                                                                                                                                                        17.13

     Now let us look for a pattern in the resonant frequencies for a simple tube that is closed at one end. The

     fundamental has  and frequency is related to wavelength and the speed of sound as given by

     Solving for f in this equation gives

     where v is the speed of sound in air. Similarly, the first overtone has  (see Figure 17.22), so that

     Because          we call the first overtone the third harmonic. Continuing this process, we see a pattern that can

     be generalized in a single expression. The resonant frequencies of a tube closed at one end are

                                                                                                                     17.14

     depend on the speed of sound and, hence, on temperature. This dependence poses a noticeable problem for organs

temperature before playing them.

Resonance in a Tube Open at Both Ends

Another source of standing waves is a tube that is open at both ends. In this case, the boundary conditions are
symmetrical: an antinode at each end. The resonances of tubes open at both ends can be analyzed in a very similar
fashion to those for tubes closed at one end. The air columns in tubes open at both ends have maximum air
displacements at both ends (Figure 17.23). Standing waves form as shown.

FIGURE 17.23 The resonant frequencies of a tube open at both ends, including the fundamental and the first three overtones. In all cases,
the maximum air displacements occur at both ends of the tube, giving it different natural frequencies than a tube closed at one end.

The relationship for the resonant wavelengths of a tube open at both ends is

                                                                                                                                                   17.15

Based on the fact that a tube open at both ends has maximum air displacements at both ends, and using Figure
17.23 as a guide, we can see that the resonant frequencies of a tube open at both ends are

                                                                                                                                                   17.16

where is the fundamental, is the first overtone, is the second overtone, and so on. Note that a tube open at
both ends has a fundamental frequency twice what it would have if closed at one end. It also has a different
spectrum of overtones than a tube closed at one end.

Note that a tube open at both ends has symmetrical boundary conditions, similar to the string fixed at both ends
discussed in Waves. The relationships for the wavelengths and frequencies of a stringed instrument are the same as

given in Equation 17.15 and Equation 17.16. The speed of the wave on the string (from Waves) is              The air

around the string vibrates at the same frequency as the string, producing sound of the same frequency. The sound

                                   FIGURE 17.25 Some musical instruments can be modeled as a pipe closed at one end.

Resonant frequencies are produced by longitudinal waves that travel down the tubes and interfere with the
reflected waves traveling in the opposite direction. A pipe organ is manufactured with various tubes of fixed lengths
to produce different frequencies. The waves are the result of compressed air allowed to expand in the tubes. Even in
open tubes, some reflection occurs due to the constraints of the sides of the tubes and the atmospheric pressure
outside the open tube.

The antinodes do not occur at the opening of the tube, but rather depend on the radius of the tube. The waves do
not fully expand until they are outside the open end of a tube, and for a thin-walled tube, an end correction should
be added. This end correction is approximately 0.6 times the radius of the tube and should be added to the length of
the tube.

Players of instruments such as the flute or oboe vary the length of the tube by opening and closing finger holes. On a
trombone, you change the tube length by using a sliding tube. Bugles have a fixed length and can produce only a
limited range of frequencies.

The fundamental and overtones can be present simultaneously in a variety of combinations. For example, middle C
on a trumpet sounds distinctively different from middle C on a clarinet, although both instruments are modified
versions of a tube closed at one end. The fundamental frequency is the same (and usually the most intense), but the
overtones and their mix of intensities are different and subject to shading by the musician. This mix is what gives
various musical instruments (and human voices) their distinctive characteristics, whether they have air columns,
strings, sounding boxes, or drumheads. In fact, much of our speech is determined by shaping the cavity formed by
the throat and mouth, and positioning the tongue to adjust the fundamental and combination of overtones. For
example, simple resonant cavities can be made to resonate with the sound of the vowels (Figure 17.26). In boys at
puberty, the larynx grows and the shape of the resonant cavity changes, giving rise to the difference in predominant
frequencies in speech between men and women.

     spectrum of overtones and their intensities vary with mouth shaping and tongue position to form different sounds. The voice box can be
     replaced with a mechanical vibrator, and understandable speech is still possible. Variations in basic shapes make different voices
     recognizable.

Significance
Many wind instruments are modified tubes that have finger holes, valves, and other devices for changing the length
of the resonating air column and hence, the frequency of the note played. Horns producing very low frequencies
require tubes so long that they are coiled into loops. An example is the tuba. Whether an overtone occurs in a simple
tube or a musical instrument depends on how it is stimulated to vibrate and the details of its shape. The trombone,
for example, does not produce its fundamental frequency and only makes overtones.

If you have two tubes with the same fundamental frequency, but one is open at both ends and the other is closed at
one end, they would sound different when played because they have different overtones. Middle C, for example,
would sound richer played on an open tube, because it has even multiples of the fundamental as well as odd. A
closed tube has only odd multiples.

Resonance

Resonance occurs in many different systems, including strings, air columns, and atoms. As we discussed in earlier
chapters, resonance is the driven or forced oscillation of a system at its natural frequency. At resonance, energy is
transferred rapidly to the oscillating system, and the amplitude of its oscillations grows until the system can no
longer be described by Hooke's law. An example of this is the distorted sound intentionally produced in certain types
of rock music.

Wind instruments use resonance in air columns to amplify tones made by lips or vibrating reeds. Other instruments
also use air resonance in clever ways to amplify sound. Figure 17.27 shows a violin and a guitar, both of which have
sounding boxes but with different shapes, resulting in different overtone structures. The vibrating string creates a
sound that resonates in the sounding box, greatly amplifying the sound and creating overtones that give the
instrument its characteristic timbre. The more complex the shape of the sounding box, the greater its ability to
resonate over a wide range of frequencies. The marimba, like the one shown in Figure 17.28, uses pots or gourds
below the wooden slats to amplify their tones. The resonance of the pot can be adjusted by adding water.

     We have emphasized sound applications in our discussions of resonance and standing waves, but these ideas apply
     to any system that has wave characteristics. Vibrating strings, for example, are actually resonating and have
     fundamentals and overtones similar to those for air columns. More subtle are the resonances in atoms due to the
     wave character of their electrons. Their orbitals can be viewed as standing waves, which have a fundamental
     (ground state) and overtones (excited states). It is fascinating that wave characteristics apply to such a wide range
     of physical systems.

     17.6 Beats

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Determine the beat frequency produced by two sound waves that differ in frequency
         · Describe how beats are produced by musical instruments

     The study of music provides many examples of the superposition of waves and the constructive and destructive
     interference that occurs. Very few examples of music being performed consist of a single source playing a single
     frequency for an extended period of time. You will probably agree that a single frequency of sound for an extended
     period might be boring to the point of irritation, similar to the unwanted drone of an aircraft engine or a loud fan.
     Music is pleasant and interesting due to mixing the changing frequencies of various instruments and voices.

     An interesting phenomenon that occurs due to the constructive and destructive interference of two or more
     frequencies of sound is the phenomenon of beats. If two sounds differ in frequencies, the sound waves can be
     modeled as

     Using the trigonometric identity  and considering the point in space as

                    we find the resulting sound at a point in space, from the superposition of the two sound waves, is equal
     to Figure 17.29:

These beats can be used by piano tuners to tune a piano. A tuning fork is struck and a note is played on the piano. As
the piano tuner tunes the string, the beats have a lower frequency as the frequency of the note played approaches
the frequency of the tuning fork.

     What would happen if more than two frequencies interacted? Consider three frequencies.

     The study of the superposition of various waves has many interesting applications beyond the study of sound. In
     later chapters, we will discuss the wave properties of particles. The particles can be modeled as a "wave packet"
     that results from the superposition of various waves, where the particle moves at the "group velocity" of the wave
     packet.

     17.7 The Doppler Effect

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the change in observed frequency as a moving source of sound approaches or departs from a
             stationary observer

         · Explain the change in observed frequency as an observer moves toward or away from a stationary source
             of sound

     The characteristic sound of a motorcycle buzzing by is an example of the Doppler effect. Specifically, if you are
     standing on a street corner and observe an ambulance with a siren sounding passing at a constant speed, you notice
     two characteristic changes in the sound of the siren. First, the sound increases in loudness as the ambulance
     approaches and decreases in loudness as it moves away, which is expected. But in addition, the high-pitched siren
     shifts dramatically to a lower-pitched sound. As the ambulance passes, the frequency of the sound heard by a
     stationary observer changes from a constant high frequency to a constant lower frequency, even though the siren is
     producing a constant source frequency. The closer the ambulance brushes by, the more abrupt the shift. Also, the
     faster the ambulance moves, the greater the shift. We also hear this characteristic shift in frequency for passing
     cars, airplanes, and trains.

     The Doppler effect is an alteration in the observed frequency of a sound due to motion of either the source or the
     observer. Although less familiar, this effect is easily noticed for a stationary source and moving observer. For
     example, if you ride a train past a stationary warning horn, you will hear the horn's frequency shift from high to low
     as you pass by. The actual change in frequency due to relative motion of source and observer is called a Doppler
     shift. The Doppler effect and Doppler shift are named for the Austrian physicist and mathematician Christian Johann
     Doppler (1803-1853), who did experiments with both moving sources and moving observers. Doppler, for example,
     had musicians play on a moving open train car and also play standing next to the train tracks as a train passed by.
     Their music was observed both on and off the train, and changes in frequency were measured.

     What causes the Doppler shift? Figure 17.30 illustrates sound waves emitted by stationary and moving sources in a
     stationary air mass. Each disturbance spreads out spherically from the point at which the sound is emitted. If the
     source is stationary, then all of the spheres representing the air compressions in the sound wave are centered on the
     same point, and the stationary observers on either side hear the same wavelength and frequency as emitted by the
     source (case a). If the source is moving, the situation is different. Each compression of the air moves out in a sphere
     from the point at which it was emitted, but the point of emission moves. This moving emission point causes the air
     compressions to be closer together on one side and farther apart on the other. Thus, the wavelength is shorter in the
     direction the source is moving (on the right in case b), and longer in the opposite direction (on the left in case b).
     Finally, if the observers move, as in case (c), the frequency at which they receive the compressions changes. The
     observer moving toward the source receives them at a higher frequency, and the person moving away from the
     source receives them at a lower frequency.

FIGURE 17.30 Sounds emitted by a source spread out in spherical waves. (a) When the source, observers, and air are stationary, the
wavelength and frequency are the same in all directions and to all observers. (b) Sounds emitted by a source moving to the right spread out
from the points at which they were emitted. The wavelength is reduced, and consequently, the frequency is increased in the direction of
motion, so that the observer on the right hears a higher-pitched sound. The opposite is true for the observer on the left, where the
wavelength is increased and the frequency is reduced. (c) The same effect is produced when the observers move relative to the source.
Motion toward the source increases frequency as the observer on the right passes through more wave crests than she would if stationary.
Motion away from the source decreases frequency as the observer on the left passes through fewer wave crests than he would if stationary.

We know that wavelength and frequency are related by  where v is the fixed speed of sound. The sound

moves in a medium and has the same speed v in that medium whether the source is moving or not. Thus, f

multiplied by is a constant. Because the observer on the right in case (b) receives a shorter wavelength, the

frequency she receives must be higher. Similarly, the observer on the left receives a longer wavelength, and hence

he hears a lower frequency. The same thing happens in case (c). A higher frequency is received by the observer

moving toward the source, and a lower frequency is received by an observer moving away from the source. In

general, then, relative motion of source and observer toward one another increases the received frequency. Relative

motion apart decreases frequency. The greater the relative speed, the greater the effect.

The Doppler effect occurs not only for sound, but for any wave when there is relative motion between the observer
and the source. Doppler shifts occur in the frequency of sound, light, and water waves, for example. Doppler shifts
can be used to determine velocity, such as when ultrasound is reflected from blood in a medical diagnostic. The
relative velocities of stars and galaxies is determined by the shift in the frequencies of light received from them and
has implied much about the origins of the universe. Modern physics has been profoundly affected by observations of
Doppler shifts.

Derivation of the Observed Frequency due to the Doppler Shift

Consider two stationary observers X and Y in Figure 17.31, located on either side of a stationary source. Each
observer hears the same frequency, and that frequency is the frequency produced by the stationary source.

FIGURE 17.31 A stationary source sends out sound waves at a constant frequency with a constant wavelength at the speed of

sound v. Two stationary observers X and Y, on either side of the source, observe a frequency  , with a wavelength

Now consider a stationary observer X with a source moving away from the observer with a constant speed

(Figure 17.32). At time  , the source sends out a sound wave, indicated in black. This wave moves out at the
840  17 · Sound

     speed of sound v. The position of the sound wave at each time interval of period is shown as dotted lines. After

     one period, the source has moved  and emits a second sound wave, which moves out at the speed of

     sound. The source continues to move and produce sound waves, as indicated by the circles numbered 3 and 4.

     Notice that as the waves move out, they remained centered at their respective point of origin.

     FIGURE 17.32 A source moving at a constant speed away from an observer X. The moving source sends out sound waves at a constant
     frequency with a constant wavelength , at the speed of sound v. Snapshots of the source at an interval of are shown as the source
     moves away from the stationary observer X. The solid lines represent the position of the sound waves after four periods from the initial
     time. The dotted lines are used to show the positions of the waves at each time period. The observer hears a wavelength of

                                           .

     Using the fact that the wavelength is equal to the speed times the period, and the period is the inverse of the
     frequency, we can derive the observed frequency:

     As the source moves away from the observer, the observed frequency is lower than the source frequency.

     Now consider a source moving at a constant velocity moving toward a stationary observer Y, also shown in

     Figure 17.32. The wavelength is observed by Y as  Once again, using the fact that the

     wavelength is equal to the speed times the period, and the period is the inverse of the frequency, we can derive the

     observed frequency:

     When a source is moving and the observer is stationary, the observed frequency is

                                                                                                             17.18

     What happens if the observer is moving and the source is stationary? If the observer moves toward the stationary
     source, the observed frequency is higher than the source frequency. If the observer is moving away from the
     stationary source, the observed frequency is lower than the source frequency. Consider observer X in Figure 17.33

observed period                    At time  the observer starts at the beginning of a wavelength and moves

toward the second wavelength as the wavelength moves out from the source. The wavelength is equal to the

     The Doppler effect involves motion and a video (https://openstax.org/l/21doppler) will help visualize the effects of a
     moving observer or source. This video shows a moving source and a stationary observer, and a moving observer and
     a stationary source. It also discusses the Doppler effect and its application to light.

     EXAMPLE 17.8

     Calculating a Doppler Shift

     Suppose a train that has a 150-Hz horn is moving at 35.0 m/s in still air on a day when the speed of sound is 340 m/
     s.

     (a) What frequencies are observed by a stationary person at the side of the tracks as the train approaches and after
     it passes?

     (b) What frequency is observed by the train's engineer traveling on the train?

     Strategy

     To find the observed frequency in (a), we must use  because the source is moving. The minus sign

     is used for the approaching train, and the plus sign for the receding train. In (b), there are two Doppler shifts--one
     for a moving source and the other for a moving observer.

Calculate the frequency observed by a stationary person as the train approaches:

Use the same equation with the plus sign to find the frequency heard by a stationary person as the train
recedes:

     Calculate the second frequency:

b. Identify knowns:
       It seems reasonable that the engineer would receive the same frequency as emitted by the horn, because
           the relative velocity between them is zero.
       Relative to the medium (air), the speeds are
       The first Doppler shift is for the moving observer; the second is for the moving source.

     Use the following equation:

The quantity in the square brackets is the Doppler-shifted frequency due to a moving observer. The factor on

the right is the effect of the moving source.

Because the train engineer is moving in the direction toward the horn, we must use the plus sign for

however, because the horn is also moving in the direction away from the engineer, we also use the plus sign

for But the train is carrying both the engineer and the horn at the same velocity, so  As a result,

everything but cancels, yielding

Significance

For the case where the source and the observer are not moving together, the numbers calculated are valid when the
source (in this case, the train) is far enough away that the motion is nearly along the line joining source and observer.
In both cases, the shift is significant and easily noticed. Note that the shift is 17.0 Hz for motion toward and 14.0 Hz
for motion away. The shifts are not symmetric.

For the engineer riding in the train, we may expect that there is no change in frequency because the source and
observer move together. This matches your experience. For example, there is no Doppler shift in the frequency of
conversations between driver and passenger on a motorcycle. People talking when a wind moves the air between
them also observe no Doppler shift in their conversation. The crucial point is that source and observer are not
moving relative to each other.

The Doppler effect and the Doppler shift have many important applications in science and engineering. For example,
the Doppler shift in ultrasound can be used to measure blood velocity, and police use the Doppler shift in radar (a
microwave) to measure car velocities. In meteorology, the Doppler shift is used to track the motion of storm clouds;

     such "Doppler Radar" can give the velocity and direction of rain or snow in weather fronts. In astronomy, we can
     examine the light emitted from distant galaxies and determine their speed relative to ours. As galaxies move away
     from us, their light is shifted to a lower frequency, and so to a longer wavelength--the so-called red shift. Such
     information from galaxies far, far away has allowed us to estimate the age of the universe (from the Big Bang) as
     about 14 billion years.

     17.8 Shock Waves

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the mechanism behind sonic booms
         · Describe the difference between sonic booms and shock waves
         · Describe a bow wake

     When discussing the Doppler effect of a moving source and a stationary observer, the only cases we considered

     were cases where the source was moving at speeds that were less than the speed of sound. Recall that the

     observed frequency for a moving source approaching a stationary observer is  As the source

     approaches the speed of sound, the observed frequency increases. According to the equation, if the source moves
     at the speed of sound, the denominator is equal to zero, implying the observed frequency is infinite. If the source
     moves at speeds greater than the speed of sound, the observed frequency is negative.

     What could this mean? What happens when a source approaches the speed of sound? It was once argued by some
     scientists that such a large pressure wave would result from the constructive interference of the sound waves, that it
     would be impossible for a plane to exceed the speed of sound because the pressures would be great enough to
     destroy the airplane. But now planes routinely fly faster than the speed of sound. On July 28, 1976, Captain Eldon
     W. Joersz and Major George T. Morgan flew a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird #61-7958 at 3529.60 km/h (2193.20 mi/
     h), which is Mach 2.85. The Mach number is the speed of the source divided by the speed of sound:

                                                                                                               17.21

     You will see that interesting phenomena occur when a source approaches and exceeds the speed of sound.

     Doppler Effect and High Velocity

     What happens to the sound produced by a moving source, such as a jet airplane, that approaches or even exceeds
     the speed of sound? The answer to this question applies not only to sound but to all other waves as well. Suppose a
     jet plane is coming nearly straight at you, emitting a sound of frequency The greater the plane's speed the
     greater the Doppler shift and the greater the value observed for (Figure 17.35).

     FIGURE 17.35 Because of the Doppler shift, as a moving source approaches a stationary observer, the observed frequency is higher than
     the source frequency. The faster the source is moving, the higher the observed frequency. In this figure, the source in (b) is moving faster
     than the source in (a). Shown are four time steps, the first three shown as dotted lines. (c) If a source moves at the speed of sound, each
     successive wave interfere with the previous one and the observer observes them all at the same instant.

Now, as approaches the speed of sound, approaches infinity, because the denominator in
approaches zero. At the speed of sound, this result means that in front of the source, each successive wave
interferes with the previous one because the source moves forward at the speed of sound. The observer gets them
all at the same instant, so the frequency is infinite [part (c) of the figure].

Shock Waves and Sonic Booms

If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the observer until the source has passed, so that
the sounds from the approaching source are mixed with those from it when receding. This mixing appears messy,
but something interesting happens--a shock wave is created (Figure 17.36).

FIGURE 17.36 Sound waves from a source that moves faster than the speed of sound spread spherically from the point where they are
emitted, but the source moves ahead of each wave. Constructive interference along the lines shown (actually a cone in three dimensions)
creates a shock wave called a sonic boom. The faster the speed of the source, the smaller the angle .

Constructive interference along the lines shown (a cone in three dimensions) from similar sound waves arriving

there simultaneously. This superposition forms a disturbance called a shock wave, a constructive interference of

sound created by an object moving faster than sound. Inside the cone, the interference is mostly destructive, so the

sound intensity there is much less than on the shock wave. The angle of the shock wave can be found from the

geometry. In time t the source has moved and the sound wave has moved a distance vt and the angle can be

found using                  Note that the Mach number is defined as so the sine of the angle equals the

inverse of the Mach number,

                             17.22

You may have heard of the common term `sonic boom.' A common misconception is that the sonic boom occurs as
the plane breaks the sound barrier; that is, accelerates to a speed higher than the speed of sound. Actually, the
sonic boom occurs as the shock wave sweeps along the ground.

An aircraft creates two shock waves, one from its nose and one from its tail (Figure 17.37). During television
coverage of space shuttle landings, two distinct booms could often be heard. These were separated by exactly the
time it would take the shuttle to pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not see the aircraft creating the
sonic boom, because it has passed by before the shock wave reaches them, as seen in the figure. If the aircraft flies
close by at low altitude, pressures in the sonic boom can be destructive and break windows as well as rattle nerves.
Because of how destructive sonic booms can be, researchers have developed experimental aircraft and components
846  17 · Sound

     to reduce their impact. Many of these efforts were led by Christine Darden, a "human computer" who advanced to
     become the head of a NASA program dedicated to predicting and reducing sonic booms. From the 1960's until the
     late 1990's, Darden employed new materials, innovative designs, and advanced computer simulations. She led
     experiments involving panels placed on the aircraft that dispersed the shock waves. In recent years, these
     principles have been revisited and advanced, including in an experimental plane, the X-59, designed for quieter and
     more efficient flight.

     FIGURE 17.37 Two sonic booms experienced by observers, created by the nose and tail of an aircraft as the shock wave sweeps along the
     ground, are observed on the ground after the plane has passed by.

     Shock waves are one example of a broader phenomenon called bow wakes. A bow wake, such as the one in Figure

     17.38, is created when the wave source moves faster than the wave propagation speed. Water waves spread out in

     circles from the point where created, and the bow wake is the familiar V-shaped wake, trailing the source. A more

     exotic bow wake is created when a subatomic particle travels through a medium faster than the speed of light

1.7      or 30 km. It is probably an underestimate because the density of the atmosphere decreases with

     altitude. (In fact, 30 km does not even get us out of the stratosphere.)

1.8 No, the coach's new stopwatch will not be helpful. The uncertainty in the stopwatch is too great to

     differentiate between the sprint times effectively.

Conceptual Questions

 1. Physics is the science concerned with describing the interactions of energy, matter, space, and time to
      uncover the fundamental mechanisms that underlie every phenomenon.

 3. No, neither of these two theories is more valid than the other. Experimentation is the ultimate decider. If
      experimental evidence does not suggest one theory over the other, then both are equally valid. A given
      physicist might prefer one theory over another on the grounds that one seems more simple, more natural, or
      more beautiful than the other, but that physicist would quickly acknowledge that he or she cannot say the
      other theory is invalid. Rather, he or she would be honest about the fact that more experimental evidence is
      needed to determine which theory is a better description of nature.

 5. Probably not. As the saying goes, "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."
 7. Conversions between units require factors of 10 only, which simplifies calculations. Also, the same basic units

      can be scaled up or down using metric prefixes to sizes appropriate for the problem at hand.
 9. a. Base units are defined by a particular process of measuring a base quantity whereas derived units are

      defined as algebraic combinations of base units. b. A base quantity is chosen by convention and practical
      considerations. Derived quantities are expressed as algebraic combinations of base quantities. c. A base unit
      is a standard for expressing the measurement of a base quantity within a particular system of units. So, a
      measurement of a base quantity could be expressed in terms of a base unit in any system of units using the
      same base quantities. For example, length is a base quantity in both SI and the English system, but the meter
      is a base unit in the SI system only.
11. a. Uncertainty is a quantitative measure of precision. b. Discrepancy is a quantitative measure of accuracy.
13. Check to make sure it makes sense and assess its significance.

89. Since each term in the power series involves the argument raised to a different power, the only way that every

      term in the power series can have the same dimension is if the argument is dimensionless. To see this
      explicitly, suppose [x] = LaMbTc. Then, [xn] = [x]n = LanMbnTcn. If we want [x] = [xn], then an = a, bn = b, and cn

      = c for all n. The only way this can happen is if a = b = c = 0.

3.1 (a) The rider's displacement is                  . (The displacement is negative because we take east

     to be positive and west to be negative.) (b) The distance traveled is 3 km + 2 km = 5 km. (c) The magnitude of

     the displacement is 1 km.

3.2 (a) Taking the derivative of x(t) gives v(t) = -6t m/s. (b) No, because time can never be negative. (c) The

     velocity is v(1.0 s) = -6 m/s and the speed is  .

3.3 Inserting the knowns, we have

3.4 If we take east to be positive, then the airplane has negative acceleration because it is accelerating toward the
      west. It is also acceleration opposite to the motion; its acceleration is opposite in direction to its velocity.

3.5 To answer this, choose an equation that allows us to solve for time t, given only a , v0 , and v:

      Rearrange to solve for t:

3.6        .

3.7 It takes 2.47 s to hit the water. The quantity distance traveled increases faster.
3.8 a. The velocity function is the integral of the acceleration function plus a constant of integration. By

              Equation 3.18,

               Since v(0) = 0, we have C1 = 0; so,

          b. By Equation 3.19,

               Since x(0) = 0, we have C2 = 0, and

          c. The velocity can be written as v(t) = 5t(1 - t), which equals zero at t = 0, and t = 1 s.

        returning to your home, your average speed is a positive number. Since Average velocity = Displacement/
        Elapsed time, your average velocity is zero.

17. If the acceleration, time, and displacement are the knowns, and the initial and final velocities are the

     unknowns, then two kinematic equations must be solved simultaneously. Also if the final velocity, time, and

     displacement are the knowns then two kinematic equations must be solved for the initial velocity and

     acceleration.

        velocity is not equal to the instantaneous velocity. We check this and find

      which is different from
4.2 The acceleration vector is constant and doesn't change with time. If a, b, and c are not zero, then the velocity

        unrestricted bodies in motion, and when the car suddenly stopped, the cupcakes kept moving forward
        according to Newton's first law.
    5. No. If the force were zero at this point, then there would be nothing to change the object's momentary zero
        velocity. Since we do not observe the object hanging motionless in the air, the force could not be zero.

    9. The force you exert (a contact force equal in magnitude to your weight) is small. Earth is extremely massive
        by comparison. Thus, the acceleration of Earth would be incredibly small. To see this, use Newton's second
        law to calculate the acceleration you would cause if your weight is 600.0 N and the mass of Earth is

        opposite end of the barrel. c. It is not safe to stand behind a recoilless rifle.
  15. a. Yes, the force can be acting to the left; the particle would experience acceleration opposite to the motion

53. Because the weight of the history book is the force exerted by Earth on the history book, we represent it as

                    Aside from this, the history book interacts only with the physics book. Because the

     acceleration of the history book is zero, the net force on it is zero by Newton's second law:

     where is the force exerted by the physics book on the history book. Thus,

                                           We find that the physics book exerts an upward force of magnitude

     14 N on the history book. The physics book has three forces exerted on it: due to Earth, due to the

     history book, and due to the desktop. Since the physics book weighs 18 N,                          From

     Newton's third law,           so                 Newton's second law applied to the physics book gives

                or                     so                                           The desk exerts an upward

      force of 32 N on the physics book. To arrive at this solution, we apply Newton's second law twice and
      Newton's third law once.

Conceptual Questions

1. The scale is in free fall along with the astronauts, so the reading on the scale would be 0. There is no
    difference in the apparent weightlessness; in the aircraft and in orbit, free fall is occurring.

3. If you do not let up on the brake pedal, the car's wheels will lock so that they are not rolling; sliding friction is
    now involved and the sudden change (due to the larger force of static friction) causes the jerk.

5. 5.00 N
7. Centripetal force is defined as any net force causing uniform circular motion. The centripetal force is not a

    new kind of force. The label "centripetal" refers to any force that keeps something turning in a circle. That
    force could be tension, gravity, friction, electrical attraction, the normal force, or any other force. Any
    combination of these could be the source of centripetal force, for example, the centripetal force at the top of
    the path of a tetherball swung through a vertical circle is the result of both tension and gravity.
9. The driver who cuts the corner (on Path 2) has a more gradual curve, with a larger radius. That one will be the
    better racing line. If the driver goes too fast around a corner using a racing line, he will still slide off the track;
    the key is to stay at the maximum value of static friction. So, the driver wants maximum possible speed and
902 Answer Key

     maximum friction. Consider the equation for centripetal force:                  where v is speed and r is the radius

     of curvature. So by decreasing the curvature (1/r) of the path that the car takes, we reduce the amount of

     force the tires have to exert on the road, meaning we can now increase the speed, v. Looking at this from the

     point of view of the driver on Path 1, we can reason this way: the sharper the turn, the smaller the turning

     circle; the smaller the turning circle, the larger is the required centripetal force. If this centripetal force is not

     exerted, the result is a skid.

11. The barrel of the dryer provides a centripetal force on the clothes (including the water droplets) to keep them

     moving in a circular path. As a water droplet comes to one of the holes in the barrel, it will move in a path

     tangent to the circle.

13. (a) If there is no friction, then there is no centripetal force. This means that in the inertial frame of the ground,

     the lunch box will move along a straight path tangent to the circle, and thus follows path B. This is a result of

     Newton's first law of motion. (b) The dust trail traces the motion of the box relative to the merry-go-round and

     will be radially out.

15. There must be a centripetal force to maintain the circular motion; this is provided by the nail at the center.

     Newton's third law explains the phenomenon. The action force is the force of the string on the mass; the

     reaction force is the force of the mass on the string. This reaction force causes the string to stretch.

17. Since the radial friction with the tires supplies the centripetal force, and friction is nearly 0 when the car

     encounters the ice, the car will obey Newton's first law and go off the road in a straight line path, tangent to

     the curve. A common misconception is that the car will follow a curved path off the road.

19. Anna is correct. The satellite is freely falling toward Earth due to gravity, even though gravity is weaker at the

     altitude of the satellite, and g is not      . Free fall does not depend on the value of g; that is, you could

     experience free fall on Mars if you jumped off Olympus Mons (the tallest volcano in the solar system).

21. The pros of wearing body suits include: (1) the body suit reduces the drag force on the swimmer and the

     athlete can move more easily; (2) the tightness of the suit reduces the surface area of the athlete, and even

     though this is a small amount, it can make a difference in performance time. The cons of wearing body suits

     are: (1) The tightness of the suits can induce cramping and breathing problems. (2) Heat will be retained and

     thus the athlete could overheat during a long period of use.

23. The oil is less dense than the water and so rises to the top when a light rain falls and collects on the road. This

     creates a dangerous situation in which friction is greatly lowered, and so a car can lose control. In a heavy

     rain, the oil is dispersed and does not affect the motion of cars as much.

Conceptual Questions

1. When you push on the wall, this "feels" like work; however, there is no displacement so there is no physical

     work. Energy is consumed, but no energy is transferred.

3. If you continue to push on a wall without breaking through the wall, you continue to exert a force with no

     displacement, so no work is done.

5. The total displacement of the ball is zero, so no work is done.

7. Both require the same gravitational work, but the stairs allow Tarzan to take this work over a longer time

     interval and hence gradually exert his energy, rather than dramatically by climbing a vine.

9. The first particle has a kinetic energy of       whereas the second particle has a kinetic energy of

                so the first particle has twice the kinetic energy of the second particle.

11. The mower would gain energy if                  It would lose energy if                       The mower may

     also lose energy due to friction with the grass while pushing; however, we are not concerned with that energy

     loss for this problem.

13. The second marble has twice the kinetic energy of the first because kinetic energy is directly proportional to

     mass, like the work done by gravity.

15. Unless the environment is nearly frictionless, you are doing some positive work on the environment to cancel

     out the frictional work against you, resulting in zero total work producing a constant velocity.

17. Appliances are rated in terms of the energy consumed in a relatively small time interval. It does not matter

     how long the appliance is on, only the rate of change of energy per unit time.

19. The spark occurs over a relatively short time span, thereby delivering a very low amount of energy to your

     body.

21. If the force is antiparallel or points in an opposite direction to the velocity, the power expended can be

     negative.

Conceptual Questions

 1. The potential energy of a system can be negative because its value is relative to a defined point.
 3. If the reference point of the ground is zero gravitational potential energy, the javelin first increases its

      gravitational potential energy, followed by a decrease in its gravitational potential energy as it is thrown until
      it hits the ground. The overall change in gravitational potential energy of the javelin is zero unless the center
      of mass of the javelin is lower than from where it is initially thrown, and therefore would have slightly less
      gravitational potential energy.
 5. the vertical height from the ground to the object
 7. A force that takes energy away from the system that can't be recovered if we were to reverse the action.
 9. The change in kinetic energy is the net work. Since conservative forces are path independent, when you are
      back to the same point the kinetic and potential energies are exactly the same as the beginning. During the
      trip the total energy is conserved, but both the potential and kinetic energy change.
11. The car experiences a change in gravitational potential energy as it goes down the hills because the vertical
      distance is decreasing. Some of this change of gravitational potential energy will be taken away by work done
      by friction. The rest of the energy results in a kinetic energy increase, making the car go faster. Lastly, the car
      brakes and will lose its kinetic energy to the work done by braking to a stop.

9.5 Consider the impulse momentum theory, which is           . If      , we have the situation described in the
      example. If a force acts on the system, then
                                                             . Thus, instead of  , we have

      where  is the force due to friction.

9.6 The impulse is the change in momentum multiplied by the time required for the change to occur. By

      conservation of momentum, the changes in momentum of the probe and the comment are of the same

      magnitude, but in opposite directions, and the interaction time for each is also the same. Therefore, the

      impulse each receives is of the same magnitude, but in opposite directions. Because they act in opposite

      directions, the impulses are not the same. As for the impulse, the force on each body acts in opposite

      directions, so the forces on each are not equal. However, the change in kinetic energy differs for each, because

      the collision is not elastic.

9.7 This solution represents the case in which no interaction takes place: the first puck misses the second puck

      and continues on with a velocity of 2.5 m/s to the left. This case offers no meaningful physical insights.

9.8 If zero friction acts on the car, then it will continue to slide indefinitely (  ), so we cannot use the work-

 9.9  energy theorem as is done in the example. Thus, we could not solve the problem from the information given.
9.10  Were the initial velocities not at right angles, then one or both of the velocities would have to be expressed in
      component form. The mathematical analysis of the problem would be slightly more involved, but the physical
      result would not change.
      The volume of a scuba tank is about 11 L. Assuming air is an ideal gas, the number of gas molecules in the
      tank is

      The average molecular mass of air is 29 g/mol, so the mass of air contained in the tank is about 2.2 kg. This is

      about 10 times less than the mass of the tank, so it is safe to neglect it. Also, the initial force of the air

      pressure is roughly proportional to the surface area of each piece, which is in turn proportional to the mass of

      each piece (assuming uniform thickness). Thus, the initial acceleration of each piece would change very little

      if we explicitly consider the air.

9.11  The average radius of Earth's orbit around the Sun is            . Taking the Sun to be the origin, and

        Thus, the center of mass of the Sun, Earth, Moon system is 4.6 km from the center of the Sun.
9.12 On a macroscopic scale, the size of a unit cell is negligible and the crystal mass may be considered to be

        distributed homogeneously throughout the crystal. Thus,

      where we sum over the number N of unit cells in the crystal and m is the mass of a unit cell. Because Nm = M,
      we can write

      This is the definition of the geometric center of the crystal, so the center of mass is at the same point as the

      geometric center.

9.13  The explosions would essentially be spherically symmetric, because gravity would not act to distort the

      trajectories of the expanding projectiles.

      The notation stands for the mass of the fuel and m stands for the mass of the rocket plus the initial mass

      of the fuel. Note that changes with time, so we write it as  . Using as the mass of the rocket with

      no fuel, the total mass of the rocket plus fuel is           . Differentiation with respect to time gives

      where we used           because the mass of the rocket does not change. Thus, time rate of change of the

      mass of the rocket is the same as that of the fuel.

Conceptual Questions

1. Since                 , then if the momentum is fixed, the object with smaller mass has more kinetic energy.

3. Yes; impulse is the force applied multiplied by the time during which it is applied (          ), so if a small

      force acts for a long time, it may result in a larger impulse than a large force acting for a small time.

5. By friction, the road exerts a horizontal force on the tires of the car, which changes the momentum of the car.

7. Momentum is conserved when the mass of the system of interest remains constant during the interaction in

      question and when no net external force acts on the system during the interaction.

9. To accelerate air molecules in the direction of motion of the car, the car must exert a force on these molecules

      by Newton's second law       . By Newton's third law, the air molecules exert a force of equal

      magnitude but in the opposite direction on the car. This force acts in the direction opposite the motion of the

      car and constitutes the force due to air resistance.

11. No, he is not a closed system because a net nonzero external force acts on him in the form of the starting

      blocks pushing on his feet.

13. Yes, all the kinetic energy can be lost if the two masses come to rest due to the collision (i.e., they stick

      together).

15. The angle between the directions must be 90°. Any system that has zero net external force in one direction

      and nonzero net external force in a perpendicular direction will satisfy these conditions.

17. Yes, the rocket speed can exceed the exhaust speed of the gases it ejects. The thrust of the rocket does not

      depend on the relative speeds of the gases and rocket, it simply depends on conservation of momentum.

        angle to keep rolling motion without slipping.

    5. The cylinder reaches a greater height. By Equation 11.4, its acceleration in the direction down the incline
        would be less.

13.1  The force of gravity on each object increases with the square of the inverse distance as they fall together, and

13.2  hence so does the acceleration. For example, if the distance is halved, the force and acceleration are
13.3
      quadrupled. Our average is accurate only for a linearly increasing acceleration, whereas the acceleration

      actually increases at a greater rate. So our calculated speed is too small. From Newton's third law (action-

      reaction forces), the force of gravity between any two objects must be the same. But the accelerations will not

      be if they have different masses.

      The tallest buildings in the world are all less than 1 km. Since g is proportional to the distance squared from

      Earth's center, a simple ratio shows that the change in g at 1 km above Earth's surface is less than 0.0001%.

      There would be no need to consider this in structural design.

      The value of g drops by about 10% over this change in height. So    will give too large a

      value. If we use           , then we get

      which is about 6% greater than that found with the correct method.

13.4 The probe must overcome both the gravitational pull of Earth and the Sun. In the second calculation of our

      example, we found the speed necessary to escape the Sun from a distance of Earth's orbit, not from Earth

      itself. The proper way to find this value is to start with the energy equation, Equation 13.5, in which you would

      include a potential energy term for both Earth and the Sun.

13.5 You change the direction of your velocity with a force that is perpendicular to the velocity at all points. In

      effect, you must constantly adjust the thrusters, creating a centripetal force until your momentum changes

      from tangential to radial. A simple momentum vector diagram shows that the net change in momentum is

      times the magnitude of momentum itself. This turns out to be a very inefficient way to reach Mars. We discuss

      the most efficient way in Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion.

13.6 In Equation 13.7, the radius appears in the denominator inside the square root. So the radius must increase

      by a factor of 4, to decrease the orbital velocity by a factor of 2. The circumference of the orbit has also

      increased by this factor of 4, and so with half the orbital velocity, the period must be 8 times longer. That can

      also be seen directly from Equation 13.8.

13.7 The assumption is that orbiting object is much less massive than the body it is orbiting. This is not really

      justified in the case of the Moon and Earth. Both Earth and the Moon orbit about their common center of mass.

      We tackle this issue in the next example.

13.8 The stars on the "inside" of each galaxy will be closer to the other galaxy and hence will feel a greater

      gravitational force than those on the outside. Consequently, they will have a greater acceleration. Even

      without this force difference, the inside stars would be orbiting at a smaller radius, and, hence, there would

      develop an elongation or stretching of each galaxy. The force difference only increases this effect.

13.9 The semi-major axis for the highly elliptical orbit of Halley's comet is 17.8 AU and is the average of the

      perihelion and aphelion. This lies between the 9.5 AU and 19 AU orbital radii for Saturn and Uranus,

      respectively. The radius for a circular orbit is the same as the semi-major axis, and since the period increases

      with an increase of the semi-major axis, the fact that Halley's period is between the periods of Saturn and

      Uranus is expected.

13.10 Consider the last equation above. The values of and remain nearly the same, but the diameter of the

      Moon,             , is one-fourth that of Earth. So the tidal forces on the Moon are about one-fourth as great as

      on Earth.

13.11 Given the incredible density required to force an Earth-sized body to become a black hole, we do not expect

      to see such small black holes. Even a body with the mass of our Sun would have to be compressed by a

      factor of 80 beyond that of a neutron star. It is believed that stars of this size cannot become black holes.

      However, for stars with a few solar masses, it is believed that gravitational collapse at the end of a star's life

      could form a black hole. As we will discuss later, it is now believed that black holes are common at the center

      of galaxies. These galactic black holes typically contain the mass of many millions of stars.

Conceptual Questions

 1. The ultimate truth is experimental verification. Field theory was developed to help explain how force is
      exerted without objects being in contact for both gravity and electromagnetic forces that act at the speed of
      light. It has only been since the twentieth century that we have been able to measure that the force is not
      conveyed immediately.

 3. The centripetal acceleration is not directed along the gravitational force and therefore the correct line of the
      building (i.e., the plumb bob line) is not directed towards the center of Earth. But engineers use either a
      plumb bob or a transit, both of which respond to both the direction of gravity and acceleration. No special
      consideration for their location on Earth need be made.

 5. As we move to larger orbits, the change in potential energy increases, whereas the orbital velocity decreases.
      Hence, the ratio is highest near Earth's surface (technically infinite if we orbit at Earth's surface with no
      elevation change), moving to zero as we reach infinitely far away.

 7. The period of the orbit must be 24 hours. But in addition, the satellite must be located in an equatorial orbit
      and orbiting in the same direction as Earth's rotation. All three criteria must be met for the satellite to remain
      in one position relative to Earth's surface. At least three satellites are needed, as two on opposite sides of
      Earth cannot communicate with each other. (This is not technically true, as a wavelength could be chosen that
      provides sufficient diffraction. But it would be totally impractical.)

 9. The speed is greatest where the satellite is closest to the large mass and least where farther away--at the
      periapsis and apoapsis, respectively. It is conservation of angular momentum that governs this relationship.
      But it can also be gleaned from conservation of energy, the kinetic energy must be greatest where the
      gravitational potential energy is the least (most negative). The force, and hence acceleration, is always
      directed towards M in the diagram, and the velocity is always tangent to the path at all points. The
      acceleration vector has a tangential component along the direction of the velocity at the upper location on the
      y-axis; hence, the satellite is speeding up. Just the opposite is true at the lower position.

11. The laser beam will hit the far wall at a lower elevation than it left, as the floor is accelerating upward.
      Relative to the lab, the laser beam "falls." So we would expect this to happen in a gravitational field. The mass
      of light, or even an object with mass, is not relevant.

14.1  The pressure found in part (a) of the example is completely independent of the width and length of the lake; it
14.2  depends only on its average depth at the dam. Thus, the force depends only on the water's average depth and
14.3  the dimensions of the dam, not on the horizontal extent of the reservoir. In the diagram, note that the
      thickness of the dam increases with depth to balance the increasing force due to the increasing pressure.
      The density of mercury is 13.6 times greater than the density of water. It takes approximately 76 cm (29.9 in.)
      of mercury to measure the pressure of the atmosphere, whereas it would take approximately 10 m (34 ft.) of
      water.
      Yes, it would still work, but since a gas is compressible, it would not operate as efficiently. When the force is
      applied, the gas would first compress and warm. Hence, the air in the brake lines must be bled out in order for
      the brakes to work properly.

Conceptual Questions

 1. Mercury and water are liquid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Air is a gas at room
      temperature and atmospheric pressure. Glass is an amorphous solid (non-crystalline) material at room
      temperature and atmospheric pressure. At one time, it was thought that glass flowed, but flowed very slowly.
      This theory came from the observation that old glass planes were thicker at the bottom. It is now thought
      unlikely that this theory is accurate.

 3. The density of air decreases with altitude. For a column of air of a constant temperature, the density
      decreases exponentially with altitude. This is a fair approximation, but since the temperature does change
      with altitude, it is only an approximation.

 5. Pressure is force divided by area. If a knife is sharp, the force applied to the cutting surface is divided over a
      smaller area than the same force applied with a dull knife. This means that the pressure would be greater for
      the sharper knife, increasing its ability to cut.

 7. If the two chunks of ice had the same volume, they would produce the same volume of water. The glacier
      would cause the greatest rise in the lake, however, because part of the floating chunk of ice is already
      submerged in the lake, and is thus already contributing to the lake's level.

 9. The pressure is acting all around your body, assuming you are not in a vacuum.
11. Because the river level is very high, it has started to leak under the levee. Sandbags are placed around the

      leak, and the water held by them rises until it is the same level as the river, at which point the water there
      stops rising. The sandbags will absorb water until the water reaches the height of the water in the levee.
13. Atmospheric pressure does not affect the gas pressure in a rigid tank, but it does affect the pressure inside a
      balloon. In general, atmospheric pressure affects fluid pressure unless the fluid is enclosed in a rigid
      container.
15. The pressure of the atmosphere is due to the weight of the air above. The pressure, force per area, on the
      manometer will be the same at the same depth of the atmosphere.
17. Not at all. Pascal's principle says that the change in the pressure is exerted through the fluid. The reason that
      the full tub requires more force to pull the plug is because of the weight of the water above the plug.
19. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. The greater the density of the fluid, the less
      fluid that is needed to be displaced to have the weight of the object be supported and to float. Since the
      density of salt water is higher than that of fresh water, less salt water will be displaced, and the ship will float
      higher.
21. Consider two different pipes connected to a single pipe of a smaller diameter, with fluid flowing from the two
      pipes into the smaller pipe. Since the fluid is forced through a smaller cross-sectional area, it must move
      faster as the flow lines become closer together. Likewise, if a pipe with a large radius feeds into a pipe with a
      small radius, the stream lines will become closer together and the fluid will move faster.
23. The mass of water that enters a cross-sectional area must equal the amount that leaves. From the continuity
      equation, we know that the density times the area times the velocity must remain constant. Since the density
924 Answer Key

      of the water does not change, the velocity times the cross-sectional area entering a region must equal the
      cross-sectional area times the velocity leaving the region. Since the velocity of the fountain stream decreases
      as it rises due to gravity, the area must increase. Since the velocity of the faucet stream speeds up as it falls,
      the area must decrease.
25. When the tube narrows, the fluid is forced to speed up, thanks to the continuity equation and the work done
      on the fluid. Where the tube is narrow, the pressure decreases. This means that the entrained fluid will be
      pushed into the narrow area.
27. The work done by pressure can be used to increase the kinetic energy and to gain potential energy. As the
      height becomes larger, there is less energy left to give to kinetic energy. Eventually, there will be a maximum
      height that cannot be overcome.
29. Because of the speed of the air outside the building, the pressure outside the house decreases. The greater
      pressure inside the building can essentially blow off the roof or cause the building to explode.
31. The air inside the hose has kinetic energy due to its motion. The kinetic energy can be used to do work against
      the pressure difference.
33. Potential energy due to position, kinetic energy due to velocity, and the work done by a pressure difference.
35. The water has kinetic energy due to its motion. This energy can be converted into work against the difference
      in pressure.
37. The water in the center of the stream is moving faster than the water near the shore due to resistance
      between the water and the shore and between the layers of fluid. There is also probably more turbulence
      near the shore, which will also slow the water down. When paddling up stream, the water pushes against the
      canoe, so it is better to stay near the shore to minimize the force pushing against the canoe. When moving
      downstream, the water pushes the canoe, increasing its velocity, so it is better to stay in the middle of the
      stream to maximize this effect.
39. You would expect the speed to be slower after the obstruction. Resistance is increased due to the reduction
      in size of the opening, and turbulence will be created because of the obstruction, both of which will clause the
      fluid to slow down.

15.1  The ruler is a stiffer system, which carries greater force for the same amount of displacement. The ruler snaps

15.6  The movement of the pendulums will not differ at all because the mass of the bob has no effect on the motion
      of a simple pendulum. The pendulums are only affected by the period (which is related to the pendulum's

      The performer must be singing a note that corresponds to the natural frequency of the glass. As the sound
      wave is directed at the glass, the glass responds by resonating at the same frequency as the sound wave. With
      enough energy introduced into the system, the glass begins to vibrate and eventually shatters.

Conceptual Questions

1. The restoring force must be proportional to the displacement and act opposite to the direction of motion with

      no drag forces or friction. The frequency of oscillation does not depend on the amplitude.

3. Examples: Mass attached to a spring on a frictionless table, a mass hanging from a string, a simple pendulum

      with a small amplitude of motion. All of these examples have frequencies of oscillation that are independent

      of amplitude.

5. Since the frequency is proportional to the square root of the force constant and inversely proportional to the

      square root of the mass, it is likely that the truck is heavily loaded, since the force constant would be the

      same whether the truck is empty or heavily loaded.

7. In a car, elastic potential energy is stored when the shock is extended or compressed. In some running shoes

      elastic potential energy is stored in the compression of the material of the soles of the running shoes. In pole

      vaulting, elastic potential energy is stored in the bending of the pole.

9. The overall system is stable. There may be times when the stability is interrupted by a storm, but the driving

      force provided by the sun bring the atmosphere back into a stable pattern.

11. The maximum speed is equal to      and the angular frequency is independent of the amplitude, so

      the amplitude would be affected. The radius of the circle represents the amplitude of the circle, so make the

      amplitude larger.

13. The period of the pendulum is            In summer, the length increases, and the period increases. If

      the period should be one second, but period is longer than one second in the summer, it will oscillate fewer

      than 60 times a minute and clock will run slow. In the winter it will run fast.

15. A car shock absorber.

17. The second law of thermodynamics states that perpetual motion machines are impossible. Eventually the

      ordered motion of the system decreases and returns to equilibrium.

19. All harmonic motion is damped harmonic motion, but the damping may be negligible. This is due to friction

      and drag forces. It is easy to come up with five examples of damped motion: (1) A mass oscillating on a

      hanging on a spring (it eventually comes to rest). (2) Shock absorbers in a car (thankfully they also come to

      rest). (3) A pendulum is a grandfather clock (weights are added to add energy to the oscillations). (4) A child

      on a swing (eventually comes to rest unless energy is added by pushing the child). (5) A marble rolling in a

      bowl (eventually comes to rest). As for the undamped motion, even a mass on a spring in a vacuum will

      eventually come to rest due to internal forces in the spring. Damping may be negligible, but cannot be

      eliminated.

16.1  The wavelength of the waves depends on the frequency and the velocity of the wave. The frequency of the
16.2
16.3  sound wave is equal to the frequency of the wave on the string. The wavelengths of the sound waves and the

      waves on the string are equal only if the velocities of the waves are the same, which is not always the case. If

      the speed of the sound wave is different from the speed of the wave on the string, the wavelengths are

      different. This velocity of sound waves will be discussed in Sound.

      In a transverse wave, the wave may move at a constant propagation velocity through the medium, but the

      medium oscillates perpendicular to the motion of the wave. If the wave moves in the positive x-direction, the

      medium oscillates up and down in the y-direction. The velocity of the medium is therefore not constant, but

      the medium's velocity and acceleration are similar to that of the simple harmonic motion of a mass on a

      Since the speed of a wave on a taunt string is proportional to the square root of the tension divided by the

      linear density, the wave speed would increase by

      At first glance, the time-averaged power of a sinusoidal wave on a string may look proportional to the linear

      density of the string because  however, the speed of the wave depends on the linear density.

      Replacing the wave speed with  shows that the power is proportional to the square root of tension and

      proportional to the square root of the linear mass density:

16.7 Yes, the equations would work equally well for symmetric boundary conditions of a medium free to oscillate
        on each end where there was an antinode on each end. The normal modes of the first three modes are shown
        below. The dotted line shows the equilibrium position of the medium.

      Note that the first mode is two quarters, or one half, of a wavelength. The second mode is one quarter of a
      wavelength, followed by one half of a wavelength, followed by one quarter of a wavelength, or one full
      wavelength. The third mode is one and a half wavelengths. These are the same result as the string with a node
      on each end. The equations for symmetrical boundary conditions work equally well for fixed boundary
      conditions and free boundary conditions. These results will be revisited in the next chapter when discussing
      sound wave in an open tube.

Conceptual Questions

1. A wave on a guitar string is an example of a transverse wave. The disturbance of the string moves

      perpendicular to the propagation of the wave. The sound produced by the string is a longitudinal wave where

      the disturbance of the air moves parallel to the propagation of the wave.

3. Propagation speed is the speed of the wave propagating through the medium. If the wave speed is constant,

      the speed can be found by      The frequency is the number of wave that pass a point per unit time.

    The wavelength is directly proportional to the wave speed and inversely proportional to the frequency.
5. No, the distance you move your hand up and down will determine the amplitude of the wave. The wavelength

    will depend on the frequency you move your hand up and down, and the speed of the wave through the
    spring.
7. Light from the Sun and stars reach Earth through empty space where there is no medium present.
9. The wavelength is equal to the velocity of the wave times the frequency and the wave number is equal to

                so yes, the wave number will depend on the frequency and also depend on the velocity of the wave

      propagating through the spring.
11. The medium moves in simple harmonic motion as the wave propagates through the medium, continuously

      changing speed, therefore it accelerates. The acceleration of the medium is due to the restoring force of the
      medium, which acts in the opposite direction of the displacement.
13. The wave speed is proportional to the square root of the tension, so the speed is doubled.
15. Since the speed of a wave on a string is inversely proportional to the square root of the linear mass density,
      the speed would be higher in the low linear mass density of the string.

      would be out of phase with respect to the incident pulse, and would move at the same propagation speed as

      direction as the incident pulse, but at half the speed. The transmitted pulse would be in phase with the

     uncertainty in the distance is less than a kilometer, our answer to part (a) does not seem to limit the detection

     of nuclear bomb detonations. However, if the velocities are uncertain, then the uncertainty in the distance

     would increase and could then make it difficult to identify the source of the seismic waves.

Chapter 17

Check Your Understanding

17.1  Sound and light both travel at definite speeds, and the speed of sound is slower than the speed of light. The
      first shell is probably very close by, so the speed difference is not noticeable. The second shell is farther away,
17.2  so the light arrives at your eyes noticeably sooner than the sound wave arrives at your ears.
17.3  10 dB: rustle of leaves; 50 dB: average office; 100 dB: noisy factory
17.4  Amplitude is directly proportional to the experience of loudness. As amplitude increases, loudness increases.
17.5  In the example, the two speakers were producing sound at a single frequency. Music has various frequencies
17.6  and wavelengths.
      Regular headphones only block sound waves with a physical barrier. Noise-canceling headphones use
17.7  destructive interference to reduce the loudness of outside sounds.
      When the tube resonates at its natural frequency, the wave's node is located at the closed end of the tube,
      and the antinode is located at the open end. The length of the tube is equal to one-fourth of the wavelength of
      this wave. Thus, if we know the wavelength of the wave, we can determine the length of the tube.
      Compare their sizes. High-pitch instruments are generally smaller than low-pitch instruments because they
934 Answer Key

        generate a smaller wavelength.
17.8 An easy way to understand this event is to use a graph, as shown below. It appears that beats are produced,

        but with a more complex pattern of interference.

17.9 If I am driving and I hear Doppler shift in an ambulance siren, I would be able to tell when it was getting
        closer and also if it has passed by. This would help me to know whether I needed to pull over and let the
        ambulance through.

Conceptual Questions

1. Sound is a disturbance of matter (a pressure wave) that is transmitted from its source outward. Hearing is the

human perception of sound.

3. Consider a sound wave moving through air. The pressure of the air is the equilibrium condition, it is the

change in pressure that produces the sound wave.

5. The frequency does not change as the sound wave moves from one medium to another. Since the speed

changes and the frequency does not, the wavelength must change. This is similar to the driving force of a

harmonic oscillator or a wave on the string.

7. The transducer sends out a sound wave, which reflects off the object in question and measures the time it

takes for the sound wave to return. Since the speed of sound is constant, the distance to the object can found

by multiplying the velocity of sound by half the time interval measured.

9. The ear plugs reduce the intensity of the sound both in water and on land, but Navy researchers have found

that sound under water is heard through vibrations mastoid, which is the bone behind the ear.

11. The fundamental wavelength of a tube open at each end is 2L, where the wavelength of a tube open at one

end and closed at one end is 4L. The tube open at one end has the lower fundamental frequency, assuming

the speed of sound is the same in both tubes.

13. The wavelength in each is twice the length of the tube. The frequency depends on the wavelength and the

speed of the sound waves. The frequency in room B is higher because the speed of sound is higher where the

temperature is higher.

15. When resonating at the fundamental frequency, the wavelength for pipe C is 4L, and for pipes A and B is 2L.

The frequency is equal to        Pipe C has the lowest frequency and pipes A and B have equal

frequencies, higher than the one in pipe C.

17. Since the boundary conditions are both symmetric, the frequencies are  Since the speed is the same

      in each, the frequencies are the same. If the wave speed were doubled in the string, the frequencies in the
      string would be twice the frequencies in the tube.
19. The frequency of the unknown fork is 255 Hz. No, if only the 250 Hz fork is used, listening to the beat
      frequency could only limit the possible frequencies to 245 Hz or 255 Hz.
21. The beat frequency is 0.7 Hz.
23. Observer 1 will observe the highest frequency. Observer 2 will observe the lowest frequency. Observer 3 will
      hear a higher frequency than the source frequency, but lower than the frequency observed by observer 1, as
      the source approaches and a lower frequency than the source frequency, but higher than the frequency
      observed by observer 1, as the source moves away from observer 3.
25. Doppler radar can not only detect the distance to a storm, but also the speed and direction at which the storm
      is traveling.

27. The speed of sound decreases as the temperature decreases. The Mach number is equal to  so the
