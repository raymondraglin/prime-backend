INTRODUCTION Our investigation of light revolves around two questions of fundamental importance: (1)
What is the nature of light, and (2) how does light behave under various circumstances? Answers to these
questions can be found in Maxwell's equations (in Electromagnetic Waves), which predict the existence of
electromagnetic waves and their behavior. Examples of light include radio and infrared waves, visible light,
ultraviolet radiation, and X-rays. Interestingly, not all light phenomena can be explained by Maxwell's theory.
6  1 · The Nature of Light

   Experiments performed early in the twentieth century showed that light has corpuscular, or particle-like,
   properties. The idea that light can display both wave and particle characteristics is called wave-particle
   duality, which is examined in Photons and Matter Waves.

   In this chapter, we study the basic properties of light. In the next few chapters, we investigate the behavior of
   light when it interacts with optical devices such as mirrors, lenses, and apertures.

   1.1 The Propagation of Light

   Learning Objectives
   By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Determine the index of refraction, given the speed of light in a medium
    · List the ways in which light travels from a source to another location

   The speed of light in a vacuum c is one of the fundamental constants of physics. As you will see when you reach
   Relativity, it is a central concept in Einstein's theory of relativity. As the accuracy of the measurements of the
   speed of light improved, it was found that different observers, even those moving at large velocities with
   respect to each other, measure the same value for the speed of light. However, the speed of light does vary in a
   precise manner with the material it traverses. These facts have far-reaching implications, as we will see in
   later chapters.

   The Speed of Light: Early Measurements

   The first measurement of the speed of light was made by the Danish astronomer Ole Roemer (1644-1710) in
   1675. He studied the orbit of Io, one of the four large moons of Jupiter, and found that it had a period of
   revolution of 42.5 h around Jupiter. He also discovered that this value fluctuated by a few seconds, depending
   on the position of Earth in its orbit around the Sun. Roemer realized that this fluctuation was due to the finite
   speed of light and could be used to determine c.

   Roemer found the period of revolution of Io by measuring the time interval between successive eclipses by

   Jupiter. Figure 1.2(a) shows the planetary configurations when such a measurement is made from Earth in the

   part of its orbit where it is receding from Jupiter. When Earth is at point A, Earth, Jupiter, and Io are aligned.

   The next time this alignment occurs, Earth is at point B, and the light carrying that information to Earth must

   travel to that point. Since B is farther from Jupiter than A, light takes more time to reach Earth when Earth is at

   B. Now imagine it is about 6 months later, and the planets are arranged as in part (b) of the figure. The

   measurement of Io's period begins with Earth at point and Io eclipsed by Jupiter. The next eclipse then

   occurs when Earth is at point , to which the light carrying the information of this eclipse must travel. Since

   is closer to Jupiter than , light takes less time to reach Earth when it is at . This time interval between

   the successive eclipses of Io seen at and is therefore less than the time interval between the eclipses seen

   at A and B. By measuring the difference in these time intervals and with appropriate knowledge of the distance

   between Jupiter and Earth, Roemer calculated that the speed of light was  which is 33% below

   the value accepted today.

   Figure 1.2 Roemer's astronomical method for determining the speed of light. Measurements of Io's period done with the configurations
   of parts (a) and (b) differ, because the light path length and associated travel time increase from A to B (a) but decrease from to (b).

The first successful terrestrial measurement of the speed of light was made by Armand Fizeau (1819-1896) in

1849. He placed a toothed wheel that could be rotated very rapidly on one hilltop and a mirror on a second

hilltop 8 km away (Figure 1.3). An intense light source was placed behind the wheel, so that when the wheel

rotated, it chopped the light beam into a succession of pulses. The speed of the wheel was then adjusted until

no light returned to the observer located behind the wheel. This could only happen if the wheel rotated

through an angle corresponding to a displacement of      teeth, while the pulses traveled down to the

mirror and back. Knowing the rotational speed of the wheel, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the

distance to the mirror, Fizeau determined the speed of light to be  which is only 5% too high.

Figure 1.3 Fizeau's method for measuring the speed of light. The teeth of the wheel block the reflected light upon return when the wheel
is rotated at a rate that matches the light travel time to and from the mirror.

The French physicist Jean Bernard Léon Foucault (1819-1868) modified Fizeau's apparatus by replacing the

toothed wheel with a rotating mirror. In 1862, he measured the speed of light to be                  which is

within 0.6% of the presently accepted value. Albert Michelson (1852-1931) also used Foucault's method on

several occasions to measure the speed of light. His first experiments were performed in 1878; by 1926, he

had refined the technique so well that he found c to be

Today, the speed of light is known to great precision. In fact, the speed of light in a vacuum c is so important
that it is accepted as one of the basic physical quantities and has the value

                                                                                                            1.1

where the approximate value of                 is used whenever three-digit accuracy is sufficient.

Speed of Light in Matter

The speed of light through matter is less than it is in a vacuum, because light interacts with atoms in a
material. The speed of light depends strongly on the type of material, since its interaction varies with different
atoms, crystal lattices, and other substructures. We can define a constant of a material that describes the speed
of light in it, called the index of refraction n:

                                                                                                            1.2

where v is the observed speed of light in the material.

Since the speed of light is always less than c in matter and equals c only in a vacuum, the index of refraction is

always greater than or equal to one; that is,  . Table 1.1 gives the indices of refraction for some

representative substances. The values are listed for a particular wavelength of light, because they vary slightly

with wavelength. (This can have important effects, such as colors separated by a prism, as we will see in
8  1 · The Nature of Light

   Dispersion.) Note that for gases, n is close to 1.0. This seems reasonable, since atoms in gases are widely

   separated, and light travels at c in the vacuum between atoms. It is common to take  for gases unless

   great precision is needed. Although the speed of light v in a medium varies considerably from its value c in a

   vacuum, it is still a large speed.

Speed of Light in Jewelry

Calculate the speed of light in zircon, a material used in jewelry to imitate diamond.

Strategy
We can calculate the speed of light in a material v from the index of refraction n of the material, using the
equation

Solution                  for v gives us
Rearranging the equation

The index of refraction for zircon is given as 1.923 in Table 1.1, and c is given in Equation 1.1. Entering these
values in the equation gives

Significance
This speed is slightly larger than half the speed of light in a vacuum and is still high compared with speeds we
normally experience. The only substance listed in Table 1.1 that has a greater index of refraction than zircon is
diamond. We shall see later that the large index of refraction for zircon makes it sparkle more than glass, but
less than diamond.

Table 1.1 shows that ethanol and fresh water have very similar indices of refraction. By what percentage do the
speeds of light in these liquids differ?

The Ray Model of Light

You have already studied some of the wave characteristics of light in the previous chapter on Electromagnetic
Waves. In this chapter, we start mainly with the ray characteristics. There are three ways in which light can
travel from a source to another location (Figure 1.4). It can come directly from the source through empty space,
such as from the Sun to Earth. Or light can travel through various media, such as air and glass, to the observer.
Light can also arrive after being reflected, such as by a mirror. In all of these cases, we can model the path of
light as a straight line called a ray.
10  1 · The Nature of Light

    Figure 1.4 Three methods for light to travel from a source to another location. (a) Light reaches the upper atmosphere of Earth, traveling
    through empty space directly from the source. (b) Light can reach a person by traveling through media like air and glass. (c) Light can also
    reflect from an object like a mirror. In the situations shown here, light interacts with objects large enough that it travels in straight lines, like
    a ray.

    Experiments show that when light interacts with an object several times larger than its wavelength, it travels in
    straight lines and acts like a ray. Its wave characteristics are not pronounced in such situations. Since the
    wavelength of visible light is less than a micron (a thousandth of a millimeter), it acts like a ray in the many
    common situations in which it encounters objects larger than a micron. For example, when visible light
    encounters anything large enough that we can observe it with unaided eyes, such as a coin, it acts like a ray,
    with generally negligible wave characteristics.

    In all of these cases, we can model the path of light as straight lines. Light may change direction when it
    encounters objects (such as a mirror) or in passing from one material to another (such as in passing from air to
    glass), but it then continues in a straight line or as a ray. The word "ray" comes from mathematics and here
    means a straight line that originates at some point. It is acceptable to visualize light rays as laser rays. The ray
    model of light describes the path of light as straight lines.

    Since light moves in straight lines, changing directions when it interacts with materials, its path is described
    by geometry and simple trigonometry. This part of optics, where the ray aspect of light dominates, is therefore
    called geometric optics. Two laws govern how light changes direction when it interacts with matter. These are
    the law of reflection, for situations in which light bounces off matter, and the law of refraction, for situations in
    which light passes through matter. We will examine more about each of these laws in upcoming sections of this
    chapter.

    1.2 The Law of Reflection

    Learning Objectives
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     · Explain the reflection of light from polished and rough surfaces
     · Describe the principle and applications of corner reflectors

    Whenever we look into a mirror, or squint at sunlight glinting from a lake, we are seeing a reflection. When you
    look at a piece of white paper, you are seeing light scattered from it. Large telescopes use reflection to form an
    image of stars and other astronomical objects.

    The law of reflection states that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence, or

                                                                                                                                                           1.3

    The law of reflection is illustrated in Figure 1.5, which also shows how the angle of incidence and angle of

Figure 1.5 The law of reflection states that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence--  The angles are measured
relative to the perpendicular to the surface at the point where the ray strikes the surface.

We expect to see reflections from smooth surfaces, but Figure 1.6 illustrates how a rough surface reflects light.
Since the light strikes different parts of the surface at different angles, it is reflected in many different
directions, or diffused. Diffused light is what allows us to see a sheet of paper from any angle, as shown in
Figure 1.7(a). People, clothing, leaves, and walls all have rough surfaces and can be seen from all sides. A
mirror, on the other hand, has a smooth surface (compared with the wavelength of light) and reflects light at
specific angles, as illustrated in Figure 1.7(b). When the Moon reflects from a lake, as shown in Figure 1.7(c), a
combination of these effects takes place.

Figure 1.6 Light is diffused when it reflects from a rough surface. Here, many parallel rays are incident, but they are reflected at many
different angles, because the surface is rough.

Figure 1.7 (a) When a sheet of paper is illuminated with many parallel incident rays, it can be seen at many different angles, because its
surface is rough and diffuses the light. (b) A mirror illuminated by many parallel rays reflects them in only one direction, because its surface
is very smooth. Only the observer at a particular angle sees the reflected light. (c) Moonlight is spread out when it is reflected by the lake,
because the surface is shiny but uneven. (credit c: modification of work by Diego Torres Silvestre)
12  1 · The Nature of Light

    When you see yourself in a mirror, it appears that the image is actually behind the mirror (Figure 1.8). We see
    the light coming from a direction determined by the law of reflection. The angles are such that the image is
    exactly the same distance behind the mirror as you stand in front of the mirror. If the mirror is on the wall of a
    room, the images in it are all behind the mirror, which can make the room seem bigger. Although these mirror
    images make objects appear to be where they cannot be (like behind a solid wall), the images are not figments
    of your imagination. Mirror images can be photographed and videotaped by instruments and look just as they
    do with our eyes (which are optical instruments themselves). The precise manner in which images are formed
    by mirrors and lenses is discussed in an upcoming chapter on Geometric Optics and Image Formation.

    Figure 1.8 (a) Your image in a mirror is behind the mirror. The two rays shown are those that strike the mirror at just the correct angles to
    be reflected into the eyes of the person. The image appears to be behind the mirror at the same distance away as (b) if you were looking at
    your twin directly, with no mirror.

    Corner Reflectors (Retroreflectors)

    A light ray that strikes an object consisting of two mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces is reflected back
    exactly parallel to the direction from which it came (Figure 1.9). This is true whenever the reflecting surfaces
    are perpendicular, and it is independent of the angle of incidence. (For proof, see Exercise 1.34 at the end of
    this section.) Such an object is called a corner reflector, since the light bounces from its inside corner. Corner
    reflectors are a subclass of retroreflectors, which all reflect rays back in the directions from which they came.
    Although the geometry of the proof is much more complex, corner reflectors can also be built with three
    mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces and are useful in three-dimensional applications.

    Figure 1.9 A light ray that strikes two mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces is reflected back exactly parallel to the direction from
    which it came.

    Many inexpensive reflector buttons on bicycles, cars, and warning signs have corner reflectors designed to

return light in the direction from which it originated. Rather than simply reflecting light over a wide angle,
retroreflection ensures high visibility if the observer and the light source are located together, such as a car's
driver and headlights. The Apollo astronauts placed a true corner reflector on the Moon (Figure 1.10). Laser
signals from Earth can be bounced from that corner reflector to measure the gradually increasing distance to
the Moon of a few centimeters per year.

Figure 1.10 (a) Astronauts placed a corner reflector on the Moon to measure its gradually increasing orbital distance. (b) The bright spots
on these bicycle safety reflectors are reflections of the flash of the camera that took this picture on a dark night. (credit a: modification of
work by NASA; credit b: modification of work by "Julo"/Wikimedia Commons)

Working on the same principle as these optical reflectors, corner reflectors are routinely used as radar
reflectors (Figure 1.11) for radio-frequency applications. Under most circumstances, small boats made of
fiberglass or wood do not strongly reflect radio waves emitted by radar systems. To make these boats visible to
radar (to avoid collisions, for example), radar reflectors are attached to boats, usually in high places.

                   Figure 1.11 A radar reflector hoisted on a sailboat is a type of corner reflector. (credit: Tim Sheerman-Chase)

As a counterexample, if you are interested in building a stealth airplane, radar reflections should be minimized
to evade detection. One of the design considerations would then be to avoid building corners into the
airframe.

1.3 Refraction

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Describe how rays change direction upon entering a medium
 · Apply the law of refraction in problem solving
You may often notice some odd things when looking into a fish tank. For example, you may see the same fish
14  1 · The Nature of Light

    appearing to be in two different places (Figure 1.12). This happens because light coming from the fish to you

    changes direction when it leaves the tank, and in this case, it can travel two different paths to get to your eyes.

    The changing of a light ray's direction (loosely called bending) when it passes through substances of different

    refractive indices is called refraction and is related to changes in the speed of light,  . Refraction is

    responsible for a tremendous range of optical phenomena, from the action of lenses to data transmission

    through optical fibers.

    Figure 1.12 (a) Looking at the fish tank as shown, we can see the same fish in two different locations, because light changes directions
    when it passes from water to air. In this case, the light can reach the observer by two different paths, so the fish seems to be in two
    different places. This bending of light is called refraction and is responsible for many optical phenomena. (b) This image shows refraction of
    light from a fish near the top of a fish tank.

    Figure 1.13 shows how a ray of light changes direction when it passes from one medium to another. As before,
    the angles are measured relative to a perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray crosses it.
    (Some of the incident light is reflected from the surface, but for now we concentrate on the light that is
    transmitted.) The change in direction of the light ray depends on the relative values of the indices of refraction
    (The Propagation of Light) of the two media involved. In the situations shown, medium 2 has a greater index of
    refraction than medium 1. Note that as shown in Figure 1.13(a), the direction of the ray moves closer to the
    perpendicular when it progresses from a medium with a lower index of refraction to one with a higher index of
    refraction. Conversely, as shown in Figure 1.13(b), the direction of the ray moves away from the perpendicular
    when it progresses from a medium with a higher index of refraction to one with a lower index of refraction.
    The path is exactly reversible.

Figure 1.13 The change in direction of a light ray depends on how the index of refraction changes when it crosses from one medium to
another. In the situations shown here, the index of refraction is greater in medium 2 than in medium 1. (a) A ray of light moves closer to the
perpendicular when entering a medium with a higher index of refraction. (b) A ray of light moves away from the perpendicular when
entering a medium with a lower index of refraction.

The amount that a light ray changes its direction depends both on the incident angle and the amount that the
speed changes. For a ray at a given incident angle, a large change in speed causes a large change in direction
and thus a large change in angle. The exact mathematical relationship is the law of refraction, or Snell's law,
after the Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snell (1591-1626), who discovered it in 1621. While the law has
been named after Snell, the Arabian physicist Ibn Sahl found the law of refraction in 984 and used it in his
work On Burning Mirrors and Lenses. The law of refraction is stated in equation form as

                                                                                                                                                       1.4

Here and are the indices of refraction for media 1 and 2, and and are the angles between the rays
and the perpendicular in media 1 and 2. The incoming ray is called the incident ray, the outgoing ray is called
the refracted ray, and the associated angles are the incident angle and the refracted angle, respectively.

Snell's experiments showed that the law of refraction is obeyed and that a characteristic index of refraction n
could be assigned to a given medium and its value measured. Snell was not aware that the speed of light varied
in different media, a key fact used when we derive the law of refraction theoretically using Huygens's principle
in Huygens's Principle.

       EXAMPLE 1.2

Determining the Index of Refraction

Find the index of refraction for medium 2 in Figure 1.13(a), assuming medium 1 is air and given that the

incident angle is  and the angle of refraction is  .

Strategy

The index of refraction for air is taken to be 1 in most cases (and up to four significant figures, it is 1.000).

Thus,     here. From the given information,           and        With this information, the only

unknown in Snell's law is so we can use Snell's law to find it.

Solution
From Snell's law we have

    Entering known values,

    Significance
    This is the index of refraction for water, and Snell could have determined it by measuring the angles and
    performing this calculation. He would then have found 1.33 to be the appropriate index of refraction for water
    in all other situations, such as when a ray passes from water to glass. Today, we can verify that the index of
    refraction is related to the speed of light in a medium by measuring that speed directly.

         INTERACTIVE

    1.2. Also by measurement, confirm that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.

        EXAMPLE 1.3

    A Larger Change in Direction

    Suppose that in a situation like that in Example 1.2, light goes from air to diamond and that the incident angle

    is  . Calculate the angle of refraction in the diamond.

    Strategy                                                 , and we are given  . We can look up the

    Significance

    For the same       angle of incidence, the angle of refraction in diamond is significantly smaller than in water

        rather than          --see Example 1.2). This means there is a larger change in direction in diamond. The

    cause of a large change in direction is a large change in the index of refraction (or speed). In general, the larger

    the change in speed, the greater the effect on the direction of the ray.

1.4 Total Internal Reflection

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Explain the phenomenon of total internal reflection
 · Describe the workings and uses of optical fibers
 · Analyze the reason for the sparkle of diamonds

A good-quality mirror may reflect more than of the light that falls on it, absorbing the rest. But it would be
useful to have a mirror that reflects all of the light that falls on it. Interestingly, we can produce total reflection
using an aspect of refraction.

Consider what happens when a ray of light strikes the surface between two materials, as shown in Figure

1.14(a). Part of the light crosses the boundary and is refracted; the rest is reflected. If, as shown in the figure,

the index of refraction for the second medium is less than for the first, the ray bends away from the

perpendicular. (Since           the angle of refraction is greater than the angle of incidence--that is,

Now imagine what happens as the incident angle increases. This causes to increase also. The largest the

angle of refraction can be is , as shown in part (b). The critical angle for a combination of materials is

defined to be the incident angle that produces an angle of refraction of . That is, is the incident angle

for which  . If the incident angle is greater than the critical angle, as shown in Figure 1.14(c), then

all of the light is reflected back into medium 1, a condition called total internal reflection. (As the figure

shows, the reflected rays obey the law of reflection so that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of

incidence in all three cases.)

Figure 1.14 (a) A ray of light crosses a boundary where the index of refraction decreases. That is,          The ray bends away from the
perpendicular. (b) The critical angle is the angle of incidence for which the angle of refraction is  (c) Total internal reflection occurs
when the incident angle is greater than the critical angle.

Snell's law states the relationship between angles and indices of refraction. It is given by

When the incident angle equals the critical angle       , the angle of refraction is                      . Noting

that       Snell's law in this case becomes

The critical angle for a given combination of materials is thus

                                                                                                                                                       1.5

Total internal reflection occurs for any incident angle greater than the critical angle , and it can only occur
when the second medium has an index of refraction less than the first. Note that this equation is written for a
light ray that travels in medium 1 and reflects from medium 2, as shown in Figure 1.14.
18  1 · The Nature of Light

            EXAMPLE 1.4

    Determining a Critical Angle

    What is the critical angle for light traveling in a polystyrene (a type of plastic) pipe surrounded by air? The
    index of refraction for polystyrene is 1.49.

    Strategy
    The index of refraction of air can be taken to be 1.00, as before. Thus, the condition that the second medium
    (air) has an index of refraction less than the first (plastic) is satisfied, and we can use the equation

    to find the critical angle where          and

    Solution
    Substituting the identified values gives

    Significance

    This result means that any ray of light inside the plastic that strikes the surface at an angle greater than

    is totally reflected. This makes the inside surface of the clear plastic a perfect mirror for such rays, without any

    need for the silvering used on common mirrors. Different combinations of materials have different critical

    angles, but any combination with          can produce total internal reflection. The same calculation as made

    here shows that the critical angle for a ray going from water to air is  , whereas that from diamond to air is

    , and that from flint glass to crown glass is  .

         CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 1.3

    At the surface between air and water, light rays can go from air to water and from water to air. For which ray is
    there no possibility of total internal reflection?

    In the photo that opens this chapter, the image of a swimmer underwater is captured by a camera that is also
    underwater. The swimmer in the upper half of the photograph, apparently facing upward, is, in fact, a reflected
    image of the swimmer below. The circular ripple near the photograph's center is actually on the water surface.
    The undisturbed water surrounding it makes a good reflecting surface when viewed from below, thanks to total
    internal reflection. However, at the very top edge of this photograph, rays from below strike the surface with
    incident angles less than the critical angle, allowing the camera to capture a view of activities on the pool deck
    above water.

    Fiber Optics: Endoscopes to Telephones

    Fiber optics is one application of total internal reflection that is in wide use. In communications, it is used to
    transmit telephone, internet, and cable TV signals. Fiber optics employs the transmission of light down fibers
    of plastic or glass. Because the fibers are thin, light entering one is likely to strike the inside surface at an angle
    greater than the critical angle and, thus, be totally reflected (Figure 1.15). The index of refraction outside the
    fiber must be smaller than inside. In fact, most fibers have a varying refractive index to allow more light to be
    guided along the fiber through total internal refraction. Rays are reflected around corners as shown, making
    the fibers into tiny light pipes.

1.4 · Total Internal Reflection                                                                                                               19

Figure 1.15 Light entering a thin optic fiber may strike the inside surface at large or grazing angles and is completely reflected if these
angles exceed the critical angle. Such rays continue down the fiber, even following it around corners, since the angles of reflection and
incidence remain large.

Bundles of fibers can be used to transmit an image without a lens, as illustrated in Figure 1.16. The output of a
device called an endoscope is shown in Figure 1.16(b). Endoscopes are used to explore the interior of the body
through its natural orifices or minor incisions. Light is transmitted down one fiber bundle to illuminate
internal parts, and the reflected light is transmitted back out through another bundle to be observed.

Figure 1.16 (a) An image "A" is transmitted by a bundle of optical fibers. (b) An endoscope is used to probe the body, both transmitting
light to the interior and returning an image such as the one shown of a human epiglottis (a structure at the base of the tongue). (credit b:
modification of work by "Med_Chaos"/Wikimedia Commons)

Fiber optics has revolutionized surgical techniques and observations within the body, with a host of medical
diagnostic and therapeutic uses. Surgery can be performed, such as arthroscopic surgery on a knee or
shoulder joint, employing cutting tools attached to and observed with the endoscope. Samples can also be
obtained, such as by lassoing an intestinal polyp for external examination. The flexibility of the fiber optic
bundle allows doctors to navigate it around small and difficult-to-reach regions in the body, such as the
intestines, the heart, blood vessels, and joints. Transmission of an intense laser beam to burn away obstructing
plaques in major arteries, as well as delivering light to activate chemotherapy drugs, are becoming
20  1 · The Nature of Light

    commonplace. Optical fibers have in fact enabled microsurgery and remote surgery where the incisions are
    small and the surgeon's fingers do not need to touch the diseased tissue.

    Optical fibers in bundles are surrounded by a cladding material that has a lower index of refraction than the
    core (Figure 1.17). The cladding prevents light from being transmitted between fibers in a bundle. Without
    cladding, light could pass between fibers in contact, since their indices of refraction are identical. Since no
    light gets into the cladding (there is total internal reflection back into the core), none can be transmitted
    between clad fibers that are in contact with one another. Instead, the light is propagated along the length of the
    fiber, minimizing the loss of signal and ensuring that a quality image is formed at the other end. The cladding
    and an additional protective layer make optical fibers durable as well as flexible.

    Figure 1.17 Fibers in bundles are clad by a material that has a lower index of refraction than the core to ensure total internal reflection,
    even when fibers are in contact with one another.

    Special tiny lenses that can be attached to the ends of bundles of fibers have been designed and fabricated.
    Light emerging from a fiber bundle can be focused through such a lens, imaging a tiny spot. In some cases, the
    spot can be scanned, allowing quality imaging of a region inside the body. Special minute optical filters
    inserted at the end of the fiber bundle have the capacity to image the interior of organs located tens of microns
    below the surface without cutting the surface--an area known as nonintrusive diagnostics. This is particularly
    useful for determining the extent of cancers in the stomach and bowel.
    In another type of application, optical fibers are commonly used to carry signals for telephone conversations
    and internet communications. Extensive optical fiber cables have been placed on the ocean floor and
    underground to enable optical communications. Optical fiber communication systems offer several
    advantages over electrical (copper)-based systems, particularly for long distances. The fibers can be made so
    transparent that light can travel many kilometers before it becomes dim enough to require
    amplification--much superior to copper conductors. This property of optical fibers is called low loss. Lasers
    emit light with characteristics that allow far more conversations in one fiber than are possible with electric
    signals on a single conductor. This property of optical fibers is called high bandwidth. Optical signals in one
    fiber do not produce undesirable effects in other adjacent fibers. This property of optical fibers is called
    reduced crosstalk. We shall explore the unique characteristics of laser radiation in a later chapter.

    Corner Reflectors and Diamonds

    Corner reflectors (The Law of Reflection) are perfectly efficient when the conditions for total internal reflection
    are satisfied. With common materials, it is easy to obtain a critical angle that is less than One use of these
    perfect mirrors is in binoculars, as shown in Figure 1.18. Another use is in periscopes found in submarines.

Figure 1.18 These binoculars employ corner reflectors (prisms) with total internal reflection to get light to the observer's eyes.

Total internal reflection, coupled with a large index of refraction, explains why diamonds sparkle more than

other materials. The critical angle for a diamond-to-air surface is only  , so when light enters a diamond, it

has trouble getting back out (Figure 1.19). Although light freely enters the diamond, it can exit only if it makes

an angle less than  . Facets on diamonds are specifically intended to make this unlikely. Good diamonds

are very clear, so that the light makes many internal reflections and is concentrated before exiting--hence the

bright sparkle. (Zircon is a natural gemstone that has an exceptionally large index of refraction, but it is not as

large as diamond, so it is not as highly prized. Cubic zirconia is manufactured and has an even higher index of

refraction          , but it is still less than that of diamond.) The colors you see emerging from a clear diamond

are not due to the diamond's color, which is usually nearly colorless. The colors result from dispersion, which

we discuss in Dispersion. Colored diamonds get their color from structural defects of the crystal lattice and the

inclusion of minute quantities of graphite and other materials. The Argyle Mine in Western Australia produces

around 90% of the world's pink, red, champagne, and cognac diamonds, whereas around 50% of the world's

clear diamonds come from central and southern Africa.

Figure 1.19 Light cannot easily escape a diamond, because its critical angle with air is so small. Most reflections are total, and the facets
are placed so that light can exit only in particular ways--thus concentrating the light and making the diamond sparkle brightly.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     · Explain the cause of dispersion in a prism
     · Describe the effects of dispersion in producing rainbows
     · Summarize the advantages and disadvantages of dispersion

    Everyone enjoys the spectacle of a rainbow glimmering against a dark stormy sky. How does sunlight falling on
    clear drops of rain get broken into the rainbow of colors we see? The same process causes white light to be
    broken into colors by a clear glass prism or a diamond (Figure 1.20).

    Figure 1.20 The colors of the rainbow (a) and those produced by a prism (b) are identical. (credit a: modification of work by
    "Alfredo55"/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by NASA)

    We see about six colors in a rainbow--red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet; sometimes indigo is listed,
    too. These colors are associated with different wavelengths of light, as shown in Figure 1.21. When our eye
    receives pure-wavelength light, we tend to see only one of the six colors, depending on wavelength. The
    thousands of other hues we can sense in other situations are our eye's response to various mixtures of
    wavelengths. White light, in particular, is a fairly uniform mixture of all visible wavelengths. Sunlight,
    considered to be white, actually appears to be a bit yellow, because of its mixture of wavelengths, but it does
    contain all visible wavelengths. The sequence of colors in rainbows is the same sequence as the colors shown
    in the figure. This implies that white light is spread out in a rainbow according to wavelength. Dispersion is
    defined as the spreading of white light into its full spectrum of wavelengths. More technically, dispersion
    occurs whenever the propagation of light depends on wavelength.

    Figure 1.21 Even though rainbows are associated with six colors, the rainbow is a continuous distribution of colors according to
    wavelengths.

    Any type of wave can exhibit dispersion. For example, sound waves, all types of electromagnetic waves, and
    water waves can be dispersed according to wavelength. Dispersion may require special circumstances and can
    result in spectacular displays such as in the production of a rainbow. This is also true for sound, since all

Refraction is responsible for dispersion in rainbows and many other situations. The angle of refraction
depends on the index of refraction, as we know from Snell's law. We know that the index of refraction n
depends on the medium. But for a given medium, n also depends on wavelength (Table 1.2). Note that for a
given medium, n increases as wavelength decreases and is greatest for violet light. Thus, violet light is bent
more than red light, as shown for a prism in Figure 1.22(b). White light is dispersed into the same sequence of
wavelengths as seen in Figure 1.20 and Figure 1.21.

    Rainbows are produced by a combination of refraction and reflection. You may have noticed that you see a
    rainbow only when you look away from the Sun. Light enters a drop of water and is reflected from the back of
    the drop (Figure 1.23). The light is refracted both as it enters and as it leaves the drop. Since the index of
    refraction of water varies with wavelength, the light is dispersed, and a rainbow is observed (Figure 1.24(a)).

(No dispersion occurs at the back surface, because the law of reflection does not depend on wavelength.) The
actual rainbow of colors seen by an observer depends on the myriad rays being refracted and reflected toward
the observer's eyes from numerous drops of water. The effect is most spectacular when the background is
dark, as in stormy weather, but can also be observed in waterfalls and lawn sprinklers. The arc of a rainbow
comes from the need to be looking at a specific angle relative to the direction of the Sun, as illustrated in part
(b). If two reflections of light occur within the water drop, another "secondary" rainbow is produced. This rare
event produces an arc that lies above the primary rainbow arc, as in part (c), and produces colors in the
reverse order of the primary rainbow, with red at the lowest angle and violet at the largest angle.

both as it enters and as it leaves the drop.

Dispersion may produce beautiful rainbows, but it can cause problems in optical systems. White light used to
transmit messages in a fiber is dispersed, spreading out in time and eventually overlapping with other
messages. Since a laser produces a nearly pure wavelength, its light experiences little dispersion, an advantage
over white light for transmission of information. In contrast, dispersion of electromagnetic waves coming to us
from outer space can be used to determine the amount of matter they pass through.

    1.6 Huygens's Principle

     · Describe Huygens's principle

     · Use Huygens's principle to explain diffraction

    So far in this chapter, we have been discussing optical phenomena using the ray model of light. However, some
    phenomena require analysis and explanations based on the wave characteristics of light. This is particularly
    true when the wavelength is not negligible compared to the dimensions of an optical device, such as a slit in
    the case of diffraction. Huygens's principle is an indispensable tool for this analysis.

    Figure 1.25 shows how a transverse wave looks as viewed from above and from the side. A light wave can be
    imagined to propagate like this, although we do not actually see it wiggling through space. From above, we view
    the wave fronts (or wave crests) as if we were looking down on ocean waves. The side view would be a graph of
    the electric or magnetic field. The view from above is perhaps more useful in developing concepts about wave
    optics.

    Figure 1.25 A transverse wave, such as an electromagnetic light wave, as viewed from above and from the side. The direction of
    propagation is perpendicular to the wave fronts (or wave crests) and is represented by a ray.

    The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) developed a useful technique for determining in detail
    how and where waves propagate. Starting from some known position, Huygens's principle states that every
    point on a wave front is a source of wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the same speed as the
    wave itself. The new wave front is tangent to all of the wavelets.

    Figure 1.26 shows how Huygens's principle is applied. A wave front is the long edge that moves, for example,
    with the crest or the trough. Each point on the wave front emits a semicircular wave that moves at the
    propagation speed v. We can draw these wavelets at a time t later, so that they have moved a distance
    The new wave front is a plane tangent to the wavelets and is where we would expect the wave to be a time t
    later. Huygens's principle works for all types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, and light waves. It
    is useful not only in describing how light waves propagate but also in explaining the laws of reflection and
    refraction. In addition, we will see that Huygens's principle tells us how and where light rays interfere.

Figure 1.26 Huygens's principle applied to a straight wave front. Each point on the wave front emits a semicircular wavelet that moves a

distance  The new wave front is a line tangent to the wavelets.

Reflection

Figure 1.27 shows how a mirror reflects an incoming wave at an angle equal to the incident angle, verifying the
law of reflection. As the wave front strikes the mirror, wavelets are first emitted from the left part of the mirror
and then from the right. The wavelets closer to the left have had time to travel farther, producing a wave front
traveling in the direction shown.

Figure 1.27 Huygens's principle applied to a plane wave front striking a mirror. The wavelets shown were emitted as each point on the
wave front struck the mirror. The tangent to these wavelets shows that the new wave front has been reflected at an angle equal to the
incident angle. The direction of propagation is perpendicular to the wave front, as shown by the downward-pointing arrows.

Refraction

The law of refraction can be explained by applying Huygens's principle to a wave front passing from one
medium to another (Figure 1.28). Each wavelet in the figure was emitted when the wave front crossed the
interface between the media. Since the speed of light is smaller in the second medium, the waves do not travel
as far in a given time, and the new wave front changes direction as shown. This explains why a ray changes
direction to become closer to the perpendicular when light slows down. Snell's law can be derived from the
geometry in Figure 1.28 (Example 1.6).
28  1 · The Nature of Light

    Figure 1.28 Huygens's principle applied to a plane wave front traveling from one medium to another, where its speed is less. The ray
    bends toward the perpendicular, since the wavelets have a lower speed in the second medium.

Diffraction

What happens when a wave passes through an opening, such as light shining through an open door into a dark
room? For light, we observe a sharp shadow of the doorway on the floor of the room, and no visible light bends
around corners into other parts of the room. When sound passes through a door, we hear it everywhere in the
room and thus observe that sound spreads out when passing through such an opening (Figure 1.30). What is
the difference between the behavior of sound waves and light waves in this case? The answer is that light has
very short wavelengths and acts like a ray. Sound has wavelengths on the order of the size of the door and
bends around corners (for frequency of 1000 Hz,

about three times smaller than the width of the doorway).
30  1 · The Nature of Light

    Figure 1.30 (a) Light passing through a doorway makes a sharp outline on the floor. Since light's wavelength is very small compared with
    the size of the door, it acts like a ray. (b) Sound waves bend into all parts of the room, a wave effect, because their wavelength is similar to
    the size of the door.

    If we pass light through smaller openings such as slits, we can use Huygens's principle to see that light bends
    as sound does (Figure 1.31). The bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle is called
    diffraction. Diffraction is a wave characteristic and occurs for all types of waves. If diffraction is observed for
    some phenomenon, it is evidence that the phenomenon is a wave. Thus, the horizontal diffraction of the laser
    beam after it passes through the slits in Figure 1.31 is evidence that light is a wave. You will learn about
    diffraction in much more detail in the chapter on Diffraction.

    Figure 1.31 Huygens's principle applied to a plane wave front striking an opening. The edges of the wave front bend after passing through
    the opening, a process called diffraction. The amount of bending is more extreme for a small opening, consistent with the fact that wave
    characteristics are most noticeable for interactions with objects about the same size as the wavelength.

polarization. What is polarization? How is it produced? What are some of its uses? The answers to these
questions are related to the wave character of light.

water. Part (b) of this figure was taken with a polarizing filter and part (a) was not. As a result, the reflection of clouds and sky observed in

Malus's Law

Light is one type of electromagnetic (EM) wave. As noted in the previous chapter on Electromagnetic Waves,
EM waves are transverse waves consisting of varying electric and magnetic fields that oscillate perpendicular
to the direction of propagation (Figure 1.33). However, in general, there are no specific directions for the
oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields; they vibrate in any randomly oriented plane perpendicular to
the direction of propagation. Polarization is the attribute that a wave's oscillations do have a definite direction
relative to the direction of propagation of the wave. (This is not the same type of polarization as that discussed
for the separation of charges.) Waves having such a direction are said to be polarized. For an EM wave, we
define the direction of polarization to be the direction parallel to the electric field. Thus, we can think of the
electric field arrows as showing the direction of polarization, as in Figure 1.33.

Figure 1.33 An EM wave, such as light, is a transverse wave. The electric and magnetic          fields are perpendicular to the direction of
propagation. The direction of polarization of the wave is the direction of the electric field.

To examine this further, consider the transverse waves in the ropes shown in Figure 1.34. The oscillations in
one rope are in a vertical plane and are said to be vertically polarized. Those in the other rope are in a
horizontal plane and are horizontally polarized. If a vertical slit is placed on the first rope, the waves pass
through. However, a vertical slit blocks the horizontally polarized waves. For EM waves, the direction of the
electric field is analogous to the disturbances on the ropes.
32  1 · The Nature of Light

    Figure 1.34 The transverse oscillations in one rope (a) are in a vertical plane, and those in the other rope (b) are in a horizontal plane. The
    first is said to be vertically polarized, and the other is said to be horizontally polarized. Vertical slits pass vertically polarized waves and
    block horizontally polarized waves.

    The Sun and many other light sources produce waves that have the electric fields in random directions (Figure
    1.35(a)). Such light is said to be unpolarized, because it is composed of many waves with all possible
    directions of polarization. Polaroid materials--which were invented by the founder of the Polaroid Corporation,
    Edwin Land--act as a polarizing slit for light, allowing only polarization in one direction to pass through.
    Polarizing filters are composed of long molecules aligned in one direction. If we think of the molecules as
    many slits, analogous to those for the oscillating ropes, we can understand why only light with a specific
    polarization can get through. The axis of a polarizing filter is the direction along which the filter passes the
    electric field of an EM wave.

    Figure 1.35 The slender arrow represents a ray of unpolarized light. The bold arrows represent the direction of polarization of the
    individual waves composing the ray. (a) If the light is unpolarized, the arrows point in all directions. (b) A polarizing filter has a polarization
    axis that acts as a slit passing through electric fields parallel to its direction. The direction of polarization of an EM wave is defined to be the
    direction of its electric field.

    Figure 1.36 shows the effect of two polarizing filters on originally unpolarized light. The first filter polarizes the
    light along its axis. When the axes of the first and second filters are aligned (parallel), then all of the polarized
    light passed by the first filter is also passed by the second filter. If the second polarizing filter is rotated, only
    the component of the light parallel to the second filter's axis is passed. When the axes are perpendicular, no
    light is passed by the second filter.

Only the component of the EM wave parallel to the axis of a filter is passed. Let us call the angle between the

direction of polarization and the axis of a filter . If the electric field has an amplitude E, then the transmitted

part of the wave has an amplitude  (Figure 1.37). Since the intensity of a wave is proportional to its

amplitude squared, the intensity I of the transmitted wave is related to the incident wave by

    Polarization by Reflection

    By now, you can probably guess that polarizing sunglasses cut the glare in reflected light, because that light is
    polarized. You can check this for yourself by holding polarizing sunglasses in front of you and rotating them
    while looking at light reflected from water or glass. As you rotate the sunglasses, you will notice the light gets
    bright and dim, but not completely black. This implies the reflected light is partially polarized and cannot be
    completely blocked by a polarizing filter.

    Figure 1.38 illustrates what happens when unpolarized light is reflected from a surface. Vertically polarized
    light is preferentially refracted at the surface, so the reflected light is left more horizontally polarized. The
    reasons for this phenomenon are beyond the scope of this text, but a convenient mnemonic for remembering
    this is to imagine the polarization direction to be like an arrow. Vertical polarization is like an arrow
    perpendicular to the surface and is more likely to stick and not be reflected. Horizontal polarization is like an

reflected light than unpolarized light from other sources.

Figure 1.38 Polarization by reflection. Unpolarized light has equal amounts of vertical and horizontal polarization. After interaction with a
surface, the vertical components are preferentially absorbed or refracted, leaving the reflected light more horizontally polarized. This is akin
to arrows striking on their sides and bouncing off, whereas arrows striking on their tips go into the surface.

Since the part of the light that is not reflected is refracted, the amount of polarization depends on the indices of

known as Brewster's angle, named after the nineteenth-century Scottish physicist who discovered them.

    Significance

    Light reflected at these angles could be completely blocked by a good polarizing filter held with its axis vertical.
    Brewster's angle for water and air are similar to those for glass and air, so that sunglasses are equally effective
    for light reflected from either water or glass under similar circumstances. Light that is not reflected is
    refracted into these media. Therefore, at an incident angle equal to Brewster's angle, the refracted light is
    slightly polarized vertically. It is not completely polarized vertically, because only a small fraction of the
    incident light is reflected, so a significant amount of horizontally polarized light is refracted.

    What happens at Brewster's angle if the original incident light is already

    Atomic Explanation of Polarizing Filters

    Polarizing filters have a polarization axis that acts as a slit. This slit passes EM waves (often visible light) that
    have an electric field parallel to the axis. This is accomplished with long molecules aligned perpendicular to
    the axis, as shown in Figure 1.39.

    Figure 1.39 Long molecules are aligned perpendicular to the axis of a polarizing filter. In an EM wave, the component of the electric field
    perpendicular to these molecules passes through the filter, whereas the component parallel to the molecules is absorbed.

Figure 1.40 illustrates how the component of the electric field parallel to the long molecules is absorbed. An
EM wave is composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The electric field is strong compared with the
magnetic field and is more effective in exerting force on charges in the molecules. The most affected charged
particles are the electrons, since electron masses are small. If an electron is forced to oscillate, it can absorb
energy from the EM wave. This reduces the field in the wave and, hence, reduces its intensity. In long
molecules, electrons can more easily oscillate parallel to the molecule than in the perpendicular direction. The
electrons are bound to the molecule and are more restricted in their movement perpendicular to the molecule.
Thus, the electrons can absorb EM waves that have a component of their electric field parallel to the molecule.
The electrons are much less responsive to electric fields perpendicular to the molecule and allow these fields
to pass. Thus, the axis of the polarizing filter is perpendicular to the length of the molecule.

Figure 1.40 Diagram of an electron in a long molecule oscillating parallel to the molecule. The oscillation of the electron absorbs energy

and reduces the intensity of the component of the EM wave that is parallel to the molecule.

Polarization by Scattering

If you hold your polarizing sunglasses in front of you and rotate them while looking at blue sky, you will see the
sky get bright and dim. This is a clear indication that light scattered by air is partially polarized. Figure 1.41
helps illustrate how this happens. Since light is a transverse EM wave, it vibrates the electrons of air molecules
perpendicular to the direction that it is traveling. The electrons then radiate like small antennae. Since they
are oscillating perpendicular to the direction of the light ray, they produce EM radiation that is polarized
perpendicular to the direction of the ray. When viewing the light along a line perpendicular to the original ray,
as in the figure, there can be no polarization in the scattered light parallel to the original ray, because that
would require the original ray to be a longitudinal wave. Along other directions, a component of the other
polarization can be projected along the line of sight, and the scattered light is only partially polarized.
Furthermore, multiple scattering can bring light to your eyes from other directions and can contain different
polarizations.
38  1 · The Nature of Light

    Figure 1.41 Polarization by scattering. Unpolarized light scattering from air molecules shakes their electrons perpendicular to the
    direction of the original ray. The scattered light therefore has a polarization perpendicular to the original direction and none parallel to the
    original direction.

    Photographs of the sky can be darkened by polarizing filters, a trick used by many photographers to make
    clouds brighter by contrast. Scattering from other particles, such as smoke or dust, can also polarize light.
    Detecting polarization in scattered EM waves can be a useful analytical tool in determining the scattering
    source.
    A range of optical effects are used in sunglasses. Besides being polarizing, sunglasses may have colored
    pigments embedded in them, whereas others use either a nonreflective or reflective coating. A recent
    development is photochromic lenses, which darken in the sunlight and become clear indoors. Photochromic
    lenses are embedded with organic microcrystalline molecules that change their properties when exposed to
    UV in sunlight, but become clear in artificial lighting with no UV.

    Liquid Crystals and Other Polarization Effects in Materials

    Although you are undoubtedly aware of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) found in watches, calculators, computer
    screens, cellphones, flat screen televisions, and many other places, you may not be aware that they are based
    on polarization. Liquid crystals are so named because their molecules can be aligned even though they are in a
    liquid. Liquid crystals have the property that they can rotate the polarization of light passing through them by

        . Furthermore, this property can be turned off by the application of a voltage, as illustrated in Figure 1.42. It
    is possible to manipulate this characteristic quickly and in small, well-defined regions to create the contrast
    patterns we see in so many LCD devices.
    In flat screen LCD televisions, a large light is generated at the back of the TV. The light travels to the front
    screen through millions of tiny units called pixels (picture elements). One of these is shown in Figure 1.42(a)
    and (b). Each unit has three cells, with red, blue, or green filters, each controlled independently. When the
    voltage across a liquid crystal is switched off, the liquid crystal passes the light through the particular filter. We
    can vary the picture contrast by varying the strength of the voltage applied to the liquid crystal.

Figure 1.42 (a) Polarized light is rotated by a liquid crystal and then passed by a polarizing filter that has its axis perpendicular to the
direction of the original polarization. (b) When a voltage is applied to the liquid crystal, the polarized light is not rotated and is blocked by

Many crystals and solutions rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through them. Such substances are
said to be optically active. Examples include sugar water, insulin, and collagen (Figure 1.43). In addition to
depending on the type of substance, the amount and direction of rotation depend on several other factors.
Among these is the concentration of the substance, the distance the light travels through it, and the wavelength
of light. Optical activity is due to the asymmetrical shape of molecules in the substance, such as being helical.
Measurements of the rotation of polarized light passing through substances can thus be used to measure
concentrations, a standard technique for sugars. It can also give information on the shapes of molecules, such
as proteins, and factors that affect their shapes, such as temperature and pH.

Figure 1.43 Optical activity is the ability of some substances to rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through them. The rotation
is detected with a polarizing filter or analyzer.

Glass and plastic become optically active when stressed: the greater the stress, the greater the effect. Optical
stress analysis on complicated shapes can be performed by making plastic models of them and observing
them through crossed filters, as seen in Figure 1.44. It is apparent that the effect depends on wavelength as
40  1 · The Nature of Light

    well as stress. The wavelength dependence is sometimes also used for artistic purposes.

    Another interesting phenomenon associated with polarized light is the ability of some crystals to split an
    unpolarized beam of light into two polarized beams. This occurs because the crystal has one value for the
    index of refraction of polarized light but a different value for the index of refraction of light polarized in the
    perpendicular direction, so that each component has its own angle of refraction. Such crystals are said to be
    birefringent, and, when aligned properly, two perpendicularly polarized beams will emerge from the crystal
    (Figure 1.45). Birefringent crystals can be used to produce polarized beams from unpolarized light. Some
    birefringent materials preferentially absorb one of the polarizations. These materials are called dichroic and
    can produce polarization by this preferential absorption. This is fundamentally how polarizing filters and
    other polarizers work.

    Figure 1.45 Birefringent materials, such as the common mineral calcite, split unpolarized beams of light into two with two different values
    of index of refraction.

INTRODUCTION This chapter introduces the major ideas of geometric optics, which describe the formation
52  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    of images due to reflection and refraction. It is called "geometric" optics because the images can be
    characterized using geometric constructions, such as ray diagrams. We have seen that visible light is an
    electromagnetic wave; however, its wave nature becomes evident only when light interacts with objects with
    dimensions comparable to the wavelength (about 500 nm for visible light). Therefore, the laws of geometric
    optics only apply to light interacting with objects much larger than the wavelength of the light.

    2.1 Images Formed by Plane Mirrors

    Learning Objectives
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     · Describe how an image is formed by a plane mirror.
     · Distinguish between real and virtual images.
     · Find the location and characterize the orientation of an image created by a plane mirror.

    You only have to look as far as the nearest bathroom to find an example of an image formed by a mirror. Images
    in a plane mirror are the same size as the object, are located behind the mirror, and are oriented in the same
    direction as the object (i.e., "upright").

    To understand how this happens, consider Figure 2.2. Two rays emerge from point P, strike the mirror, and
    reflect into the observer's eye. Note that we use the law of reflection to construct the reflected rays. If the
    reflected rays are extended backward behind the mirror (see dashed lines in Figure 2.2), they seem to
    originate from point Q. This is where the image of point P is located. If we repeat this process for point , we
    obtain its image at point . You should convince yourself by using basic geometry that the image height (the
    distance from Q to ) is the same as the object height (the distance from P to ). By forming images of all
    points of the object, we obtain an upright image of the object behind the mirror.

    Figure 2.2 Two light rays originating from point P on an object are reflected by a flat mirror into the eye of an observer. The reflected rays
    are obtained by using the law of reflection. Extending these reflected rays backward, they seem to come from point Q behind the mirror,
    which is where the virtual image is located. Repeating this process for point gives the image point . The image height is thus the same
    as the object height, the image is upright, and the object distance is the same as the image distance . (credit: modification of work by
    Kevin Dufendach)

    Notice that the reflected rays appear to the observer to come directly from the image behind the mirror. In
    reality, these rays come from the points on the mirror where they are reflected. The image behind the mirror is
    called a virtual image because it cannot be projected onto a screen--the rays only appear to originate from a
    common point behind the mirror. If you walk behind the mirror, you cannot see the image, because the rays do
    not go there. However, in front of the mirror, the rays behave exactly as if they come from behind the mirror, so
    that is where the virtual image is located.

2.1 · Images Formed by Plane Mirrors                                                                                                                        53

Later in this chapter, we discuss real images; a real image can be projected onto a screen because the rays
physically go through the image. You can certainly see both real and virtual images. The difference is that a
virtual image cannot be projected onto a screen, whereas a real image can.

Locating an Image in a Plane Mirror

The law of reflection tells us that the angle of incidence is the same as the angle of reflection. Applying this to
triangles PAB and QAB in Figure 2.2 and using basic geometry shows that they are congruent triangles. This
means that the distance PB from the object to the mirror is the same as the distance BQ from the mirror to the
image. The object distance (denoted ) is the distance from the mirror to the object (or, more generally, from
the center of the optical element that creates its image). Similarly, the image distance (denoted ) is the
distance from the mirror to the image (or, more generally, from the center of the optical element that creates
it). If we measure distances from the mirror, then the object and image are in opposite directions, so for a plane
mirror, the object and image distances should have the opposite signs:

                                                                                                                                                       2.1

An extended object such as the container in Figure 2.2 can be treated as a collection of points, and we can
apply the method above to locate the image of each point on the extended object, thus forming the extended
image.

Multiple Images

If an object is situated in front of two mirrors, you may see images in both mirrors. In addition, the image in the
first mirror may act as an object for the second mirror, so the second mirror may form an image of the image. If
the mirrors are placed parallel to each other and the object is placed at a point other than the midpoint
between them, then this process of image-of-an-image continues without end, as you may have noticed when
standing in a hallway with mirrors on each side. This is shown in Figure 2.3, which shows three images
produced by the blue object. Notice that each reflection reverses front and back, just like pulling a right-hand
glove inside out produces a left-hand glove (this is why a reflection of your right hand is a left hand). Thus, the
fronts and backs of images 1 and 2 are both inverted with respect to the object, and the front and back of image
3 is inverted with respect to image 2, which is the object for image 3.

Figure 2.3 Two parallel mirrors can produce, in theory, an infinite number of images of an object placed off center between the mirrors.
Three of these images are shown here. The front and back of each image is inverted with respect to its object. Note that the colors are only
to identify the images. For normal mirrors, the color of an image is essentially the same as that of its object.

You may have noticed that image 3 is smaller than the object, whereas images 1 and 2 are the same size as the
object. The ratio of the image height with respect to the object height is called magnification. More will be said
about magnification in the next section.

Infinite reflections may terminate. For instance, two mirrors at right angles form three images, as shown in
part (a) of Figure 2.4. Images 1 and 2 result from rays that reflect from only a single mirror, but image 1,2 is
formed by rays that reflect from both mirrors. This is shown in the ray-tracing diagram in part (b) of Figure 2.4.
To find image 1,2, you have to look behind the corner of the two mirrors.
54  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    Figure 2.4 Two mirrors can produce multiple images. (a) Three images of a plastic head are visible in the two mirrors at a right angle. (b) A
    single object reflecting from two mirrors at a right angle can produce three images, as shown by the green, purple, and red images.

    2.2 Spherical Mirrors

    Learning Objectives
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     · Describe image formation by spherical mirrors.
     · Use ray diagrams and the mirror equation to calculate the properties of an image in a spherical mirror.
    The image in a plane mirror has the same size as the object, is upright, and is the same distance behind the
    mirror as the object is in front of the mirror. A curved mirror, on the other hand, can form images that may be
    larger or smaller than the object and may form either in front of the mirror or behind it. In general, any curved
    surface will form an image, although some images make be so distorted as to be unrecognizable (think of fun
    house mirrors).
    Because curved mirrors can create such a rich variety of images, they are used in many optical devices that
    find many uses. We will concentrate on spherical mirrors for the most part, because they are easier to
    manufacture than mirrors such as parabolic mirrors and so are more common.

    Curved Mirrors

    We can define two general types of spherical mirrors. If the reflecting surface is the outer side of the sphere,
    the mirror is called a convex mirror. If the inside surface is the reflecting surface, it is called a concave
    mirror.
    Symmetry is one of the major hallmarks of many optical devices, including mirrors and lenses. The symmetry
    axis of such optical elements is often called the principal axis or optical axis. For a spherical mirror, the optical
    axis passes through the mirror's center of curvature and the mirror's vertex, as shown in Figure 2.5.

Figure 2.5 A spherical mirror is formed by cutting out a piece of a sphere and silvering either the inside or outside surface. A concave
mirror has silvering on the interior surface (think "cave"), and a convex mirror has silvering on the exterior surface.

Consider rays that are parallel to the optical axis of a parabolic mirror, as shown in part (a) of Figure 2.6.
Following the law of reflection, these rays are reflected so that they converge at a point, called the focal point.
Part (b) of this figure shows a spherical mirror that is large compared with its radius of curvature. For this
mirror, the reflected rays do not cross at the same point, so the mirror does not have a well-defined focal point.
This is called spherical aberration and results in a blurred image of an extended object. Part (c) shows a
spherical mirror that is small compared to its radius of curvature. This mirror is a good approximation of a
parabolic mirror, so rays that arrive parallel to the optical axis are reflected to a well-defined focal point. The
distance along the optical axis from the mirror to the focal point is called the focal length of the mirror.

Figure 2.6 (a) Parallel rays reflected from a parabolic mirror cross at a single point called the focal point F. (b) Parallel rays reflected from
a large spherical mirror do not cross at a common point. (c) If a spherical mirror is small compared with its radius of curvature, it better
approximates the central part of a parabolic mirror, so parallel rays essentially cross at a common point. The distance along the optical axis
from the mirror to the focal point is the focal length f of the mirror.

A convex spherical mirror also has a focal point, as shown in Figure 2.7. Incident rays parallel to the optical
axis are reflected from the mirror and seem to originate from point F at focal length f behind the mirror. Thus,
the focal point is virtual because no real rays actually pass through it; they only appear to originate from it.

    spherical mirror and seem to originate from a well-defined focal point at focal distance f on the opposite side of the mirror. The focal point is
    virtual because no real rays pass through it. (b) Photograph of a virtual image formed by a convex mirror. (credit b: modification of work by
    Jenny Downing)

    How does the focal length of a mirror relate to the mirror's radius of curvature? Figure 2.8 shows a single ray

    that is reflected by a spherical concave mirror. The incident ray is parallel to the optical axis. The point at

    which the reflected ray crosses the optical axis is the focal point. Note that all incident rays that are parallel to

    the optical axis are reflected through the focal point--we only show one ray for simplicity. We want to find how

    the focal length FP (denoted by f) relates to the radius of curvature of the mirror, R, whose length is

                   . The law of reflection tells us that angles OXC and CXF are the same, and because the incident

    ray is parallel to the optical axis, angles OXC and XCP are also the same. Thus, triangle CXF is an isosceles

    triangle with          . If the angle is small (so that  ; this is called the "small-angle

    approximation"), then  or                 . Inserting this into the equation for the radius R, we get

    Figure 2.8 Reflection in a concave mirror. In the small-angle approximation, a ray that is parallel to the optical axis CP is reflected through
    the focal point F of the mirror.

    In other words, in the small-angle approximation, the focal length f of a concave spherical mirror is half of its
    radius of curvature, R:

                                                                                                                                                           2.2

In this chapter, we assume that the small-angle approximation (also called the paraxial approximation) is

always valid. In this approximation, all rays are paraxial rays, which means that they make a small angle with

the optical axis and are at a distance much less than the radius of curvature from the optical axis. In this case,

their angles of reflection are small angles, so  .

Using Ray Tracing to Locate Images

To find the location of an image formed by a spherical mirror, we first use ray tracing, which is the technique of
drawing rays and using the law of reflection to determine the reflected rays (later, for lenses, we use the law of
refraction to determine refracted rays). Combined with some basic geometry, we can use ray tracing to find the
focal point, the image location, and other information about how a mirror manipulates light. In fact, we already
used ray tracing above to locate the focal point of spherical mirrors, or the image distance of flat mirrors. To
locate the image of an object, you must locate at least two points of the image. Locating each point requires
drawing at least two rays from a point on the object and constructing their reflected rays. The point at which
the reflected rays intersect, either in real space or in virtual space, is where the corresponding point of the
image is located. To make ray tracing easier, we concentrate on four "principal" rays whose reflections are easy
to construct.

Figure 2.9 shows a concave mirror and a convex mirror, each with an arrow-shaped object in front of it. These
are the objects whose images we want to locate by ray tracing. To do so, we draw rays from point Q that is on
the object but not on the optical axis. We choose to draw our ray from the tip of the object. Principal ray 1 goes
from point Q and travels parallel to the optical axis. The reflection of this ray must pass through the focal point,
as discussed above. Thus, for the concave mirror, the reflection of principal ray 1 goes through focal point F, as
shown in part (b) of the figure. For the convex mirror, the backward extension of the reflection of principal ray
1 goes through the focal point (i.e., a virtual focus). Principal ray 2 travels first on the line going through the
focal point and then is reflected back along a line parallel to the optical axis. Principal ray 3 travels toward the
center of curvature of the mirror, so it strikes the mirror at normal incidence and is reflected back along the
line from which it came. Finally, principal ray 4 strikes the vertex of the mirror and is reflected symmetrically
about the optical axis.
58  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    Figure 2.9 The four principal rays shown for both (a) a concave mirror and (b) a convex mirror. The image forms where the rays intersect
    (for real images) or where their backward extensions intersect (for virtual images).

    The four principal rays intersect at point , which is where the image of point Q is located. To locate point ,
    drawing any two of these principle rays would suffice. We are thus free to choose whichever of the principal
    rays we desire to locate the image. Drawing more than two principal rays is sometimes useful to verify that the
    ray tracing is correct.

    To completely locate the extended image, we need to locate a second point in the image, so that we know how
    the image is oriented. To do this, we trace the principal rays from the base of the object. In this case, all four
    principal rays run along the optical axis, reflect from the mirror, and then run back along the optical axis. The
    difficulty is that, because these rays are collinear, we cannot determine a unique point where they intersect. All
    we know is that the base of the image is on the optical axis. However, because the mirror is symmetrical from
    top to bottom, it does not change the vertical orientation of the object. Thus, because the object is vertical, the
    image must be vertical. Therefore, the image of the base of the object is on the optical axis directly above the
    image of the tip, as drawn in the figure.

    For the concave mirror, the extended image in this case forms between the focal point and the center of
    curvature of the mirror. It is inverted with respect to the object, is a real image, and is smaller than the object.
    Were we to move the object closer to or farther from the mirror, the characteristics of the image would change.
    For example, we show, as a later exercise, that an object placed between a concave mirror and its focal point
    leads to a virtual image that is upright and larger than the object. For the convex mirror, the extended image
    forms between the focal point and the mirror. It is upright with respect to the object, is a virtual image, and is
    smaller than the object.

Summary of Ray-Tracing Rules

Ray tracing is very useful for mirrors. The rules for ray tracing are summarized here for reference:

· A ray travelling parallel to the optical axis of a spherical mirror is reflected along a line that goes through
   the focal point of the mirror (ray 1 in Figure 2.9).

· A ray travelling along a line that goes through the focal point of a spherical mirror is reflected along a line
   parallel to the optical axis of the mirror (ray 2 in Figure 2.9).

· A ray travelling along a line that goes through the center of curvature of a spherical mirror is reflected
   back along the same line (ray 3 in Figure 2.9).

· A ray that strikes the vertex of a spherical mirror is reflected symmetrically about the optical axis of the
   mirror (ray 4 in Figure 2.9).

We use ray tracing to illustrate how images are formed by mirrors and to obtain numerical information about
optical properties of the mirror. If we assume that a mirror is small compared with its radius of curvature, we
can also use algebra and geometry to derive a mirror equation, which we do in the next section. Combining ray
tracing with the mirror equation is a good way to analyze mirror systems.

Image Formation by Reflection--The Mirror Equation

For a plane mirror, we showed that the image formed has the same height and orientation as the object, and it
is located at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror. Although the situation
is a bit more complicated for curved mirrors, using geometry leads to simple formulas relating the object and
image distances to the focal lengths of concave and convex mirrors.

Consider the object OP shown in Figure 2.10. The center of curvature of the mirror is labeled C and is a

distance R from the vertex of the mirror, as marked in the figure. The object and image distances are labeled

and , and the object and image heights are labeled and , respectively. Because the angles and are

alternate interior angles, we know that they have the same magnitude. However, they must differ in sign if we

measure angles from the optical axis, so  . An analogous scenario holds for the angles and . The law

of reflection tells us that they have the same magnitude, but their signs must differ if we measure angles from

the optical axis. Thus,  . Taking the tangent of the angles and , and using the property that

, gives us

                                                                                                            2.3

Similarly, taking the tangent of and gives
60  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    Combining these two results gives

    After a little algebra, this becomes

                                                                                                                                                           2.4

    No approximation is required for this result, so it is exact. However, as discussed above, in the small-angle
    approximation, the focal length of a spherical mirror is one-half the radius of curvature of the mirror, or

               . Inserting this into Equation 2.3 gives the mirror equation:

                                                                                                                                                           2.5

    The mirror equation relates the image and object distances to the focal distance and is valid only in the small-
    angle approximation. Although it was derived for a concave mirror, it also holds for convex mirrors (proving
    this is left as an exercise). We can extend the mirror equation to the case of a plane mirror by noting that a
    plane mirror has an infinite radius of curvature. This means the focal point is at infinity, so the mirror
    equation simplifies to

                                                                                                                                                           2.6
    which is the same as Equation 2.1 obtained earlier.

    Notice that we have been very careful with the signs in deriving the mirror equation. For a plane mirror, the
    image distance has the opposite sign of the object distance. Also, the real image formed by the concave mirror
    in Figure 2.10 is on the opposite side of the optical axis with respect to the object. In this case, the image height
    should have the opposite sign of the object height. To keep track of the signs of the various quantities in the
    mirror equation, we now introduce a sign convention.

    Sign convention for spherical mirrors

    Using a consistent sign convention is very important in geometric optics. It assigns positive or negative values
    for the quantities that characterize an optical system. Understanding the sign convention allows you to
    describe an image without constructing a ray diagram. This text uses the following sign convention:

    1. The focal length f is positive for concave mirrors and negative for convex mirrors.
    2. The image distance is positive for real images and negative for virtual images.

    Notice that rule 1 means that the radius of curvature of a spherical mirror can be positive or negative. What
    does it mean to have a negative radius of curvature? This means simply that the radius of curvature for a
    convex mirror is defined to be negative.

    Image magnification

    Let's use the sign convention to further interpret the derivation of the mirror equation. In deriving this
    equation, we found that the object and image heights are related by

                                                                                                                                                           2.7

    See Equation 2.3. Both the object and the image formed by the mirror in Figure 2.10 are real, so the object and
    image distances are both positive. The highest point of the object is above the optical axis, so the object height
    is positive. The image, however, is below the optical axis, so the image height is negative. Thus, this sign
    convention is consistent with our derivation of the mirror equation.

    Equation 2.7 in fact describes the linear magnification (often simply called "magnification") of the image in
    terms of the object and image distances. We thus define the dimensionless magnification m as follows:

                                                                                            2.2 · Spherical Mirrors                    61

                                                                                                                   2.8

If m is positive, the image is upright, and if m is negative, the image is inverted. If     , the image is larger

than the object, and if  , the image is smaller than the object. With this definition of magnification, we

get the following relation between the vertical and horizontal object and image distances:

                                                                                                                   2.9

This is a very useful relation because it lets you obtain the magnification of the image from the object and
image distances, which you can obtain from the mirror equation.

        EXAMPLE 2.1

Solar Electric Generating System

One of the solar technologies used today for generating electricity involves a device (called a parabolic trough
or concentrating collector) that concentrates sunlight onto a blackened pipe that contains a fluid. This heated
fluid is pumped to a heat exchanger, where the thermal energy is transferred to another system that is used to
generate steam and eventually generates electricity through a conventional steam cycle. Figure 2.11 shows
such a working system in southern California. The real mirror is a parabolic cylinder with its focus located at
the pipe; however, we can approximate the mirror as exactly one-quarter of a circular cylinder.

a. If we want the rays from the sun to focus at 40.0 cm from the mirror, what is the radius of the mirror?

b. What is the amount of sunlight concentrated onto the pipe, per meter of pipe length, assuming the

insolation (incident solar radiation) is 900  ?

c. If the fluid-carrying pipe has a 2.00-cm diameter, what is the temperature increase of the fluid per meter

the pipe, and that the fluid is mineral oil.

Strategy
First identify the physical principles involved. Part (a) is related to the optics of spherical mirrors. Part (b)
involves a little math, primarily geometry. Part (c) requires an understanding of heat and density.

Solution

a. The sun is the object, so the object distance is essentially infinity:  . The desired image distance is

          . We use the mirror equation to find the focal length of the mirror:
62  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    Thus, the radius of the mirror is                      .

    b. The insolation is 900          . You must find the cross-sectional area A of the concave mirror, since the

    power delivered is 900                    . The mirror in this case is estimated as a quarter-section of a cylinder,

    so the area for a length L of the mirror is               . The area for a length of 1.00 m is then

    Therefore, the increase in temperature in one minute is

    Significance

    An array of such pipes in the California desert can provide a thermal output of 250 MW on a sunny day, with

    fluids reaching temperatures as high as      . We are considering only one meter of pipe here and ignoring

    heat losses along the pipe.

    EXAMPLE 2.2

    Image in a Convex Mirror

    A keratometer is a device used to measure the curvature of the cornea of the eye, particularly for fitting contact
    lenses. Light is reflected from the cornea, which acts like a convex mirror, and the keratometer measures the
    magnification of the image. The smaller the magnification, the smaller the radius of curvature of the cornea. If
    the light source is 12 cm from the cornea and the image magnification is 0.032, what is the radius of curvature
    of the cornea?

    Strategy

    If you find the focal length of the convex mirror formed by the cornea, then you know its radius of curvature

    (it's twice the focal length). The object distance is     and the magnification is  . First find the

    image distance and then solve for the focal length f.

    Solution                                               . Solving for and inserting the given values yields

where we retained an extra significant figure because this is an intermediate step in the calculation. Solve the
mirror equation for the focal length f and insert the known values for the object and image distances. The
result is

The radius of curvature is twice the focal length, so

Significance
The focal length is negative, so the focus is virtual, as expected for a concave mirror and a real object. The
radius of curvature found here is reasonable for a cornea. The distance from cornea to retina in an adult eye is
about 2.0 cm. In practice, corneas may not be spherical, which complicates the job of fitting contact lenses.
Note that the image distance here is negative, consistent with the fact that the image is behind the mirror.
Thus, the image is virtual because no rays actually pass through it. In the problems and exercises, you will
show that, for a fixed object distance, a smaller radius of curvature corresponds to a smaller the magnification.

        PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

Spherical Mirrors

Step 1. First make sure that image formation by a spherical mirror is involved.
Step 2. Determine whether ray tracing, the mirror equation, or both are required. A sketch is very useful even
if ray tracing is not specifically required by the problem. Write symbols and known values on the sketch.
Step 3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns).
Step 4. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).
Step 5. If ray tracing is required, use the ray-tracing rules listed near the beginning of this section.
Step 6. Most quantitative problems require using the mirror equation. Use the examples as guides for using the
mirror equation.
Step 7. Check to see whether the answer makes sense. Do the signs of object distance, image distance, and
focal length correspond with what is expected from ray tracing? Is the sign of the magnification correct? Are
the object and image distances reasonable?

Departure from the Small-Angle Approximation

The small-angle approximation is a cornerstone of the above discussion of image formation by a spherical
mirror. When this approximation is violated, then the image created by a spherical mirror becomes distorted.
Such distortion is called aberration. Here we briefly discuss two specific types of aberrations: spherical
aberration and coma.

Spherical aberration

Consider a broad beam of parallel rays impinging on a spherical mirror, as shown in Figure 2.12.
64  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    Figure 2.12 (a) With spherical aberration, the rays that are farther from the optical axis and the rays that are closer to the optical axis are
    focused at different points. Notice that the aberration gets worse for rays farther from the optical axis. (b) For comatic aberration, parallel
    rays that are not parallel to the optical axis are focused at different heights and at different focal lengths, so the image contains a "tail" like
    a comet (which is "coma" in Latin). Note that the colored rays are only to facilitate viewing; the colors do not indicate the color of the light.

    The farther from the optical axis the rays strike, the worse the spherical mirror approximates a parabolic
    mirror. Thus, these rays are not focused at the same point as rays that are near the optical axis, as shown in the
    figure. Because of spherical aberration, the image of an extended object in a spherical mirror will be blurred.
    Spherical aberrations are characteristic of the mirrors and lenses that we consider in the following section of
    this chapter (more sophisticated mirrors and lenses are needed to eliminate spherical aberrations).

    Coma or comatic aberration

    Coma is similar to spherical aberration, but arises when the incoming rays are not parallel to the optical axis,
    as shown in part (b) of Figure 2.12. Recall that the small-angle approximation holds for spherical mirrors that
    are small compared to their radius. In this case, spherical mirrors are good approximations of parabolic
    mirrors. Parabolic mirrors focus all rays that are parallel to the optical axis at the focal point. However, parallel
    rays that are not parallel to the optical axis are focused at different heights and at different focal lengths, as
    show in part (b) of Figure 2.12. Because a spherical mirror is symmetric about the optical axis, the various
    colored rays in this figure create circles of the corresponding color on the focal plane.
    Although a spherical mirror is shown in part (b) of Figure 2.12, comatic aberration occurs also for parabolic
    mirrors--it does not result from a breakdown in the small-angle approximation. Spherical aberration, however,
    occurs only for spherical mirrors and is a result of a breakdown in the small-angle approximation. We will
    discuss both coma and spherical aberration later in this chapter, in connection with telescopes.

2.3 Images Formed by Refraction

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Describe image formation by a single refracting surface
 · Determine the location of an image and calculate its properties by using a ray diagram
 · Determine the location of an image and calculate its properties by using the equation for a single refracting

      surface

When rays of light propagate from one medium to another, these rays undergo refraction, which is when light
waves are bent at the interface between two media. The refracting surface can form an image in a similar

instead of the law of reflection.

Refraction at a Plane Interface--Apparent Depth

If you look at a straight rod partially submerged in water, it appears to bend at the surface (Figure 2.13). The
reason behind this curious effect is that the image of the rod inside the water forms a little closer to the surface
than the actual position of the rod, so it does not line up with the part of the rod that is above the water. The
same phenomenon explains why a fish in water appears to be closer to the surface than it actually is.

      Figure 2.13 Bending of a rod at a water-air interface. Point P on the rod appears to be at point Q, which is where the image of point P
      forms due to refraction at the air-water interface.

     To study image formation as a result of refraction, consider the following questions:

1. What happens to the rays of light when they enter or pass through a different medium?
2. Do the refracted rays originating from a single point meet at some point or diverge away from each other?

     To be concrete, we consider a simple system consisting of two media separated by a plane interface (Figure
     2.14). The object is in one medium and the observer is in the other. For instance, when you look at a fish from
     above the water surface, the fish is in medium 1 (the water) with refractive index 1.33, and your eye is in
     medium 2 (the air) with refractive index 1.00, and the surface of the water is the interface. The depth that you
     "see" is the image height and is called the apparent depth. The actual depth of the fish is the object height

        .
66  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    Figure 2.14 Apparent depth due to refraction. The real object at point P creates an image at point Q. The image is not at the same depth
    as the object, so the observer sees the image at an "apparent depth."

    The apparent depth depends on the angle at which you view the image. For a view from above (the so-called

    "normal" view), we can approximate the refraction angle to be small, and replace sin in Snell's law by tan .

    With this approximation, you can use the triangles  and                       to show that the apparent depth is given

    by

                                                                                     2.10

    The derivation of this result is left as an exercise. Thus, a fish appears at 3/4 of the real depth when viewed
    from above.

    Refraction at a Spherical Interface

    Spherical shapes play an important role in optics primarily because high-quality spherical shapes are far
    easier to manufacture than other curved surfaces. To study refraction at a single spherical surface, we assume
    that the medium with the spherical surface at one end continues indefinitely (a "semi-infinite" medium).

    Refraction at a convex surface

    Consider a point source of light at point P in front of a convex surface made of glass (see Figure 2.15). Let R be
    the radius of curvature, be the refractive index of the medium in which object point P is located, and be
    the refractive index of the medium with the spherical surface. We want to know what happens as a result of
    refraction at this interface.

                                      Figure 2.15 Refraction at a convex surface  .

    Because of the symmetry involved, it is sufficient to examine rays in only one plane. The figure shows a ray of
    light that starts at the object point P, refracts at the interface, and goes through the image point . We derive a
    formula relating the object distance , the image distance , and the radius of curvature R.

Applying Snell's law to the ray emanating from point P gives                            . We work in the small-angle

approximation, so  and Snell's law then takes the form

From the geometry of the figure, we see that

Inserting these expressions into Snell's law gives

Using the diagram, we calculate the tangent of the angles     :

Again using the small-angle approximation, we find that       , so the above relationships become

Putting these angles into Snell's law gives

We can write this more conveniently as

                                                                                                                                         2.11

If the object is placed at a special point called the first focus, or the object focus  , then the image is formed
at infinity, as shown in part (a) of Figure 2.16.

Figure 2.16 (a) First focus (called the "object focus") for refraction at a convex surface. (b) Second focus (called "image focus") for

We can find the location of the first focus by setting        in the preceding equation.

Similarly, we can define a second focus or image focus where the image is formed for an object that is far

away [part (b)]. The location of the second focus is obtained from Equation 2.11 by setting  :

    surface, provided we use the following sign convention:

    2.4 Thin Lenses

    Learning Objectives
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     · Use ray diagrams to locate and describe the image formed by a lens

     · Employ the thin-lens equation to describe and locate the image formed by a lens

    Lenses are found in a huge array of optical instruments, ranging from a simple magnifying glass to a camera's
    zoom lens to the eye itself. In this section, we use the Snell's law to explore the properties of lenses and how
    they form images.

    The word "lens" derives from the Latin word for a lentil bean, the shape of which is similar to a convex lens.
    However, not all lenses have the same shape. Figure 2.17 shows a variety of different lens shapes. The
    vocabulary used to describe lenses is the same as that used for spherical mirrors: The axis of symmetry of a
    lens is called the optical axis, where this axis intersects the lens surface is called the vertex of the lens, and so
    forth.

        Figure 2.17 Various types of lenses: Note that a converging lens has a thicker "waist," whereas a diverging lens has a thinner waist.

    A convex or converging lens is shaped so that all light rays that enter it parallel to its optical axis intersect (or
    focus) at a single point on the optical axis on the opposite side of the lens, as shown in part (a) of Figure 2.18.
    Likewise, a concave or diverging lens is shaped so that all rays that enter it parallel to its optical axis diverge,
    as shown in part (b). To understand more precisely how a lens manipulates light, look closely at the top ray
    that goes through the converging lens in part (a). Because the index of refraction of the lens is greater than that
    of air, Snell's law tells us that the ray is bent toward the perpendicular to the interface as it enters the lens.
    Likewise, when the ray exits the lens, it is bent away from the perpendicular. The same reasoning applies to the
    diverging lenses, as shown in part (b). The overall effect is that light rays are bent toward the optical axis for a
    converging lens and away from the optical axis for diverging lenses. For a converging lens, the point at which

the rays cross is the focal point F of the lens. For a diverging lens, the point from which the rays appear to
originate is the (virtual) focal point. The distance from the center of the lens to its focal point is the focal length
f of the lens.

Figure 2.18 Rays of light entering (a) a converging lens and (b) a diverging lens, parallel to its axis, converge at its focal point F. The
distance from the center of the lens to the focal point is the lens's focal length f. Note that the light rays are bent upon entering and exiting
the lens, with the overall effect being to bend the rays toward the optical axis.

A lens is considered to be thin if its thickness t is much less than the radii of curvature of both surfaces, as
shown in Figure 2.19. In this case, the rays may be considered to bend once at the center of the lens. For the
case drawn in the figure, light ray 1 is parallel to the optical axis, so the outgoing ray is bent once at the center
of the lens and goes through the focal point. Another important characteristic of thin lenses is that light rays
that pass through the center of the lens are undeviated, as shown by light ray 2.

Figure 2.19 In the thin-lens approximation, the thickness t of the lens is much, much less than the radii and of curvature of the
surfaces of the lens. Light rays are considered to bend at the center of the lens, such as light ray 1. Light ray 2 passes through the center of
the lens and is undeviated in the thin-lens approximation.

As noted in the initial discussion of Snell's law, the paths of light rays are exactly reversible. This means that
the direction of the arrows could be reversed for all of the rays in Figure 2.18. For example, if a point-light
source is placed at the focal point of a convex lens, as shown in Figure 2.20, parallel light rays emerge from the
other side.
70  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

          Figure 2.20 A small light source, like a light bulb filament, placed at the focal point of a convex lens results in parallel rays of light
          emerging from the other side. The paths are exactly the reverse of those shown in Figure 2.18 in converging and diverging lenses. This
          technique is used in lighthouses and sometimes in traffic lights to produce a directional beam of light from a source that emits light in all
          directions.

       Ray Tracing and Thin Lenses

         Ray tracing is the technique of determining or following (tracing) the paths taken by light rays.

         Ray tracing for thin lenses is very similar to the technique we used with spherical mirrors. As for mirrors, ray
         tracing can accurately describe the operation of a lens. The rules for ray tracing for thin lenses are similar to
         those of spherical mirrors:

    1. A ray entering a converging lens parallel to the optical axis passes through the focal point on the other side of
         the lens (ray 1 in part (a) of Figure 2.21). A ray entering a diverging lens parallel to the optical axis exits along
         the line that passes through the focal point on the same side of the lens (ray 1 in part (b) of the figure).

    2. A ray passing through the center of either a converging or a diverging lens is not deviated (ray 2 in parts (a) and
         (b)).

    3. For a converging lens, a ray that passes through the focal point exits the lens parallel to the optical axis (ray 3
         in part (a)). For a diverging lens, a ray that approaches along the line that passes through the focal point on the
         opposite side exits the lens parallel to the axis (ray 3 in part (b)).

Figure 2.21 Thin lenses have the same focal lengths on either side. (a) Parallel light rays from the object toward a converging lens cross at
its focal point on the right. (b) Parallel light rays from the object entering a diverging lens from the left seem to come from the focal point on
the left.

Thin lenses work quite well for monochromatic light (i.e., light of a single wavelength). However, for light that
contains several wavelengths (e.g., white light), the lenses work less well. The problem is that, as we learned in
the previous chapter, the index of refraction of a material depends on the wavelength of light. This
phenomenon is responsible for many colorful effects, such as rainbows. Unfortunately, this phenomenon also
leads to aberrations in images formed by lenses. In particular, because the focal distance of the lens depends
on the index of refraction, it also depends on the wavelength of the incident light. This means that light of
different wavelengths will focus at different points, resulting is so-called "chromatic aberrations." In particular,
the edges of an image of a white object will become colored and blurred. Special lenses called doublets are
capable of correcting chromatic aberrations. A doublet is formed by gluing together a converging lens and a
diverging lens. The combined doublet lens produces significantly reduced chromatic aberrations.

Image Formation by Thin Lenses

We use ray tracing to investigate different types of images that can be created by a lens. In some
circumstances, a lens forms a real image, such as when a movie projector casts an image onto a screen. In
other cases, the image is a virtual image, which cannot be projected onto a screen. Where, for example, is the
image formed by eyeglasses? We use ray tracing for thin lenses to illustrate how they form images, and then we
develop equations to analyze quantitatively the properties of thin lenses.

Consider an object some distance away from a converging lens, as shown in Figure 2.22. To find the location
and size of the image, we trace the paths of selected light rays originating from one point on the object, in this
case, the tip of the arrow. The figure shows three rays from many rays that emanate from the tip of the arrow.
These three rays can be traced by using the ray-tracing rules given above.

  · Ray 1 enters the lens parallel to the optical axis and passes through the focal point on the opposite side
      (rule 1).

  · Ray 2 passes through the center of the lens and is not deviated (rule 2).
72  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

      · Ray 3 passes through the focal point on its way to the lens and exits the lens parallel to the optical axis
          (rule 3).

    The three rays cross at a single point on the opposite side of the lens. Thus, the image of the tip of the arrow is
    located at this point. All rays that come from the tip of the arrow and enter the lens are refracted and cross at
    the point shown.

    After locating the image of the tip of the arrow, we need another point of the image to orient the entire image of
    the arrow. We chose to locate the image base of the arrow, which is on the optical axis. As explained in the
    section on spherical mirrors, the base will be on the optical axis just above the image of the tip of the arrow
    (due to the top-bottom symmetry of the lens). Thus, the image spans the optical axis to the (negative) height
    shown. Rays from another point on the arrow, such as the middle of the arrow, cross at another common point,
    thus filling in the rest of the image.

    Although three rays are traced in this figure, only two are necessary to locate a point of the image. It is best to
    trace rays for which there are simple ray-tracing rules.

    Figure 2.22 Ray tracing is used to locate the image formed by a lens. Rays originating from the same point on the object are traced--the
    three chosen rays each follow one of the rules for ray tracing, so that their paths are easy to determine. The image is located at the point
    where the rays cross. In this case, a real image--one that can be projected on a screen--is formed.

    Several important distances appear in the figure. As for a mirror, we define to be the object distance, or the
    distance of an object from the center of a lens. The image distance is defined to be the distance of the image
    from the center of a lens. The height of the object and the height of the image are indicated by and ,
    respectively. Images that appear upright relative to the object have positive heights, and those that are inverted
    have negative heights. By using the rules of ray tracing and making a scale drawing with paper and pencil, like
    that in Figure 2.22, we can accurately describe the location and size of an image. But the real benefit of ray
    tracing is in visualizing how images are formed in a variety of situations.

    Oblique Parallel Rays and Focal Plane

    We have seen that rays parallel to the optical axis are directed to the focal point of a converging lens. In the
    case of a diverging lens, they come out in a direction such that they appear to be coming from the focal point
    on the opposite side of the lens (i.e., the side from which parallel rays enter the lens). What happens to parallel
    rays that are not parallel to the optical axis (Figure 2.23)? In the case of a converging lens, these rays do not
    converge at the focal point. Instead, they come together on another point in the plane called the focal plane.
    The focal plane contains the focal point and is perpendicular to the optical axis. As shown in the figure, parallel
    rays focus where the ray through the center of the lens crosses the focal plane.

Thin-Lens Equation

Ray tracing allows us to get a qualitative picture of image formation. To obtain numeric information, we derive
a pair of equations from a geometric analysis of ray tracing for thin lenses. These equations, called the thin-
lens equation and the lens maker's equation, allow us to quantitatively analyze thin lenses.

Consider the thick bi-convex lens shown in Figure 2.24. The index of refraction of the surrounding medium is

(if the lens is in air, then  ) and that of the lens is . The radii of curvatures of the two sides are

. We wish to find a relation between the object distance , the image distance , and the

parameters of the lens.

Figure 2.24 Figure for deriving the lens maker's equation. Here, t is the thickness of lens, is the index of refraction of the exterior

medium, and is the index of refraction of the lens. We take the limit of  to obtain the formula for a thin lens.

To derive the thin-lens equation, we consider the image formed by the first refracting surface (i.e., left surface)
and then use this image as the object for the second refracting surface. In the figure, the image from the first
refracting surface is , which is formed by extending backwards the rays from inside the lens (these rays
result from refraction at the first surface). This is shown by the dashed lines in the figure. Notice that this
image is virtual because no rays actually pass through the point . To find the image distance

corresponding to the image , we use Equation 2.11. In this case, the object distance is , the image distance
is , and the radius of curvature is . Inserting these into Equation 2.3 gives

                                                                                                                  2.14

The image is virtual and on the same side as the object, so               and  . The first surface is convex
74  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    toward the object, so             .

    To find the object distance for the object Q formed by refraction from the second interface, note that the role of
    the indices of refraction and are interchanged in Equation 2.11. In Figure 2.24, the rays originate in the
    medium with index , whereas in Figure 2.15, the rays originate in the medium with index . Thus, we must
    interchange and in Equation 2.11. In addition, by consulting again Figure 2.24, we see that the object
    distance is and the image distance is . The radius of curvature is Inserting these quantities into
    Equation 2.11 gives

                                                                                                                    2.15

    The image is real and on the opposite side from the object, so  and                    . The second surface is convex

    away from the object, so             . Equation 2.15 can be simplified by noting that  , where we have

    taken the absolute value because is a negative number, whereas both and t are positive. We can dispense

    with the absolute value if we negate , which gives              . Inserting this into Equation 2.15 gives

                                                                                                                    2.16

    Summing Equation 2.14 and Equation 2.16 gives

                                                                                                                    2.17

    In the thin-lens approximation, we assume that the lens is very thin compared to the first image distance, or

    (or, equivalently,                        ). In this case, the third and fourth terms on the left-hand side of

    Equation 2.17 cancel, leaving us with

    Dividing by gives us finally

                                                                                                                                                         2.18

    The left-hand side looks suspiciously like the mirror equation that we derived above for spherical mirrors. As
    done for spherical mirrors, we can use ray tracing and geometry to show that, for a thin lens,

                                                                                                                    2.19

    where f is the focal length of the thin lens (this derivation is left as an exercise). This is the thin-lens equation.
    The focal length of a thin lens is the same to the left and to the right of the lens. Combining Equation 2.18 and

    of curvature and the index of refraction of the lens and that of the surrounding medium. For a lens in air,

Equation 2.8). If    , then the image has the same vertical orientation as the object (called an "upright"

image). If           , then the image has the opposite vertical orientation as the object (called an "inverted" image).

Using the Thin-Lens Equation

The thin-lens equation and the lens maker's equation are broadly applicable to situations involving thin
lenses. We explore many features of image formation in the following examples.

Consider a thin converging lens. Where does the image form and what type of image is formed as the object
approaches the lens from infinity? This may be seen by using the thin-lens equation for a given focal length to
plot the image distance as a function of object distance. In other words, we plot

for a given value of f. For     , the result is shown in part (a) of Figure 2.25.

Figure 2.25 (a) Image distance for a thin converging lens with  as a function of object distance. (b) Same thing but for a

diverging lens with          .

An object much farther than the focal length f from the lens should produce an image near the focal plane,

because the second term on the right-hand side of the equation above becomes negligible compared to the first

term, so we have             This can be seen in the plot of part (a) of the figure, which shows that the image

distance approaches asymptotically the focal length of 1 cm for larger object distances. As the object

approaches the focal plane, the image distance diverges to positive infinity. This is expected because an object

at the focal plane produces parallel rays that form an image at infinity (i.e., very far from the lens). When the
76  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    object is farther than the focal length from the lens, the image distance is positive, so the image is real, on the

    opposite side of the lens from the object, and inverted (because  ). When the object is closer than

    the focal length from the lens, the image distance becomes negative, which means that the image is virtual, on

    the same side of the lens as the object, and upright.

    For a thin diverging lens of focal length              , a similar plot of image distance vs. object distance is

    shown in part (b). In this case, the image distance is negative for all positive object distances, which means that

    the image is virtual, on the same side of the lens as the object, and upright. These characteristics may also be

    seen by ray-tracing diagrams (see Figure 2.26).

    Figure 2.26 The red dots show the focal points of the lenses. (a) A real, inverted image formed from an object that is farther than the focal
    length from a converging lens. (b) A virtual, upright image formed from an object that is closer than a focal length from the lens. (c) A virtual,
    upright image formed from an object that is farther than a focal length from a diverging lens.

    To see a concrete example of upright and inverted images, look at Figure 2.27, which shows images formed by
    converging lenses when the object (the person's face in this case) is place at different distances from the lens.
    In part (a) of the figure, the person's face is farther than one focal length from the lens, so the image is inverted.
    In part (b), the person's face is closer than one focal length from the lens, so the image is upright.

    Figure 2.27 (a) When a converging lens is held farther than one focal length from the man's face, an inverted image is formed. Note that
    the image is in focus but the face is not, because the image is much closer to the camera taking this photograph than the face. (b) An
    upright image of the man's face is produced when a converging lens is held at less than one focal length from his face. (credit a:

    EXAMPLE 2.5

Choosing the Focal Length and Type of Lens

To project an image of a light bulb on a screen 1.50 m away, you need to choose what type of lens to use
(converging or diverging) and its focal length (Figure 2.28). The distance between the lens and the lightbulb is
fixed at 0.75 m. Also, what is the magnification and orientation of the image?

Strategy

The image must be real, so you choose to use a converging lens. The focal length can be found by using the

thin-lens equation and solving for the focal length. The object distance is  and the image distance

is        .

Solution
Solve the thin lens for the focal length and insert the desired object and image distances:

The magnification is

Significance
The minus sign for the magnification means that the image is inverted. The focal length is positive, as
expected for a converging lens. Ray tracing can be used to check the calculation (see Figure 2.28). As expected,
the image is inverted, is real, and is larger than the object.

Figure 2.28 A light bulb placed 0.75 m from a lens having a 0.50-m focal length produces a real image on a screen, as discussed in the
example. Ray tracing predicts the image location and size.

2.5 The Eye

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Understand the basic physics of how images are formed by the human eye
 · Recognize several conditions of impaired vision as well as the optics principles for treating these conditions

The human eye is perhaps the most interesting and important of all optical instruments. Our eyes perform a
vast number of functions: They allow us to sense direction, movement, colors, and distance. In this section, we
80  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    explore the geometric optics of the eye.

    Physics of the Eye

    The eye is remarkable in how it forms images and in the richness of detail and color it can detect. However, our
    eyes often need some correction to reach what is called "normal" vision. Actually, normal vision should be
    called "ideal" vision because nearly one-half of the human population requires some sort of eyesight
    correction, so requiring glasses is by no means "abnormal." Image formation by our eyes and common vision
    correction can be analyzed with the optics discussed earlier in this chapter.

    Figure 2.29 shows the basic anatomy of the eye. The cornea and lens form a system that, to a good

    approximation, acts as a single thin lens. For clear vision, a real image must be projected onto the light-

    sensitive retina, which lies a fixed distance from the lens. The flexible lens of the eye allows it to adjust the

    radius of curvature of the lens to produce an image on the retina for objects at different distances. The center

    of the image falls on the fovea, which has the greatest density of light receptors and the greatest acuity

    (sharpness) in the visual field. The variable opening (i.e., the pupil) of the eye, along with chemical adaptation,

    allows the eye to detect light intensities from the lowest observable to  times greater (without damage).

    This is an incredible range of detection. Processing of visual nerve impulses begins with interconnections in

    the retina and continues in the brain. The optic nerve conveys the signals received by the eye to the brain.

    Figure 2.29 The cornea and lens of the eye act together to form a real image on the light-sensing retina, which has its densest

    concentration of receptors in the fovea and a blind spot over the optic nerve. The radius of curvature of the lens of an eye is adjustable to

    form an image on the retina for different object distances. Layers of tissues with varying indices of refraction in the lens are shown here.

    However, they have been omitted from other pictures for clarity.

    The indices of refraction in the eye are crucial to its ability to form images. Table 2.1 lists the indices of
    refraction relevant to the eye. The biggest change in the index of refraction, which is where the light rays are
    most bent, occurs at the air-cornea interface rather than at the aqueous humor-lens interface. The ray diagram
    in Figure 2.30 shows image formation by the cornea and lens of the eye. The cornea, which is itself a
    converging lens with a focal length of approximately 2.3 cm, provides most of the focusing power of the eye.
    The lens, which is a converging lens with a focal length of about 6.4 cm, provides the finer focus needed to
    produce a clear image on the retina. The cornea and lens can be treated as a single thin lens, even though the
    light rays pass through several layers of material (such as cornea, aqueous humor, several layers in the lens,
    and vitreous humor), changing direction at each interface. The image formed is much like the one produced by
    a single convex lens (i.e., a real, inverted image). Although images formed in the eye are inverted, the brain
    inverts them once more to make them seem upright.

Figure 2.30 In the human eye, an image forms on the retina. Rays from the top and bottom of the object are traced to show how a real,
inverted image is produced on the retina. The distance to the object is not to scale.

As noted, the image must fall precisely on the retina to produce clear vision--that is, the image distance
must equal the lens-to-retina distance. Because the lens-to-retina distance does not change, the image
distance must be the same for objects at all distances. The ciliary muscles adjust the shape of the eye lens
for focusing on nearby or far objects. By changing the shape of the eye lens, the eye changes the focal length of
the lens. This mechanism of the eye is called accommodation.

The nearest point an object can be placed so that the eye can form a clear image on the retina is called the near
point of the eye. Similarly, the far point is the farthest distance at which an object is clearly visible. A person
with normal vision can see objects clearly at distances ranging from 25 cm to essentially infinity. The near
point increases with age, becoming several meters for some older people. In this text, we consider the near
point to be 25 cm.

We can use the thin-lens equations to quantitatively examine image formation by the eye. First, we define the
optical power of a lens as

                                                                                                                                                     2.23

with the focal length f given in meters. The units of optical power are called "diopters" (D). That is,
                           . Optometrists prescribe common eyeglasses and contact lenses in units of diopters. With

this definition of optical power, we can rewrite the thin-lens equations as
82  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

                                                                                                                                                         2.24

    Working with optical power is convenient because, for two or more lenses close together, the effective optical
    power of the lens system is approximately the sum of the optical power of the individual lenses:

                                                                                                                                                         2.25

    Strategy

    The optical powers of the closely spaced lenses add, so             .

    Solution
    Writing the equation for power in terms of the focal lengths gives

    Hence, the focal length of the eye (cornea and lens together) is
    The optical power of the eye is

    For clear vision, the image distance must equal the lens-to-retina distance. Normal vision is possible for

    objects at distances              to infinity. The following example shows how to calculate the image distance

    for an object placed at the near point of the eye.

    The near point is 25 cm from the eye, so the object distance is
    from the lens equation:

    Solution

                                                                 2.5 · The Eye                                                                83

Therefore, the image is formed 1.8 cm behind the lens.

Significance

From the magnification formula, we find                 . Since  , the image is inverted in

orientation with respect to the object. From the absolute value of m we see that the image is much smaller than
the object; in fact, it is only 7% of the size of the object.

Vision Correction

The need for some type of vision correction is very common. Typical vision defects are easy to understand
with geometric optics, and some are simple to correct. Figure 2.31 illustrates two common vision defects.
Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the ability to see near objects, whereas distant objects are blurry. The eye
overconverges the nearly parallel rays from a distant object, and the rays cross in front of the retina. More
divergent rays from a close object are converged on the retina for a clear image. The distance to the farthest
object that can be seen clearly is called the far point of the eye (normally the far point is at infinity).
Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the ability to see far objects clearly, whereas near objects are blurry. A
farsighted eye does not sufficiently converge the rays from a near object to make the rays meet on the retina.

Figure 2.31 (a) The nearsighted (myopic) eye converges rays from a distant object in front of the retina, so they have diverged when they
strike the retina, producing a blurry image. An eye lens that is too powerful can cause nearsightedness, or the eye may be too long. (b) The
farsighted (hyperopic) eye is unable to converge the rays from a close object on the retina, producing blurry near-field vision. An eye lens
with insufficient optical power or an eye that is too short can cause farsightedness.

Since the nearsighted eye overconverges light rays, the correction for nearsightedness consists of placing a
diverging eyeglass lens in front of the eye, as shown in Figure 2.32. This reduces the optical power of an eye
that is too powerful (recall that the focal length of a diverging lens is negative, so its optical power is negative).
Another way to understand this correction is that a diverging lens will cause the incoming rays to diverge more
to compensate for the excessive convergence caused by the lens system of the eye. The image produced by the
84  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    diverging eyeglass lens serves as the (optical) object for the eye, and because the eye cannot focus on objects
    beyond its far point, the diverging lens must form an image of distant (physical) objects at a point that is closer
    than the far point.

    Figure 2.32 Correction of nearsightedness requires a diverging lens that compensates for overconvergence by the eye. The diverging lens
    produces an image closer to the eye than the physical object. This image serves as the optical object for the eye, and the nearsighted
    person can see it clearly because it is closer than their far point.

    EXAMPLE 2.8

    Correcting Nearsightedness

    What optical power of eyeglass lens is needed to correct the vision of a nearsighted person whose far point is
    30.0 cm? Assume the corrective lens is fixed 1.50 cm away from the eye.

    Strategy

    You want this nearsighted person to be able to see distant objects clearly, which means that the eyeglass lens

    must produce an image 30.0 cm from the eye for an object at infinity. An image 30.0 cm from the eye will be

                 from the eyeglass lens. Therefore, we must have  when                                           .

    The image distance is negative because it is on the same side of the eyeglass lens as the object.

    Solution   are known, we can find the optical power of the eyeglass lens by using Equation 2.24:
    Since and

    Significance
    The negative optical power indicates a diverging (or concave) lens, as expected. If you examine eyeglasses for
    nearsighted people, you will find the lenses are thinnest in the center. Additionally, if you examine a
    prescription for eyeglasses for nearsighted people, you will find that the prescribed optical power is negative

and given in units of diopters.

Correcting farsightedness consists simply of using the opposite type of lens as for nearsightedness (i.e., a
converging lens), as shown in Figure 2.33.
Such a lens will produce an image of physical objects that are closer than the near point at a distance that is
between the near point and the far point, so that the person can see the image clearly. To determine the optical
power needed for correction, you must therefore know the person's near point, as explained in Example 2.9.

Figure 2.33 Correction of farsightedness uses a converging lens that compensates for the underconvergence by the eye. The converging
lens produces an image farther from the eye than the object, so that the farsighted person can see it clearly.

EXAMPLE 2.9

Correcting Farsightedness

What optical power of eyeglass lens is needed to allow a farsighted person, whose near point is 1.00 m, to see
an object clearly that is 25.0 cm from the eye? Assume the corrective lens is fixed 1.5 cm from the eye.

Strategy

When an object is 25.0 cm from the person's eyes, the eyeglass lens must produce an image 1.00 m away (the

near point), so that the person can see it clearly. An image 1.00 m from the eye will be

             from the eyeglass lens because the eyeglass lens is 1.5 cm from the eye. Therefore,

           , where the minus sign indicates that the image is on the same side of the lens as the object. The

object is    from the eyeglass lens, so  .

Solution   are known, we can find the optical power of the eyeglass lens by using Equation 2.24:

86  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    Significance
    The positive optical power indicates a converging (convex) lens, as expected. If you examine eyeglasses of
    farsighted people, you will find the lenses to be thickest in the center. In addition, prescription eyeglasses for
    farsighted people have a prescribed optical power that is positive.

    2.6 The Camera

    Learning Objectives
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     · Describe the optics of a camera
     · Characterize the image created by a camera

    Cameras are very common in our everyday life. Between 1825 and 1827, French inventor Nicéphore Niépce
    successfully photographed an image created by a primitive camera. Since then, enormous progress has been
    achieved in the design of cameras and camera-based detectors.

    Initially, photographs were recorded by using the light-sensitive reaction of silver-based compounds such as
    silver chloride or silver bromide. Silver-based photographic paper was in common use until the advent of
    digital photography in the 1980s, which is intimately connected to charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors. In
    a nutshell, a CCD is a semiconductor chip that records images as a matrix of tiny pixels, each pixel located in a
    "bin" in the surface. Each pixel is capable of detecting the intensity of light impinging on it. Color is brought
    into play by putting red-, blue-, and green-colored filters over the pixels, resulting in colored digital images
    (Figure 2.34). At its best resolution, one CCD pixel corresponds to one pixel of the image. To reduce the
    resolution and decrease the size of the file, we can "bin" several CCD pixels into one, resulting in a smaller but
    "pixelated" image.

    Figure 2.34 A charge-coupled device (CCD) converts light signals into electronic signals, enabling electronic processing and storage of
    visual images. This is the basis for electronic imaging in all digital cameras, from cell phones to movie cameras. (credit left: modification of
    work by Bruce Turner)

    Clearly, electronics is a big part of a digital camera; however, the underlying physics is basic optics. As a matter
    of fact, the optics of a camera are pretty much the same as those of a single lens with an object distance that is
    significantly larger than the lens's focal distance (Figure 2.35).

Figure 2.35 Modern digital cameras have several lenses to produce a clear image with minimal aberration and use red, blue, and green
filters to produce a color image.

For instance, let us consider the camera in a smartphone. An average smartphone camera is equipped with a
stationary wide-angle lens with a focal length of about 4-5 mm. (This focal length is about equal to the
thickness of the phone.) The image created by the lens is focused on the CCD detector mounted at the opposite
side of the phone. In a cell phone, the lens and the CCD cannot move relative to each other. So how do we make
sure that both the images of a distant and a close object are in focus?

Recall that a human eye can accommodate for distant and close images by changing its focal distance. A cell
phone camera cannot do that because the distance from the lens to the detector is fixed. Here is where the
small focal distance becomes important. Let us assume we have a camera with a 5-mm focal distance. What is
the image distance for a selfie? The object distance for a selfie (the length of the hand holding the phone) is
about 50 cm. Using the thin-lens equation, we can write

We then obtain the image distance:

Note that the object distance is 100 times larger than the focal distance. We can clearly see that the 1/(500 mm)

term is significantly smaller than 1/(5 mm), which means that the image distance is pretty much equal to the

lens's focal length. An actual calculation gives us the image distance  . This value is extremely

close to the lens's focal distance.

Now let us consider the case of a distant object. Let us say that we would like to take a picture of a person
standing about 5 m from us. Using the thin-lens equation again, we obtain the image distance of 5.005 mm.
The farther the object is from the lens, the closer the image distance is to the focal distance. At the limiting
case of an infinitely distant object, we obtain the image distance exactly equal to the focal distance of the lens.

As you can see, the difference between the image distance for a selfie and the image distance for a distant
object is just about 0.05 mm or 50 microns. Even a short object distance such as the length of your hand is two
orders of magnitude larger than the lens's focal length, resulting in minute variations of the image distance.

    (The 50-micron difference is smaller than the thickness of an average sheet of paper.) Such a small difference
    can be easily accommodated by the same detector, positioned at the focal distance of the lens. Image analysis
    software can help improve image quality.

    Conventional point-and-shoot cameras often use a movable lens to change the lens-to-image distance.
    Complex lenses of the more expensive mirror reflex cameras allow for superb quality photographic images.
    The optics of these camera lenses is beyond the scope of this textbook.

    2.7 The Simple Magnifier

    Learning Objectives
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     · Understand the optics of a simple magnifier
     · Characterize the image created by a simple magnifier

    The apparent size of an object perceived by the eye depends on the angle the object subtends from the eye. As
    shown in Figure 2.36, the object at A subtends a larger angle from the eye than when it is position at point B.
    Thus, the object at A forms a larger image on the retina (see ) than when it is positioned at B (see ).
    Thus, objects that subtend large angles from the eye appear larger because they form larger images on the
    retina.

    Figure 2.36 Size perceived by an eye is determined by the angle subtended by the object. An image formed on the retina by an object at A

    is larger than an image formed on the retina by the same object positioned at B (compared image heights  to ).

    We have seen that, when an object is placed within a focal length of a convex lens, its image is virtual, upright,
    and larger than the object (see part (b) of Figure 2.26). Thus, when such an image produced by a convex lens
    serves as the object for the eye, as shown in Figure 2.37, the image on the retina is enlarged, because the image
    produced by the lens subtends a larger angle in the eye than does the object. A convex lens used for this
    purpose is called a magnifying glass or a simple magnifier.

Figure 2.37 The simple magnifier is a convex lens used to produce an enlarged image of an object on the retina. (a) With no convex lens,

the object subtends an angle  from the eye. (b) With the convex lens in place, the image produced by the convex lens subtends an

angle    from the eye, with      . Thus, the image on the retina is larger with the convex lens in place.

To account for the magnification of a magnifying lens, we compare the angle subtended by the image (created

by the lens) with the angle subtended by the object (viewed with no lens), as shown in Figure 2.37. We assume

that the object is situated at the near point of the eye, because this is the object distance at which the unaided

eye can form the largest image on the retina. We will compare the magnified images created by a lens with this

maximum image size for the unaided eye. The magnification of an image when observed by the eye is the

angular magnification M, which is defined by the ratio of the angle  subtended by the image to the angle

       subtended by the object:

                                                                                                           2.26

Consider the situation shown in Figure 2.37. The magnifying lens is held a distance l from the eye, and the

image produced by the magnifier forms a distance L from the eye. We want to calculate the angular

magnification for any arbitrary L and l . In the small-angle approximation, the angular size               of the image

is . The angular size            of the object at the near point is  . The angular magnification

is then

                                                                                                           2.27
90  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    Using Equation 2.8 for linear magnification

    and the thin-lens equation

    in Equation 2.27, we arrive at the following expression for the angular magnification of a magnifying lens:

                                                                                                            2.28

    From part (b) of the figure, we see that the absolute value of the image distance is     l . Note that

    because the image is virtual, so we can dispense with the absolute value by explicitly inserting the

    minus sign:  l . Inserting this into Equation 2.28 gives us the final equation for the angular

    magnification of a magnifying lens:

                                                        l

                                                                                                              2.29

    Note that all the quantities in this equation have to be expressed in centimeters. Often, we want the image to be

    at the near-point distance (              ) to get maximum magnification, and we hold the magnifying lens close

    to the eye (l ). In this case, Equation 2.29 gives

                                                                                                            2.30

    which shows that the greatest magnification occurs for the lens with the shortest focal length. In addition,

    when the image is at the near-point distance and the lens is held close to the eye l  , then

    and Equation 2.27 becomes

                                                                                                            2.31

    where m is the linear magnification (Equation 2.32) derived for spherical mirrors and thin lenses. Another

    useful situation is when the image is at infinity   . Equation 2.29 then takes the form

                                                                                                            2.32

    The resulting magnification is simply the ratio of the near-point distance to the focal length of the magnifying
    lens, so a lens with a shorter focal length gives a stronger magnification. Although this magnification is smaller
    by 1 than the magnification obtained with the image at the near point, it provides for the most comfortable
    viewing conditions, because the eye is relaxed when viewing a distant object.

    By comparing Equation 2.29 with Equation 2.32, we see that the range of angular magnification of a given
    converging lens is

                                                                                                            2.33

EXAMPLE 2.10

Magnifying a Diamond

A jeweler wishes to inspect a 3.0-mm-diameter diamond with a magnifier. The diamond is held at the jeweler's
near point (25 cm), and the jeweler holds the magnifying lens close to his eye.

(a) What should the focal length of the magnifying lens be to see a 15-mm-diameter image of the diamond?

(b) What should the focal length of the magnifying lens be to obtain  magnification?

Strategy
We need to determine the requisite magnification of the magnifier. Because the jeweler holds the magnifying
lens close to his eye, we can use Equation 2.30 to find the focal length of the magnifying lens.

Solution

a. The required linear magnification is the ratio of the desired image diameter to the diamond's actual
     diameter (Equation 2.32). Because the jeweler holds the magnifying lens close to his eye and the image
     forms at his near point, the linear magnification is the same as the angular magnification, so

The focal length f of the magnifying lens may be calculated by solving Equation 2.30 for f, which gives

b. To get an image magnified by a factor of ten, we again solve Equation 2.30 for f, but this time we use
                . The result is

Significance

Note that a greater magnification is achieved by using a lens with a smaller focal length. We thus need to use a
lens with radii of curvature that are less than a few centimeters and hold it very close to our eye. This is not
very convenient. A compound microscope, explored in the following section, can overcome this drawback.

2.8 Microscopes and Telescopes

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Explain the physics behind the operation of microscopes and telescopes
 · Describe the image created by these instruments and calculate their magnifications

Microscopes and telescopes are major instruments that have contributed hugely to our current understanding
of the micro- and macroscopic worlds. The invention of these devices led to numerous discoveries in
disciplines such as physics, astronomy, and biology, to name a few. In this section, we explain the basic physics
that make these instruments work.

Microscopes

Although the eye is marvelous in its ability to see objects large and small, it obviously is limited in the smallest

details it can detect. The desire to see beyond what is possible with the naked eye led to the use of optical

instruments. We have seen that a simple convex lens can create a magnified image, but it is hard to get large

magnification with such a lens. A magnification greater than  is difficult without distorting the image. To

get higher magnification, we can combine the simple magnifying glass with one or more additional lenses. In

this section, we examine microscopes that enlarge the details that we cannot see with the naked eye.
92  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    Microscopes were first developed in the early 1600s by eyeglass makers in The Netherlands and Denmark. The

    simplest compound microscope is constructed from two convex lenses (Figure 2.38). The objective lens is a

    convex lens of short focal length (i.e., high power) with typical magnification from  to  . The

    eyepiece, also referred to as the ocular, is a convex lens of longer focal length.

    The purpose of a microscope is to create magnified images of small objects, and both lenses contribute to the
    final magnification. Also, the final enlarged image is produced sufficiently far from the observer to be easily
    viewed, since the eye cannot focus on objects or images that are too close (i.e., closer than the near point of the
    eye).

    Figure 2.38 A compound microscope is composed of two lenses: an objective and an eyepiece. The objective forms the first image, which
    is larger than the object. This first image is inside the focal length of the eyepiece and serves as the object for the eyepiece. The eyepiece
    forms the final image that is further magnified. The do and di shown will be discussed with superscripts "obj" below to denote they are
    measured from the objective lens, while the eye piece variables will have superscripts of "eye" to denote this lens.

    To see how the microscope in Figure 2.38 forms an image, consider its two lenses in succession. The object is

    just beyond the focal length      of the objective lens, producing a real, inverted image that is larger than the

    object. This first image serves as the object for the second lens, or eyepiece. The eyepiece is positioned so that

    the first image is within its focal length , so that it can further magnify the image. In a sense, it acts as a

    magnifying glass that magnifies the intermediate image produced by the objective. The image produced by the

    eyepiece is a magnified virtual image. The final image remains inverted but is farther from the observer than

    the object, making it easy to view.

    The eye views the virtual image created by the eyepiece, which serves as the object for the lens in the eye. The
    virtual image formed by the eyepiece is well outside the focal length of the eye, so the eye forms a real image on
    the retina.

    The magnification of the microscope is the product of the linear magnification        by the objective and the

    angular magnification             by the eyepiece. These are given by

    Access for free at openstax.org.

Here,  and         are the focal lengths of the objective and the eyepiece, respectively. We assume that the

final image is formed at the near point of the eye, providing the largest magnification. Note that the angular

magnification of the eyepiece is the same as obtained earlier for the simple magnifying glass. This should not

be surprising, because the eyepiece is essentially a magnifying glass, and the same physics applies here. The

net magnification  of the compound microscope is the product of the linear magnification of the

objective and the angular magnification of the eyepiece:

                                                                                                 2.34

       EXAMPLE 2.11

Microscope Magnification

Calculate the magnification of an object placed 6.20 mm from a compound microscope that has a 6.00 mm-
focal length objective and a 50.0 mm-focal length eyepiece. The objective and eyepiece are separated by 23.0
cm.

Strategy
This situation is similar to that shown in Figure 2.38. To find the overall magnification, we must know the
linear magnification of the objective and the angular magnification of the eyepiece. We can use Equation 2.34,
but we need to use the thin-lens equation to find the image distance of the objective.

Solution                            gives
Solving the thin-lens equation for

Inserting this result into Equation 2.34 along with the known values  and

                     gives

Significance

Both the objective and the eyepiece contribute to the overall magnification, which is large and negative,
consistent with Figure 2.38, where the image is seen to be large and inverted. In this case, the image is virtual
and inverted, which cannot happen for a single element (see Figure 2.26).
94  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

                            Figure 2.39 A compound microscope with the image created at infinity.

    We now calculate the magnifying power of a microscope when the image is at infinity, as shown in Figure 2.39,

    because this makes for the most relaxed viewing. The magnifying power of the microscope is the product of

    linear magnification    of the objective and the angular magnification  of the eyepiece. The

    magnification of the objective can be obtained from the thin-lens equation for magnification, which is

                                                                                                            2.35

    If the final image is at infinity, then the image created by the objective must be located at the focal point of the

    eyepiece. This may be seen by considering the thin-lens equation with   or by recalling that rays that

    pass through the focal point exit the lens parallel to each other, which is equivalent to focusing at infinity. For

    many microscopes, the distance between the image-side focal point of the objective and the object-side focal

    point of the eyepiece is standardized at  . This distance is called the tube length of the microscope. If

    the length of the compound microscope L is roughly the focal length of the objective, we can substitute L in for
    diobj to get

                                                                                                            2.36

    We now need to calculate the angular magnification of the eyepiece with the image at infinity. To do so, we take

    the ratio of the angle            subtended by the image to the angle  subtended by the object at the near

    point of the eye (this is the closest that the unaided eye can view the object, and thus this is the position where
    the object will form the largest image on the retina of the unaided eye). Using Figure 2.39 and working in the

    small-angle approximation, we have        and                           , where is the height of

    the image formed by the objective, which is the object of the eyepiece. Thus, the angular magnification of the
    eyepiece is

                                                                                                            2.37

The focal distances must be in centimeters. The minus sign indicates that the final image is inverted. Note that
the only variables in the equation are the focal distances of the eyepiece and the objective, which makes this
equation particularly useful.

Telescopes

Telescopes are meant for viewing distant objects and produce an image that is larger than the image produced
in the unaided eye. Telescopes gather far more light than the eye, allowing dim objects to be observed with
greater magnification and better resolution. Telescopes were invented around 1600, and Galileo was the first
to use them to study the heavens, with monumental consequences. He observed the moons of Jupiter, the
craters and mountains on the moon, the details of sunspots, and the fact that the Milky Way is composed of a
vast number of individual stars.

Figure 2.40 (a) Galileo made telescopes with a convex objective and a concave eyepiece. These produce an upright image and are used in
spyglasses. (b) Most simple refracting telescopes have two convex lenses. The objective forms a real, inverted image at (or just within) the
focal plane of the eyepiece. This image serves as the object for the eyepiece. The eyepiece forms a virtual, inverted image that is magnified.

Part (a) of Figure 2.40 shows a refracting telescope made of two lenses. The first lens, called the objective,
96  2 · Geometric Optics and Image Formation

    forms a real image within the focal length of the second lens, which is called the eyepiece. The image of the
    objective lens serves as the object for the eyepiece, which forms a magnified virtual image that is observed by
    the eye. This design is what Galileo used to observe the heavens.

    Although the arrangement of the lenses in a refracting telescope looks similar to that in a microscope, there
    are important differences. In a telescope, the real object is far away and the intermediate image is smaller than
    the object. In a microscope, the real object is very close and the intermediate image is larger than the object. In
    both the telescope and the microscope, the eyepiece magnifies the intermediate image; in the telescope,
    however, this is the only magnification.

    The most common two-lens telescope is shown in part (b) of the figure. The object is so far from the telescope

    that it is essentially at infinity compared with the focal lengths of the lenses  , so the incoming rays

    are essentially parallel and focus on the focal plane. Thus, the first image is produced at                                  , as shown

    in the figure, and is not large compared with what you might see by looking directly at the object. However, the

    eyepiece of the telescope eyepiece (like the microscope eyepiece) allows you to get nearer than your near point

    to this first image and so magnifies it (because you are near to it, it subtends a larger angle from your eye and

    so forms a larger image on your retina). As for a simple magnifier, the angular magnification of a telescope is

    the ratio of the angle subtended by the image [  in part (b)] to the angle subtended by the real object

    [  in part (b)]:

                                                                                                                                 2.39

    To obtain an expression for the magnification that involves only the lens parameters, note that the focal plane
    of the objective lens lies very close to the focal plan of the eyepiece. If we assume that these planes are
    superposed, we have the situation shown in Figure 2.41.

    Figure 2.41 The focal plane of the objective lens of a telescope is very near to the focal plane of the eyepiece. The angle

    subtended by the image viewed through the eyepiece is larger than the angle  subtended by the object when viewed with the

    unaided eye.

    We further assume that the angles         and    are small, so that the small-angle approximation holds

    (  ). If the image formed at the focal plane has height h, then

    where the minus sign is introduced because the height is negative if we measure both angles in the

counterclockwise direction. Inserting these expressions into Equation 2.39 gives

                                                                                  2.40

Thus, to obtain the greatest angular magnification, it is best to have an objective with a long focal length and an

eyepiece with a short focal length. The greater the angular magnification M, the larger an object will appear

when viewed through a telescope, making more details visible. Limits to observable details are imposed by

many factors, including lens quality and atmospheric disturbance. Typical eyepieces have focal lengths of 2.5

cm or 1.25 cm. If the objective of the telescope has a focal length of 1 meter, then these eyepieces result in

magnifications of  and  , respectively. Thus, the angular magnifications make the image appear 40

times or 80 times closer than the real object.

The minus sign in the magnification indicates the image is inverted, which is unimportant for observing the
stars but is a real problem for other applications, such as telescopes on ships or telescopic gun sights. If an
upright image is needed, Galileo's arrangement in part (a) of Figure 2.40 can be used. But a more common
arrangement is to use a third convex lens as an eyepiece, increasing the distance between the first two and
inverting the image once again, as seen in Figure 2.42.

Figure 2.42 This arrangement of three lenses in a telescope produces an upright final image. The first two lenses are far enough apart
that the second lens inverts the image of the first. The third lens acts as a magnifier and keeps the image upright and in a location that is
easy to view.

The largest refracting telescope in the world is the 40-inch diameter Yerkes telescope located at Lake Geneva,
Wisconsin (Figure 2.43), and operated by the University of Chicago.

It is very difficult and expensive to build large refracting telescopes. You need large defect-free lenses, which in
itself is a technically demanding task. A refracting telescope basically looks like a tube with a support
structure to rotate it in different directions. A refracting telescope suffers from several problems. The
aberration of lenses causes the image to be blurred. Also, as the lenses become thicker for larger lenses, more
light is absorbed, making faint stars more difficult to observe. Large lenses are also very heavy and deform
under their own weight. Some of these problems with refracting telescopes are addressed by avoiding
refraction for collecting light and instead using a curved mirror in its place, as devised by Isaac Newton. These
telescopes are called reflecting telescopes.

    Figure 2.43 In 1897, the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin (USA) built a large refracting telescope with an objective lens that is 40 inches
    in diameter and has a tube length of 62 feet. (credit: Yerkes Observatory, University of Chicago)

    Reflecting Telescopes

    Isaac Newton designed the first reflecting telescope around 1670 to solve the problem of chromatic aberration
    that happens in all refracting telescopes. In chromatic aberration, light of different colors refracts by slightly
    different amounts in the lens. As a result, a rainbow appears around the image and the image appears blurred.
    In the reflecting telescope, light rays from a distant source fall upon the surface of a concave mirror fixed at the
    bottom end of the tube. The use of a mirror instead of a lens eliminates chromatic aberration. The concave
    mirror focuses the rays on its focal plane. The design problem is how to observe the focused image. Newton
    used a design in which the focused light from the concave mirror was reflected to one side of the tube into an
    eyepiece [part (a) of Figure 2.44]. This arrangement is common in many amateur telescopes and is called the
    Newtonian design.
    Some telescopes reflect the light back toward the middle of the concave mirror using a convex mirror. In this
    arrangement, the light-gathering concave mirror has a hole in the middle [part (b) of the figure]. The light then
    is incident on an eyepiece lens. This arrangement of the objective and eyepiece is called the Cassegrain
    design. Most big telescopes, including the Hubble space telescope, are of this design. Other arrangements are
    also possible. In some telescopes, a light detector is placed right at the spot where light is focused by the
    curved mirror.

    Figure 2.44 Reflecting telescopes: (a) In the Newtonian design, the eyepiece is located at the side of the telescope; (b) in the Cassegrain
    design, the eyepiece is located past a hole in the primary mirror.

    Most astronomical research telescopes are now of the reflecting type. One of the earliest large telescopes of

this kind is the Hale 200-inch (or 5-meter) telescope built on Mount Palomar in southern California, which has
a 200 inch-diameter mirror. One of the largest telescopes in the world is the 10-meter Keck telescope at the
Keck Observatory on the summit of the dormant Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii. The Keck Observatory operates
two 10-meter telescopes. Each is not a single mirror, but is instead made up of 36 hexagonal mirrors.
Furthermore, the two telescopes on the Keck can work together, which increases their power to an effective
85-meter mirror. The Hubble telescope (Figure 2.45) is another large reflecting telescope with a 2.4 meter-
diameter primary mirror. The Hubble was put into orbit around Earth in 1990.

The angular magnification M of a reflecting telescope is also given by Equation 2.36. For a spherical mirror, the
focal length is half the radius of curvature, so making a large objective mirror not only helps the telescope
collect more light but also increases the magnification of the image.

pigmentation but are the result of light interference, which enhances specific wavelengths for a given thickness of
the film.

INTRODUCTION The most certain indication of a wave is interference. This wave characteristic is most
prominent when the wave interacts with an object that is not large compared with the wavelength. Interference
is observed for water waves, sound waves, light waves, and, in fact, all types of waves.
If you have ever looked at the reds, blues, and greens in a sunlit soap bubble and wondered how straw-colored
soapy water could produce them, you have hit upon one of the many phenomena that can only be explained by
the wave character of light (see Figure 3.1). The same is true for the colors seen in an oil slick or in the light
reflected from a DVD disc. These and other interesting phenomena cannot be explained fully by geometric
optics. In these cases, light interacts with objects and exhibits wave characteristics. The branch of optics that
considers the behavior of light when it exhibits wave characteristics is called wave optics (sometimes called
physical optics). It is the topic of this chapter.

 · Explain the phenomenon of interference
 · Define constructive and destructive interference for a double slit
The Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) thought that light was a wave, but Isaac Newton did not.
114  3 · Interference

     Newton thought that there were other explanations for color, and for the interference and diffraction effects
     that were observable at the time. Owing to Newton's tremendous reputation, his view generally prevailed; the
     fact that Huygens's principle worked was not considered direct evidence proving that light is a wave. The
     acceptance of the wave character of light came many years later in 1801, when the English physicist and
     physician Thomas Young (1773-1829) demonstrated optical interference with his now-classic double-slit
     experiment.

     If there were not one but two sources of waves, the waves could be made to interfere, as in the case of waves on
     water (Figure 3.2). If light is an electromagnetic wave, it must therefore exhibit interference effects under
     appropriate circumstances. In Young's experiment, sunlight was passed through a pinhole on a board. The
     emerging beam fell on two pinholes on a second board. The light emanating from the two pinholes then fell on
     a screen where a pattern of bright and dark spots was observed. This pattern, called fringes, can only be
     explained through interference, a wave phenomenon.

     Figure 3.2 Photograph of an interference pattern produced by circular water waves in a ripple tank. Two thin plungers are vibrated up and
     down in phase at the surface of the water. Circular water waves are produced by and emanate from each plunger.

     We can analyze double-slit interference with the help of Figure 3.3, which depicts an apparatus analogous to

     Young's. Light from a monochromatic source falls on a slit . The light emanating from is incident on two

     other slits and that are equidistant from . A pattern of interference fringes on the screen is then

     produced by the light emanating from and . All slits are assumed to be so narrow that they can be

     considered secondary point sources for Huygens' wavelets (The Nature of Light). Slits and are a distance

     d apart (         ), and the distance between the screen and the slits is  , which is much greater than

     d.

wavelets from slits and are observed on the screen.

Since is assumed to be a point source of monochromatic light, the secondary Huygens wavelets leaving
and always maintain a constant phase difference (zero in this case because and are equidistant from

   ) and have the same frequency. The sources and are then said to be coherent. By coherent waves, we
mean the waves are in phase or have a definite phase relationship. The term incoherent means the waves have
random phase relationships, which would be the case if and were illuminated by two independent light
sources, rather than a single source . Two independent light sources (which may be two separate areas
within the same lamp or the Sun) would generally not emit their light in unison, that is, not coherently. Also,
because and are the same distance from , the amplitudes of the two Huygens wavelets are equal.
Young used sunlight, where each wavelength forms its own pattern, making the effect more difficult to see. In
the following discussion, we illustrate the double-slit experiment with monochromatic light (single ) to
clarify the effect. Figure 3.4 shows the pure constructive and destructive interference of two waves having the
same wavelength and amplitude.

Figure 3.4 The amplitudes of waves add. (a) Pure constructive interference is obtained when identical waves are in phase. (b) Pure
destructive interference occurs when identical waves are exactly out of phase, or shifted by half a wavelength.

When light passes through narrow slits, the slits act as sources of coherent waves and light spreads out as
116  3 · Interference

     semicircular waves, as shown in Figure 3.5(a). Pure constructive interference occurs where the waves are crest
     to crest or trough to trough. Pure destructive interference occurs where they are crest to trough. The light must
     fall on a screen and be scattered into our eyes for us to see the pattern. An analogous pattern for water waves is
     shown in Figure 3.2. Note that regions of constructive and destructive interference move out from the slits at
     well-defined angles to the original beam. These angles depend on wavelength and the distance between the
     slits, as we shall see below.

     Figure 3.5 Double slits produce two coherent sources of waves that interfere. (a) Light spreads out (diffracts) from each slit, because the
     slits are narrow. These waves overlap and interfere constructively (bright lines) and destructively (dark regions). We can only see this if the
     light falls onto a screen and is scattered into our eyes. (b) When light that has passed through double slits falls on a screen, we see a
     pattern such as this.

     To understand the double-slit interference pattern, consider how two waves travel from the slits to the screen
     (Figure 3.6). Each slit is a different distance from a given point on the screen. Thus, different numbers of
     wavelengths fit into each path. Waves start out from the slits in phase (crest to crest), but they may end up out
     of phase (crest to trough) at the screen if the paths differ in length by half a wavelength, interfering
     destructively. If the paths differ by a whole wavelength, then the waves arrive in phase (crest to crest) at the
     screen, interfering constructively. More generally, if the path length difference between the two waves is
     any half-integral number of wavelengths [(1 / 2) , (3 / 2) , (5 / 2) , etc.], then destructive interference occurs.
     Similarly, if the path length difference is any integral number of wavelengths ( , 2 , 3 , etc.), then constructive
     interference occurs. These conditions can be expressed as equations:

                                                                                                                                                            3.1

Figure 3.6 Waves follow different paths from the slits to a common point P on a screen. Destructive interference occurs where one path is
a half wavelength longer than the other--the waves start in phase but arrive out of phase. Constructive interference occurs where one path
is a whole wavelength longer than the other--the waves start out and arrive in phase.

3.2 Mathematics of Interference

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Determine the angles for bright and dark fringes for double slit interference
 · Calculate the positions of bright fringes on a screen

Figure 3.7(a) shows how to determine the path length difference for waves traveling from two slits to a
common point on a screen. If the screen is a large distance away compared with the distance between the slits,
then the angle between the path and a line from the slits to the screen [part (b)] is nearly the same for each
path. In other words, and are essentially parallel. The lengths of and differ by , as indicated by the
two dashed lines in the figure. Simple trigonometry shows

                                                                                                                                                       3.3

where d is the distance between the slits. Combining this result with Equation 3.1, we obtain constructive
interference for a double slit when the path length difference is an integral multiple of the wavelength, or

                                                                                                                                                       3.4

Similarly, to obtain destructive interference for a double slit, the path length difference must be a half-integral
multiple of the wavelength, or

                                                                                                           3.5

where is the wavelength of the light, d is the distance between slits, and is the angle from the original

direction of the beam as discussed above. We call m the order of the interference. For example,  is

fourth-order interference.
118  3 · Interference

     Figure 3.7 (a) To reach P, the light waves from and must travel different distances. (b) The path difference between the two rays is
        .

     The equations for double-slit interference imply that a series of bright and dark lines are formed. For vertical
     slits, the light spreads out horizontally on either side of the incident beam into a pattern called interference
     fringes (Figure 3.8). The closer the slits are, the more the bright fringes spread apart. We can see this by
     examining the equation

                                                         . For fixed and m, the smaller d is, the larger must be, since
                       . This is consistent with our contention that wave effects are most noticeable when the object the
     wave encounters (here, slits a distance d apart) is small. Small d gives large , hence, a large effect.

     Referring back to part (a) of the figure, is typically small enough that  , where is the

Figure 3.8 The interference pattern for a double slit has an intensity that falls off with angle. The image shows multiple bright and dark
lines, or fringes, formed by light passing through a double slit.

EXAMPLE 3.1

Finding a Wavelength from an Interference Pattern

Suppose you pass light from a He-Ne laser through two slits separated by 0.0100 mm and find that the third

bright line on a screen is formed at an angle of   relative to the incident beam. What is the wavelength of

the light?

Strategy

The phenomenon is two-slit interference as illustrated in Figure 3.8 and the third bright line is due to third-

order constructive interference, which means that  . We are given  and             . The

wavelength can thus be found using the equation    for constructive interference.

Solution    for the wavelength gives
Solving

Substituting known values yields

Significance

To three digits, this is the wavelength of light emitted by the common He-Ne laser. Not by coincidence, this red
color is similar to that emitted by neon lights. More important, however, is the fact that interference patterns
can be used to measure wavelength. Young did this for visible wavelengths. This analytical techinque is still
widely used to measure electromagnetic spectra. For a given order, the angle for constructive interference
increases with , so that spectra (measurements of intensity versus wavelength) can be obtained.

     EXAMPLE 3.2

     Calculating the Highest Order Possible

     Interference patterns do not have an infinite number of lines, since there is a limit to how big m can be. What is
     the highest-order constructive interference possible with the system described in the preceding example?

     Strategy

     The equation                   (for                  ) describes constructive interference from two slits. For

     fixed values of       , the larger m is, the larger  is. However, the maximum value that          can have is 1,

     for an angle of . (Larger angles imply that light goes backward and does not reach the screen at all.) Let us

     find what value of m corresponds to this maximum diffraction angle.

     Solution                             for m gives
     Solving the equation

     Taking             and substituting the values of    from the preceding example gives

     Therefore, the largest integer m can be is 15, or    .

     Significance

     The number of fringes depends on the wavelength and slit separation. The number of fringes is very large for
     large slit separations. However, recall (see The Propagation of Light and the introduction for this chapter) that
     wave interference is only prominent when the wave interacts with objects that are not large compared to the
     wavelength. Therefore, if the slit separation and the sizes of the slits become much greater than the
     wavelength, the intensity pattern of light on the screen changes, so there are simply two bright lines cast by the
     slits, as expected, when light behaves like rays. We also note that the fringes get fainter farther away from the
     center. Consequently, not all 15 fringes may be observable.

      · Describe the locations and intensities of secondary maxima for multiple-slit interference

     Analyzing the interference of light passing through two slits lays out the theoretical framework of interference

     and gives us a historical insight into Thomas Young's experiments. However, much of the modern-day

     application of slit interference uses not just two slits but many, approaching infinity for practical purposes.

     The key optical element is called a diffraction grating, an important tool in optical analysis, which we discuss

     in detail in Diffraction. Here, we start the analysis of multiple-slit interference by taking the results from our

     analysis of the double slit (        ) and extending it to configurations with three, four, and much larger

     numbers of slits.

     Figure 3.9 shows the simplest case of multiple-slit interference, with three slits, or            . The spacing

     between slits is d, and the path length difference between adjacent slits is  , same as the case for the

     double slit. What is new is that the path length difference for the first and the third slits is  . The

condition for constructive interference is the same as for the double slit, that is

When this condition is met,  is automatically a multiple of , so all three rays combine constructively,

and the bright fringes that occur here are called principal maxima. But what happens when the path length

difference between adjacent slits is only ? We can think of the first and second rays as interfering

destructively, but the third ray remains unaltered. Instead of obtaining a dark fringe, or a minimum, as we did

for the double slit, we see a secondary maximum with intensity lower than the principal maxima.

Figure 3.9 Interference with three slits. Different pairs of emerging rays can combine constructively or destructively at the same time,
leading to secondary maxima.

In general, for N slits, these secondary maxima occur whenever an unpaired ray is present that does not go

away due to destructive interference. This occurs at  evenly spaced positions between the principal

maxima. The amplitude of the electromagnetic wave is correspondingly diminished to of the wave at the

principal maxima, and the light intensity, being proportional to the square of the wave amplitude, is

diminished to  of the intensity compared to the principal maxima. As Figure 3.10 shows, a dark fringe is

located between every maximum (principal or secondary). As N grows larger and the number of bright and

dark fringes increase, the widths of the maxima become narrower due to the closely located neighboring dark

fringes. Because the total amount of light energy remains unaltered, narrower maxima require that each

maximum reaches a correspondingly higher intensity.

     3.4 Interference in Thin Films

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe the phase changes that occur upon reflection
      · Describe fringes established by reflected rays of a common source
      · Explain the appearance of colors in thin films

     The bright colors seen in an oil slick floating on water or in a sunlit soap bubble are caused by interference.
     The brightest colors are those that interfere constructively. This interference is between light reflected from
     different surfaces of a thin film; thus, the effect is known as thin-film interference.

     As we noted before, interference effects are most prominent when light interacts with something having a size
     similar to its wavelength. A thin film is one having a thickness t smaller than a few times the wavelength of
     light, . Since color is associated indirectly with and because all interference depends in some way on the
     ratio of to the size of the object involved, we should expect to see different colors for different thicknesses of a
     film, as in Figure 3.11.

                          Figure 3.11 These soap bubbles exhibit brilliant colors when exposed to sunlight. (credit: Scott Robinson)

     What causes thin-film interference? Figure 3.12 shows how light reflected from the top and bottom surfaces of
     a film can interfere. Incident light is only partially reflected from the top surface of the film (ray 1). The
     remainder enters the film and is itself partially reflected from the bottom surface. Part of the light reflected
     from the bottom surface can emerge from the top of the film (ray 2) and interfere with light reflected from the
     top (ray 1). The ray that enters the film travels a greater distance, so it may be in or out of phase with the ray
     reflected from the top. However, consider for a moment, again, the bubbles in Figure 3.11. The bubbles are
     darkest where they are thinnest. Furthermore, if you observe a soap bubble carefully, you will note it gets dark
     at the point where it breaks. For very thin films, the difference in path lengths of rays 1 and 2 in Figure 3.12 is
     negligible, so why should they interfere destructively and not constructively? The answer is that a phase
     change can occur upon reflection, as discussed next.

Figure 3.12 Light striking a thin film is partially reflected (ray 1) and partially refracted at the top surface. The refracted ray is partially
reflected at the bottom surface and emerges as ray 2. These rays interfere in a way that depends on the thickness of the film and the
indices of refraction of the various media.

Changes in Phase due to Reflection

We saw earlier (Waves) that reflection of mechanical waves can involve a                           phase change. For example, a

traveling wave on a string is inverted (i.e., a  phase change) upon reflection at a boundary to which a

heavier string is tied. However, if the second string is lighter (or more precisely, of a lower linear density), no

inversion occurs. Light waves produce the same effect, but the deciding parameter for light is the index of

refraction. Light waves undergo a  or radians phase change upon reflection at an interface beyond which

is a medium of higher index of refraction. No phase change takes place when reflecting from a medium of

lower refractive index (Figure 3.13). Because of the periodic nature of waves, this phase change or inversion is

equivalent to  in distance travelled, or path length. Both the path length and refractive indices are

important factors in thin-film interference.

Figure 3.13 Reflection at an interface for light traveling from a medium with index of refraction  to a medium with index of refraction

,  , causes the phase of the wave to change by radians.

If the film in Figure 3.12 is a soap bubble (essentially water with air on both sides), then a phase shift of
occurs for ray 1 but not for ray 2. Thus, when the film is very thin and the path length difference between the
two rays is negligible, they are exactly out of phase, and destructive interference occurs at all wavelengths.
Thus, the soap bubble is dark here. The thickness of the film relative to the wavelength of light is the other
124  3 · Interference

     crucial factor in thin-film interference. Ray 2 in Figure 3.12 travels a greater distance than ray 1. For light

     incident perpendicular to the surface, ray 2 travels a distance approximately 2t farther than ray 1. When this

     distance is an integral or half-integral multiple of the wavelength in the medium  , where is the

     wavelength in vacuum and n is the index of refraction), constructive or destructive interference occurs,

     depending also on whether there is a phase change in either ray.

     EXAMPLE 3.3

     Calculating the Thickness of a Nonreflective Lens Coating

     Sophisticated cameras use a series of several lenses. Light can reflect from the surfaces of these various lenses
     and degrade image clarity. To limit these reflections, lenses are coated with a thin layer of magnesium fluoride,
     which causes destructive thin-film interference. What is the thinnest this film can be, if its index of refraction
     is 1.38 and it is designed to limit the reflection of 550-nm light, normally the most intense visible wavelength?
     Assume the index of refraction of the glass is 1.52.

     Strategy

     Refer to Figure 3.12 and use      for air,           , and        . Both ray 1 and ray 2 have a shift

     upon reflection. Thus, to obtain destructive interference, ray 2 needs to travel a half wavelength farther than

     ray 1. For rays incident perpendicularly, the path length difference is 2t.

     Solution
     To obtain destructive interference here,

     where is the wavelength in the film and is given by               . Thus,

     Solving for t and entering known values yields

     Significance
     Films such as the one in this example are most effective in producing destructive interference when the
     thinnest layer is used, since light over a broader range of incident angles is reduced in intensity. These films
     are called nonreflective coatings; this is only an approximately correct description, though, since other
     wavelengths are only partially cancelled. Nonreflective coatings are also used in car windows and sunglasses.

     Combining Path Length Difference with Phase Change

     Thin-film interference is most constructive or most destructive when the path length difference for the two
     rays is an integral or half-integral wavelength. That is, for rays incident perpendicularly,

     To know whether interference is constructive or destructive, you must also determine if there is a phase
     change upon reflection. Thin-film interference thus depends on film thickness, the wavelength of light, and the
     refractive indices. For white light incident on a film that varies in thickness, you can observe rainbow colors of
     constructive interference for various wavelengths as the thickness varies.

light with a wavelength of 650 nm? The index of refraction of soap is taken to be the same as that of water. (b)
What three smallest thicknesses give destructive interference?

Strategy

Use Figure 3.12 to visualize the bubble, which acts as a thin film between two layers of air. Thus

for air, and         for soap (equivalent to water). There is a shift for ray 1 reflected from the top surface

of the bubble and no shift for ray 2 reflected from the bottom surface. To get constructive interference, then,

the path length difference (2t) must be a half-integral multiple of the wavelength--the first three being

              , and  . To get destructive interference, the path length difference must be an integral multiple

of the wavelength--the first three being 0, , and .

Solution

interference is

Substituting known values gives

Significance

increases in thickness. First would be a dark band at 0 thickness, then bright at 122 nm thickness, then dark at
244 nm, bright at 366 nm, dark at 488 nm, and bright at 610 nm. If the bubble varied smoothly in thickness,

     The slides are very flat, so that the wedge of air between them increases in thickness very uniformly. A phase
     change occurs at the second surface but not the first, so a dark band forms where the slides touch. The
     rainbow colors of constructive interference repeat, going from violet to red again and again as the distance
     between the slides increases. As the layer of air increases, the bands become more difficult to see, because
     slight changes in incident angle have greater effects on path length differences. If monochromatic light instead
     of white light is used, then bright and dark bands are obtained rather than repeating rainbow colors.

     Figure 3.14 (a) The rainbow-color bands are produced by thin-film interference in the air between the two glass slides. (b) Schematic of
     the paths taken by rays in the wedge of air between the slides. (c) If the air wedge is illuminated with monochromatic light, bright and dark
     bands are obtained rather than repeating rainbow colors.

     An important application of thin-film interference is found in the manufacturing of optical instruments. A lens
     or mirror can be compared with a master as it is being ground, allowing it to be shaped to an accuracy of less
     than a wavelength over its entire surface. Figure 3.15 illustrates the phenomenon called Newton's rings,
     which occurs when the plane surfaces of two lenses are placed together. (The circular bands are called
     Newton's rings because Isaac Newton described them and their use in detail. Newton did not discover them;
     Robert Hooke did, and Newton did not believe they were due to the wave character of light.) Each successive
     ring of a given color indicates an increase of only half a wavelength in the distance between the lens and the
     blank, so that great precision can be obtained. Once the lens is perfect, no rings appear.

Figure 3.15 "Newton's rings" interference fringes are produced when two plano-convex lenses are placed together with their plane

surfaces in contact. The rings are created by interference between the light reflected off the two surfaces as a result of a slight gap between

them, indicating that these surfaces are not precisely plane but are slightly convex. (credit: Ulf Seifert)

Thin-film interference has many other applications, both in nature and in manufacturing. The wings of certain
moths and butterflies have nearly iridescent colors due to thin-film interference. In addition to pigmentation,
the wing's color is affected greatly by constructive interference of certain wavelengths reflected from its film-
coated surface. Some car manufacturers offer special paint jobs that use thin-film interference to produce
colors that change with angle. This expensive option is based on variation of thin-film path length differences
with angle. Security features on credit cards, banknotes, driving licenses, and similar items prone to forgery
use thin-film interference, diffraction gratings, or holograms. As early as 1998, Australia led the way with
dollar bills printed on polymer with a diffraction grating security feature, making the currency difficult to
forge. Other countries, such as Canada, New Zealand, and Taiwan, are using similar technologies, while US
currency includes a thin-film interference effect.

3.5 The Michelson Interferometer

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Explain changes in fringes observed with a Michelson interferometer caused by mirror movements
 · Explain changes in fringes observed with a Michelson interferometer caused by changes in medium

The Michelson interferometer (invented by the American physicist Albert A. Michelson, 1852-1931) is a
precision instrument that produces interference fringes by splitting a light beam into two parts and then
recombining them after they have traveled different optical paths. Figure 3.16 depicts the interferometer and
the path of a light beam from a single point on the extended source S, which is a ground-glass plate that
diffuses the light from a monochromatic lamp of wavelength . The beam strikes the half-silvered mirror M,
where half of it is reflected to the side and half passes through the mirror. The reflected light travels to the
movable plane mirror , where it is reflected back through M to the observer. The transmitted half of the
original beam is reflected back by the stationary mirror and then toward the observer by M.

     Figure 3.16 (a) The Michelson interferometer. The extended light source is a ground-glass plate that diffuses the light from a laser. (b) A
     planar view of the interferometer.

     Because both beams originate from the same point on the source, they are coherent and therefore interfere.
     Notice from the figure that one beam passes through M three times and the other only once. To ensure that
     both beams traverse the same thickness of glass, a compensator plate C of transparent glass is placed in the
     arm containing . This plate is a duplicate of M (without the silvering) and is usually cut from the same piece
     of glass used to produce M. With the compensator in place, any phase difference between the two beams is due
     solely to the difference in the distances they travel.

     The path difference of the two beams when they recombine is  , where is the distance between M

     and , and is the distance between M and . Suppose this path difference is an integer number of

     wavelengths . Then, constructive interference occurs and a bright image of the point on the source is seen

     at the observer. Now the light from any other point on the source whose two beams have this same path

     difference also undergoes constructive interference and produces a bright image. The collection of these point

     images is a bright fringe corresponding to a path difference of (Figure 3.17). When is moved a

     distance          , this path difference changes by , and each fringe moves to the position previously

     occupied by an adjacent fringe. Consequently, by counting the number of fringes m passing a given point as

     is moved, an observer can measure minute displacements that are accurate to a fraction of a wavelength,

     as shown by the relation

                                                                                                                                3.7

     EXAMPLE 3.5

Precise Distance Measurements by Michelson Interferometer

A red laser light of wavelength 630 nm is used in a Michelson interferometer. While keeping the mirror
fixed, mirror is moved. The fringes are found to move past a fixed cross-hair in the viewer. Find the
distance the mirror is moved for a single fringe to move past the reference line.

Strategy
Refer to Figure 3.16 for the geometry. We use the result of the Michelson interferometer interference condition
to find the distance moved, .

For a 630-nm red laser light, and for each fringe crossing

Significance
An important application of this measurement is the definition of the standard meter. As mentioned in Units
and Measurement, the length of the standard meter was once defined as the mirror displacement in a
Michelson interferometer corresponding to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the particular fringe of krypton-86 in
a gas discharge tube.

        EXAMPLE 3.6

Measuring the Refractive Index of a Gas

In one arm of a Michelson interferometer, a glass chamber is placed with attachments for evacuating the inside
and putting gases in it. The space inside the container is 2 cm wide. Initially, the container is empty. As gas is
slowly let into the chamber, you observe that dark fringes move past a reference line in the field of observation.
By the time the chamber is filled to the desired pressure, you have counted 122 fringes move past the
reference line. The wavelength of the light used is 632.8 nm. What is the refractive index of this gas?

Strategy

The       fringes observed compose the difference between the number of wavelengths that fit within the

empty chamber (vacuum) and the number of wavelengths that fit within the same chamber when it is gas-

filled. The wavelength in the filled chamber is shorter by a factor of n, the index of refraction.
130  3 · Interference

     Solution

     The ray travels a distance            to the right through the glass chamber and another distance t to the left

     upon reflection. The total travel is  . When empty, the number of wavelengths that fit in this chamber is

     where                      is the wavelength in vacuum of the light used. In any other medium, the wavelength is
               and the number of wavelengths that fit in the gas-filled chamber is

     The number of fringes observed in the transition is

     Solving for          gives

     and               .

     Significance

     The indices of refraction for gases are so close to that of vacuum, that we normally consider them equal to 1.
     The difference between 1 and 1.0019 is so small that measuring it requires a correspondingly sensitive
     technique such as interferometry. We cannot, for example, hope to measure this value using techniques based
     simply on Snell's law.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 3.3

     Although m, the number of fringes observed, is an integer, which is often regarded as having zero uncertainty,

     in practical terms, it is all too easy to lose track when counting fringes. In Example 3.6, if you estimate that you

     might have missed as many as five fringes when you reported  fringes, (a) is the value for the index of

     refraction worked out in Example 3.6 too large or too small? (b) By how much?

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Wave Optics

     Step 1. Examine the situation to determine that interference is involved. Identify whether slits, thin films, or
     interferometers are considered in the problem.

     Step 2. If slits are involved, note that diffraction gratings and double slits produce very similar interference
     patterns, but that gratings have narrower (sharper) maxima. Single-slit patterns are characterized by a large
     central maximum and smaller maxima to the sides.

     Step 3. If thin-film interference or an interferometer is involved, take note of the path length difference
     between the two rays that interfere. Be certain to use the wavelength in the medium involved, since it differs
     from the wavelength in vacuum. Note also that there is an additional phase shift when light reflects from a
     medium with a greater index of refraction.

     Step 4. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is

useful. Draw a diagram of the situation. Labeling the diagram is useful.

Step 5. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).

Step 6. Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown) and enter the knowns.
Slits, gratings, and the Rayleigh limit involve equations.

Step 7. For thin-film interference, you have constructive interference for a total shift that is an integral number
of wavelengths. You have destructive interference for a total shift of a half-integral number of wavelengths.
Always keep in mind that crest to crest is constructive whereas crest to trough is destructive.

Step 8. Check to see if the answer is reasonable: Does it make sense? Angles in interference patterns cannot be
greater than , for example.

Diffraction

Figure 4.1 A steel ball bearing illuminated by a laser does not cast a sharp, circular shadow. Instead, a series of
diffraction fringes and a central bright spot are observed. Known as Poisson's spot, the effect was first predicted by
Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788-1827) as a consequence of diffraction of light waves. Based on principles of ray
optics, Siméon-Denis Poisson (1781-1840) argued against Fresnel's prediction. (credit: modification of work by

INTRODUCTION Imagine passing a monochromatic light beam through a narrow opening--a slit just a little
wider than the wavelength of the light. Instead of a simple shadow of the slit on the screen, you will see that an
interference pattern appears, even though there is only one slit.
In the chapter on interference, we saw that you need two sources of waves for interference to occur. How can
142  4 · Diffraction

     there be an interference pattern when we have only one slit? In The Nature of Light, we learned that, due to
     Huygens's principle, we can imagine a wave front as equivalent to infinitely many point sources of waves.
     Thus, a wave from a slit can behave not as one wave but as an infinite number of point sources. These waves
     can interfere with each other, resulting in an interference pattern without the presence of a second slit. This
     phenomenon is called diffraction.

     Another way to view this is to recognize that a slit has a small but finite width. In the preceding chapter, we
     implicitly regarded slits as objects with positions but no size. The widths of the slits were considered
     negligible. When the slits have finite widths, each point along the opening can be considered a point source of
     light--a foundation of Huygens's principle. Because real-world optical instruments must have finite apertures
     (otherwise, no light can enter), diffraction plays a major role in the way we interpret the output of these optical
     instruments. For example, diffraction places limits on our ability to resolve images or objects. This is a
     problem that we will study later in this chapter.

     4.1 Single-Slit Diffraction

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Explain the phenomenon of diffraction and the conditions under which it is observed
      · Describe diffraction through a single slit

     After passing through a narrow aperture (opening), a wave propagating in a specific direction tends to spread
     out. For example, sound waves that enter a room through an open door can be heard even if the listener is in a
     part of the room where the geometry of ray propagation dictates that there should only be silence. Similarly,
     ocean waves passing through an opening in a breakwater can spread throughout the bay inside. (Figure 4.2).
     The spreading and bending of sound and ocean waves are two examples of diffraction, which is the bending of
     a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle--a phenomenon exhibited by all types of waves.

     Figure 4.2 Because of the diffraction of waves, ocean waves entering through an opening in a breakwater can spread throughout the bay.
     (credit: modification of map data from Google Earth)

     The diffraction of sound waves is apparent to us because wavelengths in the audible region are approximately
     the same size as the objects they encounter, a condition that must be satisfied if diffraction effects are to be
     observed easily. Since the wavelengths of visible light range from approximately 390 to 770 nm, most objects
     do not diffract light significantly. However, situations do occur in which apertures are small enough that the
     diffraction of light is observable. For example, if you place your middle and index fingers close together and
     look through the opening at a light bulb, you can see a rather clear diffraction pattern, consisting of light and
     dark lines running parallel to your fingers.

     Diffraction through a Single Slit

     Light passing through a single slit forms a diffraction pattern somewhat different from those formed by double
     slits or diffraction gratings, which we discussed in the chapter on interference. Figure 4.3 shows a single-slit
     diffraction pattern. Note that the central maximum is larger than maxima on either side and that the intensity

decreases rapidly on either side. In contrast, a diffraction grating (Diffraction Gratings) produces evenly
spaced lines that dim slowly on either side of the center.

Figure 4.3 Single-slit diffraction pattern. (a) Monochromatic light passing through a single slit has a central maximum and many smaller

and dimmer maxima on either side. The central maximum is six times higher than shown. (b) The diagram shows the bright central

maximum, and the dimmer and thinner maxima on either side.

The analysis of single-slit diffraction is illustrated in Figure 4.4. Here, the light arrives at the slit, illuminating it
uniformly and is in phase across its width. We then consider light propagating onwards from different parts of
the same slit. According to Huygens's principle, every part of the wave front in the slit emits wavelets, as we
discussed in The Nature of Light. These are like rays that start out in phase and head in all directions. (Each ray
is perpendicular to the wave front of a wavelet.) Assuming the screen is very far away compared with the size
of the slit, rays heading toward a common destination are nearly parallel. When they travel straight ahead, as
in part (a) of the figure, they remain in phase, and we observe a central maximum. However, when rays travel
at an angle relative to the original direction of the beam, each ray travels a different distance to a common
location, and they can arrive in or out of phase. In part (b), the ray from the bottom travels a distance of one
wavelength farther than the ray from the top. Thus, a ray from the center travels a distance less than the
one at the bottom edge of the slit, arrives out of phase, and interferes destructively. A ray from slightly above
the center and one from slightly above the bottom also cancel one another. In fact, each ray from the slit
interferes destructively with another ray. In other words, a pair-wise cancellation of all rays results in a dark
minimum in intensity at this angle. By symmetry, another minimum occurs at the same angle to the right of
the incident direction (toward the bottom of the figure) of the light.
144  4 · Diffraction

     Figure 4.4 Light passing through a single slit is diffracted in all directions and may interfere constructively or destructively, depending on
     the angle. The difference in path length for rays from either side of the slit is seen to be a sin .

     At the larger angle shown in part (c), the path lengths differ by  for rays from the top and bottom of the slit.

     One ray travels a distance different from the ray from the bottom and arrives in phase, interfering

     constructively. Two rays, each from slightly above those two, also add constructively. Most rays from the slit

     have another ray to interfere with constructively, and a maximum in intensity occurs at this angle. However,

     not all rays interfere constructively for this situation, so the maximum is not as intense as the central

     maximum. Finally, in part (d), the angle shown is large enough to produce a second minimum. As seen in the

     figure, the difference in path length for rays from either side of the slit is a sin , and we see that a destructive

     minimum is obtained when this distance is an integral multiple of the wavelength.

     Thus, to obtain destructive interference for a single slit,

                                                                                                                4.1

     where a is the slit width, is the light's wavelength, is the angle relative to the original direction of the light,
     and m is the order of the minimum. Figure 4.5 shows a graph of intensity for single-slit interference, and it is
     apparent that the maxima on either side of the central maximum are much less intense and not as wide. This
     effect is explored in Double-Slit Diffraction.

EXAMPLE 4.1

Calculating Single-Slit Diffraction

Visible light of wavelength 550 nm falls on a single slit and produces its second diffraction minimum at an

angle of  relative to the incident direction of the light, as in Figure 4.6. (a) What is the width of the slit? (b)

At what angle is the first minimum produced?

                      Figure 4.6 In this example, we analyze a graph of the single-slit diffraction pattern.

Strategy
From the given information, and assuming the screen is far away from the slit, we can use the equation

                  first to find D, and again to find the angle for the first minimum

     b. Solving the equation                 for  and substituting the known values gives

     Thus the angle is

     Significance

     We see that the slit is narrow (it is only a few times greater than the wavelength of light). This is consistent with

     the fact that light must interact with an object comparable in size to its wavelength in order to exhibit

     significant wave effects such as this single-slit diffraction pattern. We also see that the central maximum

     extends          on either side of the original beam, for a width of about . The angle between the first and

     second minima is only about                  . Thus, the second maximum is only about half as wide as the

     central maximum.

     Suppose the slit width in Example 4.1 is increased to               What are the new angular positions for

     the first, second, and third minima? Would a fourth minimum exist?

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Calculate the intensity relative to the central maximum of the single-slit diffraction peaks
      · Calculate the intensity relative to the central maximum of an arbitrary point on the screen

     To calculate the intensity of the diffraction pattern, we follow the phasor method used for calculations with ac

     circuits in Alternating-Current Circuits. If we consider that there are N Huygens sources across the slit shown

     in Figure 4.4, with each source separated by a distance a/N from its adjacent neighbors, the path difference

     between waves from adjacent sources reaching the arbitrary point P on the screen is              This distance

     is equivalent to a phase difference of                 The phasor diagram for the waves arriving at the point

     With         , the phasor diagram approaches a circular arc of length  and radius r. Since the length of

     the arc is       for any , the radius r of the arc must decrease as increases (or equivalently, as the phasors

     form tighter spirals).

     the first equation, we find

     This equation relates the amplitude of the resultant field at any point in the diffraction pattern to the

     amplitude        at the central maximum. The intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude, so

                                                                                                                      4.4

4.3 Double-Slit Diffraction

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Describe the combined effect of interference and diffraction with two slits, each with finite width
 · Determine the relative intensities of interference fringes within a diffraction pattern
 · Identify missing orders, if any

When we studied interference in Young's double-slit experiment, we ignored the diffraction effect in each slit.
We assumed that the slits were so narrow that on the screen you saw only the interference of light from just
two point sources. If the slit is smaller than the wavelength, then Figure 4.10(a) shows that there is just a
spreading of light and no peaks or troughs on the screen. Therefore, it was reasonable to leave out the
diffraction effect in that chapter. However, if you make the slit wider, Figure 4.10(b) and (c) show that you
cannot ignore diffraction. In this section, we study the complications to the double-slit experiment that arise
when you also need to take into account the diffraction effect of each slit.

To calculate the diffraction pattern for two (or any number of) slits, we need to generalize the method we just
used for a single slit. That is, across each slit, we place a uniform distribution of point sources that radiate
Huygens wavelets, and then we sum the wavelets from all the slits. This gives the intensity at any point on the
screen. Although the details of that calculation can be complicated, the final result is quite simple:

  Two-Slit Diffraction Pattern

  The diffraction pattern of two slits of width a that are separated by a distance d is the interference pattern
  of two point sources separated by d multiplied by the diffraction pattern of a slit of width a.

In other words, the locations of the interference fringes are given by the equation  , the same as

when we considered the slits to be point sources, but the intensities of the fringes are now reduced by

diffraction effects, according to Equation 4.4. [Note that in the chapter on interference, we wrote

and used the integer m to refer to interference fringes. Equation 4.1 also uses m, but this time to refer to

diffraction minima. If both equations are used simultaneously, it is good practice to use a different variable

(such as n) for one of these integers in order to keep them distinct.]

Interference and diffraction effects operate simultaneously and generally produce minima at different angles.
This gives rise to a complicated pattern on the screen, in which some of the maxima of interference from the
two slits are missing if the maximum of the interference is in the same direction as the minimum of the
diffraction. We refer to such a missing peak as a missing order. One example of a diffraction pattern on the
screen is shown in Figure 4.11. The solid line with multiple peaks of various heights is the intensity observed
on the screen. It is a product of the interference pattern of waves from separate slits and the diffraction of
waves from within one slit.
152  4 · Diffraction

     Figure 4.11 Diffraction from a double slit. The purple line with peaks of the same height are from the interference of the waves from two

     slits; the blue line with one big hump in the middle is the diffraction of waves from within one slit; and the thick red line is the product of the

     two, which is the pattern observed on the screen. The plot shows the expected result for a slit width  and slit separation   . The

     maximum of       order for the interference is missing because the minimum of the diffraction occurs in the same direction.

Significance

Note that this approach is relatively straightforward and gives a result that is almost exactly the same as the

more complicated analysis using phasors to work out the intensity values of the double-slit interference (thin

line in Figure 4.11). The phasor approach accounts for the downward slope in the diffraction intensity (blue

line) so that the peak near        occurs at a value of ever so slightly smaller than we have shown here.

Solution
From Equation 4.1, the angular position of the first diffraction minimum is

4.4 Diffraction Gratings

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Discuss the pattern obtained from diffraction gratings
 · Explain diffraction grating effects

Analyzing the interference of light passing through two slits lays out the theoretical framework of interference
and gives us a historical insight into Thomas Young's experiments. However, most modern-day applications of
slit interference use not just two slits but many, approaching infinity for practical purposes. The key optical
element is called a diffraction grating, an important tool in optical analysis.

Diffraction Gratings: An Infinite Number of Slits

The analysis of multi-slit interference in Interference allows us to consider what happens when the number of
154  4 · Diffraction

     slits N approaches infinity. Recall that  secondary maxima appear between the principal maxima. We can

     see there will be an infinite number of secondary maxima that appear, and an infinite number of dark fringes

     between them. This makes the spacing between the fringes, and therefore the width of the maxima,

     infinitesimally small. Furthermore, because the intensity of the secondary maxima is proportional to  , it

     approaches zero so that the secondary maxima are no longer seen. What remains are only the principal

     maxima, now very bright and very narrow (Figure 4.12).

     Figure 4.12 (a) Intensity of light transmitted through a large number of slits. When N approaches infinity, only the principal maxima
     remain as very bright and very narrow lines. (b) A laser beam passed through a diffraction grating. (credit b: modification of work by
     Sebastian Stapelberg)

     In reality, the number of slits is not infinite, but it can be very large--large enough to produce the equivalent
     effect. A prime example is an optical element called a diffraction grating. A diffraction grating can be
     manufactured by carving glass with a sharp tool in a large number of precisely positioned parallel lines, with
     untouched regions acting like slits (Figure 4.13). This type of grating can be photographically mass produced
     rather cheaply. Because there can be over 1000 lines per millimeter across the grating, when a section as small
     as a few millimeters is illuminated by an incoming ray, the number of illuminated slits is effectively infinite,
     providing for very sharp principal maxima.

Figure 4.13 A diffraction grating can be manufactured by carving glass with a sharp tool in a large number of precisely positioned parallel
lines.

Diffraction gratings work both for transmission of light, as in Figure 4.14, and for reflection of light, as on
butterfly wings and the Australian opal in Figure 4.15. Natural diffraction gratings also occur in the feathers of
certain birds such as the hummingbird. Tiny, finger-like structures in regular patterns act as reflection
gratings, producing constructive interference that gives the feathers colors not solely due to their
pigmentation. This is called iridescence.

angles. (b) The pattern obtained for white light incident on a grating. The central maximum is white, and the higher-order maxima disperse

     Applications of Diffraction Gratings

     Where are diffraction gratings used in applications? Diffraction gratings are commonly used for spectroscopic
     dispersion and analysis of light. What makes them particularly useful is the fact that they form a sharper
     pattern than double slits do. That is, their bright fringes are narrower and brighter while their dark regions are
     darker. Diffraction gratings are key components of monochromators used, for example, in optical imaging of
     particular wavelengths from biological or medical samples. A diffraction grating can be chosen to specifically
     analyze a wavelength emitted by molecules in diseased cells in a biopsy sample or to help excite strategic
     molecules in the sample with a selected wavelength of light. Another vital use is in optical fiber technologies
     where fibers are designed to provide optimum performance at specific wavelengths. A range of diffraction
     gratings are available for selecting wavelengths for such use.

             EXAMPLE 4.5

     Calculating Typical Diffraction Grating Effects

     of the shortest and longest wavelengths of visible light (380 and 760 nm, respectively). (b) What is the distance

Figure 4.16 (a) The diffraction grating considered in this example produces a rainbow of colors on a screen a distance  from

the grating. The distances along the screen are measured perpendicular to the x-direction. In other words, the rainbow pattern extends out

of the page.

(b) In a bird's-eye view, the rainbow pattern can be seen on a table where the equipment is placed.

Strategy
Once a value for the diffraction grating's slit spacing d has been determined, the angles for the sharp lines can
be found using the equation

Since there are 10,000 lines per centimeter, each line is separated by 1/10,000 of a centimeter. Once we know
the angles, we an find the distances along the screen by using simple trigonometry.

Solution

a. The distance between slits is                                                                     Let us call the two
     angles for violet (380 nm) and

           The distance between them is therefore

     Significance
     The large distance between the red and violet ends of the rainbow produced from the white light indicates the
     potential this diffraction grating has as a spectroscopic tool. The more it can spread out the wavelengths
     (greater dispersion), the more detail can be seen in a spectrum. This depends on the quality of the diffraction
     grating--it must be very precisely made in addition to having closely spaced lines.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 4.4

     If the line spacing of a diffraction grating d is not precisely known, we can use a light source with a well-

     determined wavelength to measure it. Suppose the first-order constructive fringe of the emission line of

     Take the same simulation (https://openstax.org/l/21doubslitdiff) we used for double-slit diffraction and try

     increasing the number of slits from  to                  . The primary peaks become sharper, and the

     secondary peaks become less and less pronounced. By the time you reach the maximum number of                   ,

     the system is behaving much like a diffraction grating.

     4.5 Circular Apertures and Resolution

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe the diffraction limit on resolution
      · Describe the diffraction limit on beam propagation

     Light diffracts as it moves through space, bending around obstacles, interfering constructively and
     destructively. This can be used as a spectroscopic tool--a diffraction grating disperses light according to
     wavelength, for example, and is used to produce spectra--but diffraction also limits the detail we can obtain in
     images.

     Figure 4.17(a) shows the effect of passing light through a small circular aperture. Instead of a bright spot with
     sharp edges, we obtain a spot with a fuzzy edge surrounded by circles of light. This pattern is caused by
     diffraction, similar to that produced by a single slit. Light from different parts of the circular aperture
     interferes constructively and destructively. The effect is most noticeable when the aperture is small, but the
     effect is there for large apertures as well.

Figure 4.17 (a) Monochromatic light passed through a small circular aperture produces this diffraction pattern. (b) Two point-light
sources that are close to one another produce overlapping images because of diffraction. (c) If the sources are closer together, they cannot
be distinguished or resolved.

How does diffraction affect the detail that can be observed when light passes through an aperture? Figure
4.17(b) shows the diffraction pattern produced by two point-light sources that are close to one another. The
pattern is similar to that for a single point source, and it is still possible to tell that there are two light sources
rather than one. If they are closer together, as in Figure 4.17(c), we cannot distinguish them, thus limiting the
detail or resolution we can obtain. This limit is an inescapable consequence of the wave nature of light.

Diffraction limits the resolution in many situations. The acuity of our vision is limited because light passes
through the pupil, which is the circular aperture of the eye. Be aware that the diffraction-like spreading of light
is due to the limited diameter of a light beam, not the interaction with an aperture. Thus, light passing through
a lens with a diameter D shows this effect and spreads, blurring the image, just as light passing through an
aperture of diameter D does. Thus, diffraction limits the resolution of any system having a lens or mirror.
Telescopes are also limited by diffraction, because of the finite diameter D of the primary mirror.

Just what is the limit? To answer that question, consider the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, which

has a central maximum that is wider and brighter than the maxima surrounding it (similar to a slit) (Figure

4.18(a)). It can be shown that, for a circular aperture of diameter D, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern

occurs at  (providing the aperture is large compared with the wavelength of light, which is the case

for most optical instruments). The accepted criterion for determining the diffraction limit to resolution based

on this angle is known as the Rayleigh criterion, which was developed by Lord Rayleigh in the nineteenth

century.

Rayleigh Criterion

The diffraction limit to resolution states that two images are just resolvable when the center of the
diffraction pattern of one is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other (Figure
4.18(b)).

The first minimum is at an angle of  , so that two point objects are just resolvable if they are
separated by the angle

                                                                                                               4.5

where is the wavelength of light (or other electromagnetic radiation) and D is the diameter of the aperture,
lens, mirror, etc., with which the two objects are observed. In this expression, has units of radians. This angle
is also commonly known as the diffraction limit.

     is wider and brighter than those to the sides. (b) Two point objects produce overlapping diffraction patterns. Shown here is the Rayleigh
     criterion for being just resolvable. The central maximum of one pattern lies on the first minimum of the other.

     All attempts to observe the size and shape of objects are limited by the wavelength of the probe. Even the small
     wavelength of light prohibits exact precision. When extremely small wavelength probes are used, as with an
     electron microscope, the system is disturbed, still limiting our knowledge. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
     asserts that this limit is fundamental and inescapable, as we shall see in the chapter on quantum mechanics.

     EXAMPLE 4.6

     Calculating Diffraction Limits of the Hubble Space Telescope

     The primary mirror of the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope has a diameter of 2.40 m. Being in orbit, this
     telescope avoids the degrading effects of atmospheric distortion on its resolution. (a) What is the angle
     between two just-resolvable point light sources (perhaps two stars)? Assume an average light wavelength of
     550 nm. (b) If these two stars are at a distance of 2 million light-years, which is the distance of the Andromeda
     Galaxy, how close together can they be and still be resolved? (A light-year, or ly, is the distance light travels in 1
     year.)

     Strategy

     The Rayleigh criterion stated in Equation 4.5,    , gives the smallest possible angle between point

     sources, or the best obtainable resolution. Once this angle is known, we can calculate the distance between the

     stars, since we are given how far away they are.

Significance

The angle found in part (a) is extraordinarily small (less than 1/50,000 of a degree), because the primary
mirror is so large compared with the wavelength of light. As noticed, diffraction effects are most noticeable
when light interacts with objects having sizes on the order of the wavelength of light. However, the effect is still
there, and there is a diffraction limit to what is observable. The actual resolution of the Hubble Telescope is not
quite as good as that found here. As with all instruments, there are other effects, such as nonuniformities in
mirrors or aberrations in lenses that further limit resolution. However, Figure 4.19 gives an indication of the
extent of the detail observable with the Hubble because of its size and quality, and especially because it is
above Earth's atmosphere.

The answer in part (b) indicates that two stars separated by about half a light-year can be resolved. The
average distance between stars in a galaxy is on the order of five light-years in the outer parts and about one
light-year near the galactic center. Therefore, the Hubble can resolve most of the individual stars in
Andromeda Galaxy, even though it lies at such a huge distance that its light takes 2 million years to reach us.

the largest curved focusing dish in the world. Although D for Arecibo is much larger than for the Hubble Telescope, it detects radiation of a
much longer wavelength and its diffraction limit is significantly poorer than Hubble's. The Arecibo telescope is still very useful, because
important information is carried by radio waves that is not carried by visible light. (credit: Jeff Hitchcock)

What is the angular resolution of the Arecibo telescope shown in Figure 4.20 when operated at 21-cm
wavelength? How does it compare to the resolution of the Hubble Telescope?
162  4 · Diffraction

     Diffraction is not only a problem for optical instruments but also for the electromagnetic radiation itself. Any

     beam of light having a finite diameter D and a wavelength exhibits diffraction spreading. The beam spreads

     out with an angle given by Equation 4.5,               . Take, for example, a laser beam made of rays as

     parallel as possible (angles between rays as close to  as possible) instead spreads out at an angle

                      , where D is the diameter of the beam and is its wavelength. This spreading is impossible to

     observe for a flashlight because its beam is not very parallel to start with. However, for long-distance

     transmission of laser beams or microwave signals, diffraction spreading can be significant (Figure 4.21). To

     avoid this, we can increase D. This is done for laser light sent to the moon to measure its distance from Earth.

     The laser beam is expanded through a telescope to make D much larger and smaller.

     Figure 4.21 The beam produced by this microwave transmission antenna spreads out at a minimum angle     due to
     diffraction. It is impossible to produce a near-parallel beam because the beam has a limited diameter.

     In most biology laboratories, resolution is an issue when the use of the microscope is introduced. The smaller
     the distance x by which two objects can be separated and still be seen as distinct, the greater the resolution.
     The resolving power of a lens is defined as that distance x. An expression for resolving power is obtained from
     the Rayleigh criterion. Figure 4.22(a) shows two point objects separated by a distance x. According to the
     Rayleigh criterion, resolution is possible when the minimum angular separation is

     where d is the distance between the specimen and the objective lens, and we have used the small angle

     approximation (i.e., we have assumed that x is much smaller than d), so that                            Therefore, the

     resolving power is

     Another way to look at this is by the concept of numerical aperture (NA), which is a measure of the maximum

     acceptance angle at which a lens will take light and still contain it within the lens. Figure 4.22(b) shows a lens

     and an object at point P. The NA here is a measure of the ability of the lens to gather light and resolve fine

     detail. The angle subtended by the lens at its focus is defined to be    . From the figure and again using the

     small angle approximation, we can write

     The NA for a lens is  , where n is the index of refraction of the medium between the objective lens

     and the object at point P. From this definition for NA, we can see that

     In a microscope, NA is important because it relates to the resolving power of a lens. A lens with a large NA is
     able to resolve finer details. Lenses with larger NA are also able to collect more light and so give a brighter

image. Another way to describe this situation is that the larger the NA, the larger the cone of light that can be
brought into the lens, so more of the diffraction modes are collected. Thus the microscope has more
information to form a clear image, and its resolving power is higher.

discussion of resolving power for a lens and an object at point P (credit a: modification of work by "Infopro"/Wikimedia Commons).

One of the consequences of diffraction is that the focal point of a beam has a finite width and intensity
distribution. Imagine focusing when only considering geometric optics, as in Figure 4.23(a). The focal point is
regarded as an infinitely small point with a huge intensity and the capacity to incinerate most samples,
irrespective of the NA of the objective lens--an unphysical oversimplification. For wave optics, due to
diffraction, we take into account the phenomenon in which the focal point spreads to become a focal spot
(Figure 4.23(b)) with the size of the spot decreasing with increasing NA. Consequently, the intensity in the focal
spot increases with increasing NA. The higher the NA, the greater the chances of photodegrading the
specimen. However, the spot never becomes a true point.

Figure 4.23 (a) In geometric optics, the focus is modelled as a point, but it is not physically possible to produce such a point because it
implies infinite intensity. (b) In wave optics, the focus is an extended region.

In a different type of microscope, molecules within a specimen are made to emit light through a mechanism
called fluorescence. By controlling the molecules emitting light, it has become possible to construct images
with resolution much finer than the Rayleigh criterion, thus circumventing the diffraction limit. The
development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy led to the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe interference and diffraction effects exhibited by X-rays in interaction with atomic-scale structures

     Since X-ray photons are very energetic, they have relatively short wavelengths, on the order of  m to

     m. Thus, typical X-ray photons act like rays when they encounter macroscopic objects, like teeth, and produce

     sharp shadows. However, since atoms are on the order of 0.1 nm in size, X-rays can be used to detect the

     location, shape, and size of atoms and molecules. The process is called X-ray diffraction, and it involves the

     interference of X-rays to produce patterns that can be analyzed for information about the structures that

     scattered the X-rays.

     Perhaps the most famous example of X-ray diffraction is the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA
     in 1953 by an international team of scientists working at England's Cavendish Laboratory--American James
     Watson, Englishman Francis Crick, and New Zealand-born Maurice Wilkins. Using X-ray diffraction data
     produced by Rosalind Franklin, they were the first to model the double-helix structure of DNA that is so crucial
     to life. For this work, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
     (There is some debate and controversy over the issue that Rosalind Franklin was not included in the prize,
     although she died in 1958, before the prize was awarded.)

     Figure 4.24 shows a diffraction pattern produced by the scattering of X-rays from a crystal. This process is
     known as X-ray crystallography because of the information it can yield about crystal structure, and it was the
     type of data Rosalind Franklin supplied to Watson and Crick for DNA. Not only do X-rays confirm the size and
     shape of atoms, they give information about the atomic arrangements in materials. For example, more recent
     research in high-temperature superconductors involves complex materials whose lattice arrangements are
     crucial to obtaining a superconducting material. These can be studied using X-ray crystallography.

     yields information about the structure of the protein. (credit: "Del45"/Wikimedia Commons)

     Historically, the scattering of X-rays from crystals was used to prove that X-rays are energetic electromagnetic
     (EM) waves. This was suspected from the time of the discovery of X-rays in 1895, but it was not until 1912 that

the German Max von Laue (1879-1960) convinced two of his colleagues to scatter X-rays from crystals. If a
diffraction pattern is obtained, he reasoned, then the X-rays must be waves, and their wavelength could be
determined. (The spacing of atoms in various crystals was reasonably well known at the time, based on good
values for Avogadro's number.) The experiments were convincing, and the 1914 Nobel Prize in Physics was
given to von Laue for his suggestion leading to the proof that X-rays are EM waves. In 1915, the unique father-
and-son team of Sir William Henry Bragg and his son Sir William Lawrence Bragg were awarded a joint Nobel
Prize for inventing the X-ray spectrometer and the then-new science of X-ray analysis.

In ways reminiscent of thin-film interference, we consider two plane waves at X-ray wavelengths, each one

reflecting off a different plane of atoms within a crystal's lattice, as shown in Figure 4.25. From the geometry,

the difference in path lengths is      . Constructive interference results when this distance is an integer

multiple of the wavelength. This condition is captured by the Bragg equation,

                                                                                                                                         4.6

where m is a positive integer and d is the spacing between the planes. Following the Law of Reflection, both the
incident and reflected waves are described by the same angle, but unlike the general practice in geometric
optics, is measured with respect to the surface itself, rather than the normal.

indicated by the dashed line.

Common table salt is composed mainly of NaCl crystals. In a NaCl crystal, there is a family of planes 0.252 nm

The determined wavelength fits within the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Once again, the wave

     For the experiment described in Example 4.7, what are the two other angles where interference maxima may
     be observed? What limits the number of maxima?

     Although Figure 4.25 depicts a crystal as a two-dimensional array of scattering centers for simplicity, real
     crystals are structures in three dimensions. Scattering can occur simultaneously from different families of
     planes at different orientations and spacing patterns known as called Bragg planes, as shown in Figure 4.26.
     The resulting interference pattern can be quite complex.

     Figure 4.26 Because of the regularity that makes a crystal structure, one crystal can have many families of planes within its geometry,
     each one giving rise to X-ray diffraction.

     4.7 Holography

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe how a three-dimensional image is recorded as a hologram
      · Describe how a three-dimensional image is formed from a hologram

     A hologram, such as the one in Figure 4.27, is a true three-dimensional image recorded on film by lasers.
     Holograms are used for amusement; decoration on novelty items and magazine covers; security on credit
     cards and driver's licenses (a laser and other equipment are needed to reproduce them); and for serious three-
     dimensional information storage. You can see that a hologram is a true three-dimensional image because
     objects change relative position in the image when viewed from different angles.

                Figure 4.27 Credit cards commonly have holograms for logos, making them difficult to reproduce. (credit: Dominic Alves)

     The name hologram means "entire picture" (from the Greek holo, as in holistic) because the image is three-
     dimensional. Holography is the process of producing holograms and, although they are recorded on
     photographic film, the process is quite different from normal photography. Holography uses light interference
     or wave optics, whereas normal photography uses geometric optics. Figure 4.28 shows one method of
     producing a hologram. Coherent light from a laser is split by a mirror, with part of the light illuminating the
     object. The remainder, called the reference beam, shines directly on a piece of film. Light scattered from the

object interferes with the reference beam, producing constructive and destructive interference. As a result, the
exposed film looks foggy, but close examination reveals a complicated interference pattern stored on it. Where
the interference was constructive, the film (a negative actually) is darkened. Holography is sometimes called
lens-less photography, because it uses the wave characteristics of light, as contrasted to normal photography,
which uses geometric optics and requires lenses.

Figure 4.28 Production of a hologram. Single-wavelength coherent light from a laser produces a well-defined interference pattern on a
piece of film. The laser beam is split by a partially silvered mirror, with part of the light illuminating the object and the remainder shining
directly on the film. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villarreal)

Light falling on a hologram can form a three-dimensional image of the original object. The process is
complicated in detail, but the basics can be understood, as shown in Figure 4.29, in which a laser of the same
type that exposed the film is now used to illuminate it. The myriad tiny exposed regions of the film are dark
and block the light, whereas less exposed regions allow light to pass. The film thus acts much like a collection
of diffraction gratings with various spacing patterns. Light passing through the hologram is diffracted in
various directions, producing both real and virtual images of the object used to expose the film. The
interference pattern is the same as that produced by the object. Moving your eye to various places in the
interference pattern gives you different perspectives, just as looking directly at the object would. The image
thus looks like the object and is three dimensional like the object.

Figure 4.29 A transmission hologram is one that produces real and virtual images when a laser of the same type as that which exposed
the hologram is passed through it. Diffraction from various parts of the film produces the same interference pattern that was produced by
the object that was used to expose it. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villarreal)

The hologram illustrated in Figure 4.29 is a transmission hologram. Holograms that are viewed with reflected
light, such as the white light holograms on credit cards, are reflection holograms and are more common. White
light holograms often appear a little blurry with rainbow edges, because the diffraction patterns of various
colors of light are at slightly different locations due to their different wavelengths. Further uses of holography
include all types of three-dimensional information storage, such as of statues in museums, engineering
studies of structures, and images of human organs.
168  4 · Diffraction

     Invented in the late 1940s by Dennis Gabor (1900-1970), who won the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physics for his
     work, holography became far more practical with the development of the laser. Since lasers produce coherent
     single-wavelength light, their interference patterns are more pronounced. The precision is so great that it is
     even possible to record numerous holograms on a single piece of film by just changing the angle of the film for
     each successive image. This is how the holograms that move as you walk by them are produced--a kind of lens-
     less movie.

     In a similar way, in the medical field, holograms have allowed complete three-dimensional holographic
     displays of objects from a stack of images. Storing these images for future use is relatively easy. With the use of
     an endoscope, high-resolution, three-dimensional holographic images of internal organs and tissues can be
     made.

INTRODUCTION The special theory of relativity was proposed in 1905 by Albert Einstein (1879-1955). It
describes how time, space, and physical phenomena appear in different frames of reference that are moving at
constant velocity with respect to each other. This differs from Einstein's later work on general relativity, which
180  5 · Relativity

     deals with any frame of reference, including accelerated frames.

     The theory of relativity led to a profound change in the way we perceive space and time. The "common sense"

     rules that we use to relate space and time measurements in the Newtonian worldview differ seriously from the

     correct rules at speeds near the speed of light. For example, the special theory of relativity tells us that

     measurements of length and time intervals are not the same in reference frames moving relative to one

     another. A particle might be observed to have a lifetime of             in one reference frame, but a lifetime

     of              in another; and an object might be measured to be 2.0 m long in one frame and 3.0 m long in

     another frame. These effects are usually significant only at speeds comparable to the speed of light, but even at

     the much lower speeds of the global positioning satellite, which requires extremely accurate time

     measurements to function, the different lengths of the same distance in different frames of reference are

     significant enough that they need to be taken into account.

     Unlike Newtonian mechanics, which describes the motion of particles, or Maxwell's equations, which specify
     how the electromagnetic field behaves, special relativity is not restricted to a particular type of phenomenon.
     Instead, its rules on space and time affect all fundamental physical theories.

     The modifications of Newtonian mechanics in special relativity do not invalidate classical Newtonian
     mechanics or require its replacement. Instead, the equations of relativistic mechanics differ meaningfully
     from those of classical Newtonian mechanics only for objects moving at relativistic speeds (i.e., speeds less
     than, but comparable to, the speed of light). In the macroscopic world that you encounter in your daily life, the
     relativistic equations reduce to classical equations, and the predictions of classical Newtonian mechanics
     agree closely enough with experimental results to disregard relativistic corrections.

     5.1 Invariance of Physical Laws

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe the theoretical and experimental issues that Einstein's theory of special relativity addressed.
      · State the two postulates of the special theory of relativity.

     Suppose you calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the base angles and adjacent sides. Whether you
     calculate the hypotenuse from one of the sides and the cosine of the base angle, or from the Pythagorean
     theorem, the results should agree. Predictions based on different principles of physics must also agree,
     whether we consider them principles of mechanics or principles of electromagnetism.

     Albert Einstein pondered a disagreement between predictions based on electromagnetism and on
     assumptions made in classical mechanics. Specifically, suppose an observer measures the velocity of a light
     pulse in the observer's own rest frame; that is, in the frame of reference in which the observer is at rest.
     According to the assumptions long considered obvious in classical mechanics, if an observer measures a
     velocity in one frame of reference, and that frame of reference is moving with velocity past a second

     reference frame, an observer in the second frame measures the original velocity as  This sum of

     velocities is often referred to as Galilean relativity. If this principle is correct, the pulse of light that the

     observer measures as traveling with speed c travels at speed c + u measured in the frame of the second

     observer. If we reasonably assume that the laws of electrodynamics are the same in both frames of reference,

     then the predicted speed of light (in vacuum) in both frames should be              Each observer should

     measure the same speed of the light pulse with respect to that observer's own rest frame. To reconcile
     difficulties of this kind, Einstein constructed his special theory of relativity, which introduced radical new
     ideas about time and space that have since been confirmed experimentally.

     Inertial Frames

     All velocities are measured relative to some frame of reference. For example, a car's motion is measured
     relative to its starting position on the road it travels on; a projectile's motion is measured relative to the surface
     from which it is launched; and a planet's orbital motion is measured relative to the star it orbits. The frames of
     reference in which mechanics takes the simplest form are those that are not accelerating. Newton's first law,
     the law of inertia, holds exactly in such a frame.

Inertial Reference Frame

An inertial frame of reference is a reference frame in which a body at rest remains at rest and a body in
motion moves at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted upon by an outside force.

For example, to a passenger inside a plane flying at constant speed and constant altitude, physics seems to
work exactly the same as when the passenger is standing on the surface of Earth. When the plane is taking off,
however, matters are somewhat more complicated. In this case, the passenger at rest inside the plane
concludes that a net force F on an object is not equal to the product of mass and acceleration, ma. Instead, F is
equal to ma plus a fictitious force. This situation is not as simple as in an inertial frame. Special relativity
handles accelerating frames as a constant and velocities as relative to the observer. General relativity treats
both velocity and acceleration as relative to the observer, thus making the use of curved space-time.

Einstein's First Postulate

Not only are the principles of classical mechanics simplest in inertial frames, but they are the same in all
inertial frames. Einstein based the first postulate of his theory on the idea that this is true for all the laws of
physics, not merely those in mechanics.

  First Postulate of Special Relativity

  The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.

This postulate denies the existence of a special or preferred inertial frame. The laws of nature do not give us a
way to endow any one inertial frame with special properties. For example, we cannot identify any inertial
frame as being in a state of "absolute rest." We can only determine the relative motion of one frame with
respect to another.

There is, however, more to this postulate than meets the eye. The laws of physics include only those that satisfy

this postulate. We will see that the definitions of energy and momentum must be altered to fit this postulate.

Another outcome of this postulate is the famous equation       which relates energy to mass.

Einstein's Second Postulate

The second postulate upon which Einstein based his theory of special relativity deals with the speed of light.

Late in the nineteenth century, the major tenets of classical physics were well established. Two of the most

important were the laws of electromagnetism and Newton's laws. Investigations such as Young's double-slit

experiment in the early 1800s had convincingly demonstrated that light is a wave. Maxwell's equations of

electromagnetism implied that electromagnetic waves travel at  in a vacuum, but they do

not specify the frame of reference in which light has this speed. Many types of waves were known, and all

travelled in some medium. Scientists therefore assumed that some medium carried the light, even in a

vacuum, and that light travels at a speed c relative to that medium (often called "the aether").

Starting in the mid-1880s, the American physicist A.A. Michelson, later aided by E.W. Morley, made a series of
direct measurements of the speed of light. They intended to deduce from their data the speed v at which Earth
was moving through the mysterious medium for light waves. The speed of light measured on Earth should
have been c + v when Earth's motion was opposite to the medium's flow at speed u past the Earth, and c - v
when Earth was moving in the same direction as the medium. The results of their measurements were
startling.

Michelson-Morley Experiment

The Michelson-Morley experiment demonstrated that the speed of light in a vacuum is independent of the
182  5 · Relativity

     motion of Earth about the Sun.

     The eventual conclusion derived from this result is that light, unlike mechanical waves such as sound, does not
     need a medium to carry it. Furthermore, the Michelson-Morley results implied that the speed of light c is
     independent of the motion of the source relative to the observer. That is, everyone observes light to move at
     speed c regardless of how they move relative to the light source or to one another. For several years, many
     scientists tried unsuccessfully to explain these results within the framework of Newton's laws.

     In addition, there was a contradiction between the principles of electromagnetism and the assumption made
     in Newton's laws about relative velocity. Classically, the velocity of an object in one frame of reference and the
     velocity of that object in a second frame of reference relative to the first should combine like simple vectors to
     give the velocity seen in the second frame. If that were correct, then two observers moving at different speeds
     would see light traveling at different speeds. Imagine what a light wave would look like to a person traveling
     along with it (in vacuum) at a speed c. If such a motion were possible, then the wave would be stationary
     relative to the observer. It would have electric and magnetic fields whose strengths varied with position but
     were constant in time. This is not allowed by Maxwell's equations. So either Maxwell's equations are different
     in different inertial frames, or an object with mass cannot travel at speed c. Einstein concluded that the latter
     is true: An object with mass cannot travel at speed c. Maxwell's equations are correct, but Newton's addition of
     velocities is not correct for light.

     Not until 1905, when Einstein published his first paper on special relativity, was the currently accepted
     conclusion reached. Based mostly on his analysis that the laws of electricity and magnetism would not allow
     another speed for light, and only slightly aware of the Michelson-Morley experiment, Einstein detailed his
     second postulate of special relativity.

       Second Postulate of Special Relativity

       Light travels in a vacuum with the same speed c in any direction in all inertial frames.

     In other words, the speed of light has the same definite speed for any observer, regardless of the relative
     motion of the source. This deceptively simple and counterintuitive postulate, along with the first postulate,
     leave all else open for change. Among the changes are the loss of agreement on the time between events, the
     variation of distance with speed, and the realization that matter and energy can be converted into one another.
     We describe these concepts in the following sections.

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Show from Einstein's postulates that two events measured as simultaneous in one inertial frame are not
           necessarily simultaneous in all inertial frames.

      · Describe how simultaneity is a relative concept for observers in different inertial frames in relative motion.

     Do time intervals depend on who observes them? Intuitively, it seems that the time for a process, such as the
     elapsed time for a foot race (Figure 5.2), should be the same for all observers. In everyday experiences,
     disagreements over elapsed time have to do with the accuracy of measuring time. No one would be likely to
     argue that the actual time interval was different for the moving runner and for the stationary clock displayed.
     Carefully considering just how time is measured, however, shows that elapsed time does depends on the
     relative motion of an observer with respect to the process being measured.

Figure 5.2 Elapsed time for a foot race is the same for all observers, but at relativistic speeds, elapsed time depends on the motion of the
observer relative to the location where the process being timed occurs. (credit: "Jason Edward Scott Bain"/Flickr)

Consider how we measure elapsed time. If we use a stopwatch, for example, how do we know when to start and
stop the watch? One method is to use the arrival of light from the event. For example, if you're in a moving car
and observe the light arriving from a traffic signal change from green to red, you know it's time to step on the
brake pedal. The timing is more accurate if some sort of electronic detection is used, avoiding human reaction
times and other complications.

Now suppose two observers use this method to measure the time interval between two flashes of light from
flash lamps that are a distance apart (Figure 5.3). An observer A is seated midway on a rail car with two flash
lamps at opposite sides equidistant from her. A pulse of light is emitted from each flash lamp and moves
toward observer A, shown in frame (a) of the figure. The rail car is moving rapidly in the direction indicated by
the velocity vector in the diagram. An observer B standing on the platform is facing the rail car as it passes and
observes both flashes of light reach him simultaneously, as shown in frame (c). He measures the distances
from where he saw the pulses originate, finds them equal, and concludes that the pulses were emitted
simultaneously.

However, because of Observer A's motion, the pulse from the right of the railcar, from the direction the car is
moving, reaches her before the pulse from the left, as shown in frame (b). She also measures the distances
from within her frame of reference, finds them equal, and concludes that the pulses were not emitted
simultaneously.

The two observers reach conflicting conclusions about whether the two events at well-separated locations
were simultaneous. Both frames of reference are valid, and both conclusions are valid. Whether two events at
separate locations are simultaneous depends on the motion of the observer relative to the locations of the
events.
184  5 · Relativity

     Figure 5.3 (a) Two pulses of light are emitted simultaneously relative to observer B. (c) The pulses reach observer B's position
     simultaneously. (b) Because of A's motion, she sees the pulse from the right first and concludes the bulbs did not flash simultaneously.
     Both conclusions are correct.

     Here, the relative velocity between observers affects whether two events a distance apart are observed to be
     simultaneous. Simultaneity is not absolute. We might have guessed (incorrectly) that if light is emitted
     simultaneously, then two observers halfway between the sources would see the flashes simultaneously. But
     careful analysis shows this cannot be the case if the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames.
     This type of thought experiment (in German, "Gedankenexperiment") shows that seemingly obvious
     conclusions must be changed to agree with the postulates of relativity. The validity of thought experiments can
     only be determined by actual observation, and careful experiments have repeatedly confirmed Einstein's
     theory of relativity.

5.3 Time Dilation

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Explain how time intervals can be measured differently in different reference frames.
 · Describe how to distinguish a proper time interval from a dilated time interval.
 · Describe the significance of the muon experiment.
 · Explain why the twin paradox is not a contradiction.
 · Calculate time dilation given the speed of an object in a given frame.

The analysis of simultaneity shows that Einstein's postulates imply an important effect: Time intervals have
different values when measured in different inertial frames. Suppose, for example, an astronaut measures the
time it takes for a pulse of light to travel a distance perpendicular to the direction of his ship's motion (relative
to an earthbound observer), bounce off a mirror, and return (Figure 5.4). How does the elapsed time that the
astronaut measures in the spacecraft compare with the elapsed time that an earthbound observer measures
by observing what is happening in the spacecraft?

Examining this question leads to a profound result. The elapsed time for a process depends on which observer
is measuring it. In this case, the time measured by the astronaut (within the spaceship where the astronaut is
at rest) is smaller than the time measured by the earthbound observer (to whom the astronaut is moving). The
time elapsed for the same process is different for the observers, because the distance the light pulse travels in
the astronaut's frame is smaller than in the earthbound frame, as seen in Figure 5.4. Light travels at the same
speed in each frame, so it takes more time to travel the greater distance in the earthbound frame.
186  5 · Relativity

     Figure 5.4 (a) An astronaut measures the time for light to travel distance 2D in the astronaut's frame. (b) A NASA scientist on Earth
     sees the light follow the longer path 2s and take a longer time (c) These triangles are used to find the relationship between the two
     distances D and s.

       Time Dilation

       Time dilation is the lengthening of the time interval between two events for an observer in an inertial
       frame that is moving with respect to the rest frame of the events (in which the events occur at the same
       location).

     To quantitatively compare the time measurements in the two inertial frames, we can relate the distances in
     Figure 5.4 to each other, then express each distance in terms of the time of travel (respectively either or )
     of the pulse in the corresponding reference frame. The resulting equation can then be solved for in terms of

     The lengths D and L in Figure 5.4 are the sides of a right triangle with hypotenuse s. From the Pythagorean
     theorem,

     The lengths 2s and 2L are, respectively, the distances that the pulse of light and the spacecraft travel in time
     in the earthbound observer's frame. The length D is the distance that the light pulse travels in time in the

astronaut's frame. This gives us three equations:

Note that we used Einstein's second postulate by taking the speed of light to be c in both inertial frames. We
substitute these results into the previous expression from the Pythagorean theorem:

Then we rearrange to obtain

Finally, solving for in terms of gives us

                                                                                                                                                       5.1

This is equivalent to

where is the relativistic factor (often called the Lorentz factor) given by

                                                                                                                                                       5.2

and v and c are the speeds of the moving observer and light, respectively.
Note the asymmetry between the two measurements. Only one of them is a measurement of the time interval
between two events--the emission and arrival of the light pulse--at the same position. It is a measurement of
the time interval in the rest frame of a single clock. The measurement in the earthbound frame involves
comparing the time interval between two events that occur at different locations. The time interval between
events that occur at a single location has a separate name to distinguish it from the time measured by the
earthbound observer, and we use the separate symbol to refer to it throughout this chapter.

  Proper Time

  The proper time interval between two events is the time interval measured by an observer for whom
  both events occur at the same location.

The equation relating and is truly remarkable. First, as stated earlier, elapsed time is not the same for
different observers moving relative to one another, even though both are in inertial frames. A proper time
interval for an observer who, like the astronaut, is moving with the apparatus, is smaller than the time
interval for other observers. It is the smallest possible measured time between two events. The earthbound
observer sees time intervals within the moving system as dilated (i.e., lengthened) relative to how the observer
moving relative to Earth sees them within the moving system. Alternatively, according to the earthbound
observer, less time passes between events within the moving frame. Note that the shortest elapsed time
between events is in the inertial frame in which the observer sees the events (e.g., the emission and arrival of
the light signal) occur at the same point.
This time effect is real and is not caused by inaccurate clocks or improper measurements. Time-interval
measurements of the same event differ for observers in relative motion. The dilation of time is an intrinsic
property of time itself. All clocks moving relative to an observer, including biological clocks, such as a person's
heartbeat, or aging, are observed to run more slowly compared with a clock that is stationary relative to the
188  5 · Relativity

     observer.

     Note that if the relative velocity is much less than the speed of light  then  is extremely small, and

     the elapsed times and are nearly equal. At low velocities, physics based on modern relativity approaches

     speed of light,  is close to one, so  is very small and becomes significantly larger than

     Half-Life of a Muon

     There is considerable experimental evidence that the equation            is correct. One example is found in

     cosmic ray particles that continuously rain down on Earth from deep space. Some collisions of these particles

     with nuclei in the upper atmosphere result in short-lived particles called muons. The half-life (amount of time
     for half of a material to decay) of a muon is 1.52 s when it is at rest relative to the observer who measures the

     half-life. This is the proper time interval This short time allows very few muons to reach Earth's surface

     and be detected if Newtonian assumptions about time and space were correct. However, muons produced by

     cosmic ray particles have a range of velocities, with some moving near the speed of light. It has been found that

     the muon's half-life as measured by an earthbound observer ( ) varies with velocity exactly as predicted by

     the equation     The faster the muon moves, the longer it lives. We on Earth see the muon last much

     longer than its half-life predicts within its own rest frame. As viewed from our frame, the muon decays more

     slowly than it does when at rest relative to us. A far larger fraction of muons reach the ground as a result.

     Before we present the first example of solving a problem in relativity, we state a strategy you can use as a
     guideline for these calculations.

             PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

     Relativity

     1. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). Look in
          particular for information on relative velocity v.

     2. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns).
     3. Make certain you understand the conceptual aspects of the problem before making any calculations

           (express the answer as an equation). Decide, for example, which observer sees time dilated or length
           contracted before working with the equations or using them to carry out the calculation. If you have
           thought about who sees what, who is moving with the event being observed, who sees proper time, and so
           on, you will find it much easier to determine if your calculation is reasonable.
     4. Determine the primary type of calculation to be done to find the unknowns identified above (do the
           calculation). You will find the section summary helpful in determining whether a length contraction,
           relativistic kinetic energy, or some other concept is involved.

     Note that you should not round off during the calculation. As noted in the text, you must often perform your
     calculations to many digits to see the desired effect. You may round off at the very end of the problem solution,
     but do not use a rounded number in a subsequent calculation. Also, check the answer to see if it is reasonable:
     Does it make sense? This may be more difficult for relativity, which has few everyday examples to provide
     experience with what is reasonable. But you can look for velocities greater than c or relativistic effects that are
     in the wrong direction (such as a time contraction where a dilation was expected).

     Calculating for a Relativistic Event

     Suppose a cosmic ray colliding with a nucleus in Earth's upper atmosphere produces a muon that has a

     velocity        The muon then travels at constant velocity and lives 2.20 s as measured in the muon's

     frame of reference. (You can imagine this as the muon's internal clock.) How long does the muon live as

     measured by an earthbound observer (Figure 5.5)?

     Figure 5.5 A muon in Earth's atmosphere lives longer as measured by an earthbound observer than as measured by the muon's internal
     clock.

     As we will discuss later, in the muon's reference frame, it travels a shorter distance than measured in Earth's
     reference frame.

     Strategy

     A clock moving with the muon measures the proper time of its decay process, so the time we are given is

Significance

One implication of this example is that because          at 95.0% of the speed of light              the

relativistic effects are significant. The two time intervals differ by a factor of 3.20, when classically they would

be the same. Something moving at 0.950c is said to be highly relativistic.

Relativistic Television

A non-flat screen, older-style television display (Figure 5.6) works by accelerating electrons over a short

distance to relativistic speed, and then using electromagnetic fields to control where the electron beam strikes

a fluorescent layer at the front of the tube. Suppose the electrons travel at                        through a distance

of  from the start of the beam to the screen. (a) What is the time of travel of an electron in the rest frame

of the television set? (b) What is the electron's time of travel in its own rest frame?

      c. Express the answer as an equation:

     d. Do the calculation:

     Significance
     The time of travel is extremely short, as expected. Because the calculation is entirely within a single frame of
     reference, relativity is not involved, even though the electron speed is close to c.

     Strategy for (b)
     (b) In the frame of reference of the electron, the vacuum tube is moving and the electron is stationary. The
     electron-emitting cathode leaves the electron and the front of the vacuum tube strikes the electron with the
     electron at the same location. Therefore we use the time dilation formula to relate the proper time in the
     electron rest frame to the time in the television frame.

     Solution

     a. Identify the knowns (from part a):

     b. Identify the unknown:
      c. Express the answer as an equation:

     d. Do the calculation:

     Significance

     The time of travel is shorter in the electron frame of reference. Because the problem requires finding the time
     interval measured in different reference frames for the same process, relativity is involved. If we had tried to
     calculate the time in the electron rest frame by simply dividing the 0.200 m by the speed, the result would be
     slightly incorrect because of the relativistic speed of the electron.

     What is if

     The Twin Paradox

     An intriguing consequence of time dilation is that a space traveler moving at a high velocity relative to Earth

     would age less than the astronaut's earthbound twin. This is often known as the twin paradox. Imagine the

     astronaut moving at such a velocity that     as in Figure 5.7. A trip that takes 2.00 years in her frame

     would take 60.0 years in the earthbound twin's frame. Suppose the astronaut travels 1.00 year to another star

system, briefly explores the area, and then travels 1.00 year back. An astronaut who was 40 years old at the
start of the trip would be would be 42 when the spaceship returns. Everything on Earth, however, would have
aged 60.0 years. The earthbound twin, if still alive, would be 100 years old.

The situation would seem different to the astronaut in Figure 5.7. Because motion is relative, the spaceship
would seem to be stationary and Earth would appear to move. (This is the sensation you have when flying in a
jet.) Looking out the window of the spaceship, the astronaut would see time slow down on Earth by a factor of

             Seen from the spaceship, the earthbound sibling will have aged only 2/30, or 0.07, of a year, whereas
the astronaut would have aged 2.00 years.

Figure 5.7 The twin paradox consists of the conflicting conclusions about which twin ages more as a result of a long space journey at
relativistic speed.

The paradox here is that the two twins cannot both be correct. As with all paradoxes, conflicting conclusions
come from a false premise. In fact, the astronaut's motion is significantly different from that of the earthbound
twin. The astronaut accelerates to a high velocity and then accelerates opposite to the motion to view the star
system. To return to Earth, she again accelerates and decelerates. The spacecraft is not in a single inertial
frame to which the time dilation formula can be directly applied. That is, the astronaut twin changes inertial
references. The earthbound twin does not experience these accelerations and remains in the same inertial
frame. Thus, the situation is not symmetric, and it is incorrect to claim that the astronaut observes the same
effects as her twin. The lack of symmetry between the twins will be still more evident when we analyze the
journey later in this chapter in terms of the path the astronaut follows through four-dimensional space-time.

In 1971, American physicists Joseph Hafele and Richard Keating verified time dilation at low relative velocities
by flying extremely accurate atomic clocks around the world on commercial aircraft. They measured elapsed
time to an accuracy of a few nanoseconds and compared it with the time measured by clocks left behind.
Hafele and Keating's results were within experimental uncertainties of the predictions of relativity. Both
special and general relativity had to be taken into account, because gravity and accelerations were involved as
well as relative motion.

     5.4 Length Contraction

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Explain how simultaneity and length contraction are related.
      · Describe the relation between length contraction and time dilation and use it to derive the length-contraction

           equation.

     The length of the train car in Figure 5.8 is the same for all the passengers. All of them would agree on the
     simultaneous location of the two ends of the car and obtain the same result for the distance between them. But
     simultaneous events in one inertial frame need not be simultaneous in another. If the train could travel at
     relativistic speeds, an observer on the ground would see the simultaneous locations of the two endpoints of the
     car at a different distance apart than observers inside the car. Measured distances need not be the same for
     different observers when relativistic speeds are involved.

     Figure 5.8 People might describe distances differently, but at relativistic speeds, the distances really are different. (credit:
     "russavia"/Flickr)

     Proper Length

     Two observers passing each other always see the same value of their relative speed. Even though time dilation
     implies that the train passenger and the observer standing alongside the tracks measure different times for
     the train to pass, they still agree that relative speed, which is distance divided by elapsed time, is the same. If
     an observer on the ground and one on the train measure a different time for the length of the train to pass the
     ground observer, agreeing on their relative speed means they must also see different distances traveled.
     The muon discussed in Example 5.3 illustrates this concept (Figure 5.9). To an observer on Earth, the muon
     travels at 0.950c for 7.05 s from the time it is produced until it decays. Therefore, it travels a distance relative
     to Earth of:

     In the muon frame, the lifetime of the muon is 2.20 s. In this frame of reference, the Earth, air, and ground
     have only enough time to travel:

     The distance between the same two events (production and decay of a muon) depends on who measures it and
     how they are moving relative to it.

  Proper Length

  Proper length is the distance between two points measured by an observer who is at rest relative to
  both of the points.

The earthbound observer measures the proper length because the points at which the muon is produced
and decays are stationary relative to Earth. To the muon, Earth, air, and clouds are moving, so the distance L it
sees is not the proper length.

Figure 5.9 (a) The earthbound observer sees the muon travel 2.01 km. (b) The same path has length 0.627 km seen from the muon's
frame of reference. The Earth, air, and clouds are moving relative to the muon in its frame, and have smaller lengths along the direction of
travel.

Length Contraction

To relate distances measured by different observers, note that the velocity relative to the earthbound observer
in our muon example is given by

The time relative to the earthbound observer is because the object being timed is moving relative to this
observer. The velocity relative to the moving observer is given by

The moving observer travels with the muon and therefore observes the proper time  The two velocities are
identical; thus,

We know that  Substituting this equation into the relationship above gives

                                                                                                    5.3

Substituting for gives an equation relating the distances measured by different observers.

Length Contraction

Length contraction is the decrease in the measured length of an object from its proper length when
measured in a reference frame that is moving with respect to the object:

                                                                                                    5.4
196  5 · Relativity

     where is the length of the object in its rest frame, and L is the length in the frame moving with velocity v.

     If we measure the length of anything moving relative to our frame, we find its length L to be smaller than the
     proper length that would be measured if the object were stationary. For example, in the muon's rest frame,
     the distance Earth moves between where the muon was produced and where it decayed is shorter than the
     distance traveled as seen from the Earth's frame. Those points are fixed relative to Earth but are moving
     relative to the muon. Clouds and other objects are also contracted along the direction of motion as seen from
     muon's rest frame.

     Thus, two observers measure different distances along their direction of relative motion, depending on which
     one is measuring distances between objects at rest.

     But what about distances measured in a direction perpendicular to the relative motion? Imagine two observers
     moving along their x-axes and passing each other while holding meter sticks vertically in the y-direction.
     Figure 5.10 shows two meter sticks M and that are at rest in the reference frames of two boys S and
     respectively. A small paintbrush is attached to the top (the 100-cm mark) of stick Suppose that is
     moving to the right at a very high speed v relative to S, and the sticks are oriented so that they are
     perpendicular, or transverse, to their relative velocity vector. The sticks are held so that as they pass each
     other, their lower ends (the 0-cm marks) coincide. Assume that when S looks at his stick M afterwards, he finds
     a line painted on it, just below the top of the stick. Because the brush is attached to the top of the other boy's
     stick S can only conclude that stick is less than 1.0 m long.

     Figure 5.10 Meter sticks M and are stationary in the reference frames of observers S and  respectively. As the sticks pass, a small
     brush attached to the 100-cm mark of paints a line on M.

     Now when the boys approach each other, like S, sees a meter stick moving toward him with speed v.
     Because their situations are symmetric, each boy must make the same measurement of the stick in the other
     frame. So, if S measures stick to be less than 1.0 m long, must measure stick M to be also less than 1.0 m
     long, and must see his paintbrush pass over the top of stick M and not paint a line on it. In other words, after
     the same event, one boy sees a painted line on a stick, while the other does not see such a line on that same
     stick!

     Einstein's first postulate requires that the laws of physics (as, for example, applied to painting) predict that S
     and who are both in inertial frames, make the same observations; that is, S and must either both see a
     line painted on stick M, or both not see that line. We are therefore forced to conclude our original assumption
     that S saw a line painted below the top of his stick was wrong! Instead, S finds the line painted right at the
     100-cm mark on M. Then both boys will agree that a line is painted on M, and they will also agree that both
     sticks are exactly 1 m long. We conclude then that measurements of a transverse length must be the same in
     different inertial frames.

EXAMPLE 5.5

Calculating Length Contraction

Suppose an astronaut, such as the twin in the twin paradox discussion, travels so fast that              (a) The

astronaut travels from Earth to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, 4.300 light years (ly) away as

measured by an earthbound observer. How far apart are Earth and Alpha Centauri as measured by the

astronaut? (b) In terms of c, what is the astronaut's velocity relative to Earth? You may neglect the motion of

Earth relative to the sun (Figure 5.11).

Figure 5.11 (a) The earthbound observer measures the proper distance between Earth and Alpha Centauri. (b) The astronaut observes a
length contraction because Earth and Alpha Centauri move relative to her ship. She can travel this shorter distance in a smaller time (her
proper time) without exceeding the speed of light.

Strategy
First, note that a light year (ly) is a convenient unit of distance on an astronomical scale--it is the distance light
travels in a year. For part (a), the 4.300-ly distance between Alpha Centauri and Earth is the proper distance

     because it is measured by an earthbound observer to whom both stars are (approximately) stationary. To
the astronaut, Earth and Alpha Centauri are moving past at the same velocity, so the distance between them is
the contracted length L. In part (b), we are given so we can find v by rearranging the definition of to express
v in terms of c.

     Significance

     Remember not to round off calculations until the final answer, or you could get erroneous results. This is

     especially true for special relativity calculations, where the differences might only be revealed after several

     decimal places. The relativistic effect is large here  and we see that v is approaching (not equaling)

     the speed of light. Because the distance as measured by the astronaut is so much smaller, the astronaut can

     travel it in much less time in her frame.

     People traveling at extremely high velocities could cover very large distances (thousands or even millions of
     light years) and age only a few years on the way. However, like emigrants in past centuries who left their home,
     these people would leave the Earth they know forever. Even if they returned, thousands to millions of years
     would have passed on Earth, obliterating most of what now exists. There is also a more serious practical
     obstacle to traveling at such velocities; immensely greater energies would be needed to achieve such high
     velocities than classical physics predicts can be attained. This will be discussed later in the chapter.

     Why don't we notice length contraction in everyday life? The distance to the grocery store does not seem to

     depend on whether we are moving or not. Examining the equation  we see that at low

     velocities      the lengths are nearly equal, which is the classical expectation. But length contraction is

     real, if not commonly experienced. For example, a charged particle such as an electron traveling at relativistic

     velocity has electric field lines that are compressed along the direction of motion as seen by a stationary

     observer (Figure 5.12). As the electron passes a detector, such as a coil of wire, its field interacts much more

briefly, an effect observed at particle accelerators such as the 3-km-long Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC). In
fact, to an electron traveling down the beam pipe at SLAC, the accelerator and Earth are all moving by and are
length contracted. The relativistic effect is so great that the accelerator is only 0.5 m long to the electron. It is
actually easier to get the electron beam down the pipe, because the beam does not have to be as precisely
aimed to get down a short pipe as it would to get down a pipe 3 km long. This, again, is an experimental
verification of the special theory of relativity.

5.5 The Lorentz Transformation

Learning Objectives

 · Describe the Galilean transformation of classical mechanics, relating the position, time, velocities, and

 · Explain the Lorentz transformation and many of the features of relativity in terms of four-dimensional space-

We have used the postulates of relativity to examine, in particular examples, how observers in different frames
of reference measure different values for lengths and the time intervals. We can gain further insight into how
the postulates of relativity change the Newtonian view of time and space by examining the transformation
equations that give the space and time coordinates of events in one inertial reference frame in terms of those
in another. We first examine how position and time coordinates transform between inertial frames according
to the view in Newtonian physics. Then we examine how this has to be changed to agree with the postulates of
relativity. Finally, we examine the resulting Lorentz transformation equations and some of their consequences
in terms of four-dimensional space-time diagrams, to support the view that the consequences of special
relativity result from the properties of time and space itself, rather than electromagnetism.

The Galilean Transformation Equations

An event is specified by its location and time (x, y, z, t) relative to one particular inertial frame of reference S.
As an example, (x, y, z, t) could denote the position of a particle at time t, and we could be looking at these
positions for many different times to follow the motion of the particle. Suppose a second frame of reference
moves with velocity v with respect to the first. For simplicity, assume this relative velocity is along the x-axis.
The relation between the time and coordinates in the two frames of reference is then
200  5 · Relativity

     Implicit in these equations is the assumption that time measurements made by observers in both S and are
     the same. That is,

     These four equations are known collectively as the Galilean transformation.

     We can obtain the Galilean velocity and acceleration transformation equations by differentiating these
     equations with respect to time. We use u for the velocity of a particle throughout this chapter to distinguish it
     from v, the relative velocity of two reference frames. Note that, for the Galilean transformation, the increment
     of time used in differentiating to calculate the particle velocity is the same in both frames,
     Differentiation yields

     and

     We denote the velocity of the particle by u rather than v to avoid confusion with the velocity v of one frame of

     reference with respect to the other. Velocities in each frame differ by the velocity that one frame has as seen

     from the other frame. Observers in both frames of reference measure the same value of the acceleration.

     Because the mass is unchanged by the transformation, and distances between points are uncharged,

     observers in both frames see the same forces  acting between objects and the same form of Newton's

     second and third laws in all inertial frames. The laws of mechanics are consistent with the first postulate of

     relativity.

     The Lorentz Transformation Equations

     The Galilean transformation nevertheless violates Einstein's postulates, because the velocity equations state

     that a pulse of light moving with speed c along the x-axis would travel at speed  in the other inertial frame.

     Specifically, the spherical pulse has radius  at time t in the unprimed frame, and also has radius

     at time in the primed frame. Expressing these relations in Cartesian coordinates gives

     The left-hand sides of the two expressions can be set equal because both are zero. Because  and

     we obtain

                                                                                                              5.5

     This cannot be satisfied for nonzero relative velocity v of the two frames if we assume the Galilean

     transformation results in         with

     To find the correct set of transformation equations, assume the two coordinate systems S and in Figure

The equations relating the time and position of the events as seen in S are then

This set of equations, relating the position and time in the two inertial frames, is known as the Lorentz
transformation. They are named in honor of H.A. Lorentz (1853-1928), who first proposed them.
Interestingly, he justified the transformation on what was eventually discovered to be a fallacious hypothesis.
The correct theoretical basis is Einstein's special theory of relativity.

The reverse transformation expresses the variables in S in terms of those in      Simply interchanging the

     Space-time

     Relativistic phenomena can be analyzed in terms of events in a four-dimensional space-time. When
     phenomena such as the twin paradox, time dilation, length contraction, and the dependence of simultaneity
     on relative motion are viewed in this way, they are seen to be characteristic of the nature of space and time,
     rather than specific aspects of electromagnetism.

     In three-dimensional space, positions are specified by three coordinates on a set of Cartesian axes, and the
     displacement of one point from another is given by:

     The distance between the points is

     The distance is invariant under a rotation of axes. If a new set of Cartesian axes rotated around the origin
     relative to the original axes are used, each point in space will have new coordinates in terms of the new axes,
     but the distance given by

     That has the same value that      had. Something similar happens with the Lorentz transformation in space-
     time.

     Define the separation between two events, each given by a set of x, y, z¸ and ct along a four-dimensional
     Cartesian system of axes in space-time, as

     Also define the space-time interval between the two events as

     If the two events have the same value of ct in the frame of reference considered,  would correspond to the
     distance between points in space.

     The path of a particle through space-time consists of the events (x, y, z¸ ct) specifying a location at each time of

     its motion. The path through space-time is called the world line of the particle. The world line of a particle that

     remains at rest at the same location is a straight line that is parallel to the time axis. If the particle moves at

     constant velocity parallel to the x-axis, its world line would be a sloped line    corresponding to a simple

     displacement vs. time graph. If the particle accelerates, its world line is curved. The increment of s along the

     world line of the particle is given in differential form as

     Just as the distance is invariant under rotation of the space axes, the space-time interval:

     is invariant under the Lorentz transformation. This follows from the postulates of relativity, and can be seen
     also by substitution of the previous Lorentz transformation equations into the expression for the space-time
     interval:

In addition, the Lorentz transformation changes the coordinates of an event in time and space similarly to how
a three-dimensional rotation changes old coordinates into new coordinates:

where

Lorentz transformations can be regarded as generalizations of spatial rotations to space-time. However, there
are some differences between a three-dimensional axis rotation and a Lorentz transformation involving the
time axis, because of differences in how the metric, or rule for measuring the displacements and differ.
Although is invariant under spatial rotations and is invariant also under Lorentz transformation, the
Lorentz transformation involving the time axis does not preserve some features, such as the axes remaining
perpendicular or the length scale along each axis remaining the same.

Note that the quantity can have either sign, depending on the coordinates of the space-time events

involved. For pairs of events that give it a negative sign, it is useful to define  as  The significance

The light cone

We can deal with the difficulty of visualizing and sketching graphs in four dimensions by imagining the three
spatial coordinates to be represented collectively by a horizontal axis, and the vertical axis to be the ct-axis.
Starting with a particular event in space-time as the origin of the space-time graph shown, the world line of a
particle that remains at rest at the initial location of the event at the origin then is the time axis. Any plane
through the time axis parallel to the spatial axes contains all the events that are simultaneous with each other
and with the intersection of the plane and the time axis, as seen in the rest frame of the event at the origin.

It is useful to picture a light cone on the graph, formed by the world lines of all light beams passing through the
origin event A, as shown in Figure 5.15. The light cone, according to the postulates of relativity, has sides at an
angle of if the time axis is measured in units of ct, and, according to the postulates of relativity, the light
cone remains the same in all inertial frames. Because the event A is arbitrary, every point in the space-time
diagram has a light cone associated with it.
206  5 · Relativity

                   Figure 5.15 The light cone consists of all the world lines followed by light from the event A at the vertex of the cone.

     Consider now the world line of a particle through space-time. Any world line outside of the cone, such as one
     passing from A through C, would involve speeds greater than c, and would therefore not be possible. Events
     such as C that lie outside the light cone are said to have a space-like separation from event A. They are
     characterized in one dimension by:

     An event like B that lies in the upper cone is reachable without exceeding the speed of light in vacuum, and is
     characterized in one dimension by

     The event is said to have a time-like separation from A. Time-like events that fall into the upper half of the light
     cone occur at greater values of t than the time of the event A at the vertex and are in the future relative to A.
     Events that have time-like separation from A and fall in the lower half of the light cone are in the past, and can
     affect the event at the origin. The region outside the light cone is labeled as neither past nor future, but rather
     as "elsewhere."
     For any event that has a space-like separation from the event at the origin, it is possible to choose a time axis
     that will make the two events occur at the same time, so that the two events are simultaneous in some frame of
     reference. Therefore, which of the events with space-like separation comes before the other in time also
     depends on the frame of reference of the observer. Since space-like separations can be traversed only by
     exceeding the speed of light; this violation of which event can cause the other provides another argument for
     why particles cannot travel faster than the speed of light, as well as potential material for science fiction about
     time travel. Similarly for any event with time-like separation from the event at the origin, a frame of reference
     can be found that will make the events occur at the same location. Because the relations

     and

     are Lorentz invariant, whether two events are time-like and can be made to occur at the same place or space-
     like and can be made to occur at the same time is the same for all observers. All observers in different inertial
     frames of reference agree on whether two events have a time-like or space-like separation.

     The twin paradox seen in space-time

     The twin paradox discussed earlier involves an astronaut twin traveling at near light speed to a distant star

system, and returning to Earth. Because of time dilation, the space twin is predicted to age much less than the
earthbound twin. This seems paradoxical because we might have expected at first glance for the relative
motion to be symmetrical and naively thought it possible to also argue that the earthbound twin should age
less.

To analyze this in terms of a space-time diagram, assume that the origin of the axes used is fixed in Earth. The
world line of the earthbound twin is then along the time axis.

The world line of the astronaut twin, who travels to the distant star and then returns, must deviate from a

straight line path in order to allow a return trip. As seen in Figure 5.16, the circumstances of the two twins are

not at all symmetrical. Their paths in space-time are of manifestly different length. Specifically, the world line

of the earthbound twin has length  which then gives the proper time that elapses for the earthbound twin

as  The distance to the distant star system is  The proper time that elapses for the space twin is

    where

This is considerably shorter than the proper time for the earthbound twin by the ratio

consistent with the time dilation formula. The twin paradox is therefore seen to be no paradox at all. The
situation of the two twins is not symmetrical in the space-time diagram. The only surprise is perhaps that the
seemingly longer path on the space-time diagram corresponds to the smaller proper time interval, because of
how and depend on and

Figure 5.16 The space twin and the earthbound twin, in the twin paradox example, follow world lines of different length through space-
time.

Lorentz transformations in space-time

We have already noted how the Lorentz transformation leaves

unchanged and corresponds to a rotation of axes in the four-dimensional space-time. If the S and frames
are in relative motion along their shared x-direction the space and time axes of are rotated by an angle as
seen from S, in the way shown in shown in Figure 5.17, where:

This differs from a rotation in the usual three-dimension sense, insofar as the two space-time axes rotate
toward each other symmetrically in a scissors-like way, as shown. The rotation of the time and space axes are
both through the same angle. The mesh of dashed lines parallel to the two axes show how coordinates of an
event would be read along the primed axes. This would be done by following a line parallel to the and one
parallel to the -axis, as shown by the dashed lines. The length scale of both axes are changed by:
208  5 · Relativity

     The line labeled  at to the x-axis corresponds to the edge of the light cone, and is unaffected by the

     Lorentz transformation, in accordance with the second postulate of relativity. The  line, and the light

     cone it represents, are the same for both the S and frame of reference.

     Figure 5.17 The Lorentz transformation results in new space and time axes rotated in a scissors-like way with respect to the original axes.

     Simultaneity

     Simultaneity of events at separated locations depends on the frame of reference used to describe them, as
     given by the scissors-like "rotation" to new time and space coordinates as described. If two events have the
     same t values in the unprimed frame of reference, they need not have the same values measured along the

                 and would then not be simultaneous in the primed frame.

     As a specific example, consider the near-light-speed train in which flash lamps at the two ends of the car have

     flashed simultaneously in the frame of reference of an observer on the ground. The space-time graph is shown

     Figure 5.18. The flashes of the two lamps are represented by the dots labeled "Left flash lamp" and "Right flash

     lamp" that lie on the light cone in the past. The world line of both pulses travel along the edge of the light cone

     to arrive at the observer on the ground simultaneously. Their arrival is the event at the origin. They therefore

     had to be emitted simultaneously in the unprimed frame, as represented by the point labeled as t(both). But

     time is measured along the        in the frame of reference of the observer seated in the middle of the train

     car. So in her frame of reference, the emission event of the bulbs labeled as (left) and (right) were not

Figure 5.18 The train example revisited. The flashes occur at the same time t(both) along the time axis of the ground observer, but at
different times, along the time axis of the passenger.

In terms of the space-time diagram, the two observers are merely using different time axes for the same events
because they are in different inertial frames, and the conclusions of both observers are equally valid. As the
analysis in terms of the space-time diagrams further suggests, the property of how simultaneity of events
depends on the frame of reference results from the properties of space and time itself, rather than from
anything specifically about electromagnetism.

Remaining in place in a kayak in a fast-moving river takes effort. The river current pulls the kayak along.
Trying to paddle against the flow can move the kayak upstream relative to the water, but that only accounts for
part of its velocity relative to the shore. The kayak's motion is an example of how velocities in Newtonian
mechanics combine by vector addition. The kayak's velocity is the vector sum of its velocity relative to the
water and the water's velocity relative to the riverbank. However, the relativistic addition of velocities is quite
different.

Velocity Transformations

Imagine a car traveling at night along a straight road, as in Figure 5.19. The driver sees the light leaving the

headlights at speed c within the car's frame of reference. If the Galilean transformation applied to light, then

the light from the car's headlights would approach the pedestrian at a speed  contrary to Einstein's

     postulates.

     Figure 5.19 According to experimental results and the second postulate of relativity, light from the car's headlights moves away from the
     car at speed c and toward the observer on the sidewalk at speed c.

     Both the distance traveled and the time of travel are different in the two frames of reference, and they must
     differ in a way that makes the speed of light the same in all inertial frames. The correct rules for transforming
     velocities from one frame to another can be obtained from the Lorentz transformation equations.

     is moving along its  at velocity v. In an increment of time , the particle is displaced by along the

     displacement in the unprimed axes:

Compare this with how the Galilean transformation of classical mechanics says the velocities transform, by
adding simply as vectors:

When the relative velocity of the frames is much smaller than the speed of light, that is, when  the

special relativity velocity addition law reduces to the Galilean velocity law. When the speed v of relative to S

is comparable to the speed of light, the relativistic velocity addition law gives a much smaller result than the

classical (Galilean) velocity addition does.

Relativistic velocity addition gives the correct result. Light leaves the ship at speed c and approaches Earth at
speed c. The speed of light is independent of the relative motion of source and observer, whether the observer
is on the ship or earthbound.

Velocities cannot add to greater than the speed of light, provided that v is less than c and does not exceed c.

As discussed in the chapter on sound, if a source of sound and a listener are moving farther apart, the listener
encounters fewer cycles of a wave in each second, and therefore lower frequency, than if their separation
remains constant. For the same reason, the listener detects a higher frequency if the source and listener are
getting closer. The resulting Doppler shift in detected frequency occurs for any form of wave. For sound waves,
however, the equations for the Doppler shift differ markedly depending on whether it is the source, the
observer, or the air, which is moving. Light requires no medium, and the Doppler shift for light traveling in
vacuum depends only on the relative speed of the observer and source.

The Relativistic Doppler Effect

Suppose an observer in S sees light from a source in moving away at velocity v (Figure 5.22). The
wavelength of the light could be measured within --for example, by using a mirror to set up standing waves
and measuring the distance between nodes. These distances are proper lengths with as their rest frame,

and change by a factor  when measured in the observer's frame S, where the ruler measuring the

wavelength in is seen as moving.

     Figure 5.22 (a) When a light wave is emitted by a source fixed in the moving inertial frame the observer in S sees the wavelength

     measured in to be shorter by a factor  (b) Because the observer sees the source moving away within S, the wave pattern

     reaching the observer in S is also stretched by the factor

     If the source were stationary in S, the observer would see a length of the wave pattern in time But
     because of the motion of relative to S, considered solely within S, the observer sees the wave pattern, and
     therefore the wavelength, stretched out by a factor of

     as illustrated in (b) of Figure 5.22. The overall increase from both effects gives

     where is the wavelength of the light seen by the source in and  is the wavelength that the observer
     detects within S.

     Red Shifts and Blue Shifts

     The observed wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is longer (called a "red shift") than that emitted by
     the source when the source moves away from the observer. Similarly, the wavelength is shorter (called a "blue
     shift") when the source moves toward the observer. The amount of change is determined by

     where is the wavelength in the frame of reference of the source, and v is the relative velocity of the two
     frames S and The velocity v is positive for motion away from an observer and negative for motion toward an
     observer. In terms of source frequency and observed frequency, this equation can be written as

Suppose a galaxy is moving away from Earth at a speed 0.825c. It emits radio waves with a wavelength of
0.525 m. What wavelength would we detect on Earth?

Because the galaxy is moving at a relativistic speed, we must determine the Doppler shift of the radio waves
using the relativistic Doppler shift instead of the classical Doppler shift.

Significance
Because the galaxy is moving away from Earth, we expect the wavelengths of radiation it emits to be
redshifted. The wavelength we calculated is 1.70 m, which is redshifted from the original wavelength of 0.525
m. You will see in Particle Physics and Cosmology that detecting redshifted radiation led to present-day
understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe.

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Define relativistic momentum in terms of mass and velocity
      · Show how relativistic momentum relates to classical momentum
      · Show how conservation of relativistic momentum limits objects with mass to speeds less than

     Momentum is a central concept in physics. The broadest form of Newton's second law is stated in terms of
     momentum. Momentum is conserved whenever the net external force on a system is zero. This makes
     momentum conservation a fundamental tool for analyzing collisions (Figure 5.23). Much of what we know
     about subatomic structure comes from the analysis of collisions of accelerator-produced relativistic particles,
     and momentum conservation plays a crucial role in this analysis.

     Figure 5.23 Momentum is an important concept for these football players from the University of California at Berkeley and the University
     of California at Davis. A player with the same velocity but greater mass collides with greater impact because his momentum is greater. For
     objects moving at relativistic speeds, the effect is even greater.

     The first postulate of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Does the law of
     conservation of momentum survive this requirement at high velocities? It can be shown that the momentum

     calculated as merely  even if it is conserved in one frame of reference, may not be conserved in

     another after applying the Lorentz transformation to the velocities. The correct equation for momentum can
     be shown, instead, to be the classical expression in terms of the increment of proper time of the particle,
     observed in the particle's rest frame:

       Relativistic Momentum

       Relativistic momentum is classical momentum multiplied by the relativistic factor :
                                                                                                                                                         5.6

where m is the rest mass of the object, is its velocity relative to an observer, and  is the relativistic
factor:

                                                                                                                   5.7

Note that we use u for velocity here to distinguish it from relative velocity v between observers. The factor
that occurs here has the same form as the previous relativistic factor except that it is now in terms of the
velocity of the particle u instead of the relative velocity v of two frames of reference.

With p expressed in this way, total momentum is conserved whenever the net external force is zero, just as
in classical physics. Again we see that the relativistic quantity becomes virtually the same as the classical
quantity at low velocities, where u/c is small and is very nearly equal to 1. Relativistic momentum has the
same intuitive role as classical momentum. It is greatest for large masses moving at high velocities, but
because of the factor relativistic momentum approaches infinity as u approaches c (Figure 5.24). This is
another indication that an object with mass cannot reach the speed of light. If it did, its momentum would
become infinite--an unreasonable value.

Figure 5.24 Relativistic momentum approaches infinity as the velocity of an object approaches the speed of light.

The relativistically correct definition of momentum as  is sometimes taken to imply that mass varies

with velocity:  particularly in older textbooks. However, note that m is the mass of the object as

measured by a person at rest relative to the object. Thus, m is defined to be the rest mass, which could be

measured at rest, perhaps using gravity. When a mass is moving relative to an observer, the only way that its

mass can be determined is through collisions or other means involving momentum. Because the mass of a

moving object cannot be determined independently of momentum, the only meaningful mass is rest mass.

Therefore, when we use the term "mass," assume it to be identical to "rest mass."

Relativistic momentum is defined in such a way that conservation of momentum holds in all inertial frames.
Whenever the net external force on a system is zero, relativistic momentum is conserved, just as is the case for
classical momentum. This has been verified in numerous experiments.

     The tokamak in Figure 5.25 is a form of experimental fusion reactor, which can change mass to energy.
     Nuclear reactors are proof of the relationship between energy and matter.

     Conservation of energy is one of the most important laws in physics. Not only does energy have many
     important forms, but each form can be converted to any other. We know that classically, the total amount of
     energy in a system remains constant. Relativistically, energy is still conserved, but energy-mass equivalence
     must now be taken into account, for example, in the reactions that occur within a nuclear reactor. Relativistic
     energy is intentionally defined so that it is conserved in all inertial frames, just as is the case for relativistic
     momentum. As a consequence, several fundamental quantities are related in ways not known in classical
     physics. All of these relationships have been verified by experimental results and have fundamental
     consequences. The altered definition of energy contains some of the most fundamental and spectacular new
     insights into nature in recent history.

     Kinetic Energy and the Ultimate Speed Limit

     The first postulate of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Einstein
     showed that the law of conservation of energy of a particle is valid relativistically, but for energy expressed in
     terms of velocity and mass in a way consistent with relativity.

     Consider first the relativistic expression for the kinetic energy. We again use u for velocity to distinguish it
     from relative velocity v between observers. Classically, kinetic energy is related to mass and speed by the

     familiar expression               The corresponding relativistic expression for kinetic energy can be obtained

     from the work-energy theorem. This theorem states that the net work on a system goes into kinetic energy.

     Specifically, if a force, expressed as  accelerates a particle from rest to its final velocity, the

     work done on the particle should be equal to its final kinetic energy. In mathematical form, for one-

When an object is motionless, its speed is  and

some cases, as in the limit of small speed here, most terms are very small. Thus, the expression derived here
for is not exact, but it is a very accurate approximation. Therefore, at low speed:

     Entering this into the expression for relativistic kinetic energy gives

     That is, relativistic kinetic energy becomes the same as classical kinetic energy when
     It is even more interesting to investigate what happens to kinetic energy when the speed of an object
     approaches the speed of light. We know that becomes infinite as u approaches c, so that also becomes
     infinite as the velocity approaches the speed of light (Figure 5.26). The increase in is far larger than in

              as v approaches c. An infinite amount of work (and, hence, an infinite amount of energy input) is
     required to accelerate a mass to the speed of light.

       The Speed of Light

       No object with mass can attain the speed of light.

     The speed of light is the ultimate speed limit for any particle having mass. All of this is consistent with the fact
     that velocities less than c always add to less than c. Both the relativistic form for kinetic energy and the
     ultimate speed limit being c have been confirmed in detail in numerous experiments. No matter how much
     energy is put into accelerating a mass, its velocity can only approach--not reach--the speed of light.

Significance

As might be expected, because the velocity is 99.0% of the speed of light, the classical kinetic energy differs

significantly from the correct relativistic value. Note also that the classical value is much smaller than the

relativistic value. In fact,           in this case. This illustrates how difficult it is to get a mass moving

close to the speed of light. Much more energy is needed than predicted classically. Ever-increasing amounts of

energy are needed to get the velocity of a mass a little closer to that of light. An energy of 3 MeV is a very small

amount for an electron, and it can be achieved with present-day particle accelerators. SLAC, for example, can

accelerate electrons to over

Is there any point in getting v a little closer to c than 99.0% or 99.9%? The answer is yes. We learn a great deal
by doing this. The energy that goes into a high-velocity mass can be converted into any other form, including
into entirely new particles. In the Large Hadron Collider in Figure 5.27, charged particles are accelerated
222  5 · Relativity

     before entering the ring-like structure. There, two beams of particles are accelerated to their final speed of
     about 99.7% the speed of light in opposite directions, and made to collide, producing totally new species of
     particles. Most of what we know about the substructure of matter and the collection of exotic short-lived
     particles in nature has been learned this way. Patterns in the characteristics of these previously unknown
     particles hint at a basic substructure for all matter. These particles and some of their characteristics will be
     discussed in a later chapter on particle physics.

     Total Relativistic Energy

     The expression for kinetic energy can be rearranged to:

     Einstein argued in a separate article, also later published in 1905, that if the energy of a particle changes by

     its mass changes by               Abundant experimental evidence since then confirms that

     corresponds to the energy that the particle of mass m has when at rest. For example, when a neutral pion of

     mass m at rest decays into two photons, the photons have zero mass but are observed to have total energy

     corresponding to for the pion. Similarly, when a particle of mass m decays into two or more particles with

     smaller total mass, the observed kinetic energy imparted to the products of the decay corresponds to the

     decrease in mass. Thus, E is the total relativistic energy of the particle, and is its rest energy.

  Rest energy of an object is

This is the correct form of Einstein's most famous equation, which for the first time showed that energy is
related to the mass of an object at rest. For example, if energy is stored in the object, its rest mass increases.
This also implies that mass can be destroyed to release energy. The implications of these first two equations
regarding relativistic energy are so broad that they were not completely recognized for some years after
Einstein published them in 1905, nor was the experimental proof that they are correct widely recognized at
first. Einstein, it should be noted, did understand and describe the meanings and implications of his theory.

        EXAMPLE 5.13

Calculating Rest Energy

Calculate the rest energy of a 1.00-g mass.

e. Convert units. Noting that  we see the rest energy is:

Significance

This is an enormous amount of energy for a 1.00-g mass. Rest energy is large because the speed of light c is a
large number and is a very large number, so that is huge for any macroscopic mass. The
rest mass energy for 1.00 g is about twice the energy released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb and about
10,000 times the kinetic energy of a large aircraft carrier.

Today, the practical applications of the conversion of mass into another form of energy, such as in nuclear
weapons and nuclear power plants, are well known. But examples also existed when Einstein first proposed
the correct form of relativistic energy, and he did describe some of them. Nuclear radiation had been
discovered in the previous decade, and it had been a mystery as to where its energy originated. The
explanation was that, in some nuclear processes, a small amount of mass is destroyed and energy is released
and carried by nuclear radiation. But the amount of mass destroyed is so small that it is difficult to detect that
any is missing. Although Einstein proposed this as the source of energy in the radioactive salts then being
studied, it was many years before there was broad recognition that mass could be and, in fact, commonly is,
converted to energy (Figure 5.28).

     the electric station via nuclear fission. (credit a: modification of work by NASA/SDO (AIA) )

     Because of the relationship of rest energy to mass, we now consider mass to be a form of energy rather than
     something separate. There had not been even a hint of this prior to Einstein's work. Energy-mass equivalence
     is now known to be the source of the sun's energy, the energy of nuclear decay, and even one of the sources of
     energy keeping Earth's interior hot.

     Stored Energy and Potential Energy

     What happens to energy stored in an object at rest, such as the energy put into a battery by charging it, or the
     energy stored in a toy gun's compressed spring? The energy input becomes part of the total energy of the
     object and thus increases its rest mass. All stored and potential energy becomes mass in a system. In seeming
     contradiction, the principle of conservation of mass (meaning total mass is constant) was one of the great laws
     verified by nineteenth-century science. Why was it not noticed to be incorrect? The following example helps
     answer this question.

     of the chemical reactants enter or leave the battery. (b) What percent increase is this, given that the battery's

     mass is 20.0 kg?

     Strategy

     In part (a), we first must find the energy stored as chemical energy  in the battery, which equals the

     electrical energy the battery can provide. Because          we have to calculate the charge q in

     which is the product of the current I and the time t. We then multiply the result by 12.0 V. We can then

b. Identify the unknown: % change.
 c. Express the answer as an equation:

Significance

Both the actual increase in mass and the percent increase are very small, because energy is divided by a

very large number. We would have to be able to measure the mass of the battery to a precision of a billionth of a

percent, or 1 part in  to notice this increase. It is no wonder that the mass variation is not readily

observed. In fact, this change in mass is so small that we may question how anyone could verify that it is real.

The answer is found in nuclear processes in which the percentage of mass destroyed is large enough to be

measured accurately. The mass of the fuel of a nuclear reactor, for example, is measurably smaller when its

energy has been used. In that case, stored energy has been released (converted mostly into thermal energy to

power electric generators) and the rest mass has decreased. A decrease in mass also occurs from using the

energy stored in a battery, except that the stored energy is much greater in nuclear processes, making the

change in mass measurable in practice as well as in theory.

Relativistic Energy and Momentum

We know classically that kinetic energy and momentum are related to each other, because:

Relativistically, we can obtain a relationship between energy and momentum by algebraically manipulating
their defining equations. This yields:

                                                                                                                                                     5.11

where E is the relativistic total energy,                    and p is the relativistic momentum. This
226  5 · Relativity

     relationship between relativistic energy and relativistic momentum is more complicated than the classical
     version, but we can gain some interesting new insights by examining it. First, total energy is related to
     momentum and rest mass. At rest, momentum is zero, and the equation gives the total energy to be the rest
     energy (so this equation is consistent with the discussion of rest energy above). However, as the mass is
     accelerated, its momentum p increases, thus increasing the total energy. At sufficiently high velocities, the rest

     energy term     becomes negligible compared with the momentum term  thus,  at extremely

     relativistic velocities.

     If we consider momentum p to be distinct from mass, we can determine the implications of the equation

                                   for a particle that has no mass. If we take m to be zero in this equation, then
                                Massless particles have this momentum. There are several massless particles found in
     nature, including photons (which are packets of electromagnetic radiation). Another implication is that a
     massless particle must travel at speed c and only at speed c. It is beyond the scope of this text to examine the

     relationship in the equation         in detail, but you can see that the relationship has important
     implications in special relativity.

6.5 De Broglie's Matter Waves
6.6 Wave-Particle Duality
INTRODUCTION Two of the most revolutionary concepts of the twentieth century were the description of
light as a collection of particles, and the treatment of particles as waves. These wave properties of matter have
led to the discovery of technologies such as electron microscopy, which allows us to examine submicroscopic
objects such as grains of pollen, as shown above.
In this chapter, you will learn about the energy quantum, a concept that was introduced in 1900 by the German
physicist Max Planck to explain blackbody radiation. We discuss how Albert Einstein extended Planck's
240  6 · Photons and Matter Waves

     concept to a quantum of light (a "photon") to explain the photoelectric effect. We also show how American
     physicist Arthur H. Compton used the photon concept in 1923 to explain wavelength shifts observed in X-rays.
     After a discussion of Bohr's model of hydrogen, we describe how matter waves were postulated in 1924 by
     Louis-Victor de Broglie to justify Bohr's model and we examine the experiments conducted in 1923-1927 by
     Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer that confirmed the existence of de Broglie's matter waves.

     6.1 Blackbody Radiation

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Apply Wien's and Stefan's laws to analyze radiation emitted by a blackbody
      · Explain Planck's hypothesis of energy quanta

     All bodies emit electromagnetic radiation over a range of wavelengths. In an earlier chapter, we learned that a
     cooler body radiates less energy than a warmer body. We also know by observation that when a body is heated
     and its temperature rises, the perceived wavelength of its emitted radiation changes from infrared to red, and
     then from red to orange, and so forth. As its temperature rises, the body glows with the colors corresponding to
     ever-smaller wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is the underlying principle of the
     incandescent light bulb: A hot metal filament glows red, and when heating continues, its glow eventually
     covers the entire visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The temperature (T) of the object that emits
     radiation, or the emitter, determines the wavelength at which the radiated energy is at its maximum. For
     example, the Sun, whose surface temperature is in the range between 5000 K and 6000 K, radiates most
     strongly in a range of wavelengths about 560 nm in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Your
     body, when at its normal temperature of about 300 K, radiates most strongly in the infrared part of the
     spectrum.

     Radiation that is incident on an object is partially absorbed and partially reflected. At thermodynamic
     equilibrium, the rate at which an object absorbs radiation is the same as the rate at which it emits it. Therefore,
     a good absorber of radiation (any object that absorbs radiation) is also a good emitter. A perfect absorber
     absorbs all electromagnetic radiation incident on it; such an object is called a blackbody.

     Although the blackbody is an idealization, because no physical object absorbs 100% of incident radiation, we
     can construct a close realization of a blackbody in the form of a small hole in the wall of a sealed enclosure
     known as a cavity radiator, as shown in Figure 6.2. The inside walls of a cavity radiator are rough and
     blackened so that any radiation that enters through a tiny hole in the cavity wall becomes trapped inside the
     cavity. At thermodynamic equilibrium (at temperature T), the cavity walls absorb exactly as much radiation as
     they emit. Furthermore, inside the cavity, the radiation entering the hole is balanced by the radiation leaving it.
     The emission spectrum of a blackbody can be obtained by analyzing the light radiating from the hole.
     Electromagnetic waves emitted by a blackbody are called blackbody radiation.

                  Figure 6.2 A blackbody is physically realized by a small hole in the wall of a cavity radiator.

The intensity     of blackbody radiation depends on the wavelength of the emitted radiation and on the

temperature T of the blackbody (Figure 6.3). The function  is the power intensity that is radiated per

unit wavelength; in other words, it is the power radiated per unit area of the hole in a cavity radiator per unit

wavelength. According to this definition,    is the power per unit area that is emitted in the wavelength

interval from to  The intensity distribution among wavelengths of radiation emitted by cavities was

studied experimentally at the end of the nineteenth century. Generally, radiation emitted by materials only

approximately follows the blackbody radiation curve (Figure 6.4); however, spectra of common stars do follow

the blackbody radiation curve very closely.

blackbody temperature, starting with a low temperature (the lowest curve) to a high temperature (the highest curve).

     Two important laws summarize the experimental findings of blackbody radiation: Wien's displacement law
     and Stefan's law. Wien's displacement law is illustrated in Figure 6.3 by the curve connecting the maxima on
     the intensity curves. In these curves, we see that the hotter the body, the shorter the wavelength corresponding
     to the emission peak in the radiation curve. Quantitatively, Wien's law reads

                                                                                                         6.1

     where     is the position of the maximum in the radiation curve. In other words,  is the wavelength at

     which a blackbody radiates most strongly at a given temperature T. Note that in Equation 6.1, the temperature

     is in kelvins. Wien's displacement law allows us to estimate the temperatures of distant stars by measuring the

     wavelength of radiation they emit.

            EXAMPLE 6.1

     Temperatures of Distant Stars

     On a clear evening during the winter months, if you happen to be in the Northern Hemisphere and look up at
     the sky, you can see the constellation Orion (The Hunter). One star in this constellation, Rigel, flickers in a blue
     color and another star, Betelgeuse, has a reddish color, as shown in Figure 6.5. Which of these two stars is
     cooler, Betelgeuse or Rigel?

     Strategy

     We treat each star as a blackbody. Then according to Wien's law, its temperature is inversely proportional to

     the wavelength of its peak intensity. The wavelength  of blue light is shorter than the wavelength             of

     red light. Even if we do not know the precise wavelengths, we can still set up a proportion.

     Solution
     Writing Wien's law for the blue star and for the red star, we have

                                                                                                         6.2

                                                                                                                                                       6.3

Therefore, Betelgeuse is cooler than Rigel.
Significance
Note that Wien's displacement law tells us that the higher the temperature of an emitting body, the shorter the
wavelength of the radiation it emits. The qualitative analysis presented in this example is generally valid for
any emitting body, whether it is a big object such as a star or a small object such as the glowing filament in an
incandescent lightbulb.

The second experimental relation is Stefan's law, which concerns the total power of blackbody radiation
emitted across the entire spectrum of wavelengths at a given temperature. In Figure 6.3, this total power is
represented by the area under the blackbody radiation curve for a given T. As the temperature of a blackbody
increases, the total emitted power also increases. Quantitatively, Stefan's law expresses this relation as

                                                                          6.4

     EXAMPLE 6.2

     Power Radiated by Stars

     A star such as our Sun will eventually evolve to a "red giant" star and then to a "white dwarf" star. A typical

     white dwarf is approximately the size of Earth, and its surface temperature is about       A typical red

     giant has a surface temperature of  and a radius ~100,000 times larger than that of a white dwarf.

     What is the average radiated power per unit area and the total power radiated by each of these types of stars?

     How do they compare?

     Strategy

     If we treat the star as a blackbody, then according to Stefan's law, the total power that the star radiates is

     proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. To find the power radiated per unit area of the surface, we

     do not need to make any assumptions about the shape of the star because P/A depends only on temperature.

     However, to compute the total power, we need to make an assumption that the energy radiates through a

     spherical surface enclosing the star, so that the surface area is  where R is its radius.

     Solution
     A simple proportion based on Stefan's law gives

                                                                                                                      6.5

     The power emitted per unit area by a white dwarf is about 5000 times that the power emitted by a red giant.

     Denoting this ratio by              Equation 6.5 gives

                                                                                                                      6.6

     We see that the total power emitted by a white dwarf is a tiny fraction of the total power emitted by a red giant.
     Despite its relatively lower temperature, the overall power radiated by a red giant far exceeds that of the white
     dwarf because the red giant has a much larger surface area. To estimate the absolute value of the emitted
     power per unit area, we again use Stefan's law. For the white dwarf, we obtain

                                                                                                                                                            6.7

     The analogous result for the red giant is obtained by scaling the result for a white dwarf:

                                                                                                                                                            6.8

     Significance
     To estimate the total power emitted by a white dwarf, in principle, we could use Equation 6.7. However, to find
     its surface area, we need to know the average radius, which is not given in this example. Therefore, the
     solution stops here. The same is also true for the red giant star.

Suppose that two stars, and radiate exactly the same total power. If the radius of star is three times that of
star what is the ratio of the surface temperatures of these stars? Which one is hotter?

The term "blackbody" was coined by Gustav R. Kirchhoff in 1862. The blackbody radiation curve was known
experimentally, but its shape eluded physical explanation until the year 1900. The physical model of a
blackbody at temperature T is that of the electromagnetic waves enclosed in a cavity (see Figure 6.2) and at
thermodynamic equilibrium with the cavity walls. The waves can exchange energy with the walls. The
objective here is to find the energy density distribution among various modes of vibration at various
wavelengths (or frequencies). In other words, we want to know how much energy is carried by a single
wavelength or a band of wavelengths. Once we know the energy distribution, we can use standard statistical
methods (similar to those studied in a previous chapter) to obtain the blackbody radiation curve, Stefan's law,
and Wien's displacement law. When the physical model is correct, the theoretical predictions should be the
same as the experimental curves.

In a classical approach to the blackbody radiation problem, in which radiation is treated as waves (as you have
studied in previous chapters), the modes of electromagnetic waves trapped in the cavity are in equilibrium and
continually exchange their energies with the cavity walls. There is no physical reason why a wave should do
otherwise: Any amount of energy can be exchanged, either by being transferred from the wave to the material
in the wall or by being received by the wave from the material in the wall. This classical picture is the basis of
the model developed by Lord Rayleigh and, independently, by Sir James Jeans. The result of this classical
model for blackbody radiation curves is known as the Rayleigh-Jeans law. However, as shown in Figure 6.6,
the Rayleigh-Jeans law fails to correctly reproduce experimental results. In the limit of short wavelengths, the
Rayleigh-Jeans law predicts infinite radiation intensity, which is inconsistent with the experimental results in
which radiation intensity has finite values in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. This divergence between
the results of classical theory and experiments, which came to be called the ultraviolet catastrophe, shows how
classical physics fails to explain the mechanism of blackbody radiation.

        Figure 6.6 The ultraviolet catastrophe: The Rayleigh-Jeans law does not explain the observed blackbody emission spectrum.

The blackbody radiation problem was solved in 1900 by Max Planck. Planck used the same idea as the
Rayleigh-Jeans model in the sense that he treated the electromagnetic waves between the walls inside the
cavity classically, and assumed that the radiation is in equilibrium with the cavity walls. The innovative idea
that Planck introduced in his model is the assumption that the cavity radiation originates from atomic
oscillations inside the cavity walls, and that these oscillations can have only discrete values of energy.
Therefore, the radiation trapped inside the cavity walls can exchange energy with the walls only in discrete
amounts. Planck's hypothesis of discrete energy values, which he called quanta, assumes that the oscillators
inside the cavity walls have quantized energies. This was a brand new idea that went beyond the classical
physics of the nineteenth century because, as you learned in a previous chapter, in the classical picture, the
energy of an oscillator can take on any continuous value. Planck assumed that the energy of an oscillator ( )
can have only discrete, or quantized, values:
246  6 · Photons and Matter Waves

                                                                                                                   6.9

     In Equation 6.9, f is the frequency of Planck's oscillator. The natural number n that enumerates these discrete
     energies is called a quantum number. The physical constant h is called Planck's constant:

                                                                                                                6.10

     Each discrete energy value corresponds to a quantum state of a Planck oscillator. Quantum states are

     enumerated by quantum numbers. For example, when Planck's oscillator is in its first     quantum state, its

     energy is       when it is in the             quantum state, its energy is  when it is in the

     quantum state,                    and so on.

     Note that Equation 6.9 shows that there are infinitely many quantum states, which can be represented as a

     sequence {hf, 2hf, 3hf,..., (n - 1)hf, nhf, (n + 1)hf,...}. Each two consecutive quantum states in this sequence are

     separated by an energy jump,                  An oscillator in the wall can receive energy from the radiation in the

     cavity (absorption), or it can give away energy to the radiation in the cavity (emission). The absorption process

     sends the oscillator to a higher quantum state, and the emission process sends the oscillator to a lower

     quantum state. Whichever way this exchange of energy goes, the smallest amount of energy that can be

     exchanged is hf. There is no upper limit to how much energy can be exchanged, but whatever is exchanged

     must be an integer multiple of hf. If the energy packet does not have this exact amount, it is neither absorbed

     nor emitted at the wall of the blackbody.

     Planck's Quantum Hypothesis

     Planck's hypothesis of energy quanta states that the amount of energy emitted by the oscillator is carried
     by the quantum of radiation,

     Recall that the frequency of electromagnetic radiation is related to its wavelength and to the speed of light by

     the fundamental relation          This means that we can express Equation 6.10 equivalently in terms of

     wavelength When included in the computation of the energy density of a blackbody, Planck's hypothesis

     gives the following theoretical expression for the power intensity of emitted radiation per unit wavelength:

                                                                                                                6.11

     where c is the speed of light in vacuum and is Boltzmann's constant,                           The

     theoretical formula expressed in Equation 6.11 is called Planck's blackbody radiation law. This law is in

     agreement with the experimental blackbody radiation curve (see Figure 6.7). In addition, Wien's displacement

     law and Stefan's law can both be derived from Equation 6.11. To derive Wien's displacement law, we use

     differential calculus to find the maximum of the radiation intensity curve  To derive Stefan's law and

     find the value of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, we use integral calculus and integrate      to find the total

     power radiated by a blackbody at one temperature in the entire spectrum of wavelengths from    to

     Would the result in Example 6.4 be different if the mass were not 1.0 kg but a tiny mass of 1.0 µg, and the
     amplitude of vibrations were 0.10 µm?

     When Planck first published his result, the hypothesis of energy quanta was not taken seriously by the physics
     community because it did not follow from any established physics theory at that time. It was perceived, even
     by Planck himself, as a useful mathematical trick that led to a good theoretical "fit" to the experimental curve.
     This perception was changed in 1905 when Einstein published his explanation of the photoelectric effect, in
     which he gave Planck's energy quantum a new meaning: that of a particle of light.

     6.2 Photoelectric Effect

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe physical characteristics of the photoelectric effect
      · Explain why the photoelectric effect cannot be explained by classical physics
      · Describe how Einstein's idea of a particle of radiation explains the photoelectric effect

     When a metal surface is exposed to a monochromatic electromagnetic wave of sufficiently short wavelength
     (or equivalently, above a threshold frequency), the incident radiation is absorbed and the exposed surface
     emits electrons. This phenomenon is known as the photoelectric effect. Electrons that are emitted in this
     process are called photoelectrons.

     The experimental setup to study the photoelectric effect is shown schematically in Figure 6.8. The target
     material serves as the cathode, which becomes the emitter of photoelectrons when it is illuminated by
     monochromatic radiation. We call this electrode the photoelectrode. Photoelectrons are collected at the
     anode, which is kept at a higher potential with respect to the cathode. The potential difference between the
     electrodes can be increased or decreased, or its polarity can be reversed. The electrodes are enclosed in an
     evacuated glass tube so that photoelectrons do not lose their kinetic energy on collisions with air molecules in
     the space between electrodes.

     When the target material is not exposed to radiation, no current is registered in this circuit because the circuit
     is broken (note, there is a gap between the electrodes). But when the target material is connected to the
     negative terminal of a battery and exposed to radiation, a current is registered in this circuit; this current is

called the photocurrent. Suppose that we now reverse the potential difference between the electrodes so that
the target material now connects with the positive terminal of a battery, and then we slowly increase the
voltage. The photocurrent gradually dies out and eventually stops flowing completely at some value of this
reversed voltage. The potential difference at which the photocurrent stops flowing is called the stopping
potential.

voltmeter measures the electric potential difference between the electrodes, and the ammeter measures the photocurrent. The incident
radiation is monochromatic.

Characteristics of the Photoelectric Effect

The photoelectric effect has three important characteristics that cannot be explained by classical physics: (1)
the absence of a lag time, (2) the independence of the kinetic energy of photoelectrons on the intensity of
incident radiation, and (3) the presence of a cut-off frequency. Let's examine each of these characteristics.

The absence of lag time

When radiation strikes the target material in the electrode, electrons are emitted almost instantaneously, even
at very low intensities of incident radiation. This absence of lag time contradicts our understanding based on
classical physics. Classical physics predicts that for low-energy radiation, it would take significant time before
irradiated electrons could gain sufficient energy to leave the electrode surface; however, such an energy
buildup is not observed.

The intensity of incident radiation and the kinetic energy of photoelectrons

Typical experimental curves are shown in Figure 6.9, in which the photocurrent is plotted versus the applied
potential difference between the electrodes. For the positive potential difference, the current steadily grows
until it reaches a plateau. Furthering the potential increase beyond this point does not increase the
photocurrent at all. A higher intensity of radiation produces a higher value of photocurrent. For the negative
potential difference, as the absolute value of the potential difference increases, the value of the photocurrent
decreases and becomes zero at the stopping potential. For any intensity of incident radiation, whether the
intensity is high or low, the value of the stopping potential always stays at one value.
250  6 · Photons and Matter Waves

     To understand why this result is unusual from the point of view of classical physics, we first have to analyze the

     energy of photoelectrons. A photoelectron that leaves the surface has kinetic energy K. It gained this energy

     from the incident electromagnetic wave. In the space between the electrodes, a photoelectron moves in the

     electric potential and its energy changes by the amount  where is the potential difference and

     Because no forces are present but electric force, by applying the work-energy theorem, we obtain the energy

     balance  for the photoelectron, where is the change in the photoelectron's kinetic energy.

     When the stopping potential       is applied, the photoelectron loses its initial kinetic energy and comes

     to rest. Thus, its energy balance becomes                so that  In the presence of the

     stopping potential, the largest kinetic energy  that a photoelectron can have is its initial kinetic energy,

     which it has at the surface of the photoelectrode. Therefore, the largest kinetic energy of photoelectrons can be

     directly measured by measuring the stopping potential:

                                                                                                     6.12

     At this point we can see where the classical theory is at odds with the experimental results. In classical theory,
     the photoelectron absorbs electromagnetic energy in a continuous way; this means that when the incident
     radiation has a high intensity, the kinetic energy in Equation 6.12 is expected to be high. Similarly, when the
     radiation has a low intensity, the kinetic energy is expected to be low. But the experiment shows that the
     maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons is independent of the light intensity.

     Figure 6.9 The detected photocurrent plotted versus the applied potential difference shows that for any intensity of incident radiation,

     whether the intensity is high (upper curve) or low (lower curve), the value of the stopping potential is always the same.

     The presence of a cut-off frequency

     For any metal surface, there is a minimum frequency of incident radiation below which photocurrent does not
     occur. The value of this cut-off frequency for the photoelectric effect is a physical property of the metal:
     Different materials have different values of cut-off frequency. Experimental data show a typical linear trend
     (see Figure 6.10). The kinetic energy of photoelectrons at the surface grows linearly with the increasing
     frequency of incident radiation. Measurements for all metal surfaces give linear plots with one slope. None of
     these observed phenomena is in accord with the classical understanding of nature. According to the classical
     description, the kinetic energy of photoelectrons should not depend on the frequency of incident radiation at
     all, and there should be no cut-off frequency. Instead, in the classical picture, electrons receive energy from
     the incident electromagnetic wave in a continuous way, and the amount of energy they receive depends only
     on the intensity of the incident light and nothing else. So in the classical understanding, as long as the light is
     shining, the photoelectric effect is expected to continue.

occur above the cut-off frequency Measurements for all metal surfaces give linear plots with one slope. Each metal surface has its own
cut-off frequency.

The Work Function

The photoelectric effect was explained in 1905 by A. Einstein. Einstein reasoned that if Planck's hypothesis
about energy quanta was correct for describing the energy exchange between electromagnetic radiation and
cavity walls, it should also work to describe energy absorption from electromagnetic radiation by the surface of
a photoelectrode. He postulated that an electromagnetic wave carries its energy in discrete packets. Einstein's
postulate goes beyond Planck's hypothesis because it states that the light itself consists of energy quanta. In
other words, it states that electromagnetic waves are quantized.

In Einstein's approach, a beam of monochromatic light of frequency f is made of photons. A photon is a
particle of light. Each photon moves at the speed of light and carries an energy quantum A photon's energy
depends only on its frequency f. Explicitly, the energy of a photon is

                                                                                                                                                     6.13

where is Planck's constant. In the photoelectric effect, photons arrive at the metal surface and each photon
gives away all of its energy to only one electron on the metal surface. This transfer of energy from photon to
electron is of the "all or nothing" type, and there are no fractional transfers in which a photon would lose only
part of its energy and survive. The essence of a quantum phenomenon is either a photon transfers its entire
energy and ceases to exist or there is no transfer at all. This is in contrast with the classical picture, where
fractional energy transfers are permitted. Having this quantum understanding, the energy balance for an
electron on the surface that receives the energy from a photon is

where  is the kinetic energy, given by Equation 6.12, that an electron has at the very instant it gets

detached from the surface. In this energy balance equation, is the energy needed to detach a photoelectron

from the surface. This energy is called the work function of the metal. Each metal has its characteristic work

function, as illustrated in Table 6.1. To obtain the kinetic energy of photoelectrons at the surface, we simply

invert the energy balance equation and use Equation 6.13 to express the energy of the absorbed photon. This

gives us the expression for the kinetic energy of photoelectrons, which explicitly depends on the frequency of

incident radiation:

                                                                                                        6.14

This equation has a simple mathematical form but its physics is profound. We can now elaborate on the
physical meaning behind Equation 6.14.

                        Table 6.1

     In Einstein's interpretation, interactions take place between individual electrons and individual photons. The
     absence of a lag time means that these one-on-one interactions occur instantaneously. This interaction time
     cannot be increased by lowering the light intensity. The light intensity corresponds to the number of photons
     arriving at the metal surface per unit time. Even at very low light intensities, the photoelectric effect still
     occurs because the interaction is between one electron and one photon. As long as there is at least one photon
     with enough energy to transfer it to a bound electron, a photoelectron will appear on the surface of the
     photoelectrode.

     The existence of the cut-off frequency for the photoelectric effect follows from Equation 6.14 because the

     kinetic energy     of the photoelectron can take only positive values. This means that there must be some

     threshold frequency for which the kinetic energy is zero,        In this way, we obtain the explicit

     formula for cut-off frequency:

                                                                                                           6.15

     Cut-off frequency depends only on the work function of the metal and is in direct proportion to it. When the

     work function is large (when electrons are bound fast to the metal surface), the energy of the threshold photon

     must be large to produce a photoelectron, and then the corresponding threshold frequency is large. Photons

     with frequencies larger than the threshold frequency always produce photoelectrons because they have

               Photons with frequencies smaller than do not have enough energy to produce photoelectrons.

     Therefore, when incident radiation has a frequency below the cut-off frequency, the photoelectric effect is not

     observed. Because frequency f and wavelength of electromagnetic waves are related by the fundamental

     relation        (where is the speed of light in vacuum), the cut-off frequency has its corresponding cut-off

     wavelength

                                                                                                           6.16

     In this equation,                 Our observations can be restated in the following equivalent way: When

     the incident radiation has wavelengths longer than the cut-off wavelength, the photoelectric effect does not

     occur.

EXAMPLE 6.5

Photoelectric Effect for Silver

Radiation with wavelength 300 nm is incident on a silver surface. Will photoelectrons be observed?

Strategy

Photoelectrons can be ejected from the metal surface only when the incident radiation has a shorter

wavelength than the cut-off wavelength. The work function of silver is        (Table 6.1). To make the

estimate, we use Equation 6.16.

Solution
The threshold wavelength for observing the photoelectric effect in silver is

The incident radiation has wavelength 300 nm, which is longer than the cut-off wavelength; therefore,
photoelectrons are not observed.

Significance
If the photoelectrode were made of sodium instead of silver, the cut-off wavelength would be 504 nm and
photoelectrons would be observed.

Equation 6.14 in Einstein's model tells us that the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons is a linear

function of the frequency of incident radiation, which is illustrated in Figure 6.10. For any metal, the slope of

this plot has a value of Planck's constant. The intercept with the      -axis gives us a value of the work

function that is characteristic for the metal. On the other hand,   can be directly measured in the

experiment by measuring the value of the stopping potential (see Equation 6.12) at which the

photocurrent stops. These direct measurements allow us to determine experimentally the value of Planck's

constant, as well as work functions of materials.

Einstein's model also gives a straightforward explanation for the photocurrent values shown in Figure 6.9. For
example, doubling the intensity of radiation translates to doubling the number of photons that strike the
surface per unit time. The larger the number of photons, the larger is the number of photoelectrons, which
leads to a larger photocurrent in the circuit. This is how radiation intensity affects the photocurrent. The
photocurrent must reach a plateau at some value of potential difference because, in unit time, the number of
photoelectrons is equal to the number of incident photons and the number of incident photons does not
depend on the applied potential difference at all, but only on the intensity of incident radiation. The stopping
potential does not change with the radiation intensity because the kinetic energy of photoelectrons (see
Equation 6.14) does not depend on the radiation intensity.

Two of Einstein's influential ideas introduced in 1905 were the theory of special relativity and the concept of a

light quantum, which we now call a photon. Beyond 1905, Einstein went further to suggest that freely

propagating electromagnetic waves consisted of photons that are particles of light in the same sense that

electrons or other massive particles are particles of matter. A beam of monochromatic light of wavelength (or

equivalently, of frequency f) can be seen either as a classical wave or as a collection of photons that travel in a

vacuum with one speed, c (the speed of light), and all carrying the same energy,  This idea proved

useful for explaining the interactions of light with particles of matter.

Momentum of a Photon

Unlike a particle of matter that is characterized by its rest mass a photon is massless. In a vacuum, unlike a
particle of matter that may vary its speed but cannot reach the speed of light, a photon travels at only one
speed, which is exactly the speed of light. From the point of view of Newtonian classical mechanics, these two
characteristics imply that a photon should not exist at all. For example, how can we find the linear momentum
or kinetic energy of a body whose mass is zero? This apparent paradox vanishes if we describe a photon as a
relativistic particle. According to the theory of special relativity, any particle in nature obeys the relativistic
energy equation

                                                                                                           6.17

This relation can also be applied to a photon. In Equation 6.17, E is the total energy of a particle, p is its linear

momentum, and is its rest mass. For a photon, we simply set                in this equation. This leads to the

expression for the momentum of a photon

                                                                                                           6.18

Here the photon's energy is the same as that of a light quantum of frequency f, which we introduced to
explain the photoelectric effect:

                                                                                                           6.19

The wave relation that connects frequency f with wavelength and speed c also holds for photons:

                                                                                                                                                     6.20

Therefore, a photon can be equivalently characterized by either its energy and wavelength, or its frequency
and momentum. Equation 6.19 and Equation 6.20 can be combined into the explicit relation between a
photon's momentum and its wavelength:

                                                                                                           6.21

Notice that this equation gives us only the magnitude of the photon's momentum and contains no information
about the direction in which the photon is moving. To include the direction, it is customary to write the
photon's momentum as a vector:

                                                                                                           6.22

In Equation 6.22,   is the reduced Planck's constant (pronounced "h-bar"), which is just Planck's

constant divided by the factor Vector is called the "wave vector" or propagation vector (the direction in
which a photon is moving). The propagation vector shows the direction of the photon's linear momentum

vector. The magnitude of the wave vector is    and is called the wave number. Notice that this
256  6 · Photons and Matter Waves

     equation does not introduce any new physics. We can verify that the magnitude of the vector in Equation 6.22
     is the same as that given by Equation 6.18.

     The Compton Effect

     The Compton effect is the term used for an unusual result observed when X-rays are scattered on some
     materials. By classical theory, when an electromagnetic wave is scattered off atoms, the wavelength of the
     scattered radiation is expected to be the same as the wavelength of the incident radiation. Contrary to this
     prediction of classical physics, observations show that when X-rays are scattered off some materials, such as
     graphite, the scattered X-rays have different wavelengths from the wavelength of the incident X-rays. This
     classically unexplainable phenomenon was studied experimentally by Arthur H. Compton and his
     collaborators, and Compton gave its explanation in 1923.

     To explain the shift in wavelengths measured in the experiment, Compton used Einstein's idea of light as a
     particle. The Compton effect has a very important place in the history of physics because it shows that
     electromagnetic radiation cannot be explained as a purely wave phenomenon. The explanation of the Compton
     effect gave a convincing argument to the physics community that electromagnetic waves can indeed behave
     like a stream of photons, which placed the concept of a photon on firm ground.

     The schematics of Compton's experimental setup are shown in Figure 6.11. The idea of the experiment is

     straightforward: Monochromatic X-rays with wavelength are incident on a sample of graphite (the "target"),

     where they interact with atoms inside the sample; they later emerge as scattered X-rays with wavelength A

     detector placed behind the target can measure the intensity of radiation scattered in any direction with

     respect to the direction of the incident X-ray beam. This scattering angle, is the angle between the direction

     of the scattered beam and the direction of the incident beam. In this experiment, we know the intensity and

     the wavelength of the incoming (incident) beam; and for a given scattering angle we measure the intensity

     and the wavelength of the outgoing (scattered) beam. Typical results of these measurements are shown in

     Figure 6.12, where the x-axis is the wavelength of the scattered X-rays and the y-axis is the intensity of the

     scattered X-rays, measured for different scattering angles (indicated on the graphs). For all scattering angles

     (except for  we measure two intensity peaks. One peak is located at the wavelength which is the

     wavelength of the incident beam. The other peak is located at some other wavelength, The two peaks are

     separated by which depends on the scattering angle of the outgoing beam (in the direction of

     observation). The separation is called the Compton shift.

Figure 6.12 Experimental data show the Compton effect for X-rays scattering off graphite at various angles: The intensity of the scattered
beam has two peaks. One peak appears at the wavelength of the incident radiation and the second peak appears at wavelength The
separation between the peaks depends on the scattering angle which is the angular position of the detector in Figure 6.11. The
experimental data in this figure are plotted in arbitrary units so that the height of the profile reflects the intensity of the scattered beam
above background noise.

Compton Shift

As given by Compton, the explanation of the Compton shift is that in the target material, graphite, valence
electrons are loosely bound in the atoms and behave like free electrons. Compton assumed that the incident X-
ray radiation is a stream of photons. An incoming photon in this stream collides with a valence electron in the
graphite target. In the course of this collision, the incoming photon transfers some part of its energy and
momentum to the target electron and leaves the scene as a scattered photon. This model explains in
qualitative terms why the scattered radiation has a longer wavelength than the incident radiation. Put simply, a
photon that has lost some of its energy emerges as a photon with a lower frequency, or equivalently, with a
longer wavelength. To show that his model was correct, Compton used it to derive the expression for the
Compton shift. In his derivation, he assumed that both photon and electron are relativistic particles and that
the collision obeys two commonsense principles: (1) the conservation of linear momentum and (2) the
conservation of total relativistic energy.

In the following derivation of the Compton shift, and denote the energy and momentum, respectively,

of an incident photon with frequency f. The photon collides with a relativistic electron at rest, which means

that immediately before the collision, the electron's energy is entirely its rest mass energy,  Immediately

after the collision, the electron has energy E and momentum both of which satisfy Equation 6.19.

Immediately after the collision, the outgoing photon has energy  momentum  and frequency The

direction of the incident photon is horizontal from left to right, and the direction of the outgoing photon is at
the angle as illustrated in Figure 6.11. The scattering angle is the angle between the momentum vectors

and  and we can write their scalar product:

                                                                                                  6.23

Following Compton's argument, we assume that the colliding photon and electron form an isolated system.
This assumption is valid for weakly bound electrons that, to a good approximation, can be treated as free
particles. Our first equation is the conservation of energy for the photon-electron system:

                                                                                                                                                     6.24

The left side of this equation is the energy of the system at the instant immediately before the collision, and the
right side of the equation is the energy of the system at the instant immediately after the collision. Our second
equation is the conservation of linear momentum for the photon-electron system where the electron is at rest
at the instant immediately before the collision:

                                                                                                  6.25
258  6 · Photons and Matter Waves

     The left side of this equation is the momentum of the system right before the collision, and the right side of the
     equation is the momentum of the system right after collision. The entire physics of Compton scattering is
     contained in these three preceding equations--the remaining part is algebra. At this point, we could jump to
     the concluding formula for the Compton shift, but it is beneficial to highlight the main algebraic steps that lead
     to Compton's formula, which we give here as follows.

     We start with rearranging the terms in Equation 6.24 and squaring it:

     In the next step, we substitute Equation 6.19 for simplify, and divide both sides by to obtain

     Now we can use Equation 6.21 to express this form of the energy equation in terms of momenta. The result is
                                                                                                                                                          6.26

     To eliminate we turn to the momentum equation Equation 6.25, rearrange its terms, and square it to obtain

     The product of the momentum vectors is given by Equation 6.23. When we substitute this result for in
     Equation 6.26, we obtain the energy equation that contains the scattering angle

     With further algebra, this result can be simplified to

                                                                                                           6.27

     Now recall Equation 6.21 and write:  and                      When these relations are substituted into

     Equation 6.27, we obtain the relation for the Compton shift:

                                                                                                           6.28

     The factor  is called the Compton wavelength of the electron:

                                                                                                           6.29

     Denoting the shift as             the concluding result can be rewritten as

                                                                                                           6.30

     This formula for the Compton shift describes outstandingly well the experimental results shown in Figure
     6.12. Scattering data measured for molybdenum, graphite, calcite, and many other target materials are in
     accord with this theoretical result. The nonshifted peak shown in Figure 6.12 is due to photon collisions with
     tightly bound inner electrons in the target material. Photons that collide with the inner electrons of the target
     atoms in fact collide with the entire atom. In this extreme case, the rest mass in Equation 6.29 must be
     changed to the rest mass of the atom. This type of shift is four orders of magnitude smaller than the shift
     caused by collisions with electrons and is so small that it can be neglected.

     Compton scattering is an example of inelastic scattering, in which the scattered radiation has a longer
     wavelength than the wavelength of the incident radiation. In today's usage, the term "Compton scattering" is
     used for the inelastic scattering of photons by free, charged particles. In Compton scattering, treating photons
     as particles with momenta that can be transferred to charged particles provides the theoretical background to

Strategy

To find the wavelength of the scattered X-ray, first we must find the Compton shift for the given scattering

angle,        We use Equation 6.30. Then we add this shift to the incident wavelength to obtain the scattered

wavelength. The largest Compton shift occurs at the angle when  has the largest value, which is for

This gives the scattered wavelength:

Significance
The largest shift in wavelength is detected for the backscattered radiation; however, most of the photons from
the incident beam pass through the target and only a small fraction of photons gets backscattered (typically,
less than 5%). Therefore, these measurements require highly sensitive detectors.

6.4 Bohr's Model of the Hydrogen Atom

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Explain the difference between the absorption spectrum and the emission spectrum of radiation emitted by
      atoms

 · Describe the Rutherford gold foil experiment and the discovery of the atomic nucleus
 · Explain the atomic structure of hydrogen
 · Describe the postulates of the early quantum theory for the hydrogen atom
 · Summarize how Bohr's quantum model of the hydrogen atom explains the radiation spectrum of atomic

      hydrogen

Historically, Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom is the very first model of atomic structure that correctly
explained the radiation spectra of atomic hydrogen. The model has a special place in the history of physics
because it introduced an early quantum theory, which brought about new developments in scientific thought
and later culminated in the development of quantum mechanics. To understand the specifics of Bohr's model,
we must first review the nineteenth-century discoveries that prompted its formulation.

When we use a prism to analyze white light coming from the sun, several dark lines in the solar spectrum are
260  6 · Photons and Matter Waves

     observed (Figure 6.13). Solar absorption lines are called Fraunhofer lines after Joseph von Fraunhofer, who
     accurately measured their wavelengths. During 1854-1861, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen discovered
     that for the various chemical elements, the line emission spectrum of an element exactly matches its line
     absorption spectrum. The difference between the absorption spectrum and the emission spectrum is
     explained in Figure 6.14. An absorption spectrum is observed when light passes through a gas. This spectrum
     appears as black lines that occur only at certain wavelengths on the background of the continuous spectrum of
     white light (Figure 6.13). The missing wavelengths tell us which wavelengths of the radiation are absorbed by
     the gas. The emission spectrum is observed when light is emitted by a gas. This spectrum is seen as colorful
     lines on the black background (see Figure 6.15 and Figure 6.16). Positions of the emission lines tell us which
     wavelengths of the radiation are emitted by the gas. Each chemical element has its own characteristic emission
     spectrum. For each element, the positions of its emission lines are exactly the same as the positions of its
     absorption lines. This means that atoms of a specific element absorb radiation only at specific wavelengths
     and radiation that does not have these wavelengths is not absorbed by the element at all. This also means that
     the radiation emitted by atoms of each element has exactly the same wavelengths as the radiation they absorb.

     Figure 6.13 In the solar emission spectrum in the visible range from 380 nm to 710 nm, Fraunhofer lines are observed as vertical black
     lines at specific spectral positions in the continuous spectrum. Highly sensitive modern instruments observe thousands of such lines.

     Figure 6.14 Observation of line spectra: (a) setup to observe absorption lines; (b) setup to observe emission lines. (a) White light passes
     through a cold gas that is contained in a glass flask. A prism is used to separate wavelengths of the passed light. In the spectrum of the
     passed light, some wavelengths are missing, which are seen as black absorption lines in the continuous spectrum on the viewing screen.
     (b) A gas is contained in a glass discharge tube that has electrodes at its ends. At a high potential difference between the electrodes, the
     gas glows and the light emitted from the gas passes through the prism that separates its wavelengths. In the spectrum of the emitted light,
     only specific wavelengths are present, which are seen as colorful emission lines on the screen.

Emission spectra of the elements have complex structures; they become even more complex for elements with
higher atomic numbers. The simplest spectrum, shown in Figure 6.15, belongs to the hydrogen atom. Only
four lines are visible to the human eye. As you read from right to left in Figure 6.15, these lines are: red (656
nm), called the H- line; aqua (486 nm), blue (434 nm), and violet (410 nm). The lines with wavelengths shorter
than 400 nm appear in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum (Figure 6.15, far left) and are invisible to the human
eye. There are infinitely many invisible spectral lines in the series for hydrogen.

An empirical formula to describe the positions (wavelengths) of the hydrogen emission lines in this series
was discovered in 1885 by Johann Balmer. It is known as the Balmer formula:

                                                                                                      6.31

The constant                             is called the Rydberg constant for hydrogen. In Equation 6.31, the

positive integer n takes on values         for the four visible lines in this series. The series of emission

lines given by the Balmer formula is called the Balmer series for hydrogen. Other emission lines of hydrogen

that were discovered in the twentieth century are described by the Rydberg formula, which summarizes all of

the experimental data:

                                                                                                      6.32

When          the series of spectral lines is called the Lyman series. When  the series is called the

Balmer series, and in this case, the Rydberg formula coincides with the Balmer formula. When  the

series is called the Paschen series. When  the series is called the Brackett series. When             the

series is called the Pfund series. When    we have the Humphreys series. As you may guess, there are

infinitely many such spectral bands in the spectrum of hydrogen because can be any positive integer

number.

The Rydberg formula for hydrogen gives the exact positions of the spectral lines as they are observed in a
laboratory; however, at the beginning of the twentieth century, nobody could explain why it worked so well. The
Rydberg formula remained unexplained until the first successful model of the hydrogen atom was proposed in
1913.

     The key to unlocking the mystery of atomic spectra is in understanding atomic structure. Scientists have long
     known that matter is made of atoms. According to nineteenth-century science, atoms are the smallest
     indivisible quantities of matter. This scientific belief was shattered by a series of groundbreaking experiments
     that proved the existence of subatomic particles, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons.

     The electron was discovered and identified as the smallest quantity of electric charge by J.J. Thomson in 1897
     in his cathode ray experiments, also known as -ray experiments: A -ray is a beam of electrons. In 1904,
     Thomson proposed the first model of atomic structure, known as the "plum pudding" model, in which an atom
     consisted of an unknown positively charged matter with negative electrons embedded in it like plums in a
     pudding. Around 1900, E. Rutherford, and independently, Paul Ulrich Villard, classified all radiation known at
     that time as -rays, -rays, and -rays (a -ray is a beam of highly energetic photons). In 1907, Rutherford and
     Thomas Royds used spectroscopy methods to show that positively charged particles of -radiation (called

      -particles) are in fact doubly ionized atoms of helium. In 1909, Rutherford, Ernest Marsden, and Hans Geiger
     used -particles in their famous scattering experiment that disproved Thomson's model (see Linear
     Momentum and Collisions).

     In the Rutherford gold foil experiment (also known as the Geiger-Marsden experiment), -particles were

     incident on a thin gold foil and were scattered by gold atoms inside the foil (see Types of Collisions). The

     outgoing particles were detected by a  scintillation screen surrounding the gold target (for a detailed

     description of the experimental setup, see Linear Momentum and Collisions). When a scattered particle struck

     the screen, a tiny flash of light (scintillation) was observed at that location. By counting the scintillations seen

     at various angles with respect to the direction of the incident beam, the scientists could determine what

     fraction of the incident particles were scattered and what fraction were not deflected at all. If the plum pudding

     model were correct, there would be no back-scattered -particles. However, the results of the Rutherford

     experiment showed that, although a sizable fraction of -particles emerged from the foil not scattered at all as

     though the foil were not in their way, a significant fraction of -particles were back-scattered toward the

     source. This kind of result was possible only when most of the mass and the entire positive charge of the gold

     atom were concentrated in a tiny space inside the atom.

     In 1911, Rutherford proposed a nuclear model of the atom. In Rutherford's model, an atom contained a
     positively charged nucleus of negligible size, almost like a point, but included almost the entire mass of the
     atom. The atom also contained negative electrons that were located within the atom but relatively far away
     from the nucleus. Ten years later, Rutherford coined the name proton for the nucleus of hydrogen and the
     name neutron for a hypothetical electrically neutral particle that would mediate the binding of positive
     protons in the nucleus (the neutron was discovered in 1932 by James Chadwick). Rutherford is credited with
     the discovery of the atomic nucleus; however, the Rutherford model of atomic structure does not explain the
     Rydberg formula for the hydrogen emission lines.

Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom, proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913, was the first quantum model that

correctly explained the hydrogen emission spectrum. Bohr's model combines the classical mechanics of

planetary motion with the quantum concept of photons. Once Rutherford had established the existence of the

atomic nucleus, Bohr's intuition that the negative electron in the hydrogen atom must revolve around the

positive nucleus became a logical consequence of the inverse-square-distance law of electrostatic attraction.

Recall that Coulomb's law describing the attraction between two opposite charges has a similar form to

Newton's universal law of gravitation in the sense that the gravitational force and the electrostatic force are

both decreasing as  where r is the separation distance between the bodies. In the same way as Earth

revolves around the sun, the negative electron in the hydrogen atom can revolve around the positive nucleus.

However, an accelerating charge radiates its energy. Classically, if the electron moved around the nucleus in a

planetary fashion, it would be undergoing centripetal acceleration, and thus would be radiating energy that

would cause it to spiral down into the nucleus. Such a planetary hydrogen atom would not be stable, which is

contrary to what we know about ordinary hydrogen atoms that do not disintegrate. Moreover, the classical

motion of the electron is not able to explain the discrete emission spectrum of hydrogen.

To circumvent these two difficulties, Bohr proposed the following three postulates of Bohr's model:

1. The negative electron moves around the positive nucleus (proton) in a circular orbit. All electron orbits are
     centered at the nucleus. Not all classically possible orbits are available to an electron bound to the nucleus.

2. The allowed electron orbits satisfy the first quantization condition: In the nth orbit, the angular
     momentum of the electron can take only discrete values:

                                                                                                          6.33

This postulate says that the electron's angular momentum is quantized. Denoted by and

respectively, the radius of the nth orbit and the electron's speed in it, the first quantization condition can

be expressed explicitly as                                                                                6.34

                                                                

3. An electron is allowed to make transitions from one orbit where its energy is to another orbit where its
     energy is When an atom absorbs a photon, the electron makes a transition to a higher-energy orbit.
     When an atom emits a photon, the electron transits to a lower-energy orbit. Electron transitions with the
     simultaneous photon absorption or photon emission take place instantaneously. The allowed electron
     transitions satisfy the second quantization condition:

                                                                                                                                                    6.35

     where is the energy of either an emitted or an absorbed photon with frequency f. The second
      quantization condition states that an electron's change in energy in the hydrogen atom is quantized.

These three postulates of the early quantum theory of the hydrogen atom allow us to derive not only the
Rydberg formula, but also the value of the Rydberg constant and other important properties of the hydrogen
atom such as its energy levels, its ionization energy, and the sizes of electron orbits. Note that in Bohr's model,
along with two nonclassical quantization postulates, we also have the classical description of the electron as a
particle that is subjected to the Coulomb force, and its motion must obey Newton's laws of motion. The
hydrogen atom, as an isolated system, must obey the laws of conservation of energy and momentum in the way
we know from classical physics. Having this theoretical framework in mind, we are ready to proceed with our
analysis.

Electron Orbits

To obtain the size of the electron's nth orbit and the electron's speed in it, we turn to Newtonian
mechanics. As a charged particle, the electron experiences an electrostatic pull toward the positively charged
nucleus in the center of its circular orbit. This electrostatic pull is the centripetal force that causes the electron
264  6 · Photons and Matter Waves

     to move in a circle around the nucleus. Therefore, the magnitude of centripetal force is identified with the
     magnitude of the electrostatic force:

                                                                                                                      6.36

     Here, denotes the value of the elementary charge. The negative electron and positive proton have the same

     value of charge,         When Equation 6.36 is combined with the first quantization condition given by

     Equation 6.34, we can solve for the speed, and for the radius,

                                                                                                                    6.38

     Note that these results tell us that the electron's speed as well as the radius of its orbit depend only on the

     index n that enumerates the orbit because all other quantities in the preceding equations are fundamental

     constants. We see from Equation 6.38 that the size of the orbit grows as the square of n. This means that the

     second orbit is four times as large as the first orbit, and the third orbit is nine times as large as the first orbit,

     and so on. We also see from Equation 6.37 that the electron's speed in the orbit decreases as the orbit size

     increases. The electron's speed is largest in the first Bohr orbit, for  which is the orbit closest to the

     nucleus. The radius of the first Bohr orbit is called the Bohr radius of hydrogen, denoted as Its value is

     obtained by setting      in Equation 6.38:

                                                 

                                                                                                                                       6.39

     We can substitute in Equation 6.38 to express the radius of the nth orbit in terms of

                                                                                                                      6.40

     This result means that the electron orbits in hydrogen atom are quantized because the orbital radius takes on

     only specific values of                     given by Equation 6.40, and no other values are allowed.

     Electron Energies

     The total energy     of an electron in the nth orbit is the sum of its kinetic energy  and its electrostatic
     potential energy      Utilizing Equation 6.37, we find that

                                                                           6.41

     Recall that the electrostatic potential energy of interaction between two charges and that are separated

     by a distance is                  Here,     is the charge of the nucleus in the hydrogen atom (the

     charge of the proton),            is the charge of the electron and      is the radius of the nth orbit. Now we

     use Equation 6.38 to find the potential energy of the electron:

                                                                                                                      6.42

     The total energy of the electron is the sum of Equation 6.41 and Equation 6.42:

                                                                           6.43

Note that the energy depends only on the index n because the remaining symbols in Equation 6.43 are
physical constants. The value of the constant factor in Equation 6.43 is

                                                                                                                      6.44

It is convenient to express the electron's energy in the nth orbit in terms of this energy, as

                                                                                                                      6.45

Now we can see that the electron energies in the hydrogen atom are quantized because they can have only

discrete values of                 given by Equation 6.45, and no other energy values are

allowed. This set of allowed electron energies is called the energy spectrum of hydrogen (Figure 6.17). The

index n that enumerates energy levels in Bohr's model is called the energy quantum number. We identify the

energy of the electron inside the hydrogen atom with the energy of the hydrogen atom. Note that the smallest

value of energy is obtained for  so the hydrogen atom cannot have energy smaller than that. This

smallest value of the electron energy in the hydrogen atom is called the ground state energy of the hydrogen

atom and its value is

                                                                                                                      6.46

The hydrogen atom may have other energies that are higher than the ground state. These higher energy states
are known as excited energy states of a hydrogen atom.

There is only one ground state, but there are infinitely many excited states because there are infinitely many

values of n in Equation 6.45. We say that the electron is in the "first exited state" when its energy is (when

), the second excited state when its energy is (when  ) and, in general, in the nth exited state

when its energy is     There is no highest-of-all excited state; however, there is a limit to the sequence of

excited states. If we keep increasing n in Equation 6.45, we find that the limit is                                   In this limit,
                                                                                                                    

the electron is no longer bound to the nucleus but becomes a free electron. An electron remains bound in the
hydrogen atom as long as its energy is negative. An electron that orbits the nucleus in the first Bohr orbit,
closest to the nucleus, is in the ground state, where its energy has the smallest value. In the ground state, the
electron is most strongly bound to the nucleus and its energy is given by Equation 6.46. If we want to remove
this electron from the atom, we must supply it with enough energy,  to at least balance out its ground state

energy

                                                                                                                      6.47

The energy that is needed to remove the electron from the atom is called the ionization energy. The ionization
energy  that is needed to remove the electron from the first Bohr orbit is called the ionization limit of the

hydrogen atom. The ionization limit in Equation 6.47 that we obtain in Bohr's model agrees with experimental
value.

     Spectral Emission Lines of Hydrogen

     To obtain the wavelengths of the emitted radiation when an electron makes a transition from the nth orbit to

     the mth orbit, we use the second of Bohr's quantization conditions and Equation 6.45 for energies. The

     emission of energy from the atom can occur only when an electron makes a transition from an excited state to

     a lower-energy state. In the course of such a transition, the emitted photon carries away the difference of

     energies between the states involved in the transition. The transition cannot go in the other direction because

     the energy of a photon cannot be negative, which means that for emission we must have  and

     Therefore, the third of Bohr's postulates gives

                                                                                                                  6.48

This value is exactly the Rydberg constant in the Rydberg heuristic formula Equation 6.32. In fact,

Equation 6.49 is identical to the Rydberg formula, because for a given m, we have                     In this

way, the Bohr quantum model of the hydrogen atom allows us to derive the experimental Rydberg constant

from first principles and to express it in terms of fundamental constants. Transitions between the allowed

electron orbits are illustrated in Figure 6.17.

We can repeat the same steps that led to Equation 6.49 to obtain the wavelength of the absorbed radiation; this
again gives Equation 6.49 but this time for the positions of absorption lines in the absorption spectrum of
hydrogen. The only difference is that for absorption, the quantum number m is the index of the orbit occupied
by the electron before the transition (lower-energy orbit) and the quantum number n is the index of the orbit to
which the electron makes the transition (higher-energy orbit). The difference between the electron energies in
these two orbits is the energy of the absorbed photon.

   EXAMPLE 6.10

Size and Ionization Energy of the Hydrogen Atom in an Excited State

If a hydrogen atom in the ground state absorbs a 93.7-nm photon, corresponding to a transition line in the
Lyman series, how does this affect the atom's energy and size? How much energy is needed to ionize the atom
when it is in this excited state? Give your answers in absolute units, and relative to the ground state.

Strategy

Before the absorption, the atom is in its ground state. This means that the electron transition takes place from

the orbit   to some higher nth orbit. First, we must determine for the absorbed wavelength

Then, we can use Equation 6.45 to find the energy of the excited state and its ionization energy  and

use Equation 6.40 to find the radius of the atom in the excited state. To estimate n, we use Equation 6.49.

Solution

Substitute         and            in Equation 6.49 and solve for You should not expect to obtain a perfect

integer answer because of rounding errors, but your answer will be close to an integer, and you can estimate n

Thus, after absorbing the 93.7-nm photon, the size of the hydrogen atom in the excited  state is 36 times

larger than before the absorption, when the atom was in the ground state. The energy of the fifth excited state

After absorbing the 93.7-nm photon, the energy of the hydrogen atom is larger than it was before the

     about its orbital speed and kinetic energy? What is the magnitude of its orbital angular momentum?

     Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom also correctly predicts the spectra of some hydrogen-like ions. Hydrogen-

     like ions are atoms of elements with an atomic number Z larger than one (  for hydrogen) but with all

     where is the ionization limit of a hydrogen atom. These equations are good approximations as long as the
     atomic number Z is not too large.

     The Bohr model is important because it was the first model to postulate the quantization of electron orbits in
     atoms. Thus, it represents an early quantum theory that gave a start to developing modern quantum theory. It
     introduced the concept of a quantum number to describe atomic states. The limitation of the early quantum
     theory is that it cannot describe atoms in which the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is larger than
     one. The Bohr model of hydrogen is a semi-classical model because it combines the classical concept of
     electron orbits with the new concept of quantization. The remarkable success of this model prompted many
     physicists to seek an explanation for why such a model should work at all, and to seek an understanding of the
     physics behind the postulates of early quantum theory. This search brought about the onset of an entirely new
     concept of "matter waves."

     other particles of matter can behave like waves. Today, this idea is known as de Broglie's hypothesis of matter

mechanics has paved the way for new engineering inventions and technologies, such as the laser and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). These new technologies drive discoveries in other sciences such as biology and
chemistry.

According to de Broglie's hypothesis, massless photons as well as massive particles must satisfy one common
set of relations that connect the energy E with the frequency f, and the linear momentum p with the
wavelength We have discussed these relations for photons in the context of Compton's effect. We are
recalling them now in a more general context. Any particle that has energy and momentum is a de Broglie
wave of frequency f and wavelength

Here, E and p are, respectively, the relativistic energy and the momentum of a particle. De Broglie's relations

are usually expressed in terms of the wave vector           and the wave frequency            as we usually
do for waves:

                                                                                                6.55

Wave theory tells us that a wave carries its energy with the group velocity. For matter waves, this group
velocity is the velocity u of the particle. Identifying the energy E and momentum p of a particle with its
relativistic energy and its relativistic momentum mu, respectively, it follows from de Broglie relations that
matter waves satisfy the following relation:

We use Equation 6.57 to find the de Broglie wavelength. When the problem involves a nonrelativistic object

moving with a nonrelativistic speed u, such as in (a) when        we use nonrelativistic momentum p.

When the nonrelativistic approximation cannot be used, such as in (c), we must use the relativistic momentum

                     where the rest mass energy of a particle is  and is the Lorentz factor

          The total energy E of a particle is given by Equation 6.53 and the kinetic energy is

     formula. However, it is simpler here to use Equation 6.58:

     If we use nonrelativistic momentum, we obtain the same result because 1 eV is much smaller than the rest

     mass of the electron.

     c. For a fast electron with                relativistic effects cannot be neglected because its total energy is

     We see from these estimates that De Broglie's wavelengths of macroscopic objects such as a ball are

     What is de Broglie's wavelength of a nonrelativistic proton with a kinetic energy of 1.0 eV?

     Using the concept of the electron matter wave, de Broglie provided a rationale for the quantization of the

     electron's angular momentum in the hydrogen atom, which was postulated in Bohr's quantum theory. The

     physical explanation for the first Bohr quantization condition comes naturally when we assume that an

     electron in a hydrogen atom behaves not like a particle but like a wave. To see it clearly, imagine a stretched

     guitar string that is clamped at both ends and vibrates in one of its normal modes. If the length of the string is l

     (Figure 6.18), the wavelengths of these vibrations cannot be arbitrary but must be such that an integer k

     number of half-wavelengths fit exactly on the distance l between the ends. This is the condition

     for a standing wave on a string. Now suppose that instead of having the string clamped at the walls, we bend its

     length into a circle and fasten its ends to each other. This produces a circular string that vibrates in normal

     modes, satisfying the same standing-wave condition, but the number of half-wavelengths must now be an even

     number       and the length l is now connected to the radius of the circle. This means that the radii are

     not arbitrary but must satisfy the following standing-wave condition:

                                                                                                                 6.59

Find the de Broglie wavelength of an electron in the third excited state of hydrogen.

Experimental confirmation of matter waves came in 1927 when C. Davisson and L. Germer performed a series
of electron-scattering experiments that clearly showed that electrons do behave like waves. Davisson and
Germer did not set up their experiment to confirm de Broglie's hypothesis: The confirmation came as a
byproduct of their routine experimental studies of metal surfaces under electron bombardment.

In the particular experiment that provided the very first evidence of electron waves (known today as the
Davisson-Germer experiment), they studied a surface of nickel. Their nickel sample was specially prepared
272  6 · Photons and Matter Waves

     in a high-temperature oven to change its usual polycrystalline structure to a form in which large single-crystal
     domains occupy the volume. Figure 6.19 shows the experimental setup. Thermal electrons are released from a
     heated element (usually made of tungsten) in the electron gun and accelerated through a potential difference

           becoming a well-collimated beam of electrons produced by an electron gun. The kinetic energy K of the
     electrons is adjusted by selecting a value of the potential difference in the electron gun. This produces a beam
     of electrons with a set value of linear momentum, in accordance with the conservation of energy:

                                                                                                                 6.61

     The electron beam is incident on the nickel sample in the direction normal to its surface. At the surface, it

     scatters in various directions. The intensity of the beam scattered in a selected direction is measured by a

     highly sensitive detector. The detector's angular position with respect to the direction of the incident beam can

     be varied from       to               The entire setup is enclosed in a vacuum chamber to prevent electron

     collisions with air molecules, as such thermal collisions would change the electrons' kinetic energy and are not

     desirable.

     Figure 6.19 Schematics of the experimental setup of the Davisson-Germer diffraction experiment. A well-collimated beam of electrons is
     scattered off the nickel target. The kinetic energy of electrons in the incident beam is selected by adjusting a variable potential, in the
     electron gun. Intensity of the scattered electron beam is measured for a range of scattering angles whereas the distance between the
     detector and the target does not change.

     When the nickel target has a polycrystalline form with many randomly oriented microscopic crystals, the
     incident electrons scatter off its surface in various random directions. As a result, the intensity of the scattered
     electron beam is much the same in any direction, resembling a diffuse reflection of light from a porous
     surface. However, when the nickel target has a regular crystalline structure, the intensity of the scattered
     electron beam shows a clear maximum at a specific angle and the results show a clear diffraction pattern (see
     Figure 6.20). Similar diffraction patterns formed by X-rays scattered by various crystalline solids were studied
     in 1912 by father-and-son physicists William H. Bragg and William L. Bragg. The Bragg law in X-ray
     crystallography provides a connection between the wavelength of the radiation incident on a crystalline
     lattice, the lattice spacing, and the position of the interference maximum in the diffracted radiation (see
     Diffraction).

     The lattice spacing of the Davisson-Germer target, determined with X-ray crystallography, was measured to be

                  Unlike X-ray crystallography in which X-rays penetrate the sample, in the original

     Davisson-Germer experiment, only the surface atoms interact with the incident electron beam. For the

     surface diffraction, the maximum intensity of the reflected electron beam is observed for scattering angles

     that satisfy the condition            (see Figure 6.21). The first-order maximum (for  ) is measured at a

     scattering angle of               at  which gives the wavelength of the incident radiation as

Diffraction lines measured with low-energy electrons, such as those used in the Davisson-Germer experiment,
are quite broad (see Figure 6.20) because the incident electrons are scattered only from the surface. The
resolution of diffraction images greatly improves when a higher-energy electron beam passes through a thin
metal foil. This occurs because the diffraction image is created by scattering off many crystalline planes inside
the volume, and the maxima produced in scattering at Bragg angles are sharp (see Figure 6.22).

     Since the work of Davisson and Germer, de Broglie's hypothesis has been extensively tested with various
     experimental techniques, and the existence of de Broglie waves has been confirmed for numerous elementary
     particles. Neutrons have been used in scattering experiments to determine crystalline structures of solids
     from interference patterns formed by neutron matter waves. The neutron has zero charge and its mass is
     comparable with the mass of a positively charged proton. Both neutrons and protons can be seen as matter
     waves. Therefore, the property of being a matter wave is not specific to electrically charged particles but is true
     of all particles in motion. Matter waves of molecules as large as carbon have been measured. All physical
     objects, small or large, have an associated matter wave as long as they remain in motion. The universal
     character of de Broglie matter waves is firmly established.

     Neutron Scattering

     Suppose that a neutron beam is used in a diffraction experiment on a typical crystalline solid. Estimate the
     kinetic energy of a neutron (in eV) in the neutron beam and compare it with kinetic energy of an ideal gas in
     equilibrium at room temperature.

     Strategy

     We assume that a typical crystal spacing a is of the order of 1.0 Å. To observe a diffraction pattern on such a

     lattice, the neutron wavelength must be on the same order of magnitude as the lattice spacing. We use

     Equation 6.61 to find the momentum p and kinetic energy K. To compare this energy with the energy of

     ideal gas in equilibrium at room temperature  we use the relation                     where

                  is the Boltzmann constant.

6.6 Wave-Particle Duality

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Identify phenomena in which electromagnetic waves behave like a beam of photons and particles behave
      like waves

 · Describe the physics principles behind electron microscopy
 · Summarize the evolution of scientific thought that led to the development of quantum mechanics

The energy of radiation detected by a radio-signal receiving antenna comes as the energy of an
electromagnetic wave. The same energy of radiation detected by a photocurrent in the photoelectric effect
comes as the energy of individual photon particles. Therefore, the question arises about the nature of
electromagnetic radiation: Is a photon a wave or is it a particle? Similar questions may be asked about other
276  6 · Photons and Matter Waves

     known forms of energy. For example, an electron that forms part of an electric current in a circuit behaves like
     a particle moving in unison with other electrons inside the conductor. The same electron behaves as a wave
     when it passes through a solid crystalline structure and forms a diffraction image. Is an electron a wave or is it
     a particle? The same question can be extended to all particles of matter--elementary particles, as well as
     compound molecules--asking about their true physical nature. At our present state of knowledge, such
     questions about the true nature of things do not have conclusive answers. All we can say is that wave-particle
     duality exists in nature: Under some experimental conditions, a particle appears to act as a particle, and
     under different experimental conditions, a particle appears to act a wave. Conversely, under some physical
     circumstances electromagnetic radiation acts as a wave, and under other physical circumstances, radiation
     acts as a beam of photons.

     This dualistic interpretation is not a new physics concept brought about by specific discoveries in the
     twentieth century. It was already present in a debate between Isaac Newton and Christiaan Huygens about the
     nature of light, beginning in the year 1670. According to Newton, a beam of light is a collection of corpuscles of
     light. According to Huygens, light is a wave. The corpuscular hypothesis failed in 1803, when Thomas Young
     announced his double-slit interference experiment with light (see Figure 6.23), which firmly established
     light as a wave. In James Clerk Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism (completed by the year 1873), light is an
     electromagnetic wave. Maxwell's classical view of radiation as an electromagnetic wave is still valid today;
     however, it is unable to explain blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect, where light acts as a beam of
     photons.

     Figure 6.23 Young's double-slit experiment explains the interference of light by making an analogy with the interference of water waves.
     Two waves are generated at the positions of two slits in an opaque screen. The waves have the same wavelengths. They travel from their
     origins at the slits to the viewing screen placed to the right of the slits. The waves meet on the viewing screen. At the positions marked
     "Max" on the screen, the meeting waves are in-phase and the combined wave amplitude is enhanced. At positions marked "Min," the
     combined wave amplitude is zero. For light, this mechanism creates a bright-and-dark fringe pattern on the viewing screen.

     A similar dichotomy existed in the interpretation of electricity. From Benjamin Franklin's observations of
     electricity in 1751 until J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron in 1897, electric current was seen as a flow in
     a continuous electric medium. Within this theory of electric fluid, the present theory of electric circuits was
     developed, and electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction were discovered. Thomson's experiment
     showed that the unit of negative electric charge (an electron) can travel in a vacuum without any medium to
     carry the charge around, as in electric circuits. This discovery changed the way in which electricity is
     understood today and gave the electron its particle status. In Bohr's early quantum theory of the hydrogen
     atom, both the electron and the proton are particles of matter. Likewise, in the Compton scattering of X-rays on

electrons, the electron is a particle. On the other hand, in electron-scattering experiments on crystalline
structures, the electron behaves as a wave.

A skeptic may raise a question that perhaps an electron might always be nothing more than a particle, and that
the diffraction images obtained in electron-scattering experiments might be explained within some
macroscopic model of a crystal and a macroscopic model of electrons coming at it like a rain of ping-pong
balls. As a matter of fact, to investigate this question, we do not need a complex model of a crystal but just a
couple of simple slits in a screen that is opaque to electrons. In other words, to gather convincing evidence
about the nature of an electron, we need to repeat the Young double-slit experiment with electrons. If the
electron is a wave, we should observe the formation of interference patterns typical for waves, such as those
described in Figure 6.23, even when electrons come through the slits one by one. However, if the electron is a
not a wave but a particle, the interference fringes will not be formed.

The very first double-slit experiment with a beam of electrons, performed by Claus Jönsson in Germany in
1961, demonstrated that a beam of electrons indeed forms an interference pattern, which means that
electrons collectively behave as a wave. The first double-slit experiments with single electrons passing through
the slits one-by-one were performed by Giulio Pozzi in 1974 in Italy and by Akira Tonomura in 1989 in Japan.
They show that interference fringes are formed gradually, even when electrons pass through the slits
individually. This demonstrates conclusively that electron-diffraction images are formed because of the wave
nature of electrons. The results seen in double-slit experiments with electrons are illustrated by the images of
the interference pattern in Figure 6.24.

Figure 6.24 Computer-simulated interference fringes seen in the Young double-slit experiment with electrons. One pattern is gradually
formed on the screen, regardless of whether the electrons come through the slits as a beam or individually one-by-one.

EXAMPLE 6.15

Double-Slit Experiment with Electrons

In one experimental setup for studying interference patterns of electron waves, two slits are created in a gold-

coated silicon membrane. Each slit is 62-nm wide and  long, and the separation between the slits is 272

nm. The electron beam is created in an electron gun by heating a tungsten element and by accelerating the

electrons across a 600-V potential. The beam is subsequently collimated using electromagnetic lenses, and the

collimated beam of electrons is sent through the slits. Find the angular position of the first-order bright fringe

on the viewing screen.

Strategy

Recall that the angular position of the nth order bright fringe that is formed in Young's two-slit interference

pattern (discussed in a previous chapter) is related to the separation, d, between the slits and to the

wavelength, of the incident light by the equation     where                         The separation is

given and is equal to         For the first-order fringe, we take      The only thing we now need is the

wavelength of the incident electron wave.

smaller than its rest energy

     The wave-particle dual nature of matter particles and of radiation is a declaration of our inability to describe
     physical reality within one unified classical theory because separately neither a classical particle approach nor
     a classical wave approach can fully explain the observed phenomena. This limitation of the classical approach
     was realized by the year 1928, and a foundation for a new statistical theory, called quantum mechanics, was
     put in place by Bohr, Edwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, and Paul Dirac. Quantum mechanics takes de
     Broglie's idea of matter waves to be the fundamental property of all particles and gives it a statistical
     interpretation. According to this interpretation, a wave that is associated with a particle carries information
     about the probable positions of the particle and about its other properties. A single particle is seen as a moving
     wave packet such as the one shown in Figure 6.25. We can intuitively sense from this example that if a particle
     is a wave packet, we will not be able to measure its exact position in the same sense as we cannot pinpoint a
     location of a wave packet in a vibrating guitar string. The uncertainty, in measuring the particle's position
     is connected to the uncertainty, in the simultaneous measuring of its linear momentum by Heisenberg's
     uncertainty principle:

                                                                                                                6.63

     Heisenberg's principle expresses the law of nature that, at the quantum level, our perception is limited. For

     example, if we know the exact position of a body (which means that  in Equation 6.63) at the same time

     we cannot know its momentum, because then the uncertainty in its momentum becomes infinite (because

                in Equation 6.63). The Heisenberg uncertainty principle sets the limit on the precision of

     simultaneous measurements of position and momentum of a particle; it shows that the best precision we can
     obtain is when we have an equals sign ( ) in Equation 6.63, and we cannot do better than that, even with the
     best instruments of the future. Heisenberg's principle is a consequence of the wave nature of particles.

We routinely use many electronic devices that exploit wave-particle duality without even realizing the
sophistication of the physics underlying their operation. One example of a technology based on the particle
properties of photons and electrons is a charge-coupled device, which is used for light detection in any
instrumentation where high-quality digital data are required, such as in digital cameras or in medical sensors.
An example in which the wave properties of electrons is exploited is an electron microscope.

In 1931, physicist Ernst Ruska--building on the idea that magnetic fields can direct an electron beam just as
lenses can direct a beam of light in an optical microscope--developed the first prototype of the electron
microscope. This development originated the field of electron microscopy. In the transmission electron
microscope (TEM), shown in Figure 6.26, electrons are produced by a hot tungsten element and accelerated by
a potential difference in an electron gun, which gives them up to 400 keV in kinetic energy. After leaving the
electron gun, the electron beam is focused by electromagnetic lenses (a system of condensing lenses) and
transmitted through a specimen sample to be viewed. The image of the sample is reconstructed from the
transmitted electron beam. The magnified image may be viewed either directly on a fluorescent screen or
indirectly by sending it, for example, to a digital camera or a computer monitor. The entire setup consisting of
the electron gun, the lenses, the specimen, and the fluorescent screen are enclosed in a vacuum chamber to
prevent the energy loss from the beam. Resolution of the TEM is limited only by spherical aberration
(discussed in a previous chapter). Modern high-resolution models of a TEM can have resolving power greater
than 0.5 Å and magnifications higher than 50 million times. For comparison, the best resolving power
obtained with light microscopy is currently about 97 nm. A limitation of the TEM is that the samples must be
about 100-nm thick and biological samples require a special preparation involving chemical "fixing" to
stabilize them for ultrathin slicing.
280  6 · Photons and Matter Waves

     Figure 6.26 TEM: An electron beam produced by an electron gun is collimated by condenser lenses and passes through a specimen. The
     transmitted electrons are projected on a screen and the image is sent to a camera. (credit: modification of work by Dr. Graham Beards)

     Such limitations do not appear in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), which was invented by Manfred
     von Ardenne in 1937. In an SEM, a typical energy of the electron beam is up to 40 keV and the beam is not
     transmitted through a sample but is scattered off its surface. Surface topography of the sample is
     reconstructed by analyzing back-scattered electrons, transmitted electrons, and the emitted radiation
     produced by electrons interacting with atoms in the sample. The resolving power of an SEM is better than 1
     nm, and the magnification can be more than 250 times better than that obtained with a light microscope. The
     samples scanned by an SEM can be as large as several centimeters but they must be specially prepared,
     depending on electrical properties of the sample.

     High magnifications of the TEM and SEM allow us to see individual molecules. High resolving powers of the
     TEM and SEM allow us to see fine details, such as those shown in the SEM micrograph of pollen at the
     beginning of this chapter (Figure 6.1).

INTRODUCTION Quantum mechanics is a powerful framework for understanding the motions and
interactions of particles at small scales, such as atoms and molecules. The ideas behind quantum mechanics
often appear quite strange. In many ways, our everyday experience with the macroscopic physical world does
not prepare us for the microscopic world of quantum mechanics. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce
you to this exciting world.
Pictured above is a quantum-computer processor. This device is the "brain" of a quantum computer that
operates at near-absolute zero temperatures. Unlike a digital computer, which encodes information in binary
digits (definite states of either zero or one), a quantum computer encodes information in quantum bits or

     qubits (mixed states of zero and one). Quantum computers are discussed in the first section of this chapter.

     7.1 Wave Functions

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe the statistical interpretation of the wave function
      · Use the wave function to determine probabilities
      · Calculate expectation values of position, momentum, and kinetic energy

     In the preceding chapter, we saw that particles act in some cases like particles and in other cases like waves.

     But what does it mean for a particle to "act like a wave"? What precisely is "waving"? What rules govern how

     this wave changes and propagates? How is the wave function used to make predictions? For example, if the

     amplitude of an electron wave is given by a function of position and time,   , defined for all x, where

     exactly is the electron? The purpose of this chapter is to answer these questions.

     Using the Wave Function

     A clue to the physical meaning of the wave function  is provided by the two-slit interference of

     monochromatic light (Figure 7.2). (See also Electromagnetic Waves and Interference.) The wave function of a

     light wave is given by E(x,t), and its energy density is given by , where E is the electric field strength. The

     energy of an individual photon depends only on the frequency of light,              so  is proportional to

     the number of photons. When light waves from interfere with light waves from at the viewing screen (a
     distance D away), an interference pattern is produced (part (a) of the figure). Bright fringes correspond to
     points of constructive interference of the light waves, and dark fringes correspond to points of destructive
     interference of the light waves (part (b)).

     Suppose the screen is initially unexposed to light. If the screen is exposed to very weak light, the interference
     pattern appears gradually (Figure 7.2(c), left to right). Individual photon hits on the screen appear as dots. The
     dot density is expected to be large at locations where the interference pattern will be, ultimately, the most
     intense. In other words, the probability (per unit area) that a single photon will strike a particular spot on the

     screen is proportional to the square of the total electric field,  at that point. Under the right conditions, the

     same interference pattern develops for matter particles, such as electrons.

The square of the matter wave  in one dimension has a similar interpretation as the square of the electric

field . It gives the probability that a particle will be found at a particular position and time per unit length,

also called the probability density. The probability (P) a particle is found in a narrow interval (x, x + dx) at time
t is therefore

                               7.1

(Later, we define the magnitude squared for the general case of a function with "imaginary parts.") This
probabilistic interpretation of the wave function is called the Born interpretation. Examples of wave functions
and their squares for a particular time t are given in Figure 7.3.
298  7 · Quantum Mechanics

     Figure 7.3 Several examples of wave functions and the corresponding square of their wave functions.

     If the wave function varies slowly over the interval  , the probability a particle is found in the interval is
     approximately

                                                                                                                     7.2

     Notice that squaring the wave function ensures that the probability is positive. (This is analogous to squaring
     the electric field strength--which may be positive or negative--to obtain a positive value of intensity.) However,
     if the wave function does not vary slowly, we must integrate:

                                                                                                                     7.3

     This probability is just the area under the function       between x and  . The probability of finding
                                                                                                                7.4
     the particle "somewhere" (the normalization condition) is

                                                        

                                       

                                                      

     For a particle in two dimensions, the integration is over an area and requires a double integral; for a particle in
     three dimensions, the integration is over a volume and requires a triple integral. For now, we stick to the
     simple one-dimensional case.

time? (The answer is 50%, of course, but how do we get this answer by using the probabilistic interpretation of
the quantum mechanical wave function?)

Strategy
The first step is to write down the wave function. The ball is equally like to be found anywhere in the box, so
one way to describe the ball with a constant wave function (Figure 7.4). The normalization condition can be
used to find the value of the function and a simple integration over half of the box yields the final answer.

                Figure 7.4 Wave function for a ball in a tube of length L.

Solution

The wave function of the ball can be written as                      where C is a constant, and

otherwise. We can determine the constant C by applying the normalization condition (we set       to simplify

the notation):

                                                                   

                                                 

                                                                 

This integral can be broken into three parts: (1) negative infinity to zero, (2) zero to L, and (3) L to infinity. The

particle is constrained to be in the tube, so    outside the tube and the first and last integrations are zero.

The above equation can therefore be written

The value C does not depend on x and can be taken out of the integral, so we obtain

Integration gives                                                                    we have

300  7 · Quantum Mechanics

     Significance

     The probability of finding the ball in the first half of the tube is 50%, as expected. Two observations are

     noteworthy. First, this result corresponds to the area under the constant function from  to L/2 (the area of

     a square left of L/2). Second, this calculation requires an integration of the square of the wave function. A

     common mistake in performing such calculations is to forget to square the wave function before integration.

             EXAMPLE 7.2

     Where Is the Ball? (Part II)

     A ball is again constrained to move along a line inside a tube of length L. This time, the ball is found
     preferentially in the middle of the tube. One way to represent its wave function is with a simple cosine function
     (Figure 7.5). What is the probability of finding the ball in the last one-quarter of the tube?

                      Figure 7.5 Wave function for a ball in a tube of length L, where the ball is preferentially in the middle of the tube.

     Strategy
     We use the same strategy as before. In this case, the wave function has two unknown constants: One is
     associated with the wavelength of the wave and the other is the amplitude of the wave. We determine the
     amplitude by using the boundary conditions of the problem, and we evaluate the wavelength by using the
     normalization condition. Integration of the square of the wave function over the last quarter of the tube yields
     the final answer. The calculation is simplified by centering our coordinate system on the peak of the wave
     function.

     Solution
     The wave function of the ball can be written

     where A is the amplitude of the wave function and  is its wave number. Beyond this interval, the

     amplitude of the wave function is zero because the ball is confined to the tube. Requiring the wave function to

     terminate at the right end of the tube gives

This equation is satisfied if the argument of the cosine is an integral multiple of           and so on. In
this case, we have

or

Applying the normalization condition gives             , so the wave function of the ball is

To determine the probability of finding the ball in the last quarter of the tube, we square the function and
integrate:

Significance

The probability of finding the ball in the last quarter of the tube is 9.1%. The ball has a definite wavelength

    . If the tube is of macroscopic length             , the momentum of the ball is

This momentum is much too small to be measured by any human instrument.

An Interpretation of the Wave Function

We are now in position to begin to answer the questions posed at the beginning of this section. First, for a

traveling particle described by                        , what is "waving?" Based on the above discussion, the

answer is a mathematical function that can, among other things, be used to determine where the particle is

likely to be when a position measurement is performed. Second, how is the wave function used to make

predictions? If it is necessary to find the probability that a particle will be found in a certain interval, square

the wave function and integrate over the interval of interest. Soon, you will learn soon that the wave function

can be used to make many other kinds of predictions, as well.

Third, if a matter wave is given by the wave function  , where exactly is the particle? Two answers exist:

(1) when the observer is not looking (or the particle is not being otherwise detected), the particle is everywhere

         ; and (2) when the observer is looking (the particle is being detected), the particle "jumps into" a

particular position state        with a probability given by                                  --a process called

state reduction or wave function collapse. This answer is called the Copenhagen interpretation of the wave
function, or of quantum mechanics.

To illustrate this interpretation, consider the simple case of a particle that can occupy a small container either
at or (Figure 7.6). In classical physics, we assume the particle is located either at or when the
observer is not looking. However, in quantum mechanics, the particle may exist in a state of indefinite
position--that is, it may be located at and when the observer is not looking. The assumption that a
particle can only have one value of position (when the observer is not looking) is abandoned. Similar
comments can be made of other measurable quantities, such as momentum and energy.

     The bizarre consequences of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics are illustrated by a
     creative thought experiment first articulated by Erwin Schrödinger (National Geographic, 2013) (Figure 7.7):

     "A cat is placed in a steel box along with a Geiger counter, a vial of poison, a hammer, and a radioactive
     substance. When the radioactive substance decays, the Geiger detects it and triggers the hammer to release
     the poison, which subsequently kills the cat. The radioactive decay is a random [probabilistic] process, and
     there is no way to predict when it will happen. Physicists say the atom exists in a state known as a
     superposition--both decayed and not decayed at the same time. Until the box is opened, an observer doesn't
     know whether the cat is alive or dead--because the cat's fate is intrinsically tied to whether or not the atom has
     decayed and the cat would [according to the Copenhagen interpretation] be "living and dead ... in equal parts"
     until it is observed."

                                       Figure 7.7 Schrödinger's cat.

     Schrödinger took the absurd implications of this thought experiment (a cat simultaneously dead and alive) as
     an argument against the Copenhagen interpretation. However, this interpretation remains the most commonly
     taught view of quantum mechanics.

     Two-state systems (left and right, atom decays and does not decay, and so on) are often used to illustrate the

     principles of quantum mechanics. These systems find many applications in nature, including electron spin

     and mixed states of particles, atoms, and even molecules. Two-state systems are also finding application in the

     quantum computer, as mentioned in the introduction of this chapter. Unlike a digital computer, which encodes

     information in binary digits (zeroes and ones), a quantum computer stores and manipulates data in the form

     of quantum bits, or qubits. In general, a qubit is not in a state of zero or one, but rather in a mixed state of zero

     and one. If a large number of qubits are placed in the same quantum state, the measurement of an individual

     qubit would produce a zero with a probability p, and a one with a probability  Many scientists believe

     that quantum computers are the future of the computer industry.

Complex Conjugates

Later in this section, you will see how to use the wave function to describe particles that are "free" or bound by

forces to other particles. The specific form of the wave function depends on the details of the physical system.

A peculiarity of quantum theory is that these functions are usually complex functions. A complex function is

one that contains one or more imaginary numbers        . Experimental measurements produce real

(nonimaginary) numbers only, so the above procedure to use the wave function must be slightly modified. In

general, the probability that a particle is found in the narrow interval (x, x + dx) at time t is given by

                                                                                                            7.5

where  is the complex conjugate of the wave function. The complex conjugate of a function is obtaining

by replacing every occurrence of           in that function with . This procedure eliminates complex

numbers in all predictions because the product         is always a real number.

Consider the motion of a free particle that moves along the x-direction. As the name suggests, a free particle
experiences no forces and so moves with a constant velocity. As we will see in a later section of this chapter, a
formal quantum mechanical treatment of a free particle indicates that its wave function has real and complex
parts. In particular, the wave function is given by

where A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, and is the angular frequency. Using Euler's formula,
                                   this equation can be written in the form

     Expectation Values

     In classical mechanics, the solution to an equation of motion is a function of a measurable quantity, such as

     x(t), where x is the position and t is the time. Note that the particle has one value of position for any time t. In

     quantum mechanics, however, the solution to an equation of motion is a wave function,  The particle

     has many values of position for any time t, and only the probability density of finding the particle,       ,

     can be known. The average value of position for a large number of particles with the same wave function is
     expected to be

                                                   

                                                                                                                 7.6

                                                 

     This is called the expectation value of the position. It is usually written

                                               

                                                                                                                                   7.7
                                               

     where the x is sandwiched between the wave functions. The reason for this will become apparent soon.
     Formally, x is called the position operator.

     At this point, it is important to stress that a wave function can be written in terms of other quantities as well,
     such as velocity (v), momentum (p), and kinetic energy (K). The expectation value of momentum, for example,
     can be written

     wave function in position,        but seek the expectation of momentum. The procedure for doing this is

                                             

                                                                                                                 7.9

                                           

     where the quantity in parentheses, sandwiched between the wave functions, is called the momentum
     operator in the x-direction. [The momentum operator in Equation 7.9 is said to be the position-space
     representation of the momentum operator.] The momentum operator must act (operate) on the wave function
     to the right, and then the result must be multiplied by the complex conjugate of the wave function on the left,
     before integration. The momentum operator in the x-direction is sometimes denoted

                                                                                                            7.10

     Momentum operators for the y- and z-directions are defined similarly. This operator and many others are
     derived in a more advanced course in modern physics. In some cases, this derivation is relatively simple. For
     example, the kinetic energy operator is just

Thus, if we seek an expectation value of kinetic energy of a particle in one dimension, two successive ordinary
derivatives of the wave function are required before integration.

Expectation-value calculations are often simplified by exploiting the symmetry of wave functions. Symmetric
wave functions can be even or odd. An even function is a function that satisfies

                                                                              7.12

In contrast, an odd function is a function that satisfies

                                                                              7.13

An example of even and odd functions is shown in Figure 7.8. An even function is symmetric about the y-axis.

This function is produced by reflecting      for x > 0 about the vertical y-axis. By comparison, an odd function

is generated by reflecting the function about the y-axis and then about the x-axis. (An odd function is also

referred to as an anti-symmetric function.)

                         Figure 7.8 Examples of even and odd wave functions.

In general, an even function times an even function produces an even function. A simple example of an even

function is the product  (even times even is even). Similarly, an odd function times an odd function

produces an even function, such as x sin x (odd times odd is even). However, an odd function times an even

function produces an odd function, such as     (odd times even is odd). The integral over all space of an odd

function is zero, because the total area of the function above the x-axis cancels the (negative) area below it. As

the next example shows, this property of odd functions is very useful.

     Significance

     The function in the integrand           is odd since it is the product of an odd function (x) and an even

     function         . The integral vanishes because the total area of the function about the x-axis cancels the

     (negative) area below it. The result        is not surprising since the probability density function is

     symmetric about        .

     boundary conditions.) Calculate the expectation values of position, momentum, and kinetic energy.

     Strategy
     We must first normalize the wave function to find A. Then we use the operators to calculate the expectation
     values.

     Solution

     The expectation value of momentum in the x-direction also requires an integral. To set this integral up, the

Significance
The average position of a large number of particles in this state is L/2. The average momentum of these
particles is zero because a given particle is equally likely to be moving right or left. However, the particle is not

Quantum mechanics makes many surprising predictions. However, in 1920, Niels Bohr (founder of the Niels
Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, from which we get the term "Copenhagen interpretation") asserted that the
predictions of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics must agree for all macroscopic systems, such as
orbiting planets, bouncing balls, rocking chairs, and springs. This correspondence principle is now generally
accepted. It suggests the rules of classical mechanics are an approximation of the rules of quantum mechanics
for systems with very large energies. Quantum mechanics describes both the microscopic and macroscopic
world, but classical mechanics describes only the latter.

7.2 The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Describe the physical meaning of the position-momentum uncertainty relation
 · Explain the origins of the uncertainty principle in quantum theory
 · Describe the physical meaning of the energy-time uncertainty relation

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a key principle in quantum mechanics. Very roughly, it states that if we
know everything about where a particle is located (the uncertainty of position is small), we know nothing about
its momentum (the uncertainty of momentum is large), and vice versa. Versions of the uncertainty principle
also exist for other quantities as well, such as energy and time. We discuss the momentum-position and
energy-time uncertainty principles separately.
308  7 · Quantum Mechanics

     Momentum and Position

     To illustrate the momentum-position uncertainty principle, consider a free particle that moves along the

     x-direction. The particle moves with a constant velocity u and momentum  . According to de Broglie's

     relations,  and               . As discussed in the previous section, the wave function for this particle is

     given by

                                                                                                                                           7.14

     and the probability density  
                                               is uniform and independent of time. The particle is equally likely

     to be found anywhere along the x-axis but has definite values of wavelength and wave number, and therefore
     momentum. The uncertainty of position is infinite (we are completely uncertain about position) and the
     uncertainty of the momentum is zero (we are completely certain about momentum). This account of a free
     particle is consistent with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

     Similar statements can be made of localized particles. In quantum theory, a localized particle is modeled by a
     linear superposition of free-particle (or plane-wave) states called a wave packet. An example of a wave packet
     is shown in Figure 7.9. A wave packet contains many wavelengths and therefore by de Broglie's relations many
     momenta--possible in quantum mechanics! This particle also has many values of position, although the
     particle is confined mostly to the interval . The particle can be better localized can be decreased) if
     more plane-wave states of different wavelengths or momenta are added together in the right way is
     increased). According to Heisenberg, these uncertainties obey the following relation.

     The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

     The product of the uncertainty in position of a particle and the uncertainty in its momentum can never be
     less than one-half of the reduced Planck constant:

                                                                                  7.15

     This relation expresses Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. It places limits on what we can know about a
     particle from simultaneous measurements of position and momentum. If is large, is small, and vice
     versa. Equation 7.15 can be derived in a more advanced course in modern physics. Reflecting on this relation
     in his work The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory, Heisenberg wrote "Any use of the words `position'
     and `velocity' with accuracy exceeding that given by [the relation] is just as meaningless as the use of words
     whose sense is not defined."

                 Figure 7.9 Adding together several plane waves of different wavelengths can produce a wave that is relatively localized.

Note that the uncertainty principle has nothing to do with the precision of an experimental apparatus. Even for

perfect measuring devices, these uncertainties would remain because they originate in the wave-like nature of

matter. The precise value of the product  depends on the specific form of the wave function.

Interestingly, the Gaussian function (or bell-curve distribution) gives the minimum value of the uncertainty

product:      

EXAMPLE 7.5

The Uncertainty Principle Large and Small

Determine the minimum uncertainties in the positions of the following objects if their speeds are known with a

precision of    : (a) an electron and (b) a bowling ball of mass 6.0 kg.

Strategy

Given the uncertainty in speed             , we have to first determine the uncertainty in momentum

 and then invert Equation 7.15 to find the uncertainty in position                                    .

Solution

a. For the electron:

                                                                                                          

                                         
                                         

b. For the bowling ball:

                                                                                                    

                                               
                                               

Significance

Unlike the position uncertainty for the electron, the position uncertainty for the bowling ball is immeasurably
small. Planck's constant is very small, so the limitations imposed by the uncertainty principle are not
noticeable in macroscopic systems such as a bowling ball.

        EXAMPLE 7.6

Uncertainty and the Hydrogen Atom

Estimate the ground-state energy of a hydrogen atom using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. (Hint:
According to early experiments, the size of a hydrogen atom is approximately 0.1 nm.)

Strategy
An electron bound to a hydrogen atom can be modeled by a particle bound to a one-dimensional box of length

                  The ground-state wave function of this system is a half wave, like that given in Example 7.1. This
is the largest wavelength that can "fit" in the box, so the wave function corresponds to the lowest energy state.
Note that this function is very similar in shape to a Gaussian (bell curve) function. We can take the average
energy of a particle described by this function (E) as a good estimate of the ground state energy . This
average energy of a particle is related to its average of the momentum squared, which is related to its
momentum uncertainty.

Solution
To solve this problem, we must be specific about what is meant by "uncertainty of position" and "uncertainty
310  7 · Quantum Mechanics

     of momentum." We identify the uncertainty of position    with the standard deviation of position , and

     the uncertainty of momentum       with the standard deviation of momentum . For the Gaussian function,

     the uncertainty product is

                                                            

     where

     The particle is equally likely to be moving left as moving right, so  . Also, the uncertainty of position is

     comparable to the size of the box, so     The estimated ground state energy is therefore

                                                                             

     Multiplying numerator and denominator by  gives

                                      

     Significance
     Based on early estimates of the size of a hydrogen atom and the uncertainty principle, the ground-state energy
     of a hydrogen atom is in the eV range. The ionization energy of an electron in the ground-state energy is

     approximately 10 eV, so this prediction is roughly confirmed. (Note: The product  is often a useful value in

     performing calculations in quantum mechanics.)

     Energy and Time

     Another kind of uncertainty principle concerns uncertainties in simultaneous measurements of the energy of
     a quantum state and its lifetime,

                                                                       7.16

     where is the uncertainty in the energy measurement and is the uncertainty in the lifetime
     measurement. The energy-time uncertainty principle does not result from a relation of the type expressed
     by Equation 7.15 for technical reasons beyond this discussion. Nevertheless, the general meaning of the
     energy-time principle is that a quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a definite energy.
     The reason is that the frequency of a state is inversely proportional to time and the frequency connects with
     the energy of the state, so to measure the energy with good precision, the state must be observed for many
     cycles.

     To illustrate, consider the excited states of an atom. The finite lifetimes of these states can be deduced from the
     shapes of spectral lines observed in atomic emission spectra. Each time an excited state decays, the emitted
     energy is slightly different and, therefore, the emission line is characterized by a distribution of spectral
     frequencies (or wavelengths) of the emitted photons. As a result, all spectral lines are characterized by spectral
     widths. The average energy of the emitted photon corresponds to the theoretical energy of the excited state
     and gives the spectral location of the peak of the emission line. Short-lived states have broad spectral widths
     and long-lived states have narrow spectral widths.

In the preceding two sections, we described how to use a quantum mechanical wave function and discussed
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. In this section, we present a complete and formal theory of quantum
mechanics that can be used to make predictions. In developing this theory, it is helpful to review the wave
theory of light. For a light wave, the electric field E(x,t) obeys the relation

where c is the speed of light and the symbol represents a partial derivative. (Recall from Oscillations that a

partial derivative is closely related to an ordinary derivative, but involves functions of more than one variable.

When taking the partial derivative of a function by a certain variable, all other variables are held constant.) A

light wave consists of a very large number of photons, so the quantity     can interpreted as a probability

density of finding a single photon at a particular point in space (for example, on a viewing screen).

     According to de Broglie's equations, we have   and                                                               7.19

                                                          . Substituting these equations in Equation

                                                                                                               7.20

     or

                                                                                                                                                          7.21

     Therefore, according to Einstein's general energy-momentum equation (Equation 5.11), Equation 7.17
     describes a particle with a zero rest mass. This is consistent with our knowledge of a photon.

     This process can be reversed. We can begin with the energy-momentum equation of a particle and then ask
     what wave equation corresponds to it. The energy-momentum equation of a nonrelativistic particle in one
     dimension is

                                                                                                               7.22

     where p is the momentum, m is the mass, and U is the potential energy of the particle. The wave equation that
     goes with it turns out to be a key equation in quantum mechanics, called Schrdinger's time-dependent
     equation.

     The Schrdinger Time-Dependent Equation

     The equation describing the energy and momentum of a wave function is known as the Schrdinger
     equation:

                                                                                                    7.23

     As described in Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy, the force on the particle described by this
     equation is given by

                                                                                                               7.24

     This equation plays a role in quantum mechanics similar to Newton's second law in classical mechanics. Once
     the potential energy of a particle is specified--or, equivalently, once the force on the particle is specified--we
     can solve this differential equation for the wave function. The solution to Newton's second law equation (also a
     differential equation) in one dimension is a function x(t) that specifies where an object is at any time t. The
     solution to Schrdinger's time-dependent equation provides a tool--the wave function--that can be used to
     determine where the particle is likely to be. This equation can be also written in two or three dimensions.
     Solving Schrdinger's time-dependent equation often requires the aid of a computer.

     Consider the special case of a free particle. A free particle experiences no force  Based on Equation
     7.24, this requires only that

                                                                                                               7.25

     For simplicity, we set            . Schrdinger's equation then reduces to

                                                                                                          7.26

A valid solution to this equation is

                                                                                                          7.27

Not surprisingly, this solution contains an imaginary number         because the differential equation

itself contains an imaginary number. As stressed before, however, quantum-mechanical predictions depend

only on            , which yields completely real values. Notice that the real plane-wave solutions,

                           and                          do not obey Schrödinger's equation. The temptation

to think that a wave function can be seen, touched, and felt in nature is eliminated by the appearance of an

imaginary number. In Schrdinger's theory of quantum mechanics, the wave function is merely a tool for

calculating things.

If the potential energy function (U) does not depend on time, it is possible to show that

                                                                                                          7.28

satisfies Schrdinger's time-dependent equation, where         is a time-independent function and          is a

space-independent function. In other words, the wave function is separable into two parts: a space-only part

and a time-only part. The factor      is sometimes referred to as a time-modulation factor since it modifies

the space-only function. According to de Broglie, the energy of a matter wave is given by         , where E is

its total energy. Thus, the above equation can also be written as

                                                                                                          7.29

Any linear combination of such states (mixed state of energy or momentum) is also valid solution to this
equation. Such states can, for example, describe a localized particle (see Figure 7.9)

where E is the total energy of the particle (a real number). This equation is called Schrdinger's time-
independent equation. Notice that we use "big psi" for the time-dependent wave function and "little psi"

     for the time-independent wave function. The wave-function solution to this equation must be multiplied
by the time-modulation factor to obtain the time-dependent wave function.

In the next sections, we solve Schrdinger's time-independent equation for three cases: a quantum particle in

a box, a simple harmonic oscillator, and a quantum barrier. These cases provide important lessons that can be

used to solve more complicated systems. The time-independent wave function  solutions must satisfy

three conditions:

·        must be a continuous function.

· The first derivative of       with respect to space,             , must be continuous, unless       .

·        must not diverge ("blow up") at    
314  7 · Quantum Mechanics

     The first condition avoids sudden jumps or gaps in the wave function. The second condition requires the wave

     function to be smooth at all points, except in special cases. (In a more advanced course on quantum

     mechanics, for example, potential spikes of infinite depth and height are used to model solids). The third

     condition requires the wave function be normalizable. This third condition follows from Born's interpretation

     of quantum mechanics. It ensures that  is a finite number so we can use it to calculate probabilities.

     7.4 The Quantum Particle in a Box

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe how to set up a boundary-value problem for the stationary Schrdinger equation
      · Explain why the energy of a quantum particle in a box is quantized
      · Describe the physical meaning of stationary solutions to Schrdinger's equation and the connection of these

           solutions with time-dependent quantum states
      · Explain the physical meaning of Bohr's correspondence principle

     In this section, we apply Schrdinger's equation to a particle bound to a one-dimensional box. This special
     case provides lessons for understanding quantum mechanics in more complex systems. The energy of the
     particle is quantized as a consequence of a standing wave condition inside the box.

     Consider a particle of mass that is allowed to move only along the x-direction and its motion is confined to

     the region between hard and rigid walls located at  and at  (Figure 7.10). Between the walls, the

     particle moves freely. This physical situation is called the infinite square well, described by the potential

     energy function

                                                                                                                    7.31
                                                                                                                    7.32
     Combining this equation with Schrdinger's time-independent wave equation gives

                                               

     where E is the total energy of the particle. What types of solutions do we expect? The energy of the particle is a

     positive number, so if the value of the wave function is positive (right side of the equation), the curvature of the

     wave function is negative, or concave down (left side of the equation). Similarly, if the value of the wave

     function is negative (right side of the equation), the curvature of the wave function is positive or concave up

     (left side of equation). This condition is met by an oscillating wave function, such as a sine or cosine wave.

     Since these waves are confined to the box, we envision standing waves with fixed endpoints at        and

                 Figure 7.10 The potential energy function that confines the particle in a one-dimensional box.

Solutions       to this equation have a probabilistic interpretation. In particular, the square                  represents

the probability density of finding the particle at a particular location x. This function must be integrated to
determine the probability of finding the particle in some interval of space. We are therefore looking for a
normalizable solution that satisfies the following normalization condition:

                                                                                                                 7.33

The walls are rigid and impenetrable, which means that the particle is never found beyond the wall.
Mathematically, this means that the solution must vanish at the walls:

                                                                                                                 7.34

We expect oscillating solutions, so the most general solution to this equation is

                                                                                                                 7.35

where k is the wave number, and and are constants. Applying the boundary condition expressed by
Equation 7.34 gives

                                                                                                                 7.36

Because we have  , the solution must be

                                                                                                                 7.37

If is zero,      for all values of x and the normalization condition, Equation 7.33, cannot be satisfied.
Assuming

                                                                                                                 7.38

We discard the   solution because     for this quantum number would be zero everywhere--an un-

normalizable and therefore unphysical solution. Substituting Equation 7.37 into Equation 7.32 gives

                                      

                                                                                                                                       7.39

Computing these derivatives leads to                                                                             7.40

                                                                

According to de Broglie,  so this expression implies that the total energy is equal to the kinetic energy,

consistent with our assumption that the "particle moves freely." Combining the results of Equation 7.38 and
Equation 7.40 gives

     Strange! A particle bound to a one-dimensional box can only have certain discrete (quantized) values of
     energy. Further, the particle cannot have a zero kinetic energy--it is impossible for a particle bound to a box to
     be "at rest."
     To evaluate the allowed wave functions that correspond to these energies, we must find the normalization
     constant . We impose the normalization condition Equation 7.33 on the wave function

                                                                                                                                                          7.42

     Hence, the wave functions that correspond to the energy values given in Equation 7.41 are

     For the lowest energy state or ground state energy, we have                                                7.44

                                                      

     All other energy states can be expressed as

                                                                                                                7.45

     The index n is called the energy quantum number or principal quantum number. The state for             is the

     first excited state, the state for  is the second excited state, and so on. The first three quantum states (for

     of a particle in a box are shown in Figure 7.11.

     The wave functions in Equation 7.45 are sometimes referred to as the "states of definite energy." Particles in
     these states are said to occupy energy levels, which are represented by the horizontal lines in Figure 7.11.
     Energy levels are analogous to rungs of a ladder that the particle can "climb" as it gains or loses energy.

     The wave functions in Equation 7.45 are also called stationary states and standing wave states. These

     functions are "stationary," because their probability density functions,  , do not vary in time, and

     "standing waves" because their real and imaginary parts oscillate up and down like a standing wave--like a

     rope waving between two children on a playground. Stationary states are states of definite energy [Equation

     7.45], but linear combinations of these states, such as                   (also solutions to Schrdinger's

     equation) are states of mixed energy.

wave solutions and (b) allowed energy states.

Energy quantization is a consequence of the boundary conditions. If the particle is not confined to a box but
wanders freely, the allowed energies are continuous. However, in this case, only certain energies

                     ...) are allowed. The energy difference between adjacent energy levels is given by

                                                                                                         7.46

Conservation of energy demands that if the energy of the system changes, the energy difference is carried in
some other form of energy. For the special case of a charged particle confined to a small volume (for example,
in an atom), energy changes are often carried away by photons. The frequencies of the emitted photons give us
information about the energy differences (spacings) of the system and the volume of containment--the size of
the "box" [see Equation 7.44].

     This is the typical frequency of a gamma ray emitted by a nucleus. The energy of this photon is about 10

     The expectation value of the position for a particle in a box is given by

                                                                                                               7.47

     We can also find the expectation value of the momentum or average momentum of a large number of particles
     in a given state:

     Thus, for a particle in a state of definite energy, the average position is in the middle of the box and the average
     momentum of the particle is zero--as it would also be for a classical particle. Note that while the minimum
     energy of a classical particle can be zero (the particle can be at rest in the middle of the box), the minimum
     energy of a quantum particle is nonzero and given by Equation 7.44. The average particle energy in the nth
     quantum state--its expectation value of energy--is

                                                                           7.49

     The result is not surprising because the standing wave state is a state of definite energy. Any energy
     measurement of this system must return a value equal to one of these allowed energies.

     Our analysis of the quantum particle in a box would not be complete without discussing Bohr's
     correspondence principle. This principle states that for large quantum numbers, the laws of quantum physics
     must give identical results as the laws of classical physics. To illustrate how this principle works for a quantum
     particle in a box, we plot the probability density distribution

                                                                                                                                                          7.50

     7.12 shows these probability distributions for the ground state, for the first excited state, and for a highly
     excited state that corresponds to a large quantum number. We see from these plots that when a quantum
     particle is in the ground state, it is most likely to be found around the middle of the box, where the probability

distribution has the largest value. This is not so when the particle is in the first excited state because now the
probability distribution has the zero value in the middle of the box, so there is no chance of finding the particle
there. When a quantum particle is in the first excited state, the probability distribution has two maxima, and
the best chance of finding the particle is at positions close to the locations of these maxima. This quantum
picture is unlike the classical picture.

Figure 7.12 The probability density distribution          for a quantum particle in a box for: (a) the ground state,  ; (b) the first

excited state,  ; and, (c) the nineteenth excited state,  .

The probability density of finding a classical particle between x and  depends on how much time the

particle spends in this region. Assuming that its speed u is constant, this time is                                   which is also

constant for any location between the walls. Therefore, the probability density of finding the classical particle

at x is uniform throughout the box, and there is no preferable location for finding a classical particle. This

classical picture is matched in the limit of large quantum numbers. For example, when a quantum particle is

in a highly excited state, shown in Figure 7.12, the probability density is characterized by rapid fluctuations

and then the probability of finding the quantum particle in the interval does not depend on where this

interval is located between the walls.

EXAMPLE 7.9

A Classical Particle in a Box

A small 0.40-kg cart is moving back and forth along an air track between two bumpers located 2.0 m apart. We
assume no friction; collisions with the bumpers are perfectly elastic so that between the bumpers, the car
maintains a constant speed of 0.50 m/s. Treating the cart as a quantum particle, estimate the value of the
principal quantum number that corresponds to its classical energy.

Strategy

We find the kinetic energy K of the cart and its ground state energy as though it were a quantum particle.

The energy of the cart is completely kinetic, so             (Equation 7.45). Solving for n gives                                      .

Solution
The kinetic energy of the cart is

     Therefore,                                                             .

     Significance

     We see from this example that the energy of a classical system is characterized by a very large quantum
     number. Bohr's correspondence principle concerns this kind of situation. We can apply the formalism of
     quantum mechanics to any kind of system, quantum or classical, and the results are correct in each case. In
     the limit of high quantum numbers, there is no advantage in using quantum formalism because we can obtain
     the same results with the less complicated formalism of classical mechanics. However, we cannot apply
     classical formalism to a quantum system in a low-number energy state.

     7.5 The Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe the model of the quantum harmonic oscillator
      · Identify differences between the classical and quantum models of the harmonic oscillator
      · Explain physical situations where the classical and the quantum models coincide

     Oscillations are found throughout nature, in such things as electromagnetic waves, vibrating molecules, and
     the gentle back-and-forth sway of a tree branch. In previous chapters, we used Newtonian mechanics to study
     macroscopic oscillations, such as a block on a spring and a simple pendulum. In this chapter, we begin to study
     oscillating systems using quantum mechanics. We begin with a review of the classic harmonic oscillator.

     The Classic Harmonic Oscillator

     A simple harmonic oscillator is a particle or system that undergoes harmonic motion about an equilibrium
     position, such as an object with mass vibrating on a spring. In this section, we consider oscillations in one-
     dimension only. Suppose a mass moves back-and-forth along the

x-direction about the equilibrium position,  . In classical mechanics, the particle moves in response to a

linear restoring force given by            where x is the displacement of the particle from its equilibrium

position. The motion takes place between two turning points,          , where A denotes the amplitude of the

motion. The position of the object varies periodically in time with angular frequency         which

depends on the mass m of the oscillator and on the force constant k of the net force, and can be written as

                                                                                                                            7.52

The total energy E of an oscillator is the sum of its kinetic energy  and the elastic potential energy of

the force          

                                                                                                                            7.53

At turning points    , the speed of the oscillator is zero; therefore, at these points, the energy of oscillation

is solely in the form of potential energy      . The plot of the potential energy U(x) of the oscillator

versus its position x is a parabola (Figure 7.13). The potential-energy function is a quadratic function of x,

measured with respect to the equilibrium position. On the same graph, we also plot the total energy E of the

oscillator, as a horizontal line that intercepts the parabola at      . Then the kinetic energy K is represented

as the vertical distance between the line of total energy and the potential energy parabola.

Figure 7.13 The potential energy well of a classical harmonic oscillator: The motion is confined between turning points at  and at
           . The energy of oscillations is

In this plot, the motion of a classical oscillator is confined to the region where its kinetic energy is nonnegative,
which is what the energy relation Equation 7.53 says. Physically, it means that a classical oscillator can never
be found beyond its turning points, and its energy depends only on how far the turning points are from its
equilibrium position. The energy of a classical oscillator changes in a continuous way. The lowest energy that a
classical oscillator may have is zero, which corresponds to a situation where an object is at rest at its
equilibrium position. The zero-energy state of a classical oscillator simply means no oscillations and no
motion at all (a classical particle sitting at the bottom of the potential well in Figure 7.13). When an object
oscillates, no matter how big or small its energy may be, it spends the longest time near the turning points,
because this is where it slows down and reverses its direction of motion. Therefore, the probability of finding a
classical oscillator between the turning points is highest near the turning points and lowest at the equilibrium
position. (Note that this is not a statement of preference of the object to go to lower energy. It is a statement
about how quickly the object moves through various regions.)
322  7 · Quantum Mechanics

     The Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

     One problem with this classical formulation is that it is not general. We cannot use it, for example, to describe

     vibrations of diatomic molecules, where quantum effects are important. A first step toward a quantum

     formulation is to use the classical expression      to limit mention of a "spring" constant between the

     atoms. In this way the potential energy function can be written in a more general form,

                                                                                                                7.54

     Combining this expression with the time-independent Schrdinger equation gives

                                                                                                                7.55
                                              

     To solve Equation 7.55--that is, to find the allowed energies E and their corresponding wave functions

     --we require the wave functions to be symmetric about       (the bottom of the potential well) and to be

     normalizable. These conditions ensure that the probability density   must be finite when integrated

     over the entire range of x from  to  . How to solve Equation 7.55 is the subject of a more advanced course

     in quantum mechanics; here, we simply cite the results. The allowed energies are

                                                                                                                7.56

Find the amplitude A of oscillations for a classical oscillator with energy equal to the energy of a quantum
oscillator in the quantum state n.

Strategy                                                                     equal to given by
To determine the amplitude A, we set the classical energy
Equation 7.56.

Solution
We obtain

                                                                             

                                                                             

Significance

As the quantum number n increases, the energy of the oscillator and therefore the amplitude of oscillation
increases (for a fixed natural angular frequency. For large n, the amplitude is approximately proportional to
the square root of the quantum number.

Several interesting features appear in this solution. Unlike a classical oscillator, the measured energies of a
quantum oscillator can have only energy values given by Equation 7.56. Moreover, unlike the case for a
quantum particle in a box, the allowable energy levels are evenly spaced,

                                                                                                7.58

When a particle bound to such a system makes a transition from a higher-energy state to a lower-energy state,
the smallest-energy quantum carried by the emitted photon is necessarily hf. Similarly, when the particle
makes a transition from a lower-energy state to a higher-energy state, the smallest-energy quantum that can
324  7 · Quantum Mechanics

     be absorbed by the particle is hf. A quantum oscillator can absorb or emit energy only in multiples of this
     smallest-energy quantum. This is consistent with Planck's hypothesis for the energy exchanges between
     radiation and the cavity walls in the blackbody radiation problem.

     EXAMPLE 7.11

     Vibrational Energies of the Hydrogen Chloride Molecule

     The HCl diatomic molecule consists of one chlorine atom and one hydrogen atom. Because the chlorine atom

     is 35 times more massive than the hydrogen atom, the vibrations of the HCl molecule can be quite well

     approximated by assuming that the Cl atom is motionless and the H atom performs harmonic oscillations due

     to an elastic molecular force modeled by Hooke's law. The infrared vibrational spectrum measured for

     hydrogen chloride has the lowest-frequency line centered at                 . What is the spacing

     between the vibrational energies of this molecule? What is the force constant k of the atomic bond in the HCl

     molecule?

     Strategy

     The lowest-frequency line corresponds to the emission of lowest-frequency photons. These photons are

     emitted when the molecule makes a transition between two adjacent vibrational energy levels. Assuming that

     energy levels are equally spaced, we use Equation 7.58 to estimate the spacing. The molecule is well

     approximated by treating the Cl atom as being infinitely heavy and the H atom as the mass m that performs the

     oscillations. Treating this molecular system as a classical oscillator, the force constant is found from the

     classical relation      .

     Solution
     The energy spacing is

                                      

     The force constant is

                           

     Significance

     The force between atoms in an HCl molecule is surprisingly strong. The typical energy released in energy
     transitions between vibrational levels is in the infrared range. As we will see later, transitions in between
     vibrational energy levels of a diatomic molecule often accompany transitions between rotational energy levels.

     The quantum oscillator differs from the classic oscillator in three ways:

     First, the ground state of a quantum oscillator is   not zero. In the classical view, the lowest energy

     is zero. The nonexistence of a zero-energy state is common for all quantum-mechanical systems because of
     omnipresent fluctuations that are a consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. If a quantum
     particle sat motionless at the bottom of the potential well, its momentum as well as its position would have to
     be simultaneously exact, which would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Therefore, the lowest-
     energy state must be characterized by uncertainties in momentum and in position, so the ground state of a

quantum particle must lie above the bottom of the potential well.

Second, a particle in a quantum harmonic oscillator potential can be found with nonzero probability outside

the interval   . In a classic formulation of the problem, the particle would not have any energy to

be in this region. The probability of finding a ground-state quantum particle in the classically forbidden region

is about 16%.

Third, the probability density distributions   for a quantum oscillator in the ground low-energy state,

, is largest at the middle of the well        . For the particle to be found with greatest probability at the

center of the well, we expect that the particle spends the most time there as it oscillates. This is opposite to the

behavior of a classical oscillator, in which the particle spends most of its time moving with relative small

speeds near the turning points.

Quantum probability density distributions change in character for excited states, becoming more like the

classical distribution when the quantum number gets higher. We observe this change already for the first

and vanishes at the equilibrium position, as seen in Figure 7.13. In accordance with Bohr's correspondence

principle, in the limit of high quantum numbers, the quantum description of a harmonic oscillator converges

to the classical description, which is illustrated in Figure 7.15. The classical probability density distribution

corresponding to the quantum energy of the    state is a reasonably good approximation of the quantum

probability distribution for a quantum oscillator in this excited state. This agreement becomes increasingly

better for highly excited states.

     7.6 The Quantum Tunneling of Particles through Potential
     Barriers

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe how a quantum particle may tunnel across a potential barrier
      · Identify important physical parameters that affect the tunneling probability
      · Identify the physical phenomena where quantum tunneling is observed
      · Explain how quantum tunneling is utilized in modern technologies

     Quantum tunneling is a phenomenon in which particles penetrate a potential energy barrier with a height
     greater than the total energy of the particles. The phenomenon is interesting and important because it violates
     the principles of classical mechanics. Quantum tunneling is important in models of the Sun and has a wide
     range of applications, such as the scanning tunneling microscope and the tunnel diode.

     Tunneling and Potential Energy

     To illustrate quantum tunneling, consider a ball rolling along a surface with a kinetic energy of 100 J. As the
     ball rolls, it encounters a hill. The potential energy of the ball placed atop the hill is 10 J. Therefore, the ball
     (with 100 J of kinetic energy) easily rolls over the hill and continues on. In classical mechanics, the probability
     that the ball passes over the hill is exactly 1--it makes it over every time. If, however, the height of the hill is
     increased--a ball placed atop the hill has a potential energy of 200 J--the ball proceeds only part of the way up
     the hill, stops, and returns in the direction it came. The total energy of the ball is converted entirely into
     potential energy before it can reach the top of the hill. We do not expect, even after repeated attempts, for the
     100-J ball to ever be found beyond the hill. Therefore, the probability that the ball passes over the hill is exactly
     0, and probability it is turned back or "reflected" by the hill is exactly 1. The ball never makes it over the hill.
     The existence of the ball beyond the hill is an impossibility or "energetically forbidden."

     However, according to quantum mechanics, the ball has a wave function and this function is defined over all
     space. The wave function may be highly localized, but there is always a chance that as the ball encounters the
     hill, the ball will suddenly be found beyond it. Indeed, this probability is appreciable if the "wave packet" of the
     ball is wider than the barrier.

          INTERACTIVE

     View this interactive simulation (https://openstax.org/l/21intquatanvid) for a simulation of tunneling.

     In the language of quantum mechanics, the hill is characterized by a potential barrier. A finite-height square
     barrier is described by the following potential-energy function:

                                       7.59

     The potential barrier is illustrated in Figure 7.16. When the height of the barrier is infinite, the wave packet
     representing an incident quantum particle is unable to penetrate it, and the quantum particle bounces back
     from the barrier boundary, just like a classical particle. When the width L of the barrier is infinite and its height
     is finite, a part of the wave packet representing an incident quantum particle can filter through the barrier
     boundary and eventually perish after traveling some distance inside the barrier.

Figure 7.16 A potential energy barrier of height creates three physical regions with three different wave behaviors. In region I where

, an incident wave packet (incident particle) moves in a potential-free zone and coexists with a reflected wave packet (reflected

particle). In region II, a part of the incident wave that has not been reflected at  moves as a transmitted wave in a constant potential

            and tunnels through to region III at  . In region III for                , a wave packet (transmitted particle) that has tunneled

through the potential barrier moves as a free particle in potential-free zone. The energy E of the incident particle is indicated by the

horizontal line.

When both the width L and the height are finite, a part of the quantum wave packet incident on one side of
the barrier can penetrate the barrier boundary and continue its motion inside the barrier, where it is gradually
attenuated on its way to the other side. A part of the incident quantum wave packet eventually emerges on the
other side of the barrier in the form of the transmitted wave packet that tunneled through the barrier. How
much of the incident wave can tunnel through a barrier depends on the barrier width L and its height , and
on the energy E of the quantum particle incident on the barrier. This is the physics of tunneling.

Barrier penetration by quantum wave functions was first analyzed theoretically by Friedrich Hund in 1927,
shortly after Schrdinger published the equation that bears his name. A year later, George Gamow used the
formalism of quantum mechanics to explain the radioactive -decay of atomic nuclei as a quantum-tunneling
phenomenon. The invention of the tunnel diode in 1957 made it clear that quantum tunneling is important to
the semiconductor industry. In modern nanotechnologies, individual atoms are manipulated using a
knowledge of quantum tunneling.

Tunneling and the Wave Function

Suppose a uniform and time-independent beam of electrons or other quantum particles with energy E
traveling along the x-axis (in the positive direction to the right) encounters a potential barrier described by
Equation 7.59. The question is: What is the probability that an individual particle in the beam will tunnel
through the potential barrier? The answer can be found by solving the boundary-value problem for the time-
independent Schrdinger equation for a particle in the beam. The general form of this equation is given by
Equation 7.60, which we reproduce here:

                                                                                                                                          7.60

In Equation 7.60, the potential function U(x) is defined by Equation 7.59. We assume that the given energy E of

the incoming particle is smaller than the height of the potential barrier,             , because this is the

interesting physical case. Knowing the energy E of the incoming particle, our task is to solve Equation 7.60 for

a function        that is continuous and has continuous first derivatives for all x. In other words, we are looking

for a "smooth-looking" solution (because this is how wave functions look) that can be given a probabilistic

interpretation so that                            is the probability density.

     We divide the real axis into three regions with the boundaries defined by the potential function in Equation

     7.59 (illustrated in Figure 7.16) and transcribe Equation 7.60 for each region. Denoting by  the solution in

     region I for    , by              the solution in region II for     , and by    the solution in region III for

     The continuity condition at region boundaries requires that:
                                                                                                                                                          7.64

     The "smoothness" condition requires the first derivative of the solution be continuous at region boundaries:

     In what follows, we find the functions  ,          , and         .

     We can easily verify (by substituting into the original equation and differentiating) that in regions I and III, the
     solutions must be in the following general forms:

                                                                                                               7.70

     The constants A, B, F, and G in Equation 7.68 and Equation 7.69 may be complex. These solutions are

     illustrated in Figure 7.16. In region I, there are two waves--one is incident (moving to the right) and one is

     reflected (moving to the left)--so none of the constants A and B in Equation 7.68 may vanish. In region III, there

     is only one wave (moving to the right), which is the transmitted wave, so the constant G must be zero in

     Equation 7.69,         . We can write explicitly that the incident wave is        and that the reflected

     wave is                , and that the transmitted wave is                     . The amplitude of the incident

     wave is

     Similarly, the amplitude of the reflected wave is                   and the amplitude of the transmitted wave is

                     . We know from the theory of waves that the square of the wave amplitude is directly

     proportional to the wave intensity. If we want to know how much of the incident wave tunnels through the

     barrier, we need to compute the square of the amplitude of the transmitted wave. The transmission

     probability or tunneling probability is the ratio of the transmitted intensity    to the incident intensity

In region II, the terms in equation Equation 7.62 can be rearranged to

exponentials that describe a gradual attenuation of  ,

Now we use the boundary conditions to find equations for the unknown constants. Equation 7.68 and Equation
7.74 are substituted into Equation 7.64 to give

Similarly, we substitute Equation 7.68 and Equation 7.74 into Equation 7.66, differentiate, and obtain

     Similarly, the boundary condition Equation 7.67 reads explicitly

                                                                                                                                                          7.78

     We now have four equations for five unknown constants. However, because the quantity we are after is the
     transmission coefficient, defined in Equation 7.71 by the fraction F/A, the number of equations is exactly right
     because when we divide each of the above equations by A, we end up having only four unknown fractions: B/A,
     C/A, D/A, and F/A, three of which can be eliminated to find F/A. The actual algebra that leads to expression for
     F/A is pretty lengthy, but it can be done either by hand or with a help of computer software. The end result is

                                                                                                                  7.79

     In deriving Equation 7.79, to avoid the clutter, we use the substitutions  ,

     We substitute Equation 7.79 into Equation 7.71 and obtain the exact expression for the transmission
     coefficient for the barrier,

     or                                                                                                           7.80
     where

     For a wide and high barrier that transmits poorly, Equation 7.80 can be approximated by

                                                                                                                  7.81

     Whether it is the exact expression Equation 7.80 or the approximate expression Equation 7.81, we see that the
     tunneling effect very strongly depends on the width L of the potential barrier. In the laboratory, we can adjust
     both the potential height and the width L to design nano-devices with desirable transmission coefficients.

            EXAMPLE 7.12

     Transmission Coefficient

     Two copper nanowires are insulated by a copper oxide nano-layer that provides a 10.0-eV potential barrier.
     Estimate the tunneling probability between the nanowires by 7.00-eV electrons through a 5.00-nm thick oxide
     layer. What if the thickness of the layer were reduced to just 1.00 nm? What if the energy of electrons were
     increased to 9.00 eV?

Significance
We see from these estimates that the probability of tunneling is affected more by the width of the potential
barrier than by the energy of an incident particle. In today's technologies, we can manipulate individual atoms
on metal surfaces to create potential barriers that are fractions of a nanometer, giving rise to measurable
tunneling currents. One of many applications of this technology is the scanning tunneling microscope (STM),
which we discuss later in this section.

A proton with kinetic energy 1.00 eV is incident on a square potential barrier with height 10.00 eV. If the
proton is to have the same transmission probability as an electron of the same energy, what must the width of
the barrier be relative to the barrier width encountered by an electron?

Radioactive Decay

In 1928, Gamow identified quantum tunneling as the mechanism responsible for the radioactive decay of
atomic nuclei. He observed that some isotopes of thorium, uranium, and bismuth disintegrate by emitting

 -particles (which are doubly ionized helium atoms or, simply speaking, helium nuclei). In the process of
emitting an -particle, the original nucleus is transformed into a new nucleus that has two fewer neutrons and
two fewer protons than the original nucleus. The -particles emitted by one isotope have approximately the
332  7 · Quantum Mechanics

     same kinetic energies. When we look at variations of these energies among isotopes of various elements, the
     lowest kinetic energy is about 4 MeV and the highest is about 9 MeV, so these energies are of the same order of
     magnitude. This is about where the similarities between various isotopes end.

     When we inspect half-lives (a half-life is the time in which a radioactive sample loses half of its nuclei due to

     decay), different isotopes differ widely. For example, the half-life of polonium-214 is  and the half-life of

     uranium is 4.5 billion years. Gamow explained this variation by considering a `spherical-box' model of the

     nucleus, where -particles can bounce back and forth between the walls as free particles. The confinement is

     provided by a strong nuclear potential at a spherical wall of the box. The thickness of this wall, however, is not

     infinite but finite, so in principle, a nuclear particle has a chance to escape this nuclear confinement. On the

     inside wall of the confining barrier is a high nuclear potential that keeps the -particle in a small confinement.

     But when an -particle gets out to the other side of this wall, it is subject to electrostatic Coulomb repulsion

     and moves away from the nucleus. This idea is illustrated in Figure 7.18. The width L of the potential barrier

     that separates an -particle from the outside world depends on the particle's kinetic energy E. This width is the

     distance between the point marked by the nuclear radius R and the point where an -particle emerges on

     the other side of the barrier,      . At the distance , its kinetic energy must at least match the

     electrostatic energy of repulsion,                 (where  is the charge of the nucleus). In this way

     we can estimate the width of the nuclear barrier,

     We see from this estimate that the higher the energy of -particle, the narrower the width of the barrier that it
     is to tunnel through. We also know that the width of the potential barrier is the most important parameter in
     tunneling probability. Thus, highly energetic -particles have a good chance to escape the nucleus, and, for
     such nuclei, the nuclear disintegration half-life is short. Notice that this process is highly nonlinear, meaning a
     small increase in the -particle energy has a disproportionately large enhancing effect on the tunneling
     probability and, consequently, on shortening the half-life. This explains why the half-life of polonium that
     emits 8-MeV -particles is only hundreds of milliseconds and the half-life of uranium that emits 4-MeV

      -particles is billions of years.

Field Emission

Field emission is a process of emitting electrons from conducting surfaces due to a strong external electric

field that is applied in the direction normal to the surface (Figure 7.19). As we know from our study of electric

fields in earlier chapters, an applied external electric field causes the electrons in a conductor to move to its

surface and stay there as long as the present external field is not excessively strong. In this situation, we have a

constant electric potential throughout the inside of the conductor, including its surface. In the language of

potential energy, we say that an electron inside the conductor has a constant potential energy

(here, the x means inside the conductor). In the situation represented in Figure 7.19, where the external

electric field is uniform and has magnitude , if an electron happens to be outside the conductor at a distance

x away from its surface, its potential energy would have to be  (here, x denotes distance to the

surface). Taking the origin at the surface, so that  is the location of the surface, we can represent the

potential energy of conduction electrons in a metal as the potential energy barrier shown in Figure 7.20. In the

absence of the external field, the potential energy becomes a step barrier defined by           and by

.

     When an external electric field is strong, conduction electrons at the surface may get detached from it and
     accelerate along electric field lines in a direction antiparallel to the external field, away from the surface. In
     short, conduction electrons may escape from the surface. The field emission can be understood as the
     quantum tunneling of conduction electrons through the potential barrier at the conductor's surface. The
     physical principle at work here is very similar to the mechanism of -emission from a radioactive nucleus.
     Suppose a conduction electron has a kinetic energy E (the average kinetic energy of an electron in a metal is
     the work function for the metal and can be measured, as discussed for the photoelectric effect in Photons
     and Matter Waves), and an external electric field can be locally approximated by a uniform electric field of

strength . The width L of the potential barrier that the electron must cross is the distance from the

conductor's surface to the point outside the surface where its kinetic energy matches the value of its potential

energy in the external field. In Figure 7.20, this distance is measured along the dashed horizontal line

from  to the intercept with  , so the barrier width is

We see that L is inversely proportional to the strength of an external field. When we increase the strength of
the external field, the potential barrier outside the conductor becomes steeper and its width decreases for an
electron with a given kinetic energy. In turn, the probability that an electron will tunnel across the barrier
(conductor surface) becomes exponentially larger. The electrons that emerge on the other side of this barrier
form a current (tunneling-electron current) that can be detected above the surface. The tunneling-electron
current is proportional to the tunneling probability. The tunneling probability depends nonlinearly on the
barrier width L, and L can be changed by adjusting . Therefore, the tunneling-electron current can be tuned
by adjusting the strength of an external electric field at the surface. When the strength of an external electric
field is constant, the tunneling-electron current has different values at different elevations L above the surface.

The quantum tunneling phenomenon at metallic surfaces, which we have just described, is the physical
principle behind the operation of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), invented in 1981 by Gerd Binnig
and Heinrich Rohrer. The STM device consists of a scanning tip (a needle, usually made of tungsten, platinum-
iridium, or gold); a piezoelectric device that controls the tip's elevation in a typical range of 0.4 to 0.7 nm above
the surface to be scanned; some device that controls the motion of the tip along the surface; and a computer to
display images. While the sample is kept at a suitable voltage bias, the scanning tip moves along the surface
(Figure 7.21), and the tunneling-electron current between the tip and the surface is registered at each position.
The amount of the current depends on the probability of electron tunneling from the surface to the tip, which,
in turn, depends on the elevation of the tip above the surface. Hence, at each tip position, the distance from the
tip to the surface is measured by measuring how many electrons tunnel out from the surface to the tip. This
method can give an unprecedented resolution of about 0.001 nm, which is about 1% of the average diameter of
an atom. In this way, we can see individual atoms on the surface, as in the image of a carbon nanotube in
Figure 7.22.

Figure 7.21 In STM, a surface at a constant potential is being scanned by a narrow tip moving along the surface. When the STM tip moves
close to surface atoms, electrons can tunnel from the surface to the tip. This tunneling-electron current is continually monitored while the
tip is in motion. The amount of current at location (x,y) gives information about the elevation of the tip above the surface at this location. In

     Resonant Quantum Tunneling

     Quantum tunneling has numerous applications in semiconductor devices such as electronic circuit
     components or integrated circuits that are designed at nanoscales; hence, the term `nanotechnology.' For
     example, a diode (an electric-circuit element that causes an electron current in one direction to be different
     from the current in the opposite direction, when the polarity of the bias voltage is reversed) can be realized by
     a tunneling junction between two different types of semiconducting materials. In such a tunnel diode,
     electrons tunnel through a single potential barrier at a contact between two different semiconductors. At the
     junction, tunneling-electron current changes nonlinearly with the applied potential difference across the
     junction and may rapidly decrease as the bias voltage is increased. This is unlike the Ohm's law behavior that
     we are familiar with in household circuits. This kind of rapid behavior (caused by quantum tunneling) is
     desirable in high-speed electronic devices.

     Another kind of electronic nano-device utilizes resonant tunneling of electrons through potential barriers

     that occur in quantum dots. A quantum dot is a small region of a semiconductor nanocrystal that is grown, for

     example, in a silicon or aluminum arsenide crystal. Figure 7.23(a) shows a quantum dot of gallium arsenide

     embedded in an aluminum arsenide wafer. The quantum-dot region acts as a potential well of a finite height

     (shown in Figure 7.23(b)) that has two finite-height potential barriers at dot boundaries. Similarly, as for a

     quantum particle in a box (that is, an infinite potential well), lower-lying energies of a quantum particle

     trapped in a finite-height potential well are quantized. The difference between the box and the well potentials

     is that a quantum particle in a box has an infinite number of quantized energies and is trapped in the box

     indefinitely, whereas a quantum particle trapped in a potential well has a finite number of quantized energy

     levels and can tunnel through potential barriers at well boundaries to the outside of the well. Thus, a quantum

     dot of gallium arsenide sitting in aluminum arsenide is a potential well where low-lying energies of an electron

     are quantized, indicated as       in part (b) in the figure. When the energy                           of an electron in the outside

     region of the dot does not match its energy  that it would have in the dot, the electron does not tunnel

     through the region of the dot and there is no current through such a circuit element, even if it were kept at an

     electric voltage difference (bias). However, when this voltage bias is changed in such a way that one of the

     barriers is lowered, so that      and        become aligned, as seen in part (c) of the figure, an electron

     current flows through the dot. When the voltage bias is now increased, this alignment is lost and the current

     stops flowing. When the voltage bias is increased further, the electron tunneling becomes improbable until the

     bias voltage reaches a value for which the outside electron energy matches the next electron energy level in the

     dot. The word `resonance' in the device name means that the tunneling-electron current occurs only when a

     selected energy level is matched by tuning an applied voltage bias, such as in the operation mechanism of the

     resonant-tunneling diode just described. Resonant-tunneling diodes are used as super-fast nano-switches.

consisting of two potential barriers of a quantum dot with no voltage bias. Electron energies  in aluminum arsenide are not aligned

with their energy levels  in the quantum dot, so electrons do not tunnel through the dot. (c) Potential well of the dot with a voltage bias

across the device. A suitably tuned voltage difference distorts the well so that electron-energy levels in the dot are aligned with their

energies in aluminum arsenide, causing the electrons to tunnel through the dot.

INTRODUCTION In this chapter, we use quantum mechanics to study the structure and properties of atoms.
This study introduces ideas and concepts that are necessary to understand more complex systems, such as
molecules, crystals, and metals. As we deepen our understanding of atoms, we build on things we already
know, such as Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom, Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom, and de Broglie's
wave hypothesis.

     be correctly predicted by quantum mechanics and are examined in this chapter.

     8.1 The Hydrogen Atom

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     · Describe the hydrogen atom in terms of wave function, probability density, total energy, and orbital angular

     momentum

     · Identify the physical significance of each of the quantum numbers (           ) of the hydrogen atom

     · Distinguish between the Bohr and Schrödinger models of the atom

     · Use quantum numbers to calculate important information about the hydrogen atom

     The hydrogen atom is the simplest atom in nature and, therefore, a good starting point to study atoms and
     atomic structure. The hydrogen atom consists of a single negatively charged electron that moves about a
     positively charged proton (Figure 8.2). In Bohr's model, the electron is pulled around the proton in a perfectly
     circular orbit by an attractive Coulomb force. The proton is approximately 1800 times more massive than the
     electron, so the proton moves very little in response to the force on the proton by the electron. (This is
     analogous to the Earth-Sun system, where the Sun moves very little in response to the force exerted on it by
     Earth.) An explanation of this effect using Newton's laws is given in Photons and Matter Waves.

                                                   Figure 8.2 A representation of the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.

     With the assumption of a fixed proton, we focus on the motion of the electron.
     In the electric field of the proton, the potential energy of the electron is

                                                                                                                           8.1

     where                 and r is the distance between the electron and the proton. As we saw earlier, the force on an

     object is equal to the negative of the gradient (or slope) of the potential energy function. For the special case of

     a hydrogen atom, the force between the electron and proton is an attractive Coulomb force.

     Notice that the potential energy function U(r) does not vary in time. As a result, Schrödinger's equation of the
     hydrogen atom reduces to two simpler equations: one that depends only on space (x, y, z) and another that
     depends only on time (t). (The separation of a wave function into space- and time-dependent parts for time-
     independent potential energy functions is discussed in Quantum Mechanics.) We are most interested in the
     space-dependent equation:

                                           

                                                                                                                                                            8.2

     where                 is the three-dimensional wave function of the electron, is the mass of the electron,

     and E is the total energy of the electron. Recall that the total wave function                                     is the product of the

     space-dependent wave function     and the time-dependent wave function                                             .

In addition to being time-independent, U(r) is also spherically symmetrical. This suggests that we may solve

Schrödinger's equation more easily if we express it in terms of the spherical coordinates          instead of

rectangular coordinates       . A spherical coordinate system is shown in Figure 8.3. In spherical

coordinates, the variable r is the radial coordinate, is the polar angle (relative to the vertical z-axis), and is

the azimuthal angle (relative to the x-axis). The relationship between spherical and rectangular coordinates is

            Figure 8.3 The relationship between the spherical and rectangular coordinate systems.

The factor  is the magnitude of a vector formed by the projection of the polar vector onto the xy-plane.

Also, the coordinates of x and y are obtained by projecting this vector onto the x- and y-axes, respectively. The

inverse transformation gives

Schrödinger's wave equation for the hydrogen atom in spherical coordinates is discussed in more advanced
courses in modern physics, so we do not consider it in detail here. However, due to the spherical symmetry of
U(r), this equation reduces to three simpler equations: one for each of the three coordinates
Solutions to the time-independent wave function are written as a product of three functions:

where R is the radial function dependent on the radial coordinate r only; is the polar function dependent on
the polar coordinate only; and is the phi function of only. Valid solutions to Schrödinger's equation

             are labeled by the quantum numbers n, l, and m.

(The reasons for these names will be explained in the next section.) The radial function R depends only on n
and l; the polar function depends only on l and m; and the phi function depends only on m. The
dependence of each function on quantum numbers is indicated with subscripts:

Not all sets of quantum numbers (n, l, m) are possible. For example, the orbital angular quantum number l can

never be greater or equal to the principal quantum number  . Specifically, we have

     Physical Significance of the Quantum Numbers

     Each of the three quantum numbers of the hydrogen atom (n, l, m) is associated with a different physical
     quantity. The principal quantum number n is associated with the total energy of the electron, . According
     to Schrödinger's equation:

                                                                                                                                                            8.3

     the electron in a particular state of energy does not radiate.

     How Many Possible States?                                                                                ? What

     For the hydrogen atom, how many possible quantum states correspond to the principal number
     are the energies of these states?

     Strategy

     For a hydrogen atom of a given energy, the number of allowed states depends on its orbital angular

     momentum. We can count these states for each value of the principal quantum number,                      However,

     the total energy depends on the principal quantum number only, which means that we can use Equation 8.3

     and the number of states counted.

     Solution

     If     , the allowed values of l are 0, 1, and 2. If         ,        (1 state). If  ,                   (3 states); and if

         ,                             (5 states). In total, there are                allowed states. Because the total energy

     depends only on the principal quantum number,                   , the energy of each of these states is

Significance

An electron in a hydrogen atom can occupy many different angular momentum states with the very same
energy. As the orbital angular momentum increases, the number of the allowed states with the same energy
increases.

The angular momentum orbital quantum number l is associated with the orbital angular momentum of the

electron in a hydrogen atom. Quantum theory tells us that when the hydrogen atom is in the state     , the

magnitude of its orbital angular momentum is

                                                                                                        8.4

where

This result is slightly different from that found with Bohr's theory, which quantizes angular momentum
according to the rule

Quantum states with different values of orbital angular momentum are distinguished using spectroscopic
notation (Table 8.2). The designations s, p, d, and f result from early historical attempts to classify atomic
spectral lines. (The letters stand for sharp, principal, diffuse, and fundamental, respectively.) After f, the letters
continue alphabetically.

The ground state of hydrogen is designated as the 1s state, where "1" indicates the energy level     and "s"

indicates the orbital angular momentum state ( ). When      , l can be either 0 or 1. The         ,     state

is designated "2s." The  ,  state is designated "2p." When  , l can be 0, 1, or 2, and the states are

3s, 3p, and 3d, respectively. Notation for other quantum states is given in Table 8.3.

Thus, the angle is quantized with the particular values

Notice that both the polar angle ( ) and the projection of the angular momentum vector onto an arbitrary
z-axis ( ) are quantized.

The quantization of the polar angle for the    state is shown in Figure 8.5. The orbital angular momentum

vector lies somewhere on the surface of a cone with an opening angle relative to the z-axis (unless       in

which case  and the vector points are perpendicular to the z-axis).

A detailed study of angular momentum reveals that we cannot know all three components simultaneously. In
the previous section, the z-component of orbital angular momentum has definite values that depend on the
quantum number m. This implies that we cannot know both x- and y-components of angular momentum,
and , with certainty. As a result, the precise direction of the orbital angular momentum vector is unknown.

Using the Wave Function to Make Predictions

As we saw earlier, we can use quantum mechanics to make predictions about physical events by the use of
probability statements. It is therefore proper to state, "An electron is located within this volume with this
probability at this time," but not, "An electron is located at the position (x, y, z) at this time." To determine the
probability of finding an electron in a hydrogen atom in a particular region of space, it is necessary to integrate

the probability density       over that region:

                                                                                                               8.9

where dV is an infinitesimal volume element. If this integral is computed for all space, the result is 1, because
the probability of the particle to be located somewhere is 100% (the normalization condition). In a more

advanced course on modern physics, you will find that                    where                 is the complex

conjugate. This eliminates the occurrences of               in the above calculation.

Consider an electron in a state of zero angular momentum ( ). In this case, the electron's wave function

depends only on the radial coordinate r. (Refer to the states       and  in Table 8.1.) The infinitesimal

volume element corresponds to a spherical shell of radius r and infinitesimal thickness dr, written as

                                                                                                               8.10

The probability of finding the electron in the region r to          ("at approximately r") is

     radial range. To find the most probable radial position, we set the first derivative of this function to zero

     (      ) and solve for r. The most probable radial position is not equal to the average or expectation value

     of the radial position because     is not symmetrical about its peak value.

     If the electron has orbital angular momentum ( ), then the wave functions representing the electron

     depend on the angles and that is,  (r, , ). Atomic orbitals for three states with                           and

     are shown in Figure 8.8. An atomic orbital is a region in space that encloses a certain percentage (usually

     90%) of the electron probability. (Sometimes atomic orbitals are referred to as "clouds" of probability.) Notice

     that these distributions are pronounced in certain directions. This directionality is important to chemists

     when they analyze how atoms are bound together to form molecules.

     regions indicate locations of relatively high and low probability, respectively. In contrast to the Bohr model of

In Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom, the electron moves in a circular orbit around the proton. The electron

passes by a particular point on the loop in a certain time, so we can calculate a current  . An electron

that orbits a proton in a hydrogen atom is therefore analogous to current flowing through a circular wire

(Figure 8.10). In the study of magnetism, we saw that a current-carrying wire produces magnetic fields. It is

therefore reasonable to conclude that the hydrogen atom produces a magnetic field and interacts with other

magnetic fields.

     The orbital magnetic dipole moment is a measure of the strength of the magnetic field produced by the

     where I is the current and A is the area of the loop. (For brevity, we refer to this as the magnetic moment.) The

     where r is the radius of the orbit and v is the speed of the electron in its orbit. Given that the area of a circle is
          , the absolute magnetic moment is

                                                                                                                                                          8.16

     It is helpful to express the magnetic momentum in terms of the orbital angular momentum
     Because the electron orbits in a circle, the position vector and the momentum vector form a right angle.
     Thus, the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum is

                                                                                                                                                          8.17
     Combining these two equations, we have

     In full vector form, this expression is written as

     The negative sign appears because the electron has a negative charge. Notice that the direction of the magnetic
     moment of the electron is antiparallel to the orbital angular momentum, as shown in Figure 8.10(b). In the

The z-component of the magnetic moment is                                                            8.21

                                                                           

The quantity is a fundamental unit of magnetism called the Bohr magneton, which has the value

                     (J/T) or                  Quantization of the magnetic moment is the result of

quantization of the orbital angular momentum.

As we will see in the next section, the total magnetic dipole moment of the hydrogen atom is due to both the
orbital motion of the electron and its intrinsic spin. For now, we ignore the effect of electron spin.

        EXAMPLE 8.3

Orbital Magnetic Dipole Moment

What is the magnitude of the orbital dipole magnetic moment of an electron in the hydrogen atom in the (a) s
state, (b) p state, and (c) d state? (Assume that the spin of the electron is zero.)

Strategy
The magnetic momentum of the electron is related to its orbital angular momentum L. For the hydrogen atom,
this quantity is related to the orbital angular quantum number l. The states are given in spectroscopic
notation, which relates a letter (s, p, d, etc.) to a quantum number.

Solution
The magnitude of the magnetic moment is given in Equation 8.20:

                                                                        

a. For the s state,  so we have     and
b. For the p state,
                     and we have

c. For the d state,  and we obtain

Significance

In the s state, there is no orbital angular momentum and therefore no magnetic moment. This does not mean
that the electron is at rest, just that the overall motion of the electron does not produce a magnetic field. In the
p state, the electron has a magnetic moment with three possible values for the z-component of this magnetic
moment; this means that magnetic moment can point in three different polar directions--each antiparallel to
the orbital angular momentum vector. In the d state, the electron has a magnetic moment with five possible
values for the z-component of this magnetic moment. In this case, the magnetic moment can point in five
360  8 · Atomic Structure

     different polar directions.

     A hydrogen atom has a magnetic field, so we expect the hydrogen atom to interact with an external magnetic
     field--such as the push and pull between two bar magnets. From Force and Torque on a Current Loop, we know
     that when a current loop interacts with an external magnetic field , it experiences a torque given by

                                                                                                                                                          8.22

     where I is the current, is the area of the loop, is the magnetic moment, and is the external magnetic field.
     This torque acts to rotate the magnetic moment vector of the hydrogen atom to align with the external
     magnetic field. Because mechanical work is done by the external magnetic field on the hydrogen atom, we can
     talk about energy transformations in the atom. The potential energy of the hydrogen atom associated with this
     magnetic interaction is given by Equation 8.23:

                                                                                                                                                          8.23

     If the magnetic moment is antiparallel to the external magnetic field, the potential energy is large, but if the
     magnetic moment is parallel to the field, the potential energy is small. Work done on the hydrogen atom to
     rotate the atom's magnetic moment vector in the direction of the external magnetic field is therefore
     associated with a drop in potential energy. The energy of the system is conserved, however, because a drop in
     potential energy produces radiation (the emission of a photon). These energy transitions are quantized
     because the magnetic moment can point in only certain directions.

     If the external magnetic field points in the positive z-direction, the potential energy associated with the orbital
     magnetic dipole moment is

                                                                                                                   8.24

     where is the Bohr magneton and m is the angular momentum projection quantum number (or magnetic
     orbital quantum number), which has the values

                                                                                                                   8.25

     For example, in the   electron state, the total energy of the electron is split into three distinct energy levels
     corresponding to

     The splitting of energy levels by an external magnetic field is called the Zeeman effect. Ignoring the effects of

     electron spin, transitions from the  state to a common lower energy state produce three closely spaced

     spectral lines (Figure 8.11, left column). Likewise, transitions from the  state produce five closely spaced

     spectral lines (right column). The separation of these lines is proportional to the strength of the external

     magnetic field. This effect has many applications. For example, the splitting of lines in the hydrogen spectrum

     of the Sun is used to determine the strength of the Sun's magnetic field. Many such magnetic field

     measurements can be used to make a map of the magnetic activity at the Sun's surface called a magnetogram

     (Figure 8.12).

In this section, we consider the effects of electron spin. Spin introduces two additional quantum numbers to
our model of the hydrogen atom. Both were discovered by looking at the fine structure of atomic spectra. Spin
362  8 · Atomic Structure

     is a fundamental characteristic of all particles, not just electrons, and is analogous to the intrinsic spin of
     extended bodies about their own axes, such as the daily rotation of Earth.

     Spin is quantized in the same manner as orbital angular momentum. It has been found that the magnitude of
     the intrinsic spin angular momentum S of an electron is given by

                                                                                                               8.26

     where s is defined to be the spin quantum number. This is similar to the quantization of L given in Equation

     8.4, except that the only value allowed for s for an electron is      The electron is said to be a "spin-half

     particle." The spin projection quantum number is associated with the z-components of spin, expressed by

     In general, the allowed quantum numbers are

                                                                                                               8.28

     Directions of intrinsic spin are quantized, just as they were for orbital angular momentum. The

     state is called the "spin-down" state and has a z-component of spin,  ;  state is called

     the "spin-up" state and has a z-component of spin,                These states are shown in Figure 8.13.

     number. In analogy to the orbital angular momentum, the magnitude of the electron magnetic moment is

The z-component of the magnetic moment is                                                              8.32

where is one Bohr magneton. An electron is magnetic, so we expect the electron to interact with other
magnetic fields. We consider two special cases: the interaction of a free electron with an external (nonuniform)
magnetic field, and an electron in a hydrogen atom with a magnetic field produced by the orbital angular
momentum of the electron.

EXAMPLE 8.4

Electron Spin and Radiation

A hydrogen atom in the ground state is placed in an external uniform magnetic field (  ). Determine

the frequency of radiation produced in a transition between the spin-up and spin-down states of the electron.

Strategy                                       , so the z-component of the magnetic moment is
The spin projection quantum number is

                                                                  

The potential energy associated with the interaction between the electron magnetic moment and the external
magnetic field is

The frequency of light emitted is proportional to the energy ( ) difference between these two states.

Solution                                       , so the frequency of radiation produced is
The energy difference between these states is

Significance
The electron magnetic moment couples with the external magnetic field. The energy of this system is different
whether the electron is aligned or not with the proton. The frequency of radiation produced by a transition
between these states is proportional to the energy difference. If we double the strength of the magnetic field,
holding all other things constant, the frequency of the radiation doubles and its wavelength is cut in half.

In a hydrogen atom, the electron magnetic moment can interact with the magnetic field produced by the
orbital angular momentum of the electron, a phenomenon called spin-orbit coupling. The orbital angular
momentum ( ), orbital magnetic moment ( ), spin angular momentum ( ), and spin magnetic moment ( )
vectors are shown together in Figure 8.14.

Just as the energy levels of a hydrogen atom can be split by an external magnetic field, so too are the energy
364  8 · Atomic Structure

     levels of a hydrogen atom split by internal magnetic fields of the atom. If the magnetic moment of the electron
     and orbital magnetic moment of the electron are antiparallel, the potential energy from the magnetic
     interaction is relatively high, but when these moments are parallel, the potential energy is relatively small.
     Transition from each of these two states to a lower-energy level results in the emission of a photon of slightly
     different frequency. That is, the spin-orbit coupling "splits" the spectral line expected from a spin-less
     electron. The fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum is explained by spin-orbit coupling.

        Figure 8.14 Spin-orbit coupling is the interaction of an electron's spin magnetic moment with its orbital magnetic moment .

     The Stern-Gerlach experiment provides experimental evidence that electrons have spin angular momentum.

     The experiment passes a stream of silver (Ag) atoms through an external, nonuniform magnetic field. The Ag

     atom has an orbital angular momentum of zero and contains a single unpaired electron in the outer shell.

     Therefore, the total angular momentum of the Ag atom is due entirely to the spin of the outer electron

     (  . Due to electron spin, the Ag atoms act as tiny magnets as they pass through the magnetic field. These

     "magnets" have two possible orientations, which correspond to the spin-up and -down states of the electron.

     The magnetic field diverts the spin up atoms in one direction and the spin-down atoms in another direction.

     This produces two distinct bands on a screen (Figure 8.15).

     Figure 8.15 In the Stern-Gerlach experiment, an external, nonuniform magnetic field diverts a beam of electrons in two different
     directions. This result is due to the quantization of spin angular momentum.

     According to classical predictions, the angular momentum (and, therefore, the magnetic moment) of the Ag
     atom can point in any direction, so one expects, instead, a continuous smudge on the screen. The resulting two
     bands of the Stern-Gerlach experiment provide startling support for the ideas of quantum mechanics.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 8.2

If the Stern-Gerlach experiment yielded four distinct bands instead of two, what might be concluded about the
spin quantum number of the charged particle?

Just like an electron, a proton is spin 1/2 and has a magnetic moment. (According to nuclear theory, this

moment is due to the orbital motion of quarks within the proton.) The hyperfine structure of the hydrogen

spectrum is explained by the interaction between the magnetic moment of the proton and the magnetic

moment of the electron, an interaction known as spin-spin coupling. The energy of the electron-proton system

is different depending on whether or not the moments are aligned. Transitions between these states (spin-flip

transitions) result in the emission of a photon with a wavelength of  (in the radio range). The 21-cm

line in atomic spectroscopy is a "fingerprint" of hydrogen gas. Astronomers exploit this spectral line to map

the spiral arms of galaxies, which are composed mostly of hydrogen (Figure 8.16).

Pinwheel Galaxy (NGC 5457). (a) The galaxy seen in visible light; (b) the galaxy seen in 21-cm hydrogen radiation; (c) the composite image
of (a) and (b). Notice how the hydrogen emission penetrates dust in the galaxy to show the spiral arms very clearly, whereas the galactic
nucleus shows up better in visible light (credit a: modification of work by ESA & NASA; credit b: modification of work by Fabian Walter).

A complete specification of the state of an electron in a hydrogen atom requires five quantum numbers: n, l, m,
s, and . The names, symbols, and allowed values of these quantum numbers are summarized in Table 8.4.

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Explain the importance of Pauli's exclusion principle to an understanding of atomic structure and molecular
           bonding

      · Explain the structure of the periodic table in terms of the total energy, orbital angular momentum, and spin of
           individual electrons in an atom

      · Describe the electron configuration of atoms in the periodic table

     So far, we have studied only hydrogen, the simplest chemical element. We have found that an electron in the
     hydrogen atom can be completely specified by five quantum numbers:

                                                                                                                   8.34

     To construct the ground state of a neutral multi-electron atom, imagine starting with a nucleus of charge Ze

     (that is, a nucleus of atomic number Z) and then adding Z electrons one by one. Assume that each electron

     moves in a spherically symmetrical electric field produced by the nucleus and all other electrons of the atom.

     The assumption is valid because the electrons are distributed randomly around the nucleus and produce an

     average electric field (and potential) that is spherically symmetrical. The electric potential U(r) for each

     electron does not follow the simple  form because of interactions between electrons, but it turns out that

     we can still label each individual electron state by quantum numbers,             . (The spin quantum

     number s is the same for all electrons, so it will not be used in this section.)

     The structure and chemical properties of atoms are explained in part by Pauli's exclusion principle: No two

     electrons in an atom can have the same values for all four quantum numbers        This principle is

     related to two properties of electrons: All electrons are identical ("when you've seen one electron, you've seen

     them all") and they have half-integral spin  Sample sets of quantum numbers for the electrons in an

     atom are given in Table 8.5. Consistent with Pauli's exclusion principle, no two rows of the table have the exact

     same set of quantum numbers.

Table 8.5 Electron States of Atoms Because of Pauli's exclusion principle, no two electrons in an atom have
the same set of four quantum numbers.

Electrons with the same principal quantum number n are said to be in the same shell, and those that have the

same value of l are said to occupy the same subshell. An electron in the                            state of a hydrogen atom is

denoted 1s, where the first digit indicates the shell  and the letter indicates the subshell

     the outer shell, whereas the symbol indicates a pair of spin-up and -down electrons in an outer shell.

     The maximum number of electrons in a subshell depends on the value of the angular momentum quantum

     number, l. For a given a value l, there are  orbital angular momentum states. However, each of these

     states can be filled by two electrons (spin up and down, ). Thus, the maximum number of electrons in a

     subshell is

                                                                                                              8.35

     In the 2s    subshell, the maximum number of electrons is 2. In the 2p ( ) subshell, the maximum

     number of electrons is 6. Therefore, the total maximum number of electrons in the  shell (including both

     the        and 1 subshells) is    or 8. In general, the maximum number of electrons in the nth shell is

Strategy

Subshells are determined by the value of l; thus, we first determine which values of l are allowed, and then we

apply the equation "maximum number of electrons that can be in a subshell                 " to find the number

of electrons in each subshell.

Solution

Because       we know that l can be 0, 1, or 2; thus, there are three possible subshells. In standard notation,

they are labeled the 3s, 3p, and 3d subshells. We have already seen that two electrons can be in an s state, and

six in a p state, but let us use the equation "maximum number of electrons that can be in a subshell

            " to calculate the maximum number in each:

The equation "maximum number of electrons that can be in a shell  " gives the maximum number in the
        shell to be

Significance

The total number of electrons in the three possible subshells is thus the same as the formula . In standard

(spectroscopic) notation, a filled  shell is denoted as           . Shells do not fill in a simple manner.

Before the    shell is completely filled, for example, we begin to find electrons in the  shell.

The structure of the periodic table (Figure 8.17) can be understood in terms of shells and subshells, and,
ultimately, the total energy, orbital angular momentum, and spin of the electrons in the atom. A detailed
discussion of the periodic table is left to a chemistry course--we sketch only its basic features here. In this
discussion, we assume that the atoms are electrically neutral; that is, they have the same number of electrons
and protons. (Recall that the total number of protons in an atomic nucleus is called the atomic number, Z.)

First, the periodic table is arranged into columns and rows. The table is read left to right and top to bottom in
the order of increasing atomic number Z. Atoms that belong to the same column or chemical group share
many of the same chemical properties. For example, the Li and Na atoms (in the first column) bond to other
atoms in a similar way. The first row of the table corresponds to the 1s ( ) shell of an atom.

Consider the hypothetical procedure of adding electrons, one by one, to an atom. For hydrogen (H) (upper left),

the 1s shell is filled with either a spin up or down electron (  ). This lone electron is easily shared with

other atoms, so hydrogen is chemically active. For helium (He) (upper right), the 1s shell is filled with both a

spin up and a spin down ( ) electron. This "fills" the 1s shell, so a helium atom tends not to share electrons

with other atoms. The helium atom is said to be chemically inactive, inert, or noble; likewise, helium gas is said

to be an inert gas or noble gas.

                           Figure 8.17 The periodic table of elements, showing the structure of shells and subshells.

     The second row corresponds to the 2s and 2p subshells. For lithium (Li) (upper left), the 1s shell is filled with a

     spin-up and spin-down electron ( ) and the 2s shell is filled with either a spin-up or -down electron (                           ).

     Its electron configuration is therefore       or [He]2s, where [He] indicates a helium core. Like hydrogen, the

     lone electron in the outermost shell is easily shared with other atoms. For beryllium (Be), the 2s shell is filled

     with a spin-up and -down electron ( ), and has the electron configuration [He] .

     Next, we look at the right side of the table. For boron (B), the 1s and 2s shells are filled and the 2p ( ) shell

     contains either a spin up or down electron (     ). From carbon (C) to neon (N), we the fill the 2p shell. The

     maximum number of electrons in the 2p shells is                     . For neon (Ne), the 1s shell is filled

     with a spin-up and spin-down electron ( ), and the 2p shell is filled with six electrons (                        . This "fills"

     the 1s, 2s, and 2p subshells, so like helium, the neon atom tends not to share electrons with other atoms.

     The process of electron filling repeats in the third row. However, beginning in the fourth row, the pattern is
     broken. The actual order of order of electron filling is given by

     1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s,...

     Notice that the 3d, 4d, 4f, and 5d subshells (in bold) are filled out of order; this occurs because of interactions

     between electrons in the atom, which so far we have neglected. The transition metals are elements in the gap

     between the first two columns and the last six columns that contain electrons that fill the d ( ) subshell. As

     expected, these atoms are arranged in                               columns. The structure of the periodic table can

     be understood in terms of the quantization of the total energy (n), orbital angular momentum (l), and spin (s).

     The first two columns correspond to the s     ) subshell, the next six columns correspond to the p ( )

     subshell, and the gap between these columns corresponds to the d ( ) subshell.

The periodic table also gives information on molecular bonding. To see this, consider atoms in the left-most
column (the so-called alkali metals including: Li, Na, and K). These atoms contain a single electron in the 2s
subshell, which is easily donated to other atoms. In contrast, atoms in the second-to-right column (the
halogens: for example, Cl, F, and Br) are relatively stingy in sharing electrons. These atoms would much rather
accept an electron, because they are just one electron shy of a filled shell ("of being noble").

Therefore, if a Na atom is placed in close proximity to a Cl atom, the Na atom freely donates its 2s electron and

the Cl atom eagerly accepts it. In the process, the Na atom (originally a neutral charge) becomes positively

charged and the Cl (originally a neutral charge) becomes negatively charged. Charged atoms are called ions. In

this case, the ions are  and , where the superscript indicates charge of the ion. The electric (Coulomb)

attraction between these atoms forms a NaCl (salt) molecule. A chemical bond between two ions is called an

ionic bond. There are many kinds of chemical bonds. For example, in an oxygen molecule electrons are

equally shared between the atoms. The bonding of oxygen atoms is an example of a covalent bond.

8.5 Atomic Spectra and X-rays

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Describe the absorption and emission of radiation in terms of atomic energy levels and energy differences
 · Use quantum numbers to estimate the energy, frequency, and wavelength of photons produced by atomic

      transitions in multi-electron atoms
 · Explain radiation concepts in the context of atomic fluorescence and X-rays

The study of atomic spectra provides most of our knowledge about atoms. In modern science, atomic spectra
are used to identify species of atoms in a range of objects, from distant galaxies to blood samples at a crime
scene.

The theoretical basis of atomic spectroscopy is the transition of electrons between energy levels in atoms. For

example, if an electron in a hydrogen atom makes a transition from the     to the  shell, the atom emits

a photon with a wavelength

                                                                                                            8.36

where                    is energy carried away by the photon and          . After this radiation passes

through a spectrometer, it appears as a sharp spectral line on a screen. The Bohr model of this process is

shown in Figure 8.18. If the electron later absorbs a photon with energy , the electron returns to the

shell. (We examined the Bohr model earlier, in Photons and Matter Waves.)
372  8 · Atomic Structure

                           Figure 8.18 An electron transition from the  to the  shell of a hydrogen atom.

     To understand atomic transitions in multi-electron atoms, it is necessary to consider many effects, including

     the Coulomb repulsion between electrons and internal magnetic interactions (spin-orbit and spin-spin

     couplings). Fortunately, many properties of these systems can be understood by neglecting interactions

     between electrons and representing each electron by its own single-particle wave function             .

     Atomic transitions must obey selection rules. These rules follow from principles of quantum mechanics and
     symmetry. Selection rules classify transitions as either allowed or forbidden. (Forbidden transitions do occur,
     but the probability of the typical forbidden transition is very small.) For a hydrogen-like atom, atomic
     transitions that involve electromagnetic interactions (the emission and absorption of photons) obey the
     following selection rule:

                                                                                                              8.37

     where l is associated with the magnitude of orbital angular momentum,                                    8.38

                                                                         

     For multi-electron atoms, similar rules apply. To illustrate this rule, consider the observed atomic transitions
     in hydrogen (H), sodium (Na), and mercury (Hg) (Figure 8.19). The horizontal lines in this diagram correspond
     to atomic energy levels, and the transitions allowed by this selection rule are shown by lines drawn between
     these levels. The energies of these states are on the order of a few electron volts, and photons emitted in
     transitions are in the visible range. Technically, atomic transitions can violate the selection rule, but such
     transitions are uncommon.

Figure 8.19 Energy-level diagrams for (a) hydrogen, (b) sodium, and (c) mercury. For comparison, hydrogen energy levels are shown in
the sodium diagram.

The hydrogen atom has the simplest energy-level diagram. If we neglect electron spin, all states with the same

value of n have the same total energy. However, spin-orbit coupling splits the  states into two angular

momentum states (s and p) of slightly different energies. (These levels are not vertically displaced, because the

energy splitting is too small to show up in this diagram.) Likewise, spin-orbit coupling splits the  states

into three angular momentum states (s, p, and d).
374  8 · Atomic Structure

     The energy-level diagram for hydrogen is similar to sodium, because both atoms have one electron in the outer
     shell. The valence electron of sodium moves in the electric field of a nucleus shielded by electrons in the inner
     shells, so it does not experience a simple 1/r Coulomb potential and its total energy depends on both n and l.
     Interestingly, mercury has two separate energy-level diagrams; these diagrams correspond to two net spin
     states of its 6s (valence) electrons.

             EXAMPLE 8.6

     The Sodium Doublet

     The spectrum of sodium is analyzed with a spectrometer. Two closely spaced lines with wavelengths 589.00
     nm and 589.59 nm are observed. (a) If the doublet corresponds to the excited (valence) electron that
     transitions from some excited state down to the 3s state, what was the original electron angular momentum?
     (b) What is the energy difference between these two excited states?

     Strategy
     Sodium and hydrogen belong to the same column or chemical group of the periodic table, so sodium is
     "hydrogen-like." The outermost electron in sodium is in the 3s ( ) subshell and can be excited to higher
     energy levels. As for hydrogen, subsequent transitions to lower energy levels must obey the selection rule:

     We must first determine the quantum number of the initial state that satisfies the selection rule. Then, we can
     use this number to determine the magnitude of orbital angular momentum of the initial state.

     Solution

     a. Allowed transitions must obey the selection rule. If the quantum number of the initial state is  , the

     transition is forbidden because   . If the quantum number of the initial state is                   ,...the

     transition is forbidden because   Therefore, the quantum of the initial state must be               . The

     orbital angular momentum of the initial state is

                                                         

     b. Because the final state for both transitions is the same (3s), the difference in energies of the photons is
          equal to the difference in energies of the two excited states. Using the equation

     we have

     Significance
     To understand the difficulty of measuring this energy difference, we compare this difference with the average
     energy of the two photons emitted in the transition. Given an average wavelength of 589.30 nm, the average
     energy of the photons is

     The energy difference is about 0.1% (1 part in 1000) of this average energy. However, a sensitive
     spectrometer can measure the difference.

Atomic Fluorescence

Fluorescence occurs when an electron in an atom is excited several steps above the ground state by the
absorption of a high-energy ultraviolet (UV) photon. Once excited, the electron "de-excites" in two ways. The
electron can drop back to the ground state, emitting a photon of the same energy that excited it, or it can drop
in a series of smaller steps, emitting several low-energy photons. Some of these photons may be in the visible
range. Fluorescent dye in clothes can make colors seem brighter in sunlight by converting UV radiation into
visible light. Fluorescent lights are more efficient in converting electrical energy into visible light than
incandescent filaments (about four times as efficient). Figure 8.20 shows a scorpion illuminated by a UV lamp.
Proteins near the surface of the skin emit a characteristic blue light.

                                            Figure 8.20 A scorpion glows blue under a UV lamp. (credit: Ken Bosma)

X-rays

The study of atomic energy transitions enables us to understand X-rays and X-ray technology. Like all
electromagnetic radiation, X-rays are made of photons. X-ray photons are produced when electrons in the
outermost shells of an atom drop to the inner shells. (Hydrogen atoms do not emit X-rays, because the electron
energy levels are too closely spaced together to permit the emission of high-frequency radiation.) Transitions
of this kind are normally forbidden because the lower states are already filled. However, if an inner shell has a
vacancy (an inner electron is missing, perhaps from being knocked away by a high-speed electron), an
electron from one of the outer shells can drop in energy to fill the vacancy. The energy gap for such a transition
is relatively large, so wavelength of the radiated X-ray photon is relatively short.

X-rays can also be produced by bombarding a metal target with high-energy electrons, as shown in Figure
8.21. In the figure, electrons are boiled off a filament and accelerated by an electric field into a tungsten target.
According to the classical theory of electromagnetism, any charged particle that accelerates emits radiation.
Thus, when the electron strikes the tungsten target, and suddenly slows down, the electron emits braking
radiation. (Braking radiation refers to radiation produced by any charged particle that is slowed by a medium.)
In this case, braking radiation contains a continuous range of frequencies, because the electrons will collide
with the target atoms in slightly different ways.

Braking radiation is not the only type of radiation produced in this interaction. In some cases, an electron
collides with another inner-shell electron of a target atom, and knocks the electron out of the atom--billiard
ball style. The empty state is filled when an electron in a higher shell drops into the state (drop in energy level)
and emits an X-ray photon.

                           Figure 8.21 A sketch of an X-ray tube. X-rays are emitted from the tungsten target.

     Historically, X-ray spectral lines were labeled with letters (K, L, M, N, ...). These letters correspond to the atomic

     shells (                 ). X-rays produced by a transition from any higher shell to the K (               ) shell are labeled

     as K X-rays. X-rays produced in a transition from the L (  ) shell are called X-rays; X-rays produced in a

     transition from the M (  ) shell are called X-rays; X-rays produced in a transition from the N (           )

     shell are called X-rays; and so forth. Transitions from higher shells to L and M shells are labeled similarly.

     These transitions are represented by an energy-level diagram in Figure 8.22.

     The distribution of X-ray wavelengths produced by striking metal with a beam of electrons is given in Figure
     8.23. X-ray transitions in the target metal appear as peaks on top of the braking radiation curve. Photon
     frequencies corresponding to the spikes in the X-ray distribution are called characteristic frequencies,
     because they can be used to identify the target metal. The sharp cutoff wavelength (just below the peak)
     corresponds to an electron that loses all of its energy to a single photon. Radiation of shorter wavelengths is
     forbidden by the conservation of energy.

X-Rays from Aluminum

Estimate the characteristic energy and frequency of the X-ray for aluminum (            ).

Strategy

A X-ray is produced by the transition of an electron in the L (  ) shell to the K (         ) shell. An electron

in the L shell "sees" a charge  because one electron in the K shell shields the nuclear charge.

(Recall, two electrons are not in the K shell because the other electron state is vacant.) The frequency of the

emitted photon can be estimated from the energy difference between the L and K shells.

Solution

The energy difference between the L and K shells in a hydrogen atom is 10.2 eV. Assuming that other electrons

in the L shell or in higher-energy shells do not shield the nuclear charge, the energy difference between the L

and K shells in an atom with    is approximately

                                                                                            8.39

Based on the relationship       , the frequency of the X-ray is

Significance
The wavelength of the typical X-ray is 0.1-10 nm. In this case, the wavelength is:

Hence, the transition L K in aluminum produces X-ray radiation.

X-ray production provides an important test of quantum mechanics. According to the Bohr model, the energy
of a X-ray depends on the nuclear charge or atomic number, Z. If Z is large, Coulomb forces in the atom are
large, energy differences ( ) are large, and, therefore, the energy of radiated photons is large. To illustrate,
consider a single electron in a multi-electron atom. Neglecting interactions between the electrons, the allowed
energy levels are

                                                                                                                                                     8.40

     where n = 1, 2, ...and Z is the atomic number of the nucleus. However, an electron in the L (     ) shell "sees" a

     charge  , because one electron in the K shell shields the nuclear charge. (Recall that there is only one

     electron in the K shell because the other electron was "knocked out.") Therefore, the approximate energies of

     the electron in the L and K shells are

     The energy carried away by a photon in a transition from the L shell to the K shell is therefore

     shell is

     where f is the frequency of a     X-ray. This equation is Moseley's law. For large values of Z, we have
     approximately

     This prediction can be checked by measuring f for a variety of metal targets. This model is supported if a plot
     of Z versus data (called a Moseley plot) is linear. Comparison of model predictions and experimental
     results, for both the K and L series, is shown in Figure 8.24. The data support the model that X-rays are

Two electrons occupy a filled K shell. A vacancy in this shell would leave one electron, so the effective charge

for an electron in the L shell would be Z - 1 rather than Z. For tungsten,  so the effective charge is 73.

This number can be used to calculate the energy-level difference between the L and K shells, and, therefore,

the energy carried away by a photon in the transition

     Significance
     This large photon energy is typical of X-rays. X-ray energies become progressively larger for heavier elements
     because their energy increases approximately as . An acceleration voltage of more than 50,000 volts is
     needed to "knock out" an inner electron from a tungsten atom.

     X-ray Technology

     X-rays have many applications, such as in medical diagnostics (Figure 8.25), inspection of luggage at airports
     (Figure 8.26), and even detection of cracks in crucial aircraft components. The most common X-ray images are
     due to shadows. Because X-ray photons have high energy, they penetrate materials that are opaque to visible
     light. The more energy an X-ray photon has, the more material it penetrates. The depth of penetration is
     related to the density of the material, as well as to the energy of the photon. The denser the material, the fewer
     X-ray photons get through and the darker the shadow. X-rays are effective at identifying bone breaks and
     tumors; however, overexposure to X-rays can damage cells in biological organisms.

view does not often provide enough information to draw firm conclusions. For example, in a two-dimensional
X-ray image of the body, bones can easily hide soft tissues or organs. The CAT (computed axial tomography)
scanner addresses this problem by collecting numerous X-ray images in "slices" throughout the body.
Complex computer-image processing of the relative absorption of the X-rays, in different directions, can
produce a highly detailed three-dimensional X-ray image of the body.

X-rays can also be used to probe the structures of atoms and molecules. Consider X-rays incident on the
surface of a crystalline solid. Some X-ray photons reflect at the surface, and others reflect off the "plane" of
atoms just below the surface. Interference between these photons, for different angles of incidence, produces a
beautiful image on a screen (Figure 8.27). The interaction of X-rays with a solid is called X-ray diffraction. The
most famous example using X-ray diffraction is the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA.

Figure 8.27 X-ray diffraction from the crystal of a protein (hen egg lysozyme) produced this interference pattern. Analysis of the pattern
yields information about the structure of the protein. (credit: "Del45"/Wikimedia Commons)

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Describe the physical processes necessary to produce laser light
 · Explain the difference between coherent and incoherent light
 · Describe the application of lasers to a CD and Blu-Ray player

A laser is device that emits coherent and monochromatic light. The light is coherent if photons that compose
the light are in-phase, and monochromatic if the photons have a single frequency (color). When a gas in the
laser absorbs radiation, electrons are elevated to different energy levels. Most electrons return immediately to
the ground state, but others linger in what is called a metastable state. It is possible to place a majority of these
382  8 · Atomic Structure

     atoms in a metastable state, a condition called a population inversion.

     When a photon of energy disturbs an electron in a metastable state (Figure 8.28), the electron drops to the

     lower-energy level and emits an addition photon, and the two photons proceed off together. This process is

     called stimulated emission. It occurs with relatively high probability when the energy of the incoming photon

     is equal to the energy difference between the excited and "de-excited" energy levels of the electron (              ).

     Hence, the incoming photon and the photon produced by de-excitation have the same energy, hf. These

     photons encounter more electrons in the metastable state, and the process repeats. The result is a cascade or

     chain reaction of similar de-excitations. Laser light is coherent because all light waves in laser light share the

     same frequency (color) and the same phase (any two points of along a line perpendicular to the direction of

     motion are on the "same part" of the wave"). A schematic diagram of coherent and incoherent light wave

     pattern is given in Figure 8.29.

                Figure 8.28 The physics of a laser. An incident photon of frequency f causes a cascade of photons of the same frequency.

     Figure 8.29 A coherent light wave pattern contains light waves of the same frequency and phase. An incoherent light wave pattern
     contains light waves of different frequencies and phases.

     Lasers are used in a wide range of applications, such as in communication (optical fiber phone lines),
     entertainment (laser light shows), medicine (removing tumors and cauterizing vessels in the retina), and in
     retail sales (bar code readers). Lasers can also be produced by a large range of materials, including solids (for
     example, the ruby crystal), gases (helium-gas mixture), and liquids (organic dyes). Recently, a laser was even
     created using gelatin--an edible laser! Below we discuss two practical applications in detail: CD players and
     Blu-Ray Players.

     CD Player

     A CD player reads digital information stored on a compact disc (CD). A CD is 6-inch diameter disc made of
     plastic that contains small "bumps" and "pits" nears its surface to encode digital or binary data (Figure 8.30).
     The bumps and pits appear along a very thin track that spirals outwards from the center of the disc. The width
     of the track is smaller than 1/20th the width of a human hair, and the heights of the bumps are even smaller
     yet.

                                                                  8.6 · Lasers                                                        383

Figure 8.30 A compact disc is a plastic disc that uses bumps near its surface to encode digital information. The surface of the disc
contains multiple layers, including a layer of aluminum and one of polycarbonate plastic.

A CD player uses a laser to read this digital information. Laser light is suited to this purpose, because coherent
light can be focused onto an incredibly small spot and therefore distinguish between bumps and pits in the CD.
After processing by player components (including a diffraction grating, polarizer, and collimator), laser light is
focused by a lens onto the CD surface. Light that strikes a bump ("land") is merely reflected, but light that
strikes a "pit" destructively interferes, so no light returns (the details of this process are not important to this
discussion). Reflected light is interpreted as a "1" and unreflected light is interpreted as a "0." The resulting
digital signal is converted into an analog signal, and the analog signal is fed into an amplifier that powers a
device such as a pair of headphones. The laser system of a CD player is shown in Figure 8.31.

                Figure 8.31 A CD player and its laser component.

Blu-Ray Player

Like a CD player, a Blu-Ray player reads digital information (video or audio) stored on a disc, and a laser is used

to record this information. The pits on a Blu-Ray disc are much smaller and more closely packed together than

for a CD, so much more information can be stored. As a result, the resolving power of the laser must be greater.

This is achieved using short wavelength  blue laser light--hence, the name "Blu-" Ray. (CDs and

DVDs use red laser light.) The different pit sizes and player-hardware configurations of a CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray

player are shown in Figure 8.32. The pit sizes of a Blu-Ray disk are more than twice as small as the pits on a

DVD or CD. Unlike a CD, a Blu-Ray disc store data on a polycarbonate layer, which places the data closer to the

lens and avoids readability problems. A hard coating is used to protect the data since it is so close to the

surface.

INTRODUCTION In this chapter, we examine applications of quantum mechanics to more complex systems,
such as molecules, metals, semiconductors, and superconductors. We review and develop concepts of the
previous chapters, including wave functions, orbitals, and quantum states. We also introduce many new
concepts, including covalent bonding, rotational energy levels, Fermi energy, energy bands, doping, and
Cooper pairs.
The main topic in this chapter is the crystal structure of solids. For centuries, crystalline solids have been
prized for their beauty, including gems like diamonds and emeralds, as well as geological crystals of quartz
and metallic ores. But the crystalline structures of semiconductors such as silicon have also made possible the
electronics industry of today. In this chapter, we study how the structures of solids give them properties from
strength and transparency to electrical conductivity.

     9.1 Types of Molecular Bonds

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Distinguish between the different types of molecular bonds
      · Determine the dissociation energy of a molecule using the concepts ionization energy, electron affinity, and

           Coulomb force
      · Describe covalent bonding in terms of exchange symmetry
      · Explain the physical structure of a molecule in terms of the concept of hybridization

     Quantum mechanics has been extraordinarily successful at explaining the structure and bonding in

     molecules, and is therefore the foundation for all of chemistry. Quantum chemistry, as it is sometimes called,

     explains such basic questions as why  molecules exist, why the bonding angle between hydrogen atoms in

     this molecule is precisely        , and why these molecules bind together to form liquid water at room

     temperature. Applying quantum mechanics to molecules can be very difficult mathematically, so our

     discussion will be qualitative only.

     As we study molecules and then solids, we will use many different scientific models. In some cases, we look at
     a molecule or crystal as a set of point nuclei with electrons whizzing around the outside in well-defined
     trajectories, as in the Bohr model. In other cases, we employ our full knowledge of quantum mechanics to
     study these systems using wave functions and the concept of electron spin. It is important to remember that
     we study modern physics with models, and that different models are useful for different purposes. We do not
     always use the most powerful model, when a less-powerful, easier-to-use model will do the job.

     Types of Bonds

     Chemical units form by many different kinds of chemical bonds. An ionic bond forms when an electron
     transfers from one atom to another. A covalent bond occurs when two or more atoms share electrons. A van
     der Waals bond occurs due to the attraction of charge-polarized molecules and is considerably weaker than
     ionic or covalent bonds. Many other types of bonding exist as well. Often, bonding occurs via more than one
     mechanism. The focus of this section is ionic and covalent bonding.

     Ionic bonds

     The ionic bond is perhaps the easiest type of bonding to understand. It explains the formation of salt
     compounds, such as sodium chloride, NaCl. The sodium atom (symbol Na) has the same electron arrangement
     as a neon atom plus one 3s electron. Only 5.14 eV of energy is required to remove this one electron from the
     sodium atom. Therefore, Na can easily give up or donate this electron to an adjacent (nearby) atom, attaining a
     more stable arrangement of electrons. Chlorine (symbol Cl) requires just one electron to complete its valence
     shell, so it readily accepts this electron if it is near the sodium atom. We therefore say that chlorine has a large
     electron affinity, which is the energy associated with an accepted electron. The energy given up by the
     chlorine atom in this process is 3.62 eV. After the electron transfers from the sodium atom to the chlorine
     atom, the sodium atom becomes a positive ion and the chlorine atom becomes a negative ion. The total energy
     required for this transfer is given by

     The positive sodium ion and negative chloride ion experience an attractive Coulomb force. The potential
     energy associated with this force is given by

                                                                                                              9.1

     where                             and is the distance between the ions.

     As the sodium and chloride ions move together ("descend the potential energy hill"), the force of attraction
     between the ions becomes stronger. However, if the ions become too close, core-electron wave functions in the
     two ions begin to overlap. Due to the exclusion principle, this action promotes the core electrons--and

therefore the entire molecule--into a higher energy state. The equilibrium separation distance (or bond
length) between the ions occurs when the molecule is in its lowest energy state. For diatomic NaCl, this
distance is 0.236 nm. Figure 9.2 shows the total energy of NaCl as a function of the distance of separation
between ions.

principle. The value of  must be negative for the bond to form spontaneously. The dissociation energy is

defined as the energy required to separate the unit into its constituent ions, written

     EXAMPLE 9.1

     The Energy of Salt

     What is the dissociation energy of a salt formula unit (NaCl)?

     Strategy

     Sodium chloride (NaCl) is a salt formed by ionic bonds. The energy change associated with this bond depends

     on three main processes: the ionization of Na; the acceptance of the electron from a Na atom by a Cl atom; and

     Coulomb attraction of the resulting ions (              ). If the ions get too close, they repel due to the exclusion

     principle (0.32 eV). The equilibrium separation distance is

     Solution

     The energy change associated with the transfer of an electron from Na to Cl is 1.52 eV, as discussed earlier in

     this section. At equilibrium separation, the atoms are          apart. The electrostatic potential energy

     of the atoms is

     The total energy difference associated with the formation of a NaCl formula unit is

     Therefore, the dissociated energy of NaCl is 4.26 eV.

     Significance

     The formation of a NaCl formula unit by ionic bonding is energetically favorable. The dissociation energy, or

     energy required to separate the NaCl unit into               ions is 4.26 eV, consistent with Figure 9.2.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 9.1

Why is the potential energy associated with the exclusion principle positive in Example 9.1?

For a sodium ion in an ionic NaCl crystal, the expression for Coulomb potential energy        must be modified

by a factor known as the Madelung constant. This factor takes into account the interaction of the sodium ion

with all nearby chloride and sodium ions. The Madelung constant for a NaCl crystal is about 1.75. This value

implies an equilibrium separation distance between        ions of 0.280 nm--slightly larger than for

diatomic NaCl. We will return to this point again later.

Covalent bonds

In an ionic bond, an electron transfers from one atom to another. However, in a covalent bond, an electron is
shared between two atoms. The ionic bonding mechanism cannot explain the existence of such molecules as

           and CO, since no separation distance exists for which the negative potential energy of attraction is
greater in magnitude than the energy needed to create ions. Understanding precisely how such molecules are
covalently bonded relies on a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics that goes beyond the coverage of
this book, but we will qualitatively describe the mechanisms in the following section.

Covalent bonds can be understood using the simple example of a molecule, which consists of one electron
in the electric field of two protons. This system can be modeled by an electron in a double square well (Figure
9.3). The electron is equally likely to be found in each well, so the wave function is either symmetric or
antisymmetric about a point midway between the wells.

Figure 9.3 A one-dimensional model of covalent bonding in a molecule. (a) The symmetric wave function of the electron shared by
the two positively charged protons (represented by the two finite square wells). (b) The corresponding antisymmetric wave function.

Now imagine that the two wells are separated by a large distance. In the ground state, the wave function exists
in one of two possible states: either a single positive peak (a sine wave-like "hump") in both wells (symmetric
case), or a positive peak in one well and a negative peak in the other (antisymmetric case). These states have
the same energy. However, when the wells are brought together, the symmetric wave function becomes the
ground state and the antisymmetric state becomes the first excited state--in other words, the energy level of
the electron is split. Notice, the space-symmetric state becomes the energetically favorable (lower energy)
state.

The same analysis is appropriate for an electron bound to two hydrogen atoms. Here, the shapes of the ground-

state wave functions have the form  or                    in one dimension. The energetically favorable, space-

symmetric state implies a high charge density midway between the protons where the electrons are likely to

pull the positively charged protons together.

If a second electron is added to this system to form a molecule, the wave function must describe both
particles, including their spatial relationship and relative spins. This wave function must also respect the
indistinguishability of electrons. ("If you've seen one electron, you've seen them all.") In particular, switching
or exchanging the electrons should not produce an observable effect, a property called exchange symmetry.
Exchange symmetry can be symmetric, producing no change in the wave function, or antisymmetric,
producing an overall change in the sign of the wave function--neither of which is observable.

As we discuss later, the total wave function of two electrons must be antisymmetric on exchange. For example,
398  9 · Condensed Matter Physics

     two electrons bound to a hydrogen molecule can be in a space-symmetric state with antiparallel spins or
     space-antisymmetric state with parallel spins . The state with antiparallel spins is energetically favorable
     and therefore used in covalent bonding. If the protons are drawn too closely together, however, repulsion
     between the protons becomes important. (In other molecules, this effect is supplied by the exclusion
     principle.) As a result, reaches an equilibrium separation of about 0.074 nm with a binding energy is 4.52
     eV.

     explore the attractive and repulsive forces that act on atomic particles and covalent bonding in a molecule.

     Quantum mechanics excludes many types of molecules. For example, the molecule does not form, because
     if a third H atom approaches diatomic hydrogen, the wave function of the electron in this atom overlaps the
     electrons in the other two atoms. If all three electrons are in the ground states of their respective atoms, one
     pair of electrons shares all the same quantum numbers, which is forbidden by the exclusion principle. Instead,
     one of the electrons is forced into a higher energy state. No separation between three protons exists for which
     the total energy change of this process is negative--that is, where bonding occurs spontaneously. Similarly,

           is not covalently bonded under normal conditions, because these atoms have no valence electrons to
     share. As the atoms are brought together, the wave functions of the core electrons overlap, and due to the
     exclusion principle, the electrons are forced into a higher energy state. No separation exists for which such a
     molecule is energetically favorable.

     Bonding in Polyatomic Molecules

     A polyatomic molecule is a molecule made of more than two atoms. Examples range from a simple water
     molecule to a complex protein molecule. The structures of these molecules can often be understood in terms
     of covalent bonding and hybridization. Hybridization is a change in the energy structure of an atom in which
     mixed states (states that can be written as a linear superposition of others) participate in bonding.

     To illustrate hybridization, consider the bonding in a simple water molecule,      The electron configuration

     of oxygen is  The 1s and 2s electrons are in "closed shells" and do not participate in bonding. The

     remaining four electrons are the valence electrons. These electrons can fill six possible states ( ,                              ,

     , plus spin up and down). The energies of these states are the same, so the oxygen atom can exploit any

     linear combination of these states in bonding with the hydrogen atoms. These linear combinations (which you

     learned about in the chapter on atomic structure) are called atomic orbitals, and they are denoted by

     and The electron charge distributions for these orbitals are given in Figure 9.4.

     Figure 9.4 Oxygen has four valence electrons. In the context of a water molecule, two valence electrons fill the orbital and one
     electron fills each of the and orbitals. The and orbitals are used in bonding with hydrogen atoms to form . Without
     repulsion of H atoms, the bond angle between hydrogen atoms would be 90 degrees.

     The transformation of the electron wave functions of oxygen to  and orbitals in the presence of the

     hydrogen atoms is an example of hybridization. Two electrons are found in the orbital with paired spins

     . One electron is found in each of the and orbitals, with unpaired spins. The latter orbitals participate

     in bonding with the hydrogen atoms. Based on Figure 9.4, we expect the bonding angle for               to be .

However, if we include the effects of repulsion between atoms, the bond angle is            . The same arguments

can be used to understand the tetrahedral shape of methane  and other molecules.

9.2 Molecular Spectra

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Use the concepts of vibrational and rotational energy to describe energy transitions in a diatomic molecule
 · Explain key features of a vibrational-rotational energy spectrum of a diatomic molecule
 · Estimate allowed energies of a rotating molecule
 · Determine the equilibrium separation distance between atoms in a diatomic molecule from the vibrational-

      rotational absorption spectrum

Molecular energy levels are more complicated than atomic energy levels because molecules can also vibrate

and rotate. The energies associated with such motions lie in different ranges and can therefore be studied

separately. Electronic transitions are of order 1 eV, vibrational transitions are of order   and rotational

transitions are of order  For complex molecules, these energy changes are difficult to characterize, so

we begin with the simple case of a diatomic molecule.

According to classical mechanics, the energy of rotation of a diatomic molecule is given by

                                                                                                            9.4

where I is the moment of inertia and L is the angular momentum. According to quantum mechanics, the
rotational angular momentum is quantized:

                                                                                                            9.5

where l is the orbital angular quantum number. The allowed rotational energy level of a diatomic molecule is
therefore

                           9.6

where the characteristic rotational energy of a molecule is defined as

                                                                9.7

For a diatomic molecule, the moment of inertia with reduced mass is

                                                                                                                                                       9.8

where is the total distance between the atoms. The energy difference between rotational levels is therefore
                                                                                                                                                       9.9

A detailed study of transitions between rotational energy levels brought about by the absorption or emission of
radiation (a so-called electric dipole transition) requires that

                                                                                                                                                     9.10

This rule, known as a selection rule, limits the possible transitions from one quantum state to another.
Equation 9.10 is the selection rule for rotational energy transitions. It applies only to diatomic molecules that
have an electric dipole moment. For this reason, symmetric molecules such as and do not experience
rotational energy transitions due to the absorption or emission of electromagnetic radiation.

     EXAMPLE 9.2

     The Rotational Energy of HCl

     Determine the lowest three rotational energy levels of a hydrogen chloride (HCl) molecule.

     Strategy

     Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a diatomic molecule with an equilibrium separation distance of 0.127 nm.

     Rotational energy levels depend only on the momentum of inertia I and the orbital angular momentum

     quantum number l (in this case,   , 1, and 2). The momentum of inertia depends, in turn, on the

     equilibrium separation distance (which is given) and the reduced mass, which depends on the masses of the H

     and Cl atoms.

     Solution
     First, we compute the reduced mass. If Particle 1 is hydrogen and Particle 2 is chloride, we have

     The corresponding rest mass energy is therefore

     This allows us to calculate the characteristic energy:

                                       

     (Notice how this expression is written in terms of the rest mass energy. This technique is common in modern
     physics calculations.) The rotational energy levels are given by

                                                                

     where l is the orbital quantum number. The three lowest rotational energy levels of an HCl molecule are
     therefore

     Significance

     The rotational spectrum is associated with weak transitions (1/1000 to 1/100 of an eV). By comparison, the

     energy of an electron in the ground state of hydrogen is  .

     What does the energy separation between absorption lines in a rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule tell
     you?

     The vibrational energy level, which is the energy level associated with the vibrational energy of a molecule, is
     more difficult to estimate than the rotational energy level. However, we can estimate these levels by assuming
     that the two atoms in the diatomic molecule are connected by an ideal spring of spring constant k. The

Where is a change in the "natural length" of the molecule along a line that connects the atoms. Solving
Schrödinger's equation for this potential gives

                                                                                                            9.12

Where is the natural angular frequency of vibration and n is the vibrational quantum number. The

prediction that vibrational energy levels are evenly spaced        turns out to be good at lower energies.

A detailed study of transitions between vibrational energy levels induced by the absorption or emission of
radiation (and the specifically so-called electric dipole transition) requires that

                                                                                                            9.13

Equation 9.13 represents the selection rule for vibrational energy transitions. As mentioned before, this rule
applies only to diatomic molecules that have an electric dipole moment. Symmetric molecules do not
experience such transitions.

Due to the selection rules, the absorption or emission of radiation by a diatomic molecule involves a transition

in vibrational and rotational states. Specifically, if the vibrational quantum number (n) changes by one unit,

then the rotational quantum number (l) changes by one unit. An energy-level diagram of a possible transition

is given in Figure 9.5. The absorption spectrum for such transitions in hydrogen chloride (HCl) is shown in

Figure 9.6. The absorption peaks are due to transitions from the            to  vibrational states. Energy

differences for the band of peaks at the left and right are, respectively,

                                                                                and

                                                 

The moment of inertia can then be determined from the energy spacing between individual peaks               or

from the gap between the left and right bands    . The frequency at the center of this gap is the frequency

of vibration.

     9.3 Bonding in Crystalline Solids

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe the packing structures of common solids
      · Explain the difference between bonding in a solid and in a molecule
      · Determine the equilibrium separation distance given crystal properties
      · Determine the dissociation energy of a salt given crystal properties

     Beginning in this section, we study crystalline solids, which consist of atoms arranged in an extended regular
     pattern called a lattice. Solids that do not or are unable to form crystals are classified as amorphous solids.
     Although amorphous solids (like glass) have a variety of interesting technological applications, the focus of this
     chapter will be on crystalline solids.

     Atoms arrange themselves in a lattice to form a crystal because of a net attractive force between their
     constituent electrons and atomic nuclei. The crystals formed by the bonding of atoms belong to one of three
     categories, classified by their bonding: ionic, covalent, and metallic. Molecules can also bond together to form
     crystals; these bonds, not discussed here, are classified as molecular. Early in the twentieth century, the atomic
     model of a solid was speculative. We now have direct evidence of atoms in solids (Figure 9.7).

Ionic Bonding in Solids

Many solids form by ionic bonding. A prototypical example is the sodium chloride crystal, as we discussed
earlier. Electrons transfer from sodium atoms to adjacent chlorine atoms, since the valence electrons in
sodium are loosely bound and chlorine has a large electron affinity. The positively charged sodium ions and
negatively charged chlorine (chloride) ions organize into an extended regular array of atoms (Figure 9.8).

 Figure 9.8 Structure of the sodium chloride crystal. The sodium and chloride ions are arranged in a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure.

The charge distributions of the sodium and chloride ions are spherically symmetric, and the chloride ion is
about two times the diameter of the sodium ion. The lowest energy arrangement of these ions is called the
face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. In this structure, each ion is closest to six ions of the other species. The
unit cell is a cube--an atom occupies the center and corners of each "face" of the cube. The attractive potential
404  9 · Condensed Matter Physics

     energy of the       ion due to the fields of these six ions is written

                                                                                                      9.14

     where the minus sign designates an attractive potential (and we identify  ). At a distance       are its

     next-nearest neighbors: twelve    ions of the same charge. The total repulsive potential energy associated

     with these ions is

                                                                                                      9.15

     Next closest are eight ions a distance  from the         ion. The potential energy of the  ion in the
     field of these eight ions is                                                                         9.16

     Continuing in the same manner with alternate sets of and  ions, we find that the net attractive

     potential energy of the single    ion can be written as

                                                                                                      9.17

     where is the Madelung constant, introduced earlier. From this analysis, we can see that this constant is the
     infinite converging sum

                                                                                                      9.18

     Distant ions make a significant contribution to this sum, so it converges slowly, and many terms must be used
     to calculate accurately. For all FCC ionic solids, is approximately 1.75.

     Other possible packing arrangements of atoms in solids include simple cubic and body-centered cubic (BCC).
     These three different packing structures of solids are compared in Figure 9.9. The first row represents the
     location, but not the size, of the ions; the second row indicates the unit cells of each structure or lattice; and the
     third row represents the location and size of the ions. The BCC structure has eight nearest neighbors, with a
     Madelung constant of about 1.76--only slightly different from that for the FCC structure. Determining the
     Madelung constant for specific solids is difficult work and the subject of current research.

Figure 9.9 Packing structures for solids from left to right: (a) simple cubic, (b) body-centered cubic (BCC), and (c) face-centered cubic
(FCC). Each crystal structure minimizes the energy of the system.

The energy of the sodium ions is not entirely due to attractive forces between oppositely charged ions. If the

ions are bought too close together, the wave functions of core electrons of the ions overlap, and the electrons

repel due to the exclusion principle. The total potential energy of the  ion is therefore the sum of the

attractive Coulomb potential     and the repulsive potential associated with the exclusion principle

Calculating this repulsive potential requires powerful computers. Fortunately, however, this energy can be

described accurately by a simple formula that contains adjustable parameters:

                                                                                                          9.19

where the parameters A and n are chosen to give predictions consistent with experimental data. For the

problem at the end of this chapter, the parameter n is referred to as the repulsion constant. The total potential

energy of the  ion is therefore

                                                                                                          9.20

At equilibrium, there is no net force on the ion, so the distance between neighboring  and ions must

be the value for which U is a minimum. Setting  , we have
406  9 · Condensed Matter Physics

                                                                                                                  9.21

     Thus,

                                                                                                                  9.22

     Inserting this expression into the expression for the total potential energy, we have

                                                                                                                  9.23

     Notice that the total potential energy now has only one adjustable parameter, n. The parameter A has been

     replaced by a function involving , the equilibrium separation distance, which can be measured by a

     diffraction experiment (you learned about diffraction in a previous chapter). The total potential energy is

     plotted in Figure 9.10 for        , the approximate value of n for NaCl.

     The energy per ion pair needed to separate the crystal into ions is therefore

                                                                                                                  9.25

     This is the dissociation energy of the solid. The dissociation energy can also be used to describe the total

Thus, we can determine the Madelung constant from the crystal structure and n from the lattice energy. For

NaCl, we have     ,  , and  This dissociation energy is relatively large. The

most energetic photon from the visible spectrum, for example, has an energy of approximately

     Because the ions in crystals are so tightly bound, ionic crystals have the following general characteristics:

1. They are fairly hard and stable.
2. They vaporize at relatively high temperatures (1000 to 2000 K).
3. They are transparent to visible radiation, because photons in the visible portion of the spectrum are not

     energetic enough to excite an electron from its ground state to an excited state.
4. They are poor electrical conductors, because they contain effectively no free electrons.
5. They are usually soluble in water, because the water molecule has a large dipole moment whose electric field is

     strong enough to break the electrostatic bonds between the ions.

EXAMPLE 9.3

The Dissociation Energy of Salt

Determine the dissociation energy of sodium chloride (NaCl) in kJ/mol. (Hint: The repulsion constant n of NaCl
is approximately 8.)

Strategy

A sodium chloride crystal has an equilibrium separation of 0.282 nm. (Compare this value with 0.236 nm for a
free diatomic unit of NaCl.) The dissociation energy depends on the separation distance, repulsion constant,
and Madelung constant for an FCC structure. The separation distance depends in turn on the molar mass and
measured density. We can determine the separation distance, and then use this value to determine the
dissociation energy for one mole of the solid.

Solution

The atomic masses of Na and Cl are 23.0 u and 58.4 u, so the molar mass of NaCl is 58.4 g/mol. The density of

NaCl is           . The relationship between these quantities is

where M is the mass of one mole of salt, is Avogadro's number, and is the equilibrium separation
distance. The factor 2 is needed since both the sodium and chloride ions represent a cubic volume . Solving
for the distance, we get

     or

     The potential energy of one ion pair      is

     where is the Madelung constant, is the equilibrium separation distance, and n is the repulsion constant.

     NaCl is FCC, so the Madelung constant is               Substituting these values, we get

     The dissociation energy of one mole of sodium chloride is therefore

     Significance

     This theoretical value of the dissociation energy of 766 kJ/mol is close to the accepted experimental value of
     787 kJ/mol. Notice that for larger density, the equilibrium separation distance between ion pairs is smaller, as
     expected. This small separation distance drives up the force between ions and therefore the dissociation
     energy. The conversion at the end of the equation took advantage of the conversion factor

     If the dissociation energy were larger, would that make it easier or more difficult to break the solid apart?

     Covalent Bonding in Solids

     Crystals can also be formed by covalent bonding. For example, covalent bonds are responsible for holding

     carbon atoms together in diamond crystals. The electron configuration of the carbon atom is  --a He

     core plus four valence electrons. This electron configuration is four electrons short of a full shell, so by sharing

     these four electrons with other carbon atoms in a covalent bond, the shells of all carbon atoms are filled.

     Diamond has a more complicated structure than most ionic crystals (Figure 9.11). Each carbon atom is the

     center of a regular tetrahedron, and the angle between the bonds is  This angle is a direct consequence of

     the directionality of the p orbitals of carbon atoms.

four carbon atoms represented by the light blue spheres. (b) Gem-quality diamonds can be cleaved along smooth planes, which gives a
large number of angles that cause total internal reflection of incident light, and thus gives diamonds their prized brilliance.

Covalently bonded crystals are not as uniform as ionic crystals but are reasonably hard, difficult to melt, and
are insoluble in water. For example, diamond has an extremely high melting temperature (4000 K) and is
transparent to visible light. In comparison, covalently bonded tin (also known as alpha-tin, which is
nonmetallic) is relatively soft, melts at 600 K, and reflects visible light. Two other important examples of
covalently bonded crystals are silicon and germanium. Both of these solids are used extensively in the
manufacture of diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. We will return to these materials later in our
discussion of semiconductors.

Metallic Bonding in Solids

As the name implies, metallic bonding is responsible for the formation of metallic crystals. The valence

electrons are essentially free of the atoms and are able to move relatively easily throughout the metallic

crystal. Bonding is due to the attractive forces between the positive ions and the conduction electrons. Metallic

bonds are weaker than ionic or covalent bonds, with dissociation energies in the range  .

9.4 Free Electron Model of Metals

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Describe the classical free electron model of metals in terms of the concept electron number density
 · Explain the quantum free-electron model of metals in terms of Pauli's exclusion principle
 · Calculate the energy levels and energy-level spacing of a free electron in a metal

Metals, such as copper and aluminum, are held together by bonds that are very different from those of
molecules. Rather than sharing and exchanging electrons, a metal is essentially held together by a system of
free electrons that wander throughout the solid. The simplest model of a metal is the free electron model.
This model views electrons as a gas. We first consider the simple one-dimensional case in which electrons
move freely along a line, such as through a very thin metal rod. The potential function U(x) for this case is a
one-dimensional infinite square well where the walls of the well correspond to the edges of the rod. This model
ignores the interactions between the electrons but respects the exclusion principle. For the special case of

             N electrons fill up the energy levels, from lowest to highest, two at a time (spin up and spin down),
until the highest energy level is filled. The highest energy filled is called the Fermi energy.

The one-dimensional free electron model can be improved by considering the three-dimensional case:
electrons moving freely in a three-dimensional metal block. This system is modeled by a three-dimensional
410  9 · Condensed Matter Physics

     infinite square well. Determining the allowed energy states requires us to solve the time-independent
     Schrödinger equation

                                                                                                                                                          9.26

     where we assume that the potential energy inside the box is zero and infinity otherwise. The allowed wave
     functions describing the electron's quantum states can be written as

                                                                                                                9.27

     where     and are positive integers representing quantum numbers corresponding to the motion in the

     x-, y-, and z-directions, respectively, and   are the dimensions of the box in those directions.

     Equation 9.27 is simply the product of three one-dimensional wave functions. The allowed energies of an

     electron in a cube                    are

                                                   

                                                                                                                                 9.28

     Associated with each set of quantum numbers   are two quantum states, spin up and spin down. In a

     real material, the number of filled states is enormous. For example, in a cubic centimeter of metal, this

     number is on the order of     Counting how many particles are in which state is difficult work, which often

     requires the help of a powerful computer. The effort is worthwhile, however, because this information is often

     an effective way to check the model.

            EXAMPLE 9.4

     Energy of a Metal Cube

     Consider a solid metal cube of edge length 2.0 cm. (a) What is the lowest energy level for an electron within the
     metal? (b) What is the spacing between this level and the next energy level?

     Strategy

     An electron in a metal can be modeled as a wave. The lowest energy corresponds to the largest wavelength and

     smallest quantum number:                      Equation 9.28 supplies this "ground state" energy value.

     Since the energy of the electron increases with the quantum number, the next highest level involves the

     smallest increase in the quantum numbers, or                or (1, 1, 2).

     Solution                                                    From Equation 9.28, the
     The lowest energy level corresponds to the quantum numbers

What happens to the ground state energy of an electron if the dimensions of the solid increase?

Often, we are not interested in the total number of particles in all states, but rather the number of particles dN
with energies in a narrow energy interval. This value can be expressed by

where n(E) is the electron number density, or the number of electrons per unit volume; g(E) is the density of
states, or the number of allowed quantum states per unit energy; dE is the size of the energy interval; and F is
the Fermi factor. The Fermi factor is the probability that the state will be filled. For example, if g(E)dE is 100
available states, but F is only , then the number of particles in this narrow energy interval is only five.
Finding g(E) requires solving Schrödinger's equation (in three dimensions) for the allowed energy levels. The
calculation is involved even for a crude model, but the result is simple:

                                                                                                          9.29

where V is the volume of the solid, is the mass of the electron, and E is the energy of the state. Notice that
the density of states increases with the square root of the energy. More states are available at high energy than
at low energy. This expression does not provide information of the density of the electrons in physical space,
but rather the density of energy levels in "energy space." For example, in our study of the atomic structure, we
learned that the energy levels of a hydrogen atom are much more widely spaced for small energy values (near
than ground state) than for larger values.

This equation tells us how many electron states are available in a three-dimensional metallic solid. However, it

does not tell us how likely these states will be filled. Thus, we need to determine the Fermi factor, F. Consider

the simple case of   . From classical physics, we expect that all the electrons                    would

simply go into the ground state to achieve the lowest possible energy. However, this violates Pauli's exclusion

principle, which states that no two electrons can be in the same quantum state. Hence, when we begin filling

the states with electrons, the states with lowest energy become occupied first, then states with progressively

higher energies. The last electron we put in has the highest energy. This energy is the Fermi energy of the

free electron gas. A state with energy  is occupied by a single electron, and a state with energy

is unoccupied. To describe this in terms of a probability F(E) that a state of energy E is occupied, we write for

:

To visualize how the quantum states are filled, we might imagine pouring water slowly into a glass, such as that
of Figure 9.13. The first drops of water (the electrons) occupy the bottom of the glass (the states with lowest
energy). As the level rises, states of higher and higher energy are occupied. Furthermore, since the glass has a
wide opening and a narrow stem, more water occupies the top of the glass than the bottom. This reflects the
fact that the density of states g(E) is proportional to , so there is a relatively large number of higher energy
electrons in a free electron gas. Finally, the level to which the glass is filled corresponds to the Fermi energy.

available states increases. The highest energy state (corresponding to the water line) is the Fermi energy. (credit: modification of work by

Suppose that at   , the number of conduction electrons per unit volume in our sample is . Since each

field state has one electron, the number of filled states per unit volume is the same as the number of electrons

      · Explain why some materials are good conductors and others are good insulators
      · Differentiate between an insulator and a semiconductor

     The free electron model explains many important properties of conductors but is weak in at least two areas.

     First, it assumes a constant potential energy within the solid. (Recall that a constant potential energy is

     associated with no forces.) Figure 9.14 compares the assumption of a constant potential energy (dotted line)

     with the periodic Coulomb potential, which drops as  at each lattice point, where r is the distance from the

     ion core (solid line). Second, the free electron model assumes an impenetrable barrier at the surface. This

     assumption is not valid, because under certain conditions, electrons can escape the surface--such as in the

     photoelectric effect. In addition to these assumptions, the free electron model does not explain the dramatic

     differences in electronic properties of conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. Therefore, a more

     complete model is needed.

     Figure 9.14 The periodic potential used to model electrons in a conductor. Each ion in the solid is the source of a Coulomb potential.
     Notice that the free electron model is productive because the average of this field is approximately constant.

     We can produce an improved model by solving Schrödinger's equation for the periodic potential shown in
     Figure 9.14. However, the solution requires technical mathematics far beyond our scope. We again seek a
     qualitative argument based on quantum mechanics to find a way forward.

     We first review the argument used to explain the energy structure of a covalent bond. Consider two identical

     hydrogen atoms so far apart that there is no interaction whatsoever between them. Further suppose that the

     electron in each atom is in the same ground state: a 1s electron with an energy of  (ignore spin). When

     the hydrogen atoms are brought closer together, the individual wave functions of the electrons overlap and, by

     the exclusion principle, can no longer be in the same quantum state, which splits the original equivalent

     energy levels into two different energy levels. The energies of these levels depend on the interatomic distance,

     (Figure 9.15).

     If four hydrogen atoms are brought together, four levels are formed from the four possible symmetries--a
     single sine wave "hump" in each well, alternating up and down, and so on. In the limit of a very large number N
     of atoms, we expect a spread of nearly continuous bands of electronic energy levels in a solid (see Figure
     9.15(c)). Each of these bands is known as an energy band. (The allowed states of energy and wave number are
     still technically quantized, but for large numbers of atoms, these states are so close together that they are

consider to be continuous or "in the continuum.")

Energy bands differ in the number of electrons they hold. In the 1s and 2s energy bands, each energy level
holds up to two electrons (spin up and spin down), so this band has a maximum occupancy of 2N electrons. In
the 2p energy band, each energy level holds up to six electrons, so this band has a maximum occupancy of 6N
electrons (Figure 9.16).

    Figure 9.16 A simple representation of the energy structure of a solid. Electrons belong to energy bands separated by energy gaps.

Each energy band is separated from the other by an energy gap. The electrical properties of conductors and
insulators can be understood in terms of energy bands and gaps. The highest energy band that is filled is
known as a valence band. The next available band in the energy structure is known as a conduction band. In a
conductor, the highest energy band that contains electrons is partially filled, whereas in an insulator, the
highest energy band containing electrons is completely filled. The difference between a conductor and
insulator is illustrated in Figure 9.17.

A conductor differs from an insulator in how its electrons respond to an applied electric field. If a significant
number of electrons are set into motion by the field, the material is a conductor. In terms of the band model,
electrons in the partially filled conduction band gain kinetic energy from the electric field by filling higher
energy states in the conduction band. By contrast, in an insulator, electrons belong to completely filled bands.
When the field is applied, the electrons cannot make such transitions (acquire kinetic energy from the electric
field) due to the exclusion principle. As a result, the material does not conduct electricity.

     A semiconductor has a similar energy structure to an insulator except it has a relatively small energy gap

     between the lowest completely filled band and the next available unfilled band. This type of material forms the

     basis of modern electronics. At   , the semiconductor and insulator both have completely filled bands.

     The only difference is in the size of the energy gap (or band gap) Eg between the highest energy band that is

     filled (the valence band) and the next-higher empty band (the conduction band). In a semiconductor, this gap is

     small enough that a substantial number of electrons from the valence band are thermally excited into the

     conduction band at room temperature. These electrons are then in a nearly empty band and can respond to an

     applied field. As a general rule of thumb, the band gap of a semiconductor is about 1 eV. (See Table 9.4 for

     silicon.) A band gap of greater than approximately 1 eV is considered an insulator. For comparison, the energy

     gap of diamond (an insulator) is several electron-volts.

 · Calculate the charge, drift velocity, and charge carrier number density of a semiconductor using information

      from a Hall effect experiment

In the preceding section, we considered only the contribution to the electric current due to electrons
occupying states in the conduction band. However, moving an electron from the valence band to the
conduction band leaves an unoccupied state or hole in the energy structure of the valence band, which a
nearby electron can move into. As these holes are filled by other electrons, new holes are created. The electric
current associated with this filling can be viewed as the collective motion of many negatively charged electrons
or the motion of the positively charged electron holes.

To illustrate, consider the one-dimensional lattice in Figure 9.18. Assume that each lattice atom contributes
one valence electron to the current. As the hole on the right is filled, this hole moves to the left. The current can
be interpreted as the flow of positive charge to the left. The density of holes, or the number of holes per unit
volume, is represented by p. Each electron that transitions into the conduction band leaves behind a hole. If
the conduction band is originally empty, the conduction electron density p is equal to the hole density, that is,

       .

              Figure 9.18 The motion of holes in a crystal lattice. As electrons shift to the right, an electron hole moves to the left.

As mentioned, a semiconductor is a material with a filled valence band, an unfilled conduction band, and a
relatively small energy gap between the bands. Excess electrons or holes can be introduced into the material
by the substitution into the crystal lattice of an impurity atom, which is an atom of a slightly different valence
number. This process is known as doping. For example, suppose we add an arsenic atom to a crystal of silicon
(Figure 9.19(a)).
418  9 · Condensed Matter Physics

     Figure 9.19 (a) A donor impurity and (b) an acceptor impurity. The introduction to impurities and acceptors into a semiconductor
     significantly changes the electronic properties of this material.

     Arsenic has five valence electrons, whereas silicon has only four. This extra electron must therefore go into the
     conduction band, since there is no room in the valence band. The arsenic ion left behind has a net positive
     charge that weakly binds the delocalized electron. The binding is weak because the surrounding atomic lattice
     shields the ion's electric field. As a result, the binding energy of the extra electron is only about 0.02 eV. In
     other words, the energy level of the impurity electron is in the band gap below the conduction band by 0.02 eV,
     a much smaller value than the energy of the gap, 1.14 eV. At room temperature, this impurity electron is easily
     excited into the conduction band and therefore contributes to the conductivity (Figure 9.20(a)). An impurity
     with an extra electron is known as a donor impurity, and the doped semiconductor is called an n-type
     semiconductor because the primary carriers of charge (electrons) are negative.

     Figure 9.20 (a) The extra electron from a donor impurity is excited into the conduction band; (b) formation of an impurity band in an
     n-type semiconductor.

     By adding more donor impurities, we can create an impurity band, a new energy band created by
     semiconductor doping, as shown in Figure 9.20(b). The Fermi level is now between this band and the
     conduction band. At room temperature, many impurity electrons are thermally excited into the conduction
     band and contribute to the conductivity. Conduction can then also occur in the impurity band as vacancies are
     created there. Note that changes in the energy of an electron correspond to a change in the motion (velocities
     or kinetic energy) of these charge carriers with the semiconductor, but not the bulk motion of the
     semiconductor itself.
     Doping can also be accomplished using impurity atoms that typically have one fewer valence electron than the
     semiconductor atoms. For example, Al, which has three valence electrons, can be substituted for Si, as shown
     in Figure 9.19(b). Such an impurity is known as an acceptor impurity, and the doped semiconductor is called
     a p-type semiconductor, because the primary carriers of charge (holes) are positive. If a hole is treated as a
     positive particle weakly bound to the impurity site, then an empty electron state is created in the band gap just
     above the valence band. When this state is filled by an electron thermally excited from the valence band
     (Figure 9.21(a)), a mobile hole is created in the valence band. By adding more acceptor impurities, we can
     create an impurity band, as shown in Figure 9.21(b).

Figure 9.21 (a) An electron from the conduction band is excited into the empty state resulting from the acceptor impurity; (b) formation of
an impurity band in a p-type semiconductor.

The electric current of a doped semiconductor can be due to the motion of a majority carrier, in which holes
are contributed by an impurity atom, or due to a minority carrier, in which holes are contributed purely by
thermal excitations of electrons across the energy gap. In an n-type semiconductor, majority carriers are free
electrons contributed by impurity atoms, and minority carriers are free electrons produced by thermal
excitations from the valence to the conduction band. In a p-type semiconductor, the majority carriers are free
holes contributed by impurity atoms, and minority carriers are free holes left by the filling of states due to
thermal excitation of electrons across the gap. In general, the number of majority carriers far exceeds the
minority carriers. The concept of a majority and minority carriers will be used in the next section to explain
the operation of diodes and transistors.

In studying p- and n-type doping, it is natural to ask: Do "electron holes" really act like particles? The existence

of holes in a doped p-type semiconductor is demonstrated by the Hall effect. The Hall effect is the production

of a potential difference due to the motion of a conductor through an external magnetic field (see The Hall

Effect). A schematic of the Hall effect is shown in Figure 9.22(a). A semiconductor strip is bathed in a uniform

magnetic field (which points into the paper). As the electron holes move from left to right through the

semiconductor, a Lorentz force drives these charges toward the upper end of the strip. (Recall that the motion

of the positively charged carriers is determined by the right-hand rule.) Positive charge continues to collect on

the upper edge of the strip until the force associated with the downward electric field between the upper and

lower edges of the strip      just balances the upward magnetic force  . Setting these forces

equal to each other, we have  . The voltage that develops across the strip is therefore

                                                                                                         9.33

where is the Hall voltage; v is the hole's drift velocity, or average velocity of a particle that moves in a
partially random fashion; B is the magnetic field strength; and w is the width of the strip. Note that the Hall
voltage is transverse to the voltage that initially produces current through the material. A measurement of the
sign of this voltage (or potential difference) confirms the collection of holes on the top side of the strip. The
magnitude of the Hall voltage yields the drift velocity (v) of the majority carriers.

Additional information can also be extracted from the Hall voltage. Note that the electron current density (the
amount of current per unit cross-sectional area of the semiconductor strip) is

                                                                                                                                                     9.34

where q is the magnitude of the charge, n is the number of charge carriers per unit volume, and v is the drift
velocity. The current density is easily determined by dividing the total current by the cross-sectional area of
the strip, q is charge of the hole (the magnitude of the charge of a single electron), and u is determined by the
Hall effect Equation 9.34. Hence, the above expression for the electron current density gives the number of
charge carriers per unit volume, n. A similar analysis can be conducted for negatively charged carriers in an
n-type material (see Figure 9.22).

     Semiconductors have many applications in modern electronics. We describe some basic semiconductor
     devices in this section. A great advantage of using semiconductors for circuit elements is the fact that many
     thousands or millions of semiconductor devices can be combined on the same tiny piece of silicon and
     connected by conducting paths. The resulting structure is called an integrated circuit (ic), and ic chips are the
     basis of many modern devices, from computers and smartphones to the internet and global communications
     networks.

     Diodes

     Perhaps the simplest device that can be created with a semiconductor is a diode. A diode is a circuit element
     that allows electric current to flow in only one direction, like a one-way valve (see Model of Conduction in
     Metals). A diode is created by joining a p-type semiconductor to an n-type semiconductor (Figure 9.23). The
     junction between these materials is called a p-n junction. A comparison of the energy bands of a silicon-based
     diode is shown in Figure 9.23(b). The positions of the valence and conduction bands are the same, but the
     impurity levels are quite different. When a p-n junction is formed, electrons from the conduction band of the
     n-type material diffuse to the p-side, where they combine with holes in the valence band. This migration of
     charge leaves positive ionized donor ions on the n-side and negative ionized acceptor ions on the p-side,
     producing a narrow double layer of charge at the p-n junction called the depletion layer. The electric field
     associated with the depletion layer prevents further diffusion. The potential energy for electrons across the p-
     n junction is given by Figure 9.24.

     Figure 9.24 At equilibrium, (a) excess charge resides near the interface and the net current is zero, and (b) the potential energy difference
     for electrons (in light blue) prevents further diffusion of electrons into the p-side.

     The behavior of a semiconductor diode can now be understood. If the positive side of the battery is connected
     to the n-type material, the depletion layer is widened, and the potential energy difference across the p-n
     junction is increased. Few or none of the electrons (holes) have enough energy to climb the potential barrier,
     and current is significantly reduced. This is called the reverse bias configuration. On the other hand, if the
     positive side of a battery is connected to the p-type material, the depletion layer is narrowed, the potential
     energy difference across the p-n junction is reduced, and electrons (holes) flow easily. This is called the
     forward bias configuration of the diode. In sum, the diode allows current to flow freely in one direction but
     prevents current flow in the opposite direction. In this sense, the semiconductor diode is a one-way valve.

     We can estimate the mathematical relationship between the current and voltage for a diode using the electric
     potential concept. Consider N negatively charged majority carriers (electrons donated by impurity atoms) in
     the n-type material and a potential barrier V across the p-n junction. According to the Maxwell-Boltzmann
     distribution, the fraction of electrons that have enough energy to diffuse across the potential barrier is

     . However, if a battery of voltage is applied in the forward-bias configuration, this fraction

A sample graph of the current versus bias voltage is given in Figure 9.25. In the forward bias configuration,

small changes in the bias voltage lead to large changes in the current. In the reverse bias configuration, the

current is     . For extreme values of reverse bias, the atoms in the material are ionized which triggers

an avalanche of current. This case occurs at the breakdown voltage.

     Junction Transistor

     If diodes are one-way valves, transistors are one-way valves that can be carefully opened and closed to control
     current. A special kind of transistor is a junction transistor. A junction transistor has three parts, including an
     n-type semiconductor, also called the emitter; a thin p-type semiconductor, which is the base; and another
     n-type semiconductor, called the collector (Figure 9.26). When a positive terminal is connected to the p-type
     layer (the base), a small current of electrons, called the base current flows to the terminal. This causes a
     large collector current to flow through the collector. The base current can be adjusted to control the large
     collector current. The current gain is therefore

                                                                                                                                                          9.37

     Figure 9.26 A junction transistor has three parts: emitter, base, and collector. Voltage applied to the base acts as a valve to control
     electric current from the emitter to the collector.

     A junction transistor can be used to amplify the voltage from a microphone to drive a loudspeaker. In this
     application, sound waves cause a diaphragm inside the microphone to move in and out rapidly (Figure 9.27).
     When the diaphragm is in the "in" position, a tiny positive voltage is applied to the base of the transistor. This

opens the transistor "valve" and allows a large electrical current flow to the loudspeaker. When the diaphragm
is in the "out" position, a tiny negative voltage is applied to the base of the transistor, which shuts off the
transistor valve so that no current flows to the loudspeaker. This shuts the transistor "valve" off so no current
flows to the loudspeaker. In this way, current to the speaker is controlled by the sound waves, and the sound is
amplified. Any electric device that amplifies a signal is called an amplifier.

In modern electronic devices, digital signals are used with diodes and transistors to perform tasks such as data
manipulation. Electric circuits carry two types of electrical signals: analog and digital (Figure 9.28). An analog
signal varies continuously, whereas a digital signal switches between two fixed voltage values, such as plus 1
volt and zero volts. In digital circuits like those found in computers, a transistor behaves like an on-off switch.
The transistor is either on, meaning the valve is completely open, or it is off, meaning the valve is completely
closed. Integrated circuits contain vast collections of transistors on a single piece of silicon. They are designed
to handle digital signals that represent ones and zeroes, which is also known as binary code. The invention of
the ic helped to launch the modern computer revolution.

Figure 9.28 Real-world data are often analog, meaning data can vary continuously. Intensity values of sound or visual images are usually
analog. These data are converted into digital signals for electronic processing in recording devices or computers. The digital signal is

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe the main features of a superconductor
      · Describe the BCS theory of superconductivity
      · Determine the critical magnetic field for T = 0 K from magnetic field data
      · Calculate the maximum emf or current for a wire to remain superconducting

     Electrical resistance can be considered as a measure of the frictional force in electrical current flow. Thus,
     electrical resistance is a primary source of energy dissipation in electrical systems such as electromagnets,
     electric motors, and transmission lines. Copper wire is commonly used in electrical wiring because it has one
     of the lowest room-temperature electrical resistivities among common conductors. (Actually, silver has a lower
     resistivity than copper, but the high cost and limited availability of silver outweigh its savings in energy over
     copper.)

     Although our discussion of conductivity seems to imply that all materials must have electrical resistance, we
     know that this is not the case. When the temperature decreases below a critical value for many materials, their
     electrical resistivity drops to zero, and the materials become superconductors (see Superconductors).

     Watch this NOVA video (https://openstax.org/l/21NOVA) excerpt, Making Stuff Colder, as an introduction to the
     topic of superconductivity and its many applications.

     Properties of Superconductors

     In addition to zero electrical resistance, superconductors also have perfect diamagnetism. In other words, in
     the presence of an applied magnetic field, the net magnetic field within a superconductor is always zero
     (Figure 9.29). Therefore, any magnetic field lines that pass through a superconducting sample when it is in its
     normal state are expelled once the sample becomes superconducting. These are manifestations of the
     Meissner effect, which you learned about in the chapter on current and resistance.

     Figure 9.29 (a) In the Meissner effect, a magnetic field is expelled from a material once it becomes superconducting. (b) A magnet can
     levitate above a superconducting material, supported by the force expelling the magnetic field. (credit b: modification of work by Kevin
     Jarrett)

     Interestingly, the Meissner effect is not a consequence of the resistance being zero. To see why, suppose that a
     sample placed in a magnetic field undergoes a transition in which its resistance drops to zero. From Ohm's law,

     Access for free at openstax.org.
                                                                                         9.8 · Superconductivity         427

the current density, j, in the sample is related to the net internal electric field, E, and the resistivity  by
          . If is zero, E must also be zero so that j can remain finite. Now E and the magnetic flux         through

the sample are related by Faraday's law as

                                                                                                             9.38

If E is zero,  is also zero, that is, the magnetic flux through the sample cannot change. The magnetic

field lines within the sample should therefore not be expelled when the transition occurs. Hence, it does not

follow that a material whose resistance goes to zero has to exhibit the Meissner effect. Rather, the Meissner

effect is a special property of superconductors.

Another important property of a superconducting material is its critical temperature, , the temperature
below which the material is superconducting. The known range of critical temperatures is from a fraction of 1
K to slightly above 100 K. Superconductors with critical temperatures near this higher limit are commonly
known as "high-temperature" superconductors. From a practical standpoint, superconductors for which

                are very important. At present, applications involving superconductors often still require that
superconducting materials be immersed in liquid helium (4.2 K) in order to keep them below their critical
temperature. The liquid helium baths must be continually replenished because of evaporation, and cooling
costs can easily outweigh the savings in using a superconductor. However, 77 K is the temperature of liquid
nitrogen, which is far more abundant and inexpensive than liquid helium. It would be much more cost-
effective if we could easily fabricate and use high-temperature superconductor components that only need to
be kept in liquid nitrogen baths to maintain their superconductivity.

High-temperature superconducting materials are presently in use in various applications. An example is the
production of magnetic fields in some particle accelerators. The ultimate goal is to discover materials that are
superconducting at room temperature. Without any cooling requirements, the bulk of electronic components
and transmission lines could be superconducting, resulting in dramatic and unprecedented increases in
efficiency and performance.

Another important property of a superconducting material is its critical magnetic field  which is the

maximum applied magnetic field at a temperature T that will allow a material to remain superconducting. An

applied field that is greater than the critical field will destroy the superconductivity. The critical field is zero at

the critical temperature and increases as the temperature decreases. Plots of the critical field versus

temperature for several superconducting materials are shown in Figure 9.30. The temperature dependence of

the critical field can be described approximately by

                                                                                                             9.39

where          is the critical field at absolute zero temperature. Table 9.5 lists the critical temperatures and fields

for two classes of superconductors: type I superconductor and type II superconductor. In general, type I

superconductors are elements, such as aluminum and mercury. They are perfectly diamagnetic below a

critical field BC(T), and enter the normal non-superconducting state once that field is exceeded. The critical

fields of type I superconductors are generally quite low (well below one tesla). For this reason, they cannot be

used in applications requiring the production of high magnetic fields, which would destroy their

superconducting state.

Type II superconductors are generally compounds or alloys involving transition metals or actinide series

elements. Almost all superconductors with relatively high critical temperatures are type II. They have two

critical fields, represented by  and     . When the field is below              type II superconductors are

perfectly diamagnetic, and no magnetic flux penetration into the material can occur. For a field exceeding

they are driven into their normal state. When the field is greater than         but less than

type II superconductors are said to be in a mixed state. Although there is some magnetic flux penetration in

the mixed state, the resistance of the material is zero. Within the superconductor, filament-like regions exist

that have normal electrical and magnetic properties interspersed between regions that are superconducting

with perfect diamagnetism. A representation of this state is given in Figure 9.31. The magnetic field is expelled

from the superconducting regions but exists in the normal regions. In general,  is very large compared

with the critical fields of type I superconductors, so wire made of type II superconducting material is suitable

for the windings of high-field magnets.

     Since this exceeds the critical 0.16 T, the wire does not remain superconducting.

     Superconductivity requires low temperatures and low magnetic fields. These simultaneous conditions are met
     less easily for Nb than for many other metals. For example, aluminum superconducts at temperatures 7 times
     lower and magnetic fields 18 times lower.

     What conditions are necessary for superconductivity?

     Theory of Superconductors

     A successful theory of superconductivity was developed in the 1950s by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and J.
     Robert Schrieffer, for which they received the Nobel Prize in 1972. This theory is known as the BCS theory.
     BCS theory is complex, so we summarize it qualitatively below.

     In a normal conductor, the electrical properties of the material are due to the most energetic electrons near the
     Fermi energy. In 1956, Cooper showed that if there is any attractive interaction between two electrons at the
     Fermi level, then the electrons can form a bound state in which their total energy is less than . Two such
     electrons are known as a Cooper pair.

     It is hard to imagine two electrons attracting each other, since they have like charge and should repel. However,
     the proposed interaction occurs only in the context of an atomic lattice. A depiction of the attraction is shown
     in Figure 9.32. Electron 1 slightly displaces the positively charged atomic nuclei toward itself as it travels past
     because of the Coulomb attraction. Electron 2 "sees" a region with a higher density of positive charge relative
     to the surroundings and is therefore attracted into this region and, therefore indirectly, to electron 1. Because
     of the exclusion principle, the two electrons of a Cooper pair must have opposite spin.

Figure 9.32 A Cooper pair can form as a result of the displacement of positive atomic nuclei. Electron 1 slightly displaces the positively
charged atomic nuclei toward itself as it travels past because of the Coulomb attraction. Electron 2 "sees" a region with a higher density of
positive charge relative to the surroundings and is therefore attracted into this region.

The BCS theory extends Cooper's ideas, which are for a single pair of electrons, to the entire free electron gas.
When the transition to the superconducting state occurs, all the electrons pair up to form Cooper pairs. On an
atomic scale, the distance between the two electrons making up a Cooper pair is quite large. Between these
electrons are typically about other electrons, each also pairs with a distant electron. Hence, there is
considerable overlap between the wave functions of the individual Cooper pairs, resulting in a strong
correlation among the motions of the pairs. They all move together "in step," like the members of a marching
band. In the superconducting transition, the density of states becomes drastically changed near the Fermi
level. As shown in Figure 9.33, an energy gap appears around because the collection of Cooper pairs has
lower ground state energy than the Fermi gas of noninteracting electrons. The appearance of this gap
characterizes the superconducting state. If this state is destroyed, then the gap disappears, and the density of
states reverts to that of the free electron gas.

Figure 9.33 A relatively large energy gap is formed around the Fermi energy when a material becomes superconducting. If this state is
destroyed, then the gap disappears, and the density of states reverts to that of the free electron gas.

The BCS theory is able to predict many of the properties observed in superconductors. Examples include the
Meissner effect, the critical temperature, the critical field, and, perhaps most importantly, the resistivity
becoming zero at a critical temperature. We can think about this last phenomenon qualitatively as follows. In a
normal conductor, resistivity results from the interaction of the conduction electrons with the lattice. In this
432  9 · Condensed Matter Physics

     interaction, the energy exchanged is on the order of  the thermal energy. In a superconductor, electric

     current is carried by the Cooper pairs. The only way for a lattice to scatter a Cooper pair is to break it up. The

     destruction of one pair then destroys the collective motion of all the pairs. This destruction requires energy on

     the order of     , which is the size of the energy gap. Below the critical temperature, there is not enough

     thermal energy available for this process, so the Cooper pairs travel unimpeded throughout the

     superconductor.

     Finally, it is interesting to note that no evidence of superconductivity has been found in the best normal
     conductors, such as copper and silver. This is not unexpected, given the BCS theory. The basis for the
     formation of the superconducting state is an interaction between the electrons and the lattice. In the best
     conductors, the electron-lattice interaction is weakest, as evident from their minimal resistivity. We might
     expect then that in these materials, the interaction is so weak that Cooper pairs cannot be formed, and
     superconductivity is therefore precluded.

     Way, and generate electrical power.

     The Sun is the main source of energy in the solar system. The Sun is 109 Earth diameters across, and accounts
     for more than of the total mass of the solar system. The Sun shines by fusing hydrogen
     nuclei--protons--deep inside its interior. Once this fuel is spent, the Sun will burn helium and, later, other
     nuclei. Nuclear fusion in the Sun is discussed toward the end of this chapter. In the meantime, we will
     investigate nuclear properties that govern all nuclear processes, including fusion.

     10.1 Properties of Nuclei

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe the composition and size of an atomic nucleus
      · Use a nuclear symbol to express the composition of an atomic nucleus
      · Explain why the number of neutrons is greater than protons in heavy nuclei
      · Calculate the atomic mass of an element given its isotopes

     The atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons (Figure 10.2). Protons and neutrons have

     approximately the same mass, but protons carry one unit of positive charge  and neutrons carry no

     charge. These particles are packed together into an extremely small space at the center of an atom. According

     to scattering experiments, the nucleus is spherical or ellipsoidal in shape, and about 1/100,000th the size of a

     hydrogen atom. If an atom were the size of a major league baseball stadium, the nucleus would be roughly the

     size of the baseball. Protons and neutrons within the nucleus are called nucleons.

           Figure 10.2 The atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. Protons are shown in blue, and neutrons are shown in red.

     Counts of Nucleons

     The number of protons in the nucleus is given by the atomic number, Z. The number of neutrons in the
     nucleus is the neutron number, N. The total number of nucleons is the mass number, A. These numbers are
     related by

                                                                                                                                                          10.1

     A nucleus is represented symbolically by

                                                                                                                                                          10.2

     where X represents the chemical element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number. For example,
           represents the carbon nucleus with six protons and six neutrons (or 12 nucleons).

     A graph of the number N of neutrons versus the number Z of protons for a range of stable nuclei (nuclides) is
     shown in Figure 10.3. For a given value of Z, multiple values of N (blue points) are possible. For small values of

Z, the number of neutrons equals the number of protons  and the data fall on the red line. For large

values of Z, the number of neutrons is greater than the number of protons  and the data points fall

above the red line. The number of neutrons is generally greater than the number of protons for

Figure 10.3 This graph plots the number of neutrons N against the number of protons Z for stable atomic nuclei. Larger nuclei, have more
neutrons than protons.

A chart based on this graph that provides more detailed information about each nucleus is given in Figure
10.4. This chart is called a chart of the nuclides. Each cell or tile represents a separate nucleus. The nuclei are
arranged in order of ascending Z (along the horizontal direction) and ascending N (along the vertical
direction).

     Figure 10.4 Partial chart of the nuclides. For stable nuclei (dark blue backgrounds), cell values represent the percentage of nuclei found
     on Earth with the same atomic number (percent abundance). For the unstable nuclei, the number represents the half-life.

     Atoms that contain nuclei with the same number of protons (Z) and different numbers of neutrons (N) are
     called isotopes. For example, hydrogen has three isotopes: normal hydrogen (1 proton, no neutrons),
     deuterium (one proton and one neutron), and tritium (one proton and two neutrons). Isotopes of a given atom
     share the same chemical properties, since these properties are determined by interactions between the outer
     electrons of the atom, and not the nucleons. For example, water that contains deuterium rather than hydrogen
     ("heavy water") looks and tastes like normal water. The following table shows a list of common isotopes.

Why do neutrons outnumber protons in heavier nuclei (Figure 10.5)? The answer to this question requires an

understanding of forces inside the nucleus. Two types of forces exist: (1) the long-range electrostatic

(Coulomb) force that makes the positively charged protons repel one another; and (2) the short-range strong

nuclear force that makes all nucleons in the nucleus attract one another. You may also have heard of a "weak"

nuclear force. This force is responsible for some nuclear decays, but as the name implies, it does not play a role

in stabilizing the nucleus against the strong Coulomb repulsion it experiences. We discuss strong nuclear force

in more detail in the next chapter when we cover particle physics. Nuclear stability occurs when the attractive

forces between nucleons compensate for the repulsive, long-range electrostatic forces between all protons in

the nucleus. For heavy nuclei  excess neutrons are necessary to keep the electrostatic interactions

from breaking the nucleus apart, as shown in Figure 10.3.

Figure 10.5 (a) The electrostatic force is repulsive and has long range. The arrows represent outward forces on protons (in blue) at the
nuclear surface by a proton (also in blue) at the center. (b) The strong nuclear force acts between neighboring nucleons. The arrows
represent attractive forces exerted by a neutron (in red) on its nearest neighbors.

Because of the existence of stable isotopes, we must take special care when quoting the mass of an element.
For example, Copper (Cu) has two stable isotopes:

Given these two "versions" of Cu, what is the mass of this element? The atomic mass of an element is defined

as the weighted average of the masses of its isotopes. Thus, the atomic mass of Cu is

     4 u. A helium nucleus is also called an alpha () particle.

     Nuclear Size

     The simplest model of the nucleus is a densely packed sphere of nucleons. The volume V of the nucleus is
     therefore proportional to the number of nucleons A, expressed by

     where r is the radius of a nucleus and k is a constant with units of volume. Solving for r, we have

10.2 Nuclear Binding Energy

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Calculate the mass defect and binding energy for a wide range of nuclei
 · Use a graph of binding energy per nucleon (BEN) versus mass number graph to assess the relative

      stability of a nucleus
 · Compare the binding energy of a nucleon in a nucleus to the ionization energy of an electron in an atom

The forces that bind nucleons together in an atomic nucleus are much greater than those that bind an electron

to an atom through electrostatic attraction. This is evident by the relative sizes of the atomic nucleus and the

atom           respectively). The energy required to pry a nucleon from the nucleus is therefore

much larger than that required to remove (or ionize) an electron in an atom. In general, all nuclear changes

involve large amounts of energy per particle undergoing the reaction. This has numerous practical

applications.

Mass Defect

According to nuclear particle experiments, the total mass of a nucleus  is less than the sum of the

masses of its constituent nucleons (protons and neutrons). The mass difference, or mass defect, is given by

                                                                                                           10.4

where     is the total mass of the protons,  is the total mass of the neutrons, and                is the mass

of the nucleus. According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, mass is a measure of the total energy of a

system (       ). Thus, the total energy of a nucleus is less than the sum of the energies of its constituent

nucleons. The formation of a nucleus from a system of isolated protons and neutrons is therefore an

exothermic reaction--meaning that it releases energy. The energy emitted, or radiated, in this process is

Now imagine this process occurs in reverse. Instead of forming a nucleus, energy is put into the system to
break apart the nucleus (Figure 10.6). The amount of energy required is called the total binding energy (BE),

   Binding Energy

   The binding energy is equal to the amount of energy released in forming the nucleus, and is therefore
   given by

                                                                                                                                                   10.5

Experimental results indicate that the binding energy for a nucleus with mass number        is roughly

proportional to the total number of nucleons in the nucleus, A. The binding energy of a magnesium nucleus

(      ), for example, is approximately two times greater than for the carbon nucleus ( ).

     nucleons has a greater mass than a system of bound nucleons.

     Solution
     From Equation 10.4, the mass defect for the deuteron is

     The binding energy of the deuteron is then

     Over two million electron volts are needed to break apart a deuteron into a proton and a neutron. This very
     large value indicates the great strength of the nuclear force. By comparison, the greatest amount of energy
     required to liberate an electron bound to a hydrogen atom by an attractive Coulomb force (an electromagnetic
     force) is about 10 eV.

     Graph of Binding Energy per Nucleon

     In nuclear physics, one of the most important experimental quantities is the binding energy per nucleon
     (BEN), which is defined by

                                                             10.6

     This quantity is the average energy required to remove an individual nucleon from a nucleus--analogous to the
     ionization energy of an electron in an atom. If the BEN is relatively large, the nucleus is relatively stable. BEN
     values are estimated from nuclear scattering experiments.

     A graph of binding energy per nucleon versus mass number A is given in Figure 10.7. This graph is considered
     by many physicists to be one of the most important graphs in physics. Two notes are in order. First, typical
     BEN values range from 6-10 MeV, with an average value of about 8 MeV. In other words, it takes several million
     electron volts to pry a nucleon from a typical nucleus, as compared to just 13.6 eV to ionize an electron in the
     ground state of hydrogen. This is why nuclear force is referred to as the "strong" nuclear force.

     Second, the graph rises at low A, peaks very near iron  and then tapers off at high A. The peak

     value suggests that the iron nucleus is the most stable nucleus in nature (it is also why nuclear fusion in the

     cores of stars ends with Fe). The reason the graph rises and tapers off has to do with competing forces in the

nucleus. At low values of A, attractive nuclear forces between nucleons dominate over repulsive electrostatic
forces between protons. But at high values of A, repulsive electrostatic forces between forces begin to
dominate, and these forces tend to break apart the nucleus rather than hold it together.

Figure 10.7 In this graph of binding energy per nucleon for stable nuclei, the BEN is greatest for nuclei with a mass near . Therefore,
fusion of nuclei with mass numbers much less than that of Fe, and fission of nuclei with mass numbers greater than that of Fe, are
exothermic processes.

As we will see, the BEN-versus-A graph implies that nuclei divided or combined release an enormous amount
of energy. This is the basis for a wide range of phenomena, from the production of electricity at a nuclear
power plant to sunlight.

     10.3 Radioactive Decay

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe the decay of a radioactive substance in terms of its decay constant and half-life
      · Use the radioactive decay law to estimate the age of a substance
      · Explain the natural processes that allow the dating of living tissue using

     In 1896, Antoine Becquerel discovered that a uranium-rich rock emits invisible rays that can darken a
     photographic plate in an enclosed container. Scientists offer three arguments for the nuclear origin of these
     rays. First, the effects of the radiation do not vary with chemical state; that is, whether the emitting material is
     in the form of an element or compound. Second, the radiation does not vary with changes in temperature or
     pressure--both factors that in sufficient degree can affect electrons in an atom. Third, the very large energy of
     the invisible rays (up to hundreds of eV) is not consistent with atomic electron transitions (only a few eV).
     Today, this radiation is explained by the conversion of mass into energy deep within the nucleus of an atom.
     The spontaneous emission of radiation from nuclei is called nuclear radioactivity (Figure 10.8).

     Figure 10.8 The international ionizing radiation symbol is universally recognized as the warning symbol for nuclear radiation.

     Radioactive Decay Law

     When an individual nucleus transforms into another with the emission of radiation, the nucleus is said to

     decay. Radioactive decay occurs for all nuclei with     and also for some unstable isotopes with

     The decay rate is proportional to the number of original (undecayed) nuclei N in a substance. The number of

     nuclei lost to decay,  in time interval dt, is written

where is called the decay constant. (The minus sign indicates the number of original nuclei decreases over
time.) In other words, the more nuclei available to decay, the more that do decay (in time dt). This equation can
be rewritten as

                                                                                                          10.8

Integrating both sides of the equation, and defining to be the number of nuclei at           , we obtain

                                                                                                          10.9

This gives us                                                                                             10.10
Taking the left and right sides of the equation as a power of e, we have the radioactive decay law.

Radioactive Decay Law                                                                                     10.11

The total number N of radioactive nuclei remaining after time t is

where is the decay constant for the particular nucleus.

The total number of nuclei drops very rapidly at first, and then more slowly (Figure 10.9).

Figure 10.9 A plot of the radioactive decay law demonstrates that the number of nuclei remaining in a decay sample drops dramatically
during the first moments of decay.

The half-life  of a radioactive substance is defined as the time for half of the original nuclei to decay (or

the time at which half of the original nuclei remain). The half-lives of unstable isotopes are shown in the chart

of nuclides in Figure 10.4. The number of radioactive nuclei remaining after an integer (n) number of half-lives

is therefore

                                                                                                          10.12

     Thus, if we know the half-life T1/2 of a radioactive substance, we can find its decay constant. The lifetime of a
     radioactive substance is defined as the average amount of time that a nucleus exists before decaying. The
     lifetime of a substance is just the reciprocal of the decay constant, written as

                                                                                                            10.16

     The activity A is defined as the magnitude of the decay rate, or

     The infinitesimal change dN in the time interval dt is negative because the number of parent (undecayed)

     particles is decreasing, so the activity (A) is positive. Defining the initial activity as  , we have

                                                                                                            10.18

Strategy
We can find the decay constant directly from Equation 10.15. To determine the activity, we first need to find the
number of nuclei present.

Solution

a. The decay constant is found to be

b. The atomic mass of     is 89.91 g. Using Avogadro's number                               atoms/mol, we find the

initial number of nuclei in 1.00 g of the material:

From this, we find that the activity at  for 1.00 g of strontium-90 is

Expressing in terms of the half-life of the substance, we get
                                                                                                                                                   10.19

Therefore, the activity is halved after one half-life. We can determine the decay constant by measuring the
activity as a function of time. Taking the natural logarithm of the left and right sides of Equation 10.17, we get

                                                                                                  10.20

This equation follows the linear form    . If we plot ln A versus t, we expect a straight line with slope

and y-intercept           (Figure 10.10(b)). Activity A is expressed in units of becquerels (Bq), where one

                          . This quantity can also be expressed in decays per minute or decays per year. One of

the most common units for activity is the curie (Ci), defined to be the activity of 1 g of  . The relationship

between the Bq and Ci is

Strategy

The activity of is determined using the equation     , where  is the decay constant and is the

number of radioactive nuclei. The number of nuclei in a 1.00-kg sample is determined in two steps. First,

we determine the number of nuclei using the concept of a mole. Second, we multiply this value by

                       (the known abundance of in a carbon sample from a living organism) to determine the
     number of nuclei in a living organism. The decay constant is determined from the known half-life of
     (available from Figure 10.4).

     Solution                                                          . Thus, the number of carbon nuclei in a

     The number of nuclei in 1 kg of carbon is therefore               Entering known values gives us
     Now we can find the activity A by using the equation

     or  decays per year. To convert this to the unit Bq, we simply convert years to seconds. Thus,

     or 250 decays per second. To express A in curies, we use the definition of a curie,

     Thus,

     Significance
     Approximately of the human body by weight is carbon. Hundreds of decays take place in the human
     body every second. Carbon-14 and other naturally occurring radioactive substances in the body compose a
     person's background exposure to nuclear radiation. As we will see later in this chapter, this activity level is well
     below the maximum recommended dosages.

     Radioactive Dating

     Radioactive dating is a technique that uses naturally occurring radioactivity to determine the age of a
     material, such as a rock or an ancient artifact. The basic approach is to estimate the original number of nuclei
     in a material and the present number of nuclei in the material (after decay), and then use the known value of
     the decay constant and Equation 10.10 to calculate the total time of the decay, t.

     An important method of radioactive dating is carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 nuclei are produced when high-
     energy solar radiation strikes nuclei in the upper atmosphere and subsequently decay with a half-life of
     5730 years. Radioactive carbon has the same chemistry as stable carbon, so it combines with the ecosphere
     and eventually becomes part of every living organism. Carbon-14 has an abundance of 1.3 parts per trillion of
     normal carbon. Therefore, if you know the number of carbon nuclei in an object, you multiply that number by

                       to find the number of nuclei in that object. When an organism dies, carbon exchange with the
     environment ceases, and is not replenished as it decays.

     By comparing the abundance of in an artifact, such as mummy wrappings, with the normal abundance in
     living tissue, it is possible to determine the mummy's age (or the time since the person's death). Carbon-14
     dating can be used for biological tissues as old as 50,000 years, but is generally most accurate for younger
     samples, since the abundance of nuclei in them is greater. Very old biological materials contain no at

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe and compare three types of nuclear radiation
      · Use nuclear symbols to describe changes that occur during nuclear reactions
      · Describe processes involved in the decay series of heavy elements

     Early experiments revealed three types of nuclear "rays" or radiation: alpha ( ) rays, beta ( ) rays, and
     gamma ( ) rays. These three types of radiation are differentiated by their ability to penetrate matter. Alpha
     radiation is barely able to pass through a thin sheet of paper. Beta radiation can penetrate aluminum to a depth
     of about 3 mm, and gamma radiation can penetrate lead to a depth of 2 or more centimeters (Figure 10.11).

     Figure 10.11 A comparison of the penetration depths of alpha ( ), beta ( ), and gamma ( ) radiation through various materials.

     The electrical properties of these three types of radiation are investigated by passing them through a uniform

     magnetic field, as shown in Figure 10.12. According to the magnetic force equation  positively

     charged particles are deflected upward, negatively charged particles are deflected downward, and particles

     with no charge pass through the magnetic field undeflected. Eventually, rays were identified with helium

     nuclei  rays with electrons and positrons (positively charged electrons or antielectrons), and rays

     with high-energy photons. We discuss alpha, beta, and gamma radiation in detail in the remainder of this

paths of the particles depend on their masses and initial kinetic energies.

Alpha Decay

Heavy unstable nuclei emit radiation. In -particle decay (or alpha decay), the nucleus loses two protons and
two neutrons, so the atomic number decreases by two, whereas its mass number decreases by four. Before the
decay, the nucleus is called the parent nucleus. The nucleus or nuclei produced in the decay are referred to as
the daughter nucleus or daughter nuclei. We represent an decay symbolically by

                                                                                                    10.21

dream of the ancient alchemists to turn other metals into gold is scientifically feasible through the alpha-decay

process. The efforts of the alchemists failed because they relied on chemical interactions rather than nuclear

interactions.

An example of alpha decay is uranium-238:

Uranium-238 has decayed to Thorium-234 by the emission of an particle, written

takes the form of kinetic energies of the thorium and helium nuclei, although the kinetic energy of thorium is

smaller than helium due to its heavier mass and smaller velocity.

     Plutonium Alpha Decay

     Find the energy emitted in the decay of          .

     Strategy

     The energy emitted in the decay of            can be found using the equation     We must first find

     the difference in mass between the parent nucleus and the products of the decay.

     Solution
     The decay equation is

     Thus, the pertinent masses are those of       ,     , and the particle or      , all of which are known. The
     initial mass was
                                                   The final mass is the sum

     Thus,

     Now we can find E by entering into the equation:

     We know                           so we have

     Significance

     The energy released in this decay is in the MeV range, many times greater than chemical reaction energies.

     Most of this energy becomes kinetic energy of the particle (or nucleus), which moves away at high speed.

     The energy carried away by the recoil of the        nucleus is much smaller due to its relatively large mass. The

     nucleus can be left in an excited state to later emit photons ( rays).

     Beta Decay

     In most particle decays (or beta decay), either an electron ( ) or positron ( ) is emitted by a nucleus. A

     positron has the same mass as the electron, but its charge is . For this reason, a positron is sometimes

     called an antielectron. How does decay occur? A possible explanation is the electron (positron) is confined to

     the nucleus prior to the decay and somehow escapes. To obtain a rough estimate of the escape energy, consider

     a simplified model of an electron trapped in a box (or in the terminology of quantum mechanics, a one-

     dimensional square well) that has the width of a typical nucleus (       ). According to the Heisenberg

     uncertainty principle in Quantum Mechanics, the uncertainty of the momentum of the electron is:

Taking this momentum value (an underestimate) to be the "true value," the kinetic energy of the electron on
escape is approximately

Experimentally, the electrons emitted in decay are found to have kinetic energies of the order of only a few
MeV. We therefore conclude that the electron is somehow produced in the decay rather than escaping the
nucleus. Particle production (annihilation) is described by theories that combine quantum mechanics and
relativity, a subject of a more advanced course in physics.

Nuclear beta decay involves the conversion of one nucleon into another. For example, a neutron can decay to a
proton by the emission of an electron ( ) and a nearly massless particle called an antineutrino ( ):

The notation is used to designate the electron. Its mass number is 0 because it is not a nucleon, and its
atomic number is to signify that it has a charge of . The proton is represented by because its mass
number and atomic number are 1. When this occurs within an atomic nucleus, we have the following equation
for beta decay:

                                                                                                                                                   10.22

As discussed in another chapter, this process occurs due to the weak nuclear force.

     INTERACTIVE

Watch beta decay (https://openstax.org/l/21betadecayvid) occur for a collection of nuclei or for an individual
nucleus.

As an example, the isotope  is unstable and decays by emission with a half-life of 24 days. Its decay
can be represented as

Since the chemical element with atomic number 91 is protactinium (Pa), we can write the  decay of thorium
as

The reverse process is also possible: A proton can decay to a neutron by the emission of a positron (  ) and a
nearly massless particle called a neutrino (v). This reaction is written as

The positron is emitted with the neutrino v, and the neutron remains in the nucleus. (Like decay, the

positron does not precede the decay but is produced in the decay.) For an isolated proton, this process is
impossible because the neutron is heavier than the proton. However, this process is possible within the
nucleus because the proton can receive energy from other nucleons for the transition. As an example, the

isotope of aluminum  decays by emission with a half-life of  The decay is written as

The atomic number 12 corresponds to magnesium. Hence,

As a nuclear reaction, positron emission can be written as

     The neutrino was not detected in the early experiments on decay. However, the laws of energy and
     momentum seemed to require such a particle. Later, neutrinos were detected through their interactions with
     nuclei.

     Bismuth Alpha and Beta Decay

     The  nucleus undergoes both and      decay. For each case, what is the daughter nucleus?

     Strategy
     We can use the processes described by Equation 10.21 and Equation 10.22, as well as the Periodic Table, to
     identify the resulting elements.

     Solution
     The atomic number and the mass number for the particle are 2 and 4, respectively. Thus, when a
     bismuth-211 nucleus emits an particle, the daughter nucleus has an atomic number of 81 and a mass
     number of 207. The element with an atomic number of 81 is thallium, so the decay is given by

     In decay, the atomic number increases by 1, while the mass number stays the same. The element with an
     atomic number of 84 is polonium, so the decay is given by

     In radioactive beta decay, does the atomic mass number, A, increase or decrease?

     Gamma Decay

     A nucleus in an excited state can decay to a lower-level state by the emission of a "gamma-ray" photon, and
     this is known as gamma decay. This is analogous to de-excitation of an atomic electron. Gamma decay is
     represented symbolically by

                                                                                                             10.24

     where the asterisk (*) on the nucleus indicates an excited state. In decay, neither the atomic number nor the
     mass number changes, so the type of nucleus does not change.

     Radioactive Decay Series

     Nuclei with           are unstable and decay naturally. Many of these nuclei have very short lifetimes, so they

     are not found in nature. Notable exceptions include  (or Th-232) with a half-life of      years,

     and  (or U-238) with a half-life of  years. When a heavy nucleus decays to a lighter one, the

     lighter daughter nucleus can become the parent nucleus for the next decay, and so on. This process can
     produce a long series of nuclear decays called a decay series. The series ends with a stable nucleus.

     To illustrate the concept of a decay series, consider the decay of Th-232 series (Figure 10.13). The neutron

     number, N, is plotted on the vertical y-axis, and the atomic number, Z, is plotted on the horizontal x-axis, so

     Th-232 is found at the coordinates                   Th-232 decays by emission with a half-life of

The neutron number for Radium-228 is 140, so it is found in the diagram at the coordinates
                            Radium-228 is also unstable and decays by emission with a half-life of 5.76 years to

Actinum-228. The atomic number increases by 1, the mass number remains the same, and the neutron
number decreases by 1. Notice that in the graph, emission appears as a line sloping downward to the left,
with both N and Z decreasing by 2. Beta emission, on the other hand, appears as a line sloping downward to
the right with N decreasing by 1, and Z increasing by 1. After several additional alpha and beta decays, the
series ends with the stable nucleus Pb-208.

The relative frequency of different types of radioactive decays (alpha, beta, and gamma) depends on many
factors, including the strength of the forces involved and the number of ways a given reaction can occur
without violating the conservation of energy and momentum. How often a radioactive decay occurs often
depends on a sensitive balance of the strong and electromagnetic forces. These forces are discussed in Particle
Physics and Cosmology.

decays increase the atomic number, as indicated by the blue arrows. The series ends at the stable nucleus Pb-208.

As another example, consider the U-238 decay series shown in Figure 10.14. After numerous alpha and beta

decays, the series ends with the stable nucleus Pb-206. An example of a decay whose parent nucleus no longer

exists naturally is shown in Figure 10.15. It starts with Neptunium-237 and ends in the stable nucleus

Bismuth-209. Neptunium is called a transuranic element because it lies beyond uranium in the periodic

table. Uranium has the highest atomic number  of any element found in nature. Elements with

can be produced only in the laboratory. They most probably also existed in nature at the time of the

formation of Earth, but because of their relatively short lifetimes, they have completely decayed. There is

Radioactivity in the Earth

According to geologists, if there were no heat source, Earth should have cooled to its present temperature in no
more than 1 billion years. Yet, Earth is more than 4 billion years old. Why is Earth cooling so slowly? The
answer is nuclear radioactivity, that is, high-energy particles produced in radioactive decays heat Earth from
the inside (Figure 10.16).
464  10 · Nuclear Physics

     Figure 10.16 Earth is heated by nuclear reactions (alpha, beta, and gamma decays). Without these reactions, Earth's core and mantle
     would be much cooler than it is now.

     Candidate nuclei for this heating model are  , which possess half-lives similar to or longer than

     the age of Earth. The energy produced by these decays (per second per cubic meter) is small, but the energy

     cannot escape easily, so Earth's core is very hot. Thermal energy in Earth's core is transferred to Earth's

     surface and away from it through the processes of convection, conduction, and radiation.

     10.5 Fission

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe the process of nuclear fission in terms of its product and reactants
      · Calculate the energies of particles produced by a fission reaction
      · Explain the fission concept in the context of fission bombs and nuclear reactions

     In 1934, Enrico Fermi bombarded chemical elements with neutrons in order to create isotopes of other
     elements. He assumed that bombarding uranium with neutrons would make it unstable and produce a new
     element. Unfortunately, Fermi could not determine the products of the reaction. Several years later, Otto Hahn
     and Fritz Strassman reproduced these experiments and discovered that the products of these reactions were
     smaller nuclei. From this, they concluded that the uranium nucleus had split into two smaller nuclei.

     The splitting of a nucleus is called fission. Interestingly, U-235 fission does not always produce the same
     fragments. Example fission reactions include:

     In each case, the sum of the masses of the product nuclei are less than the masses of the reactants, so the

     fission of uranium is an exothermic process  This is the idea behind the use of fission reactors as

sources of energy (Figure 10.17). The energy carried away by the reaction takes the form of particles with
kinetic energy. The percent yield of fragments from a U-235 fission is given in Figure 10.18.

Figure 10.17 The Phillipsburg Nuclear Power Plant in Germany uses a fission reactor to generate electricity.

Figure 10.18 In this graph of fission fragments from U-235, the peaks in the graph indicate nuclei that are produced in the greatest
abundance by the fission process.

Energy changes in a nuclear fission reaction can be understood in terms of the binding energy per nucleon

curve (Figure 10.7). The BEN value for uranium  is slightly lower than its daughter nuclei, which lie

closer to the iron (Fe) peak. This means that nucleons in the nuclear fragments are more tightly bound than
466  10 · Nuclear Physics

     those in the U-235 nucleus. Therefore, a fission reaction results in a drop in the average energy of a nucleon.
     This energy is carried away by high-energy neutrons.

     Niels Bohr and John Wheeler developed the liquid drop model to understand the fission process. According to
     this model, firing a neutron at a nucleus is analogous to disturbing a droplet of water (Figure 10.19). The
     analogy works because short-range forces between nucleons in a nucleus are similar to the attractive forces
     between water molecules in a water droplet. In particular, forces between nucleons at the surface of the
     nucleus result in a surface tension similar to that of a water droplet. A neutron fired into a uranium nucleus
     can set the nucleus into vibration. If this vibration is violent enough, the nucleus divides into smaller nuclei
     and also emits two or three individual neutrons.

        Figure 10.19 In the liquid drop model of nuclear fission, the uranium nucleus is split into two lighter nuclei by a high-energy neutron.

     U-235 fission can produce a chain reaction. In a compound consisting of many U-235 nuclei, neutrons in the
     decay of one U-235 nucleus can initiate the fission of additional U-235 nuclei (Figure 10.20). This chain
     reaction can proceed in a controlled manner, as in a nuclear reactor at a power plant, or proceed
     uncontrollably, as in an explosion.

The Atomic Bomb

The possibility of a chain reaction in uranium, with its extremely large energy release, led nuclear scientists to

conceive of making a bomb--an atomic bomb. (These discoveries were taking place in the years just prior to

the Second World War and many of the European physicists involved in these discoveries came from countries

that were being overrun.) Natural uranium contains  U-238 and only  U-235, and does not produce

a chain reaction. To produce a controlled, sustainable chain reaction, the percentage of U-235 must be

increased to about . In addition, the uranium sample must be massive enough so a typical neutron is more

likely to induce fission than it is to escape. The minimum mass needed for the chain reaction to occur is called

the critical mass. When the critical mass reaches a point at which the chain reaction becomes self-sustaining,

this is a condition known as criticality. The original design required two pieces of U-235 below the critical

mass. When one piece in the form of a bullet is fired into the second piece, the critical mass is exceeded and a

chain reaction is produced.

An important obstacle to the U-235 bomb is the production of a critical mass of fissionable material. Therefore,
scientists developed a plutonium-239 bomb because Pu-239 is more fissionable than U-235 and thus requires
a smaller critical mass. The bomb was made in the form of a sphere with pieces of plutonium, each below the
468  10 · Nuclear Physics

     critical mass, at the edge of the sphere. A series of chemical explosions fired the plutonium pieces toward the
     center of the sphere simultaneously. When all these pieces of plutonium came together, the combination
     exceeded the critical mass and produced a chain reaction. Both the U-235 and Pu-239 bombs were used in
     World War II. Whether to develop and use atomic weapons remain two of the most important questions faced
     by human civilization.

     Strategy

     As always, the energy released is equal to the mass destroyed times  , so we must find the difference in mass

     between the parent     and the fission products.

     Solution
     The products have a total mass of

     The mass lost is the mass of       or

     Therefore, the energy released is

     Significance

     Several important things arise in this example. The energy release is large but less than it would be if the
     nucleus split into two equal parts, since energy is carried away by neutrons. However, this fission reaction

     produces neutrons and does not split the nucleus into two equal parts. Fission of a given nuclide, such as           ,

     does not always produce the same products. Fission is a statistical process in which an entire range of

     products are produced with various probabilities. Most fission produces neutrons, although the number varies.

     This is an extremely important aspect of fission, because neutrons can induce more fission, enabling self-

     sustaining chain reactions.

     Fission Nuclear Reactors

     The first nuclear reactor was built by Enrico Fermi on a squash court on the campus of the University of

     Chicago on December 2, 1942. The reactor itself contained U-238 enriched with  U-235. Neutrons

     produced by the chain reaction move too fast to initiate fission reactions. One way to slow them down is to

     enclose the entire reactor in a water bath under high pressure. The neutrons collide with the water molecules

     and are slowed enough to be used in the fission process. The slowed neutrons split more U-235 nuclei and a

     chain reaction occurs. The rate at which the chain reaction proceeds is controlled by a series of "control" rods

     made of cadmium inserted into the reactor. Cadmium is capable of absorbing a large number of neutrons

     without becoming unstable.

     A nuclear reactor design, called a pressurized water reactor, can also be used to generate electricity (Figure
     10.21). A pressurized water reactor (on the left in the figure) is designed to control the fission of large amounts

of  . The energy released in this process is absorbed by water flowing through pipes in the system (the

"primary loop") and steam is produced. Cadmium control rods adjust the neutron flux (the rate of flow of

neutrons passing through the system) and therefore control the reaction. In case the reactor overheats and the

water boils away, the chain reaction terminates, because water is used to thermalize the neutrons. (This safety

feature can be overwhelmed in extreme circumstances.) The hot, high-pressure water then passes through a

pipe to a second tank of water at normal pressure in the steam generator. The steam produced at one end of

the steam generator fills a chamber that contains a turbine. This steam is at a very high pressure. Meanwhile, a

steam condenser connected to the other side of the turbine chamber maintains steam at low pressure. The

pressure differences force steam through the chamber, which turns the turbine. The turbine, in turn, powers

an electric generator.

Figure 10.21 A nuclear reactor uses the energy produced in the fission of U-235 to produce electricity. Energy from a nuclear fission
reaction produces hot, high-pressure steam that turns a turbine. As the turbine turns, electricity is produced.

The major drawback to a fission reactor is nuclear waste. U-235 fission produces nuclei with long half-lives

such as  that must be stored. These products cannot be dumped into oceans or left in any place where

they will contaminate the environment, such as through the soil, air, or water. Many scientists believe that the

best place to store nuclear waste is the bottom of old salt mines or inside of stable mountains.

Many people are fearful that a nuclear reactor may explode like an atomic bomb. However, a nuclear reactor
does not contain enough U-235 to do this. Also, a nuclear reactor is designed so that failure of any mechanism
of the reactor causes the cadmium control rods to fall fully into the reactor, stopping the fission process. As
evidenced by the Fukushima and Chernobyl disasters, such systems can fail. Systems and procedures to avoid
such disasters is an important priority for advocates of nuclear energy.

If all electrical power were produced by nuclear fission of U-235, Earth's known reserves of uranium would be
depleted in less than a century. However, Earth's supply of fissionable material can be expanded considerably
using a breeder reactor. A breeder reactor operates for the first time using the fission of U-235 as just
described for the pressurized water reactor. But in addition to producing energy, some of the fast neutrons
originating from the fission of U-235 are absorbed by U-238, resulting in the production of Pu-239 via the set
of reactions

The Pu-239 is itself highly fissionable and can therefore be used as a nuclear fuel in place of U-235. Since
         of naturally occurring uranium is the U-238 isotope, the use of breeder reactors should increase our

supply of nuclear fuel by roughly a factor of 100. Breeder reactors are now in operation in Great Britain,
470  10 · Nuclear Physics

     France, and Russia. Breeder reactors also have drawbacks. First, breeder reactors produce plutonium, which
     can, if leaked into the environment, produce serious public health problems. Second, plutonium can be used
     to build bombs, thus increasing significantly the risk of nuclear proliferation.

     EXAMPLE 10.10

     Calculating Energy of Fissionable Fuel

     Calculate the amount of energy produced by the fission of 1.00 kg of         given that the average fission

     reaction of    produces 200 MeV.

     Strategy

     The total energy produced is the number of  atoms times the given energy per           fission. We should

     therefore find the number of         atoms in 1.00 kg.

     Solution

     The number of         atoms in 1.00 kg is Avogadro's number times the number of moles. One mole of           has

     a mass of 235.04 g; thus, there are                                   The number of           atoms is

     therefore

     Thus, the total energy released is

     Significance

     This is another impressively large amount of energy, equivalent to about 14,000 barrels of crude oil or 600,000
     gallons of gasoline. However, it is only one-fourth the energy produced by the fusion of a kilogram mixture of
     deuterium and tritium. Even though each fission reaction yields about 10 times the energy of a fusion reaction,
     the energy per kilogram of fission fuel is less, because there are far fewer moles per kilogram of the heavy

     nuclides. Fission fuel is also much scarcer than fusion fuel, and less than  of uranium (the  ) is readily
     usable.

           nucleosynthesis

     The process of combining lighter nuclei to make heavier nuclei is called nuclear fusion. As with fission
     reactions, fusion reactions are exothermic--they release energy. Suppose that we fuse a carbon and helium
     nuclei to produce oxygen:

     The energy changes in this reaction can be understood using a graph of binding energy per nucleon (Figure
     10.7). Comparing the binding energy per nucleon for oxygen, carbon, and helium, the oxygen nucleus is much

more tightly bound than the carbon and helium nuclei, indicating that the reaction produces a drop in the
energy of the system. This energy is released in the form of gamma radiation. Fusion reactions are said to be
exothermic when the amount of energy released (known as the Q value) in each reaction is greater than zero

An important example of nuclear fusion in nature is the production of energy in the Sun. In 1938, Hans Bethe

proposed that the Sun produces energy when hydrogen nuclei ( ) fuse into stable helium nuclei  in the

Sun's core (Figure 10.22). This process, called the proton-proton chain, is summarized by three reactions:

Thus, a stable helium nucleus is formed from the fusion of the nuclei of the hydrogen atom. These three
reactions can be summarized by

The net Q value is about 26 MeV. The release of this energy produces an outward thermal gas pressure that
prevents the Sun from gravitational collapse. Astrophysicists find that hydrogen fusion supplies the energy
stars require to maintain energy balance over most of a star's life span.

Figure 10.22 The Sun produces energy by fusing hydrogen into helium at the Sun's core. The red arrows show outward pressure due to
thermal gas, which tends to make the Sun expand. The blue arrows show inward pressure due to gravity, which tends to make the Sun
contract. These two influences balance each other.

Nucleosynthesis

Scientist now believe that many heavy elements found on Earth and throughout the universe were originally
synthesized by fusion within the hot cores of the stars. This process is known as nucleosynthesis. For
example, in lighter stars, hydrogen combines to form helium through the proton-proton chain. Once the
hydrogen fuel is exhausted, the star enters the next stage of its life and fuses helium. An example of a nuclear
reaction chain that can occur is:
472  10 · Nuclear Physics

     Carbon and oxygen nuclei produced in such processes eventually reach the star's surface by convection. Near
     the end of its lifetime, the star loses its outer layers into space, thus enriching the interstellar medium with the
     nuclei of heavier elements (Figure 10.23).

     Figure 10.23 A planetary nebula is produced at the end of the life of a star. The greenish color of this planetary nebula comes from oxygen
     ions. (credit: Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA/NASA/ESA) )

     Stars similar in mass to the Sun do not become hot enough to fuse nuclei as heavy (or heavier) than oxygen

     nuclei. However, in massive stars whose cores become much hotter  even more complex

     nuclei are produced. Some representative reactions are

     Nucleosynthesis continues until the core is primarily iron-nickel metal. Now, iron has the peculiar property

     that any fusion or fission reaction involving the iron nucleus is endothermic, meaning that energy is absorbed

     rather than produced. Hence, nuclear energy cannot be generated in an iron-rich core. Lacking an outward

     pressure from fusion reactions, the star begins to contract due to gravity. This process heats the core to a

     temperature on the order of       Expanding shock waves generated within the star due to the collapse

     cause the star to quickly explode. The luminosity of the star can increase temporarily to nearly that of an entire

     galaxy. During this event, the flood of energetic neutrons reacts with iron and the other nuclei to produce

     elements heavier than iron. These elements, along with much of the star, are ejected into space by the

     explosion. Supernovae and the formation of planetary nebulas together play a major role in the dispersal of

     chemical elements into space.

     Eventually, much of the material lost by stars is pulled together through the gravitational force, and it
     condenses into a new generation of stars and accompanying planets. Recent images from the Hubble Space
     Telescope provide a glimpse of this magnificent process taking place in the constellation Serpens (Figure

heavier elements. Thus, stars are "factories" for the chemical elements, and many of the atoms in our bodies
were once a part of stars.

EXAMPLE 10.11

Energy of the Sun

The power output of the Sun is approximately        Most of this energy is produced in the Sun's core

by the proton-proton chain. This energy is transmitted outward by the processes of convection and radiation.

(a) How many of these fusion reactions per second must occur to supply the power radiated by the Sun? (b)

What is the rate at which the mass of the Sun decreases? (c) In about five billion years, the central core of the

Sun will be depleted of hydrogen. By what percentage will the mass of the Sun have decreased from its present

value when the core is depleted of hydrogen?

Strategy

The total energy output per second is given in the problem statement. If we know the energy released in each
fusion reaction, we can determine the rate of the fusion reactions. If the mass loss per fusion reaction is
known, the mass loss rate is known. Multiplying this rate by five billion years gives the total mass lost by the
Sun. This value is divided by the original mass of the Sun to determine the percentage of the Sun's mass that
has been lost when the hydrogen fuel is depleted.

Solution

a. The decrease in mass for the fusion reaction is

     The energy released per fusion reaction is     there must be
     Thus, to supply                                     per fusion reaction, so the rate at which its mass

     The current mass of the Sun is about                 so the percentage decrease in its mass when its
     hydrogen fuel is depleted will be

     Significance
     After five billion years, the Sun is very nearly the same mass as it is now. Hydrogen burning does very little to
     change the mass of the Sun. This calculation assumes that only the proton-proton decay change is responsible
     for the power output of the Sun.

     Where does the energy from the Sun originate?

     The Hydrogen Bomb

     In 1942, Robert Oppenheimer suggested that the extremely high temperature of an atomic bomb could be used
     to trigger a fusion reaction between deuterium and tritium, thus producing a fusion (or hydrogen) bomb. The
     reaction between deuterium and tritium, both isotopes of hydrogen, is given by

     Deuterium is relatively abundant in ocean water but tritium is scarce. However, tritium can be generated in a
     nuclear reactor through a reaction involving lithium. The neutrons from the reactor cause the reaction

     to produce the desired tritium. The first hydrogen bomb was detonated in 1952 on the remote island of
     Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands. A hydrogen bomb has never been used in war. Modern hydrogen bombs are
     approximately 1000 times more powerful than the fission bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in
     World War II.

     The Fusion Reactor

     The fusion chain believed to be the most practical for use in a nuclear fusion reactor is the following two-step
     process:

     This chain, like the proton-proton chain, produces energy without any radioactive by-product. However, there

     is a very difficult problem that must be overcome before fusion can be used to produce significant amounts of

     energy: Extremely high temperatures   are needed to drive the fusion process. To meet this challenge,

     test fusion reactors are being developed to withstand temperatures 20 times greater than the Sun's core

     temperature. An example is the Joint European Torus (JET) shown in Figure 10.25. A great deal of work still

     has to be done on fusion reactor technology, but many scientists predict that fusion energy will power the

     world's cities by the end of the twentieth century.

Nuclear physics is an integral part of our everyday lives (Figure 10.26). Radioactive compounds are used to
identify cancer, study ancient artifacts, and power our cities. Nuclear fusion also powers the Sun, the primary
source of energy on Earth. The focus of this chapter is nuclear radiation. In this section, we ask such questions
as: How is nuclear radiation used to benefit society? What are its health risks? How much nuclear radiation is
the average person exposed to in a lifetime?

     mummy. The origin of this radiation is the transformation of one nucleus to another. (credit: Samantha A. Lewis, U.S. Navy)

     Medical Applications

     Medical use of nuclear radiation is quite common in today's hospitals and clinics. One of the most important
     uses of nuclear radiation is the location and study of diseased tissue. This application requires a special drug
     called a radiopharmaceutical. A radiopharmaceutical contains an unstable radioactive isotope. When the
     drug enters the body, it tends to concentrate in inflamed regions of the body. (Recall that the interaction of the
     drug with the body does not depend on whether a given nucleus is replaced by one of its isotopes, since this
     interaction is determined by chemical interactions.) Radiation detectors used outside the body use nuclear
     radiation from the radioisotopes to locate the diseased tissue. Radiopharmaceuticals are called radioactive
     tags because they allow doctors to track the movement of drugs in the body. Radioactive tags are for many
     purposes, including the identification of cancer cells in the bones, brain tumors, and Alzheimer's disease
     (Figure 10.27). Radioactive tags are also used to monitor the function of body organs, such as blood flow, heart
     muscle activity, and iodine uptake in the thyroid gland.

metabolic activity (a larger fraction of red and orange areas). (credit: modification of works by National Institutes of Health)

Table 10.2 lists some medical diagnostic uses of radiopharmaceuticals, including isotopes and typical activity

(A) levels. One common diagnostic test uses iodine to image the thyroid, since iodine is concentrated in that

organ. Another common nuclear diagnostic is the thallium scan for the cardiovascular system, which reveals

blockages in the coronary arteries and examines heart activity. The salt TlCl can be used because it acts like

NaCl and follows the blood. Note that Table 10.2 lists many diagnostic uses for  , where "m" stands for a

metastable state of the technetium nucleus. This isotope is used in many compounds to image the skeleton,

heart, lungs, and kidneys. About of all radiopharmaceuticals employ              because it produces a single,

easily identified, 0.142-MeV ray and has a short 6.0-h half-life, which reduces radiation exposure.

Table 10.2 Diagnostic Uses of Radiopharmaceuticals

The first radiation detectors produced two-dimensional images, like a photo taken from a camera. However, a
circular array of detectors that can be rotated can be used to produce three-dimensional images. This
technique is similar to that used in X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. One application of this technique
is called single-photon-emission CT (SPECT) (Figure 10.28). The spatial resolution of this technique is about
1 cm.

     advantage of the physics of nuclear beat decays and electron-positron collisions. (credit: "Woldo"/Wikimedia Commons)

     Improved image resolution is achieved by a technique known as positron emission tomography (PET). This
     technique use radioisotopes that decay by radiation. When a positron encounters an electron, these
     particle annihilate to produce two gamma-ray photons. This reaction is represented by

     These -ray photons have identical 0.511-MeV energies and move directly away from one another (Figure

     10.29). This easily identified decay signature can be used to identify the location of the radioactive isotope.

     Examples of -emitting isotopes used in PET include  . The nuclei have the advantage

     of being able to function as tags for natural body compounds. Its resolution of 0.5 cm is better than that of

   Biological Effects

     Nuclear radiation can have both positive and negative effects on biological systems. However, it can also be
     used to treat and even cure cancer. How do we understand these effects? To answer this question, consider
     molecules within cells, particularly DNA molecules.

     Cells have long, double-helical DNA molecules containing chemical codes that govern the function and
     processes of the cell. Nuclear radiation can alter the structural features of the DNA chain, leading to changes in
     the genetic code. In human cells, we can have as many as a million individual instances of damage to DNA per
     cell per day. DNA contains codes that check whether the DNA is damaged and can repair itself. This repair
     ability of DNA is vital for maintaining the integrity of the genetic code and for the normal functioning of the
     entire organism. It should be constantly active and needs to respond rapidly. The rate of DNA repair depends
     on various factors such as the type and age of the cell. If nuclear radiation damages the ability of the cell to
     repair DNA, the cell can

1. Retreat to an irreversible state of dormancy (known as senescence);
2. Commit suicide (known as programmed cell death); or
3. Progress into unregulated cell division, possibly leading to tumors and cancers.

     Nuclear radiation can harm the human body is many other ways as well. For example, high doses of nuclear
     radiation can cause burns and even hair loss.

     Biological effects of nuclear radiation are expressed by many different physical quantities and in many
     different units. A common unit to express the biological effects of nuclear radiation is the rad or radiation
     dose unit. One rad is equal to 1/100 of a joule of nuclear energy deposited per kilogram of tissue, written:

For example, if a 50.0-kg person is exposed to nuclear radiation over her entire body and she absorbs 1.00 J,
then her whole-body radiation dose is

Nuclear radiation damages cells by ionizing atoms in the cells as they pass through the cells (Figure 10.30).
The effects of ionizing radiation depend on the dose in rads, but also on the type of radiation (alpha, beta,
gamma, or X-ray) and the type of tissue. For example, if the range of the radiation is small, as it is for rays,
then the ionization and the damage created is more concentrated and harder for the organism to repair. To
account for such affects, we define the relative biological effectiveness (RBE). Sample RBE values for several
types of ionizing nuclear radiation are given in Table 10.3.
480  10 · Nuclear Physics

     Figure 10.30 The image shows ionization created in cells by and radiation. Because of its shorter range, the ionization and damage
     created by rays is more concentrated and harder for the organism to repair. Thus, the RBE for rays is greater than the RBE for rays,
     even though they create the same amount of ionization at the same energy.

     A dose unit more closely related to effects in biological tissue is called the roentgen equivalent man (rem) and

     is defined to be the dose (in rads) multiplied by the relative biological effectiveness (RBE). Thus, if a person had

     a whole-body dose of 2.00 rad of radiation, the dose in rem would be  rem for the whole

     body. If the person had a whole-body dose of 2.00 rad of radiation, then the dose in rem would be

                           rem for the whole body. The rays would have 20 times the effect on the person than the

     rays for the same deposited energy. The SI equivalent of the rem, and the more standard term, is the sievert

     The RBEs given in Table 10.3 are approximate but reflect an understanding of nuclear radiation and its
     interaction with living tissue. For example, neutrons are known to cause more damage than rays, although
     both are neutral and have large ranges, due to secondary radiation. Any dose less than 100 mSv (10 rem) is
     called a low dose, 0.1 Sv to 1 Sv (10 to 100 rem) is called a moderate dose, and anything greater than 1 Sv (100

clue that a person has been exposed to radiation is a change in blood count, which is not surprising since
blood cells are the most rapidly reproducing cells in the body. At higher doses, nausea and hair loss are
observed, which may be due to interference with cell reproduction. Cells in the lining of the digestive system
also rapidly reproduce, and their destruction causes nausea. When the growth of hair cells slows, the hair
follicles become thin and break off. High doses cause significant cell death in all systems, but the lowest doses

Sources of Radiation

Human are also exposed to many sources of nuclear radiation. A summary of average radiation doses for
different sources by country is given in Table 10.5. Earth emits radiation due to the isotopes of uranium,
thorium, and potassium. Radiation levels from these sources depend on location and can vary by a factor of 10.
Fertilizers contain isotopes of potassium and uranium, which we digest in the food we eat. Fertilizers have
more than 3000 Bq/kg radioactivity, compared to just 66 Bq/kg for Carbon-14.

     Medical visits are also a source of nuclear radiation. A sample of common nuclear radiation doses is given in
     Table 10.6. These doses are generally low and can be lowered further with improved techniques and more
     sensitive detectors. With the possible exception of routine dental X-rays, medical use of nuclear radiation is
     used only when the risk-benefit is favorable. Chest X-rays give the lowest doses--about 0.1 mSv to the tissue
     affected, with less than scattering into tissues that are not directly imaged. Other X-ray procedures range
     upward to about 10 mSv in a CT scan, and about 5 mSv (0.5 rem) per dental X-ray, again both only affecting the
     tissue imaged. Medical images with radiopharmaceuticals give doses ranging from 1 to 5 mSv, usually
     localized.

The mass of   involved in the Chernobyl accident is a small material compared to the typical amount of

fuel used in a nuclear reactor. However, approximately 250 people were admitted to local hospitals

immediately after the accident, and diagnosed as suffering acute radiation syndrome. They received external

radiation dosages between 1 and 16 Sv. Referring to biological effects in Table 10.4, these dosages are

extremely hazardous. The eventual death toll is estimated to be around 4000 people, primarily due to

radiation-induced cancer.

chapter we examine some of the frontiers of research at these extreme scales. Particle physics deals with the
most basic building blocks of matter and the forces that hold them together. Cosmology is the study of the

     evolution.

     These two areas of physics are not as disconnected as you might think. The study of elementary particles
     requires enormous energies to produce isolated particles, involving some of the largest machines humans
     have ever built. But such high energies were present in the earliest stages of the universe and the universe we
     see around us today was shaped in part by the nature and interactions of the elementary particles created
     then. Bear in mind that particle physics and cosmology are both areas of intense current research, subject to
     much speculation on the part of physicists (as well science-fiction writers). In this chapter we try to emphasize
     what is known on the basis of deductions from observational evidence, and identify ideas that are conjectured
     but still unproven.

     11.1 Introduction to Particle Physics

     Learning Objectives
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Describe the four fundamental forces and what particles participate in them
      · Identify and describe fermions and bosons
      · Identify and describe the quark and lepton families
      · Distinguish between particles and antiparticles, and describe their interactions

     Elementary particle physics is the study of fundamental particles and their interactions in nature. Those who
     study elementary particle physics--the particle physicists--differ from other physicists in the scale of the
     systems that they study. A particle physicist is not content to study the microscopic world of cells, molecules,
     atoms, or even atomic nuclei. They are interested in physical processes that occur at scales even smaller than
     atomic nuclei. At the same time, they engage the most profound mysteries in nature: How did the universe
     begin? What explains the pattern of masses in the universe? Why is there more matter than antimatter in the
     universe? Why are energy and momentum conserved? How will the universe evolve?

     Four Fundamental Forces

     An important step to answering these questions is to understand particles and their interactions. Particle
     interactions are expressed in terms of four fundamental forces. In order of decreasing strength, these forces
     are the strong nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force, and the gravitational force.

     1. Strong nuclear force. The strong nuclear force is a very strong attractive force that acts only over very short

     distances (about  ). The strong nuclear force is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together

     in atomic nuclei. Not all particles participate in the strong nuclear force; for instance, electrons and neutrinos

     are not affected by it. As the name suggests, this force is much stronger than the other forces.

     2. Electromagnetic force. The electromagnetic force can act over very large distances (it has an infinite range)

     but is only 1/100 the strength of the strong nuclear force. Particles that interact through this force are said to

     have "charge." In the classical theory of static electricity (Coulomb's law), the electric force varies as the

     product of the charges of the interacting particles, and as the inverse square of the distances between them. In

     contrast to the strong force, the electromagnetic force can be attractive or repulsive (opposite charges attract

     and like charges repel). The magnetic force depends in a more complicated way on the charges and their

     motions. The unification of the electric and magnetic force into a single electromagnetic force (an achievement

     of James Clerk Maxwell) stands as one of the greatest intellectual achievements of the nineteenth century. This

     force is central to scientific models of atomic structure and molecular bonding.

     3. Weak nuclear force. The weak nuclear force acts over very short distances      and, as its name

     suggest, is very weak. It is roughly  the strength of the strong nuclear force. This force is manifested most

     notably in decays of elementary particles and neutrino interactions. For example, the neutron can decay to a

     proton, electron, and electron neutrino through the weak force. The weak force is vitally important because it

     is essential for understanding stellar nucleosynthesis--the process that creates new atomic nuclei in the cores

     of stars.

     4. Gravitational force. Like the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force can act over infinitely large

     distances; however, it is only        as strong as the strong nuclear force. In Newton's classical theory of

     gravity, the force of gravity varies as the product of the masses of the interacting particles and as the inverse

square of the distance between them. This force is an attractive force that acts between all particles with mass.
In modern theories of gravity, this force behavior is considered a special case for low-energy macroscopic
interactions. Compared with the other forces of nature, gravity is by far the weakest.

The fundamental forces may not be truly "fundamental" but may actually be different aspects of the same
force. Just as the electric and magnetic forces were unified into an electromagnetic force, physicists in the
1970s unified the electromagnetic force with the weak nuclear force into an electroweak force. Any scientific
theory that attempts to unify the electroweak force and strong nuclear force is called a grand unified theory,
and any theory that attempts to unify all four forces is called a theory of everything. We will return to the
concept of unification later in this chapter.

Classifications of Elementary Particles

A large number of subatomic particles exist in nature. These particles can be classified in two ways: the
property of spin and participation in the four fundamental forces. Recall that the spin of a particle is analogous
to the rotation of a macroscopic object about its own axis. These types of classification are described
separately below.

Classification by spin
Particles of matter can be divided into fermions and bosons. Fermions have half-integral spin  

and bosons have integral spin         Familiar examples of fermions are electrons, protons, and

neutrons. A familiar example of a boson is a photon. Fermions and bosons behave very differently in groups.
For example, when electrons are confined to a small region of space, Pauli's exclusion principle states that no
two electrons can occupy the same quantum-mechanical state. However, when photons are confined to a small
region of space, there is no such limitation.

The behavior of fermions and bosons in groups can be understood in terms of the property of
indistinguishability. Particles are said to be "indistinguishable" if they are identical to one another. For
example, electrons are indistinguishable because every electron in the universe has exactly the same mass
and spin as all other electrons--"when you've seen one electron, you've seen them all." If you switch two
indistinguishable particles in the same small region of space, the square of the wave function that describes

this system and can be measured  is unchanged. If this were not the case, we could tell whether or not

the particles had been switched and the particle would not be truly indistinguishable. Fermions and bosons
differ by whether the sign of the wave function ( )-- not directly observable--flips:

Fermions are said to be "antisymmetric on exchange" and bosons are "symmetric on exchange." Pauli's
exclusion principle is a consequence of exchange symmetry of fermions--a connection developed in a more
advanced course in modern physics. The electronic structure of atoms is predicated on Pauli's exclusion
principle and is therefore directly related to the indistinguishability of electrons.

Classification by force interactions

Fermions can be further divided into quarks and leptons. The primary difference between these two types of

particles is that quarks interact via the strong force and leptons do not. Quarks and leptons (as well as bosons

to be discussed later) are organized in Figure 11.2. The upper two rows (first three columns in purple) contain

six quarks. These quarks are arranged into two particle families: up, charm, and top (u, c, t), and down,

strange, and bottom (d, s, b). Members of the same particle family share the same properties but differ in mass

(given in       ). For example, the mass of the top quark is much greater than the charm quark, and the mass

of the charm quark is much greater than the up quark. All quarks interact with one another through the strong

nuclear force.

     Ordinary matter consists of two types of quarks: the up quark (elementary charge,  ) and the down

     quark            Heavier quarks are unstable and quickly decay to lighter ones via the weak force. Quarks

     bind together in groups of twos and threes called hadrons via the strong force. Hadrons that consist of two

     quarks are called mesons, and those that consist of three quarks are called baryons. Examples of mesons

     include the pion and kaon, and examples of baryons include the familiar proton and neutron. A proton is two

     up quarks and a down quark           and a neutron is one up quark and two down quarks (                        ,

     ). Properties of sample mesons and baryons are given in Table 11.1. Quarks participate in all four

     fundamental forces: strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational.

     The lower two rows in the figure (in green) contain six leptons arranged into two particle families: electron,

     muon, and tau (  ), and electron neutrino, muon neutrino, and tau neutrino (       ). The muon is over

     200 times heavier than an electron, but is otherwise similar to the electron. The tau is about 3500 times

     heavier than the electron, but is otherwise similar to the muon and electron. Once created, the muon and tau

     quickly decay to lighter particles via the weak force. Leptons do not participate in the strong force. Quarks and

     leptons will be discussed later in this chapter. Leptons participate in the weak, electromagnetic, and

     gravitational forces, but do not participate in the strong force.

     Bosons (shown in red) are the force carriers of the fermions. In this model, leptons and quarks interact with
     each other by sending and receiving bosons. For example, Coulombic interaction occurs when two positively
     charged particles send and receive (exchange) photons. The photons are said to "carry" the force between
     charged particles. Likewise, attraction between two quarks in an atomic nucleus occurs when two quarks send
     and receive gluons. Additional examples include W and Z bosons (which carry weak nuclear force) and
     gravitons (which carry gravitational force). The Higgs boson is a special particle: When it interacts with other
     particles, it endows them not with force but with mass. In other words, the Higgs boson helps to explains why
     particles have mass. These assertions are part of a tentative but very productive scientific model (the Standard
     Model) discussed later.

     Particles and Antiparticles

     In the late 1920s, the special theory of relativity and quantum mechanics were combined into a relativistic
     quantum theory of the electron. A surprising result of this theory was the prediction of two energy states for

each electron: One is associated with the electron, and the other is associated with another particle with the
same mass of an electron but with a charge of . This particle is called the antielectron or positron. The
positron was discovered experimentally in the 1930s.

Soon it was discovered that for every particle in nature, there is a corresponding antiparticle. An antiparticle
has the same mass and lifetime as its associated particle, and the opposite sign of electric charge. These
particles are produced in high-energy reactions. Examples of high-energy particles include the antimuon ( ),

anti-up quark ( ), and anti-down quark (Note that antiparticles for quarks are designated with an over-

bar.) Many mesons and baryons contain antiparticles. For example, the antiproton ( ) is and the positively

charged pion  is . Some neutral particles, such as the photon and the meson, are their own

antiparticles. Sample particles, antiparticles, and their properties are listed in Table 11.1.

     The same forces that hold ordinary matter together also hold antimatter together. Under the right conditions, it
     is possible to create antiatoms such as antihydrogen, antioxygen, and even antiwater. In antiatoms, positrons
     orbit a negatively charged nucleus of antiprotons and antineutrons. Figure 11.3 compares atoms and
     antiatoms.

     positron that orbits an antiproton. (b) An antihelium atom consists of two positrons that orbit a nucleus of two antiprotons and two
     antineutrons.

     Antimatter cannot exist for long in nature because particles and antiparticles annihilate each other to produce
     high-energy radiation. A common example is electron-positron annihilation. This process proceeds by the
     reaction

     The electron and positron vanish completely and two photons are produced in their place. (It turns out that the
     production of a single photon would violate conservation of energy and momentum.) This reaction can also
     proceed in the reverse direction: Two photons can annihilate each other to produce an electron and positron
     pair. Or, a single photon can produce an electron-positron pair in the field of a nucleus, a process called pair
     production. Reactions of this kind are measured routinely in modern particle detectors. The existence of
     antiparticles in nature is not science fiction.

11.2 Particle Conservation Laws

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Distinguish three conservation laws: baryon number, lepton number, and strangeness
 · Use rules to determine the total baryon number, lepton number, and strangeness of particles before and

      after a reaction
 · Use baryon number, lepton number, and strangeness conservation to determine if particle reactions or

      decays occur

Conservation laws are critical to an understanding of particle physics. Strong evidence exists that energy,

momentum, and angular momentum are all conserved in all particle interactions. The annihilation of an

electron and positron at rest, for example, cannot produce just one photon because this violates the

conservation of linear momentum. As discussed in Relativity, the special theory of relativity modifies

definitions of momentum, energy, and other familiar quantities. In particular, the relativistic momentum of a

particle differs from its classical momentum by a factor              that varies from 1 to  depending

on the speed of the particle.

In previous chapters, we encountered other conservation laws as well. For example, charge is conserved in all
electrostatic phenomena. Charge lost in one place is gained in another because charge is carried by particles.
No known physical processes violate charge conservation. In the next section, we describe three less-familiar
conservation laws: baryon number, lepton number, and strangeness. These are by no means the only
conservation laws in particle physics.

Baryon Number Conservation

No conservation law considered thus far prevents a neutron from decaying via a reaction such as

This process conserves charge, energy, and momentum. However, it does not occur because it violates the law

of baryon number conservation. This law requires that the total baryon number of a reaction is the same

before and after the reaction occurs. To determine the total baryon number, every elementary particle is

assigned a baryon number B. The baryon number has the value           for baryons, -1 for antibaryons, and 0

for all other particles. Returning to the above case (the decay of the neutron into an electron-positron pair), the

neutron has a value            whereas the electron and the positron each has a value of 0. Thus, the decay does

not occur because the total baryon number changes from 1 to 0. However, the proton-antiproton collision

process

does satisfy the law of conservation of baryon number because the baryon number is zero before and after the
interaction. The baryon number for several common particles is given in Table 11.2.

Determine the total baryon number for the reactants and products, and require that this value does not change
in the reaction. Solution

For reaction (a), the net baryon number of the two reactants is          and the net baryon number of the

four products is                   Since the net baryon numbers of the reactants and products are equal, this

reaction is allowed on the basis of the baryon number conservation law.

For reaction (b), the net baryon number of the reactants is              and the net baryon number of the

proposed products is               Since the net baryon numbers of the reactants and proposed products

are not equal, this reaction cannot occur.

Significance

Lepton Number Conservation

Lepton number conservation states that the sum of lepton numbers before and after the interaction must be

the same. There are three different lepton numbers: the electron-lepton number the muon-lepton

number and the tau-lepton number In any interaction, each of these quantities must be conserved

separately. For electrons and electron neutrinos,        for their antiparticles,         all other particles

have       Similarly,              for muons and muon neutrinos,         for their antiparticles, and

for all other particles. Finally,           , or 0, depending on whether we have a tau or tau neutrino, their

antiparticles, or any other particle, respectively. Lepton number conservation guarantees that the number of

electrons and positrons in the universe stays relatively constant. (Note: The total lepton number is, as far as we

know, conserved in nature. However, observations have shown variations of family lepton number (for

example, in a phenomenon called neutrino oscillations.)

To illustrate the lepton number conservation law, consider the following known two-step decay process:

In the first decay, all of the lepton numbers for are 0. For the products of this decay,  for and

the net muon-lepton number of the decay products is                      . Thus, the muon-lepton number is

conserved. Electron-lepton number is also conserved, as           for , whereas the net electron-lepton

number of the decay products is                    . Finally, since no taus or tau-neutrinos are involved in this

decay, the tau-lepton number is also conserved.

     Strangeness Conservation

     In the late 1940s and early 1950s, cosmic-ray experiments revealed the existence of particles that had never

     been observed on Earth. These particles were produced in collisions of pions with protons or neutrons in the

     atmosphere. Their production and decay were unusual. They were produced in the strong nuclear interactions

     of pions and nucleons, and were therefore inferred to be hadrons; however, their decay was mediated by the

     much more slowly acting weak nuclear interaction. Their lifetimes were on the order of       to

     whereas a typical lifetime for a particle that decays via the strong nuclear reaction is     These particles

     were also unusual because they were always produced in pairs in the pion-nucleon collisions. For these

conserved in strong interactions but not in weak interactions. This property is called strangeness and, as the
name suggests, is associated with the presence of a strange quark. The strangeness of a particle is equal to the
number of strange quarks of the particle. Strangeness conservation requires the total strangeness of a reaction
or decay (summing the strangeness of all the particles) is the same before and after the interaction.
Strangeness conservation is not absolute: It is conserved in strong interactions and electromagnetic
interactions but not in weak interactions. The strangeness number for several common particles is given in
Table 11.2.

Strangeness Conservation

(a) Based on the conservation of strangeness, can the following reaction occur?

(b) The following decay is mediated by the weak nuclear force:

Does the decay conserve strangeness? If not, can the decay occur?
Strategy
Determine the strangeness of the reactants and products and require that this value does not change in the
reaction.
504  11 · Particle Physics and Cosmology

     Solution

     a. The net strangeness of the reactants is       and the net strangeness of the products is

                          Thus, the strong nuclear interaction between a pion and a proton is not forbidden by the

     law of conservation of strangeness. Notice that baryon number is also conserved in the reaction.

     b. The net strangeness before and after this decay is 1 and 0, so the decay does not conserve strangeness.

     However, the decay may still be possible, because the law of conservation of strangeness does not apply to

     weak decays.

     Significance
     Strangeness is conserved in the first reaction, but not in the second. Strangeness conservation constrains what
     reactions can and cannot occur in nature.

      · Compare and contrast the six known quarks
      · Use quark composition of hadrons to determine the total charge of these particles
      · Explain the primary evidence for the existence of quarks

     In the 1960s, particle physicists began to realize that hadrons are not elementary particles but are made of
     particles called quarks. (The name `quark' was coined by the physicist Murray Gell-Mann, from a phrase in the
     James Joyce novel Finnegans Wake.) Initially, it was believed there were only three types of quarks, called up
     (u), down (d), and strange (s). However, this number soon grew to six--interestingly, the same as the number of
     leptons--to include charmed (c), bottom (b), and top (t).

     All quarks are spin-half fermions           have a fractional charge     , and have baryon number

               Each quark has an antiquark with the same mass but opposite charge and baryon number. The

Interestingly, the delta plus ( ) baryon is formed from the same three quarks as the proton, but the total spin
of the particle is 3/2 rather than 1/2. Similarly, the mass of with spin 3/2 is 1.3 times the mass of the
proton, and the delta zero ( ) baryon with a spin 3/2 is 1.3 times the neutron mass. Evidently, the energy
associated with the spin (or angular momentum) of the particle contributes to its mass energy. It is also
interesting that no baryons are believed to exist with top quarks, because top quarks decay too quickly to bind
to the other quarks in their production.

     Solution

     The charge of the s quark is         and the charge of the u quark is 2e/3. Thus, the combination (s u s) has no net

     charge, in agreement with the known charge of . Since three spin  quarks can combine to produce a

     particle with spin of either 1/2 or 3/2, the quark composition is consistent with the known spin (  ) of .

     Finally, the net strangeness of the (s u s) combination is           which also agrees with

     Significance

     The charge, spin, and strangeness of the particle can be determined from the properties of its constituent

     charge, strange, top, and bottom.

          Table 11.5 Meson Quarks

Color

Quarks are fermions that obey Pauli's exclusion principle, so it might be surprising to learn that three quarks
can bind together within a nucleus. For example, how can two up quarks exist in the same small region of
space within a proton? The solution is to invent a third new property to distinguish them. This property is
called color, and it plays the same role in the strong nuclear interaction as charge does in electromagnetic
interactions. For this reason, quark color is sometimes called "strong charge."

Quarks come in three colors: red, green, and blue. (These are just labels--quarks are not actually colored.)

Each type of quark        can possess any other colors. For example, three strange quarks exist: a red

strange quark, a green strange quark, and a blue strange quark. Antiquarks have anticolor. Quarks that bind

together to form hadrons (baryons and mesons) must be color neutral, colorless, or "white." Thus, a baryon

must contain a red, blue, and green quark. Likewise, a meson contains either a red-antired, blue-antiblue, or

green-antigreen quark pair. Thus, two quarks can be found in the same spin state in a hadron, without

violating Pauli's exclusion principle, because their colors are different.

Quark Confinement

The first strong evidence for the existence of quarks came from a series of experiments performed at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and at CERN around 1970. This experiment was designed to probe
the structure of the proton, much like Rutherford studied structure inside the atom with his -particle
scattering experiments. Electrons were collided with protons with energy in excess of 20 GeV. At this energy,

          , so the de Broglie wavelength of an electron is

                                                                                                       11.1

The wavelength of the electron is much smaller than the diameter of the proton (about  Thus, like an

automobile traveling through a rocky mountain range, electrons can be used to probe the structure of the

nucleus.

The SLAC experiments found that some electrons were deflected at very large angles, indicating small

scattering centers within the proton. The scattering distribution was consistent with electrons being scattered

from sites with spin 1/2, the spin of quarks. The experiments at CERN used neutrinos instead of electrons. This

experiment also found evidence for the tiny scattering centers. In both experiments, the results suggested that

the charges of the scattering particles were either  or     , in agreement with the quark model.

     The quark model has been extremely successful in organizing the complex world of subatomic particles.
     Interestingly, however, no experiment has ever produced an isolated quark. All quarks have fractional charge
     and should therefore be easily distinguishable from the known elementary particles, whose charges are all an
     integer multiple of e. Why are isolated quarks not observed? In current models of particle interactions, the
     answer is expressed in terms of quark confinement. Quark confinement refers to the confinement of quarks in
     groups of two or three in a small region of space. The quarks are completely free to move about in this space,
     and send and receive gluons (the carriers of the strong force). However, if these quarks stray too far from one
     another, the strong force pulls them back it. This action is likened to a bola, a weapon used for hunting (Figure
     11.5). The stones are tied to a central point by a string, so none of the rocks can move too far from the others.
     The bola corresponds to a baryon, the stones correspond to quarks, and the string corresponds to the gluons
     that hold the system together.

     Figure 11.5 A baryon is analogous to a bola, a weapon used for hunting. The rocks in this image correspond to the baryon quarks. The
     quarks are free to move about but must remain close to the other quarks.

      · Use the curvature of a charge track to determine the momentum of a particle

     The goal of experimental particle physics is to accurately measure elementary particles. The primary method
     used to achieve this end is to produce these particles in high-energy collisions and then measure the products
     of using highly sensitive particle detectors. These experiments are used to test and revise scientific models of
     particle interactions. The purpose of this section is to describe particle accelerators and detectors. Modern
     machines are based on earlier ones, so it is helpful to present a brief history of accelerators and detectors.

     Early Particle Accelerators

     A particle accelerator is a machine designed to accelerate charged particles. This acceleration is usually
     achieved with strong electric fields, magnetic fields, or both. A simple example of a particle accelerator is the
     Van de Graaff accelerator (see Electric Potential). This type of accelerator collects charges on a hollow metal

                                                             11.4 · Particle Accelerators and Detectors                                     509

sphere using a moving belt. When the electrostatic potential difference of the sphere is sufficiently large, the
field is used to accelerate particles through an evacuated tube. Energies produced by a Van de Graaff
accelerator are not large enough to create new particles, but the machine was important for early exploration
of the atomic nucleus.

Larger energies can be produced by a linear accelerator (called a "linac"). Charged particles produced at the
beginning of the linac are accelerated by a continuous line of charged hollow tubes. The voltage between a
given pair of tubes is set to draw the charged particle in, and once the particle arrives, the voltage between the
next pair of tubes is set to push the charged particle out. In other words, voltages are applied in such a way that
the tubes deliver a series of carefully synchronized electric kicks (Figure 11.6). Modern linacs employ radio
frequency (RF) cavities that set up oscillating electromagnetic fields, which propel the particle forward like a
surfer on an ocean wave. Linacs can accelerate electrons to over 100 MeV. (Electrons with kinetic energies
greater than 2 MeV are moving very close to the speed of light.) In modern particle research, linear
accelerators are often used in the first stage of acceleration.

Figure 11.6 In a linear accelerator, charged tubes accelerate particles in a series of electromagnetic kicks. Each tube is longer than the
preceding tube because the particle is moving faster as it accelerates.

EXAMPLE 11.5

Accelerating Tubes

A linear accelerator designed to produce a beam of 800-MeV protons has 2000 accelerating tubes separated by
gaps. What average voltage must be applied between tubes to achieve the desired energy? (Hint:

the potential difference (voltage) across the gap. Since

                                                  the proton gains 1 eV in energy for each volt across the gap that it passes
     through. The ac voltage applied to the tubes is timed so that it adds to the energy in each gap. The effective
     voltage is the sum of the gap voltages and equals 800 MV to give each proton an energy of 800 MeV.

     Solution
     There are 2000 gaps and the sum of the voltages across them is 800 MV. Therefore, the average voltage applied
     is 0.4 MV or 400 kV.

     Significance
     A voltage of this magnitude is not difficult to achieve in a vacuum. Much larger gap voltages would be required
     for higher energy, such as those at the 50-GeV SLAC facility. Synchrotrons are aided by the circular path of the
     accelerated particles, which can orbit many times, effectively multiplying the number of accelerations by the
     number of orbits. This makes it possible to reach energies greater than 1 TeV.

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 11.5

     How much energy does an electron receive in accelerating through a 1-V potential difference?

     The next-generation accelerator after the linac is the cyclotron (Figure 11.7). A cyclotron uses alternating
     electric fields and fixed magnets to accelerate particles in a circular spiral path. A particle at the center of the
     cyclotron is first accelerated by an electric field in a gap between two D-shaped magnets (Dees). As the particle
     crosses over the D-shaped magnet, the particle is bent into a circular path by a Lorentz force. (The Lorentz
     force was discussed in Magnetic Forces and Fields.) Assuming no energy losses, the momentum of the particle
     is related to its radius of curvature by

                                                                                                                                                          11.2

     where p is the momentum in GeV/c, B is in teslas, and r is the radius of the trajectory ("orbit") in meters. This
     expression is valid to classical and relativistic velocities. The circular trajectory returns the particle to the
     electric field gap, the electric field is reversed, and the process continues. As the particle is accelerated, the
     radius of curvature gets larger and larger--spirally outward--until the electrons leave the device.

     Figure 11.7 Cyclotrons use a magnetic field to cause particles to move in circular orbits. As the particles pass between the plates of the
     "Dees," the voltage across the gap is reversed so the particles are accelerated twice in each orbit.

name. Steering high-energy particles requires strong magnetic fields, so superconducting magnets are often
used to reduce heat losses. As the charged particles move in a circle, they radiate energy: According to classical
theory, any charged particle that accelerates (and circular motion is an accelerated motion) also radiates. In a
synchrotron, such radiation is called synchrotron radiation. This radiation is useful for many other purposes,
such as medical and materials research.

        EXAMPLE 11.6

The Energy of an Electron in a Cyclotron

An electron is accelerated using a cyclotron. If the magnetic field is 1.5 T and the radius of the "Dees" is 1.2 m,
what is the kinetic energy of the outgoing particle?

Strategy
If the radius of orbit of the electron exceeds the radius of the "Dees," the electron exits the device. So, the radius
of the "Dees" places an upper limit on the radius and, therefore, the momentum and energy of the accelerated
particle. The exit momentum of the particle is determined using the radius of orbit and strength of the
magnetic field. The exit energy of the particle can be determined the particle momentum (Relativity).

Solution
Assuming no energy losses, the momentum of the particle in the cyclotron is

The momentum energy              is much larger than the rest mass energy of the electron,

so relativistic expression for the energy of the electron must be used (see Relativity). The

total energy of the electron is

Significance
The total energy of the electron is much larger than its rest mass energy. In other words, the total energy of the
electron is almost all in the form of kinetic energy. Cyclotrons can be used to conduct nuclear physics
experiments or in particle therapy to treat cancer.

the magnetic field is doubled?

Colliding Beam Machines

New particles can be created by colliding particles at high energies. According to Einstein's mass-energy
relation, the energies of the colliding particles are converted into mass energy of the created particle. The most
efficient way to do this is with particle-colliding beam machines. A colliding beam machine creates two
counter-rotating beams in a circular accelerator, stores the beams at constant energy, and then at the desired
moment, focuses the beams on one another at the center of a sensitive detector.

The prototypical colliding beam machine is the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, located in Ithaca, New York
(Figure 11.8). Electrons ( ) and positrons ( ) are created at the beginning of the linear accelerator and are
accelerated up to 150 MeV. The particles are then injected into the inner synchrotron ring, where they are
accelerated by RF cavities to 4.5 to 6 GeV. When the beams are up to speed, they are transferred and "stored"
in an outer storage ring at the same energy. The two counter-rotating beams travel through the same
512  11 · Particle Physics and Cosmology

     evacuated pipe, but are kept apart until collisions are desired. The electrons and positrons circle the machine
     in bunches 390,000 times every second.

     Figure 11.8 The Cornell Electron Storage Ring uses a linear accelerator and a synchrotron to accelerate electrons and positrons to 4.5-6
     GeV. The particles are held in the outer storage ring at that energy until they are made to collide in a particle detector. (credit: modification
     of work by Laboratory of Nuclear Studies, Cornell Electron Storage Ring)

     When an electron and positron collide, they annihilate each other to produce a photon, which exists for too
     short a time to be detected. The photon produces either a lepton pair (e.g., an electron and position, muon or
     antimuon, or tau and antitau) or a quark pair. If quarks are produced, mesons form, such as and These
     mesons are created nearly at rest since the initial total momentum of the electron-positron system is zero.
     Note, mesons cannot be created at just any colliding energy but only at "resonant" energies that correspond to
     the unique masses of the mesons (Table 11.5). The mesons created in this way are highly unstable and decay
     quickly into lighter particles, such as electrons, protons, and photons. The collision "fragments" provide
     valuable information about particle interactions.

     As the field of particle physics advances, colliding beam machines are becoming more powerful. The Large
     Hadron Collider (LHC), currently the largest accelerator in the world, collides protons at beam energies
     exceeding 6 TeV. The center-of-mass energy (W) refers to the total energy available to create new particles in a
     colliding machine, or the total energy of incoming particles in the center-of-mass frame. (The concept of a
     center-of-mass frame of reference is discussed in Linear Momentum and Collisions.) Therefore, the LHC is
     able to produce one or more particles with a total mass exceeding 12 TeV. The center-of-mass energy is given
     by:

                                                                                                                                                          11.3

EXAMPLE 11.7

Creating a New Particle

The mass of the upsilon  meson ( ) is created in a symmetric electron-positron collider. What beam
energy is required?

Strategy

The Particle Data Group (https://openstax.org/l/21particledata) has stated that the rest mass energy of this

meson is approximately 10.58 GeV. The above expression for the center-of-mass energy can be simplified

because a symmetric collider implies     Also, the rest masses of the colliding electrons and positrons

are identical                 and much smaller than the mass of the energy particle created. Thus, the

center-of-mass energy (W) can be expressed completely in terms of the beam energy,

Solution
Based on the above assumptions, we have

The beam energy is therefore

The rest mass energy of the particle created in the collision is equal to the center-of-mass energy, so

Significance
Given the energy scale of this problem, the rest mass energy of the upsilon meson is due almost entirely
due to the initial kinetic energies of the electron and positrons. This meson is highly unstable and quickly
decays to lighter and more stable particles. The existence of the upsilon particle appears as a dramatic
increase of such events at 5.29 GeV.

Why is a symmetric collider "symmetric?"

Higher beam energies require larger accelerators, so modern colliding beam machines are very large. The
LHC, for example, is 17 miles in circumference (Figure 5.27). (In the 1940s, Enrico Fermi envisioned an
accelerator that encircled all of Earth!) An important scientific challenge of the twenty-first century is to
reduce the size of particle accelerators.

Particle Detectors

The purpose of a particle detector is to accurately measure the outcome of collisions created by a particle
accelerator. The detectors are multipurpose. In other words, the detector is divided into many subdetectors,
each designed to measure a different aspect of the collision event. For example, one detector might be
designed to measure photons and another might be designed to measure muons. To illustrate how
subdetectors contribute to an understanding of an entire collision event, we describe the subdetectors of the
Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), which was used to discover the Higgs Boson at the LHC (Figure 11.9).
514  11 · Particle Physics and Cosmology

     Figure 11.9 Compact Muon Solenoid detector. The detector consists of several layers, each responsible for measuring different types of
     particles. (credit: modification of work by David Barney/CERN)

     The beam pipe of the detector is out of (and into) the page at the left. Particles produced by pp collisions (the
     "collision fragments") stream out of the detector in all directions. These particles encounter multiple layers of
     subdetectors. A subdetector is a particle detector within a larger system of detectors designed to measure
     certain types of particles. There are several main types of subdetectors. Tracking devices determine the path
     and therefore momentum of a particle; calorimeters measure a particle's energy; and particle-identification
     detectors determine a particle's identity (mass).
     The first set of subdetectors that particles encounter is the silicon tracking system. This system is designed to
     measure the momentum of charged particles (such as electrons and protons). The detector is bathed in a
     uniform magnetic field, so the charged particles are bent in a circular path by a Lorentz force (as for the
     cyclotron). If the momentum of the particle is large, the radius of the trajectory is large, and the path is almost
     straight. But if the momentum is small, the radius of the trajectory is small, and the path is tightly curved. As
     the particles pass through the detector, they interact with silicon microstrip detectors at multiple points. These
     detectors produce small electrical signals as the charged particles pass near the detector elements. The signals
     are then amplified and recorded. A series of electrical "hits" is used to determine the trajectory of the particle
     in the tracking system. A computer-generated "best fit" to this trajectory gives the track radius and therefore
     the particle momentum. At the LHC, a large number of tracks are recorded for the same collision event. Fits to
     the tracks are shown by the blue and green lines in Figure 11.10.

Beyond the tracking layers is the electromagnetic calorimeter. This detector is made of clear, lead-based
crystals. When electrons interact with the crystals, they radiate high-energy photons. The photons interact
with the crystal to produce electron-positron pairs. Then, these particles radiate more photons. The process
repeats, producing a particle shower (the crystal "glows"). A crude model of this process is as follows.

An electron with energy strikes the crystal and loses half of its energy in the form of a photon. The photon

produces an electron-positron pair, and each particle proceeds away with half the energy of the photon.

Meanwhile, the original electron radiates again. So, we are left with four particles: two electrons, one positron,

and one photon, each with an energy  The number of particles in the shower increases geometrically.

After n radiation events, there are  particles. Hence, the total energy per particle after n radiation

events is

where is the incident energy and E(t) is the amount of energy per particle after n events. An incoming
photon triggers a similar chain of events (Figure 11.11). If the energy per particle drops below a particular
threshold value, other types of radiative processes become important and the particle shower ceases.
Eventually, the total energy of the incoming particle is absorbed and converted into an electrical signal.

Figure 11.11 (a) A particle shower produced in a crystal calorimeter. (b) A diagram showing a typical sequence of reactions in a particle
shower.

Beyond the crystal calorimeter is the hadron calorimeter. As the name suggests, this subdetector measures
516  11 · Particle Physics and Cosmology

     hadrons such as protons and pions. The hadron calorimeter consists of layers of brass and steel separated by
     plastic scintillators. Its purpose is to absorb the particle energy and convert it into an electronic signal. Beyond
     this detector is a large magnetic coil used to produce a uniform field for tracking.

     The last subdetector is the muon detector, which consists of slabs of iron that only muons (and neutrinos) can
     penetrate. Between the iron slabs are multiple types of muon-tracking elements that accurately measure the
     momentum of the muon. The muon detectors are important because the Higgs boson (discussed soon) can be
     detected through its decays to four muons--hence the name of the detector.

     Once data is collected from each of the particle subdetectors, the entire collision event can be assessed. The
     energy of the ith particle is written

     where is the absolute magnitude of the momentum of the ith particle, and  is its rest mass.
     The total energy of all particles is therefore

     If all particles are detected, the total energy should be equal to the center-of-mass energy of the colliding beam
     machine (W). In practice, not all particles are identified, either because these particles are too difficult to
     detect (neutrinos) or because these particles "slip through." In many cases, whole chains of decays can be
     "reconstructed," like putting back together a watch that has been smashed to pieces. Information about these
     decay chains are critical to the evaluation of models of particle interactions.

      · Explain the rationale behind grand unification theories

     The chief intellectual activity of any scientist is the development and revision of scientific models. A particle
     physicist seeks to develop models of particle interactions. This work builds directly on work done on gravity
     and electromagnetism in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. The ultimate goal of physics
     is a unified "theory of everything" that describes all particle interactions in terms of a single elegant equation
     and a picture. The equation itself might be complex, but many scientists suspect the idea behind the equation
     will make us exclaim: "How could we have missed it? It was so obvious!"

     In this section, we introduce the Standard Model, which is the best current model of particle interactions. We
     describe the Standard Model in detail in terms of electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong forces. At the end
     of this section, we review unification theories in particle physics.

     Introduction to the Standard Model

     The Standard Model of particle interactions contains two ideas: electroweak theory and quantum
     chromodynamics (QCD) (the force acting between color charges). Electroweak theory unifies the theory of
     quantum electrodynamics (QED), the modern equivalent of classical electromagnetism, and the theory of
     weak nuclear interactions. The Standard Model combines the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.

     In the Standard Model, particle interactions occur through the exchange of bosons, the "force carriers." For
     example, the electrostatic force is communicated between two positively charged particles by sending and
     receiving massless photons. This can occur at a theoretical infinite range. The result of these interactions is
     Coulomb repulsion (or attraction). Similarly, quarks bind together through the exchange of massless gluons.
     Leptons scatter off other leptons (or decay into lighter particles) through the exchange of massive W and Z

Table 11.6 Four Forces and the Standard Model

The Standard Model can be expressed in terms of equations and diagrams. The equations are complex and are
usually covered in a more advanced course in modern physics. However, the essence of the Standard Model
can be captured using Feynman diagrams. A Feynman diagram, invented by American physicist Richard
Feynman (1918-1988), is a space-time diagram that describes how particles move and interact. Different
symbols are used for different particles. Particle interactions in one dimension are shown as a time-position
graph (not a position-time graph). As an example, consider the scattering of an electron and electron-neutrino
(Figure 11.12). The electron moves toward positive values of x (to the right) and collides with an electron
neutrino moving to the left. The electron exchanges a Z boson (charge zero). The electron scatters to the left
and the neutrino scatters to the right. This exchange is not instantaneous. The Z boson travels from one
particle to the other over a short period of time. The interaction of the electron and neutrino is said to occur via
the weak nuclear force. This force cannot be explained by classical electromagnetism because the charge of
the neutrino is zero. The weak nuclear force is discussed again later in this section.

 Figure 11.12 In this Feynman diagram, the exchange of a virtual carries the weak nuclear force between an electron and a neutrino.

Electromagnetic Force

According to QED, the electromagnetic force is transmitted between charged particles through the exchange of
photons. The theory is based on three basic processes: An electron travels from one place to the next, emits or
absorbs a photon, and travels from one place to another again. When two electrons interact, one electron emits
the photon and the other receives it (Figure 11.13). Photons transfer energy and momentum from one electron
to the other. The net result in this case is a repulsive force. The photons exchanged are virtual. A virtual
518  11 · Particle Physics and Cosmology

     particle is a particle that exists for too short a time to be observable. Since the photon transit time is
     extremely small, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty in the photon's energy,
     may be very large.

                                  Figure 11.13 Feynman diagram of two electrons interacting through the exchange of a photon.  11.4

     To estimate the range of the electromagnetic interaction, assume that the uncertainty on the energy is
     comparable to the energy of the photon itself, written

     The Heisenberg uncertainly principle states that

                                                                                                                               11.5

     Combining these equations, we have

                                                                                                                               11.6

     The energy of a photon is given by          , so

                                                                                                                               11.7

     The distance d that the photon can move in this time is therefore

                                                                                                                               11.8

     The energy of the virtual photon can be arbitrarily small, so its wavelength can be arbitrarily large--in
     principle, even infinitely large. The electromagnetic force is therefore a long-range force.

     Weak Nuclear Force

     The weak nuclear force is responsible for radioactive decay. The range of the weak nuclear force is very short

     (only about  m) and like the other forces in the Standard Model, the weak force can be described in terms

     of particle exchange. (There is no simple function like the Coulomb force to describe these interactions.) The

     particle exchanged is one of three bosons:        and . The Standard Model predicts the existence of

     these spin-1 particles and also predicts their specific masses. In combination with previous experiments, the

     mass of the charged W bosons was predicted to be  and that of the was predicted to be

     . A CERN experiment discovered particles in the 1980s with precisely these masses--an impressive

     victory for the model.

     The weak nuclear force is most frequently associated with scattering and decays of unstable particles to light
     particles. For example, neutrons decay to protons through the weak nuclear force. This reaction is written

     where n is the neutron, p is a proton, is an electron, and is a nearly massless electron neutrino. This
     process, called beta decay, is important in many physical processes. A Feynman diagram of beta decay is given

antineutrino. This process is similar to the scattering event

In this process, the proton emits a and is converted into a neutron (b). The then combines with the
electron, forming a neutrino. Other electroweak interactions are considered in the exercises.

Figure 11.14 Feynman diagram of particles interacting through the exchange of a W boson: (a) beta decay; (b) conversion of a proton into
a neutron.

The range of the weak nuclear force can be estimated with an argument similar to the one before. Assuming

the uncertainty on the energy is comparable to the energy of the exchange particle by  we have

                                                                                                         11.9

The maximum distance d that the exchange particle can travel (assuming it moves at a speed close to c) is
therefore

                                                                                                                                                   11.10

For one of the charged vector bosons with              we obtain

                         Hence, the range of the force mediated by this boson is

                                                                                                         11.11

Strong Nuclear Force

Strong nuclear interactions describe interactions between quarks. Details of these interactions are described

by QCD. According to this theory, quarks bind together by sending and receiving gluons. Just as quarks carry

electric charge [either  or                that determines the strength of electromagnetic interactions

between the quarks, quarks also carry "color charge" (either red, blue, or green) that determines the strength

of strong nuclear interactions. As discussed before, quarks bind together in groups in color neutral (or "white")

combinations, such as red-blue-green and red-antired.

Interestingly, the gluons themselves carry color charge. Eight known gluons exist: six that carry a color and
anticolor, and two that are color neutral (Figure 11.15(a)). To illustrate the interaction between quarks through
the exchange of charged gluons, consider the Feynman diagram in part (b). As time increases, a red down
quark moves right and a green strange quark moves left. (These appear at the lower edge of the graph.) The up
quark exchanges a red-antigreen gluon with the strange quark. (Anticolors are shown as secondary colors. For
example, antired is represented by cyan because cyan mixes with red to form white light.) According to QCD,
all interactions in this process--identified with the vertices--must be color neutral. Therefore, the down quark
transforms from red to green, and the strange quark transforms from green to red.

     interaction between two quarks through the exchange of a gluon.

     As suggested by this example, the interaction between quarks in an atomic nucleus can be very complicated.
     Figure 11.16 shows the interaction between a proton and neutron. Notice that the proton converts into a
     neutron and the neutron converts into a proton during the interaction. The presence of quark-antiquark pairs
     in the exchange suggest that bonding between nucleons can be modeled as an exchange of pions.

     In practice, QCD predictions are difficult to produce. This difficulty arises from the inherent strength of the
     force and the inability to neglect terms in the equations. Thus, QCD calculations are often performed with the
     aid of supercomputers. The existence of gluons is supported by electron-nucleon scattering experiments. The
     estimated quark momenta implied by these scattering events are much smaller than we would expect without
     gluons because the gluons carry away some of the momentum of each collision.

     Unification Theories

     Physicists have long known that the strength of an interaction between particles depends on the distance of
     the interaction. For example, two positively charged particles experience a larger repulsive force at a short

distance then at a long distance. In scattering experiments, the strength of an interaction depends on the
energy of the interacting particle, since larger energy implies both closer and stronger interactions.

Particle physicists now suspect that the strength of all particle interactions (the four forces) merge at high
energies, and the details of particle interactions at these energies can be described in terms of a single force
(Figure 11.17). A unified theory describes what these interactions are like and explains why this description
breaks down at low-energy scales. A grand unified theory is a theory that attempts to describe strong and
electroweak interaction in terms of just one force. A theory of everything (TOE) takes the unification concept
one step further. A TOE combines all four fundamental forces (including gravity) into one theory.

We have been discussing elementary particles, which are some of the smallest things we can study. Now we are
going to examine what we know about the universe, which is the biggest thing we can study. The link between
these two topics is high energy: The study of particle interactions requires very high energies, and the highest
energies we know about existed during the early evolution of the universe. Some physicists think that the
unified force theories we described in the preceding section may actually have governed the behavior of the
universe in its earliest moments.

Hubble's Law

In 1929, Edwin Hubble published one of the most important discoveries in modern astronomy. Hubble
discovered that (1) galaxies appear to move away from Earth and (2) the velocity of recession (v) is proportional
to the distance (d) of the galaxy from Earth. Both v and d can be determined using stellar light spectra. A best
fit to the sample illustrative data is given in Figure 11.18. (Hubble's original plot had a considerable scatter but
a general trend was still evident.)

     Figure 11.18 This graph of red shift versus distance for galaxies shows a linear relationship, with larger red shifts at greater distances,
     implying an expanding universe. The slope gives an approximate value for the expansion rate. (credit: John Cub)

     The trend in the data suggests the simple proportional relationship:

                                                                                                                11.12

     where        is known as Hubble's constant. (Note: 1 Mpc is one megaparsec or one million

     parsecs, where one parsec is 3.26 light-years.) This relationship, called Hubble's law, states that distant stars

     and galaxies recede away from us at a speed of 70 km/s for every one megaparsec of distance from us.

     Hubble's constant corresponds to the slope of the line in Figure 11.18. Hubble's constant is a bit of a misnomer,

     because it varies with time. The value given here is only its value today.

     Hubble's law describes an average behavior of all but the closest galaxies. For example, a galaxy 100 Mpc away
     (as determined by its size and brightness) typically moves away from us at a speed of

     This speed may vary due to interactions with neighboring galaxies. Conversely, if a galaxy is found to be
     moving away from us at speed of 100,000 km/s based on its red shift, it is at a distance

     This last calculation is approximate because it assumes the expansion rate was the same 5 billion years ago as
     it is now.

     Big Bang Model

     Scientists who study the origin, evolution, and ultimate fate of the universe (cosmology) believe that the
     universe began in an explosion, called the Big Bang, approximately 13.7 billion years ago. This explosion was
     not an explosion of particles through space, like fireworks, but a rapid expansion of space itself. The distances
     and velocities of the outward-going stars and galaxies permit us to estimate when all matter in the universe
     was once together--at the beginning of time.

     Scientists often explain the Big Bang expansion using an inflated-balloon model (Figure 11.19). Dots marked
     on the surface of the balloon represent galaxies, and the balloon skin represents four-dimensional space-time
     (Relativity). As the balloon is inflated, every dot "sees" the other dots moving away. This model yields two
     insights. First, the expansion is observed by all observers in the universe, no matter where they are located.
     The "center of expansion" does not exist, so Earth does not reside at the "privileged" center of the expansion
     (see Exercise 11.24).

expansion.

Second, as mentioned already, the Big Bang expansion is due to the expansion of space, not the increased
separation of galaxies in ordinary (static) three-dimensional space. This cosmological expansion affects all
things: dust, stars, planets, and even light. Thus, the wavelength of light emitted by distant galaxies is
"stretched" out. This makes the light appear "redder" (lower energy) to the observer--a phenomenon called
cosmological redshift. Cosmological redshift is measurable only for galaxies farther away than 50 million
light-years.

        EXAMPLE 11.8

Calculating Speeds and Galactic Distances

A galaxy is observed to have a redshift:

This value indicates a galaxy moving close to the speed of light. Using the relativistic redshift formula (given in
Relativity), determine (a) How fast is the galaxy receding with respect to Earth? (b) How far away is the galaxy?
Strategy
We need to use the relativistic Doppler formula to determine speed from redshift and then use Hubble's law to
find the distance from the speed.
Solution
a. According to the relativistic redshift formula:
524  11 · Particle Physics and Cosmology

     where  Substituting the value for z and solving for , we get                  This value implies that the

     speed of the galaxy is               .

     b. Using Hubble's law, we can find the distance to the galaxy if we know its

     recession velocity:

     Significance
     Distant galaxies appear to move very rapidly away from Earth. The redshift of starlight from these galaxies can
     be used to determine the precise speed of recession, over of the speed of light in this case. This motion is
     not due to the motion of galaxy through space but by the expansion of space itself.

     Structure and Dynamics of the Universe

     At large scales, the universe is believed to be both isotropic and homogeneous. The universe is believed to
     isotropic because it appears to be the same in all directions, and homogeneous because it appears to be the
     same in all places. A universe that is isotropic and homogeneous is said to be smooth. The assumption of a
     smooth universe is supported by the Automated Plate Measurement Galaxy Survey conducted in the 1980s
     and 1900s (Figure 11.20). However, even before these data were collected, the assumption of a smooth
     universe was used by theorists to simplify models of the expansion of the universe. This assumption of a
     smooth universe is sometimes called the cosmological principle.

The fate of this expanding and smooth universe is an open question. According to the general theory of
relativity, an important way to characterize the state of the universe is through the space-time metric:

                                                                                                           11.13

where c is the speed of light, a is a scale factor (a function of time), and  is the length element of the space. In

spherical coordinates (  , this length element can be written

                                                                                                           11.14

where k is a constant with units of inverse area that describes the curvature of space. This constant
distinguishes between open, closed, and flat universes:

   ·  (flat universe)

   ·  (closed universe, such as a sphere)

   ·  (open universe, such as a hyperbola)

In terms of the scale factor a, this metric also distinguishes between static, expanding, and shrinking
universes:

   ·  (static universe)

   ·  (expanding universe)

   ·  (shrinking universe)

The scale factor a and the curvature k are determined from Einstein's general theory of relativity. If we treat

the universe as a gas of galaxies of density and pressure p, and assume       (a flat universe), than the scale

factor a is given by

                                                                                                           11.15

where G is the universal gravitational constant. (For ordinary matter, we expect the quantity            to be

greater than zero.) If the scale factor is positive (    ), the value of the scale factor "decelerates"

(     ), and the expansion of the universe slows down over time. If the numerator is less than zero

(somehow, the pressure of the universe is negative), the value of the scale factor "accelerates," and the

expansion of the universe speeds up over time. According to recent cosmological data, the universe appears to

be expanding. Many scientists explain the current state of the universe in terms of a very rapid expansion in

the early universe. This expansion is called inflation.

11.7 Evolution of the Early Universe

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 · Describe the evolution of the early universe in terms of the four fundamental forces
 · Use the concept of gravitational lensing to explain astronomical phenomena
 · Provide evidence of the Big Bang in terms of cosmic background radiation
 · Distinguish between dark matter and dark energy

In the previous section, we discussed the structure and dynamics of universe. In particular, the universe
appears to be expanding and even accelerating. But what was the universe like at the beginning of time? In this
section, we discuss what evidence scientists have been able to gather about the early universe and its evolution
to present time.

The Early Universe

Before the short period of cosmic inflation, cosmologists believe that all matter in the universe was squeezed
526  11 · Particle Physics and Cosmology

     into a space much smaller than an atom. Cosmologists further believe that the universe was extremely dense
     and hot, and interactions between particles were governed by a single force. In other words, the four
     fundamental forces (strong nuclear, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and gravitational) merge into one at these
     energies (Figure 11.21). How and why this "unity" breaks down at lower energies is an important unsolved
     problem in physics.

                                           Figure 11.21 The separation of the four fundamental forces in the early universe.

     Scientific models of the early universe are highly speculative. Figure 11.22 shows a sketch of one possible
     timeline of events.

from the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces (or electroweak force). Soon after, the weak nuclear force

separates from the electromagnetic force. The universe is a hot soup of quarks, leptons, photons, and other

particles.

4. Age of nucleons               The universe consists of leptons and hadrons (such as protons, neutrons,

and mesons) in thermal equilibrium. Pair production and pair annihilation occurs with equal ease, so photons

remain in thermal equilibrium:

The number of protons is approximately equal to the number of neutrons through interactions with neutrinos:

The temperature of the universe settles to approximately      --much too cool for the continued production

of nucleon-antinucleon pairs. The numbers of protons and neutrons begin to dominate over their anti-

particles, so proton-antiproton  and neutron-antineutron ( ) annihilations decline. Deuterons (proton-

neutron pairs) begin to form.

5. Age of nucleosynthesis (      to 1000 years): As the universe continues to expand, deuterons react with

protons and neutrons to form larger nuclei; these larger nuclei react with protons and neutrons to form still

larger nuclei. At the end of this period, about 1/4 of the mass of the universe is helium. (This explains the

current amount of helium in the universe.) Photons lack the energy to continue electron-positron production,

so electrons and positrons annihilate each other to photons only.

6. Age of ions (    to 3000 years): The universe is hot enough to ionize any atoms formed. The universe

consists of electrons, positrons, protons, light nuclei, and photons.

7. Age of atoms (   to 300,000 years): The universe cools below        and atoms form. Photons do not

interact strongly with neutral atoms, so they "decouple" (separate) from atoms. These photons constitute the

cosmic microwave background radiation to be discussed later.

8. Age of stars and galaxies (   years to present): The atoms and particles are pulled together by gravity

and form large lumps. The atoms and particles in stars undergo nuclear fusion reaction.

To describe the conditions of the early universe quantitatively, recall the relationship between the average
thermal energy of particle (E) in a system of interacting particles and equilibrium temperature (T) of that
system:

     Nucleons form at energies approximately equal to the rest mass of a proton, or 1000 MeV. The temperature
     corresponding to this energy is therefore

     Temperatures of this value or higher existed within the first second of the early universe. A similar analysis
     can be done for atoms. Atoms form at an energy equal to the ionization energy of ground-state hydrogen (13
     eV). The effective temperature for atom formation is therefore

     This occurs well after the four fundamental forces have separated, including forces necessary to bind the
     protons and neutrons in the nucleus (strong nuclear force), and bind electrons to the nucleus (electromagnetic
     force).

     Nucleosynthesis of Light Elements

     The relative abundances of the light elements hydrogen, helium, lithium, and beryllium in the universe
     provide key evidence for the Big Bang. The data suggest that much of the helium in the universe is primordial.
     For instance, it turns out that that 25% of the matter in the universe is helium, which is too high an abundance
     and cannot be explained based on the production of helium in stars.

     How much of the elements in the universe were created in the Big Bang? If you run the clock backward, the
     universe becomes more and more compressed, and hotter and hotter. Eventually, temperatures are reached
     that permit nucleosynthesis, the period of formation of nuclei, similar to what occurs at the core of the Sun.
     Big Bang nucleosynthesis is believed to have occurred within a few hundred seconds of the Big Bang.

     How did Big Bang nucleosynthesis occur? At first, protons and neutrons combined to form deuterons, . The
     deuteron captured a neutron to form triton, --the nucleus of the radioactive hydrogen called tritium.
     Deuterons also captured protons to make helium . When captures a proton or captures a neutron,
     helium results. At this stage in the Big Bang, the ratio of protons to neutrons was about 7:1. Thus, the
     process of conversion to used up almost all neutrons. The process lasted about 3 minutes and almost

      were also formed. The expansion during this time cooled the universe enough that the nuclear reactions
stopped. The abundances of the light nuclei , , and created after the Big Bang are very dependent on
the matter density.

The predicted abundances of the elements in the universe provide a stringent test of the Big Bang and the Big
Bang nucleosynthesis. Recent experimental estimates of the matter density from the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) agree with model predictions. This agreement provides convincing evidence of the
Big Bang model.

Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation

According to cosmological models, the Big Bang event should have left behind thermal radiation called the
cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). The intensity of this radiation should follow the blackbody
radiation curve (Photons and Matter Waves). Wien's law states that the wavelength of the radiation at peak
intensity is

                                                                                                                                                   11.17

where T is temperature in kelvins. Scientists expected the expansion of the universe to "stretch the light," and
the temperature to be very low, so cosmic background radiation should be long-wavelength and low energy.

In the 1960s, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson of Bell Laboratories noticed that no matter what they did, they
could not get rid of a faint background noise in their satellite communication system. The noise was due to
radiation with wavelengths in the centimeter range (the microwave region). Later, this noise was associated
with the cosmic background radiation. An intensity map of the cosmic background radiation appears in Figure
11.23. The thermal spectrum is modeled well by a blackbody curve that corresponds to a temperature

              (Figure 11.24).

Figure 11.23 This map of the sky uses color to show fluctuations, or wrinkles, in the cosmic microwave background observed with the

only one part in one million. (credit: NASA/WMAP Science Team)

     Smoot/NASA COBE Project)

     The formation of atoms in the early universe makes these atoms less likely to interact with light. Therefore,
     photons that belong to the cosmic background radiation must have separated from matter at a temperature T
     associated with 1 eV (the approximate ionization energy of an atom) . The temperature of the universe at this
     point was

     According to cosmological models, the time when photons last scattered off charged particles was
     approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Before that time, matter in the universe was in the plasma
     form and the photons were "thermalized."

     Antimatter and Matter

     We know from direct observation that antimatter is rare. Earth and the solar system are nearly pure matter,
     and most of the universe also seems dominated by matter. This is proven by the lack of annihilation radiation
     coming to us from space, particularly the relative absence of 0.511-MeV rays created by the mutual
     annihilation of electrons and positrons. (Antimatter in nature is created in particle collisions and in decays,
     but only in small amounts that quickly annihilate, leaving almost pure matter surviving.)
     Despite the observed dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe, the Standard Model of particle
     interactions and experimental measurement suggests only small differences in the ways that matter and
     antimatter interact. For example, neutral kaon decays produce only slightly more matter than antimatter. Yet,
     if through such decay, slightly more matter than antimatter was produced in the early universe, the rest could
     annihilate pair by pair, leaving mostly ordinary matter to form the stars and galaxies. In this way, the vast

number of stars we observe may be only a tiny remnant of the original matter created in the Big Bang.

Dark Matter and Dark Energy

In the last two decades, new and more powerful techniques have revealed that the universe is filled with dark
matter. This type of matter is interesting and important because, currently, scientists do not know what it is!
However, we can infer its existence by the deflection of distant starlight. For example, if light from a distant
galaxy is bent by the gravitational field of a clump of dark matter between us and the galaxy, it is possible that
two images of the same galaxy can be produced (Figure 11.25). The bending of light by the gravitational field of
matter is called gravitational lensing. In some cases, the starlight travels to an observer by multiple paths
around the galaxy, producing a ring (Figure 11.26).

Based on current research, scientist know only that dark matter is cold, slow moving, and interacts weakly
with ordinary matter. Dark matter candidates include neutralinos (partners of Z bosons, photons, and Higgs
bosons in "supersymmetry theory") and particles that circulate in tiny rings set up by extra spatial
dimensions.

seen.

     Increasingly precise astronomical measurements of the expanding universe also reveal the presence of a new

     form of energy called dark energy. This energy is thought to explain larger-than-expected values for the

     observed galactic redshifts for distant galaxies. These redshifts suggest that the universe is not only

     expanding, but expanding at an increasing rate. Virtually nothing is known about the nature and properties of

     dark energy. Together, dark energy and dark matter represent two of the most interesting and unsolved

     puzzles of modern physics. Scientists attribute      of the energy of the universe to dark energy,          to

     dark matter, and just  to the mass-energy of ordinary particles (Figure 11.27). Given the current great

     mystery over the nature of dark matter and dark energy, Isaac Newton's humble words are as true now as they

     were centuries ago:

     "I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the
     sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary,
     whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."

1.3 air to water, because the condition that the second medium must have a smaller index of refraction is not

     satisfied

1.5       becomes longer,  tilts further away from the surface, and the refracted ray tilts away from the

     normal.

1.7 There will be only refraction but no reflection.

Conceptual Questions

1. Light can be modeled as a ray when devices are large compared to wavelength, and as a wave when devices
    are comparable or small compared to wavelength.

3. This fact simply proves that the speed of light is greater than that of sound. If one knows the distance to the
    location of the lightning and the speed of sound, one could, in principle, determine the speed of light from
    the data. In practice, because the speed of light is so great, the data would have to be known to impractically
    high precision.

5. Powder consists of many small particles with randomly oriented surfaces. This leads to diffuse reflection,
    reducing shine.

7. "toward" when increasing n (air to water, water to glass); "away" when decreasing n (glass to air)
9. A ray from a leg emerges from water after refraction. The observer in air perceives an apparent location for

    the source, as if a ray traveled in a straight line. See the dashed ray below.

11. The gemstone becomes invisible when its index of refraction is the same, or at least similar to, the water
      surrounding it. Because diamond has a particularly high index of refraction, it can still sparkle as a result
      of total internal reflection, not invisible.

13. One can measure the critical angle by looking for the onset of total internal reflection as the angle of
      incidence is varied. Equation 1.5 can then be applied to compute the index of refraction.

15. In addition to total internal reflection, rays that refract into and out of diamond crystals are subject to
      dispersion due to varying values of n across the spectrum, resulting in a sparkling display of colors.

19. No. Sound waves are not transverse waves.
21. Energy is absorbed into the filters.
23. Sunsets are viewed with light traveling straight from the Sun toward us. When blue light is scattered out of

      this path, the remaining red light dominates the overall appearance of the setting Sun.
25. The axis of polarization for the sunglasses has been rotated .

Conceptual Questions

1. Virtual image cannot be projected on a screen. You cannot distinguish a real image from a virtual image
    simply by judging from the image perceived with your eye.

3. Yes, you can photograph a virtual image. For example, if you photograph your reflection from a plane
    mirror, you get a photograph of a virtual image. The camera focuses the light that enters its lens to form an
    image; whether the source of the light is a real object or a reflection from mirror (i.e., a virtual image) does
    not matter.

5. No, you can see the real image the same way you can see the virtual image. The retina of your eye effectively
    serves as a screen.

7. The mirror should be half your size and its top edge should be at the level of your eyes. The size does not
    depend on your distance from the mirror.

9. when the object is at infinity; see the mirror equation
11. Yes, negative magnification simply means that the image is upside down; this does not prevent the image

      from being larger than the object. For instance, for a concave mirror, if distance to the object is larger than
      one focal distance but smaller than two focal distances the image will be inverted and magnified.
13. answers may vary
15. The focal length of the lens is fixed, so the image distance changes as a function of object distance.
17. Yes, the focal length will change. The lens maker's equation shows that the focal length depends on the
      index of refraction of the medium surrounding the lens. Because the index of refraction of water differs
      from that of air, the focal length of the lens will change when submerged in water.
19. A relaxed, normal-vision eye will focus parallel rays of light onto the retina.
21. A person with an internal lens will need glasses to read because their muscles cannot distort the lens as
      they do with biological lenses, so they cannot focus on near objects. To correct nearsightedness, the power
      of the intraocular lens must be less than that of the removed lens.
23. Microscopes create images of macroscopic size, so geometric optics applies.
25. The eyepiece would be moved slightly farther from the objective so that the image formed by the objective
      falls just beyond the focal length of the eyepiece.

Conceptual Questions

1. No. Two independent light sources do not have coherent phase.

3. Because both the sodium lamps are not coherent pairs of light sources. Two lasers operating independently

     are also not coherent so no interference pattern results.

5. Monochromatic sources produce fringes at angles according to                . With white light, each

     constituent wavelength will produce fringes at its own set of angles, blending into the fringes of adjacent

     wavelengths. This results in rainbow patterns.

7. Differing path lengths result in different phases at destination resulting in constructive or destructive

     interference accordingly. Reflection can cause a          phase change, which also affects how waves interfere.

     Refraction into another medium changes the wavelength inside that medium such that a wave can emerge

     from the medium with a different phase compared to another wave that travelled the same distance in a

     different medium.

9. Phase changes occur upon reflection at the top of glass cover and the top of glass slide only.

11. The surface of the ham being moist means there is a thin layer of fluid, resulting in thin-film interference.

      Because the exact thickness of the film varies across the piece of ham, which is illuminated by white light,

      different wavelengths produce bright fringes at different locations, resulting in rainbow colors.

13. Other wavelengths will not generally satisfy               for the same value of t so reflections will result in

      completely destructive interference. For an incidence angle , the path length inside the coating will be

      increased by a factor         so the new condition for destructive interference becomes               .

1. The diffraction pattern becomes wider.

3. Walkie-talkies use radio waves whose wavelengths are comparable to the size of the hill and are thus able to

     diffract around the hill. Visible wavelengths of the flashlight travel as rays at this size scale.

5. The diffraction pattern becomes two-dimensional, with main fringes, which are now spots, running in

     perpendicular directions and fainter spots in intermediate directions.

7. The parameter               is the arc angle shown in the phasor diagram in Figure 4.7. The phase difference

     between the first and last Huygens wavelet across the single slit is and is related to the curvature of the

9. blue; The shorter wavelength of blue light results in a smaller angle for diffraction limit.

11. No, these distances are three orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so visible

     light makes a poor probe for atoms.

13. UV wavelengths are much larger than lattice spacings in crystals such that there is no diffraction. The

Conceptual Questions

    of mechanics, at least, were the same in all inertial frames, but the velocity of a light pulse was different in
    different frames moving with respect to each other

3. yes, provided the plane is flying at constant velocity relative to the Earth; in that case, an object with no
    force acting on it within the plane has no change in velocity relative to the plane and no change in velocity
    relative to the Earth; both the plane and the ground are inertial frames for describing the motion of the
    object

5. The observer moving with the process sees its interval of proper time, which is the shortest seen by any
    observer.

7. The length of an object is greatest to an observer who is moving with the object, and therefore measures its
    proper length.

11. There is no measured change in wavelength or frequency in this case. The relativistic Doppler effect

      depends only on the relative velocity of the source and the observer, not any speed relative to a medium
      for the light waves.
13. It shows that the stars are getting more distant from Earth, that the universe is expanding, and doing so at

15. Yes. This can happen if the external force is balanced by other externally applied forces, so that the net
      external force is zero.
17. Because it loses thermal energy, which is the kinetic energy of the random motion of its constituent
      particles, its mass decreases by an extremely small amount, as described by energy-mass equivalence.
19. Yes, in principle there would be a similar effect on mass for any decrease in energy, but the change would
      be so small for the energy changes in a chemical reaction that it would be undetectable in practice.

3. The Bohr model describes the electron as a particle that moves around the proton in well-defined orbits.

     Schrödinger's model describes the electron as a wave, and knowledge about the position of the electron is

     restricted to probability statements. The total energy of the electron in the ground state (and all excited

     states) is the same for both models. However, the orbital angular momentum of the ground state is different

     for these models. In Bohr's model,         , and in Schrödinger's model,                                     .

5. a, c, d; The total energy is changed (Zeeman splitting). The work done on the hydrogen atom rotates the

     atom, so the z-component of angular momentum and polar angle are affected. However, the angular

     momentum is not affected.

7. Even in the ground state ( ), a hydrogen atom has magnetic properties due the intrinsic (internal)

     electron spin. The magnetic moment of an electron is proportional to its spin.

9. For all electrons,             and           As we will see, not all particles have the same spin quantum number.

     For example, a photon as a spin 1 (        ), and a Higgs boson has spin 0 (  ).

11. An electron has a magnetic moment associated with its intrinsic (internal) spin. Spin-orbit coupling

     occurs when this interacts with the magnetic field produced by the orbital angular momentum of the

     electron.

13. Elements that belong in the same column in the periodic table of elements have the same fillings of their

outer shells, and therefore the same number of valence electrons. For example:

Li:               (one valence electron in the    shell)

Na:               (one valence electron in the                shell)

Both, Li and Na belong to first column.

15. Atomic and molecular spectra are said to be "discrete," because only certain spectral lines are observed.

In contrast, spectra from a white light source (consisting of many photon frequencies) are continuous

because a continuous "rainbow" of colors is observed.

17. UV light consists of relatively high frequency (short wavelength) photons. So the energy of the absorbed

photon and the energy transition ( ) in the atom is relatively large. In comparison, visible light consists

of relatively lower-frequency photons. Therefore, the energy transition in the atom and the energy of the

emitted photon is relatively small.

19. For macroscopic systems, the quantum numbers are very large, so the energy difference ( ) between

adjacent energy levels (orbits) is very small. The energy released in transitions between these closely

space energy levels is much too small to be detected.

21. Laser light relies on the process of stimulated emission. In this process, electrons must be prepared in an

excited (upper) metastable state such that the passage of light through the system produces de-excitations

and, therefore, additional light.

23. A Blu-Ray player uses blue laser light to probe the bumps and pits of the disc and a CD player uses red

laser light. The relatively short-wavelength blue light is necessary to probe the smaller pits and bumps on

a Blu-ray disc; smaller pits and bumps correspond to higher storage densities.

     latter, we get:

      The negative sign indicates that the electron lost energy in the transition.
71.
73. According to the conservation of the energy, the potential energy of the electron is converted completely

      into kinetic energy. The initial kinetic energy of the electron is zero (the electron begins at rest). So, the
      kinetic energy of the electron just before it strikes the target is:

     If all of this energy is converted into braking radiation, the frequency of the emitted radiation is a
     maximum, therefore:

     When the emitted frequency is a maximum, then the emitted wavelength is a minimum, so:

75. A muon is 200 times heavier than an electron, but the minimum wavelength does not depend on mass, so

     the result is unchanged.

     hydrogen atom avoids this possibility because the probability density at    is zero.

89. A formal solution using sums is somewhat complicated. However, the answer easily found by studying the

     mathematical pattern between the principal quantum number and the total number of orbital angular

     For      , the total number of orbital angular momentum states is 1; for    , the total number is 4; and,

     when     , the total number is 9, and so on. The pattern suggests the total number of orbital angular

     (Later, when we consider electron spin, the total number of angular momentum states will be found to be

Conceptual Questions

1. An ionic bond is formed by the attraction of a positive and negative ion. A covalent bond is formed by the

5. Bonding is associated with a spatial function that is symmetric under exchange of the two electrons. In this
    state, the electron density is largest between the atoms. The total function must be antisymmetric (since

21. For N atoms spaced far apart, there are N different wave functions, all with the same energy (similar to the

     case of an electron in the double well of  As the atoms are pushed together, the energies of these N

     different wave functions are split. By the exclusion principle, each electron must each have a unique set of

     quantum numbers, so the N atoms bringing N electrons together must have at least N states.

23. For a semiconductor, there is a relatively large energy gap between the lowest completely filled band and

     the next available unfilled band. Typically, a number of electrons traverse the gap and therefore the

     electrical conductivity is small. The properties of a semiconductor are sensitivity to temperature: As the

     temperature is increased, thermal excitations promote charge carriers from the valence band across the

     gap and into the conduction band.

25. a. Germanium has four valence electrons. If germanium doped with arsenic (five valence electrons), four

     are used in bonding and one electron will be left for conduction. This produces an n-type material. b. If

     germanium is doped with gallium (three valence electrons), all three electrons are used in bonding,

     leaving one hole for conduction. This results in a p-type material.

      hole). If the current density is measured, this effect can also determine the number of charge carriers per
      unit volume.
29. It produces new unfilled energy levels just above the filled valence band. These levels accept electrons
      from the valence band.
31. The electric field produced by the uncovered ions reduces further diffusion. In equilibrium, the diffusion
      and drift currents cancel so the net current is zero. Therefore, the resistance of the depletion region is
      large.
33. The positive terminal is applied to the n-side, which uncovers more ions near the junction (widens the
      depletion layer), increases the junction voltage difference, and therefore reduces the diffusion of holes

      One electron in a pair interacts with the lattice, which interacts with the second electron. The combine
      electron-lattice-electron interaction binds the electron pair together in a way that overcomes their mutual

      interatomic distance between the Si atoms, we find that 1 out of 100 atoms along a linear chain must be a

3. A bound system should have less mass than its components because of energy-mass equivalence
                      If the energy of a system is reduced, the total mass of the system is reduced. If two bricks are

    placed next to one another, the attraction between them is purely gravitational, assuming the bricks are
    electrically neutral. The gravitational force between the bricks is relatively small (compared to the strong
    nuclear force), so the mass defect is much too small to be observed. If the bricks are glued together with
    cement, the mass defect is likewise small because the electrical interactions between the electrons involved
    in the bonding are still relatively small.

     This huge number is indicative of how rarely a neutrino interacts, since large detectors observe very few

     per day.

65. a. The atomic mass of deuterium ( ) is 2.014102 u, while that of tritium ( ) is 3.016049 u, for a total of

     5.032151 u per reaction. So a mole of reactants has a mass of 5.03 g, and in 1.00 kg, there are

                                       of reactants. The number of reactions that take place is therefore

                                                                   .

     The total energy output is the number of reactions times the energy per reaction:

     b. Power is energy per unit time. One year has                   so

     We expect nuclear processes to yield large amounts of energy, and this is certainly the case here. The

     energy output of                  from fusing 1.00 kg of deuterium and tritium is equivalent to 2.6 million

     gallons of gasoline and about eight times the energy output of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Yet the

     average backyard swimming pool has about 6 kg of deuterium in it, so that fuel is plentiful if it can be

     utilized in a controlled manner.

Conceptual Questions

1. Strong nuclear force: interaction between quarks, mediated by gluons. Electromagnetic force: interaction

     between charge particles, mediated photons. Weak nuclear force: interactions between fermions, mediated

     by heavy bosons. Gravitational force: interactions between material (massive) particle, mediate by

     hypothetical gravitons.

3. electron, muon, tau; electron neutrino, muon neutrino, tau neutrino; down quark, strange quark, bottom

     quark; up quark, charm quark, top quark

5. Conservation energy, momentum, and charge (familiar to classical and relativistic mechanics). Also,

     conservation of baryon number, lepton number, and strangeness--numbers that do not change before and

     after a collision or decay.

7. It means that the theory that requires the conservation law is not understood. The failure of a long-

     established theory often leads to a deeper understanding of nature.

9. 3 quarks, 2 quarks (a quark-antiquark pair)

11. Baryons with the same quark composition differ in rest energy because this energy depends on the

      internal energy of the quarks               . So, a baryon that contains a quark with a large angular
590

      momentum is expected to be more massive than the same baryon with less angular momentum.
13. the "linac" to accelerate the particles in a straight line, a synchrotron to accelerate and store the moving

      particles in a circular ring, and a detector to measure the products of the collisions
15. In a colliding beam experiment, the energy of the colliding particles goes into the rest mass energy of the

      new particle. In a fix-target experiment, some of this energy is lost to the momentum of the new particle
      since the center-of-mass of colliding particles is not fixed.
17. The Standard Model is a model of elementary particle interactions. This model contains the electroweak
      theory and quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It describes the interaction of leptons and quarks though
      the exchange of photons (electromagnetism) and bosons (weak theory), and the interaction of quark
      through the exchange of gluons (QCD). This model does not describe gravitational interactions.
19. To explain particle interactions that involve the strong nuclear, electromagnetic, and weak nuclear forces
      in a unified way.
21. No, however it will explain why the W and Z bosons are massive (since the Higgs "imparts" mass to these
      particles), and therefore why the weak force is short ranged.
23. Cosmological expansion is an expansion of space. This expansion is different than the explosion of a
      bomb where particles pass rapidly through space. A plot of the recessional speed of a galaxy is
      proportional to its distance. This speed is measured using the red shift of distant starlight.
25. With distance, the absolute brightness is the same, but the apparent brightness is inversely proportional
      to the square of its distance (or by Hubble's law recessional velocity).
27. The observed expansion of the universe and the cosmic background radiation spectrum.
29. If light slow down, it takes long to reach Earth than expected. We conclude that the object is much closer
      than it really is. Thus, for every recessional velocity (based on the frequency of light, which we assume is
      not disturbed by the slowing), the distance is smaller than the "true" value, Hubble's constant is larger
      than the "true" value, and the age of the universe is smaller than the "true" value.
